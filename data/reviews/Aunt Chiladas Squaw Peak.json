{"text":"Sat at the outside bar with no bartender. A server (Emilie) took it upon herself to help us out and make sure we were taken care of. She was so sweet. Food was amazing as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here was very good. Something that myself and our entire group enjoyed were the complementary flour chips and salsa. We all agreed that it was some of the best we've ever had. The service was okay but we didn't see her very much and we felt pretty rushed to order. Overall we enjoyed the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to try this place out since a friend recommended this place.  
Awesome atmosphere and great service.  
The chips and salsa were so good.  Don't do what I did and filled up on the chips and salsa and didn't have room for the main course.  I think we went through te full baskets of chips and forgot about the real food.

Had the fajita which was HUUUUUGE.  It was enough to feed the Hulk.  Since I filled up on the chips I only ate about 1/4 of it.  
Also ordered the combo siete.  The tamale was okay, not to my taste, but the taco and enchilada made up for it.  

We'll be coming back here when we are craving mexican food that's for sure."}
{"text":"The Food: Average Mexican Fare.  It's not the best you have ever had, but not the worst either.  Aunt Chilada's best point is the patio.  Go for happy hour, or a light dinner.  Sit on the patio, have a few beers, and some apps.  Take out of towners and locals.  Play some bocce and chill."}
{"text":"We came here during spring break, so it was crowded and we waited about 1/2 an hour. We got seated and our orders were promptly taken. The staff is super nice! They were smiley and friendly. But our food was just okay.

My dad ordered a dish that was supposed to come with peppers and onions and a bunch of stuff (maybe a burrito or something, I can't remember). What he got was fine, but later that night he realized it definitely didn't include all that the menu had described. 

I had a \"special order\", I asked for just tortillas on the side, and chicken and onions. When I got my food I had tomatoes mixed in with my chicken and onions... it wasn't a big deal, they were small pieces, but still... I thought it would be easy since I'd specified. Besides that though, my food was lukewarm and the foil-wrapped tortillas weren't even hot. 

My mom's food just didn't show up at first. Apparently they had some issue in the kitchen or something... the waitress acted quickly and the food came a few minutes later, so the issue was resolved. 

The best part of the meal, in my opinion, was the warm tortilla chips they serve. Chips and salsa, yum yum! 

Overall though, the food was okay, some of it was warm, some of it wasn't... nothing special about it though. Just a good dinner. Average."}
{"text":"Classic Mexican fare with a little twist.  Fideo is a nice touch that went over well with my adolescent daughters.  The signature dish has to be the chipotle cream chicken.  Wait staff was a little slow, but responsive and engaging.  Margaritas were good, too."}
{"text":"Not good. The patio is top notch for relaxing if the weather's good but I couldn't shake that chain feeling when inside. Table and chairs had a slightly sticky feeling to them (nice, eh?). Food was typical pre-cooked, oven heated dollop of too much grease and cheese. Not impressed. It's a shame cause the garden and even the nachos & salsa had me expecting big things."}
{"text":"On a Sunday night in July, we met up with some out of town friends who were staying at a local hotel.  The location was perfect for them - so, I called and made a reservation for our group.

When we first arrived, the bar area was vacant - with the exception of one other table of 2 customers.  Since we had called ahead and let them know that our group would be there at 7, I was hoping for, at least, good service.

Unfortunately, the service was really slow. More than once, someone from our group had to go find our server and request service.  Ugh!  While the conversation from our friends really kept us entertained, it's kind of sad when the server can't seem to remember why she came to work (make money?)

While I didin't personally try one, the consensus was the margaritas were more like tequila shooters with fozen ice thrown in - which is fine if that's what you're ordering.

Would we come back?  Maybe - if we have other friends staying locally.  

Would I recommend it?  Not sure.  

Plus Side:  Great patio with sand bowling.  Would be a great during the winter months."}
{"text":"The wait staff was very nice and the outdoor atmosphere was great but as for the food, I've had better Mexican in Indiana and North Carolina......and this is Phoenix,  for Christ's sake! I know, i live here. sizzle in the fajita. They served refried beans and rice a roni. Never had pasta in a Mexican restaurant. Did the run out of arroz.....real rice. Better Mexican at the Bell."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! Service was perfect, food was amazing, price was reasonable, and the atmosphere was terrific. Authentic and clean Mexican food. Definitely a new fav and on the list to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Wednesday night. We were staying across the street at the Hilton and it was nice to be able to walk there. Food was average. The flour tortilla chips were good. The service was fast. Price was reasonable. Not sure who thought it was a good idea to serve pasta with mexican."}
{"text":"Before anything, I have to say that the thing that stood out most to me was the staff of this restaurant. Every time I come, the servers and bar staff are amazingly friendly and greet customers in an inviting way. The servers start guests out with flour and corn chips with the salsa, which me and my group happily scarfed down. They are always warm and fresh. The food is good, and the drinks are exquisite, with enough options for everyone. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice meal with a cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here tonight and loved the chips and salsa. The flour tortilla chips were pretty bomb. 
Waiter was nice, a little nervous though. 
Ordered the vegan fajitas and they brought out a stir fry of vegetables with lettuce cups ( I didn't know I would have to make my own food ) 

Good local/ family owned place. It was also my birthday and they gave me a free ice cream"}
{"text":"Marie, our amazing and professional bartender/server was friendly and helpful when deciding on food and drinks! The service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious! Come get your ice cold beers and amazing Street tacos here!"}
{"text":"Aunt Chiladas is amazing!! I had the chicken pechugas. They were really good. Melted cheese over a chicken enchilada. The beer was really cold and the staff was amazing! Marie, the bartender was telling me the history of the restaurant and how the place has a haunted history and that following prohibition, they were granted the first liquor license. Everyone was really friendly and it really felt like a home town bar in the neighborhood. I will definitely be back when I am in Phoenix. Big props to to Marie!"}
{"text":"Our first visit. A nice place with a charming al fresco patio - a good place to take out-of-town visitors for a Southwestern experience. Since it's on the Dreamy Draw cycling route and very close to the Arizona Canal cycling path, a fine place to stop and lunch if one's on a ride in the area. The flour chips and salsa were delicious, the fish tacos and the pollo fundido were yum, and ice cold Modelo amber is on tap! Service was fast and attentive - my one complaint is that while a bottle of cold water hit the table immediately, water glasses never did appear.  I suspect that milady wife and I will become regular clients. Food - three and a half stars, service four, and ambience a solid five."}
{"text":"We just moved to the neighborhood and went yesterday for happy hour. The atmosphere is awesome for any occasion. The service was friendly and quick. The food was outstanding! My husband had the Mexican pizza, I had the lettuce wraps, & our friend had the mini chimis (they have a different name on the menu like chingalinga). Nothing was too spicey and after I left I didn't feel overfull or have a stomach ache which is rare bc I'm pregnant. The chips are literally to die for!! I'm thinking of walking over just to buy a bag to take home.!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Phoenix, I go to Aunt Chiladas, it's the best!!  I love, love, love their flour tortilla chips & salsa. Chicken pechugas & pollo fundido are amazing!  The atmosphere is great, it feels like you are on vacation!  I love it!"}
{"text":"Ooohh Aunt Chiladas.  I came here last Friday night and was inside at the bar area with girlfriends.  It was my birthday, and as soon as my waitress, I think her name was Nicole, found out she offered me a birthday shot!  What a great way to start out the night!  Anyway, the food is mediocre but oh boy do they have a great tequila selection.  lets just say I dont remember much past the tequilas shots.  Anyway, if you want to have a great time, be sure to hit up Aunt Chiladas on a Friday night."}
{"text":"The oldest restaurant in Arizona and the food tells you why they've been around so long!!  Outstanding food. The salsa and chips are made fresh and excellent. The outdoor patio is large, covered and unique. The chicken fundito is a must try."}
{"text":"Not good. It took an hour and fifteen to get the food out after the order went in. Then only a partial delivery. My carnitas tacos came out cold and dry. The server did her best but she was fighting an uphill battle. The place is obviously very poorly managed. It made for an unpleasant dinner."}
{"text":"A tasty blast! Games, music, good food, great drinks and an authentic, uplifting atmosphere (especially the huge patio!)  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is decent, but the food is absolutely terrible.  It is nothing but chewy meat covered in cheap cheese and grease.   The quesadillas are served in a pool of grease and the nachos are some of the worst in Phoenix,  The quality is an insult to the prices charged and an affront to good Mexican food.  Stick with the beer."}
{"text":"Fun outdoor bar with food service. 2nd time here; very enjoyable. Food decent; atmosphere lively. Boce ball court nearby for those looking for added fun. Bar tender pleasent on the eyes."}
{"text":"Everyone that worked here was friendly and provides good service. The building also has a lot of history to it as well as the area! This place is worth a visit.

I recommend the healthy shrimp lettuce wraps, so tasty! We came in a Sunday around lunch and they had a chocolate fountain with lots of fruit laying out."}
{"text":"If you enjoy being sat down with a bottle of water and a basket of chips and wait 10 minutes without being greeted by the wait staff, I highly recommend this place.  Can't comment on the food, but the salsa was good."}
{"text":"Nasty. Terrible service, hotel food. Save your money or go to via de los Santos up the road!"}
{"text":"Eh. The food isn't so great here. I like the combo of corn and flour tortilla chips, but that's about it. It's a fun place, but I wouldn't ever choose to go here."}
{"text":"Great old AZ, neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  Great atmosphere and food and Margaritas, I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Well we went there today for a late lunch and first off they serve fried flour tortilla chips with corn chips on the bottom but they will bring a basket of stale corn chips on request. The \"mild\" salsa has corn and olives in it, (who does that) and it had no spice at all, and left a bad after taste. The hot sauce was not any better. The guacamole was very good. We decided we didn't want to chance ordering a meal, so we paid for the guacamole and the beer and got up to leave and on the way out the hostess, who I think is one of the owners with a raspy voice, asked how we enjoyed the food, and she evidently didn't really want to know the the truth because she became indignant so we told her if she didn't want an honest answer she probably shouldn't ask the question.
On the bright side the waiter was extremely nice and understanding but I don't remember his name."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. On a previous trip to Phoenix I went here with friends.  We had a great time sitting outside drinking and catching up.  I thought the food was good; however, I went here with my in laws today and it was NOT good.  I actually returned my food and I NEVER do that! There are so many other mexi places to go in Phoenix don't waist your time at Aunt Chilada's unless you are only getting drinks (chips and salsa)."}
{"text":"I love the ambience at aunt chiladas.   It's very unique - a good place to have a margarita.  (Although I didn't have one today.)

I had lunch there with a friend today.  I ordered a chili relleno thinking that even with seeds it would be at least as good as the last time I had one.  This one was too salty, the egg was dry and tasteless.  

I took the remains home and put the chips and relleno out to see what wildlife would turn up to eat it.  A javelina showed up.  Even the javelina tried the chili relleno but rejected it!   Dog food and chips were acceptable to the pig.  I reported this to my son who said that definitely the food has gone way down hill over the last several years.   Since this place is in my neighborhood I sincerely hope that they can improve the taste of their food.  I will be watching the food reviews before eating there again."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the food overall, it wasn't bad by any means.  The salsa was tomatoes with stuff but no hot/bite at all.   Yes, the flour tortilla chips were good and nice to have something different.  Just nothing to write home about.  Server was a good server."}
{"text":"I am going to give Aunty Chiladas 3 stars only because I have gone there since I was like 10.  This place has been a staple in the valley before the 51 went by etc etc.  It definitely looks like it has been there for a while and needs a good  asthetic cleaning.  Our table and chairs were sticky and it was pretty dirty outside on the patio.  There were chairs and miscellaneous items on the outside of the restaurant and it needs some TLC.

Chips (flour) are good but salsa has black olives (yuk, personal preference) and the hot stuff tasted like it had vinegar in it.  It has a great patio for daytime drinking.  Overall the food is above average.

I ordered the fish tacos and they were good.  My accomplice ordered a combo with your typical rice, beans, enchilada, taco etc.  The food was hot and good.  It didn't have a wow factor but the price was good and worth the money.

Holy smokes.......The service was awful.  I am not going to mention any names but it was slow in terms of business and even slower in terms of service.  I hope that they do not correlate but they usually do.  C'mon Aunty you are better than this!!!!!!  

If you live in the neighborhood then it is worth going here.  I probably will not make the drive again.  Good luck Aunt Chiladas."}
{"text":"My extended family members like the margaritas here so we have eaten here a few times. I love their fresh flour tortillas and salsa. I ordered the  vegetarian burrito our last visit and was seriously surprised at how they made it. The burrito had steamed cauliflower, broccoli and carrots (think California blend) wrapped in a tortilla. No cheese, no rice, no beans, no peppers, no corn, nothing I might usually expect to find in a vegetarian burrito. It was not good. I'll stick to chips and salsa next trip."}
{"text":"This is a difficult one, because I use to love Aunt Chilada's.  So here's what happened yesterday.  My family decided after much talk that we wanted mexican food, so I suggested AC, because even though I haven't been there in like 3 years, I us to love the food and service.  When we arrived around 3pm, we notice that there were hardly anyone there, my husband thought that was strange.  We decided to sit inside because the outside looked pretty lonely.  The guy at the door directed us to the right of the restaurant, there were one group of two ladies, that were leaving and us... so we wait, and wait, and wait... then a group of about 4 people sat down, and we still waiting... I notice that we didn't even have water, we looked around and there were two girls sitting to what it looks like the back area, complaining and talking, I know cause they were loud.  Out of know where comes this waiter and completely bypass us and went straight to the table that came after us... My husband looked at me got up and we left... that's when the waiter said hi... it was so bad.  What I also noticed is how dirty this place is, the fixture have pounds of dust, everything is dusty and looks dingy, so my though was, what is going on here, my husband responded, if this place looks this bad, I wonder about kitchen... sad, so sad, WHAT HAPPENED TO AUNT CHILADAS...WE ARE NEVER COMING BACK.  Down the street is Los Reyes de la Torta, is on a little strip mall, but the place is clean, service is impeccable and food was amazing... at least something good came out of all this."}
{"text":"The Best Chips and Salsa!

When you go here you need to try the flour chips.

They also have a nice patio that you can have a nice meal under the stars."}
{"text":"The worst service they attended the Anglo first I was there with the family and the customers that were eating were starring at us and talking shit behind our backs so uncomfortable never going to this place again first and last"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and it's great food and lots of it! The atmosphere is funky and fun. Some of these reviews are negative regarding the food. I can't imagine what they had that they didn't like but I haven't had everything on the menu! Everything me and my friends have had has always been perfect."}
{"text":"Be very careful - watch your wallet and don't listen to the waitress - she will tell you they have $3 specials and then charge you $7!!
Food was so-so, I did like the fried flour tortilla chips.  But the red chile burritos are beef and not pork.  They don't serve rice, the pasta like side with carrots and peas is marginal at best.
But its the bait and switch happy hour menu you have to be careful of.  They offer a $3 house margarita, but will charge you $7 saying you ordered a \"BIG\" margarita.  Save your money and go to Carlos O'Briens, Macayos or Top Shelf."}
{"text":"Where else can you celebrate Cinco de Mayo with bands, an ice louge and a bocce tournament? ...no, seriously, where else? Their patio is amazing. 

They have a lighter, more fish-eatin' friendly menu than most of the other Mexican joints in the area. If you've never had it, the fideo is a little like a noodles-from-a-bag dish and I recommend skipping it.

Their salsa is full of flavorful ingredients like black olives, but don't go here looking for fire. You'll have to head elsewhere to bring on the heat."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant several times. Decent food, but not the best Mexican food I've had. Like the atmosphere and patio is nice when weather appropriate.

Service is usually good, but the latest lunch visit would say mediocre service, but acceptable. Left a 15% tip on credit card receipt. When I got my bill, the total was adjusted and worked out to over 20% tip. Not impressed. Not enough money to file a complaint, but based on this, I won't be back.

Be sure to check your credit card statement. Hopefully this is not a regular occurrence and just an unethical employee who should be fired."}
{"text":"Great set up, great location, great flour tortilla chips, but everything else not so great.  I have tried a few different dishes, and they were not very good.  Too bad, it's a cool set up."}
{"text":"We took the family out for dinner on a Thursday night.  The kids wanted chips & salsa, gotta love'm!

It is a bit hidden of the beaten path but Yelp & iPhone map took us right to the front door. 

The patio is really interesting. It was a bit chilly for our taste, but others were bundled up and enjoying the patio. We sat inside near the fireplace. 

The chips & salsa were good, not the best, but not the worst by far.  Three of us shared fajitas and our son had a cheeseburger & fries, very authentic \"Mexican\", only my son!! The burger didn't last long, it must have been awesome because he had already had a basket of chips on his own. We enjoyed our fajitas, our daughter has been on a fajita kick for about three months now. Guess its less expensive than the Prime Rib kick she was on the eight months prior. 

We had a nice evening, but Aunt Chilada's is a bit far for us to drive for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Five stars for the customer service. I called with less than 24 hours and requested the patio for 50+ people. They easily accommodated us and were so helpful in pre-ordering appetizer platters. 
The day of, our servers, Emily and Brittany, were excellent. Got all of our orders and service was very quick. We'll definitely be back the next time we have a corporate event."}
{"text":"We came in to eat on a slower evening during the week.  Everything was great including the margaritas.  Looks like they have a really cool outside patio and told us that they have live music on the weekends.  Can't wait to visit then."}
{"text":"Husband & I went for dinner one Sat nite followed by breakfast the next morning while staying at the Hilton down the street. The spinach & chicken enchiladas were to die for, but the other three meals were mediocre. Service was unimpressive due to MIA and apathetic servers both times. Three stars for cute southwestern patio & enchiladas."}
{"text":"DON'T GO! Don't waste your money, energy time or patience.  Remember .... You will never regain those precious moments of your life back!!!! DON'T DO IT, DON'T GO!! This place was so horrendous, I downloaded the yelp app just to leave a fair warning to any other unsuspecting folks. Seriously. I refuse to use Facebook and here I am writing this review. Here goes. I moved to this neighborhood abt 4 months ago from the East Coast and so many people rave abt this place. It's right by the resort, so I've been thinking that to survive it's gotta be decent right? I've driven by on a weekend, a weeknight... Always packed, no parking anywhere in sight with what appeared to be great and fun outdoor seating and a sprawling interior. So I finally make my way on over today... Mid afternoon on a beautiful Saturday when there's still parking and outdoor seating available. So excited.... I'm thinking... Yay me! Great food, clearly popular, nice spot to sit out and munch on a gorgeous day..... NOT!! Such an unsuspecting lamb I was!!!! Despite poor layout for parking and no clearly marked entrance... I find my way inside only to be wandering around looking for someone to seat me. After a few minutes at the hostess stand, popping my head around the corner to the inside bar with no acknowledgment, I make my way outside to the patio bar and inquire abt seating..... The poor woman behind the bar was fighting with an empty keg or something and only suggested someone would seat me from the (unmanned) hostess stand. I return inside and magically there are two employees there, clearly neither a hostess, no hello, no apology, no smile, no \"hey you have toilet paper on your shoe\"..... NOTHING.... just blank stares. I inquired abt seating. I finally made my way with my mute escort to a table after clearly expecting far too much from them to stop a random conversation to do their job.  It took a good 5-10 minutes before anyone showed up to my table.... Salsa with chips that were fried tortillas or more like the fried noodles in a Chinese restaurant.... A glass bottle of water.... And a waitress that seemed like a strung out 13 year old. I finally gave up asking her to repeat herself as I couldn't hear or understand her (I am a perfectly healthy, multi-lingual 30-something) and just ordered a beer.  It took her a good 10 minutes to deliver and return to take my order. The food? When it finally arrived? Awful. No flavor. The plate was all watery. And she spilled that watery whatever on me because her wrist was too weak when she was delivering my plate. Geesh. The food was not fully cooked through and was cold. It all tasted stale, freezer burned and just plain gross. That outdoor seating? The few tables of people at this time of day were all cramped in the same area with one larger family party.  Rather annoying and unnecessary. Was not once asked how my meal was, if I wanted another drink (maybe a few shots would have taken the edge off??!!?) When my check came? The waitress charged my card for the table next to mine and visa versa and handed us each other's credit card. Then when we both sent her back to correct it, she returned and handed us each the other's void. We had to coach her that neither of us wanted or should have the other's personal info. She seemed annoyed.  And we were so exceptionally calm and nice unlike so many would be. Unreal. Oh!  One more thing....  a bird in the tree above me crapped on my arm right after I was seated. I love animals. I do. I like to believe bird poo is good luck. It's a stretch here. All I can conjure is I was fortunate enough to get that extra napkin early on so I was prepared for the cleanup when she spilled my plate of watery crap on me.  Oh! And I actually got my debit card back and seem to have escaped without food poisoning. But the night is still young. We shall see. What a horrific dump of a place with awful staff and service. Just plain horrible.   NO STARS!!"}
{"text":"I used to work here around 1994 and it looks like they are still using the same tables, table covers, chairs and chair pads. Could definitely use some upgrades. The pechugas were the saving grace... very good because of the creamy sauce it is topped with. The chicken fajitas were terribly bland. I didn't care for the salsa, won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Only gave it five stars ,cause there is no way to give six or seven. The best Mexican food around. Drive 45 minutes to get there. Happy hour has fabulous margueritas at great prices, and the food cannot be beat!. Even the table salsa is top notch. Can't wait to return and take someone who has never been there."}
{"text":"I was curious how Mexican food would be as good in Phoenix as it is in Tucson when I went here for a rehearsal dinner.  We were seated in a separate room in the back for our party but it seemed like a really fun place to hang out.  There was live music, plenty of different areas to sit in, and a lot of people enjoying themselves.  We had a buffet and I was very impressed with the menu options.  One of the dishes was green corn tamales, which I don't regularly see at Mexican restaurants (maybe they take too long to make?) and they were perfectly cooked.  Another surprise was a healthy green salad that really complimented our meal.  Sometimes when I eat Mexican food I don't feel like I am getting enough of a vegetable serving and this went perfectly.  The chips were also a big hit with everyone as they seemed to be fried and were a change from the traditional chip.  I was impressed by the flavorful and chunky salsa as well."}
{"text":"My Hubby found this place doing a drive by for one of his work's properties (he works for Century 21) & thought we should try it out. We met there today for lunch & it was gorgeous out so we sat on the patio.  

Our waitress was Chelsie & she was really sweet! We started off with the chips & salsa. So damn good, the best we've ever had for sure! We decided to get an appetizer, although I regret it now because the chips & salsa were an appetizer in itself! Any way, we got the standard cheese quesadilla with sour cream. It was ok, too greasy for us. For our meals, my Hubs ordered the chicken fajitas & I ordered the shrimp tacos. They offer fideo & beans for sides but it didn't sound appealing to us so we got rice instead. We were already stuffed from the chips & appetizer so we hardly ate our meals but the few bites we did have were yummy!

Overall we liked it here & will definitely be coming back! Maybe even for Cinco de Mayo which our waitress told us all about, sounds like a lot of fun. Either way, next time I come I am getting a margarita & dessert ;)"}
{"text":"Had just gotten off a long flight and wondered into Aunt Chiladas for the first time.  Loved the food and the margaritas !!  Will go back again."}
{"text":"Came into this place & had their fish tacos, I was extremely satisfied ! Not a big fan of their chips though & a first on trying salsa that contains olives. Overall the food was great & I'll definitely come back if I have the opportunity to."}
{"text":"Lets just say it kind of sucked. Stayed at the Pointe across the street and heard good things.  The beer was the best part.. which was bottled.. not here. I do not even remember what I had it was so good. Puffy chips? Who the hell wants wierd puffy chips!? Go somewhere else. On The Border is almost better Mexican food... and that place is terrible!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing based on the 4 star reviews. I used to live in Phoenix and was looking forward to some excellent Mexican food...this was definitely not that. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Okay, you either hate the chips or you love them.  I love them!  We were pleased to see the new menu at Aunt Chilada's... finally some vegetarian options!  The patio is awesome, you can chill in the sun, enjoy cold beers, and play bocce.  Is it the best Mexican food?  No.  But it's tasty, and that combined with the patio makes Aunt Chilada's a great choice."}
{"text":"Aunt chilada restaurant is super good, lot of food, coming on our trip from California to texas, we passed to phoenix and i was searching for pet friendly restaurants,  and i found this one, omg, we got lot of food, chips salsa, food very yummy,  i give 5+star"}
{"text":"Two stars for food taste/ 4 stars for ambiance. 

We had planned to go to another restaurant near 32nd St and Thunderbird but there was a 45 min wait for Sunday breakfast brunch. Aunt Chiladas was the only other restaurant I could remember in the area within 30 min drive. 

This was our 4th time together at AC; my 6th time throughout the years. The food has not gotten any better. It is not anything close to being Mexican. Bland, smothered in bland cheese sauce with a rice-a-roni rice mixture not Mexican rice. Bland salsa. Maybe people who rate it higher either like their bar alcoholic drinks or are visitors from states that don't know Mexican food.   Again the ambiance is nice if you are looking for a restaurant with walking distance of the hotel resort."}
{"text":"The food was good. The chips and salsa were fantastic. The fountain out back was functioning but green with algae. The service was great. I will definitely be back when I can enjoy the patio bar."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are great! Great friendly staff! Awesome homemade hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Flour tortilla chips to die for. Had shrimp tacos cooked to perfection.  My husband had sour cream enchiladas. Every thing was perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible unless all you want to do is drink alcohol.
Nothing but poor service and poorly cooked food. We were not greeted upon entering and had to tell them that we wanted to be seated. We were then brought to a dining room that had ball of the ambience of a school hall with plastic table clothes included. Our server was not even closely familiar with the food or food preparation. When asked how the fideo was prepared, she said, \"they cook it\".  Thanks captain obvious. My husband asked if there was anything spicy and she said the steak and jalapeño fajitas were. He then asked if anything else was and she said \"Well, the steak and jalapeño fajitas are\".....she does not belong waiting on people. 
So the food. The food is microwaved!! Soggy, gross enchilada, mushy and dry tamale, lackluster salsa, fideo that had been in a steam pan since yesterday. The highlight was the almost average fajitas. 
No bueno !"}
{"text":"Bad, just bad.
Food is underwhelming. My friend did not like her wine after one sip and asked the waiter to exchange it for something else. He actually balked and said he would have to check with the manager before he could do that. What???Are you kidding me? Big mistake. Then I tasted my incredibly weak margherita, all sweet, horrible. Yea, they sell you an 18oz. drink, but whats the point if it sucks. Decided not to deal with the bartender directly instead of flustering our waiter again. Walked up to the bar and in a very calm, and nice way explained to the bartender that I was underwhelmed with my drink, that it was too sweet and I could not taste a hint of tequila. Well I guess tha was an insult, and instead of dealing with me as a customer, she told me that she made the drink and there was basically nothing wrong with it and nothing she could do. Really?
This is the type of badly run, corporate restaurant I cannot stand. No owners to deal with, no one that cares, just crappy service and a culture that forgets about the customer. Owners need to go into a Houston's and see how a large corporate restaurant should be run."}
{"text":"My server Anna was amazing. She was so attentive and  caring. She answered all of our questions and handled our food requests with no issue"}
{"text":"Hate to do this to you Aunt Chilada, but my one and only visit to your establishment kinda sucked!

The long story short goes like this:

- Dinner was  maybe 2.5 stars. The Taco De Jeebus just wasn't amazing. Have had much better pork tacos in Phoenix.

- Service at dinner was 1. The guy actually said to our friend \"wow, you're a clean plate club member!\" C'mon Spiffy, you don't say that to a lady, regardless. 

- Beer was a 4. But it was over priced.

- Too many damn families with babies with what appeared to be \"baby SARS.\" If a kid is yacking up straight clear goo, ask the family to take them out of the dining room. By the time we got done eating we were surrounded in Mormon family hell. Maybe they think that Chilada's is Kolab, but sweet little baby jeebus, keep on your patrons so they're not spreading disease.

Where it really went to hell in a hand basket was when we went into the bar...

Maybe it was because we were with our bald Mexican friend Mario. Maybe it was me with my tattoos hanging out of my Brooks Brothers shirt. Maybe it was my pretty girlfriend. Maybe it was Mario's wonderful wife.

But they never came to serve us at our table. Everyone else got table service, but it ended up with Mario and I having to sherpa back and forth from the bar with our drinks. The service really, really sucks in the bar. They weren't busy, the bar wasn't slammed, the 12 pieces of jail bait bar maids were just too lazy to attend to everything.

Won't be going back."}
{"text":"For me, the food is more important than the service so the unfriendly staff has never bothered me. I've been going here about once every two-three weeks for two years. The food is always fantastic so they deserve a high rating!

Food:
The food at Auntchiladas is close to authentic, but that isn't necessarily their goal. They serve a variety of dishes, like the chipotle chicken and the fish tacos, that are somewhat Americanized but are still very good. The el pollo fundido and chipotle chicken are my favorite dishes. The beans aren't loaded with lard so they are not very fattening and the rice is excellent. I order queso or abondigas soup for an appetizer. The free chips and salsa are great!

Service: 
This is where Auntchiladas loses many of their customers. To be fair, we have had some fantastic servers, but the majority of servers have been rather unfriendly. The food comes quickly, but don't expect to have time to fully enjoy it. If the restaurant is packed, the waiter will rush your meal by continuously trying to take your plate. The female servers are often dressed to attract attention. We have been at the restaurant on afternoons where all of the women were dressed in bikini tops! This destroys any attempt at a family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Worst service ever but even worse is management does not care! We've been coming here pretty steady for the past 5 years and the service today was horrible! When we arrived we were greeted and we asked to be seated indoors. We were seated in the back where we sat for 25 minutes before a server came to take our order. Once our drinks came we placed our order. We each ordered a chorizo plate, our order came and upon taking the first bite we found the chorizo was so spicy we could not eat it! We were already frustrated with noone coming to check on us after we had been seated and now the chorizo was too spicy to eat! We waited another 10 minutes, before our server came to our table to check on us, when we finally asked to speak to a manager to let them know about our terrible experience. A manager comes to the table where we tell him about our frustrations with the service and food and his demeanor was very nonchalant. We got the impression he just didn't care. At the end of our conversation he stated \"so tone it down a bit?\" (meaning the chorizo) while he hurriedly walked off as his staff told him \"the linen people were there\". No apology, no care that his restaurant and/or staff weren't doing well, nothing! A simple apology would have been fine. Needless to say, we will never be returning to Aunt Chilada's. Hope Aunt Chilada's remembers they are there because of the customers."}
{"text":"This was a fun place, which had been recommended by a few people I know. A bit difficult to find because of the mostly residential setting and very crowded due to happy hour. 
In all honesty the service was slow though the server did keep coming back to apologize. 
Bonus was that for the healthy eater there were options. Often this is a very difficult task! 
I thought the chips and salsa were good - flour chip ones were great.
I do wish that their \"hot\" salsa had been spicier though I do have a love of exceptionally spicy food & for me, habanero salsa is \"medium\". 
I would definitely go back though. Good evening overall."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are delicious! Had a great time on the patio! Split a pitcher of margaritas and fish taco plate. So good!"}
{"text":"The 5 stars are for the chips and salsa! I had never had the fluffy yet crispy- MELT IN YOUR MOUTH- tortilla chips before. 

It was an experience. 

Even if you order nothing else from the menu, try these. 

That is all. Adios."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite Mexican food restaurant. Best salsa in town. Eat in or on The patio. Great food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had a baby shower here today. Our server, Manny was AWESOME! Food was great! Beautiful day!"}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere-- just not too sure what was going on with the fajitas. 
They were overcooked and oddly spiced. I've been there a few times before, and never had a problem with other entrees."}
{"text":"I just left this restaurant 15 minutes ago and decided to sign up for Yelp to write this review. 

Listen, Aunt Chilada's, before tonight... was a mediocre restaurant near where my boyfriend works. We'd sometimes go there for lunch if we needed a quick bite, and the salsa was good. So it was there to fill our need if we really had nowhere else to go. That being said, tonight was a disaster.

I'm sure it's because they had a few large groups of people who'd already sat down before us in the banquet room, wherever that is. But we waited for over an hour for our food. When it arrived, my burrito had cheese in it (I am lactose intolerant and asked for none). The waiter was courteous and zipped back to get me my correct order, but came back a mere ten seconds later with a cold burrito. Really? I know I've already waited, but at least give it to me warm.

All in all, the server generally ignored us because the table to our left was angry they weren't getting any food, and the table to the right of us had a solid 30 people in it. So, I get it in a sense. But it would've been nice to have them tell us straight out that they had a 46 person table on the other side of the restuarant that just ordered, and that the giant party to our right hadn't gotten their food yet either. It would've saved me a lot of time. Definitely was not worth the money, and never will return again."}
{"text":"Didn't expect much but loved it! Charming interior and food was very good. Salsa and fresh but rather mild. My daughter loved the treasure chest filled with surprises."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant, because we had just arrived at the Arizona Grand Resort and wanted a family friendly restaurant on the resort grounds.  We were surprised by the friendly environment, good food and terrific service.  All of us enjoyed our meals, whether they were house specials or your American-ized combination plates.  A laid back environment with good Mexican food and good margaritas.  It really hit the spot after a 5 hour road trip!"}
{"text":"Used to be a regular here. The past few visits I've noticed a decline in the service. Also noticed a change in the menu along with a price increase, however the quality hasn't improved. We waited over 15 mins for drinks then even longer for food and to receive bill. Overall wasted an hour just on wait time. Waiter wasn't tentative. Won't be returning. Love the owners is the only reason I gave them another chance."}
{"text":"I was really in between a 3 and 4 stars for this place. We came for happy hour which is the bomb. Free chips and salsa, little cheesy tortilla things, and fruit. They had some good drink deals... but I was the lowly DD. Service was slow... and when I say slow I mean like a turtle walking in molasses. It took about 20 minutes just to get a soda. I could have driven to Frys and bought my own. 

The atmosphere is ok, just bar-ish. The food on the normal menu is wayyy over priced for Mexican. I ended up ordering the fancy shmancy hot dog which you can personalize. I asked for guac on mine but didn't get any. It took about 45 minutes to even get my hot dog and I was so hungry I wasn't going to let that thing out of my sight.

 If  you do happen to stumble upon this place ask for the flour tortilla chips-I could live my life happily only eating those things :)"}
{"text":"Great Food & Better Service! Our waitress Emilie was amazing! Prompt, Courteous, Professional 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favorite Mexican food restaurant I've ever been to!!! The chips and salsa were the best I've ever had, the patio had a beautiful atmosphere/environment, and the appetizers/entree were phenomenal! I can't believe this place is only given 3 stars because I would've thought it would have at least 4 star rating, if not 5 stars! You won't regret it if you choose to eat here!!"}
{"text":"Food was average but I give it 2 stars because the service was terrible. I could not escape the smoke from other peoples cigarettes as we were seated outside...there are better Mexican places to eat in Phoenix. I guess that from reading all of the other reviews most come for the drinks so if that is your poison, maybe this place might work but I would not recommend eating here"}
{"text":"Nope. This was not good at all. The servers were friendly but everything tasted like they were microwaveable meals. The lettuce on my plate was actually super wilted and lacked any substance. We ate inside and there were flies and gnats everywhere - one landed in my wine!"}
{"text":"LOVE the flour chips and delicious chunky salsa! Had Dan as my server and he was too rad!!!!! Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Came for Happy about and Emily was so attentive! She gets 5 stars and the happy hour tacos and drinks get 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been here for several years and got a coupon so decided to try again for dinner .  First impression - DARK!   Seriously, so dark we can't read the menu (servers had to provide flashlights) and then could barely see our food.  Food was OK, but a bit pricey for what we got and service was a bit slow and sporadic.  We got a sopapilla for desert and it was strangely salty and sweet.  Overall, \"Meh\" was our reaction.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere, friendly staff.

Patio is dog friendly, they even brought out water for our 130 pound rottie, he loved it! Great place to take the kids, they love the free chocolate fountain.

Chips and salsa are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere, great vibe, and great food. Try the avocado chicken salad or Pollo fundido"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this restaurant but they have poor organization and communication skills. I went in on Tuesday at 2pm and it was very slow. We were moved three times before ordering because the staff said the areas we had been seated in were closed and waiters weren't zoned in that area. It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks and mine came out incorrectly. For a slow period, communication should be on point. It was rare that we were checked on and the fish tacos were very bland and slightly cold by the time I received them. I am willing to give it another shot because I remember a time where the service and food was incredible, but this put me off."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and a fun, unique ambiance in North Phoenix. This is a Spring Training must for us every year. Flour chips and a very hearty salsa to start. Bocci ball while you're waiting to eat and a full bar. We always make a point to sit outside. The food (and variety of choices) is great. Aunt Chiladas does get very crowded in the evenings. Only complaint was a reservation we made and still had to wait an additional 20-25 minutes. Hosts didn't seem too concerned about it. We're in vacation mode when we're here so you just roll with it."}
{"text":"We have been to Aunt Chilada's twice in the last month and each visit was extremely enjoyable.  On the last visit, we sat outside close to the bocce ball court, of which we took advantage to play several games while waiting for our meal.  The chips and salsa are awesome (we all actually like black olives in our salsa, so that is a nice addition to perk it up), with the homemade flour chips our favorite.  My margarita on the rocks was nice and tart.  My daughter and I both got the chile relleno plate; the relleno had just enough spicy heat with a light, crisp batter coating.  My husband said his chicken quesadillla was great, and my son, who is not into Mexican food, had a burger that was cooked perfectly medium.  Tres leches cake made a perfect ending to our meal, and there was enough so that all 4 of us had a healthy portion.  This gem of a restaurant is hidden away off the beaten path... I'm glad we found it!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had since my stay in Arizona for Spring Training!   Fresh taco and salsa...flour and corn mixed.   Cheese crisp was so delicious and the strawberry daiquiri was delicious!  

Service at this place was exceptional and the to go order was super quick.   The decor was cute, too!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! The service, food, margaritas, and atmosphere are truly 5 star. My family and I are staying at the Pointe Hilton across the street so it was a nice walk! We ordered a guac, top shelf margarita pitcher, steak fajitas, and a chimichanga. Very authentic and delicious! I should note we have a 2 year old and he had a little play area to run around. Very family friendly!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Priced perfect. The chips and salsa are to die for ! The food is on point, I have visited this spot over 10 times and will be going back. I loved the friendly service and quick waitress."}
{"text":"Black Olives in Salsa. Who does that? And the hot sauce tastes like BBQ sauce. Seating is very uncomfortable. You sink down in the chairs. This is our third time here as we usually give a place 2-3 chances. Doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Very average (if not below) average \"Mexican\" restaurant that I was invited to for an after work happy hour. The margarita was pretty good but the food was not. It's your typical American style Mexican food which I'm not really a fan of to be honest. I haven't been back and won't go back."}
{"text":"Went here back in May after work to meet up with some folks. The complimentary happy hour grub was alright, nothing to write home about: standard chips, salsa, and, no surprise, enchiladas. They only had really small plates though so it was hard to fit much of anything on them.

Standard Mexican beer selection plus hottie waitresses who looked and dressed as if they could have been working at Hooter's but ended up working here instead because, as luck would have it, there ain't no Hooter's by Squaw Peak....yet. Also, there are pretty large outdoor seating areas with lots of trees around.

Aunt Chilada's isn't a bad place by any means, as you could go much worse when it comes to gringo-ized Mexican joints, but it's nothing much special either, college-age hottie waitresses notwithstanding."}
{"text":"I first visited this restaurant back in the mid 1990s and enjoyed everything about it -- the setting, the ambiance, the food, the staff, and the entire experience of being in a historic setting.  Being that I reside in southern California, I hadn't really enjoyed the opportunity of returning until now.  Exactly as I recalled!  This visit, I brought a friend who is a new citizen of Phoenix.  We both raved at how Aunt Chiladas is a tremendous step up from your average Mexican food eatery -- on many levels.  The staff was friendly and attentive -- especially our waiter, Patrick.  We modified our choices slightly off- menu, and Patrick offered suggestions that might enhance our orders.  He knows his stuff!  My friend told me he'll be bringing people in whenever they visit, and thanked me for finding the place for him.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"Love the homemade chips and salsa!! The hostess Nadia was so friendly and gave us a great seat!! The restaurant has great food and a fun and upbeat feel to it. This is definitely our go to local Mexican food spot!!"}
{"text":"Hard to find but great street tacos....also loved the shrimp fajitas.   The place can get a little packed with the hipster crowd, but the service is great and the atmosphere feels authentic.  Plenty of space for a large party or event outside with catering and music.   The bar area is cozy  and the servers are friendly.  Not the best Mexican food around, but a good spot for a bite to eat and some trivia!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved here from Chicago and we've have Mexican food every Saturday for the last 2 years.  Needless to say, we've been on the hunt for the best Mexican restaurant here in the Phoenix area since we moved here 2 months ago.  Our criteria is simple:  (1) Margaritas, (2) chips and salsa, and (3) food and fajitas.

(1) Margaritas --  Thumbs up!  So far Aunt Chiladas has the best Margaritas I've had in the valley and we've been to quite a few places including Tee Pee (where the food is good but the Margaritas suck).  We ordered the hand shaken margarita and its a pretty big serving with lots of the good stuff in it...

(2)  Chips and Salsa -   Thumbs up!  The chips are unusual in that they are flour not corn and come out nice and hot.  We liked the salsas and I love black olives so the fact it was in the salsa was a big yum factor for me.

(3)  Food/Fajitas - Thumbs up!  We ordered a few different things including the Chingalingas (yum!), steak fajitas, and enchiladas.  We also really liked that they give noodles (fideos) with refried beans instead of rice.  Those are awesome.  The steak fajitas were the bomb

The only downside is the service is just way too slow.  I mean, we waited and waited and waited.  They were nice enough but bring a pillow because it'll be a while!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent, nothing too special. Salsa could have been way better. Did not appreciate the waiter trying to upsale us every chance he got. \"No, we are sure we don't want any alcoholic beverages or guacamole\" for the third time. Of course he still got me when he asked if I wanted sour cream on the side for my quesadilla. And of course the side of sour cream was way too big for one person and cost an extra $2. Pretty lame!"}
{"text":"We have always loved this restaurant. The food is great, and the service was always great. 

Until today. 

The service was terrible. It took nearly an hour to get our food-the whole lunch took nearly two. The server \"forgot\" to note a gluten allergy on one dish. Our glasses sat empty most of the meal. All this despite a nearly empty restaurant. 

When told about this experience, two separate servers were indifferent, offering only a toke. \"Sorry\". 

We won't be back. Pity. This place was a favorite."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant down the street from our hotel. The staff is very friendly. They even have a treasure chest kids can pick a toy from after dinner!"}
{"text":"We threw a 70th birthday party for my best friend of 50 years in May. For a variety of reasons we required a lot of accommodations (speakers, a mic, projector, screen for a slide show...and lots of margaritas.) And boy did they really came through for us! But here's the kicker, we brought all of that equipment with us from California, but couldn't get it to work. So Steve, the manager stepped up and offered to loan us their equipments...which worked beautifully. Michelle, our event planner was excellent as well; responsive, helpful and creative in problem solving.

Even though the whole restaurant was very busy that night we had excellent service and attention. The food was FABULOUS, the atmosphere was ideal and the party was a big success. I told them at the end of the event that I was going to write a rave review, that they had earned, and I hope this lives up to it. They deserve it.  I wish I could have given 6 or 7 stars.  
BTW, my husband was in the hospitality business for 40 years, so we know a bit about great service and Aunt Chiladas delivered. Too bad they're not in the SF Bay Area! If my review isn't clear, then I hope this is: I HIGHLY recommend Aunt Chiladas (the one on Dreamy Draw,) especially for special events."}
{"text":"We were here for a private anniversary party so the seating was fantastic in the small, private dining area. The food was delicious. It was served buffet style but presentation was beautiful and the food was well seasoned.

Parking was a bit cramped but the restaurant was also quite busy, but we were lucky to get a close parking space.

The house red wine they served was very good and their chips and salsa were also a great addition to the meal."}
{"text":"Local friends brought us by after a long trip- perfect spot to recharge and fuel up in the desert.

Cool atmosphere, relaxed and comfortable.  Lots of families here for Sunday evening dinner.

Our waitstaff was fantastic!  Quick service, no empty glasses or chip bowls - and they kept the salsa coming too.

Two words: questo fundido
Get some.  Now!"}
{"text":"This place has gone so downhill. If I hadnt gotten my chips, salsa & water immediately, I wouldve walked out. Margaritas are always awesome. But the service and food is straight up AWFUL. Microwaved enchiladas, no rice, rude, cold, unfriendly, uninviting service...If you're looking for a fabulous, neighborhood mexican restaurant, try Las Glorias Grill. The location isnt as great, but the food, service and drinks, blows this place outta the water. After years of going to aunt chiladas, Im NEVER going back again. They dont deserve your money either...."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican Restaurant in Phoenix,Arizona.The service here is fantastic and the food here is delicious"}
{"text":"Living in San Diego, I expect authentic Mexican food when I go out to eat at a Mexican Restaurant.  Sadly, I did not get that here.  The wait staff was very attentive; I will give them that.  The kid's meals were large portions, and their kids french fries were actually really good.  The chicken fingers looked a little scary, and the quesadilla had very little cheese on it (the part my 1 year old will actually eat).  My chicken fajitas were fair, at best.  The guacamole was pretty good, as were the refried beans.  I have no idea what the Mexican rice was all about - it looked like cut up spaghetti noodles with Mexican spices in it.  It was not rice.  The chips that everyone raved about?  I wasn't a fan.  They tasted like rejects from a taco salad shell to me."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere, great staff, especially Madison. She was attentive and efficient and made our time they're very very entertaining. Thanks to all at this wonderful place, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Their new menu is AMAZING!! The grilled Basa fish is to die for!!! 

And they have Foursquare AND Facebook specials! So i got a FREE messy sundae and a FREE pint of their famous salsa all just for \"Checking-in\" AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix over the weekend for a swim meet and we came here on a recommendation from another family on a different team.  We had a large table and everyone left happy and full!  First, the chips and salsa were delish!  Our meals were top notch! Best Chili Relleno I have EVER had!  Then the kids found the chocolate fountain, Oh my!   The chef came out and gave us a history of the restaurant.  We had alot of fun and enjoyed our meal.  We highly recommend Aunt Chilada's. Cant wait to be in the area again for another swim meet! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have dreams of aunt chiladas' fried dishes... Dear god - they are good. I was recently staying up the road for a business trip and visited here twice... If i had stayed longer, i would have gone again. The salsa was a bit odd with olives in it, but the flavor was good, and it's hard to go wrong dipping into it with fresh fried tortilla chips. I'm sure i gained an extra ten lbs each time i ate here, but i'd go again no doubt.

Service here really depends on the wait staff. The first time we went, the waitress was amazing and attentive; the second... Lets just say we waited 30 mins for her to pick up the credit card to pay."}
{"text":"This place is a little tucked away hidden treasure! The venue is awesome with so many areas to sit and enjoy. The Yelp event I went to had the exclusive use of the large outdoor patio - totally cool, right? It is so open and had great space for the stage, the buffet set up and other little fun attractions set up around the place....hello beer burro! It immediately had me thinking about what kind of party or celebration I could have on this patio...guess that means I'm sold on the venue, huh?
The food was great and offered a lot of variety. My favorites were the tamale and the desserts. The service was excellent and the staff was super friendly. Definitely a fun place to stop by for a good meal, a good drink or if you want to have a full on fiesta with you and 50 of your closest friends! Ole!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and outdoor area.    Bocci ball court is awesome. If you don't know how to play somebody will help you. When we were there one of the refs was giving us lessons. I was able to find to my skills and become a world champion bocci ball player in just one hour and five margaritas. It was simply amazing.  If only the sport was in the Olympics.  However this does not offset the fact that (in my opinion) the food is not great. Even the chips are bad. How can you have a Mexican restaurant with bad chips?"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a group of 4. We called at about 5:30 and were thankfully able to make a reservation at 7. We were staying at the Hilton down the street and when we arrived, we were quickly seated.

Service was prompt and quite friendly. Our drink order was taken almost too quickly has half of the table hadn't looked at the menu yet. I tried a lucky (something?) margarita and it was delicious ($7.50). I had to be sure to stir it often though as the agave syrup would settle. Beer was served nice and cold and my Mom enjoyed a (tiny) mimosa. It was disappointing to hear that all of their margarita flavours were syrups vs real juice, especially as an entire page of the drink menu is marg options.

Food wise, my dad and I each enjoyed the combo fajitas (steak and chicken) and my mom and husband had combo plates. Portion sizes are definitely ample as none of us managed to finish and we definitely didn't leave hungry. Meat portions on the fajitas were very tiny, as I was down to onions and peppers after my second tortilla. I enjoyed the fideo pasta vs traditional rice, though consistently have an issue with mixed peas and carrots being added. They overcook and shrivel to sad little rocks.

Overall, we enjoyed our meals. Not sure that we would rush back for food, but the outdoor patio definitely looks like a nice place for drinks on a hot day."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place!  Food was amazing, service was great.  Got introduced to fideo..  definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My buddy Mike took me here after we played golf recently. We wanted something with \"chips and salsa\" and a decent beer selection. Their chips and salsa are served community style, and the beer selection rocks. Winning! Oh, and the chips are corn AND flour. The place is really big, too, and has a classic vibe to it. I ordered the seafood enchiladas, and they were terrible. Told the server and she took them away and brought me something else. Just a really good experience. They have a Living Social right now, too, so we will be going back. Thanks, Mike!"}
{"text":"Was here for the 5th meeting of the Breakfast Club UYE. Such a great group with a few regulars and a rotating band of others. I always enjoy meeting new people and it is good to see the regulars as always.
It being Cinco De Mayo month a Mexican theme was chosen and Aunt Chilada's was the place. I have been to the Tempe location a few times but I think I might prefer this one. The patio area was really great. The weather was perfect to sit outside. Probably the last time it will be. I like the fact that the main restaurant has been there forever. I like historic old buildings.
We sat down and a few others trickled in. Our waitress brought us out the chips and salsa and also informed us to not leave the table unattended because the birds will have no problem stealing your chips. She took our drink orders and once everyone was seated and ready our food orders. I settled on the Chorizo con Huevos with the eggs over easy.
My food was very good. According to the menu the dish contained Jesus's homemade chorizo which was \"heavenly\", wacka wacka. I have never had this before but the eggs with the meat was very good. It was all stacked on a crispy blue corn tortilla. It came with a side of re-fried beans which had a little bit of a skin on them but once I stirred them up they were fine. The entire meal was delicious.
They do include a chocolate fountain with all breakfasts but I am not that into fruit so just had a few chocolate covered marshmallows.
I will say that the service was a little slow but with all of the great conversations going on it was a little hard to notice. Plus it did take a little while to get our checks and get them paid but the waitress did split them up for us which they don't usually do for a group as big as ours. Overall she did a great job for having two large parties plus other tables to deal with.
I would like to go back again and try the other breakfast items plus maybe some of the dinner selections."}
{"text":"If eating in a filthy daycare center is your idea of a great dining experience, this is a must try place for you!  We stopped in for brunch last Saturday when we were feeling in an adventurous mood and looking to deviate from our tried and true brunch spots.  It was a beautiful day so we asked to be seated outside and as the hostess lead us to our table, it became apparent that there was NOWHERE on the patio and perhaps the entire restaurant that would offer us any solace from the excessive number of running, screaming, sticky fingered children who had apparently consumed too much sugar at the chocolate fountain.

Now, I understand that when sitting outside in the Phoenix area, tables and chairs aren't always spotless due to the dust factor, but one would have expected that our plastic tablecloth would have at least been wiped down sufficiently to remove the layers of food that had accumulated over what I'm guessing was at least the past few months.  After a significant wait, a server (not ours) showed up with some water that was served in glasses designed to hold enough liquid to quench a toddler's thirst (although, given the number of toddlers present, perhaps this was intentional) and some chips, salsa, and hot sauce.  The chips were of both the flour and corn tortilla varieties and were rather heavy on the grease.  The salsa was so mild, the only real flavor that it had was that of the sliced black olives in it, which is not necessarily a quality one seeks in a salsa.  The \"hot\" sauce was actually just as mild as the salsa and was served in a glass bottle that was so filthy and had so much food stuck to the outside of it that my hands were actually sticky from touching it.  At long last, our waiter finally showed up to take our drink order: a mimosa for me and a bloody mary for my husband.  After another ten minutes, he finally reappeared with the drinks and had I not been quick to cover my white shorts with my napkin, we would have been heading home for me to change since he'd spilled the bloody mary while carrying it and cluelessly reached across me with it to set the drink in front of my husband, causing a stream of spilled tomato juice to run down the plastic tablecloth and onto my legs.

The only redeeming factor that pulled this place up to three stars was actually the food.  I ordered a two item combo with a cheese enchilada and a bean & guacamole tostada and when the food finally arrived, it was clear a one item combo would have been more than enough as both items were huge.  All of the tostada ingredients were fresh and tasty and the cheese enchilada was flavorful too.  My husband had the huevos rancheros which he also thought were quite good.  This place is definitely a good value for the price as it's very inexpensive, but having heard that they actually host wedding receptions here, I would have expected a lot more in terms of the atmosphere and service.  It's a place that we won't hurry back to, but won't cross off the list as I've definitely had far worse food and overall dining experiences at other Mexican restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  They had some real good food.  Felt very authentic... or at least southwest mexican good!"}
{"text":"Good service and God awful food!!! One star b/c of great service brought it up... And could not go lower. 

OMG the food was horrible and lacked taste at best.  The guac was worse than what comes from a bag!! 

We had a table of 8, service was great! Food weak bland, lacked interest or taste. The only dish that appeared worth ordering was the street tacos. 

The jalapeño steak fajitas were tough as leather and well tastes the same. 

How does a place like this survive in Phoenix?  Oh must be east coast tourist, well thank goodness for them. 

That is all."}
{"text":"Located at the resort at South Mountain the small Mexican gem has been around for a long time.

Quick delicious flavorful food.  I ordered the tostada with a couple sides.  I loved it!  Great chips and salsa.  Excellent margaritas.

We ate inside and it was a little loud.  Next time we will eat On Their patio."}
{"text":"FYI... I am not a lover of spicy foods.  I was able to ask for...and receive...a quesadilla made with just grilled chicken and cheese.  I loved that our servers took it in stride and did not give me the \"eye\" as so many others have.  I mean, why go to a Mexican place and ask for no peppers?  I go because my family loves the food, but my stomach does not.  Aunt Chilada's made me feel right at home."}
{"text":"\"THE BEST\" happy hour for Friday nights.

The chicken wings go fast since they are the best in town and TOTALLY FREE every Friday for happy hour. 

If you get there AFTER 5:30 most likely the tacos, and chicken wings will be gone."}
{"text":"Had a birthday party there. It housed our 80 really close friends and a couple more parties. A gf ordered the chicken enchiladas, which usually are dry and not so good. I tried hers and ordered my own. Fantastic food and service. Excellent atmosphere! Completely satisfied, and I'm hard person to satisfy with food. I'll be back real soon."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for our anniversary, we wanted GOOD Mexican food. Aunt Chiladas did not disappoint! Food was excellent, service was superior, everyone was friendly, and if it had not been for the Haboob that popped up and drove everyone inside, we would have enjoyed the patio and bocce as well. I would COMPLETELY recommend this to anyone. Large tables (12+) with families mixed with booths and tables - not noisy, fast service, plenty of attention and filled glasses. Being a former Valley of the Sun resident, when we come back to visit, we are coming back to Aunt Chiladas!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Wonderful strawberry margarita. Food was okay. We had the guacamole to start, it's spicy but so good. Not frozen tasting like most restaurants. The street tacos were low quality meat and kinda thrown on the plate but had an decent flavor. My husband had the fish tacos and said they were amazing!! Do not get the kids chicken fingers they are the worst but we should have known better. The picky 4 year old got the best of us!! Over all I would go back."}
{"text":"Four stars for the service. But I did not like this place. The chips and salsa were awful I had the  steak burrito and everything on the plate was just blah. I would not go back. I do want to say tho my wife liked everything about this place ( but she is weird )"}
{"text":"Don't count on the bartenders acknowledging you unless you are sitting at the bar. I watched two seats at their bar remain dirty and empty for 20 minutes.  Like they are too good to clean it. They weren't even that busy."}
{"text":"We celebrated my principal and school secretary's retirement party here. We had over 100 people and rented out the entire patio which was very nice. The servers were attentive. The cash bar was quick easy and inexpensive.the food was okay for a large buffet type of thing. I bet the food normal served inside is much better. However, they did an excellent job with a large crowd and would recommend them for that."}
{"text":"As an (inexplicably) popular Phoenix destination, I've dined here over the years and been reasonably satisfied.  Service is tolerable, speed is tolerable, ambiance is tolerable.  It's a little overpriced for the quality but I was able to swallow it.

Until tonight.  My group was seated out at a patio table which had the umbrella still on it so we were sitting in shadows.  We asked for a candle for some light- \"We're out of candles, I guess we're not doing candles on the tables anymore.\"  The guy graciously removed the umbrella from the table which helped a bit.

It was downhill from there.  Slow service on drinks, constant creepy lurking interruptions from the waiter, condescending comments during 2/3rds of the tables orders.  Snooty oblivious help from the woman who brought out our orders.  (If the people you're sending out with food can't answer simple questions with anything better than a blank stare, *MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T BE CARRYING OUT THE FOOD*)

Continually empty water glasses and slow service to the end, I left satisfied only in the knowledge that I will never patronize this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Great fajitas & tacos-very fresh and flavorful. Tortillas are excellent. Chips and salsa are ok. Great location & cute ambiance. Service was average"}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't come here nearly as much if I didn't live right down the street. In all honesty, the food is pretty mediocre. 
However, I've found a solution that works pretty well for me: get really drunk, then eat. Four stars for Prickly Pear margaritas and being able to stumble home. 
The flour tortilla chips are pretty damn good and addicting. However I've noticed a suspicious discrepancy in torilla chip ratio lately, they seem to be hiding more flimsy corn chips in with the flour. Very sneaky and lame. 
And Fideo? Yuck. Uh no pasta with my mexican food please, I'll stick with the rice. 
If anything, get drunk and enjoy the wonderful patio on a nice day. I still haven't tried their brunch yet but they had me at Chocolate Fountain."}
{"text":"A little run down from when I was there about 10 or so years ago but the food and service was very good! Margaritas ok and the $25.00 dollar Cadillac with aged Grand Mariner good but didn't quite make the $25 price in size or taste even with the nice glass to take home! Pretty slow and quiet but what isn't  in PHX in August!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the wait both times took FOREVER. The food isn't bad though."}
{"text":"My husband and I met some friends here last Friday after work. It was my first time being at the original Aunt Chiladas . I had been to the one in Tempe but didn't realize they are not affiliated?  The history and the character of this location is amazing.! From the service of our waitress, to The delicious taco bar and the personality of the chef JD , it was an overall phenomenal experience . Exceeded my expectations ! cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa! They put black olives in their salsa, which I love but he hubby hates!! Great atmosphere! Service is good and the food is decent! Two bars! One inside and one out! Huge dining area!!! Check in out!"}
{"text":"Have been here for dinner many times and love the food.  I always get a combination plate that includes rice and beans. The rice is so different and good!  Must try."}
{"text":"Fortunately they have brought back the Friday night bands, and the cougar scene seems to be trickling back. The frozen margaritas are perfect, as are the accompanying fresh chips and salsa (the taco sauce is wonderful). The service can be somewhat spotty, but it's a big place with lots going on, and food is always delivered quickly and has always been great. Really an interesting place, perhaps even the quintessential Phoenix experience."}
{"text":"Five words: Back Patio, Happy Hour, Friday

First: Back Patio. There are two patios at Aunt Chilada's. One is in the front when you walk in, with a bocce ball court and an outdoor bar. The other is through the restaurant in the back. I recommend this back patio. It's very large - on warmer days they have the misters flowing freely, and the cool strung lights at night. The trees around it make it feel somewhat secluded, and as the temperatures go down, this is the perfect spot to have a margarita or beer.

That being said: Happy Hour and Friday should really go together. During the week, Aunt Chilada's has happy hour snacks for free. Usually enchiladas, chips and salsa, etc. But on Fridays, they step it up 5 notches. The happy hour food goes on the back patio, where you can get chips, usually taco meat, beans, enchiladas, veggie tray, fruit, salsa, etc. for free. They continuously refill the free food while it is happy hour, so don't fret if the enchilada tray is empty. 

One of my favorite patios in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great experience! 
Quick, easy parking: 
Speedy, attentive, courteous, & personalized service:
Marvelous unlimited home-made chips & salsa:
Dynamic, easy-to-read, informative menu:
Wide range of tasty beverages:
Delicious entrees (steak fajitas & torta sandwich) which look appealing, taste flavorful, and reasonable in quantity:
Acceptable price to quality ratio:

Definitely a repeat!"}
{"text":"We had the nachos which were good, they were suppose to have chicken but I think we got one piece of chicken.  The beans were bad, they tasted as though they had just opened the can and poured them on the nachos.  I asked the waitress for some flour tortillas because I believe that flour tortillas tell you a lot about a Mexican restaurant especially those who claim they are authentic, homemade.  Their flour tortillas were AWFUL!!! She gave me like 3 or 4, they were all stuck to each other and these flour tortillas were not homemade.  I have bought some from the store that were way better. Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Food is good, service is good, prices are very reasonable, and its a really nice place to hang out. Great Bar area, nice traditional mexican decor inside and a terrific patio area with an outside bar. The free fried chips are awesome. 
I`ve tried quite a few things on the menu. Pollo Fundido is excellent. Seafood Enchilladas are very good. Fajitas are a bit disappointing. Good frozen Margaritas. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was really good. I absolutely LOVED their flour tortilla chips. I'm pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food, as I was raised on homemade Mexican food, but I thought this place was pretty decent. They have great customer service. The ambiance was great. Oh, and I can't forget, the margaritas were amazing!! I would love to come back to this place again, when I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Overall I loved Aunt Chiladas, good food, good drinks, great atmosphere, games, you name it. However, the service I received at the bar... not so great
We were hanging out her before our flight back to Nj. Our bartender Sarah seemed fine, she was friendly and gave us what we needed, however when we got our check- I wasn't too fond of her anymore. 
We were drinking margaritas all afternoon because they were on happy hour, she didn't explain to us that there were two different sizes- and that the larger size wasn't on special... so we were charged full price for A LOT of margaritas. It should be common courtesy to explain the specials to us instead of just serving us the more expensive one without even asking. But that's not all.... that was just mildly irritating... 
it was Mexican pizza night, so I asked for a pizza order sheet. Sarah gave me one sheet, I looked at it, it was broken down where you could choose 0-4 toppings all for an additional cost, ok no problem.. but then she takes the paper back and gives me a new sheet telling me \"oh sorry this is the new one, use this\" ok that's fine. The new sheet she hands me has just the meats as an additional cost and the rest of the toppings listed as \"complimentary\". Even better!! I thought.... so we check off a bunch of the \"free\" toppings..
Well when we get out check, we were charged for all the \"free\" toppings... turns out the first menu she gave us WAS the correct one and the toppings were not free. 
So after the margarita upcharges and the pizza upcharges, our check was around $70.... not exactly what I expected. Did she really think that I'd give her a bigger tip if she intentionally drove up the price of my check? Sorry. I think not. 
We closed out and walked around back where a much nicer, and HONEST, bartender was working. I don't know her name, she was pregnant. She was great! No problems, and she explained the happy hour sizes to us without us asking and instead of just giving us the large and charging us more..... 
I would love to give this place 5 stars. But I was SO angry after receiving my check... However I'll definitely go back there if I'm in the Phoenix area again!"}
{"text":"OMG. Worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my 50 years of existence. Here's the experience went

1. Right out of the gate...Our hostess who seated us told us the fruit and chocolate fountain were included with the meal. My girlfriend grabbed two pieces of melon and two strawberries.When our waitress did finally decide to show up 10 minutes later we both ordered a cup of Albondigas soup without rice. She made a snotty remark that we should get the bowl of soup because the cups were small. She then barked at us that if we don't order an entree that we would have to pay $8 for the four pieces of fruit. I said whoa, hold on. We are ordering entrees. She replied that a lot of people come in just for soup. All of this is going on while my girlfriend and I are still reading the menu to decide what we wanted. I want to know what other people just ordering soup has to do with us.

2. After 30 minutes the entrees arrived. I complained that it took way too long and the waitress said they had a large party and that is why the food took so long. Mind you I ordered 2 enchiladas and my girlfriend ordered a gound beef tostada and it took 30 minutes...no shit. How hard is that to make? I told her that we are just important as any other customer in the restaurant. She sent the manager over and he said the same thing. Large party sorry. I told him I don't care about the large party. Not our problem. That was it...he walked away. I looked around and the place was practically empty.

3. I ordered beans and rice with my meal. The waitress didn't even have enough courtesy to listen to me. She brought me fideo (mexican pasta) instead of rice.She also brought fideo and beans for my girlfriend who ordered her tostada ala carte.and charged us for it. When my girlfriend ordered just the tostada the snotty bitch complained that my girlfriend wasn't ordering more.

4. After trying to eat what was very poorly made food (we couldn't eat it because it was horrible) we went to pay the bill and noticed extra charges. We complained again. This time the manager did not come to talk to us. He told her to tell us the meal was comped. Since we couldn't eat that crap, that was fine with me. My girlfriend was going to taste my enchiladas and without asking one of the bussers took my plate away.

5. Finally I asked to speak with the manager and a waiter called him (Marty) and the manager turned around and yelled across the bar that he was too busy. He LITERALLY yelled it. Then he noticed me standing there and said Oh, I'm sorry. I replied no I'm sorry that you are too busy. I told him I would never return. That was the last straw.

The waitress was a snotty bitch and never checked on us once except to give us the check. We had to ask other wait staff to get our waitress more than twice. If you are smart you will not waste your time or money at Aunt Chiladas. Over rated and over priced. This place should be out of business.

Oh and the Chocolate fountain is disgusting. I've seen people pick up the fruit with their fingers and cough and sneeze in it."}
{"text":"We had breakfast there. It was wack. The beer was cold though. I guess that was the bright side to that joint. Maybe they shouldn't have their food sitting out though.  #baBOOSH"}
{"text":"Good food and margaritas, and the patio is a great place to dine al fresco. Be advised that if you are vegetarian or vegan, you're pretty well limited to the vegan fajitas, but the good news is that they are delicious!"}
{"text":"I went to Aunt Chilada's on a gorgeous 80 degree day in December, so we were able to sit outside. The patio is pleasant and plush with lots of plants, flowers, birds running around, and a fountain. As many of the other reviews said, the chips and salsa are great! Since my date and I ate so many chips, we decided to share a fajita, which was good but nothing special. The service was respectable and our water glasses were always filled. I did not drink, but I saw a few margaritas go by that looked quite tempting!! I also heard they have bands on the weekends, which I want to check out sometime. It was a great dining experience and the atmosphere on the patio was wonderful! I would definitely recommend going here on a nice day so you can sit outside."}
{"text":"Doug, the manager Doug and the bartender (actually all the bar tenders) are awesome! I got off work late and I had my heart set on going here to play open mic. Well, the kitchen closes at 10pm and they have really good food, so I called in... THEY PLACED THE ORDER AND. WAITED FOR ME! I was only about 15 minutes late. Well, they literally heated it back up for me. Obviously this is inconvenient for them. But they made it seem like it was no bigs. Love this place. Good hearted people. Great good. Amazing vibe. Come to Aunt Chiladas. Cheers mate!"}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. Makes TacoBell taste like
5star dining. 

The restaurant is Chaotic and dirty with poor quality ingredients and quite a few
service flaws."}
{"text":"I went to Aunt Chilada's at the recommendation of a friend who used to bartend there. 

When I arrived, I was immediately asked if I was meeting a party here. Nope, it's just me... I was seated and brought a menu along with flour tortilla chips (yum!) and salsa. 

I started with the cheese crisp. This thing was amazing!! It was a cross between a sauceless pizza and an open faced corn quesadilla. So good. In retrospect, I would've finished that and eaten less of everything else.

From there, I ordered the 2 combo plate: Cheese enchilada (how could I go to a place named Aunt Chilada's and not order one...) and chicken taco. The enchilada was good, and the sour cream I ordered with it had an almost whipped texture. I took one bite of the taco, and decided against it. It was a crunchy corn tortilla, the chicken was breaded and fried (crispy chicken in a taco?). 

If I went back, I'd stick to the cheese crisp and a 1 entree plate.

There is also a banquest room, and a large outdoor seating area with a bar and bocci ball court."}
{"text":"Our party of 19 ate here on December 23rd and 15 of us ended up getting food poisoning.  By far one of the worst experiences in my life especially because half of our party were children and sadly Christmas was ruined for all the family's involved in our party.  I am hoping no one else who ate there this day suffered from what our family went through but if anyone else did please know you were not alone in this matter"}
{"text":"Black olive salsa?  Um, me not likey. Chips are a variety of house fried flour and corn served in an 80's type Parquet bowl. I ordered chicken fajitas.  They were served with fideo; Mexican spaghetti that tastes like Mexican rice; guacamole,  pico, sour cream.   To me the food was bland,  but i did grow up eating TexMex.  We waited forever for our check. Server was doing as well as he could with it being a busy Monday.  Food was not impressive.  It felt  like i am in a Mexican Cracker Barrel with log chairs, rustic wood paneled walls and a non function train that should run around the top portion of.the room. I don't expect to ever go back."}
{"text":"Amazing venue for our wedding!  Michelle who does their events was absolutely wonderful!  She radiates kindness, honesty and integrity!  Their staff take pride in what they do and made our day perfect! All of our guest said they had never had such good food at a wedding before and were impressed worth the staff and venue as well!"}
{"text":"I've ridden by this place countless times on my way to and from the trails in Dreamy Draw. Always seemed pretty packed, so we stopped in for lunch to see what it was all about.

The building itself is great, old school and huge. The only other restaurants I've seen with seating areas this big are the buffets at the larger properties in Vegas. Love the padded bar and fixed stools. Good amount of TVs for sports. 

Service is awesome. Bartender was super friendly, attentive and helpful.

Drinks are great. Had a few really good margaritas, and I'm a sucker for easy to drink Mexican beers on tap. A bit pricey, but this is a tourist haven. It's expected. 

However, the food is what kills this place. I knew this was a by-the-book TexMex place going in (large boat-like plates of different combos of the same 8 ingredients smothered in sauces, cheeses and beans), but even with those low expectations, I was very unimpressed. Menu is giant, like a chain restaurant trying too hard; think Chili's meets On The Border, only executed more poorly than that. While the portions were large, what we had was bland, uninspired and unidentifiable.It truly is a feat that someone in the kitchen was able to cook every bit of taste out of our food. Flavorless beans, chicken, cheese, veg and sauces. I guess they anticipate that the resort tourists would be scared off by food with flavor, and maybe even some spiciness... 

Also, pass on the chips and salsa. The chips aren't normal chips, and have the texture of drywall, and probably taste about the same, too. The salsa is utterly flavorless and has black olives floating around in it for some reason. Ick. 

Overall, a great space with great service that is sadly producing bland, shitty food for those that apparently lack taste buds. Shame. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch around 2:00pm the place was pretty much empty. The chips and salsa was great, ask for the hot sauce it's really good. All the food tasted great. We all really love the fideo it's like a Mexican pasta it comes in place of rice, it's full of flavor. The service was pretty much nonexistent, maybe due to the time we came in. The order was taken fast, food was delivered fast and check was dropped off fast. There was no check back, no offer of more chips, and no can I get you anything else."}
{"text":"Great people, great food, great service!!!! Highly recommend! The food was absolutely amazing and the margaritas were to die for!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for awhile so last night we did.

1. We stood at the door a while before someone said anything to us. Several employees walked by.

They sat us in the back building...you go out the side threw a outdoor seating area and into another building...it smelled horrendous. A cross between mold, dog and must.

We we asked to be moved and they were happy to oblige. But it took a while to get that smell out of my nose.

We worked fajitas and they were okay nothing I would really want to go back for. We also ended up waiting for quite awhile for a service to check in on us she wasn't bad she was just either too busy to keep up with everybody or I don't know."}
{"text":"Got a few recommendations from the Hilton across the street.  The enchiladas were bland with unseasoned chunks of chicken.  Maybe I'm just used to the Mexican food we have in San Diego...  The food did come out quick and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"The main restaurant was closed for an event so we had to eat in the bar.  It was dirty and half the chairs were wobbly to the point of unsafe.  I had the beef fajitas and they were very tough.  I ate less than half.  On the bright side the staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Have never been disappointed here.  The chips and salsa are really good.  They mix home made and regular chips.  The salsa is really good and my daughter swipes all the black olives before anyone else."}
{"text":"The only thing I get here is the chicken enchiladas with spinach. The most delicious enchiladas ever! Don't like their chips and salsa though. The best place to sit for good service is the inside bar."}
{"text":"My aunt had a birthday there awhile back. They had a separate side for us to enjoy with a room for a DJ with was wonderful. The food was not good, we had appetizers and I also ordered  a chili burrito. It tasted like it was frozen food. There was also a singer on the other side in the bar and it was competing for sound..poor guy. The owner/bar tender was great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places have recommended to out of town Visitors no complaints their soft chips are great"}
{"text":"The food here is not good.  Let's just start with that.  It does have great outdoor seating though and they allow you to reserve tables for happy hour.  We often will walk down there and have a drink, grab some free food from the happy hour buffet and head home.  I never go to eat dinner or anything, but really enjoy just sitting outside with a beer."}
{"text":"Free buffet with drink purchase in the bar... spinach & chickn enchiladas were good."}
{"text":"We have been going to Scottsdale in April for the last 20 years for the Scottsdale Culinary Festival. About 10 years ago the consierge at our hotel recommended Aunt Chilada's for great Mexican food. We have been going back for lunch ever since. We fly into Phoenix, have lunch at Aunt Chilada's, then drive to Scottsdale. We always look forward to their great salsa and chips, especially the flour chips. Last year I ordered my regular taco salad and was very disappointed when it no longer came in a flour tortilla shell. My new favorites are the fish tacos and chile rellenos off of the lunch menu.
This place doesn't necessarily have the best mexican food in the country but the outdoor dining, pleasant atmosphere, and very cold beer on a hot day, always hits the spot."}
{"text":"GREAT food... Everything we got was fresh and delicious. The patio area is really cute too! Outdoor bocce court in the front"}
{"text":"Met here with friends after the Desert botanical garden and had great walk a moly great margaritas. Didn't like the flowered chips but when they replaced with corn it was all good,  had a great meal I had a chili Riano and a chicken tostada which was super good Everyone was well filled and I will be back as Arnold would say"}
{"text":"After a strong recommendation from my foodie co-worker, my husband and I tried Aunt Chilada's. I had to talk him into going, as the Yelp reviews were so mixed. This one time, I will admit that my husband was right (ha!). We were seated quickly and given shot glass-sized glasses for water(really?) and chips and salsa. The flour chips were tasty but the salsa was standard, with the exception of black olives. Yuck. We proceeded to wait for 15 minutes to have a server even approach us for drinks, with many tables being seated and served well after our arrival and before we even got a \"hello\". NOT a good first impression. Our waiter finally arrived and my husband ordered a house margarita which I was so jealous of as I rubbed my pregnant belly. He said it was \"just okay,\" and was seemingly quite watered down. He ordered ground beef nachos and I got a combination plate with a cheese enchilada and a chicken taco. 

My husband received the wrong order and had every meat imaginable on his nachos (and was later charged too much, as well). He said that the nachos were average tasting, with the chicken and ground beef being tasteless. The shredded beef that was also on there supposedly had the most flavor. My enchilada was pretty good with good taste and flavorful sauce, but the taco was horrible. The chicken was not seasoned and extremely overdone, and didn't seem to be fresh. It had a horribly unappetizing texture, as though it had been recooked in the microwave and dried out the pieces so that it was hard and stale. The refried beans were fine but the fideo was flavorless, cold, and didn't go with the meal at all. When I think of Mexican cuisine, I want some delicious rice, not noodles. Too bad they don't offer a side option. 

Although the food was not good, I would typically give any place a second chance. However, the poor service has cemented the fact that we will never go here again. Drinks were never re-filled, we weren't checked in upon, and after asking for our check and a to-go box for my husband's nachos, we had to wait another 10-15 minutes. Sadly, we had a view of the kitchen door, where we watched our server stand and joke around with co-workers during that wait. He then brought the check (which was incorrect) and a box for the table next to us but not one for us. We said forget it and left with a bad taste in our mouths (literally)."}
{"text":"This is the single worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to in my life.  

I ate here 2-3 years ago and I still tell people how freaking terrible it was.  

I was staying at the hotel (great hotel and resort in general) and my friend was starving.  Instead of grabbing a cab and heading out to Tempe I was shanghaied into eating at this abomination.  My other friend who is the nicest most mellow person I have ever met who never complains about anything, pushed his plate away after a single bite agreeing with me that this was by far the worst Mexican food he had ever tasted.

The service was tolerable but nothing special and you are seated on a nice patio, but outside of those minor triumphs this place was an unmitigated disaster of a meal.  

I swear on my deathbed I might remember how horrible my enchilada taco combo plate was and think it may have been the one regret I had in my life."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday night. There weren't many people, and we sat outside in spite of the fact that it was chilly. The busser brought two heat lamps over for us, though, which was much more comfortable, until he spilled ice water all over my wife's purse and my foot. He was very apologetic, though, and the server seemed afraid we were going to become irate.

At any rate, we ordered our food, and it was quite good. My wife & I were pleased with the vegetarian options, though the red sauce on my burrito left something to be desired, as it was quite watery. And the fried Asian noodles they serve on the side of nearly everything are a disgusting waste of food. Beyond those two issues, I enjoyed my meal very much. I tried some of my family's dishes, and they tasted good as well.

And the non-corn tortilla chips are rather like elephant ears, or pie crust in my brother-in-law's opinion, but were a unique touch. I was disappointed to find olives in the salsa, but overall we had a good time, good meal and would return on our next trip to AZ."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Food was awful, not good at all. Tried it once and probably will not come back again. I will go else where for real quality food. Service was blah. Overall, not a good experience. No thank you!"}
{"text":"Had dinner on a Monday night. They weren't real busy. We had called 4 hours earlier to get a table for 12. They were not set up for us when we arrived. The dining area was about 25% full but they had to take 15 minutes to put a table together, by the fireplace. We had to have them turn the fireplace off as it was too hot.

Drinks ordered and it took another 15 minutes to get any of them to our table.

I tried to order Huevos Rancheros which is not on the dinner menu. Other mexican restaurants will normally make this. Not Aunt Chilada's. The waiter said the chef would chew him out if he took any special order to the kitchen. Again, they were not busy and they have Huevos Rancheros on their weekend breakfast menu.

I've eaten at this restaurant before when visiting Phoenix. This was by far the worst experience of all from the service to the food and just the general attitude about us as customers."}
{"text":"Ana was a real server.  Although my grandparents did not speak english, and she did not speak spanish, she still managed to make them feel welcome. Try the shrimp pineapple and the pollo fundido. It was also such a nice environment.   Great place!"}
{"text":"Went to Aunt Chiladas for a happy hour. I cant really comment on the food other than finger food which wasnt good nor bad.  But i can comment on the salsa which I have had pleanty of.  As far as it being the best salsa in AZ that is far fetched.  It is decent if you mix the hot and mild together.  Actually it was much better than I expected.  I have a few recommendations of places with better salsa.  Much better salsa.  1.  Pedros in Glendale.  2.  The pico at comedor guadalajara.  3.  The green salsa at los dos molinos."}
{"text":"1. They may be open until 2am, but they don't serve food after 10:00 PM.  It would be nice if this were listed somewhere on Aunt Chilada's website. 

2.  Who puts black olives in their salsa? Maybe this is some sort of Tex-mex thing. But as a native southern Californian in love with Mexican food, I have never experienced such a thing.

3.  The fideo was super soggy.

4. My family went for lunch on a weekday.  There was some sort of work banquet going on in a back room.  There were possibly two or three other families eating in the other main rooms.  Our server seemed to be working hard..every time we saw her.  Unfortunately, there were times that she disappeared for way too long.  

5. Half of the orders placed had something wrong with them.  I ordered black beans and was given refried.  Every family member with a chicken dish complained that the chicken was drier than wood.  My sister ordered a salad with chicken and received one meat-free. We didn't ask for corrections, because considering how long it took for us to get any food, we would have had to wait to dinner to receive the corrected meal items.

6. The wood bench, manikin and old blanket in the entry way sorta smells like musty cat urine.  I think it is long overdue for a cleaning.

7.  I have been to this restaurant many times over the years. I was sad that this last experience was so marginal. Overall, the food was okay--worthy of three stars. The prices and quantities were good.  But the inaccurate orders and the lacking service (which I think comes from being understaffed instead of bad skills) drop this place down to a two.  I will update my review when/if I ever return.  Until then--go only if convenience dictates that this is the best place for you (you are staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak resort without a car), and go with the expectation that you will be there for a long time."}
{"text":"What a cute place!!
That is about the only positive thing about Aunt Chilada's, unfortunately.  The food is not even mediocre IT SUCKS!!  Started with the nearly inedible chips and the dressed-up-ketchup salsa all the way through dessert was downright misery!  And the service sucks too :("}
{"text":"Checked out the famous happy hour on a Friday version and also was told this was a decent pick up joint. Neither were as good as the hype. The buffet is free yea, but you better get there early to avoid food poisoning. The chaffing dishes are left open (due to long lines?) and the flies, which are all over the place, can have a field day. It was a cloudy day on Friday, but if its hot and sunny and the flies are around and the food is exposed, it all could be the perfect storm. And what is up with the tiny plates? You got people doing all kinds of balancing acts with one plate of ground beef, another with taco shells and some even trying to balance a third plate with a potato burrito I think and some fruit and broccoli. Give us bigger plates - we are adults. Tried a few tacos and they were OK. Beer prices were good at $3.25 a bottle and they had a band play later.
   This wasn''t  a pick up place either unless you like your women over 60. Lots of retirement parties on this night, but the overall crowd age was over 50. Still, can't beat drinking outdoors in nice weather, so that is a positive for sure."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are worth the trip to aunt chilada's alone. I love the flour tortillas that have neem fried instead of the harder corn tortillas you normally see. I also love how they will grill you jalapeños on the side if you request it instead of just regular pickled jalapeños from a jar like most places. Fantastic place for happy hour or dinner or Sunday brunch. Love this place."}
{"text":"Okay so we had an awesome Yelp event here tonight! I thought the service was superb! I thought the drinks were great! I thought the party favors were a hit! Just a note on the food... it was buffet style & I enjoyed all of it! I especially loved the corn tamales... they were spectacular! Cheesy, Creamy, and Corny.... just like me! LOL =) I loved the atmosphere... there was a lot of old town feel & history here! You should stop by & pay a visit. Nice going Aunt Chilada's, you know how to throw a party... real live donkey & all!"}
{"text":"First time stopping in. The atmosphere is very laid back. The food was amazing! Great portions for reasonable prices. Our bartender Madison was great! Very attentive! We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I went here for the yelp event and it was great! The venue was great and huge only problem was the parking. I love the name of this place! there was even the bar outside. I ate buffet style but there was so many chips. I would hold a big party group here and the name of this place is funny/amazing."}
{"text":"Wow, what a relief.  I am so glad to see an average Yelp rating of 3 stars.  I was worried that I was crazy because when I arrived, I read multiple \"Best of...\" awards (you know the ones), but by the time the meal was over, I was thinking, \"Best of what!?\"  I am so glad my fellow Yelpers agreed with me: this place has great atmosphere, but the food is average at best.

To their credit, I walked through an incredibly great patio, perfect for Arizona winters, on my way to the main entrance.  But it reminds me of Tortilla Factory in Scottsdale.  You don't go for the food.  You go for the patio."}
{"text":"They've added a gluten free menu. I highly recommend the chicken avocado salad. The burritos are good, servings are huge. Great salsa too. Really nice servers. I've never had the brunch but it looks good on the menu."}
{"text":"The food here was not incredibly  authentic, but was very good. The atmosphere was causal and family friendly, and the waitress was helpful and polite. They did not take reservations, which was a shame, but had lots of open space with tables. I got the carnita street tacos- HEAVEN ON A PLATE!"}
{"text":"We've seen some real authentic Mexican food before in my home town Chicago and my new home in El Paso...Aunt Chilada's is up there with all the great Mexican restaurants.  You have to stop here if visiting Phoenix....and try the chicken-spinach enchiladas with beans and fideo...yes! fideo instead of rice. Waiters and waitresses are cool and friendly.  Say hi to Sarah for me. :-)"}
{"text":"We had my moms celebration of life here, Michelle did a excellent job working within our budget and the event was wonderful and the food was good."}
{"text":"Areas of opportunity:
1. In AZ tap water makes a different
2. Waiting 20 minutes for menus, water, and chips (that never came) is not OK
3. Cleaning our own table from spilled salsa is not OK
4. Charging us for a quesadilla and not bringing it, NOT OK!!!
5. I will not be back..."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. I love the fish tacos and the creamy chipotle chicken. The only downside to the restaurant is the servers & the cleanliness... Or lack there of..if the waitress's became a little nicer and the restaurant a little cleaner..I think they would increase in ratings and business."}
{"text":"Okay, if you want some music and dancing, this is a cool place for Friday and Saturday nights.  I think Aunt Chiladas was in one of Will Ferrell's movies.  So it is great for that, the layout of the restaurant is worth seeing, but the food is mediocre (with the exception of the AMAZING flour tortilla chips and salsa).  Go for a few beers and a good sports room.  Eat the chips and salsa and enjoy that.  Like I said, dancing and a good band right in your face is pretty darn cool on the weekends.   TIP: Sunday nights is open mike night.  Bring your stupid and get up there!!  Hahhaha, see you there!"}
{"text":"This place is tourist friendly foodie restaurant. The wait is long \"over an hour\"and a lot of empty tables. Be aware and if you have children with you because of the LONG WAIT TIME.  The food is good."}
{"text":"We love getting together for dinner and margaritas here!!!  Aunt Chiladas is one of our go to spots!  Great food, good service, comfortable, relaxed atmosphere.  If you're in a rush on at dinner this is NOT the place to come but if you're out with friends and want to kick back and enjoy then this IS the place.  The food is always consistently good, the drinks are reliable.  Parking can be a challenge on weekends so plan accordingly and ride share or Uber."}
{"text":"We were invited here with some friends and the food and drinks and service were alright.They were not terrible, but not worth going back for. Just very cheesy and greasy and I am sure a fat and calorie bomb!"}
{"text":"Aunt Chiladas is awesome! The food is great especially the delicious chips and salsa! The service is superb our server Tanner was professional and courteous!! Definitely a favorite !"}
{"text":"Best tortilla chips I have had even if the salsa is half ass. The entrees are also above average and the ambiance really does give you that Mexican cantina feel."}
{"text":"I am giving Aunt Chilada's a four because the service was outstanding and the chips and salsa were good.  Not sure of our server's name (table 35 or 36 last night) she was funny and excellent.   Even sang a little song about the food for us.  The food is average at best.  Nothing noteworthy, just standard food.  The drinks were good and they had live music playing which was nice.  It is a good place to drink but I would think twice about eating there again, unless I wanted an average tasting meal."}
{"text":"Friendly service but food was just ok. Maybe an off night."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food in Phoenix, the salsa has black olives in it!
The margaritas are very good
Nice ambiance and a friendly wait staff"}
{"text":"Stayed across the street and went for a quick dinner. I was with a large group and I tried to change their minds about going here based on the Yelp reviews. Service was very fast and the food was solid. When my travel takes me back to AZ (Next summer) I will most likely stop by again ..."}
{"text":"I Love this location the patio/ outside area is nice and relaxing. If you love pineapples you have to try the stuffed one with shrimp so good."}
{"text":"Our first time and was very disappointing. We waited for almost an hour for our food. And when we said we were leaving all of the suden our food was ready. When the food finally came out, our food was cold. I couldn't even it since we waited so long I wasn't hungry no more. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Service was adequate. The bougainvillea is really pretty. Dont come for the food-bland, oily, and completely uninspired. Everything is full of cheese."}
{"text":"Oh Aunt Chiladas, a true Central Phoenix classic! We came here with some friends who were having a staycation at the Pointe Squaw Peak and had a fantastic evening! We were actually able to sit on the patio in August due to their misters, we had great service, delicious margaritas, and food! 

I went to order a house margarita but our waitress told me that the margarita shaker for $12 was actually better quality and you get two margaritas out of it (ends up being the same price as two house margs). SOLD! She was right, it was fantastic. 

I love love their chips & salsa here. I always seem to eat too many before my meal comes! For my entree, my fiance and I split the chicken + steak fajitas that come on a sizzling skillet with tortillas, guac, sour cream, rice, and beans on the side. The marinade was delicious! It is a great dish for 2. I also ordered a house salad on the side. 

All in all, we had a great experience here and would absolutely come back! They have a great Happy Hour and themed nights during the weekdays as well so be sure to check out their website for more info. It is also GREAT for groups!"}
{"text":"Best tortilla chips I've ever had. They are the perfect mixture of crunchy, soft, and flavorful. I never actually got a chance to try the food, because the chips are too good. I usually sit down, order my drink, begin eating the complimentary chips and salsa, and I can't stop eating them. Try them for yourself."}
{"text":"Angel was an excellent server, made our experience incredible!  Excellent food, tasty!  Tacos Jesus delectable. As well as the Piccadillo Enchiladas. Dessert was incredible as well!  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"The queso didn't have much flavor to me but the chips were nice and crispy.  The shrimp tacos were amazingly fresh packed with lots of flavor!  The Trouble in Paradise was delicious as well!  Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"If you want to stop for happy hour and experience a tiki hut sort of vibe this is the place. The weather mostly cooperates and their salsa and complimentary chips are great. However, their margaritas lacked one essential ingredient... Tequila!"}
{"text":"This has one of the best patios in Phoenix. If you're looking for a place to have a margarita, people watch, and enjoy awesome weather, this is the place to be. I love the food.  I personally can do without the flour tortilla chips; I'll usually dig through to get to the corn ones! The salsa rocks and I've always had good service.  A Phoenix must-visit IMHO."}
{"text":"We were in town for a graduation and happened to drive past this fun little restaurant.  We called for a reservation and walked across from the hotel where we were staying.  

It was so yummy!  The chips (a basket of flour and a basket of corn) were delicious as was the salsa, the entrees and the margaritas!  We even played bocce ball (I think that's what it was!) out on the patio afterwards.  We had a great time and the graduation dinner was a success :)  Will definitely go again the next time we are in town"}
{"text":"My experience at Aunt Chiladas was weird to say the least. Food is fine and the service is fine. Maybe we caught them on a bad night?

I wish we were able to sit on the patio because it looked fun out there! 

Note that they don't serve rice on the side here, they serve like Rice-A-Roni which REALLY caught us off guard. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. We mostly just weren't expecting it. 

Overall, I had fun with the group I was with, but it was mainly in part of us laughing about how strange our experience at Aunt Chiladas was!"}
{"text":"I like Aunt Chiladas because it's really close to home and it's a cute little joint, but the food is average and the service is below average. Now, I have only been here when it's been quite busy. I came here once on a Friday night, and I've been here twice for trivia night on Wednesdays. Today's review is specifically about trivia night.

I suck at trivia. Seriously, I'm terrible, but I go to surround myself with my awesome friends, who also suck at trivia -- just not as much! Ordering food during trivia night takes FOREVER. And the room that trivia takes place is in tiny, almost as tiny as the tables. It's really hard to eat, especially if you're with a group larger than 3. It's also quite loud. I was sitting right next to the trivia host tonight and could barely hear him. 

The menu has plenty to choose from, but I haven't ever truly enjoyed any of the dishes I've gotten here. It's not bad, but it's also not good. I will say that their tortilla chips are great though. The salsa... not so much.

I'd probably come here for the drinks, but not the food. And I'd recommend sitting outside when it cools down. Their patio is quite lovely!"}
{"text":"We hosted a family reunion/birthday party here. I live out of state and organized the entire event via phone and email. Michelle, events coordinator, was fantastic to work with.  The event was perfect, food delicious and the adult piñata was a blast. I highly recommend Aunt Chilada's. They made it all so easy!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty, service friendly but imprecise.  Margaritas not bad.  Vegetarians be sure to ask about everything because they use chicken stock in lots of things."}
{"text":"I had expected more greatness from this place. The salsa was good, service good, atmosphere ok. I was a lone diner, and they sat me back in a dark corner. I had brought a book to read while eating, but couldn't even see the pages. 
The best part of the menu was the ceviche. If a restaurant has ceviche, you know the food is good. I cannot resist raw seafood.
 The tortilla soup was ok, and the chips and salsa was above average. The chips were REALLY good actually. 
The bloody maria (tequila rather than vodka) was also average, nothing special. Heck, it was even on special and the waitress charged me full price.
With all the advertising saying this was the best mexican place around, I expected alot better."}
{"text":"What a bummer! This is our neighborhood hangout, and we've always loved the salsa and chips. We ate lunch out on the patio yesterday, and got one bowl of regular chips and one of flour chips. Then, as we read the new menus, we noticed that they are now charging $2.25 for any additional bowls of chips! And these are small bowls! My favorite part of going to ACs was the salsa and chips. Also, with a new menu you get, you guessed it, higher prices! And they eliminated our favorite lunch specials! The waitress said they are making their own chips now, instead of buying them, so, since they have to pay someone to make the chips, they can no longer just give them away in the same quantities. She said something about how so many chips were being left on the tables. I can understand raising prices. I can even understand charging for extra chips. But, I can't tolerate raising prices and charging for extra chips. At least put out a larger bowl of chips for the first batch!! This may seem petty to some, but to us it is a very big deal. We will patronize those restaurants that seem to value us as customers. Free chips are such a tradition, it's hard to have that taken away. Oh, and it was very nice out on the patio--loved (seriously) all the little birdies coming around for morsels."}
{"text":"Slow service....Mediocre canned food....skunky refried beans....bland canned tomato salsa....only place in all of Phoenix that I've had whole black olives in the salsa....still trying to digest that one (literally....!)

Eating here is not recommended....

The only saving grace was tonight's band....

Cold Shot and the Hurricanes ....better advice,  see them at the Rhythm Room ....SRO!!"}
{"text":"Met another couple here for lunch on Friday. I had called for reservations earlier and requested dog friendly patio seating. On arrival were greeted warmly by hostess, a long time employee. Addressed me by name and 'you have a doggie?'. Great service, good food. The 2 sisters met us during lunch and the mom owner family thanked us for coming. We recommend this restaurant based on great service, good food and great hospitality. All Good!"}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's does a very good job with all the Mexican restaurant standards as well as some creative dishes.
The bad reviews almost scared me away. I'm glad I went anyway."}
{"text":"If you're from the area, Aunt Chilada's feels like a home for all Phoenix natives. If you're not, everyone is welcoming and the atmosphere is great. With an extremely spacious patio filled with tvs and a bocce ball court. The food is good, the price is around a date night price, not an every night out kind of realm. I'd suggest it to anyone while the weather is still nice, because the patio is worth the trip."}
{"text":"We finally made it here after years of saying we needed to check it out. It was a beautiful night so we sat on the patio. I only wish smokers weren't allowed on this same patio but thankfully it was only one individual.

They start things off with a basket of chips and salsa. The flour tortilla chips are fantastic. I could sit and eat and entire basket of them and skip ordering an entree all together. The salsa was mild which is perfect for me. Both my husband and I had the pollo fundido. It wasn't bad but I have had it made better elsewhere. Our other diners enjoyed the chicken fajitas and the taco salad. They said their entrees were delicious. 

The service was good and the ambiance lovely. We will definitely be back for more chips and try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Every Friday night, there is live music and every single time we've been there, the band has been awesome.  It's a great atmosphere.  You can hang out inside and dance or go outside and sit down with your friends and still hear the music."}
{"text":"We went here on Sunday around 6pm.Its was practically empty we got our seats out on the patio and waited and waited for service.............finally she comes out from inside takes out drink order ok done brings it back and takes our food order we asked to start with dinner salads then proceeded to order our meals.Less then FIVE minutes later out comes our meals no salad we ask the girl where our salads were and she says I work in the kitchen I don't know where your salads are.OK excuse me...MMMMmm Forget the salad now we wanted it first not after.I bite into my Flautas YUK!!! They had to have been microwaved the meat was rock hard and the tortillas were like rubber! We complained but all we got was you don't have to pay for the salads well I guess not we never had salad!
WE have been going here for years and this our  first bad experiance and very bad it was."}
{"text":"The food gets 3 1/2 stars, the service gets 2, so I am going to give an overall 3 rating.  

I had not been to Aunt Chilada's in years and we randomly were thinking of places to eat in that area and thought why not?! I remembered the house made tortilla chips being the best ever (and they still are, and they still put regular ones underneath).  

We ordered our drinks right away (a 22 oz beer and a margarita).  It was at least 10 to 15 minutes before we got them.  One guy was actually getting up from his table and just getting their drinks from the bar (it was not very busy, it was about 2 in the afternoon, so the lunch rush was over). When the drinks came, the beer was only a 16 oz, but who cares at that point, we were just happy to have drinks.  

When we ordered lunch, I asked for a high chair for our son who was still in his stroller so he could eat as well.  They never brought the highchair and with the other things already done wrong, I just let it go, he was able to eat his quesadilla just fine (that they also charged us the full price for, not the children's - and again for $1 difference it wasn't worth the wait I knew we would have to mention it).

I ordered 2 stuffed poblano peppers.  I was served one. It was however, delicious and plenty big enough that I still brought some of it home.  

My boyfriend just ordered a carne asada burrito, which came out fine, it was nothing spectacular, but decent.  As mentioned, my poblano was very tasty and a good sized portion.  

We waited for the bill for quite some time as well.  

So overall, the food was exactly what I remembered, tasty and a good variety.  But the service was terribly slow.  We'll go back when we can just sit at the bar, it seemed a better spot to be and much faster.  I enjoy a lazy lunch at times, but the long waits and errors for a simple lunch for two was terrible."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Employees where ok. The people playing the bocce tournament where great."}
{"text":"Even though the resteraunt was empty when we were seated, the service was slow and another couple was complaining they were seated for over ten minutes and no one came to take their drink order. Food was just ok."}
{"text":"Here for Cinco de Mayo!! Place is a joke... Go somewhere else!! Made us pay a cover and there are no specials... Margaritas taste like water and service is nearly non existent... Way to rip us off due to the holiday!!!"}
{"text":"Very SLOW service for a Tuesday night with light crowd.  40 min to get served.  Typical Tex Mex food.  Nice atmosphere but doesn't measure up to the many Mexican choices in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food and the service was amazing thanks to our server angel !! Will for sure be back !"}
{"text":"I understand that this place is an old classic, but it seems more old than classic at this point.  It just feels dirty inside, the food is medium quality at very best and the service struggles.  They try hard, but it looks like the staff is on their own.  Probably my last visit unless there is a serious change."}
{"text":"I felt very at home and not in a restaurant setting, service was great, also the food was delicious. I thought this was the best Mexican food I have ever had, and thanks to Angel Dominguez, he made sure we were taken care of and had an awesome attitude."}
{"text":"Somewhere between BAD & BLAH...

describes the bland food our group had here. The setting is very nice & the margaritas are good but that's it. The food was very bland, lukewarm, just disappointing. Usually so-so Mexican food can be made more tolerable with some salsa but even the salsa here doesn't help. 

Also, if there are unruly children using the bocce ball court crashing the balls into the wooden frame like when we were there, it makes the lovely outdoor patio a much less desirable place to be.

Definitely will not go here again."}
{"text":"So I am eating my words from my review in 2010.  The dust bunnies on the ceiling are still there - I looked (minus a star).  We ordered the cheese crisp to start and it was really good.  The tortilla crust wasn't soggy at all and it did not swim in oil.  Both salsas went well with it.  I ordered the fish tacos.  The fish was not rubbery and had plenty of fresh flavor.  The plate also came with a lemon wedge and a lime wedge.  Perfect meal.  Also liked the Spanish rice much better than the fideo.  

The rest of the table ordered the quesadilla sampler and a bean burro.  Both looked pretty good, but I was too busy enjoying my tacos."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to take the family for Mexican food. The kids loved the chocolate fountain. Food is great. We had the breakfast torta and the Aunt childas omelette. Both amazing!"}
{"text":"So apparently this is one of the oldest restaurants in Phoenix. You will be struck immediately by the whimsy outdoor bar and colorful decor. The owner greeted us at the door and warmly welcomed our nine-top. 

The chips and salsa were popular among my team just not with me. My chicken burrito on the other hand absolutely crushed my hunger. It is a wet burrito with tasty beans and cheese. 

Service was on point. The atmosphere is pretty typical Mexican restaurant just larger, warmer, and slightly more upscale. I heard that the seating was up to 700 people. It was hard to believe but maybe it is true. The next time I am in Phoenix, I would love to come back. It seems like a killer spot for a night out with friends and cold margaritas."}
{"text":"We went with family who go here on a regular basis and were underwhelmed. While I see the appeal of the all you can eat Happy Hour, the rest of the experience left a lot to be desired.  If all you want is a couple of drinks and a couple of small plates of free mediocre tacos - then by all means, knock yourself out.

We wanted an actual dinner so we went to the other side of the restaurant to get a real table away from the happy hour crowd. And there we sat, with nothing but chips and salsa, for at least 25 minutes. Two different servers took orders and attended to other tables within view and not one person even acknowledged our existence. When we attempted to get their attention, we were ignored. We finally got up and left and went elsewhere.  Based on the menu options and the quality of the food at Happy Hour, I'm willing to bet there are probably a dozen other Mexican restaurants in the area that offer better food and service."}
{"text":"I will summarize my wife and I's experience with Aunt Chilada's in one word: BLAND.  It was pretty forgettable.  I will say that their flour nachos were scrumptious, and if you find yourself there, grab some.  

Our food was nothing but soggy tortillas slathered with melty cheese.  No seasoning whatsoever.  We were on vacation from New York and we had better Tex-Mex there.  I only hope we can find the real Tex-Mex or actual Latin food in this area.  

Also worth noting the wait staff was not very good.  Our hostess and waitress both served us in regular old street clothes and did not look professional at all, and their  demeanor more or less matched it.  They checked in on us only as etiquette required and disappeared as soon as we wanted something.  The only saving grace was a nice youngish waiter who helped us out even though we weren't his table.  

The rating says it all: don't settle for Aunt Chilada's,  at least not on Monday nights."}
{"text":"Love Aunt Chilada's! The food and drinks are great but the service was the best part. My bartender Lauren was the sweetest and totally adorable - plus she makes a killer mojito! Definitely sit at her bar when you check this place out."}
{"text":"Love the beautiful outdoor patio and so does my dog! The service is friendly and attentive and the fish tacos are amazing!"}
{"text":"If you like a restaurant that allows a table of 10 women celebrating a bachelorette party to yell vulgarities and profanity while you are dining then this is place for you. Evidently lots of people like this place cause it was packed. Good chips and salsa, Mediocre food. Won't be back but they won't miss us"}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada.. You bad señorita.. Here's your grade.. No bueno.. You get an F.. I drove all the way from my hood to go & visit you across town.. You treated me like a step niece that you hated ! 
Drink order took forever.. & was wrong.. No H2o.. Despite 3 , yes 3requests.. Order was wrong., took a bazillion million minutes to get.. And the waitress was not a happy girl.. Nope, Aunt Chilada she was not.. And your chips were stale too.. The cheese on top
the taco came when of all things I finally get to pay my debt to you for bad service and nibbles.. And then she forgot the credit card.. What the heck, Tia.. Was she getting her nibbles & snack on across the way with my card.. ?? Well.. Sorry , but you let me down..& it'll be a long time before I visit your casa again..."}
{"text":"Wow - what a nice surprise!  I hadn't been to Aunt Chilada's in 10 years and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience this evening.  The homemade tortillas and salsa was addictive...I could just eat this for my meal.  I enjoyed a traditional chicken burrito enchilada style with red sauce and cheese...absolutely delicious.  The beans and fideo noodles were fantastic too...so tasty!   I can't wait to go back with our furry friend and enjoy the pet friendly patio."}
{"text":"Use to come here quite often but moved farther away so haven't been here for quite awhile... had family in town and thought it would be nice to have dinner out in the patio..: the place is in a really nice setting... service was super slow, never got water, the tamale was covered in red sauce and when I mentioned it to the waitress... she just said that's how the come?! I've never had a tamale covered in sauce! Asked for an extra napkin... never got it... it just was a very poor visit! Dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Great pace for Mexican food. Homemade flour tortilla chips, with good salsa. President margaritas were so good. And my recommendation are the shrimp tacos. This place has a large outdoor seating area, and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"A Groupon brought us back to what used to be one of our go-to Mexican food places. Either our tastes have changed, or this place has really gone downhill. 

The history of this place harkens back many years & is included on the menu - fun to read. The place has a kitschy atmosphere, and a nice outside area to dine. Located in shadow of the Pointe Hilton Hotel at Squaw Peak, the restaurant still draws many visitors. The night we were there, there were many large tables of guests that appeared to be from out of the area. I know, I'm jumping to conclusions, but locals know how to pronounce \"chimichanga\", \"quesadilla\", \"machaca\" and \"chipotle\"!

The carnitas tacos were boring and generic and the chicken burritio flavorless. Meh.. Margaritas nothing special. They claim to be \"always\" voted Best Margarita by a local magazine, but I find that hard to believe. The upside: the salsa is very flavorful. Not a fan of the flour tortilla chips, though.

Years ago we used to come here for the awesome happy hour on their outside patio, which they still advertise. Reduced appetizers during the week, free buffet on Fridays.
 
I doubt we'll be back. The Valley has lots and lots of places to get authentic Mexican fare. We'll leave Aunt Chilada's basic Gringo fare to the tourists and dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Salsa and chips are great!  The entrees are hit or miss.  Service is also hit or miss.  Outside bar is a good choice."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Frozen Margarita's are the best and they do not short you on alcohol at all.  Love the chips and salsa and the best item I think is the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Happy Hour time!!!  

This review is purely based on HH.  We met up with friends on a celebratory boozing.  It was jam packed on a freakingly hot afternoon.  I order me some cold margarita.  It must be their HH itty bitty version of the drink which was decent.  Hey, my friend bought us the first round, so can't complain!

Then, I had some White Russian...nasty stuff.  Hubby was smart to chug beer instead.  The freebee food bar consisted of chips, beans, salsa, hot wings, tamales and cheese enchiladas (chafing dish of the last two was empty).  Should've ordered food instead.   I decided to forgo the fruit and veggie platter with flies feasting and buzzing around.  My son asked me to Google \"What do flies do to food?\", I decided that I don't care much for fly vomit.  Aunt Chilada's should invest in acrylic food covers!

Several round of shots came out.  The extra star is for our server's awesomeness.  I had to have some ginger ale after that and guzzled some water.  After all that I had to go to the outhouse...it was like a sauna in there!!!  

It's not a place I would go back to, if I had  the choice."}
{"text":"While my food was great,  I definately didnt enjoy the service.  We waited and waited and waited 45 mins for our food & drinks.  I felt like our waitress forgot we were there.  However she was super attentive when it was time for us to pay..."}
{"text":"Setting, food, prices, service... All of it top notch!!!  I simply love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood joint that serves disgusting food.  Sit in the bar and smell the smoke from outside.  I asked for the door to be closed and told it was not possible.  Second hand smoke in the bar.
Supposed to have live music , we left and it had not started at 7:30
The guacamole tasted worst than packaged.  The chips were mixed, some deep fried on top and the regular packaged ones on the next layer.  The chicken breast sandwich for $10.95 was a joke.
The place was packed...volume is not a sign of anything but volume.
The bar is heavy handed on price but NOT on pour.  Yuk.."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with my mother-in-law, she had the veggie fajitas, and I had a chicken burro with green enchilada sauce. we both enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"love going there on Friday happy hour nice complimentary chips and salsa etc..  Good crowd, fast service never needed to look for my server. Nice food when I have eaten there on occasion.  

Recently had lunch and love their \"Street Tacos\".  Will be back."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is good.  It is not the best food ever, but it is a great local hangout with a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"There are no words to describe how amazing Aunties is. It's hidden away like an oasis in a paradise. It has beauty, style, class and dreamy like atmosphere. A dream you never want to wake up from. The place is huge there are two outside patio and inside room where live music happens on Fridays. Beside it's natural beauty on the outside it wouldn't mean anything if it had no substance. The people are what makes this place gold. They are unique, laid back, classy (most of them) and bring a positive upbeat, mature vibe to the table. From bar tenders to guests it's a lovely way to spend my Fridays after a long week at work.
I recommend this to individuals who want to get away into a paradise but stay here on earth. To people who want to eat best nachos ever and wash it down with a ice cold beer. For a great night out look no further then Auntcheladas!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for the plus 30 crowd. Indoor and outdoor bar areas. Live music is usually very good.  I've been there about half dozen times or so and every meal was good. Lively and fun, good vibe."}
{"text":"Great service at the bar.  Good tequila selection.


Alexa was the very attractive tattooed girl helping me. Also, a helpful guy with glasses was tending bar.  They were equally helpful, however, Alexa was a much prettier woman than the guy with glasses.


-20 years restaurant industry experience"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant to visit whenever I'm in Phoenix! I've come here several times over the years and it is comforting to come back to consistently great experiences. The vibe and decor of the restaurant is what really makes this place memorable. I adore the outside patio and the bocce court! The chips and salsa are absolutely addictive and the drinks are prepared to perfection. I've never had a dish I didn't like, all of the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. I've had consistently wonderful service, they've always seemed to have a great staff on board. I can't wait for my next trip to Arizona to go back!"}
{"text":"The service was good and our waiter was really nice and helpful.

The chips were disgusting. The salsa was good though.

I ordered the bean burrito, it was not good. The beans tasted weird and so did the tortilla.

My husband order the fajitas and his tortillas tasted old and were crusty.  

Definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"My wife are in town from NY and staying across the street and found Aunt chiladas. We love Mexican food and could not have had a better experience. The service was excellent and the food was amazing. Our server KP was very personable and gave us lots of advice and suggestions for which touristy things to do (as which not to). Extremely reasonable pricing, especially the beer!! If I'm ever back in Arizona we're definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Chips here are great! Nice outdoor area that is dog friendly.  Food is good..not great."}
{"text":"I really wish I could put 4.5 stars, because I usually don't put five as a rule, reserving that for mind blowing experiences. But, it's earned a special star, and it's a good 4 anyway.  My husband and I eat here regularly, and often stay up very late.  This is only place open late at night, anyway near us.  That deserves a star.
Most places close at 9.  If you call to order take out at 8:45, some won't even take your order.  I'm from Chicago, even in the suburbs, there are usually places open during the week, at least until ten. 
The food here is, for the most part, outstanding, gourmet, & good Mexican, but it's a fusion.  Familiar with good Mexican food, like I said, from Chicago, even visiting/eating in Central Mexico, such as in Michogan, it has only a slight similar quality.  But, unlike most \"anemic,\" and Americanized Southwest food, this stuff is full of flavors.
They have as an appetizer, what I called 'flautas,\" they call them, taquitos? Those are awesome, probably the closest to authentic Mexican street food.  
The salsas, the ones you pour over certain dishes, and the generous portion they give you of fresh salsa is delicious, again, Americanized, but not \"weak,\" as with most Southwestern food I've tasted.
The seafood enchiladas and quesadillas are amazing, packed, stuffed with seafood, scallops, shrimp, etc. and do not taste fishy. 
This place is on the pricey side, yes, but they give you a lot of food.  I would say you could split it, and you could, but the food is so good, you are going to want to pig out, seriously, I love to share my food, but when I eat here, it's mine!
The flan is really, really good.  The people are kind and nice so far.  This is a favorite restaurant for me.
I did eat here once for breakfast/brunch, and that was very delicious."}
{"text":"Nice place in the middle of a residential area making it a quaint local spot.
Really enjoyed the Pacifico on tap ($4.25/glass) and the Nachos gustivo pequeno ($9.00 for small).
A bit pricey but still a fun place."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Huge portions. Will definitely be back. Thanks for making us feel so at home while on vacation."}
{"text":"I went to this place several times for drinks, lunch and happy hours and I think it is more for the atmosphere.  Their decor is fun and their Happy Hour is nice because they have a free chips / salsa bar available.  

Last night, I ordered a Blue Moon I think it was 22oz for 6.50 and a Sour Cream Chicken Enchilada for about 6.95 (off of the a la carte menu)  and sat watching 2 baseball games with my hubby.  There were a few people at first around 5pm and the service was pretty fast, but as more and more groups started showing up the service was slower because it was just the two of us and the waitress had to deal with about 2 / 3 groups of 4 - 8.

I totally understand being busy, especially when our food came out fairly quick in the beginning, but the meal itself was ok.  I think it is a fun place to be and their chips and salsa are good, but for food I think you will just be stuck with an ok."}
{"text":"I am giving the Margarita's 4 stars. The food on the other hand gets 2. A pitcher of marg with a tequila upgrade (Hornitos) cost &28.00. It is the best marg I have found in Phoenix and it is cheap in comparison. The happy hour is great, they have free food that is actually better than entree you might order. The patio is usually full of people having a good time. If you want a marg and a superb outdoor seating arrangement this is your spot. If you want food food with that marg try Los Dos Molino's."}
{"text":"Over the top service, ambiance and food! It is causal with a southwestern flair. If you have a chance, ask the 4th generation? owner/manager about the HISTORY of this Iconic Phoenix Mexi-eatery. 
The bar is comfortable (we ate at the bar 1st time in-we were there for an event...-) Had the Jesus Tacos-- great stuff!
Had to come back and try more of the menu-- and it just so happened that Hatch Green were in season, and Gr Chile stew was the featured item that evening-- my personal favorite. I also bought some roasted/peeled Hatch for take -home--
I would recommend this place if you have out of towners and want to show them a GREAT example of Arizona style mexi-cuisine. Family-Owned and operated AGAIN, Thank goodness!"}
{"text":"Great patio. Food average. Pricey.
Many better options for Mexican food in the area. Tortilla soup not good. Salsa not great. Overall unforgettable food and experience."}
{"text":"Quintessential  and kitschy old-school Arizona. The food, while old-school Mexican, is actually decent and props for offering fideo.  I'm willing to overlook the fact that it can smell like cats or my grandma's place because of the building's pretty interesting history."}
{"text":"I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to eat anything here, since I am a vegan. I was pleasantly surprised to see 'vegan tacos' on the menu. The tacos don't have a description on the menu, but they are 2 crisp lettuce cups filled with sauteed vegetables. The tacos come with a bowl of black beans. It was very satisfying. I was told by our waiter that the tortilla chips are fried in oil, not lard, but other reviewers had mentioned they are fried in lard. Not sure who's right on that one. We were will a group of 8 and we had great service for our dinner."}
{"text":"This place not only met, but way exceeded my expectations. The location was beautifully decorated, everything was exceptionally clean, the food was clean, fresh, and delicious. There was enough that I had a whole meal to take home. Also, the staff was very friendly! I stopped in with my family while on a staycation and we all had a wonderful time. As a Phoenix area resident, I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Average

Recently, I attended a retirement party at Aunt Chilada's Mexican Restaurant for a co-worker. The restaurant is large with  indoor and outdoor seating and the bar provides nice dining options to accommodate large parties.   

Aunt Chiladas offers a large variety of Mexican/Tex-Mex options. We had the taco bar, tosadas, chicken enchiladas, rice, beans, salad, and chips and salsa. Everything was hot and fresh but to be honest there was nothing too exciting about their dishes. The food and service were just average. Although, I would have to say that the chips and salsa were really tasty.

Maybe, I caught Aunt Chimadas on an off day. Prehaps, I will visit again and give it another try."}
{"text":"We went to the restraunt day before and we closed to a private party. Came here after the nascar race and the decoration we cool very welcoming and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Located in a fairly residential area, Aunt Chiladas has a nice outdoor    seating section along with a bar and bocce ball court.  The menu includes pretty standard items, tacos, burritos, enchilada's as well as some other specialties.

The chips that everyone mentions were OK. They are more of a puffy chip vs. the crisp thin chip you normally see with salsa.

For apps the table shared large tortillas covered with melted cheese, kind 
of like a Mexican pizza and some guacamole.  They were tasty.

For entree, I got the sour cream chicken enchiladas.  The plate was huge.  2 large enchiladas covered in sauce and served with refried beans and rice.  They were good, but the chicken was a bit dry.  Others said the seafood enchiladas were delicious but I didn't taste them.  The chicken in chipolte sauce was good.

If I had the choice, probably wouldn't be my choice for for a meal."}
{"text":"In Mexico we say \"no hay mejor salsa que buen apetito\". Roughly translated- there is no better sauce than a good appetite.  Well, we came with a huge appetite and the food was STILL terrible...I have to believe that the guys in the kitchen must be embarrassed to tell their friends and family they serve this mush under the pretense of Mexican food.  I imagine they write home to their mothers saying they work at Taco Bell to save what remaining dignity they have left.    Hyperbole?  nope.com This place was terrible.  At least the drinks were strong. Too bad they aren't strong enough to kill the taste of the food... The place claims to have award winning salsa and chips but it must be one of those participation awards they give everyone? because even that was terrible.  The wait staff was nice... So at least there is that..."}
{"text":"I attended a graduation party this weekend at this place and it was lacking a lot of things. The  service was very slow and only one waiter for a buffet of thirty people, which left a lot to be desired. The best thing I thought was the Grilled Salmon and Fideos oh and cant forget the fried ice cream the was excellent! The chocolate fountain was a huge disappointment, there weren't enough strawberries and all that was left were cantaloupes and honeydews and when we asked for more they said they did not have anymore strawberries...that's not good service of planning for a prearranged party. Would not be my on my list of favorites to return to anytime soon"}
{"text":"Four stars for the fun atmosphere and friendly bartender. :)  My friend and I never ended up ordering food, just a few drinks.  There was actually almost nobody there when we arrived mid-afternoon, but the outdoor seating area was so cool, and the bartender so warm and nice to chat with, that before we knew it we'd been there several hours.  It was a Saturday, so it picked up a lot as the night went on.  The thing I liked best was that there were several \"locals\" (of all ages) who go there all the time, so it was kind of like everybody knew everybody, and even if they didn't know you yet, you were still a friend.  Sitting at the bar, people were having conversations with everyone around them, beside them, across from them, wherever...whether they knew each other or not.  It was that kind of vibe.  A lot of fun, but in a chill way.  I'd like to come back with a bigger group of friends, this would be the perfect next-stop after spending a day sipping cocktails on the lazy river at the resort.  And I see now from other reviews that I'll have to give the chips and salsa a try when I come back.  So yes, then I guess I will need to come back.  There, it's settled.  I will be back. :)"}
{"text":"I have been visiting this restaurant for many years and have been present for the changing of the menu almost 4 times! I remember the food being better, so I have been upset with some of the changes, however, I will still make this a once a week stop.  The chips and salsa are AWARD WINNING and for GOOD REASON.  Ask for the flour chips only.  They are the reason to visit this restaurant.  Their chicken quesadilla is amazing and their food is decent, but definitely go for the chips & salsa.  You'll pay a bit much for the food, but it is definitely worth it.  Just remember to come for dinner early if you are visiting on a Wednesday or a Friday or there's only street parking available.  The bar gets to be pretty packed on these nights."}
{"text":"An awesome time always. Madison made me feel so welcome. I love this patio. Especially when the temp is in the 80's. Living the life."}
{"text":"Food was excellent but the service is OUTSTANDING. After they sat us, we waited for a server for about fifteen minutes (I think because they were busy). So, I popped inside to enquire about the wait. Almost immediately, the manager and sever came to our table, and while apologizing profusely, offered to buy us an appetizer to make up for the wait. They were unbelievably kind and cheerful and we will absolutely be back. We got the stuffed pineapple app and the Jesus tacos - both of which were delicious. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"This is a place where we end up coming when we cannot think of anywhere else... Carlos was our server this time and he took good care of us. Hubby recently found the jalapeño fajitas and they are tasty and spicy, I had the carnitas fajitas, which are a really good meat meal, but very far from what I consider 'carnitas'."}
{"text":"Great place to have dinner outdoors! The atmosphere was great for a Friday night. The food was excellent and well portioned. Not the usual fill a massive plate with \"OK\" food and hope that you are so full that you forget how medicore it was, but truly good food. The place had two seperate parties going on and service did not suffer one bit. The table next to us was a party of self important jerks, but the manager came over and handled them with class! We will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the margaritas, and chips and salsa are awesome. Besides this, I really love atmosphere. The outdoor bar and bocce ball court create a cool and inviting feeling."}
{"text":"Service was. 4-5 they were awesome! Even came it to sing to my son for his birthday. 
The food is good too. I personally like a lot more spice. But it was good and came out really fast."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The frozen margs are probably the best I have ever had (strong and not sugary). A little pricy (my taco salad was $13). Con queso was a joke though (melted cheddar that got grainy). I love the old/eclectic lool of the place though. Old railroad ties, neat looking outside patio."}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere is really great, especially the patio when its not too hot outside. The bocce court is a plus as well. I've been here to watch sports events as well as to hang out with friends on the patio; Aunt Chiladas is good for both! They have a wide variety of beers as well as really great margaritas. I've never been disappointed with the food, although the service has been a little slow at times. I'm not sure of the exact schedule, but they also sometimes have a free food buffet outside!"}
{"text":"This is a fun spot! The house margaritas are good, and the guacamole is delicious! I'm a taco fan, and their beef tacos can be just want my frazzled mind thinks about following a really tough day. I love that the patio is incredibly dog friendly! I bring Edie here often, and they give us a bowl of water for her every time we sit at a table. The servers are very friendly and attentive. The patio is excellent, with a bocce court, outdoor bar, and sweet view of Piestewa Peak! My friends and I frequent this neighborhood joint regularly; the bonus is I can almost justify chewing down on their awesome chips and salsa with the walk there and back!"}
{"text":"If only more restaurants could be like Aunt Chilada's. I'm happy that I have been able to visit several times and look forward to many more visits in the future!

First of all, this place is oozing with history. Did you know that long before Arizona was even a state, this establishment used to be a brothel? Yes, a brothel! Well now, it's of course the furthest thing from a brothel but you can still feel the history living in the walls and parts of the restaurant feel like stepping into a different decade all together.

Second of all, the environment. If there's a restaurant that screams party, this is it and I'm talking about a party for all ages. Whether you're visiting with family and looking for a lively establishment with plenty of patio seating, fun games and hearty food, or you're out with friends eager to share some laughs over margaritas, live music and trivia night, this restaurant's got your covered. This is the ideal restaurant for large parties, private parties and more. They have two very large patios with two outdoor bars, a huge indoor bar area, a spacious main dining room and a more private dining room in the back (that happens to be the original building that housed the brothel!) 

Third, let's talk about the activities. This restaurant knows how to keep their guests entertained! They have live music, trivia nights, bocce ball tournaments, chocolate fountains on Sundays, and special events including a fiesta bash on Cinco de Mayo...just to name a few. 

Fourth and finally, the food. The food is solid Americanized Mexican food. The Nachos are hefty, the pollo Fundido is cheesy & creamy and the quesadillas are a good greasy (the kind you want when eating a quesadilla). This food is exactly what I would expect and hope for when visiting Aunt Chilada's. It's the perfect type of food for this family-friendly, fiesta inspired establishment. 

PS - did you know that these fine folks also happen to own Rustlers Rooste...that awesome cowboy establishment in Tempe complete with a live bull, slide and two stepping? Yes, these folks know how to have fun!"}
{"text":"Meet my cousins from out of town here for lunch with our families. Fajitas were amazing. We took a table for about 7 hours catching up and the staff was great. The ping pong tables were an added bonus for the kids."}
{"text":"Great food!  The wait staff was awesome.  Tiffany was very helpful and so friendly.   The pineapple and shrimp stuffed pineapple was out of this world the flavors were spot on.   The seafood enchiladas were also amazing.  The fresh chips and salsa were outstanding.   The atmosphere was great with outdoor seating   Not to loud was comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"My business requires me to travel very frequently. I always try to find local establishments in the cities I visit that have the best food, atmosphere, and staff. Aunt Chilada's is, by far, one of the most amazing places that I have had the pleasure to visit. The food is excellent, of course. - starting with the house made flour tortilla chips! But, the staff here sets the bar high above any other place in AZ. I highly, highly recommend stopping in for dinner and then an evening on the patio.

Shout out to Sarah, Kimmie, Jenny, and Tina! These ladies are the best. Thank you so much for everything! 

Yelp needs to add more stars for this place! It's at least an 11."}
{"text":"Chips were great, enchiladas were great, and the ladies loved the margaritas! It's got a fun atmosphere and excellent service, will definitely go again! It is a little hard to find tucked behind the hilton and some apartments."}
{"text":"Aunt Chiladas hosted the latest Yelp event and what an event it was. The food was excellent. i was especially partial to the tamales...ate several. the chips and salsa at each table were excellent as well. the margaritas from the bar were nice and sweet/salty, just the right ratio. 

we'll definitely check them out again for their regular menu!"}
{"text":"This is a good option for decent Mexican food. I really like the reference as to how the local park and street \"Dreamy Draw\" gets its name. It seems there used to be a mine nearby that contain mercury and the miners would return from their shift a little woozy and in a dream like state, thus the name.
They have a nice outside patio to take advantage on warm days. I thought the food was ok, but others felt it was too bland."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and service. The guacamole was very fresh and not overly filled with tomatoes or onion. It had a nice round avocado flavor. The chicken tortilla soup is broth based and for $0.75 the amount of avocado served was fantastic. My main entree was the Seafood Enchiladas which were excellent! Both flour and corn chips were served w the salsa. Overall an excellent experience at a super price."}
{"text":"I would give a negative star if I could. Service was horrible. Worst service ever Sunday afternoon, almost no one in the place.The bartender sat us and gave us the menu. My husband and I sat by the bar area (inside) and almost 15 minutes in the place and we didn't get even a glass of water or a simple acknowledgment we were at the place.  There was no initiative to help the only waiter available. 
When you're busy you might get away with a little delay that but when there are only 5 tables (including ours) and one person working and the rest doing nothing there is no excuse. 
That was our second time going to this place and with over 1000 Mexicans restaurants in Phoenix and this kind of bad service there is no reason to come back ever"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat here in the valley! Great tasting Mexican food! This place has a very homey authentic feel to it. 

I used to come here once a week for my business meetings with Mona Vie. The place has a lot of room and is great for large parties. Our group of people always have a great time here. The staff are very friendly and pay close attention to your requests. I would definitely call for a reservation if you plan to have a group larger than 4 or 5 people. This place can getting a little busy during the usually dinner rush. Just a word of advise for you.  

Last time I ate here I tried the chicken enchiladas they were amazing! I had a Margarita also very good. 

I definitely recommend visiting this place if you're looking for a great Mexican food themed restaurant."}
{"text":"We ate here last night. The scenery is authentic food was great. Service was exceptional. Had pan lank pepper which was fantastic and so were the seafood enchiladas. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I thought I was going to really impress some friends when they discovered the highly touted \"famous\" chocolate fountain feature of our surprise Sunday brunch. 

Allow me to help manage YOUR expectations, so you're not as disappointed as I was: Yes, there is a chocolate fountain and it is included with your $8-13 brunch entree; but, buy your own(probably identical) model at Wal-mart for $40 and save yourself the heartache of a disappointing meal. 

Granted, we came for the \"famous\" chocolate fountain but we were prepared to enjoy breakfast first! Another disappointment. 

I had the breakfast burrito and could only stomach the beans. The potatoes tasted like they'd been in the freezer too long. The eggs in my burrito were chewy not \"lightly\" scrambled in the slightest.  The machaca had decent flavor but it was further ruined by the enchilada sauce that tasted straight from a generic can!

One of my guests had pancakes. Sadly, these were neither light nor fluffy, instead they were chewy and tough just like my eggs.

 \"The myriad of accompaniments you can serve with the chocolate fountain are only limited by your imagination\" in theory, but at Aunt Chilada's this past Sunday, your choices were dry chunks of cantaloupe, flavorless honeydew, pineapple cubes, (shall we say \"aged\") marshmallows, and the unimaginative standby: strawberries. Oh! And, crispy lady fingers. 

Full disclosure: I did not tell our server how much I hated my burrito or the pancakes and she DID ask how everything tasted. 

Truthfully: I was weary from the disappointment. It's one thing to send back an entree but to say everything was unsatisfactory?! I just won't recommend it or plan to return."}
{"text":"Yet another fabulous Yelp event held at this locale. Great food.....and I am not a Mexican food lover at all....but again the food was very good. The atmosphere is authentic Mexican....a Bocce court right next to the walkway....fantastic patio for our yelp event....good live music....and there was even a \"Hell's Kitchen\" celebrity chef serving up shrimp in a grille pineapple. 

Yelp done it's usual prize giveaways....which are always fun....there was fiesta theme for this event and there was even a \"Adult\" penyata which I don't think anyone was able to break open....LOL!!!! I found out they even do a free buffet during happy hour Monday-Friday 4:30pm until 6:30pm.....that's awesome. So while I don't drink or really like Mexican food.....I highly recommend this location for it's authentic feel and great patio to sit under the stars and Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Look elsewhere, would be my advice.

First of all, the much heralded chips and salsa were half-chips and half-tortilla bowls. Not a fan of that. And though it was nice to have a bowl of hot salsa and another one of milder, the mild one had olives in it instead of just being a good salsa fresca.

The combination platter was good, but I forgot to tell them I wanted black beans and rice instead of refried beans and those noodle things (fideo?). My fault for not telling them, but it would be nice to be asked, when it is an option on the menu.

Which brings me to my third point, the service was pretty bad. Guy at my table asked for a second beer, never got it. Salt was delivered on the glass of a margharita even when it was requested not to be. It took forever for them to even take our order.

The best thing is that their outdoor patio is really nice, when the weather is good, especially."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times for team trivia nights nothing has ever impressed me. The service has always been a little slow. Which I understand is due in large part to trivia. Still, you have a standard that you hope they adhere to.

The food has always been mediocre. Not actively bad just...disappointing. The chips and salsa are complimentary and I believe they're homemade, but there's something about the chips, they're flaky or something? Not my cup of tea.

I've had the fajita burrito which was disappointing. The rice and beans were blah. Like I said, nothing about this place was offensive it was just not good. I'm sure I'll be back but it won't be my choice. 

I liked the bar. Attentive bartender, decent selection, average prices."}
{"text":"Completely obsessed with this place! It's my favorite! The flour tortilla chips are amazing! The drinks are strong which is a blessing with how much drinks cost these days and they even made me something personal that was not on the menu! The staff is so sweet and friendly! It's a hidden gem with a great atmosphere and not everyone knows about it so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and I've been here and tasted much of what Phoenix has to offer for Mexican food, but this hands down is the best. The food was excellent and was the service. The food is made fresh !! I don't even eat guacamole but I will eat theirs. All of the food was delicious!!'"}
{"text":"Great Chips and Salsa (especially the flour chips).  The meals aren't the most exciting.  But you don't come here for cutting edge reimaginations, you come here for the old school feel and reliable menu.  The Sunday brunch comes with a chocolate fountain for goodness sakes (a fad that should have died a merciful death about ten years ago).  Everything here is tasty, full fatty and will taste better if you drown it in the salsa.  The happy hour is generally packed and it's nice to see a place that refuses to change with the times."}
{"text":"The way I ended up coming to this joint is far from typical.  Matter of fact, it's so far from typical that most of my friends questioned my insanity for even showing up on a random school night during twilight.  That said, it's really a good story but I shall save that for another time.

Not only is it tucked away in a very cool / scenic part of Scottsdale, but the layout is vast, expansive and impressive.

The patio has personality.  This is important when one lives in a place where outside dining is preferable for eight months out of the year.

The help / service were impeccable and everything I tried was tasty and affordable.  If you can get behind the culture and history of born & bred Phoenix family stories, this is one not to be missed.

I'll be back without question!"}
{"text":"AZ icon at its best. 

The place itself is amazing, the owners and staff are freakin cool. The food is always great even if you go for the happy hour only!

If you can check this place out and bring 1 or 17 of your buddies,.,,"}
{"text":"Enjoy it here and regularly get good service. Have enjoyed a large variety of menu items over the years. Great meal for after a long day at the pool."}
{"text":"Staying down the road at the Pointe, some girlfriends and I decided to venture down for Dinner Friday night around 7 pm. A wait at the hostess stand, while having several employees/servers etc. walk past us without acknowledging us or anything got annoying after several minutes..Was ready to go find a table ourselves when finally a server came and took us to a table in the dining room. 

I had the Avacado Salad after my server recommended it..which was interesting! It was dressed with a pinapple sauce which had a little kick to it, however it would have been better if the salad wasn't swimming in the sauce!  

It was ok, but not as impressive as I expected it to be.."}
{"text":"I actually ate at Aunt Chilada's twice yesterday and have eaten there quite often over the last year.  Lunch was good with both the food and the service being done right.  Went back last night because it was a beautiful night and we wanted to sit on the patio.  Initially the hostess was not very accommodating but reversed track and sat us on the patio.  Chips and a bottle of water showed up pretty quickly but unfortunately no glasses.  We sat there for about 10 minutes without seeing anyone else.  I have been in the food service business for years so I am pretty forgiving so this was not a big deal.  What was a big deal was that they were apparently having a function for a girls softball team and while the parents were inside their girls were on the patio \"playing\".  12 - 14 of them yelling and screaming and running around.  While they do have a bocce court on the patio, its not a playground although this was not the first time we have seen children using it as such.  It was the first time there were so many and so loud.  Had we been served a little faster it might not have been so annoying but with nothing to do but sit there and listen to all the noise we decided to leave.  As we got up the waiter hurried over and asked if everything was OK.  We explained we had come for dinner and the noise was too much.  To his credit he asked if he could give us a gift certificate which was nice but didn't mean much as we had made a special trip to enjoy a nice dinner at a nice restaurant.  If we wanted to be around of obnoxious kids on a playground we would have chosen Chucky Cheese or Peter Piper.  Probably won't be returning any time soon as it is a drive for us and not knowing what to expect (nice restaurant or kids day out) its probably not worth the effort.

In regards to the girls softball team, the parents of the Hotshots should be ashamed of themselves.  I coached travel ball for 15 years from 10U through 18 Gold.  My daughter is a coach for one of the premier high school programs here in AZ.  Never would one of my teams been this obnoxious and rude.  The Hotshots have been around a long time and have been a premier program in AZ for a long time.  If any of the people who are running this program happen to read this, you may want to tell your coaches that as long as your team is wearing its name on their shirts they should act with some class.  When my daughters played in college, the first thing they were told was you represent the school in all you do.  We told our players the same thing and that is why all of my seniors received scholarships to play at the collegiate level.  They could play and they were respectful and had class.  There is more to being an athlete than just what happens on the field.  This team was an embarrassment to your program."}
{"text":"Probably some of the Mexican food I have ever had. Not only was the food amazing but so was the service and drinks. Even with a full house our food arrived quickly and our server was very attentive. I love the fact that they have flour and corn tortilla chips. I had the fish tacos and they were absolutely the best, even better than the fish tacos I've had in Mexico. Fish was not dry and they were full of flavor. My husband had the fajitas and they were also very well made and flavorful. My kids actually ate the refried beans, and they very rarely eat refried beans when we go out. This is going to be my new go to place when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place for a large party the staff was completely professional everything was right on time and everyone had a fantastic day great job to all who helped her grandmother celebrate her one hundredth birthday"}
{"text":"I'm giving four stars because I love to drink and Aunt Chilada's is one of my favorite places to drink. The food is OK, not good but not bad (I'm from Southern California so my standards for Mexican food are very high and sadly the food here doesn't cut it enough for that fifth star)

But the place is so cool that I would bring anyone here despite the fact that I could have better food elsewhere. Every time I come here in fact, it seems like I discover yet another dinning room that I didn't know existed. You have THREE bars to choose from, my personal favorite being the outdoor bar by the bocce ball court. It has a cool tropical feel that almost makes me feel like I'm at a resort bar (the resort bar where all the drunks hang out)

The servers are always friendly and the crowd that hangs out at that bar are always a good time. It's just a fun place to hang out and people watch. I love to come here and get my drink on.

The bonus for me is that I live pretty close so as long as I don't ever stumble on to 16th street into oncoming traffic, I could probably walk home."}
{"text":"I had a business lunch here recently and we had a wonderful time. The portions here are pretty big so we were both fine with ordering one item each a la carte. She had a tostada; I had a bean burrito. It was just the right amount. And their chips are delicious. It was quiet enough that we could have a conversation at normal volume and the staff was friendly and attentive without being over bearing."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. The chips and salsa are fantastic. The restaurant is very Mexico. You feel like you're south of the border. The service is excellent. I will come back here next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's is an amazing Phoenix experience! Always a great time with yummy hand shaken margaritas and bottomless yummy chips and salsa.  Best of all the service is great, especially from Nadia the hostess with the mostest!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a wedding. Parking was adequate though I kind of thought there would be more space given the size of the venue. 

Service was good. My friends who were getting married got a nice mexican buffet set up with a open bar. As you would've figured, we all got wasted and ate a bunch of food which was pretty delicious. The decor was pretty nice but unfortunately it got a little dirty since the only time the marrying couple had was during the summer to get married and it turned out that it was going to sprinkle a little bit preceeding a heavy dust storm. Dust got everywhere since it was an outside venue and since it's Phoenix during the summer, you can imagine the heat though since it was afternoon, it wasn't entirely as bad as if it were during noonish. 

The wedding procession was really nice. I arrived fashionably late but just in time for bar open and proceeded to drink heavily. They had rented the venue until about close time and before kitchen closed, I was hungry again because I'm a fat ass and ordered another enchilada meal which came with rice and beans. It was pretty delicious. Pricing was decent. 

All in all, a good time. Outside of the venue area, in the bar and band area, people were drinking and listening to live music. I guess this place gets pretty packed with people during the weekend."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here since the yelp event last year. The chips and salsa are to die for and it it took everything in me not to eat all of the, since I call myself being \"good\". I did order the shrimp tacos (sans the tortilla) which were delicious and the service was great. I will definitely come back again to see how things are during happy hour and heck just for the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"The service staff are very friendly and seem to really hustle.  However, they are handicapped by the food preparation people who do a poor job.  The ingredients listed on menus are not necessarily the ingredients used in preparing the meal.  The cooks should read the menus to understand what the alert customer expects to receive.  It doesn't always happen.  And get rid of flour chips with salsa.  Corn chips are always better and certainly more traditional."}
{"text":"My friend Katy and I walked into Aunt Chilada's restaurant At Squaw Peak on 6/28/2014 to have a awesome dinner. The place had a few parties going on, but as usual it seemed under staffed. So my friend and I sat down and we were given chips and salsa and a bottle of water. About 5-10 minutes later a family came in with small children and after about 5 more minutes or so all of sudden a waiter comes out and looked me right in the eye and went to the other table and took their order. Turned around and went back in to the kitchen. Of course this pissed me off. We got up and hostess saw me I explained what happen she said it was her fault. That did not make it OK. The waiter should have said something to us and didn't. So we left Aunt Chilada's in discuss and went down the road to Ajo Al's for a awesome meal and great service.."}
{"text":"I had my wedding reception here last April 7,  2018. The Banquetta hall is an absolutely beautiful place to hold your small & intimate event or gathering. The food was great, the staff were helpful & even the space was perfect for our 35 guests. Our families & friends can't stop talking about how wonderful the place is, they were really impressed. Me & my husband would like to thank Michelle for being so helpful & friendly. She was able to get us in with only a month's of notice. She made our wedding reception as easy & simple as possible & she was always available for any questions & concerns. And for the 2 bartenders, sorry I didn't get your names guys but just wanted to extend our thank you, you were fast & very much attentive. Overall, I love the place, great atmosphere & definitely will come back for more. To anyone looking for a unique mexican restaurant Aunt Chilada's Sqaw Peak is highly recommended.. Good job everyone! kudos!!!"}
{"text":"Location is very interesting, and the outdoor seating area is awesome. However; the food and service is subpar. I've been here a handful of times with others (not my first choice) and I am never impressed. 
This place could be so much better if the food quality was just improved a bit, and service got a notch upwards."}
{"text":"My husband decided to take us out for lunch and he picked Aunt Chiladas. The decor is so cute right when you walk in, very cheerful. We went for lunch so it was quieter. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Now the best part....the chips! They were delicious, some of the best chips I've ever tasted. They weren't greasy or over-salted, but so good. I had the machaca taco salad which wasn't served in a taco shell so took away some of the guilt from eating all those chips. It had a scoop of their guacamole in it which was also delicious and creamy. My husband and son had the beef and cheese enchiladas which were served in a delicious red sauce. The regular side is a pasta called fideo, but they opted for the traditional rice and beans. I loved the food, the atmosphere and the service was good too. Definitely coming again."}
{"text":"Thank you for all you did in helping us celebrate our mothers life here. We couldn't have asked for a better staff, location and food. They were very compassionate and kind and helped make a difficult day run smooth! From the bottom of my heart I want to thank you all."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times on the company tab because it's a fun atmosphere for out-of-town guests. The drinks are good, but the food is meh. Out of the 3 visits, the only thing I remember liking is the soup. Oh, and the flour chips are unique and pretty good. I guess I'll go back for a free meal, but wouldn't consider seeking it out on my own."}
{"text":"Chingalingas are my go-to and are yummy (I request no sauce).  Lots of different options here - all good.  Ever had flour tortilla chips and salsa?  They're a nice change of pace.  Prices are reasonable and service is good.  My orders are always correct.  Best to go for lunch or off peak times - happy hours are really crowded here."}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's combines festive decor and loud Mariachi music with pretty standard Mexican fare. The entrees were large and reasonably priced. I did enjoy my smoked pork chinalinga and the choice of salsas -- verde or roja in mild, medium or hot.. But still, the pluses aren't enough to drive out of your way for a visit. 

Another note: it did seem like the place to go if you are into drinking a lot (which I am not), so keep that in mind if you're looking more for a place to bring the kiddies or your 80-year-old aunt Rose."}
{"text":"Attitude from the hostess
Olives in the salsa
Drinks not refilled!
Food took 30 minutes to come out on a slow night.
Server neglected us the entire time
We asked for the manager.. after waiting 10 minutes we decided to just pay and leave
Another 10 minutes for our check to come back. Still, manager never showed up

I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my two sons.  The last time i visited was over 18 years ago (I don't get to Phoenix all that often).  The outside patio was great, especially for a group from the frozen north who don't sit outside to eat in December.  The menu was adequate, with a good selection for lunch.  Chips and salsa were interesting, mild.  Food was well prepared and portions generous for the price paid.  Service was good.  Overall, a good, but not outstanding experience."}
{"text":"So I only doc it one star because there was only one Vegan Entree but...... I got the vegan fajitas and my goodness they were delicious and perfect! The fajitas were fresh sautéed onion, peppers, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots along with Guacamole , black beans and rice ! It was the ideal Mexican food! My husband got the red chili burrito and inhaled it within 5 minutes a Chipotle sized burrito!
The atmosphere was really great for our friends surprise party."}
{"text":"We went there this past weekend.  There are always private parties going on during weekends, so be prepared to wait to get seated.  Once we got seated, we were right in the middle of traffic, which was not very pleasant.  My husband ordered a chimichanga, which he was not impressed with.  I ordered the fish tacos, which were really good.  We do love their salsa and chips.  

In the past we used to come to Aunt Chiladas frequently.  The atmosphere is fun and laid back.  We felt like something had changed this past trip, aside from the menu.  We didn't get that warm fuzzy feeling we used to get while visiting.  I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Well, got off to a bad start.  We were told that the wait would be 30 minutes, was closer to and hour and fifteen.  We were shuttled from the Arizona Grand so leaving wasn't a good option for us.

Finally we were seated, two of the staff recommend the spiced pork.  I did not think much of it, but everyone I was with seemed to enjoy their meals and the portions were ample.  I wish I would have ordered something else."}
{"text":"I had the machada enchiladas and it was excellent and a decent price I believe like 10 for two enchiladas with beans and rice (no fideo for me). My wife had the beef tamales which were good but too spicy for her liking. What I loved the most was the service. I'm speaking for me and my wife as part of this review but we also had my three kids my father in law and his wife,my brother in law and wife and two kids so we had a huge party and no one was disappointed. They brought our food out all at one time in a timely manner and we're all very kind. Our server was Cameron and he didn't miss a beat. The treasure chest they have for the kids was a added bonus and even though it wasn't immaculate toys in it, it was a kind gesture and the kids loved it. Great job Aunt chiladas."}
{"text":"Well, this place is certainly the answer to the hokey tourist trap with marginally edible food, innit?

I'll give em credit for the 'Pancho's on anabolic steroids' thematics, the patio is very comfortable, and as night falls on Spring, there is almost no better place to have a Dos XX or Pacifico.  Its lervely and shaded and filled with mostly professionals hitting on their secretaries, which is pretty amusing to casually observe.  

As the US National Drinking Circuit Holiday, 'Cinco de Mayo' (eh, que?) approaches, I guess this would be a relevant time to inform of their festival, which consumes their parking lot and is actually less of a tool collection than most other forced holiday festivals.  Entry last year was about $10 with booths for drinks and food.  I didn't hate it, got fairly leathered, and left feeling it was money well spent.  

If you must visit Aunt Chilada's North, I'd hold off on the food and stick to the cocktails."}
{"text":"It was 5th meet up for the The Breakfast Club UYE and this time Aunt Chilada's was picked. We sat out on the patio, thought why not while the weather was still ok.  Aunt Chilada's has a farm fresh breakfast menu you can order from, but they also let you order lunch if that's your thing. Another plus, they accepted reservations for breakfast. That made things so much nicer. We were a party of 10, so any time I can get a reservation in, its helpful.

One of the things I noticed was the salsa had slices olives in it, that's interesting, went well with the chips though!

With our breakfast we also were able to have items from the chocolate fondue fountain, and you be believe I had some chocolate covered strawberries, pineapple, lady fingers, marshmallows, oh and more strawberries, and this was before I even ordered breakfast! haha

I have to say service was a little slow, but there was a couple of big party's at tables, who would have thought on a sat morning, this was the spot, there was even 2 parties  for Monica, that other Monica must have been cool to pick this spot haha.

I ordered the egg burrito, past few breakfast clubs I have been to a breakfast burrito or 2 have been ordered so I have just been craving it! This burrito had scrambled eggs, cheese, potatoes (my top 3 favorite things in a breakfast burrito) and I added chicken to it and asked if they could throw in some jalapenos in it for me!  I wasn't expecting much other than a breakfast burrito, but when it came out I was shocked, it was a huge burrito, and had home styled potatoes, refried beans and the burrito was covered in melted cheese. I was in heaven!  I topped the burrito with salsa and cut into it! Omg it was delish! The jalapenos were fresh and perfect! This was a good breakfast burrito!

If you hadn't thought of Anut Chiladas for breakfast, you should and go give them a try! The Farm Fresh Menu has plenty to choose from. And I have to say I did see the yogurt and fruit dish, and omg it was the best looking one I have seen, fresh layered fruit, just beautiful in color, topped with yogurt and granola, it looked amazing.

Again thank you to everyone who attended The Breakfast Club!! It's always a pleasure sharing a meal with you guys!"}
{"text":"Went for early dinner tonight (Friday, June 3rd 2016) - got there around 5:00 p.m.  Was seated quickly.  Service was good.  My dinner partner had the fish tacos (1 fish and 1 shrimp) - enjoyed both but would choose the shrimp only next time.  I had the fajitas - mixture of chicken and steak - very disappointed...so much so that I only took one bite of a piece of chicken and one bite of a piece of steak and told the waitress to take the meal away.  The chicken tasted like a baked / microwaved chicken breast that was then sliced and put atop some vegetables (no green peppers at all).  The steak was slices of a lower end cut of beef - cooked rare as there was blood oozing from the slices.  No grill marks, not seasoning, bland taste and very poor presentation.  I ate the condiments (guacamole, salsa, sour cream beans - still could not figure out what the ramen noodle type stuff was).  The tortillas were tough and stuck together - severed in aluminum foil.  The chips and salsa - which is complimentary for each table - was so/so....a mixture of chips with some being what one would expect (salty, crisp, not greasy) and others that were very thick, soft and buttery / greasy tasting.  Overall it was a poor experience for me and I would not return.  Shame - just moved into the neighborhood and it's only a couple blocks from my home.  Note:  they did remove the fajitas from the bill."}
{"text":"Suggested by a dear friend...it did not disappoint. We were seated right at our reservation time. Great menu. Excellent drinks. Food was really good, served hot and huge portions! Shrimp tacos were soooo good! 
Live band...\"Hillbilly Deluxe\" (I think?) was playing a great mix of music that we hung around and listened to after dinner. 
Fun place."}
{"text":"We decided to have Easter Brunch this year here after seeing a segment about the Restaurant on the News..
When we first arrived the place was rather empty, but they decided that our table was in the back, waaayyyy in the back in an empty dining room the farthest spot from the Buffet. 
We asked to be seated closer, and were told numerous times that all the tables were reserved...
Finally we were moved to a table closer to the action and was greeted by a very nice waitress..
The food was very good however we felt a bit over priced due to the Holiday... We will not be back for a Holiday Meal, but will visit again..."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food. Love the chips--they make both flour and corn tortillas chips. I know the locals like margaritas on the rocks but this place has the worlds best frozen margaritas. My favorite entrees is the chicken chalupas, but the spinach enchiladas are also excellent. This is a family business and the food is the best. Also has a huge bar business, so the place gets super busy, but great food and great fun."}
{"text":"We went here for my 28th birthday. We had a reservation for 18. We eat out often so are aware of numerous different restaurants, type of food, prices etc. We decided to reserve a table here knowing the facility was large and could accommodate us. Unfortunately the food was TERRIBLE, my kids who eat just about anything didn't want to eat, I don't blame them... I ordered chipotle chicken which was far from chipotle it was a nacho cheese sauce, with almonds in it and man was it TERRIBLE, the corn tortillas I requested split the second you tried to put anything in them, the beans and rice were beyond bad... my son got chicken tenders and fries that we're cold, my husband who ordered nachos was told there was chicken on them, and requested no jalapeños and when they came out had beef and diced jalapeños. The prices are WAY over priced. I paid $50 for my daughter and I to share a meal, two kids meals and nachos. I am very disappointed I wasted my birthday dinner here and am embarrassed I even brought 17 people along with me. Didn't get a happy birthday or anything of that sort either. Everybody I asked in my party about their meals said the same thing, we left majority of the food there, it was that bad..... sucks I have to take the time to write a review like that but something has got to change we will continue going to our normal Mexican restaurant that actually deserves our business. Such a shame, learn from our mistake, don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Some pointers:

(01) The fried flour tortilla chips & salsa are pretty addictive.  Beware because you might find yourself accepting 1-3 baskets of them and not realize just how much you've consumed before your entree arrives.
(02) The service is on the slower side, but the staff is accommodating and kind.  Given that we were there on a night with several large parties, Aunt Chilada's threw in a free dessert for the table to share. 
(03) Don't expect to find many healthy options.  The best word I would  use to describe my tamale + cheese enchilada plate is SMOTHERED.  I haven't had that much cheese in a loooooong time. (Totally not complaining).

This may not be the best place to keep a new year's resolution, but it is a good place to gather with a group over a typical Mexican meal.  Everyone will find something they like here."}
{"text":"Came from Cali to visit my sister and she has always raved about Aunt Chiladas. Based on her comments we decided to go for dinner. The food was great I give them 5 stars, up until our waitress asked to close out our bill so she could leave because she wasn't feeling well and someone else would help us out. I understand having to go home because someone isn't feeling well. But to have customers sit for 30 minutes with not one waiter/waitress  to come by and check on you is HORRIBLE customer service."}
{"text":"The margaritas are wonderful as are the chips and salsa.  The rest of the food was okay, not great.  The service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Bailee did an amazing job serving me and my friends we felt very welcome and the street tacos are amazing definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is always a good spot.   Very family friendly.   Food is delicous and the drinks are good.  My family likes to come here especially since there's so many of us.  Live music ...at least every time we've been here"}
{"text":"Placed a to go order earlier tonight and when I got to my hotel room no tortillas for my fajitas and no salad dressing for my salad.  Everyone was friendly, food was great but it is frustrating when you don't get the service you should at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Good food, great service. 

My wife and daughters all give the food a three. I give it a strong four. It's a matter of do you like the taste.

Everyone gives the service a big thumbs up.the fajitas are good quality steak cooked medium rare."}
{"text":"When the Chris Parker Project plays, Aunt Chilada's is a pretty good time, but the food is just so-so. They use fideo and beans as regular sides, but you can sub other sides with no charge.

Our menu:
Spinach enchiladas
Chicken tacos
Chicken enchilada
Fideo
Rice
Refried beans
House margarita
Margarita w/Tres Generaciones and Grand Marnier
Chips + salsa

Spinach enchiladas were mushy and flavorless - probably frozen spinach and too much cheese. Chicken enchiladas were so-so, a little heavy on the sauce.

Tacos and chips were great - flaky, made fresh, good eats. The salsas were both pretty tasty - one chunky and one smooth and spicy.

Both margaritas were pretty good and not expensive. Sounds like Aunt Chilada's is good for sitting at the bar, drinking, and eating chips while you listen to the band. Go elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Just went for dinner and had a good meal. But then some jerk named Steve kicked us off the boche ball to set up a piñata. He was extremely rude and even the staff when I asked for a manger knew exactly who I was talking about. Very amateur staff."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this meal. The chips and salsa were delicious. We split the fajitas. It was plenty of food! And so delicious. The service was great too!"}
{"text":"Great time here. Had the Street Tacos that were delicious. Stayed a bit after dinner for drinks and Sarah took the best care of us. Will return again."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix on vacation and decided to check this restaurant out for a late dinner. The location is great, it's very close to the Arizona Grand Resort. The ambiance of the restaurant is very lovely and not too fancy. We went around 8:30 and string lights were hung outside giving the restaurant a classy look. When we got to the hostess she said it was going to be a 30 minute wait, but we only waited about 5 minutes! Chips and salsa, along with the menus, were handed out very quick. Our waitress was very polite and kind! She said if we didn't like something, we could return it for something else (wow)!!! Being from Texas, NOTHING beats Tex Mex so this place was more of a miss for me. I ordered chicken tacos, and they were not bad! The beans and rice had a wonderful spice to them. I would recommend this to anyone in the area for a quick, but nice meal."}
{"text":"Two patios, one with a complimentary taco buffet on Fridays starting at 4 Pm. The outside bar has been removed since I was last there. I'm guessing that's to accomodate live bands. Mark Mulligan (\"Mexico Mark\") was playing wthe last time I went. He's awesome! I asked the bartender for the \"best margarita you have ever made\" and got a $7 margarita that couldn't have had any tequila in it because I felt absolutely nothing. Hence- the clothes stayed on that night and Mark did all the entertaining."}
{"text":"A friend of mine was staying at the Hilton next door and wanted to meet up for drinks and appetizers.  He suggested this place.  The name sounded cool, so I agreed and we met up on the patio.  After browsing the menu and discussing it with our server, we decided to order:

The Chips & Salsa were average, nothing special.  The Cheese Crisp was pretty good.  The Nachos were very good as well....they heap the toppings on it as you can see in the pictures above.  Of course, I had to try an Enchilada....how could I come to a place named Aunt Chilada's and not have one?!  The Cheese Enchilada I ordered was very good, above average.  Our server was very attentive and made sure our glasses remained full.  

We dined on the patio around happy hour on a Wed evening, so it was full of business people after work.  The vibe was very fun and the weather perfect.

{"text":"Love love love Madison the bartender!!! She is so sweet, super fast, and just over all lovely! We saw a customer get cranky with her and she handled it so well with a smile on her face. I am impressed! She knew the customers by name - made me want to come back more often! Seriously, highly recommend- and sit at the bar so you meet the amazing Madison!"}
{"text":"Nothing here that we did not like. We ate on the outside patio which was fantastic. There were six of us and every dish we had was well prepared and made us want to go back and try a different dish some other time.  We were there after the main lunch hour, took a long time eating and visiting. We never felt rushed and would like to have the same waitress anywhere we go out to eat"}
{"text":"The food here is very good!  The chips and salsa that come out at the start of the meal are great. The chips are a combination of two different kinds and the better ones are on the top of the bowl! 

I like the shrimp fajitas. The portion is very big so this meal is always bagged and brought home for the next day.  

Our server most recently was Angel, and he was excellent! 

The only issue I have is it seems a little overpriced for what it is but that comes with the territory of being by so many hotels. This is a true staple of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's, you are like an old best friend.. I may lose touch with you from time to time, but when we meet again, things are the same and you are there to make me happy.

Not a flour chip kinda girl...I dig for the old school chips. 
Your patio is cozy and where I want to be on a beautiful AZ day.
Don't ever change your fun Sunday brunch. 

see you soon!"}
{"text":"I came here after an awesome scrub down and massage at the spa in our hotel.  It was highly recommended by Coryn in the spa.  For starters we ordered guacamole which was fresh, full of flavor and chopped pico de gallo.  This was a great first impression. They also came with corn and melt in your mouth flour tortilla chips. BEST EVER!!  They were so damn good that I asked for a to-go bag. They were also a perfect match for the spinach queso dip. 

As if I had any room in my stomach for anything else the pineapple shrimp came out in a half of grilled pineapple. It was basically shrimp fajitas with pineapples sans the tortillas.  I took it to go and can't wait to devour the leftovers.  If you're in the area come give this spot a visit."}
{"text":"Just ate at Aunt Chilada's and it was very tasty. Some people commented that they didn't like the noodles (fideo) with the beans but that was my favorite part! I didn't really care for them alone, but mixed in with the beans it was delicious! 

I ordered number 7 (cheese enchilada + green corn tamale) which was good, albeit pretty standard and my mom got the chicken tortilla soup which she said she would definitely get again. And I'd have to agree with the other yelpers- the chips and salsa are FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"I give this place one star, begrudgingly. The only good thing about this place was the ambiance and the service at the bar. I am appalled by the service we had at the table. I have never been treated so badly. We had a party of 6, and we chose a table on the patio. The patio was really cool and full of party goers, mostly large groups of people. We sat for about an hour and a half without a server, so we got our drinks from the bar.  No big deal.Finally we decided we wanted some food, so a member of our group flagged down a waitress. Big mistake! The server, Cindy, was the WORST! She was so rude. She explained that no one knew whose table ours was, so no one waited on us. My sister tried to order and she snapped at her, \"I am waiting until everyone is ready to order!\" I suggested maybe we should order from the bar and then she snapped at me, \"You cannot order from the bar! You have to order from me.\" We ordered our food and, after several eye rolls, Cindy left our table. I seriously should have talked to a manager because she was so rude to our party. She continually rolled her eyes when we ordered drinks. The food came and it was awful. I ordered the shrimp tacos. They were completely dry and almost inedible.  I will never go back to this establishment. I cannot believe the treatment we received. This woman should not be in the service industry. I would think, in this economy, there are plenty if servers who would have wanted to wait on a party like ours. We spent $200 at table, not even counting the drinks we got at the bar. We are all upper middle class people; there was no reason Cindy would have thought we would not have tipped her well. I always give servers the benefit of the doubt; I was a server for 10 years, so I understand they have bad days. But this behavior was inexcusable and shocking. Cindy was the rudest server I have EVER had. I cannot even explain it in words. It wasn't what she said, it was the condescending tone, eye rolling, and abrupt responses."}
{"text":"This was a tough call for me. I could have just as easily and with valid reason given it three stars or, for completely different reasons, five stars. So I decided to hedge my bets and go with four.

Here's why: the food is average at best, but the ambiance is outstanding and the happy hour is superb. 

In terms of straight up Mexican cuisine, this place doesn't even approach what some other nearby spots have to offer. But, their indoor/outdoor patios are always a good time, they have great live music, and a happy hour with free munchies to boot. 

Cherry on top: their chips are awesome. They cook them in house and bring them out for free with your drink order."}
{"text":"Every time I have come to Aunt Chilada's I've had a great time along with some delicious Mexican food. I've tried their fajitas, enchiladas, quesadilla, torta, taquitos, and even the fired ice cream (don't typically get dessert at Mexican restaurants) and all have been very good. For what it's worth, I once went with a friend who doesn't like Mexican and she said Aunt Chilada's had one of the best burgers she's ever had. I can't vouch for that though. I recently tried the El Pollo Fundito and it was awesome. Probably about 2000 calories, but awesome.

This place is huge! Lots of indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor patio is my favorite on a beautiful spring evening. Great happy hour. A perfect place for group events. Live music on Friday nights. Trivia on Wednesday nights. Bocce Ball outside. Friendly staff each and every visit. Nice view of Piestewa Peak!

I really don't get some of the negative reviews of this place. Each of my dozen or so visits to Aunt Chilada's have been very positive and I will continue to return."}
{"text":"I love Aunt Chilada's!! Ive been going here for years with my family! the chingalingas are my FAVORITE meal!"}
{"text":"Best. Chips. Ever.  It makes me sad when I reach the bottom of the bowl and get the boring tortilla chips.

Fabulous margaritas.  You never feel like they make them properly until you've had 3.

Outdoor dining is awesome.  I really enjoy the outdoor bar.  Comfy and fun.

Shrimp tacos are to DIE for.  Perfect amount of food (seriously...you need more than two?  Chew your food.  Your pants will fit better.), well-seasoned, and presented with great sides (big fan of the rice).

Seating has never been a problem any time I've gone.  The place is HUGE.  It gets a bit loud on live music nights, but that's really to be expected.  You shouldn't eat here if you want a cozy, quiet, dimly lit corner booth with privacy.  It's a family restaurant.  

Big fun to be had!"}
{"text":"get irene's wrap with a side of chips and salsa! absolutely delicious and very fresh. i order this every time"}
{"text":"Visiting from ca, it is excellent for casual dining. very nice server. Wife had the shrimpand scallop enchiladas with verde sauce and a plus. I stole half. I had polbana chiles with beef and jalapeno crem cheese sauce and it also very good. Generous portions great spicy salsa with cumin and pico de gallo with olives was different."}
{"text":"Ugh! Mixed review, we loved the beautiful outdoor area but the food was mediocre. I ended up with a small, dark, frizzy dark hair in my plate. Not cool! The waitress was awesome and deducted the charge from the bill. My son thought it wasn't a big deal and encouraged me to see it on the bright side, it's protein! Not sure but I likely will try other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Met several friends (group of 20) at this place. Haven't been here in 8 years and besides the patio, it looks like they haven't spent a dime to upgrade this place inside. Chairs were wobbling, tables look old, etc. No problems with the workers, the service was excellent, however, the food is average at best. I had street taco's and my wife had chicken encilada's. My meal was acceptable. My wife thought the chicken encilada's were the worst she's had ever. Big chunks of chicken and didn't care for the rice and beans. I tried hers and she was correct. Salsa is just ok and didn't get the room temperature water bottles on the table. Probably won't go back to eat. The outside and the area around is very nice. It's pretty sad when food on the west side gets a better rating than this place."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for a group meetup.  The restaurant was very good when it came to reserving and setting up our large table.  We enjoyed being in the company of others.  That said, the food was sorely lacking.

Their chips and salsa are supposedly \"award winning\".  In all fairness, the mild salsa was unique.  It had a wide range of ingredients in it and was  tasty.  The spicy salsa was indeed spicy but there was nothing about it to make it stand out from other Mexican restaurant salsas.  The chips were unusual.  Some had the consistency of a deep fried pie crust.  In other words, they were very flaky.  Yet others were like chips found in other restaurants.

For my drink, I ordered a frozen mango margarita with salt.  The mango flavoring was faint and there was very little salt on the glass.

For dinner, I had a combo plate --- one chile relleno and one chicken enchilada.    The dish came with refried beans and \"fideos\" (noodles with a meat sauce).  The chile relleno was the worst one I've ever had.  It held together very poorly.  For example, when I was less than halfway through it, I cut off a piece with my fork and out came the entire remaining chile!  What was left was the batter and the jack cheese!  The chicken enchilada was generous with the chicken portion but pretty forgettable.  The fideos were certainly a unique touch and pleasantly flavored.

The restaurant was very good when it came to accomodating those in our group who were vegetarians.  They were willing to substitute sides that had meat in them for a vegetable side dish.

Service was friendly, prompt and helpful---no complaints there.  That said, I certainly won't go back when I'm in AZ.  Without going into too much information, the whole meal left me with a bad case of indigestion.

There is certainly much, much better Mexican food to be had in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Great service, great margaritas but so-so food. Don't get the street tacos. The meat tasted like canned/processed meat."}
{"text":"I've gone to Aunt Chiladas a few times for team trivia (I love team trivia, and this place is more convenient for my friends) on wednesday nights. Randy, the host, is great: funny with generally good diction and pronunciation. His personality and the easy parking are what keep me coming back. 

The tables are small, so it gets a little cramped. The waitresses are nice, but they don't come around often. I get that it gets busy, but it's not THAT busy. The food is perfectly average, definitely more expensive than its worth. I usually get the seafood quesadilla, although the jalapeño steak fajitas are also pretty good. I will say I like their chips though. They're not for everyone, but they are for me!"}
{"text":"***  IT DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR****

Dirty outside chairs, everything is sticky, light bulbs haven't been changed in years.

The place sucks.  Cheap food, cheap service.

I wish I took a picture or the corn tortilla chip that they served us with 2 mold spore colonies living on it.

UTTERLY DISGUSTING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thanks Manager for comping nothing at all and not even being apologetic about it.
HORRIBLE RESTAURANT MANAGER.

THAT's why you're getting this horrible review.

OH NOT TO MENTION THAT I HAD EXPLOSIVE DIAHRREA (no joke) FOR 3 DAYS
People throwing up exerywhere, hell on earth

FOOD POISONING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     YOU ARE SOOOOOOO LUCKY I AM NOT SUING YOU JOKES FOR A RESTAURANT - GOD YOU GUYS SUCK

VERY Unprofessional.  A joke for a Mexican restaurant considering Chicago has 100 Mexican restaurants 1000 times better then you.

The bartender was a bitch too with attitude.

DO NOT WASTE A SINGLE PENNY ON THIS CRAPPY RESTAURANT - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY

Quality has gone down the tubes

DO NOT EVER EVER COME HERE - GO TO A GOOD RESTAURANT"}
{"text":"jumping up and down, flailing my arms and shouting is probably the only way to get served here. we counted three servers that walked by three times and nobody cared to take our order or ask if we were served. we walked out hungry without being served and in desperate need of a cocktail. this place might be good, but our service experience will keep us away, forever!"}
{"text":"This place has changed a lot!

The addition of the outside, tiki-esque bar and boche ball give this place a much more relaxed feel.

I came here for my very last Breakfast Club UYE. We came specifically because the chocolate fountain is included w/ brunch. Quite honestly, I couldve done w/out it. A bit too sweet, but the fruit was good.

Our large group was seated on the patio, thankfully, while the patio weather was still bareable. Our waitress was a bit slow, which was puzzling considering we were one of 3 tables in the entire place. She did a good job keeping all of our checks straight though.

They have a good number of selections on their brunch menu. I chose the Mexican eggs benedict over the traditional. This one comes w/ chicken instead of Canadian bacon. It was really good, though Id go for the traditional next time due to the dryness of the chicken. The hollendaise was seasoned nicely though, and the eggs poached perfectly.

Id definitely recommend this for a brunch spot, especially if you have a major sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's has a great happy hour. They have it all for happy hour.... Music, healthy drinks, cut veggies and trays of something melted with cheese... I rarely eat the appetizers. By the time i get to them, they have been mangled by the customers. I'm happy with the big trays of fresh cut veggies. The indoor is nice, patio is fantastic. I LOVE meeting a bunch of friends here for happy hour. 

My dinner experiences have been OK, but not great. Service is usually slow. Food is adequate, but not exceptional. Still, ya gotta love a place where you can crowd 15 of your friends on the patio, mark off a bit of territory with a couple balloons, and have a great time for a couple hours."}
{"text":"I wanted to dislike this place. Hokey decor and ubiquitous gringos that come with any american-mexican joint; but maybe it was that I had come in with a huge (15+) group of people and was in generally a good mood from straight chilling on the next-door Hilton's lazy river that framed it positively.

Big restaurant is big: no problem seating everyone, huge outdoor patio, chips and salsa constantly flowing.

Had a Corona light and said to hell with counting calories tonight - it's time for Pollo Fundido, something filled with chicken and jalapeno cream cheese that there is no way you can finish in one sitting.

Came away sated and generally happy with our servers and the copious amounts of beef/chicken/cheese/tortillas/more cheese that everyone at our tables got quickly and pretty tastily. Just get rice instead of fideo with your entree.

Good for what it presents itself to be."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst food ever. Quality is poor not sure if they taste there own food. Drinks are super sweet and hardly any alcohol for the price. Bartenders cant make a drink right if there lives depended on it."}
{"text":"Ehhh - pretty much lukewarm feelings for Aunt Chilada's. Have been here 2x since moving in mid-2010 and most recently on Cinco de Mayo 2013.

Sat on patio area and literally waited about 10 min for some menus. Our server took our order and then overlooked (2x) our drink orders. Finally got our drinks after 15 more minutes. 

Honestly felt that the entire dining experience was \"locate-and-chase-the-server-down\" game. :( Food was decent (only ate chips and bean dip).

Best part of experience? Finally getting the damn check to end the cat-n-mouse game and the cute ducks waddling in from their pond. :)"}
{"text":"I sat at the outdoor bar under a straw rooftop and the March breeze cooled down the Phoenix 90-degree March heat and I truly felt like I was in Hawaii. The margaritas were S-T-R-O-N-G and the crowd was lively and fun!"}
{"text":"So dissatisfied we went to Denny's afterwards.  Sour cream and lime extra charge for your tacos?  Not going to eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm giving Aunt Chilada's a 3. Its ok. The service is ok. 

We went here this past weekend with a group of about 25 people. They sat us at 3 different tables. We asked our server if each table could have its own tab, so it would be easier for us and them to figure out at the end....they said no. Lovely. Luckily there was an atm in the bar area so we were able to pull out cash. 

The food came out faster then expected with such a large group. Mine was decent, though I ordered a cheese enchilada and they gave me chicken and never came back to ask how our food was :( BUT I also ordered a green corn tamale AND a beef taco (Leave me alone, I worked all day and was hungry as all hell) Those were both way super tasty. 

I do have big beef with their chips. They suck. Who wants flaky not so crispy chips for dipping in salsa...not me. I want my chips crispy, thin and crunchy thank you very much. 

The margaritas were good, they got me sauced. 

I wouldn't ask to go back, but if someone suggested going, I wouldn't put up a stink. Its ok."}
{"text":"The food was good but not spectacular. The atmosphere and service was great. I love the bocce ball court is great. Fun to play while enjoying a cervesa. I'm very willing to give this place a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's had me at the complimentary chips and salsa. The chips are tasty, made out of flour. Then there's the blended margaritas. They have the perfect kick. The food was also delicious. Can't get enough of the cheese. I like that some dishes serve fideo as the side instead of rice. The only bummer: I haven't been able to try the flan. They always seem to be out when I'm there."}
{"text":"Attended a yelp event here tonight with my boyfriend.....never been here before. The food was excellent and it was served buffet style. Had beef tacos, taquitos, tamales, chicken wings....followed by fried ice cream, sopapillas and flan. All of the food was wonderful, tasty and packed with flavor. Enjoyed all of this on the outside patio.
Will come back again."}
{"text":"We visited Aunt Chiladas patio because we wanted to bring dogs.  We were welcomed so nicely!  They have a whole area dedicated just to dogs so you are sitting with other dog friendly people that come.  This is such a great place to sit and relax and have lunch.  The food is fantastic.  We are vegetarians and they added Vegan fajitas to their menu.  They were fantastic!"}
{"text":"This was the best dining experience that I have had in forever. Our server Angel was amazing....Great customer service- fast and efficient, on top of drink refills, split the check with no hassle ect.  Food was delicious. Loved learning about the history of the restaurant and the area."}
{"text":"Have gone to this famous restaurant for years but this last visit was horrific; the bean burrito was filled with bean soup - all tortilla and no beans to speak of and the beef tacos tasted like chlorine. The side of peas (and whatever) was disgusting.  The only saving grace was the waitress was very nice.  P.S. Management dismissed our pleas and were too busy to care.  Won't be returning and won't be recommending."}
{"text":"This place has taken a huge dive. Yet another great place down the drain. Why? Probably can't make money paying people 12 bucks to wash dishes. So you cut back on the ingredients. Ride the workers you have harder and wait for the place to crumble. I am not sure who made the menu but if they went to culinary school they must have barely passed.

We were seated in a basically empty dinning room. But do they seat us near the beautiful fire? Nope by the open door letting in the cold. Table was broken too. My wife kept banging her knees on the part that is supposed to be locked up until you want a round table. 

You are given a huge bowl is weird looking nastiness. My wife is allergic to gluten. So she takes a bit before I tell her to stop. They have turned flour tortillas into this weird looking sopapilla type item with no sugar or cinnamon or taste. You get to add tasteless salsa too!  We were told the corn chips are hidden underneath. Why? Heck if I know. When you find them they are straight from the bag. 

I get the street tacos with machacca.  I do not know if they run all the meat through the same wood chipper or what. I am used to machacca being shredded. What I got was ground like beef and full of bad fatty meat. No taste there either. By the time I get to the third and wondering why I am bothering the corn tortilla has become so soaked with grease that it fell apart. That made not eating the third one easy.

I gave them 2 for the pretty building. If you like pretty buildings and lost your taste buds in a horrible accident you are going to love this place. The rest of you.  AVOID!

WARNING the next day I noticed my brand new shirt and pants had been ruined. They looked like they got bleach stained. I used the bathroom here and I think they bleached the counters but don't wipe clean. I lost 100 bucks in clothing. By far the WORST experience ever."}
{"text":"I always have a great time at Aunt Chilada's.  My latest and favorite thing to order is the El Pollo Fundito.  It's so cheesy, meaty and saucy!  I've also tried the quesadilla, torta and the fajitas before and all are great choices.  

This place has great decor such as a nice patio and an outdoor bar outside for the perfect spring nights.  It has Bocce Ball, a band on the weekends, and good staff.  The service is usually good, with the exception of one rude waitress we had.  I took my mom here when she visited and we had a blast.  We drank, ate and danced to the band.    

I also threw a surprise birthday party here for my fiance, Paul.  We reserved a part of the back patio and it turned out perfect!  It just so happens there was a very fun band playing that same night.  

I will be back to Aunt Chilada's for some grub and drinks and I recommend you try it too!"}
{"text":"Yep. Still sucks.

Went their recently for a friend's birthday. Didn't want to but it was for one of my oldest friends and I didn't want to disappoint her. 

I only ordered drinks and had some chips and salsa. Drinks were good but the chips and salsa weren't great. The server seemed annoyed I wasn't ordering food, but do you blame me with my past experiences? I had a taste of my friend's cheese enchilada and vegan black beans the staff is so proud of. Not impressed.

Yelpers please keep in mind that some of the 5 star reviews you see posted for Aunt Chiladas quite possibly may be an employee. How do I know this? Because I got a message from an employee after my last update. She said that she knows which bartender I am talking about that was rude at my HS reunion and said \"he is really great, just not for banquets.\" She also said \"I do not know why any server would yell at you, that is just ridiculous.\" And my personal favorite \"And yes, there is bacon and lard in our re fried beans. I have no hispanic background, so I am not sure what is traditional. But they are pretty tastey.\" But then she says \"
With that said, I really hope you come back.\"

Direct quotes. And this employee has a glowing 5 star review for Aunt Chiladas and she says nothing about being an employee. Isn't this breaking some sort of Yelp rule? And what business does she have messaging me unless she is a manager? 

Sorry but I wouldn't trust any Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area that has less than 4 stars. There are many better choices."}
{"text":"Some of the best tamales ever! And they are huge and flavorful. The rice ehhhh kinda reminded me of rice a roni. This place is much more then just a restaurant they have music, pizza nite and all sorts of events."}
{"text":"Waiter was terrible food was terrible and I celebrate my birthday and it turned out terrible and drove a long ways to come here and was not satisfied overcharge on our bill and try to straighten it out but the waiter kept giving us a hard time waste of a trip and I ruined birthday"}
{"text":"I ordered the Machaca taquitos and they were very hard to chew with a lack of flavor. The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because it was cinco de mayo and want to cut them a little slack. Water is also served in small glasses almost comparable to shot glasses. When it's a hot day out in Arizona it's frustrating to keep refilling and not refreshing when Luke warm water is being served. I would not suggest going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Adorable spot for some great food.  You kind of have to dodge the birds outside but I thought their food was delicious.  Would like to go at night and enjoy the cute patio.  When friends come into town this will be a place we will go."}
{"text":"Great service and attentive staff, pleasant experience all around!  Planned our next event with their coordinator, Michelle, and can't wait to share the food and service with friends and family"}
{"text":"A Mexican restaurant & cantina that stands out in the southwest; unrivaled chips and salsa, quaint setting, striking and gracious staff.  Craving curbing classics like fajitas, enchiladas, tacos and tamales could easily have one overlook enchanting favorites such as shrimp stuffed pineapple or comforting chingalingas.  Inimitable ambiance has supported everything from weddings, charity events, and blow out Cinco de Mayo celebrations, to intimate date night getaways, happy hours, or Sunday brunches with visiting loved ones.  Monday night football, casual business gathering, or weekend day drinking; Aunt Chiladas is the neighborhood drop in for regulars and the stuff out of towners reminisce of once departed."}
{"text":"Fun place to celebrate a birthday and have some good Mexican food. We invited our family and friends to celebrate a  Birthday. The staff was friendly, and accommodating. The decor is very \"Mexican\" which helps create an authentic experience. Margaritas were good as well!"}
{"text":"I lived in Phx for my 1st 18yrs and I had never been here!! 
I brought my family with me and my aunt and grandma and my grandma had never been here and she usually knows about all these places. 
Very cool place. 
I got the El Pollo Fundido and the prickly pear margarita. 
the margarita didn't have much flavor difference then a regular one so I would try a different drink next time.
The fundido was great and I couldn't get enough of the sauce. The flour chips are really different and good also. 
Will be back!"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars because of the awesome experience that comes along with eating here. The employees are always friendly and attentive. The place is beautiful and has a little pond with ducks in it. It has a cozy, classic feel to it and the sopapillas are to die for!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but it has really gone downhill. Service was VERY slow for our last two visits, and the quality of the food has fallen as well. 

Last night, I watched a waitress dump an entire glass of ice water down the back of a lady sitting a few tables over, which was an honest mistake. What was irritating, was that customers were allowed to help clean up the the mess on the floor, and I didn't see a manager approach their table before I left a bit later.

It's really too bad. This used to be one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and nightlife. Neat patio with bocce ball and live music on most weekend nights. 

This place has a long history, dating back to its origin as a trading post for the local mines. That explains the jumbled layout and location inside the neighborhood.

The food is classic \"Gringo Mexican food\" - well done. The flour tortilla chips for the chips & salsa are fresh, and besides classics like burritos and tacos there are some unique dishes."}
{"text":"Look at me varying my locations.  I left Scottsdale.. holy cow some of my friends would say!  ;)   I was prompted to hit up this place by two girlfriends who live nearby.  So I ventured out.   I hit up the Happy Hour here.

The day we went they weren't able to provide any draft beers because the system was broken. Okay, I'll give that a pass. It was annoying, but eh.  Specials included drafts (which we couldn't have) $3 Coronas. I opted for the margarita which was served in a shaker.  These were $12 but there was about 2 1/2 drinks in there so it came out to be a sweet deal. What I really loved was the free small snacks they offered.  Fruit, chips/salsa, and chicken enchiladas are served during HH.  Free food!  

The chips we had there were ridiculous. In a good way.  Chips and salsa/guac are like crack to me in the first place.  But THESE chips were like freebasing meth (I'm not a drug user, I promise).  They were wheat based chips and were outstanding.  It was out of control.

I have been told and told and told some more that the brunch here is to die for.  I will definitely be back to partake.  I didn't order any food because hey, they gave me free enchiladas and I\"m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth."}
{"text":"I've had waaaay better Mexican. I grew up across the way from the barrios in Santa Ana so I know me some good Mexican.

Pros:

-Cute outdoor decor. That was it.
-the cheese crisp was ok.
-they had flour tortilla chips that were pretty tasty and a nice change from corn.

Cons:

-Food was not good. I can make better Mexican, and I'm Asian.
-ceviche tasted like frozen shrimp mixed with salsa. 
-drinks were watered down. I ordered a margarita and it came with a side tumbler so I was excited until I tasted it...watery. 

Verdict:

Would not go again although it was fun following the chilies on the path back to my hotel."}
{"text":"Every year in the dead heat of summer I retreat to Hilton Squaw Peak and my first stop (after the lazy river of course) is Aunt Chilada's. Oh, the atmosphere, the history of the restaurant, the food and the friendly faces make me feel at home every time I am here. Whether it is sitting outside at the outdoor bar or seeking refuge in the air conditioning it is simply the best part of my trip. All I have to do is follow the painted chili peppers from Hilton ( I actually use them to get home if too much patron was consumed .....just kidding. I call the Hilton to have the golf cart pick us up! Duh! No, really that is available for hotel guests!) The fish tacos are the best I have ever had and I am a snob from California.  The salsa is southwest style and really good. Very good beans and rice and free buffets daily at happy hour. Who can complain! Bands on Fridays are fun too. Overall this is a gem in the desert. Always featured on Fox TV  and was also spotlighted on Drinking Made Easy. If you haven't been then you are missing out! Live. Love. Eat at Aunt Chilada's."}
{"text":"Did someone actually refer to the salsa as Ketchup?! Oh hell no!! The salsa and chips are by far the best I have had in the valley. I was surprised this place got such mediocre ratings. I have been going here since I moved to the valley and it's always reliable.

The location is great because it is so different from anyplace else; Mexican or not. Tucked back of 16th st in a more residential area, the patio is great and there is always room even when it's busy.  The service is always good and then there is the chips and salsa. I don't see how anyone can knock it, it's always fresh. The more pico inspired salsa is chunky and has a good amount of cilantro. The hot red salsa is more of a paste but more authentic and delicious with some heat. The flour tortillas chips are always warm and delicious. Most of the time I load up on chips so much I just get a Tostada and a beer or house margarita. 

When I used to eat chicken and dairy the chicken chimi fundido was something I always went for. I get the veggie burrito on occasion now but that isn't anything great, it's got plenty of veggies but nothing to write home about(if my home was in Mexico). The veggies in it aren't what I think of when I think Mexican, it has carrots, cauliflower, etc in it. No peppers, onions, etc.....oh well.

I would just give it 3 stars if I didn't love the chips/salsa and location/ atmosphere so much. That bumps it up a star in my book. 

Salsa is like ketchup? Seriously? Sorry...I can't let it go.

Oh yeah, for awhile in 2008 every time my girlfriend and I went here it seemed there was always a wedding party, high school reunion, or other annoying large group gathering. In 2009 we haven't seen as much of it but be warned, you can usually still dine, but half the place is reserved and you have to deal with horrible band or MC music and exhaustingly obnoxious people."}
{"text":"Was not that impressed.. We were highly recommended to try this place out and decided to go for dinner.. Our waiter had no interest in us being there. The manager walked up to every table but us!! I would recommend going here if you want a good margarita ( that's about it) we will not be back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times. The first was after hiking Squaw Peak, running to Camelback, then hiking Echo Canyon. That day Aunt Chiladas' beers were ice cold and never tasted better. Other times I've visited were for dinner. Chips and salsa are awesome. Dinner plates were plentiful and delicious. Desserts were also amazing. Looks like they also expanded to accommodate private parties."}

{"text":"Been going to Aunt Chilada's for over 10 years now and I'm sad to see the quality of the food and service declining.  I had my wedding reception on the patio 11 years ago and could not have been happier.  Went for dinner last weekend for my wife's birthday and don't know if I'll ever go back.  Our group waited over an hour for our meals to arrive and during that time our waitress only came to the table once to take drink orders.  No one should have to leave their table and go to the bar to order a drink.  The one time our waitress did come by she said there was a mix up with our order.  When it finally arrived 3 of us asked for side of sour cream.  Unfortunately it never came.  Luckily for our waitress we had a large group so gratuity was automatically added to our bill.  Otherwise she would not have seen much."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but it took forever. They were promoting their Mexican pizzas, and you would think they had prepared for people to order, but regardless the place was not busy at all, it took over 1 hour and when the pizzas finally were out, they sent one and then the second 30 mins later.

The pizza was too spicy.

The waitress was very kind, but too busy to refill our drinks, which because of the pizza being too spicy was a very needed."}
{"text":"I'm a little conflicted in giving Aunt Chilada's a rating: I've been to the restaurant many times and would possibly say it's my favorite Mexican place to go for dinner (not that I've been to too many Mexican places since I just moved here and my boyfriend is a creature of habit).  The main problem is that the food has been a disappointment more often than not.

Love the hand shaken margarita, which comes with your choice of top shelf tequila and a floater (we usually go with Cointreau).  The flour chips are also really delicious, even if they're not authentic Mexican.  I was iffy on the salsa at first, since it has most of the garden thrown in (olives being the main rogue ingredient), but it's really grown on me over time.

Don't have too many recommendations on entrees.  The fajitas are ok and come with enough to take home for lunch or dinner the next day.  Pretty much everything else I've had has been a failure: greasy, oily quesadillas, dried out machaca and chicken in enchiladas, a chili relleno that was 75% breading.

Thing is, by the time I've enjoyed my margarita and some flour chips out on the awesome patio, I don't need much else to make me happy.  Two stars for an indoor experience, four stars for the patio.  Average it out for three overall."}
{"text":"I came here for the fifth meet up for The Breakfast Club UYE . . . and also finally lost my UYE \"V-card\"; haha! It was nice to finally meet others in the Yelp community. 

This was my first time visiting the location and trying their breakfast. Have visited the Tempe location by the Arizona Grand several times for dinner / drinks.

The service was a little slow, but there were several large parties. No big deal, I was too busy enjoying all these awesome conversations and getting to know others.

Complimentary chocolate fondue fountain - Hello, pineapple and strawberries! 

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros - Nothing special - not horrible, not amazing. 

Shout out to Monica O. for organizing this event; looking forward to attending many more!"}
{"text":"I just held my husband's surprise 60th birthday party at Aunt Chilada's and it went perfectly!  Everyone was amazing - from Michelle who coordinated my event and assisted with drink and food selections, to the servers, to the manager, to the front desk ladies.  Everyone was attentive, courteous, and helpful.  The food buffet was great (everyone loved the green corn tamales) and both the food and drinks were very affordable. There were no hidden costs and no worries.  They even included tables decorated with linens and balloons at no extra charge. I highly recommend using them for an event - they made sure everything went perfectly and we had a blast!"}
{"text":"This Phoenix gem is a must try! Been coming here for years with family for various events!"}
{"text":"Mexican eggs Benedict! Must try. Their chorizo is nice and crispy. Eggs cooked perfectly poached. Nice relaxing Sunday. The staff was very accommodating with our needs."}
{"text":"Too bad the chips and salsa are so darn good because we filled up so badly we could hardly eat our meal. The food was still tasty, however: I had the chicken mole, DH had the chingalingas, and the kids each tried a mexican choice off the kids' meals. Our server, Sara, was awesome - she offered to switch out one of the kid's meals when he complained about it being too spicy. For the record, he ate it all and said it was delicious. 

We've eaten there before and decided the best place to fully enjoy this restaurant's fabulous atmosphere is out on the patio so go when the weather is just warm enough to dine al fresco and when it isn't crowded with a private party."}
{"text":"Terrible experience, don't sit on the patio. We waited at least 25 minutes after being seated for lunch.  Nobody ever came to our table.  Finally somebody showed up and went to 2 other tables who had showed up 5 minutes or more after us.  She didn't have the courtesy of saying \"I'll be right there\". The place was slow so there was no excuse.  Not sure if the food was any good. We walked out."}
{"text":"What a great spot! Fun atmosphere outside ! I had some friends visiting from Seatlle & this was the perfect \" welcome to Arizona spot !\" they loved the kitchy name, friendly bartenders & the bar food was pretty tasty to boot!"}
{"text":"awesome fish tacos for lunch.    Great atmosphere and several fireplace and fountains for your enjoyment"}
{"text":"This place....Oh My.....
Well if you're a vegetarian...RUN. 
I got stuck at this place due to a corporate event my company hosted there. 
Let me say, how excited I was at the idea of Mexican food at the Christmas party. Then my vegetarian instinct kicked in when I got there....hmm....lets check for lard.
I asked the waitress who was going around...slowly I add but it was a busy night so maybe the service is faster when there isn't a huge event going on. (I'm thinking understaffed?....hoping?) Anyway, I was then informed that they cook their beans with bacon. What? Yes. Bacon. So there went the idea of a burrito, a tostada. Depressing. I ended up eating the very \"ehh\" chips (deep fried tasting and thicker than the typical chip. I'd venture to guess possibly flour chips?) 
I'm not a big drinker so the allure isn't there for the bar aspect. 
I will honestly never be back and from what the people who actually did eat there said I didn't miss anything."}
{"text":"Very good food with nice outdoor bar. Inside bar and table area is large and nice as well. Chips served are not your standard chip you would expect."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the food. The items we ordered were flavorless. Our orders were brought out wrong. Our server was seriously super slow. On the flip side the place is rather nice with a huge outdoor patio. Unfortunately, I do not foresee myself returning here."}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars and mainly for the atmosphere and homemade chips. I give them 5 stars for the atmosphere, but other than the chips the food just isn't that great. This place has the potential to be amazing, but it falls a little short.  If you want a fun experience, good drinks, and a cute atmosphere but can leave your food expectations behind then this is the place for you. I will be back, but just to sip cocktails on their patio."}
{"text":"Fell in love with their flour tortilla chips after a couple times visiting them- One night my boyfriendand I swung by to see if they sold them to go, and they DO! By the POUND! Absolutely love them!"}
{"text":"I give it a 3 for the ambiance and the cheese crisp being spectacular. Service needs a lot of work. I think our waitress spoke 3 sentences to us last night. We had to flag random servers a couple of times to get more water and chips as she never checked on us. We actually wanted dessert but she dropped the check without saying anything so we figured she didn't want us there anyway and got dessert somewhere else. I hate complaining, however I'm seeing terrible service becoming a trend everywhere so unless people complain nothing will ever get fixed. People work too hard to spend their money at establishments that don't take good care of them."}
{"text":"Was here last night for a Yelp event.  

Reason for the missing star - The handicapped stall in the ladies room on the patio - Its door latch/lock is broken.  Couldn't keep the stall door closed.  

Being almost 30 weeks pregnant and maneuvering in a regular stall - Not fun.  

Other than that - I've always loved this tucked away location!!  :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here both times and have gotten food poisoning each time. It's really quite a feat. I tried it the second time because a friend loved it and asked me to give it another shot.

Water bottles they bring to the table have a ring of dirt caked around the lip. 
Cleanliness of this establishment is questionable at best.
I ordered the green corn tamale both times and have spent my night gripping the toilet and cursing this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoyed the food this evening. The employees were so happy to help out with any questions we had. The food was above average.  The patio areas was what sold us. We will return at a later date for another great experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with fun staff and good food.  Go on March 10 and wish bartender Marie Happy Birthday!!"}
{"text":"I just went in for a takeout order, first time here. The setting and design of the restaurant is top notch. So cute. And everyone in there is so smiley and nice! Great customer service. I haven't even eaten the food yet but I definitely am giving them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Nice and accommodating wait staff. That was about it. Parking is weird. The front entrance is not where the parking lot is. It's on a side street. Then when you walk in you have to keep your kids from putting their hands in the algae filled fountain. I think the goldfish live off algae. They do wedding receptions there if you're into that sort of thing. The salsa and chips are overrated. The carne asada burrito was horrible. It tasted like charred asada. The kids liked the kids menu, but I've definitely had much better Mexican food. Please clean the algae filled fountain. Goldfish deserve better!"}
{"text":"Staying at a local hotel and was recommended Aunt Chiladas by our Uber driver. The outdoor patio ambiance was nice but we got a side outdoor area that felt a bit secluded from the nicer scene. The drinks and food was fine. I'm mostly downing the stars because of their lack of gluten free knowledge. Their menu clearly identifies gluten free or gluten modified items yet the server wasn't fully aware of the ingredients in the menu items. When the chips arrived, there was zero mention that they mix flour and corn tortillas. Of course I bit I to a flour chip the first bite. The food was fine, nothing to brag about but the lack of gluten knowledge (especially having pointed GF items out in the menu) really brought down the experience for me here."}
{"text":"My friends go to the free buffet most Fridays after classes so I joined them.
I was excited because they rave about how good the food is and the drinks are cheap!

HOWEVER....the buffet was set outside on the patio where it was freezing so the food was cold and gross. 

Why would you put uncovered hot dishes outside. Sternos cant keep up with that.
I guess starving students are less likely to notice cold food??

I would rather pay than eat that buffet again.

Makes me wonder how their regular quality and care to food temps is.

Not excited to try that again.
Cute outside space, games and places for dogs.
Spring may be a better time to enjoy this venue"}
{"text":"my friend and I went to dinner tonight and it was great; they had a live band in the bar, \"The Real Thing\", who were amazing; the reason for the one star was because of a waitress who ruined our night!  We were in the bar at least 20 minutes when we finally waived the waitress down (who passed by us at least six or seven times ignoring that we were even there), and ordered drinks. The waitress, Jessica, was totally rude and seemed to be irritated with us before we even ordered. She was obviously having a bad night and took it out on us.  What's happening to common courtesy and customer service?? Jessica shouldn't be in this position if she is going to have such a disrespectful attitude toward the general public, leave it at home..."}
{"text":"What a great spot to have brunch! Just a quick little drive north on the 51 from the Biltmore area. 
- Exceptional service: Cameron really creative a terrific guest experience. Very friendly and helpful with menu and drink items. 
- Chocolate Fondue Fountain!!!! 
- Patio: This area has a really cool ambiance. 
- Food: wonderful salsa and chips. Breakfast eggs and chorizo is delish!!!
Easy parking 
Great bloody Mary's"}
{"text":"I'm just not impressed. The food was fair, the service is fair, the place is fair. I even went there 2 days in a row (cause I was at a seminar) thinking maybe try again. I will not try this place again. You can! Maybe you will try something that is much better than everything I had. Good luck."}
{"text":"Bleeeaah!  Our first visit here.  I think the appeal is the landmark building and a touch of nostalgia.  Good service can't make up for the completely unremarkable (dare I say \"bad\") food and we did try a number of different entrees, all delivering the same marginal quality.  There are so many other really good choices for Mexican food in the Valley, I see no reason to return."}
{"text":"We were at the Hilton just down the street for Mother's Day weekend.  We enjoyed dinner here so much on Saturday night that we went the next day for mother's day brunch!  The food, service and atmosphere were all on point.  Tiffany helped us so much by moving our table to a shadier spot for brunch.  Just a small thing, but greatly appreciated! We were especially impressed by their head chef proudly carving the prime rib and pork loin for brunch.  He was super  nice!  Thank you for helping us have an amazing mother's day weekend!!"}
{"text":"Not the most Mexican-y of Mexican places I've been to, but passable as Mexican food. I have been here several times and never been blown away. Its been here for as long as I can remember, and is a stable as long as I can remember. Tonight we went for their happy hour and I was surprised to see that they offer a free buffet! Chips, salsa, mini enchiladas, taco meat and beans. Not bad! People were still ordering full meals though, but I was all about the freebies :)"}
{"text":"I used to live walking distance away from Aunt C's, and it was always a good time no matter what night we'd pay a visit even before the bocce ball court was installed.  The prices I think are a little inflated for their attachment to the Squaw Peak Hilton but as a regular you figure out that the flour chips and salsa fill you up VERY well and a couple of cold beers/margarita's go a long way with an appetizer and can be considered a meal.  

There may have been (very) few slip-ups over the years of visiting thus the 4 outta 5. But I have to admit we had our wedding rehearsal dinner here in the back room and they handled everything exceptionally from the whoops, we need another table, to wowing my new family here in AZ as well as my family from back east with great food and sopapillas (yum!), as well as keeping the margarita pitchers filled all night.  The outdoor patios and gardens make this place feel as though it's your own back yard, keep up the good work Aunt C's!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came in today for a nice labor day lunch, the hostess was really friendly and greeted us right away. We Sat down and our waiter Angel was just phenomenal. I was having a heard time deciding what to eat and he recommended the seafood quesadilla. It was delicious, he never let out drinks get to empty he was ready to fill them as soon as they looked remotely low. The environment of the restaurant feels like you're just hanging out with friends having a good time. I will definitely be coming here at least a couple times a month.  Our waiter asked us about our day and he seemed genuinely interested in what we had to say. As we left the same lovely hostess asked us to return, very friendly tall skinny lady."}
{"text":"Extremely over priced. Beans taste like dirt. She asked everyone if they wanted their sour cream and guac on top of their burrito etc, everyone said yes, as it turns out nothing comes with either so we were charged add charges for both sc and guac on each plate. We had ordered guacamole and chips for 2 people, but she charged us for 5 people based on how many people were seated at our table. We probably had at least 4 cups of wasted guac left on the table. Our bill was $100 for five people drinking water. Our waitress definitely scammed us, the guac was decent, the rest of the food was tasteless."}
{"text":"We eat here quite often.  My parents absolutely love this place, so this is their place of choice when it comes to mexican food.  The salsa and flour chips are absolutely amazing, but the entree dishes are just okay to good.  The service here is hit or miss.  Overall, a good place.  A very cool patio during the nice months of the year.  Just don't expect to eat the mexician food ever here."}
{"text":"Queso fundido has got to be the best thing I've eaten in phoenix. 

I was stuck in the area for a full two hours at around 1pm and decided to have lunch at walking distance from the endodontist I had an appointment with. 

It was hard to find the entrance, and almost gave up. Hint: it's on the back parking, right next to an old car husk. 

Once inside I was the only brown person, including the staff, which felt odd but I kept going. Walked to my table in the deep part of the semi-huge building (it's not a warehouse but it's very nicely divided to give you a sense of spaciousness) and sat next to a fountain with tons of silk flowers instead of water. Why am I telling you all these details? Because...  It's how this food is best described. It looks strange, and like it may not work. But once you experience it, the whole thing clicks and takes you, not to the same boring Fauxican food taco bell, but to a place where flour tortilla chips marry an almost sweet salsa (with black olives!!!), right before the entrée chicken melts along with all the cheesyness around it and yet their house made of a chimichanga shell (complete with a fideo backyard) remains crunchy and soft and expertly seasoned in all the right places. 

People seem to love working here, and why wouldn't they? They work in the Disneyland of magical Mexican food."}
{"text":"First time here was lunch yesterday. Very few people present, but it took our server more than 10 minutes to make first contact. \"I didn't know you guys were here\", I believe were her exact words. Sat outside, and it was nice but a little on the warm side for me. Scavenger birds were everywhere, landing on the tables and even plates (used & unused) looking for food. When diners left, birds immediately converged on their table and started eating. There is something very disconcerting about a blackbird eating sour cream off of a half-eaten burrito... I digress. I had the seafood burrito which was very good. Rice & beans were no better or worse than other restaurants in this class. My friend had the chicken sour cream burrito and also said it was good. Our table was very unstable, and it took more than one request to get something to shove under the \"short\" leg to stabilize it. Overall, not bad, but I probably will not be back."}
{"text":"I was invited to go with friends to a trivia night on Wednesday.  It sounded like it would be fun.  The trivia part was fun and there was a nice sized crowd.  I had a margarita and it was a bit sorry.  Tasted like it was from the cheap mix I drank in college.  Then came the food...it was a soggy plate of nachos with cans of junk dumped on it.  I ordered a taco because I was starving and the nachos were inedible.  The taco was soggy and greasy.  While the Trivia night was fun and i will go back...I think I will get a beer and try something else next time."}
{"text":"We called in (7:00 on a Monday night) to place a small carry out order, after being placed on hold for a few minutes, the team member came back on the phone and completely unapologetic ally stated \"actually we are not doing take out orders at this time\".
I asked what exactly that meant.... I mean \"no take out orders\"? 
\"Yes, the restaurant is too busy so we cannot help you with that tonight\".
So 1 star because Idk how possibly a restaurant can be that they turn away business...and offer no apology for doing so..but I guess we will not be giving them an opportunity in the future. Too bad too :("}
{"text":"So, I finally made it to breakfast club this morning here, and let me tell you, I really enjoyed both. I got to meet a new group of people and eat at a new restaurant, and I was extremely happy with both!

For starters, I got here at 10 am sharp, and realized that this place is closer to my house then I thought. I know they have a couple locations around the valley, but I think they have one in Tempe aside from this location as well.

When I arrived, the place was colorfully decorated and there were people slowly streaming in. I found my group, and we all sat on the patio.  Our server was super attentive, and I realized when she handed me the menu, that they had a weekend breakfast deal with healthy good looking food.  Yes, you can order from the main menu, but they have a great separate menu for their breakfast stuff on Saturday mornings.  

The server informed us of the complimentary chocolate fountain with fruit inside as part of the Saturday morning breakfast thing.  After we placed our orders, I went inside and grabbed some fruit and dipped it all in chocolate.  They had strawberries, cantaloupe, marshmallows and a few other items to choose from.  So tasty!

I reviewed the menu and decided to go with the fruit bowl with granola and a $3 Mimosa.  One of the other girls with me ordered the same thing as well, and the others got some good looking dishes as well.

The fruit bowl came out and it was so good looking!  Holy cow! I really enjoyed the whole thing and overall, the prices and the food were awesome.  Service was great too, and I will gladly be back in the future for more.  Thank you breakfast club, you have made my day...and aunt Chiladas's"}
{"text":"Sorry to say but I think I've had better Mexican food at Taco Bell.  The chicken for my taco salad was so over cooked it was practically jerky (but with less flavor). The margaritas were watered down. The draught beer was good though."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed in the lack of service tonight.  After a long visit we finally saw our waitress for the second time when she brought the check.  Will think twice about coming back."}
{"text":"I have to give Aunt Chilada's credit - we stayed for a quite a while at an outside table drinking our margaritas until we realized that at 10:30pm we were the very last people there and that the restaurant had pretty much closed down around us. They had already picked up the check and never pushed us out so we had a relaxing evening.

Unfortunately I was unimpressed with the food. The chips were light and crispy but the salsa tasted pretty generic. A spinach enchilada was very bland and a chile releno was mostly breading with a small chile and cheese but not much flavor. The two people who were with me agreed that their food was mediocre as well. We went with the frozen margarita only because we wanted a pitcher and the margarita on the rocks pitcher was much more expensive. The margarita was also unimpressive - perhaps the more expensive one would have been better but the regular on one the menu just tasted like frozen sour mix. 

We had a good time, but if I were to ever go here again I would probably just go for chips, drinks and appetizers which I could get somewhere else anyway."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here a week ago.  They advertised a free buffet for happy hour but turns out it is nothing more than chips and salsa.   They also have a fruit platter but who is going to eat that with the cantaloupe killing so many people. When we saw the \"Buffet\" we decided to try dinner.  Did not like the food. Just a tiny step above fast food.  The side dish was sone kind of noodles but they were cut up in about 1 inch pieces.  The beans were mashed and I almost gagged on them.  The chile relleno was the best part of the meal but still not up to par with the Barrio Cafe,  I do not plan on going back here again.  Can't believe their quality of food since they are located in a high class neighborhood.
Their adsvertising photos below are terrible.  Photgrapher used very bad lighting and it shows."}
{"text":"Not really impressed. Food was below average, in my opinion. Chips were just extra greasy, salsa watered down, meals without much taste. Yes, the patio is pretty cool and I imagine that on a busy night this is the place to be, but really, not impressed.

Could be because I had a 13 hour workday, still had food poisoning, and just wanted to be home instead of off for business, but this didn't really make my mood change for the better. Guess that if I was boozing it up it'd be more fun, but then again, what place isn't more fun while boozing it up?"}
{"text":"We had a really good time here. It was an easy walk from the resort over to the restaurant. It was about 9 o clock when we got there and the place was packed and music was loud, not too loud but enough to set the vibe. Luckily the place is huge do we were still able to get seated right away. Service was good and consistent and the food was delicious. My wife had street tacos and I did a shredded beef chimi w/ red sauce. I would recommend both. They had plenty of beer options to choose from from and a solid Margarita. They have a lot of Tequila options so of course we took a few shots as well. Had a great bar tender who comped a few shots for us to try out as well. Good night and good food. Worth a shot wether your at the resort or not."}
{"text":"Wowzer, this is quite overwhelming. It is very easy to get lost here. Multiple rooms and nooks and crannies for dining everywhere. I think there was a wedding and a quinceanera going on along with at least 3 birthday parties.
This place is definitely festive and we had a table next to the bocce court. The cocktails are ok. Margaritas are made with mixer instead of fresh squeezed lime.
The food is solid mexican. I had the fajitas which were ok. It was kind of a mash up of chicken, peppers and onions. I am used to fresh al dente veggies(broccoli, carrot, squash, peppers and onions) and this was not that.
Great for kids - after dinner they can root around the treasure chest for a treat.

Solid festive restaurant."}
{"text":"I live around the area and have gone here five times now. On Wednesday nights, they have Team Trivia and it's a lot of fun! Randy, the host, is super energetic and awesome - def gets the crowd going.

The homemade tortilla chips are A M A Z I N G. They are complimentary so make sure you grab some! Most of the time I've gone, I got the spinach & chicken enchiladas. It is pretty good and definitely my go-to. I've had their original margaritas as well and I gotta say that it's worth the price.

Parking is very convenient. There is a lot of seating indoors & outdoors. Overall a fun place to go to with coworkers and friends after a long day."}
{"text":"Best chips EVER! 

When I am craving chips, salsa, and a delicious burrito this is where I come! The service is attentive and the food is great. 

The atmosphere is so fun and there is always something exciting going on here. Whether it's bocce ball, a band playing, games on tv, trivia night, or a special event there is always entertainment. They have a beautiful patio as well as an inside bar area and a large dining room, so it's always easy to find a spot. 

This is a fantastic place to bring a date, a friend, the family, or just go solo."}
{"text":"Great food, good drinks and an incredibly cool atmosphere. The live music on Friday's makes for such a fun treat! I always take friends from out of town here. The staff are all super nice, and the service is prompt! This is a neighborhood favorite for me!"}
{"text":"Myself & family had horrible experience at this establishment. Bad service's not enough waiter/waitress. The food is no where nearly as good as Tempe location. This place is mostly enjoyed by non-locals that don't know Mexican Food. The employees pay better attention to non-locals (folks that are staying at The Point). I rather go to Tempe location which is much better. Never coming back to this establishment. Not recommended."}
{"text":"This place has a fun atmosphere. It has a live band on Friday night as an example. I ordered the Sea Food Enchiladas which was pretty good. It was stuff with cheese, shrimp and scallops wit sides of bean and rice. I cleaned the whole plate and I don't usually eat beans.  Tip - parking isn't always the best."}
{"text":"Today we did what we call the \"Aunt Chiladas Dreamy Draw Ride\" at the end of heart thumping  leg pumping 40 min ride on road bikes, we go into the historic joint to hang at the bar with Marie. I drink tea, he drinks Corona Light. We don't eat. It's fun to envy the Chingalingas the workin' guys down the bar are scarfing. Good banter, lots of laughs and historic surroundings. Until next week, when we ride here again and inhale the scent of mesquite and homemade flour tortilla chips."}
{"text":"WHY does this place have bad reviews!?!?!? 
This place is awesome. I literally have never had mexican food this good....EVER!
First of all, they have not one, but TWO types of chips for their chips and salsa. The flour torilla chips are the bomb. I could've eaten all that they had. They have black olives in the salsa. Seems weird, but it is delicious! Guac=fabulous. Had margaritas and they were of course great! We both got the pollo fundido per our waiters recommendation. I was mindblown at how good this was! I am still dreaming about it! I cannot wait to return here! We sat on the patio with other visitors and had a ball!"}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to return. My last visit left me feeling a bit cold.
(A new-ish girl working the outside bar was giving a LOT of her attention to a particular patron, and drinks, food, etc. was slow coming)

Marvin was our server tonight. He's got LOTS of energy.

Had a carnitas chimichanga. Delicious, as always!

Love the flour chips, and the hot salsa.

I will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good dinner.  My margarita of the month was very good and they had a large selection of tequila and margarita options was fun."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great prices. Do yourself a favor and get the Prickly Pear Margarita. The chips with the salsa were a mix of flour and corn which I really liked."}
{"text":"This is a fun place, it's huge with multiple bars and games to play. There was a live band the night I went. They also had $5 Tigers Blood margarita specials that tasted really good. I don't know how often those will be around. Try Tweeting your arrival there, you might get a big surprise like I did. Manager tweeted me back and bought me a drink"}
{"text":"I love you Aunt Chilada's Mothers Day was stressful and We arrived late at 8:30pm I am sure that it was a busy day for them. I love the chips and salsa, My dinner was good but my husband gets the taco salad and they must have ran out of meat, they gave him a very small side of taco meat, weird and the staff was getting restless, we ate quickly and left, but all in all I got my Mexican food on Mothers Day."}
{"text":"Start with service. Place was busy on a nice Friday night at 7 PM. Should have made a reservation. About a 30 minute wait for a party of 4 for next available seating.  When we got inside there were a lot of open tables (must have been short servers). Hostess was bubbly and very friendly. 

Our food server said she was relatively new and had very few suggestions as for best plates available. She rarely swing by our table. I think 4 times the whole night including dropping off the bill and picking it up.

Food review: I really liked the chips before dinner. I had the chicken and spinach enchilada. Was good but not over the top. I asked if I could substitute vegtables as one of my sides and was told yes. When I got my bill I was charged $3 for a side of vegetables. I didn't complain to the server because I think she would have struggled with adjusting the bill. 

My wife ordered the fish tacos. She really enjoyed them and the tarter sauce was great.

My father had the burrito fundido as the only recomendation from our server. He said it was about average, not excellent but good.

My son had a quesadilla. How can you go wrong there?

Price: price was average. Not to expensive or cheap.

Would I return? I doubt it. I would find another place."}
{"text":"Saturday so I expected it to be pretty busy but this place was SLAMMED. Our waitress seemed stressed and you could tell. 

I was in the mood for some good chips and salsa.. the chips were pretty good because they were made in house but the salsa in my opinion was super watery and had too big of chunks of tomato in it. 

The best part about the place was the beerita, but other than that I probably wouldn't go back for the food. For a Mexican restaurant I felt like the menu was limited."}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's is a great place to rack up a huge liquor bill. If you work in the area, or are like me and always attend wine tastings in the area, then this is the place to go afterwards.  
I've been quite a few times with a big group of people and we always have a great time. 
Our server is always fast, the drinks flow freely and the food is pretty good.
It's just a fun little place to hang out, chat with friends, sip some cocktails and eat pretty decent Mexican food.
I don't know if I would travel all the way to Aunt Chilada's if I wasn't already in the area- that is unless it's for Cinco de Mayo. There's no better place to celebrate than Aunt Chilada's. But if you plan on joining the festivities, get there suuuuuper early to secure a spot or it will be standing room only!"}
{"text":"Good food. Relaxed atmosphere. Good drinks. Not much more required. The tables wobble a bit from the uneven tile floor. So there's that.....

Chips and salsa"}
{"text":"A short walk from the Hilton Pointe brings you here. Fresh salsa and chips were served right away. Friendly staff and plenty to choose from on the menu. The Street Tacos were tasty as was the guacamole appetizer. One in our party order a vodka tonic and the tonic was flat, same for the replacement drink but that can happen to anyone. The food was tasty and serving time was about 10 minutes. Grab a seat in the outdoor courtyard and watch a Bocci game while you dine. Tina Ann took good care of us and was friendly and engaging. Good prices and a pleasant dinner."}
{"text":"Service is decent, food is just okay, and location is a little hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for. It's a crazy fun place during happy hour - voted one of the best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Book a reservation on Yelp, they are always busy.  Fresh made warm chips & delicious salsa.  Ordered the fabulous guacamole, some of the best we've had.  Everything we ordered was really flavorful.  Tortilla soup is cheesy and has the right amount of spice.  Chicken Fundido was the bomb-dido!  Tacos are excellent, fresh fried hard shells.  Kids loved them!  Chicken enchiladas were superb!  Tamales were good- not great, red beef was spicy, green corn was different.  I couldn't tell if they were short handed, but our waitress disappeared for long periods, could have filled our drinks more.  The rest of the staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Great local place. I was staying with a friend right down the street so Aunt Chiladas became the \"go to\" place when we didn't want to drive anywhere.  

I tried the chicken and spinach enchiladas as well as the seafood enchiladas on different visits.  The chicken and spinach enchiladas were bland but the seafood enchiladas were very good, containing shrimp and bay scallops. Each was accompanied by rice and beans, traditional although I thought that the beans had an overwhelming lard flavor.

The complimentary chips were good - including both flour and corn chips. The mild salsa was flavorful, with black olives in it...interesting."}
{"text":"We went here while visiting our son and grandson in Phoenix

I cant say that I was too impressed with the meal. I got a beef tamale and 2 beef enchiladas which were OK but far from anything special. The Fiedo was pretty tasty and we both thought that the chips and salsa were good, especially the flour ones.

Will we go back, possibly during happy hour for the free buffet and because the chips and salsa here are very tasty."}
{"text":"Invited by friends to go here for dinner on a Sat night and read all the Yelp reviews beforehand to try to get an idea of what food to order (most of the reviews don't really talk about any good/bad particular dishes).  The place looks old and outdated, especially for a hotel type restaurant.  We were seated out on a back side patio which was fine until BIG winged bugs arrived after we ate.  Anyway, the frozen margaritas were good and I ordered the Street Tacos, which were okay but the beef in them could not have been cooked anymore as it was tough and not very tasty.  Chips and salsa are pretty good.  Our group of 7 all ordered different things and no one had had rave reviews or bad comments about their dishes. We ordered flan, fried ice cream and sopapias (sp?) for dessert, which were all polished off.  I live in the Valley and given the multitudes of very good to great Mexican places we have, I don't need to return to Aunt's."}
{"text":"There are many Mexican restaurants you could go to in Phoenix.  Most of them are very similar with the menu and flavors.  I put this one above most.  The food is good, the menu has everything you would expect to find and a few you might not.  But the atmosphere and service put this place high on my list.  I really enjoy the mix of chips you get.  Some fluffy some crisp.  Yum,,,"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood Mexican restaurant. It has the coolest patio with lots of plants, Bocci ball and tons of outdoor seating, plus it is dog friendly. They have food for free at happy hour and all sorts of interesting margarita options... My favorite is mango. Of course, it is also a restaurant and not just a bar. 

I have to admit that the food is not the best Mexican food out there. Some of it is pretty good though. I like their fajitas, beef chingalingas, shrimp tacos and green corn tamales. Their real claim to fame is their chips. They bring a huge basket of both corn and flour chips... The flour chips are not like any other chips I've had anywhere else--they are thick and soft and crisp all at the same time... their mild chunky salsa is also really good.  But, I have been thoroughly repulsed by their fish tacos which were soft and squishy and weird. 

Overall, I like it here and come back often, though  now that I have found items I like, I rarely try new things.   This is the place to be on a Friday night and I highly suggest you come for happy hour."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal but my wife and kids prefer corn tortillas instead of flour. Reasonable price and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Overrun with people on Cinco de Mayo. That's not bad. Big gringo party night.

What's bad? Weak cocktails in little 4-oz Dixie cups for $5.50. Starting a tab at one bar and needing to close it out when you go to another of the 4 bars inside because the cash registers don't talk to each other. No food service at any of the bars.

So probably not the best night to review the place, though I've been there several times over the years on non-\"holiday\" nights, and it never really succeeds in impressing much--in any way, really. . ."}
{"text":"Really liked the food. The fiancee's sis got some sort of veggie fajitas...I'll DEF get that the next time I go back. Not much else to say, it was a mexican restaurant. They are so numerous in Phoenix, it's hard to be super impressed. I'd definitely go back though. Everything on the menu looked tasty!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican place in AZ! Chips are flour, light and crisp. Salsa is fresh with black olives and fresh green onions. Chicken fajitas are my favorite. Marinated just right. Staff is great. Love this place. Oh did I mention that it has a beautiful environment? A must see."}
{"text":"I've come to really enjoy Aunt Chiladas! I hadn't heard of them until referred there by a former employee when I was looking for a place to have Sunday watch parties for the Indianapolis Colts fan club I help organize. Unfortunately the 2017 season was not kind to the team, so our attendance was low. But Jennie and her staff were always cheerful and positive when we came, no matter how small the group was. Because most of the Colts games were the 10a/11a early games, we pretty much had TV of choice... and sometimes given sound, or even the big TV and all over sound! 

Their chips = BOMB DOT COM. d00d-- how do they make them so effing fluffy and not like a normal tortilla chip?! I could pretty much eat a basket or2 of those myself when I wasn't terribly hungry for something on the brunch menu (besides mimosas and chocolate fondue). 

Their menu is massive BTW- and they serve massive plates! Pretty much anytime I'd order from the menu I'd leave with a to-go box. Even the simple things like quesadillas are bigger than my hands! Totally worth the price.

Aunt Chilada's spot is also quite unique to AZ being that they hold AZ liquor license #1 and the building literally has history in the woodwork. Ask one of the family members for the 411 on the building and you'll get taken on a stroll thru AZ history."}
{"text":"Historic. Lovely. Friendly. Tasty. Our party loved it. They accommodated our change of tables from inside to outside without skipping a beat. They couldn't have been lovelier."}
{"text":"We had a 50th Anniversary party here... It was perfect! They went above and beyond in helping to make sure everything was taken care. The food was great... We had left overs and everyone wanted to know where the chicken/spinach enchiladas were. We didn't have any of those left, and i was worried, that people wouldn't eat much of them because of the spinach. They were delicious! Everyone one loved the food. The fideo was just as good. I was a little worried that the kids that attended the event would be bored, but this place is perfect for ALL ages... if you have it out on their beautiful patio, there is so much to do for everyone! I can't wait to find another event to have to come back! All 55 people in our party raved about how nice a place it was. Thank you Aunt Chiladas, everyone did an awesome job! You made our event perfect!"}
{"text":"FLOUR TORTILLA CHIPS!! Omg. I'm addicted. Their frozen margaritas are incredible too, especially with some grand mariners floated on top. Their ambience is so nice and relaxing as well. Definitely one of my top 3 favorite Mexican restaurants!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed before, I've been here over 50 times. 

Nightlife was hotter at Auntie C's back in 2011 when I first moved into the neighborhood. It's still great for brunch, though. Especially on a warm day when you can sit on the huge patio. It's also nice when you can find room by one of the fireplaces for a drink on a cold night.

The staff is still friendly and the food is decent. Live bands most weekends. Go see the CPP play some night if you want to dance and sing along. Gail can sing the hell out of anything.

Do not fear the black olives in the taco meat at the free happy hour spread on Fridays."}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's is a one-location Mexican-themed restaurant which is basically the in-house restaurant for the Pointe Hilton at Squaw Peak.  The previous local locations have been closed and the North Phoenix location remains.  Already that is a plus in their favor.

Thankfully it has more fun and character and less overpriced food and drink than most hotel restaurants.  It is a decent size and has both indoor and outdoor dining areas.
We had a party of about a dozen so it's hard to describe each meal.  Because I had a large late lunch my dinner I had the lettuce wraps, which came in at less than $9 and very filling.  There is a good selection of cold tap beers and of course a full bar.

Service was excellent for a restaurant that does such a large business with business travelers and vacationeers (i.e. snowbirds).  We were there during trivia night so we expected things to be on the loud, rowdy side and they were.  The only negative was after that group left and there were only a few small groups of people, the house did not adjust the background music down to a more appropriate level.

Before posting this I thought I would check out the \"worst\" reviews (and yes they actually are the worst reviews).  Not surprisingly the stereotype is true that most of them are from towns that are not exactly known for their knowledge and appreciation of Mexican food, you know, where they think Taco Bell is gourmet?  No, in reality, Aunt Chilada's is not gourmet, but it is decently good, the ambiance is great and the wait staff is many steps above average."}
{"text":"This place was great! I went there for a baby shower and it was was wonderful. The room was super cute, I love the ambiance of the place...and the food was amazing. I cannot wait till the weather cools down because the patio looks very inviting. If anyone is looking for a venue for a party, look no further!!!"}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's is one of my favorite places to eat outdoors in Phoenix, when it's not cold, and when it's not 100 million gazillion degrees. 

They have rockin happy hour specials, great margaritas, and pretty good Mexican food. It's a little gringo, but it's yummy, and when my parents were buying, it was great! ( I ate here a lot in college).

I'm a fan of the chips and salsa, too."}
{"text":"Aunt Chiladas is the place to be. This restaurant is a phoenix staple, been here forever. Nadia, well she'll welcome you with a smile and start your dining experience off right."}
{"text":"A terrible HH!! We brought 20 people for a pre-homecoming party... All purchased alcoholic beverages- some ppl multiple beverages .. Food consisted of three banquet trays( one nacho, one enchilada, one chingalinga) HH was suppose to last until 6.30 food stopped at 5.45. Servers kept pushing he expensive stuff . We will head somewhere else with our dollars .. Great example of sad hour ... Nothing happy her"}
{"text":"I was here a good 10 years ago.  Service and food was great back then.  My how things go bad so quickly!  First thing that set me off was nothing has changed in 10 years and it looks like a few things need repaired.  The wait was about a half hour.  My son almost fell after sitting in a broken chair.  Finally we were seated.  The homemade chips were good but the bottom ones were store bought.  The old put the store bought chips on the bottom trick.  I should have walked then but everyone was tired of waiting and hungry.  My son is a picky eater to say least.  I ordered a cheese quesadilla for my kid.  I specifically told the waitress, NO ONIONS, NO TOMATOES, and NOTHING BUT CHEESE.  I even told her if he finds one it will cause an incident.  She seemed to understand. The food I ordered was OK.  I had to use my salsa to make it a little hotter.  I can eat fire so this is no surprise.  My son's cheese quesadilla had tomatoes in it.  At first I told him it was just one and I picked it off.  Then he kept finding them in every slice.  I called the waitress over and explained.   She apologized and took the plate back.  A few min. went by and the waitress had the NERVE to come out and ask if it was just one.  I had already told her it had tomatoes all over in it.  At this time I felt humiliated by her actions and told her just bring a cheese crisp and I'll pay the difference.  It took a while for that to get to our table but all was OK.  While we ate a waiter dropped a napkin bringing food to another table.  When he came back I thought he'd pick it up after almost tripping on it himself.  Nope, he left it there so someone else could trip on it.  He came back a few minutes later so I flagged him down and let him know about the napkin.  Instead of saying \"oh I'll pick it up right away.\"  The waiter boomed in a very loud voice how sorry he was and it would never happen again.  He was loud enough for everyone to hear in the room.  Again, I felt humiliated.  I guess not wanting the restaurant to get sued because some waiter won't pick up a napkin was asking too much.  The waitress did comp my sons food.  I will never go back.  At one time that area had some very nice places.  The area had CLASS.  That's not the case anymore.  5/10/14"}
{"text":"Pathetic translation for a restaurant.  People heed to the Yelp stars! Waited 35 min for food, we walked out. The service was so so bad.  The salsa was horrible, tasted like a can of El Pato chile.  The waiter was perspiring and kept wiping his face with hands & touching everything! Disgusting! Hostess were high school rejects lacking customer service.  The restaurant is dark the ceilings are filthy.  We never got  passed the chips & salsa.  Thank God we walked out when we did! Will never return.  I give it 1 star for diet Pepsi. There is an abundance of excellent restaurants in area."}
{"text":"Just finished lunch @ Aunt Chilada's.  Outstanding food, great drinks & we walked to it with the Sun on our backs.  If you are in Phoenix - I recommend it.  Prices are very fair."}
{"text":"I have been here twice before and enjoyed it and have even recommended it to friends.   I'm not sure what was going on today, but the food was bland and the service was so slow. I didn't pick up on this before, but the menu is way overpriced for the food you get. A boring bean burrito is 9 dollars! I have had better off the dollar menu at Taco Bell - I don't even like Taco Bell!  I won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. On the work trip and staying next to this place at the resort. Everyone I ran into from the airport recommended this place.
Best chip and salsa! The salsa was chunky, fresh, and great flavor...and it is complementary.
Ordered 2 green chile enchiladas. Delicious! comes with rice and choice of bean
Laid back ambiance that needs a remodel as it is outdated
Alittle pricey for a mexican food place that is so laidback but the food was worth it"}
{"text":"This place is amazing year after year! Authentic and delicious food! The service was great too! Compliments to the chefs"}
{"text":"Very sad. Slip, slip, slippin' away... And, quickly. I note the progression of my reviews in just the last 2-3 months moving down.

The server was ebullient but was slow to check back to see what was needed. She kept coming to a table 2 away but would turn her back and walk away from our table vs. giving a glance to check for empty beverage glasses.

Sunday night and the crowd started to shuffle in closer to 7 p.m.

Chicken fajita quesadia was meh. And, that's the thing: for \"American-ized\" Mexican food, Aunt Chilada's - this one, not the awful one in Tempe - was usually consistent and on their game. Quality is starting to be noticeably less than over all the years (been coming here since mid 80s).

Used to be on The List to seek out when nearby and hungry. No longer on that list.

Sad."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa in the wide world and delicious hand-tossed margaritas. The staff is incredibly friendly, and the atmosphere is impressive. Do yourself a favor and order the Creamy Chipotle Chicken. You're welcome."}
{"text":"This place has the best patio. I love sitting outside at the bar having a drink. Definitely a good place to sit back and unwind after hiking."}
{"text":"Had our company Christmas party here and it was a great venue. The bartender and staff were nothing short of amazing. The food was delicious! Overall, a great experience and the place was perfect for a company party. Kudos Aunt Chilada!!"}
{"text":"Bocce Ball's, that was a some spicy Tortillion!
What do you think about when you think about Bocce? 
I know...my thoughts turn immediately to Mexican food, too!
Aunt Chilada's has set up a bocce court right next to the walkway in the courtyard. When I first saw the bocce court, it was jarring...like walking by the sushi bar at Houston's...just because you can doesn't mean you should. 
But, someone near the top of the Chilada family may, in fact, be a marketing genius! That thing really got a workout while we were there the other day.
The Beautiful Carin and I hadn't been back to Tia Chilada's in a year or so, but we needed to reconnoiter...my strong and handsome son, Zachary and his lovely wife, Sarah are visiting next week and they want to go (good memories of another great visit:)
We wandered in at happy hour (absolutely the best time to visit the Chilada family). 
Lots of people drinking, eating chips and salsa, etc. (though not as many as past visits...the economy?). 
We had no trouble getting a nice table out in the patio area, so we could watch an Italian sports staple being played in a Mexican restaurant:)
The people watching at Aunt Chilada's is wonderful..all walks of life, all shapes and sizes...all getting their drink on with cheap margarita's and cheaper cerveza:) It's a tried and true formula for the transition from drone infested, uptight (I know, a word right out of the 60's) work-a-day world to a somewhat more relaxed, slightly (or heavily) inebriated night-time world. 
So much fun to watch...esp. the guy with a six pack of margarita's under his belt, trying to bowl the bocce's. 
It would be pretty tough to generate a bocce injury, but I think he managed it:)
The service was a pretty good...we never had to wait too long for refills and they kept the chips and salsa coming ( the flour tortilla chips are one of the best parts of Aunt Chilada's:)
Carin had a serviceable chicken chimichanga, and I had something called a tortillion (which, interestingly enough is numeral based nomenclature for this dish, reflecting the number of calories per serving)...shredded beef, cheese, beans, tomatoes, bacon (bacon!!!!), wrapped in a giant tortilla, dipped in egg batter and deep-fried...it sounded better than it was, but I ate about  1/2 and brought the rest home (might still be in the fridge, growling at me...not sure..afraid to look:)
Nope, it's not the best Mexican restaurant in town, and it's not the best bocce court you'll ever see, but combined, they make Aunt Chilada's a decent place to have a bite and a cocktail, and to play the games that people play:)"}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love this place!  Absolutely awesome restaurant. The chips, salsa and guacamole are all incredible. Also, the jalapeño fajitas are to die for if you like spicy food!  I'm so happy that I live in Phoenix now so I can finally go here often."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST chips and salsa in Arizona. The flour chips and the salsa are soooooo good. Seriously - SO good. Its fresh and chunky and to die for it. Its almost worth going JUST for the chips and salsa and a margarita. I'm shocked that Aunt Chilads only has three stars - its one of the better Mexican restaurants in the Valley for many reasons. 

If you want an ambiance that makes you feel like you're in Mexico - this is the spot for you. Sit outside and you're surrounded by a cute bar, plenty of seating, music and lush greenery that just makes you feel like you're in a Mexican Cantina. I think they even had bocce ball. The margaritas are great and the food is good too. No complaints here."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Phoenix for several years now and we always make a point to have dinner at Aunt Chiladas. Yesterday about 4:30 we stopped to have dinner. We sat at the bar (as we usually do) for a couple cocktails and dinner.  The bartender was a younger women (early 30s), she wiped our spot down leaving in dripping wet. I asked if she could hand me a couple napkins so I could dry it and she waved the menu over it attempting to dry the counter top. When that was unsuccessful she tossed a couple napkins down and walked away. We ordered a couple drinks and as we sat there we watched as she overly fraternized with the men at the bar to the point of neglecting the needs of other patrons. However that was tolerable, even if inappropriate. As we sat there the worse was yet to come. When when of the other patrons order a large plate of nachos she began sampling from his plate (obviously she liked  nachos).She was taking the food with her fingers, from his plate and placing it into her month then cleaning her fingers in a \"finger licking good\" fashion, and continuing to wait on and serve other patrons. At that point we were done and left. In all the years we have been dinning at Aunt Chiladas we have never experienced such a horrible display of professionalism in the food serving business. Needless to say that will be our last trip to Aunt Chiladas....."}
{"text":"What the hell?  I have never experienced a restaurant go down the toilet so fast.  Its like a bad night in mexico.  Service sucked, but the food sucked more.  if by chance you want the blandest food this side of england, this place is for you, but if you want any form of mexican fare, you'd be better off going to taco smell, and I am no fan of fast food, whether it be from north of the border or farther north of the border.  I used to be a big fan of the Aunt, but I can confidently say I will never, ever give this place another try, it was really that bad."}
{"text":"The food was fine and the staff was friendly. I appreciated how easily they split the check between our group of 8."}
{"text":"Real Frat Bar scene.  Bad drinks, worse service.  Bar so bad it's an insult.  Sure, the place is a bit crowded, but that's no excuse for repeatedly sloppy service."}
{"text":"My favorite part about this place is the chips they bring out for the chips and salsa. They make their own flour tortilla chips. Yes, flour. The texture is a fun and an interesting change from the typical tortilla chip. They do throw in a few regular chips, I think to fill out the bowl and satisfy those who like normal chips and salsa better.

Their salsa is good but I am not a fan of olives in my salsa. Seems like a odd addition, but easy enough to eat around.

If you go on the weekend they have a free chocolate fountain between 10am-2pm. The first time I saw it I thought it was an odd compliment to a Mexican food meal. But hey, it's chocolate... So do yourself a favor and have dessert first. You want to make sure you have room, right?

They do offer a free \"buffet\" during happy hour. It used to be better and more offerings years ago but it's still nice to have complimentary food to munch on during happy hour. 

Good food. Standard Mexican fare. Not a huge fan of the enchilada sauce, which I keep forgetting since I typically get a burrito \"enchilada style\". But I keep coming back for those delicious chips and forget I should get something different from my usual."}
{"text":"Meh it was ok street tacos are not street tacos now my co worker ordered tacos Jesus and those looked good and looked like street tacos, someone needs to send cooks to East LA to see what street tacos look and taste like now the tamale was ok but you can tell they did an southwest mex twist in it as well, please stop messing with legit Mexican food just make it the way it should be."}
{"text":"Great food, unique atmosphere, decent price, great crowd. I can't rate this bar-wise yet as I've only stopped by past 10pm in hopes they were still serving food (just moved to Phoenix recently). I'm giving this 5 off the restaurant atmosphere, quality, service, and food. I always recommend this place when we have visitors."}
{"text":"We had a bachelorette party at the Pointe Squaw Peak and came to Aunt Chilada's for dinner. Their website says you have to arrive by 4:30 in order to reserve patio seating, but upon calling we discovered they don't adhere to that policy. Too late; we had to sit inside. The server was so rude that we asked for another. Food took an hour to get. They got at least two orders wrong - three times! They refused to split the tab. We discovered why service was taking so long when a member of our party went searching for the restroom and discovered the entire staff huddled in the hallway talking about our horrible table. I never saw the patio, just the nearly empty room they sat us in to wait for food. The food was typical Mexican food. I can't remember worse service at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's has it's charm. The front patio (on Dreamy Draw) is filled with mature trees, fountains & vegetation. It's really a perfect atmosphere to pretend you're in the Yucatan swilling Tequila in the jungle if  you like that sort of thing...

They have these fantastic flour chips & salsa that come with your drink- I can eat a whole basket of them before the main course arrives. I always get the taco's and they're consistently good, not great. They make strong margarita's. They have a chocolate fountain on Sundays too.

Oh yeah, this is another place you can bring your dog onto the patio.

BOTTOM LINE:  Great neighborhood Mexican, one of AZ's best patios!"}
{"text":"After hearing so many people talking about Aunt Chiladas, I finally decided to eat dinner here. 

First off, I think the service was very good. The waitress was quick, friendly, and efficient. The food, while decent and tasty, did not really impress me as much as I had expected. But it was reasonably priced. And the portions were generous.

I would definitely come here again in the near future."}
{"text":"When asking for an extra tortilla for my fajitas they gladly gave me one and charged me an extra 2.50 without telling me. 2.50 for a tortilla after paying $15 for a fajita plate. That's pretty steep. And without saying a thing when inquiring. BS"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here earlier this week with my boyfriend after not stopping in for what was at least a few years. My good friend had her wedding reception here back in 2013 or 2014. It was a small wedding and they handled it great. Food was good, bartenders were good. I think something may have happened, our experience this time was unfortunate. Food was cold, the enchiladas were super soggy. Drinks were ok. Just kinda disappointing. I hope it was just a off night. We live right down the street and I used to love this place, I'll try to give them another shot."}
{"text":"Service here sucks.  Our \"waitress\" took forever to get our food, and then didn't bring utensils, plates or napkins.  I had to keep going up to the bar to get a drink.  Several times I waited too long.  One time I went up there and there was no one working there.  I should have just put on an apron and walked behind the bar myself and made my own drink.  Still, they have an awesome set up outside for enjoying the warm Phoenix nights.  I dont' understand why the band has to play inside.  I guess people who live nearby complained about the noise.  Then don't live next to a f*cking bar!!! Idiots."}
{"text":"I went here for the Breakfast Club on Saturday morning and will have to say that the company was 5 stars, but the food and experience was more like a 3 star. We all sat out on the patio, which was nice. They gave us chips and salsa...the salsa was a little odd (had olives in it) and the hot salsa was not hot, tasted like slightly spiced tomato sauce or something. The chips were really good though, they were fried flour tortilla chips, not the typical corn. They also give you a free trip to the chocolate fountain, which was pretty good. The fruit was fresh and the chocolate was....chocolate...seriously, can't go wrong there. With breakfast, I got a mimosa which was only 3$, so that was pretty good. It was nothing special tasting, but it was cheap and alcohol. For breakfast I got the benedict with chicken. This is where they kind of went wrong. The chicken was dry and did not seem to be cooked fresh, or if it was, it was overcooked. The eggs were messy, the person poaching them let the whites go all over so it wasn't one cohesive egg and the eggs had slid off of the chicken by the time it got to me. The hollandaise was ok, but nothing special...it is supposed to be jalapeno hollandaise and just had maybe a slight spicy taste. The plate came with some dry looking beans that I did not eat and some potatoes that were nothing special. The BF got the pancakes, which were dry and tasted like they came from a package. I wouldn't say 'no' if I were invited back here, but I wouldn't come back here for breakfast on my own. I would like to come here for drinks one night as their patio is nice and they have a bocce ball court (which is awesome!), but I probably would pass on the food."}
{"text":"Fan-friggin-tastic!! SO, I met a petit blond young lady at work one evening/early morning. Miss Jami told me about this wonderful establishment. She shared a brief history of the place which really peaked my curiosity. She says she's a server there and that I must try it sometime. The sucker for a pretty girl that I am, I made a commitment to try it on Tuesday. I did.

I loved the antique car in the front as I approached. I love the overall character of the place from the outside. I walked in and waited for a moment for the host, and just took in the beautiful entryway. The smell of that old wood gives hint to the age of this great place. The host returned and greeted me. Kyle was pretty laid back and calm. He was a gentleman and very kind to spend a few moments talking to me. Being by myself, that was a bit of hospitality that I love to receive at restaurants. 

While taking up Kyles time my server came and asked me for my drink order. This lovely creature calls herself Mari. Mari was great. great personality, attentive and lovely as can be. While waiting for my food, I gawked around at this beautiful 1892 masterpiece. This restaurant has great ambiance, and I was thrilled to be dining in what was once a horse corral. In this corral was a beautiful fireplace, built in the 1930's, I'm told, and a huge water fountain. Very pretty. I love the paintings on the wall, one of Aunt Chillada herself and another awkward one, but fun, nonetheless. While nearing the end of my meal I greeted Daisha. While she was setting up the table next to me, I struck up a conversation with her, because that's what Thought Creep does when he dines alone. Daisha was fun to talk to and how awesome, she cleared my dirty plate. I love the team work. Uncommon in other restaurants. So a shout out to her. On my way out I was thanked by the Manager on duty, Dan. Kyle had offered me a History Tour of this massive place earlier but guests were starting to come in about 5:30 pm so I thought I'd take a rain check. Nope!!! An enthusiastic Dan offered to take me on the tour. He really knows his history of this place. I was impressed with, not only his knowledge of Aunt Chilada's but local mining history that played a roll of it's earlier success. 

Overall, I am really impressed. I am sad that Jami wasn't there, but I will be back another time. But TC, you ask? What about the food? I had the two entrée combination platter. A sucker for red meat and carnage, I chose the Machaca Taco and the Machaca enchilada. Served with shredded lettuce, lightly spiced refried beans with, what tasted like, a hint of fresh garlic, and a side of a seasoned baby angel hair pasta with bits of peas and carrots. Preceding my meal was home made flour tortilla chips and a delicious Salsa Fresca with baby black olives and other tasty bits of Mexi-goodness. And finally, I was impressed with the bottle of water. Served in a bottle that looks as old as the structure itself, this bottle was served extremely cold. The frostiness of the glass and light blue hue made this water appear refreshing. It was, at 110 degrees outside.  

I absolutely loved my experience here. From the moment I walked in to the time I left, my experience was a grand one. I will be back. I've told my friends back home in SoCal this is a must try, while visiting Lil ol' me. Until next time. Thank you Aunt Chilada's crew. Nicely done."}
{"text":"Hidden off the 51 & Glendale. Big place & big patio. Meh food. Chips & salsa ok. Skip the queso. Vegetarians BEWARE everything is made w/ meat. Beans AND noodle stuff. Ugh. Safe w/ grilled veggies. :("}
{"text":"The food is good but not great and the service can be questionable at times (especially in the bar), but it's such a great spot that I can overlook most of that.  Dog friendly patio, lots of outdoor space for nice weather days and the owners are wonderful people.  Bocce ball to pass the time while sipping on a nice Margarita.  The chips and salsa are a standout (not many places have flour tortilla chips) and the street tacos are a winner."}
{"text":"After my review is a History of Aunt Chilada's from their site- excerpted:

We went for lunch Saturday around 11:30am. A Group of 6 adults. My wife and I visiting from Denver, the  rest live in the area. My son recommended the place and we went with him, his wife and their Realtors. We thought the restaurant was nicely decorated, they have an area for bocce ball play, they say they are dog friendly. My wife liked the lit fireplace. When we arrived, there was only 2 or three other parties there for lunch.  When we left, they started filling up. Guess we need to leave a place more often to help the business :-)

What we Ordered:  Soft drinks for everyone.

Sour cream enchilada, El Pollo Fundido, Two item combo, Lunch Rellano, Spinach Chicken Enchilada, Chicken Avocado Salad, Caramel Flan, Sopapilla (nice they served the honey in a small bowl with a spoon), Caramel Flan

We also had chips and salsa. Chips were a combo of puffy and toasted. Salsa was mild. Over all thought they were okay. I happen to prefer crispy chips myself.

Everyone thought the food was delicious, I had the Chicken Avocado salad, it was okay. I'm not much on Mexican food, and usually it doesn't agree with me, so I ordered a neutral dish.  I've ordered sopapllia before, these were triangular in shape, and I thought over done, and more chewy then I remember from other places.  Flan tasted pretty good.  The place seems okay, the Realtors, said they felt it was good and would try the other one that's in the area to see how it was.  I don't think the other Aunt Chiladas is associated with this one.

I think it would be a good place, and would try the other dishes, as well as come back some evening to see how it is.  We came because my wife and I always enjoy visiting places with a history.

Below is History of Aunt Chiladas from their site abbreviated:

Shortly after the reluctant surrender of Geronimo (1886). Arizona was still an untamed territory, and Aunt Chilada's North Room was built on the foundation of the only general store serving the laborers working the Rico Mercury Mine... After a long day deep in the mines, the men emerged appearing somewhat inebriated and dreamy-eyed from inhaling the mercury fumes. As they walked down the dusty road to the general store, people were heard to remark, \"The men are back from The Dreamy Draw\".

Following the repeal of prohibition, Dave and Jesse Noble, the land's owners at the time were granted the first liquor license issued by the State of Arizona.

The store was later reopened as The Peek Steak House, getting its name ..from a uniquely placed and somewhat revealing window set in the ceiling of the bar (now the Tienda). Throughout the night, scantily clad women would climb into the attic and perform a hootchy-kootchy dance while patrons sneaked a peek through the window. 

This infamous bar and restaurant again found notoriety as it began a new life as George's Ole! George Cocherham was..a captain in the Phoenix Fire Department ... He used over 3,000 Santa Fe railroad ties, native stone from the area and a little help from his off-duty firefighter friends, George expanded the building to its present size. 

George made one other important addition, he purchased Arizona's Original smoker from Gentleman Jim's Barbeque at the corner of 16th and Oak Streets, and moved it to the Garden Patio where he not only smoked traditional meats and fowl but would also smoke game animals brought in by his customers....

The same tradition exists today. Aunt Chilada's still slow roasts a variety of delicious meats, chicken and vegetables over aged mesquite wood every day....

In the early 80's, Bob Gosnell bought the restaurant, renamed it Aunt Chilada's and made it a member of The Pointe's growing family of restaurants. It became known as \" The Hideaway\", by the locals... 

Ken was the overseer of food and beverage operations.... in January of 1995 Ken along with his partner, Lee Midtun, purchased the restaurant.

The Nagels - Ken, his wife Candice and their four daughters - now greet and serve guests."}
{"text":"This is the single worst restaurant I've ever been to, anywhere. From the looks of the other reviews, I must have caught them on a bad night, but I swear to God, the tacos I had there tasted like spoiled meat. My friend and I couldn't stomach more than one bite each and were not satisfied by the restaurants lack of concern over our complaints. 

We were made to pay for inedible food and no attempt was made to make things right... And for the record, I've got no problems with 'real' Mexican food-- street vendors and the worst Mexican joints I've been to from LA to Ensenada to Cozumel, are all better than this place."}
{"text":"Birthday party. 30 people. Buffet style.
I wouldn't go there again, but it was nice enough for that night. 
Food wasn't spectacular, and there wasn't any sort of view.
I guess it's a great place for a party, though."}
{"text":"What a great place to be! Everyone here treats you like family. The food is INCREDIBLE. I recommend the pineapple shrimp. JD and Tiffany and wonderful people who don't care about making money, but about building a family."}
{"text":"Went for our daughter birthday! What a disappointment and waste of $$ our table was lopsided almost spilled out drinks several times, wait for food was 45 minutes and the restaurant was empty with 1 other table besides ours, food was nothing special! We spoke to Marvin the evening manager about the wait for food and his response was sorry but we have a huge party. No excuse!  If you can manage a party and main dining room then you shouldn't be in business. Unfortunately we chose this place to eat because it was near our hotel! I plan to call the hotel to let them know not to recommend this place for their guest! I should have stayed to eat at the hotel and spend the extra $$ especially when celebrating a special occasion! I give this place zero stars!"}
{"text":"I have heard of this restaurant for years but this was my first visit. Beautiful outdoor setting reminiscent of cafes in Mexico. Salsa and chips were delicious and abundant. 
We were there for breakfast. Food was very disappointing. My over easy ordered eggs were scrambled, my ordered crisp bacon had barely seen a flame, and my English muffin was without butter.  It was not busy yet nothing arrived at our table warmer than room temperature. Cold potatoes and refried beans do not make breakfast special. Nothing rose above the level of bland. 
Hope to try it again, perhaps lunch or dinner in hopes that it is more of their expertise and/or they have chef that is more experienced and/or is committed to tasty, hot, decent food."}
{"text":"Came in to unwind after work and have a drink. Madison was great and very attentive to me despite being very busy and having a full house on her hands. I'll definitely be back and would recommend the food and service to anyone. Thanks Madison!"}
{"text":"Forgive me Aunt Chiladas! I`m so ashamed to admit that I live in your neighborhood, have been coming here forever and just now writing a review! Better late than never!
Ok what I like about this place: Best Happy Hour around- drink specials and free buffet! On Fridays they have live music and it gets packed. On beautiful weather the patio areas are great to be hanging out!
Sundays- awesome brunch with a chocolate fountain.
Margaritas- frozen, on the rocks, top shelf, etc- love them here!
Chips and salsa- love the flaky, crispy chips here! Not a real fan of the chunky salsa( I like mine hot!) but you get two kinds- the chunky and a red mole style which is spicer so me likey!
Grreat  place for groups!!! And the patio is dog friendly!
For Cinco De Mayo- come here! All day live music fest!!
ps, the inside is more intimate for dinner, I am a fan of the sour cream and chicken enchiladas! I love coming here!!"}
{"text":"Loved the casual atmosphere and the food was yummy! A park across the street so the kids can play after"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Aunt Chilada's since the mid 80's.  Always a reliable place for food and drink. The layout is ideal for large social meetups. Tonight was exceptional. Sarah (Sara?) the bartender was the best ever! Completely attentive and on the ball. Respectful and friendly. Amazing ability to multitask and not leave anybody waiting. Even remembered my name! 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The flour tortilla chips are a nice change from traditional corn. Other than that, the food is ok. The pomegranate margarita was tasty but overpriced, as was the food."}
{"text":"On Sunday night I had a great experience at Aunt Chiladas. Not only were my fajitas amazing but our server Mario was also very gracious and took good care of my party. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in Phoenix looking for good Mexican food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Two words: chocolate fountain. Two more words: TORTILLA CHIPS. Let me elaborate. FLOUR tortilla chips. They're incredible. Like, can't stop eating them incredible. They're like little triangles of heaven melting on your tongue. Salsa, guac, hot sauce, it's doesn't matter! I eat them plain! By the handful! I actually dipped the tortilla chips IN the chocolate fountain.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. The decor at Aunt Chilada's is rainbow cactus chic. Not a dull table or view from anywhere in the restaurant. The service is top notch. You can tell a lot of people have been working here a while which makes me believe they treat the staff well. The plates of food are large, complete with refried beans, pico de gallo, lettuce and cheese. All of which you can scoop up with the TORTILLA CHIPS FROM GOD.

But really, the food here is incredible. The chocolate fountain is on Sundays for brunch. And the tortilla chips are all the damn time. It seems a bit off the beaten path, but well worth the drive. It is a must-go every time I'm in the area. Go forth and salivate."}
{"text":"My 1st impression of the outside was unclean, cluttered and a little quirky but I was willing to try it out because of the great reviews I've heard. We came in to fast service and a  welcoming staff however the food was crappy!!! My husband ( who will eat anything) ordered the fish tacos took one bite and refused to finish it! He's not the type to complain, so in stead he walked away disgusted and starving. With majority of the meals they are served with fedio (Mexican spaghetti) which was flat out horrible. Bland and just strait up weird!  I don't recommend this place. At all..."}
{"text":"If you love good old chips and salsa to start off your meal, you will be in absolute heaven.  I am not usually a big fan of fried stuff, but they have a crisp fluffy taste like the bottom of a tostada as their main chips selection.  I felt like I can almost eat a basketful!

I ordered chicken fajitas.  I have had better seasoned fajitas, but it came with a lot of good salsa and guac to enhance some lack of flavor.  

The overall ambiance is excellent here because you feel you are in a \"casa\" than more of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and building.  Fantastic homemade ginger ale.  They have a fun trivia league on Wednesday.  The service is a bit slow when they get super busy, but the staff are really nice.  Their chihuahua contest in the summer is pretty fun as well."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Very cute atmosphere. I definitely recommend it. I came with a very big group today, everyone around me loved their food. I had to send the soup back because if was luke-warm. However, they were very quick to make up for the mishap, and the service was excellent. My friends were all thrilled with their meals. The tortillas before the meal are excellent as well."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Hilton Squaw peak, the employees highly recommended Aunt Chiladas. We  went over that evening and we were super hungry, grandkids were with us along with my wife and daughter in law. Our waiter was TANNER wow he was really awesome. We had food questions and he explained everything in great detail. He was very attentive, knowledgeable, friendly. We gave our orders and then the food arrived quickly!!!!!!! Wow it was fantastic, we loved the flour tortilla chips, salsa was handmade, I had the carnitas tacos, grandson had fish tacos (great) grand daughter had the machaca chimi, grammy had the machaca tacos, all dishes were excellent. Nearly all of there food is scratch made.A couple nights later we went back again, TANNER wasn't working but the food was great again, svc was good. We will be back again soon,"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch yesterday and order and bean and cheese burrito. Food was good and so was the service at the bar. You even get free chips and salsa thrown in with your meal when you take out. Definitely a quick place to grab lunch and head back into the office."}
{"text":"I give solid 3 stars. Thursday night group of 6.slow in the beginning from host to food. We had to put together our own table open mic area.waoted about 5-10 min on drinks another on menus.SErver was very friendly just think it tough on 1 server to work a bunch of people. There was a 10 top, 3, 4 and few others.the salsa was really good.the chips where mix flour and corn witch I like.i had shrimp taco thinking it would be breaded however no breading witch didn't set well with a flour tortilla as taco. Rice and beans really good everyone else food looked good but mine was avg. I recommend breading the shrimp and maybe a Chipotle mayo sauce"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fun; food no different than Mexican restaurants elsewhere (even Boston - Borders Cafe has better food). The chips might have been the worst we have had. We were expecting more given all the hype. And all the other reviews. Since this seems to be a chain, maybe we just had a bad experience at this specific one."}
{"text":"This seriously is my new favorite place. I can't believe I've never been there before. The place is HUGE and the service was amazing. Tiffany the manager is so personable and will love sharing the history of the restaurant. So cool.  Can't wait to go back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"For my money, it's the best Mexican food in Phoenix. Wonderful outdoor patio and terrific service staff. I always get the seafood enchilada. It is absolutely the best!"}
{"text":"we got here right at opening.
sticky table.
broken table..the rounded edges were resting on my lap as opposed to being tucked up.
(one of the staff said all the tables are like that then sat us at an operational table that was teetering obscenely)
mimosa was maybe 3 Oz of OJ with a blip of champagne.
the tequila sunrise......no...just. no. nooooooo.
I asked for a side of avocado and they gave me hard slices of non ripe avocado.

they serve shots of water.

the chips and salsa were ok.
the beans were good.
 place was cute
food mediocre 
staff....they are apathetic.  if you work here you must have no passion for your job......

the restaurant fountains are dirty...no one knows what shock is I guess.  and this green dirty water is accessible to kids and close to people's tables.

will I come back?
Hell to the N. O."}
{"text":"We frequent the Phoenix area once or twice a year, and Aunt Chilada's is usually a stop for us.

We love sitting outside in the patio area. It used to be nicer, now they have a bocci ball court and the tables and chairs seem a bit worn. They immediately try to upsell you their premium margarita because it's a better deal, but in the end, it's expensive. I'm a $2.99 rita fan @ Via Delosantos or Mi Patio.

The food is quite good and of course, portions are huge. The only thing is they serve this weird pasta side dish instead of rice. Bizarre.

Always have good servers and everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"We were cautious given the lower rating with good reason.  Environment great.  Food spotty.  My meal was dead cold and waitress did not come back for 15 minutes.  When we ordered two sauces they showed up after we finished AND they had the courage to charge $2.50 a piece.  Not sure if I was supposed to eat them with a spoon.  

Chips and salsa not good. 

I think they get business from the large hotel but repeat customers might be hard to come by.  

Many choices for better Mexican."}
