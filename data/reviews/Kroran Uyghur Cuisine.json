{"text":"Loved the Quruq Qorima, and the Chöchüre uyghur tortellini soup. Also worth getting the Turkish-style tea. I missed out on the göshnan, want to try those next time!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Uyghur cuisine so I don't have any baseline to compare it to. I found the food really oily for my liking. The flavours made me enjoy the dish until I remembered how oily it is. I will definitely come back to try their dumplings and soups."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our lunch at Kroran today! My children and I had the Unnche Lengmen (one for me and one for the boys to share). It was great! My husband had Lengmen, which he said was also very tasty! We are vegetarian and they were happy to accommodate us by leaving the meat out (although they weren't sure it would taste as good!). All in all, a lovely place to try some authentic Uyghur food!"}
{"text":"They haven't updated their menu, I'm pretty sure, unless they did some super minor details. They certainly didn't expand their menu options. I got the polu this time (stir fried lamb and carrots steamed with rice). It was fatty lamb pieces and the lamb fat mixed into the rice. It was delicious. The price was alright, but once again, not quite right for their neighborhood. I'm surprised at how many people were inside at lunch on a weekday though. That's hopeful. They were all Mandarin speaking though."}
{"text":"Good quality food , legmen and kebab is delicious  Will definitely comeback next time when I visit Toronto"}
{"text":"Went here with 4 friends on a Sunday evening. Was my first time trying Uyhgur food so I didn't know what to expect but was excited to try. The restaurant is relatively small and can seat about 26 people. It was clean and the decor was nice. The menu is only 1 page which I liked because it really simplifies your decision.   The prices were reasonable; ended up costing $24/person. The portion sizes seemed small though. We ordered a 2nd round of food after realizing this.   Most of the dishes we ordered were tasty.   Lamb skewers were juicy and aromatic from the cumin. Wished it came with more naan.   Polu lamb carrot rice was great. A decent size for 1 person, not so much sharing between 5 hungry people.   Fried beef kebab tasted similar to the lamb skewers. Possibly similar seasoning, but was noticeably more bland.   Lengmen handmade noodles with lamb was flavourful. I particularly liked the slightly chewy texture of the noodles."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time to try out this new restaurant and had some decent expectations.  First of all, they sat us on a table that had used utensils and plates/glasses on it, and they never cleaned it. We had a big table so it was just pushed to one side. They didn't bring us any utensils/water until we had to ask. The food came out extremely slow, people who got there after us got their food before us (same dishes!). The two waiters seemed uninterested/rude towards us and never came to check on us once. One of my friends choked on a food piece and needed water but it took them more than 5 minutes to bring us a glass of water.   Food was mediocre, seemed under-flavored and seasoned, but could be just the type of food it was.  Needless to say, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Decent clean restaurant. Serving Halal food. Family Run. Totally worth going. Will recommend anytime.  Not very pricey either."}
