{"text":"Finally, they got it right.

I'm on record as saying that I didn't care all that much for Ten Restaurant by the end of its lifespan, and when I heard that a group of investors/benefactors had come onboard to reopen the place into another restaurant, I was very leery. A chance conversation with a patron outside another restaurant reinforced my opinion, as this man told me he wasn't very impressed with the experience.

Thank God I was able to judge the place for myself - and I was very impressed.

After months of hemming and hawing with reasons not to go, I finally bit the bullet and went for dinner along with a buddy, and the experience was great. While this is largely the same space and table setup, it's clear that the management has addressed the two key complaints - the service and the food.

Our waiter was very attentive and constantly checking up on us, asking if we needed anything. I ended up settling for the Port Burger, which came piled high with cheddar cheese, thick banana peppers and mushrooms, which made for a delightfully-spicy taste that set it apart from any other burger I've had in the last year. My friend settled on a half-pound of wings and also reported that he was impressed with the flavour and presentation.

While I was always a fan of Ten's reuben sandwiches, I wasn't keen on a lot of the menu items and found their serving sizes to be too small for my tastes. That complaint has been largely addressed in this iteration of the restaurant - the burger I had was much bigger than I expected, though the fries (plentiful as they were) felt like they were missing salt or something else. As Kris U mentioned in his review, the taste was a bit similar to the nearby Burger's Priest, though the presentation definitely adds an extra \"wow\" factor that isn't present at the other establishment.

I found the space itself to be a little more quaint and homespun than before. This is definitely a space that lends itself well to quiet hangouts and get-togethers, though I found it a bit distracting at the end of the night when the live music started up. Maybe that's just my \"old man yelling at clouds\" mentality seeping in.

Regardless, The Port House was a fantastic experience, and I'm eager to go back and try some more of the other menu options.

They finally restored some luster to the center of the village. The wait was worth it."}
{"text":"Wow. Apparently, the folks of Port Credit have been so obsessed with the other shiny new dining options in the area that they didn't notice the restaurant formally known as TEN has undergone a total renovation and rebrand to become The Port House Social Bar & Kitchen. It's been revamped since the end of May and it's only getting added to Yelp and reviewed by yours truly today.

Take it from me, this IS a place you NEED to visit as it incorporates the high-quality delicious food of its predecessor with the popular rustic vibe of current restaurants. It's not at the level of local options where barn board and Edison bulbs prevail, but it takes that inspiration and makes it sophisticated so that everyone from young and hip to mature (and hip) can enjoy.

I was here for a quick lunch yesterday, and despite the suggestions of our server (who knew the menu inside and out), I knew the best way to evaluate a restaurant was to take something basic to execute and try it. I always find that if a business can execute the basics well (like an egg) there is a good chance they can execute their menu well.

I went with their THE PORT Burger, made with: aioli, tomato-bacon relish, old credit cheddar (the cheese is infused with local old credit brewery beer), portobello mushroom, onion ring,
banana peppers served with a side of fries. The burger came in good time and was served on a wood slab plate.

I ate the fries while they were hot and they were perfect, thicker cut, soft inside with a good fry on the outside with a good crisp. I don't eat fries all that often anymore but these were excellent, I ate them without any ketchup at all, perfect straight up.

I purposely delayed eating the burger, because I wanted to give it my undivided attention - smartest thing ever. Soft, juicy, waves of flavour, and a slight crisp on the burger pattie giving me the impression that it was hand pressed on a flat top entirely or in part. Admittedly it smelt oddly like a big mac but had the taste of early days Burgers Priest burger (but about 3 times the size). Excellent! Maybe it's because I haven't had a burger in while, but this was one of the best burgs I've had in a long time. It was perfect in every way.

I didn't try their beverage menu but I'm looking forward to returning for dinner and drinks soon so I can get a full experience. Until then...

{"text":"Came here last night with my two girlfriends before going to an escape room. The location is right by the water, so it does smell outside, but the area is great. They have free parking located underground. We had made reservations for 630 but got there for 6. However they were able to sit us right away as it wasn't very busy. However it did pick up as the night went on. Our waitress was very attentive and kind, and did check in quite often. We started with the buffalo cauliflower and it was freaking amazing. As far as I'm concerned, that can't be healthy with how delicious it is. For main, I had the Cajun chicken Alfredo. I did like this, but you could really taste a lot of butter in the sauce. My gf got the margherita pizza which I took a slice of, and it was pretty good.  Very thin slices, and with the chili oil on top, it made it better. We ended with a brownie which was pretty hot, with ice cream melting on top, but nothing out of the ordinary. It's reasonably priced I feel, and I was pretty happy with my experience. I would return if I find myself in the area again."}
{"text":"I'm sorry? Now that it is not TEN any more the food has gone downhill and apparently so has the service .

The blonde waitress started off so nice. But as the night went on, things changed. The medium rare steak that i ordered was given to the wrong table and that person has taken a bite of it. I had to now wait another 20min for a fresh one. The new one came and it was not medium rare but well done. When we told the waitress, I kid you not, she pulled out her phone with FLASH and checked the steak whilst asking 'are you sure it's well done' pardon my French but WTF!. 

Anyhow. We cancelled the order as I was afraid my new new steak would be spit on.

Will not come for dinner again."}
{"text":"The Port House is a good place for a meal.  We went there with another couple to simply have a mean and chat. The food was good and they have a decent, albeit small, wine list. Since this is the season for Christmas parties there was one being hosted on the lower level where we were sitting so it was louder than it would be normally in the restaurant. But, we still had a good time and I would recommend this place and go back again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Starter: Ahi tuna wonton. Very flavourful, nice mix of ingredients with the sesame. The wonton skin was a little hard. This appetizer can be improved by using the wonton and shaping it like a cup, as it was hard to pick up when it was displayed and lay out in the form of a T patterns along the plate.

Main: I've ordered the miso salmon, I find it a little too moist and the centre can be marinated more. The portion of the rice to salmon, the rice was a bit too much. The green onion on top of the rice can be sliced thinner.

I've also tried the Port burger with garlic aioli, tomato bacon relish, old credit cheddar, portobello mushroom, onion ring, banana pepper. It was tasty and comparable to venues that only specializes in burger. I prefer the burger over my salmon.

Service: great service, after our appetizer, our waitress helped us clear all the plates and provided us with new set of utensils.

Ambiance: feels like being at Orlando, nice vibrant ambiance. Pretty packed on a Saturday evening. 

Will come back when I am in the area to try other dishes."}
{"text":"What can I say? I'm super impressed! My friends made a reservation for 6:30 on Saturday night and we were seated in a private area by the back. I really like how the windows make the place open up. We could have nice discussions with one another and still be listening to the nice background music. 

The waitress we had was very attentive and friendly. I wish I had gotten her name but she was absolutely amazing! 

I ordered the fish and chips and it did not disappoint. The coleslaw was creamy and light, not too vinegar-y or overpowering. It's probably one of the best coleslaws I've tasted. I also ordered the tuna poke wonton which is finely diced tuna sashimi with some fresh vegetables (cucumber and other veggies I can't remember now lol) on wonton crisps. It was delicious and the serving size was perfect to share with one or two other people. The only disappointing thing was that one of the other servers who was helping bring over the food had dropped my French fries and never brought back a replacement. My server (the girl I mentioned at the beginning) made sure I got one of the cakes comped in exchange for missing the fries, so that was very nice of her. I appreciated the gesture a lot because my meal was quite disappointing without the \"chips\" part. 

I really wanted to try some of the other dishes because they had some Korean elements to it like a Korean hot sauce called kojujang. It always intrigued me when other places makes fusion recipes with my cultures food (im Korean, if you couldn't guess). 

When I asked our waitress to bring out cakes for my friends, she was great with the timing and discreet as well (its always nice when the cake comes out as a surprise). 

All in all, I can't wait to come back again and try some other items on the menu! Great place."}
{"text":"Went to a Yelp event with some food samples and wine tasting but also stayed afterwards for a full meal. The place form what I have been told was recently renovated and it does look great.  The staff are super friendly and the upstairs area looks amazing with a private feel.

When I arrived, there is parking outside as well as underground.  Being concerned that there is a 45 min time limit on ground level, I decided to take advantage of the free underground parking with spots labelled with a green P. 

Given that it was a Monday, the place was not too busy but there is enough space inside as well as the patio until it gets too cold to sit outside. As for the food, the samples were great with a unique twist. When I order the salmon after the event, it lacked a bit of creativity with respect to the presentation and i was not blown away by the taste.  Perhaps, it was not one of their signature items that were part of the food samples at the event. 

When I do pass by the area, I will definitely make an effort to return."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 6 people on a Friday night for my birthday.  though the place was busy, my reservation was on time, however you cannot make reservation for the patio b/c it was the first summer weather night.  We asked to be moved to patio once a table opened up.  by the time we got our first drink orders, they were able to move us outside.  Happy about this :)
Service- 8/10 -they didn't go above and beyond. Sister is vegan and server didn't know what on the menu are vegan. however they were prompt and server was friendly and prompt
Food/flavour- 8/10 ordered 3 pizzas, 1 calamari, 1 lettuce wrap, 1 lettuce wrap w/ tofu, sweet potato fries, shots, bottle of wine, sangria and beers.  everything was pretty delicious. 
Price- 7.5/10 portions are fair but you pay for the atmosphere. bottles of wine and beer were more than other places. 
ok variety. sangria was small size for the price. 
Atmosphere- 8.5/10 great! especially if you're lucky enough to get a patio seating.  crowd is mid 20's to mature.  the place turns into a club (indoors) after 10 or 11.  we didn't stay but the music was good.  Top 40's"}
{"text":"Good drinks amazing staff, and the live music they have is unbelievable. I recommend this place to anyone who loves to drink in a relaxing causal environment."}
{"text":"This was only a fair experience for a midday lunch. I had the Caesar Salad with Chicken so you really can't mess that one up. My lunch colleague ordered the soup of the day. It was served cold...the server took it back & then...forgot about us. Took her 20 minutes & us reminding her then she picked up the soup. The worse part is the place was quiet!! One last point before I move on, the menu was very limited & a little boring. Doubt I'll go back there."}
{"text":"We came here for a business dinner party, and there were about 50 of us. They finally took our order at around 8:30-45, but first app arrived at 9:30. Then as the main arrived, my wife asked for medium rare but they only brought up medium well, so they skipped over her. It ended up EVERYONE got their food and her steak....almost blue steak instead of medium rare....arrived when most people already finished theirs. By this time is already 10 pm and their \"night life\" time has begun and we can no longer hear each other even when we are sitting beside each other and the speaker over us turned off (the reading on my phone was still over 94 dB).
Okay, their service was good (if they served us water right from the get-go would have been \"very good\").
Food wise....the apps were good, but the main...the steak was way undercook.... of the steak was medium rare, but  was still rare. The mashed potatoes was the most grainy that I have EVER tasted....actually I'd have to get over the overpowering butter before the feeling of eating sand. The Salmon was over cooked as it was just dry. The funny thing was they gave me five halves of Brussels Sprouts with my salmon, but my wife got almost five whole sprouts.
So, one of her colleagues told us she loves this place as the food is always good....I guess we may give them another try when it's just the two of us.
If eardrums-popping music is not your thing, come here early and make sure they finish serving you before 10 pm. Otherwise...bring earplugs."}
{"text":"Just okay. 
Came here for my birthday dinner. Called to make reservations but no reservation was needed as it wasn't that busy. Upon first entrance the atmosphere is nice. It's a bar lounge style, slightly dim with carpentry finishes. It's newly renovated from the old ten spot. 
The menu is small. You have the options of a couple apps being calendar I wings and nachos. For entrees you have the choice of Pizza, steak, burgers, pasta or salad. There's like 2 chicken options a rib option and a sea food option but nothing that stood out. Even with minimal option we would prefer a stronger menu with chef recommended ingredients. I ordered the Cajun chicken linguine ($21) and my boyfriend ordered the butter chicken ($24). 
My pasta was okay. Pretty standard. Just linguine with Parmesan alfredo saige and seasoned chicken.  Chicken was seasoned well pasta was more blan. Butter chicken was okay. Nothing authentic- more of a starter butter chicken for people who don't like too much flavour. Chicken came separate from the rice and naan which I liked. 
Our server was jay. He was okay but didn't seem to be too focussed on our table. He forgot numerous requests such as bringing us refills, and asking for the dessert menu on numerous occasions. He didn't come around very frequently to check in just to take our order and to remove be our plates and get us our bill. 
Overall this wasn't the best experience and it wasn't the worst. Everything seemed to be pretty basic. Pricing was standard. Food was just okay. May be back in the future but wouldn't have high expectations."}
{"text":"Look I'm not gonna lie - I didn't come here for dinner, but my friends and I stumbled in here at around 11 on a Friday night for drinks and dancing. I was a little..... tired.... but from what I remember, our waitress was really great, and the drinks we had were great too! Something else that also stuck out to me was how clean the bathrooms were - the entire place had a really great atmosphere. I'd definitely come back here again (hopefully I'd actually be able to eat there next time, too!)"}
{"text":"Excellent ambience, great service and quality food makes it a great place to spend the evening with friends and family.
My steak was cooked to perfection.
The politeness and attentiveness of the staff was very impressive.
Overall a good place
Much recommended"}
