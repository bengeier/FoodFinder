{"text":"Okay my wife wanted to try this spot a friend recommended. We ventured out to Phoenix to give it a shot. We parked in the back to walk around to the front entrance. Once we entered we were greeted by the friendly staff. The family ordered multiple tacos & a quesadilla. I was busy on the phone with a friend while taking a bite of my Carne Asada taco...I had to immediately hang up & take another bite then made my way to the salsa bar. Lots of variety of toppings to your liking. I kid you not. The food was so good that we placed a second order. The staff asked if it were our first time & they graciously gave us a bean & cheese quesadilla which was good as well. Overall great ppl & awesome food. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had the Carne Asada burrito. They let you add what ever you want and then wrap it up for you. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent carne asada burrito. Tortilla was what you find in Mexico, not at the chains. Very warm and friendly owners/staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am totally thinking this place must write its own 5 star review. This place was horrible!!!!!!!
Microwaved my nasty beans. Carne asada torta was a big joke. The micro-thin fat riddled \"ribeye\" steak was 1/8 maybe thick and about 30% smaller than torta bun.  The Barbacoa could have been good if it did not have so much salt. What's really bad is I am a salt hound and it was too salty for me. Lord help some that doe not do salt.  I cannot understand how this place could get such a high rating..NO WAY!!!  Won't be back ever again!"}
{"text":"Ok. So you know what I'm gonna say. The Carne Asadas were so good. I got the burrito with everything on it. So much flavor and the beef was so tender. I'm from out of town and needed a place to stop and eat before we went to Sedona and this was the closest and highest rated restaurant. I'm so lucky I found this place! If I'm ever in town I will def be back!"}
{"text":"We're coming from out of state and thought we'd try it.... And it was the best Mexican food my friends and I ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Si, me gusta. In a strangely meta experience, your reviewer went to the aforementioned taqueria as part of my colleagues' emerging lunchtime tradition, informally known as Taco Tuesdays. First of all, there's parking adjacent to the building, which is awesome; second, it is easy to get in and order. You can smell the smoky grilling beef of the carne asada. All you need to determine is which of the tasty meats you want and in what form of tortilla, corn or wheat flour, do you want it served on. It doesn't really matter, everything we tried was good: we tried a few of the head meats -- cabeza, cachete -- very delicious and tender, the cheek meat was possessed of a big beefy flavor; the carne asada was generous and very delicious. My colleague enjoyed the frijoles, which she claimed were the best frijoles she'd ever eaten. The salsa bar was well stocked with fresh produce, and had, in particular, a salsa roja, made with arbol chiles, clearly labeled as hot. Readers should be forewarned this is a bit of a misnomer: it's very hot. It's called memory sauce for a reason: you'll remember it later on. Service was personable and helpful; the tacos come out not all at once, but piece-wise, but, it means you'll get up a few times to get the rest of your order as it's filled."}
{"text":"Came in from Atlanta and this is the best Mexican food I have every had. It was the real deal and the people were so  nice.  I will definitely be back before I leave."}
{"text":"Great food and even better people! Carne Asada and Turkey Barbacola tacos were terrific!"}
{"text":"Friendly, pleasant and very welcoming staff. I needed that, being a truck driver who was 1,600 miles from home.

And the food was really good! Excellent service! :)

Thanks to the staff.

{"text":"Friend recommended this place and decided to check it out! Variety of meat options for your liking and you can fill your burrito with the toppings they provide you and they'll offer to roll it for you too! Worth the $10 you spend on one burrito. The employees checked up on us a couple times to make sure we were enjoying the meal. Best restaurant to stop at first when coming to Phoenix"}
{"text":"Great, authentic tacos. I've tried almost every variety of tacos on the menu amd they were all superb. My favs were asada, cachete, and salsa verde.

Great prices and friendly owner"}
{"text":"Best quesadilla I have ever had!!!! We are visiting from the sf/Bay Area and found this place on yelp. Prices are really good the food is amazing and the staff is awesome. Family owned spot and I felt right at home. If you want bomb mexican food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great AUTHENTIC Mexican food. Don't come here if you're looking for guac and sour cream and cheese tacos...come here if you are looking for authentic Mexican food. We thoroughly enjoyed the food and the staff was awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped in when I had some meetings by the AZ capitol. Nice fine. The staff was very nice and the food was great. I went with tacos and appreciated the toppings bar. Good authentic street tacos."}
{"text":"This place has the best carne asada. The meat is seasoned perfectly and tender and juicy. The corn tortilla I chose to have it on was delicious. They have a salsa bar that you take your food over to and choose toppings. I chose cilantro, pickled spicy onion and green salsa on my first one and pico on my second one (yes, I went and ordered seconds). I HIGHLY recommend making a stop to try a few tacos here. I also had the barbacoa pork taco. O.M.G. it was ah-ma-zing! Its juices were so flavorful and the meat was perfectly cooked and soft. I wanted to drink the drippings from my plate. But, that wouldn't have been lady like. The service was very pleasant. Everyone was kind and wished us a good night. Even the cook said good bye as we left.  I will be going back at every possible chance I get!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING something as simple as a steak quesadilla was delicious.  They have a great salsa bar with fresh limes, tomatoes, salsa..etc So good that after we ate we order another round of food all over again. Visiting from California and by far the best Mexican food I have ever had.  So sad I can't get this all the time but now there is a great reason to come back to Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Visited with our 10 month old daughter when on vacation based on yelp reviews. Wasn't sure what to expect and we were PLEASANTLY surprised! service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious! My husband got three different tacos and I got the Barbados burrito. Both were wonderful. We also got a cheese quesadilla for our daughter who powered through the whole thing. Clearly homemade tortillas. So yum! Only wish they had margaritas to wash it all down with!"}
{"text":"If you want amazing authentic Mexican food, this is the place to go. The carne asada is one of the best in the valley, and there are no words for how delicious the green chile beef is. To top it all off, their salsas are delicious!"}
{"text":"Best burrito place in Phoenix. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. Get your burrito (all the meat choices are delish!) and put whatever you want in it from the condiment bar then give it back to them and they roll it for you. Yum!"}
{"text":"JUST DO IT! Everything was delicious! I don't think you can go wrong no matter what you order! Service is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The ambiance is a little noisy for my taste and the service is a little disorganized (when your food is ready you take it to a condiments station to load it up and then, if you have a burrito, you take it back to the counter so they can wrap it for you) however the food was really good. We had Carne asada and pork barbacoa, cabeza and lengua, and all of it was really good. My husband went back for seconds. When a slight mix up occurred (we got a barbacoa taco when we ordered the carne asada) , the manager asked if we would like to keep it while he got us the right order a classy move. 

Also, the red salsa... Super delicious and super spicy. My husband loves spicy salsa and is often underwhelmed with claims of spicy salsa. This one however, fried his palate. We will definitely be coming back for more. 

5 people eating (2 kids)  and the total came out to $45ish."}
{"text":"1st time  there  was small nothing  fancy but good atmosphere and great food . Very helpful and friendly staff . Were very quick to get food to us at the time we went . Would recommend this  place to anyone looking for some good tacos or burritos."}
{"text":"We pulled off the freeway for a quick bite and were thrilled to have found Taqueria El Chino. If you are in the area. GO!!  The owner or manager was hilarious and everyone set a friendly tone.  The steak tacos were awesome and the chicken too!  Loved going to the bar and outing on all my own taco toppings.  Really great, authentic food.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Best carne asada burritos we have had in phoenix so far, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am completely in love with this place! They not only make the best tacos and burritos but el chino beans are to die for! I now have a true food addiction to this place and go a few times a week. They also offer turkey and chicken options if you don't eat red meat, which is a plus!! You leave craving more and without the feeling your pores are oozing grease. This is quality food and cooked/seasoned to perfection. I look forward to each visit and their staff is always so welcoming and accommodating. This place is a MUST stop and so reasonably priced as well"}
{"text":"Frickin bomb. MUST GO TO for top if the line Mexican food. Friendly business love that about any business! Gotta go back soon lol."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!! Barbacoa was a little salty but still good, nice and tender!  Red chile burrito was the the hit! Love this place recommend it to all!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meat. The tacos were outstanding. I also liked that I could add my own toppings. Look out for that red sauce though!"}
{"text":"Grilled chicken breast & shredded beef tacos are so good. Worth the trip over. 

I'd loved it there was more mild salsa options and fish tacos."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious, but such an understatement. Tacos and the burritos are very flavorful, the quality of the meat and the variety of toppings you can pick and choose from to put on your food is just mouthwatering. If you want QUALITY on Mexican food, this place is it. They will be on PBS channel this Monday. Show them some love! Because it IS a 5 star spot. Hands down."}
{"text":"This place was ok. The young guy with the facial piercings doing the food was pretty rude both times I had to interact with him. The salsa bar was very good but you only get two tiny containers for the salsa. The wait for our to-go food was super long and we put our order in way before the lunch rush. The carne asada wasn't cut like street tacos it was long strips of meat. My coworker liked it but I more than likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Best tacos we've had in AZ. Takes me back to tacos at a truck in Oakland with Dad as a kid.

Flavorful and savory carne asada. The place is spotlessly clean (so much so I had my doubts about the legit-ness of the food), super fresh salsa bar.

The owners are so warm and welcoming, taking time to chat. 

Loved the whole experience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"omg yummy! love the food. service is great. thanks jackie you made my day! the owner is fun and very personable. i have to checkout the new location. rice and beans are sooo good!"}
{"text":"El chino taqueria is so hospitable! From the moment you walk in you feel like you are in a family home. The tacos were so good. It honestly doesn't matter what kind, just get some!  The owner, Raphael aka, the chino, was very helpful with recommendations and so friendly. The salsa bar was so fresh and had lots of options for toppings. Best taco experience yet!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in AZ!!! You won't find better carne asada. Don't forget the chino bean quesadilla!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican style tacos and burritos around! Mexican restaurants come a dime a dozen, with few who spare no expense for quality, fresh ingredients, Taquerias El Chino is no exception. From the moment you take a first bite,  you can be sure you're getting the best cuts of meat and the freshest cuts of vegetables. Try this place once, and you'll be sure to make Taquerias El Chino, a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and staff is super friendly. Thanks to my friend Angie for the recommendation !!!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome and customer service is top notch.
I will always come here when I'm craving Mexican food"}
{"text":"Great place to go have dinner, drinks and listen to live music.Friendly people, and if you feel like dancing this is the place."}
{"text":"This place is so good! The tacos are amazing, big cuts of meat, steak that's cooked perfectly and tortillas that melt in your mouth. Coupled with the BEST retried beans I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Don't think twice if your looking for Mexican Food, El Chino has the best Carne Asada Tacos in the city w/ fresh salsa bar!

Tell them David sent you! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"best carne asada burrito I've ever eaten. Great food. Clean restaurant. Kind staff. A gem!"}
{"text":"By far the best damn taco I've ever had !!! This place is awesome everything taste amazing !!!! Especially the seafood taco !!! And shredded beef!!! Area is a bit rough but worth it for the food!!"}
{"text":"1st time here.  My husband and I stopped for lunch today and this place is really kept up. I ordered the carne asada torta and man was it very filing, I had a hard time finishing it.  My husband ordered the same with 2 carne asada tacos on the side.  They have a salsa bar with fresh pico, cilantro, limes, salsa, and onions you can top your plate with.

The carne asada was so delicious!  I work near the capitol and already can't wait to come back and try the other items on the menu.

Prices are really reasonable and the customer service is awesome.  They walked up to our table and offered us refills, boxes to go, and even take our empty plates. If you are in the area this is a must stop."}
{"text":"Great customer service!! An even better salsa bar and the food was delicious!!! 

Definitely recommend this taco place!!"}
{"text":"Went to El Chino on a Monday for a birthday lunch. None of us had been before but learned the do's from the CHECK PLEASE review. I ordered the chicken cheese quesadilla and a side of beans. I guess the cashier didn't hear the chicken part of my order so I only received a cheese quesadilla. That would have been ok if they used a bigger tortilla, but they only used a 5 inch tortilla so it was a bit lacking in size. However it was good as were the beans. Several others ordered the green chili and they all said it was great. It was very fast service and everyone was friendly. Next time I will order the burrito so I don't leave hungry like I do when I leave a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best hole in the wall Mexican restaurant I've ever eaten at. very authentic and tasty! the food was delicious and the owner was amazing and helpful to us. my first time and he suggested the carne asada and it was the best carne I've ever eaten. I felt as if I was at home. if you're looking to eat homemade Mexican food, this is the spot!!!!! well organized and very clean!! thank you for your amazing customer service, I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Best Authentic restaurant I've experienced. Was in town from Atlanta and tried it. I must go back before I leave!!!"}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing!  Friendly staff and really good food.  Just a note that when they say the salsa is HOT they are not kidding.   We also had their soup and it was really flavorful.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Visited today with my wife after a long hike in South Mountain Park. Wonderful greeting from the owner sincere and friendly. We had amazing barbacoa puerco (Pork), barbacoa res (Beef), Cabeza (braised meat from the head), carne asada (Ribeye) and then finally 2 bean burritos to go. Wow absolutely the best mexican food I have found in entire city. I do reviews maybe once or twice a year. We will be back as everything was fresh and flavorful and overall very clean. Give this place a try there is a reason they have 5 stars and 30 plus reviews. Side note we visit Mexican restaurants about 2 times a week and very rarely go to the same place twice. This place is going to be on my travel routes weekly. I did learn a little bit about where they source their tortillas and I also get mine from there and know how hard they can be to get ahold of."}
{"text":"Awesome, fresh, homesyle Mexican food.
Barbacoa was wonderfully spiced and very tender.
Lengua taco was super tender and great beefy flavor.
Pork burrito, homemade huge tortilla stuffed with shredded pork. The beans are seasoned well and very tasty.
Overall a wonderful place for super fresh Mexican.
Salsa bar is also amazing, very fresh and great flavors."}
{"text":"So glad this place is nearby to fulfill the traditional Sonora barbacoa craving! 

Everything is outstanding, tastes just like I am eating them at their taquerias in Hermosillo, Sonora and those chino beans are the best! I love putting them inside my quesadilla!"}
{"text":"Carne Asad burrito was simply awesome.  Love being able to load the way I want from salsa bar."}
{"text":"Friendly customer service and great food! Clean and well kept environment with a view to the kitchen. Full condiment bar to add items like pickled onions, salsa, and other favorite taco toppings. Reasonable priced good food!!
Be sure to stop in and you will not be disappointed. (Unless you're looking for Chinese tacos as the name may imply for some)
Keep pushing out the good food El Chino Tacos!!"}
{"text":"The BEST!! All ala carte and delicioso!! Have a great salsa bar. Great place. Casual, warm, very nice people. Can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. I had the red chili burro but tried my crew's food too and everything I tried was really good!! Will be back to try more things on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Dude this place is awesome. Totally a hidden jewel. I was craving some barbacoa and this place nailed it spot on. The prices are great too. They have some tasty beans and rice as a side available that complement their tacos and burritos. I would def have to come back to this joint."}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast so when coming to the southwest, I want anything else besides pizza. So I took a 40 min walk from Downtown Phoenix to this place and holy crap, are these tacos super authentic and delicious!!! Got the ribeye, barbacoa and cachete (cheek) with the latter being my favorite. 

The flour tortillas had that awesome bite to them, the meat was super flavorful and juicy and they let you add your own toppings at their salsa bar. You have to add the red onions and their salsa roja which is spicy (and they warn you) but so so so good. 

The tacos run you like 2.50-3.00 so it's pretty affordable if you ask me. The owner mentioned them opening up a location near Central and Grant in March/April so I'm hoping its way closer to my hotel because I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"I first discovered Taqueria El Chino while at its original location in Hermosillo, Mexico and was ecstatic to see that they had expanded into the US.  Its the only place I have found to get famous \"head\" taco, tacos made from head meat and the prices can't be beat. The cachete (cheek) is my absolute favorite. A little off of the beaten path though, and not in the best neighborhood, but worth the drive."}
{"text":"The street tacos here cost a bit more than at other street taco places, but they make up for it by giving you more meat or other filling, and the tacos are definitely the most moist you'll find anywhere. Tastewise they're OK, although I find that adding a bit of salt wakes up the flavors significantly. And there's a good salsa bar offering lots of stuff to dress the taco with; definitely don't forget to add the pickled onions on your tacos or burrito. You may find a line leading to the counter if you come around lunch hour, but the line moves reasonably fast."}
{"text":"Fast and Friendly restaurant. Small location but packed with all the great flavors. They got all the Salsa variety you need. I was craving some good Barbacoa de res  just like I have ate in Mexico and I found it here!!! Definitely  will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great tacos.  Friendly service. The hot sauce has a nice kick to it. Small seating area, but I have never had an issue getting a seat.  Delicious."}
{"text":"We love going here, family run and very friendly. Our kids love the food too, carve asada blows your mind and the Barbacoa is on point, fresh salsa bar and perfect lemonade on fountain fresh."}
{"text":"I definitely feel the need to review this restaurant. I've been here three times and have been content each time. Yes, the place is small but clean. They have a salsa bar with all the fixings for your tacos. I got about 4 different tacos and all were very good as were the salsas. The owner greeted us and took our order. I liked that the owner was proactive and involved in checking that everything was running smooth with orders. I will definitely continue to dine here.Definitely authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"The best things in life aren't free; they are $2.25 + tax at Taquerias El Chino. I fancy myself a taco connoisseur. Not like that means anything because I fancy myself a connoisseur of anything delicious....pizza, hamburgers, sushi, breakfast burritos, BBQ, pasta, pho, ramen, etc.  That said, don't let that deter you from reading this review and going to TEC tonight. Actually, no, stop what you are doing right this instant and go IMMEDIATELY!! Listen, these tacos have made me want to be a better husband, father, and overall human being. It's for the greater good that you visit ASAP.

But, seriously, these tacos are some of the best in Phoenix - on par with La Santisima, Tacos Sahuaro, and Tacos Chiwas. I can't speak for every meat on the menu, but the adobada and carne asada are out of this world. I can only assume that the other protein options are just as good. If that wasn't enough, the salsa bar and service are top notch as well. The building and area are a bit suspect, but that's half the fun, right? I would never think of steering my fellow Yelpers wrong. Do yourself a f(l)avor and go stuff your taco hole with some deliciousness and thank me later."}
{"text":"While its no secret Downtown Phoenix has quickly emerged as a destination for great culinary fare, the same really can't be said for the area around the State Capitol.  At least not yet.  The neighborhood seems ripe for it with all the government employees in the area and it feels like all it would take is a few mom and pop shops to get the vibe going.  Well, now folks near the Capitol have their very own culinary destination.  It may not look like much, but Taqueria El Chino has all the makings of a neighborhood staple.

As I write this, Taqueria El Chino is currently rated as one of the top 40 restaurants in the city of Phoenix according to Yelp.  So investigate I must.  And hey, today was National Burrito Day so why not.  I arrived around 4pm just after work (before the dinner rush) and was looking to get some solid Mexican fare to go.  The building is on the southwest corner of 18th Ave & Van Buren in what (in all honesty) looks like a condemned building from the outside (parking is just around the corner).   The inside however is pretty relaxed.  The owner Rafael was manning the register for me, was super courteous and ready to guide me through the ordering process. 

Any of you who've read my reviews in the past know that I usually try to get a full experience whenever I go someplace new.  So while I was of course going to get a burrito today (a carne asada burrito in fact), I decided I'd go a few steps further.  In addition to my Carne Asada Burrito (a.k.a. a grilled ribeye burrito), I went with a Barbecoa de Pavo Torta (barbecued turkey sandwich), a Barbecoa de Res taco (barbecued beef taco), a Barbecoa de Puerco taco (barbecued pork taco), and a Pechuga de Pollo Quesadilla (chicken quesadilla).  Total cost for all the food and tax (no drink) came to about $24.  FYI, I used the Yelp check in to get one of the tacos free.  Also, as other Yelpers have noted, you can dress up your food anyway you like at the salsa bar at no extra cost.

Got my food to go in just under 10 minutes.  One thing I appreciated is they separated many of the ingredients in the to go boxes so that no items would get soggy and gross on the way home.  Once I got home and constructed my meal, it became clear to me that I went way too far with this order.  The portions were clearly bigger than I could handle in one sitting.  But I'll give you the rundown.

First, the quesadilla.  Awesome.  The herbs & spices they used on the chicken were fantastic and the chicken to cheese ratio was probably 80/20.  If you like the cheese to be the star, this quesadilla probably wouldn't be your thing, but I was a happy camper.  Next, the torta.  The turkey was pulled so it kind of had the consistency of pulled pork, but I wasn't complaining.  They stacked it high on the sandwich with toasted bread and I dressed it up from there.  Spot on.  Next the two tacos.  I would say the pork taco was my favorite of the two, but the beef was also excellent.  And both go great with Chino's green tomatillo sauce.  And of course, the burrito.  I didn't dress this one up to much (just some rice and beans), but that was on purpose.  The spices and herbs they use on the ribeye make this a tasty way to cap the meal (or at least what I could finish).

Taqueria el Chino is by no means the only Mexican food stop in the Phoenix area that will knock your socks off.  But its definitely the first I've found around the State Capitol.  I imagine many Capitol workers and staffers will be frequenting this place if they haven't been already.  The staff is friendly, the food is awesome, and the atmosphere is humble.  Next stop here for me will likely be for a horchata run.  I would say learn from my goof-up and exercise some portion control.  But when the food is this good, go nuts."}
{"text":"It's just plain good! The staff was ultra friendly, the restaurant was clean and the food was fresh. If the service was any faster, I swear someone read my mind when I walked through the door. I enjoyed my carne asada burrito so much, I went back and ordered two carne asada tacos. Everything was delicious. I'm not setting foot in Phoenix and missing an opportunity to grub here again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple years now since they opened. I'm not sure what the restaurant was before this taco shop but whatever it was the universe is better off without it because it brought us El Chino. The tacos are delish. The burritos are delish. I've tried almost everything by now (several items I had never heard of and a few I never thought I'd try) and everything is delicious. Juan, I believe in of the owners, is very friendly.. The cooks in the back pump out some amazing food like a well oiled machine. Even when it's busy I don't have to wait long for my order. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"What a wonderful delight. This is a one-of-a-kind Taqueria. The food is fresh grilled with an array of toppings, cilantro, hot sauce, salsa, and etc. well worth the visit."}
{"text":"The beans and tortillas were some of the most comforting and tasty I've had in my whole life. The carne asada is made with ribeye and is juicy and tender. All the meats were flavorful and prepared with lots of heart. Very kind and dedicated people! Definitely try an agua fresca-- they are totally legit and not overly sweet."}
{"text":"Very rude attitude. Corn or flower tortilla sir? You you know what corn and flower are sir? Was the attitude I got from this lady. Tacos are ok but not the best don't compete canelo"}
{"text":"Good, authentic cheap Mexican food.  You know when most of the customers are not speaking English, you're in the right place.  Most items can be ordered as torta, burrito or taco.  Combination plate of beef barbacoas with rice and beans was wonderful.  Corn tortillas are fresh and home made.  There is a great toppings station with cilantro, fresh jalapeno, an avocado cream sauce, pickled and fresh onion, lettuce, and three kinds of salsa.  Watch out, the red salsa is very, very hot, and is labeled accordingly.  Next time I'm trying the beef cheeks."}
{"text":"The chicken burritos or anything with the chicken is delicious. It takes a a little time but it's worth it.  They have a little bar to add things to your food and if you have the burrito they will roll it after you add your favorites."}
{"text":"The ribeye tacos are so go.  They are by far amazing.   The salsa bar is great the three salsas enhances  the food.  Simply the best carne taco around."}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time a couple weeks ago, and was extremely impressed with the place. The carne asada tacos were amazing - perfect flour tortillas, and a nice topping bar, including some delicious hot salsa which might catch you off guard if you're not used to \"hot\" actually being \"hot\".

The other meats are delicious - the pork, beef, turkey, cabeza, and cachete are all fantastic. This was the first place I've tried cabeza and cachete, and those are now my two favorites.

The people are friendly, service is fast, and prices are very reasonable. Definitely my new lunch spot."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. Great food great prices great tacos Mexican-style. Although the parking can be tricky, try to find a spot and make your way to this great Mexican restaurant. The quesadillas are bomb, the tacos are freaking awesome. And you can't beat 1 liter cokes sprite."}
{"text":"Arrived to Phoenix, AZ and my first stop... Taqueria el Chino!! I had one of the most amazing burritos de carne azada and tacos the barbacoa de puerco. The  owner señor Rafael and his entire team super friendly and the service exceptional. I was curious why he called his place El Chino. He said his great grandpa is from China and family comes from Sonora, Mexico. A great way to start my vacation."}
{"text":"After traveling for 4 hours, we searched for somewhere to eat some good tacos. These were better than good! Juicy chicken, el carne asada so tender."}
{"text":"Jackie was pretty cool, and the dude in the back making the tacos was way chill and knows how to cook. They had golf playing on a projector which was great. The prices are a little higher than most places around the area but definitely worth it. I had the adobada and carne asada mixed burrito. It was fire! I also tried the free check in barbacoa taco, it was very flavorful. Definitely will be going there every weekend. Want to try the cabeza ones next time I hear everyone likes those..."}
{"text":"Tacos were ok. I think they are a little pricey. After reading the other reviews, I thought I would find the best tacos ever......but no. I will still keep searching for the best tacos in PHX.  I still prefer these tacos over most taco places in this city. The owners and service was awesome."}
{"text":"I love love Chino! Best damn tacos and burritos in town. My favorite is a turkey quesadilla. They know they're meats! Let's them roll your burrito for you!"}
{"text":"Tacos are to die for My friend recommended this place I went in they are very friendly.  Answer all your questions.  I got 4 tacos pastor and asada and birria, really good flavor and not greasy at all. They have a salsa and all you need for the tacos.  The res sauce us really good has a spicy kick to it. Really love this place"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place on our way back to Cali. We ordered two carne asada burritos and they were delicious. The ingredients were super fresh. If you are ever in the Phoenix area...."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great friendly people. Try there Carne Asada  and the Chino Quesadilla."}
{"text":"This is my kind of Taco joint.  The Lengua and Cachete Tacos are excellent and the Carne Asada is the most tender.  The Shrimp & Fish taco was great too.  If you like corn tortillas, like me, you'll love the corn tortillas here."}
{"text":"Delicious little dive, way cuter inside than expected!  Everyone in my group loved their food and a few were very excited that Adobada was on the menu.  I had a carne asada burrito with beans and it was amazing.  I appreciate that they let you stock up your toppings and then roll your burrito for you so everything is just the way you want it."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my girlfriend and couldn't have been happier! The service and food was great, if we hadn't just been in Phoenix for the weekend we would definitely go here all the time!"}
{"text":"Been on the hunt for bomb legit tacos & they definitely hit the spot!! Had the beef barbacoa tacos so good and the beans are not traditional but so good!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a work excursion and there were several scared and skeptical folks in the group when surveying the surroundings. Short end of the story is everyone LOVED every dish! I ordered the lengue taco and barabacoa taco. The lengue was savory, tender, and perfectly cooked. The barabacoa was worth killing a diet for seconds and thirds. I ordered a side of the beans and couldn't stop talking about how happy my taste buds were, and then their sadness upon being done. Service was very friendly and efficient, and our party of 11 was able to get in and out in under the hour we needed to meet our appointments. Best street tacos I've had in such a long time! How I didn't discover this place sooner is a regret and loss for me. Yum!"}
{"text":"Not so authentic over priced kitchen and staff not so clean, and homeless people surround the restaurant. Not recommended and won't be going back at all. Meat was not cooked, they were also salty and cold. Really bad customer service. Rude and inattentive staff."}
{"text":"Very unassuming little place. Along with the name, you wouldn't think much. The place is great. Straightforward menu with plenty of meat options, including carne con verde o roja. One of if not the best salsa bars I've seen. 

Fill up your burrito and they roll it back up for you.

The place is always clean and the staff hospitable.

Not cheap, but inexpensive delicious Mexican fare."}
{"text":"Everything we ate was delicious! We will definitely be back! Favorites were the carne asada, beef barbacoa and lengua(tongue). Be sure to wash them down with horchata!"}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior scare you away. This interior is completely different than the exterior. There is an awesome Mexican restaurant inside. Upon our first visit the owner welcomed us and asked if we had been there before. We hadn't. He explained everything to us, how they make it, what it is, how to order, how to build on your order with the items on the salsa bar (a lot more than salsa on it). We splurged and tried the most popular meats as tacos and WOW! Great flavors! Some familiar, some unique. Super fresh everything. Some heat to a couple of those salsas too. We not only swooned over our meals but loved the entire experience. Highly recommended. This place should be in your regular rotation."}
{"text":"As soon as I arrived the staff welcomed me and I felt as if I just walked into my Nana's house. There is literally a traditional residential front door that when closes makes you feel like you are in someone's awesome smelling home. Granted the area is right in the middle of Phoenix and there are people around that someone might consider this restaurant \"dirty\" or \"unsafe\" but that is not the case. This place not only raises the value of the community it is in, I believe they are making a difference by providing an excellence service. This is coming from a guy that is born and raised in East Mesa that hates the Phoenix and downtown area. This place is great! 

Now with the food. 
10 stars. 
Get everything on the menu because it's so dang cheap! A taco for 2 bucks?! What?! The meat is something of a miracle, it is so tender and tasteful. My wife and I got the beef Barbacoa, and carne Asada tacos. They are BOMB. All you business professionals need to come to this place for lunch and make it your place for lunch."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Carne asada and beans are great. And the salsa is definitely spicy.  Also the chicken is pretty good."}
{"text":"They say they put ribeye steak on their burritos it's more like fat never been so disappointed. Worst burrito and overpriced do not get any carne asada from this place. Never going to go here again they are not the best downtown Taco spot"}
{"text":"I work at the Arizona State Capitol and we are wanting for good non-cafeteria food. El Chino fits the bill and then some. The people and the food are fantastic. 

El Chino has become a mainstay as it's modestly priced and consistently good Mexican food. 

This is the perfect Capitol lunch spot."}
{"text":"Hands down best burrito I've had in phoenix mostly because you put what you want in it! The beans here are so good and the ingredients are always fresh and the salsa bar is super good too. I also love the family vibe in there. Every time you go in you're greeted warmly! I don't ever see myself getting tired of this place."}
{"text":"Well as i search for great tasting tacos, I found a great place in downtown Phoenix that is Awesome!!! El Chino makes excelent tacos n not to mention burritos, quesadillas and tortas....tasty meat especially the asada!! Great service, great people.....will be going back to taste everything in there menu lol when I get a chance......by the way the Refrito beans are the BOMB!!! GREAT JOB N FOOD CHINO!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Without a doubt the best tacos I have had outside of my grandma's kitchen. Service was awesome, restaurant was super clean. I highly recommend this place, I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Quick, affordable, and quality delicious Sonoran food. Definitely a must-do when hungry in the area!"}
{"text":"Yummy another great find... tacos on point and the salsa bar was amazing  a little pricey...busy during lunch -"}
{"text":"Food is very good, might be confusing for first timers. If you get a burrito it will be served open so you can add toppings from the topping-bar and give it back to the kitchen so they can wrap it for you. Salsas can be very hot so go light on them if you put it any inside the burrito. Like I said, food is good, but cost is surprisingly high considering the location."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend had come to AZ for a week and we're staying on downtown phoenix.  We were hungry and love good food so we found el chino on yelp with rave reviews. 
Hopped in the challenger and headed down. At first we each ordered a taco. We didn't think it was a big deal. But wow! That flavor! It was so fresh and so delicious! We moved onto burritos and then more stuff on the menu. The owner, El Chino was an awesome guy. So laid back and helped us venture through the menu. He was a great host. We promised to come back with friends and in that 6 day period of staying in Phoenix we visited el chino 3 times with different groups of friends.  No other place stands the competition. Trust a foodie!"}
{"text":"There are many reasons to be upset about my first experience here. The MAIN reason is that I ordered a side of rice and beans for my to go order and I never received them.  

The second reason will be the service. My coworker and I decided to call in before arriving since we were going to be late for our meeting, we were also ordering for others as well. My friend put the call on speaker and I could tell the order taker was getting very annoyed, which I understand because my friend was being quite complicated. Yet, when we arrived the order taker turned the annoyance into rudeness and that was not okay for me. I should be giving two stars but the manager definitely made up for that, because he was making sure we were okay and being very friendly and welcoming which I totally appreciate! 

HOWEVER I still paid a little over $13 for what ended up being only two tacos & a drink since my rice and beans were missing. As for the taste of the tacos they were pretty good I just wish they would automatically come with all the toppings. I find that when they come with everything it accentuates the taste. Plus there was a lot of fat spots in the meat that made the texture quite chewy. 

Conclusively, I would totally give this place another shot! I just wouldn't never order to go."}
{"text":"Very hard to support small business if they are not consistent with hours. Several times now I have tried to go and they are closed. Yelp hours are clearly stated yet they don't abide by them. I just called at 6 and they answered and said they were closing for the night. If you want to close early, change your posted hours!"}
{"text":"Great authentic local Mexican restaurant. Wonderful food and service. Many different non-standard, or non-chain selections for taco or burro. Hot or very hot if you like it hot, but not if you do not."}
{"text":"Well,  I was excited to try a new place while I was downtown for some work business. Unfortunately for me, I fell victim to food poisoning.  I had a carne asada burrito and chips with salsa, nothing crazy.  It tasted fine, but a few hours later, my body said otherwise.  I'm so disappointed! We'll have to see how the next health inspection goes."}
{"text":"Food is tasty. Heaven to the taste buds! They also have friendly and customer driven service!!!"}
{"text":"Killer Carne asada taco! Made with ribeye. Salsa bar was great! Had chopped Serrano and a fantastic red sauce! Very hot. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Great spot for authentic and flavorful dishes. The green chili is amazing! I'm picky with my rice and beans, and these two traditional staples were spot on. Even a simple cheese quesadilla was delicious. My family and I will be returning! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food is spectacular. The Adobado isn't in the news articles but should be. The lack of stars is for the service. Now I know lil places like this service expectation SHOULD be low. 
First time in this place and when I ordered my food I was given containers for salsas and condiments. I wondered around looking and the girl that didn't give them to me jus watched. When my order was called I asked where my beans were. \"She's getting them , give her a minute\" rude. I ordered beans and looked for a spoon when asked the same girl and was told that they \"didn't have anymore, we ran out\" NOT TEN DA$& mins later she is stocking all the plastic cutlery and guess what. I even heard people behind me complaining the she over charged them. 
Too many other good spots to put up with this crap. 

Sad sad sad"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The quesadillas are AMAZING!!  From the outside it doesn't look like much but the inside is pretty nice and clean. A ratings from food dept. highly recommend for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've had better! Not the best in Phoenix! Del taco has better tacos! Service sux too!"}
{"text":"Way down southwest Phoenix, a hidden restaurant my friend has found, once every two weeks he walks from work for some Mexican food. He suggested I go try it and I did, and not it was a great joint for some Mexican food. You put your order in and they give you an open borrito  to go add the extras form a salad bar kind of station. 

The lady at the cash register was very friendly and the gentleman behind the food bar made sure food was prepared to order and asked how it was after we finished. 

I ordered a carne a sada borrito with red sauce and it was filling, delicious and full of flavors. I got a cup of soda with it which was probably the only disappointing thing that they charge a dollar for refills, in advance. 

Any way, this was an amazing place with majorly great flavored food and ok definitely be back."}
{"text":"El Chino is my favorite burrito joint in Phoenix. Also a plus that it is close to my house. The meat is grilled and you can easily taste the difference. You also can fill the burrito with whatever you want from the bar before they roll it for you! So good!"}
{"text":"I love this place because the flavors take me back to Hermosillo and real tacos de cabeza. Without a doubt the best tacos de cabeza in Phoenix!! My kids love this place as much as I do and ask to come here for breakfast on Saturdays. The salsas are always fresh and the staff always friendly.  Sorry I didn't take pics this time. Next time for sure!!"}
{"text":"Authentic, tasty and wonderful!! Fresh ingredients, simplicity in the decor. The proprietors were so gracious and kind. I would eat here often if I were a local."}
{"text":"I have it 4 out 5 stars because I only like the shredded beef tacos. The steak seemed to be old and taste less."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Tried three different tacos: barbacoa, cabeza, and carne azada. Not the best I've had but pretty good. Would have liked double corn tortillas and a little more meat. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"AMAZING AUTHENTIC FLAVOR!! 
We pretty much had a taco of each and on some we had double.... The head and tongue have outstanding flavor and there barbacoas are the bomb!! Carne asada is very delicious and kept me wanting more.... The owner \"el chino\" is very welcoming and more then great customer service skills! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They put the meat in the tortilla, let you put whatever you want in it, and then wrap it up for you! What more can you ask for? Ten out of ten, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great tip on the horchata, very good, a bit of coconut as well
Fab street tacos - head cheek tongue if you're not picky are great!
A new spot to go to every time I'm in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Taqueria el chino had the best carne asada burrito i have ever had. Great service and atmosphere. Quick service and great salsa bar."}
{"text":"food is AMAZING and so affordable.  i will never buy another taco anywhere else.  super fresh and mr. chino is super friendly!  drive past the crazy parking nightmare of downtown phoenix and stop here!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and the barbacoa de res combo plate was great!! Will definitely be coming back!! Highly recommended! Tastes just like traditional home cooking!"}
{"text":"Amazing Food, Great People. You will definitely enjoy your meal & your time here. You must try the carne asada, you'll enjoy every bite except the last (because that means it's all gone)."}
{"text":"Always so friendly and the food is fantastic!  Love love live this place . this place is. Little hudden jewel in the heart of Phoenix, and super clean!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Tried both the tacos and the burrito. Both were great but the barbacoa de Res burrito was amazing. Nice, clean, and friendly. So glad we stopped!"}
{"text":"I had the fish stew and green chili burrito, two Pastor tacos and  there Bean's. oh my god ! (awesome) . it a small place but worth the trip"}
{"text":"I loved the food here. Absolutely the best Mexican food I had ever. The employees are nice and have pride in there product."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Easily the best taco place in town. The prices are cheap, the meat is fresh, mesquite grilled. A taco will run you 2.50-2.95 but they also have burritos, quesadillas and delicious beans. Eat local and eat well!"}
{"text":"First time ever going here. I came because of the reviews on Yelp. The customer service is great. It is a small restaurant on the corner and it's a little warm if you stay indoors to eat but overall I had a good experience. Since it was my first time, I didn't know that you had to pay for the rice & beans separately. It can get a bit costly. However, the lady at the registered didn't charge me for that and just charged me for the street tacos I ordered. I could have passed on the rice & beans as they were just ok, but the TACOS WERE AMAZING! Carne asada street tacos. I would come back for the tacos for sure and friend service."}
{"text":"Different type of set in regards to building a burrito and taco.  Not what I'm use to doing.  But the burritos are a big and the meat is good.  After eating it was happy.  Fairly priced and original.  Lastly the owner/guy running the drawer did an act of kindness that you don't see often to a patron.  Because of that I like this place even more now.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food! Everything is made to order, I would recommend the carne asada tacos, medium. Prices are reasonable. They have a good spread on salsa and taco garnishments. The agua frescas were ok."}
{"text":"Good in an unlikely location. Thick and delicious corn tortillas... The Carne en salsa Roja is great and so is the beef barbacoa. Awesome salsa bar and flavorful beans. Friendly staff too. The red spicy salsa will make your mouth burn in a good way... But beware... They ain't lying on the spicy level. Decent prices and a wide selection of fresh foods. Good spot for anytime you're at the AZ state fairgrounds."}
{"text":"This is a great hidden gem in the State Capitol area and worthy recipient of the Phoenix New Times' best burrito in the valley award. The ratio of meat/cheese/rice/beans is impeccable, and you get to decide how much sauce or lettuce to put on. Just use caution with the very hot sauce that is marked. It is acidic to the point where it will burn your tongue and lips on contact. All of the employees are very friendly and clearly take pride in providing a good dining experience."}
{"text":"This was the best burrito I have ever eaten! They use rib eye for the carne asada. The meat was very tender and very flavorful. The red chili beef burrito was also very good. The best thing is that they give you the burrito opened on a plate with the meat on it. You get to put in what you want from the salsa and vegetable bar. When I eat a burrito I don't normally eat the tortilla but I ate the whole tortilla. They bring the tortillas in from Mexico . Yum!! And the homemade salsa was awesome.  I will try to get back there the next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Fantastic taco spot! Food is delicious, place is very clean and well kept! Will definitely return! Cheap too."}
{"text":"TOP TIER BURRITO! I loved the fact that they let you put toppings on it and then they will roll it up for you, it adds a nice touch to it."}
{"text":"Not good and not sure how they got a strong 5 star rating.. Not sure how 40 ppl so far that have taken the time to write a review have loved this place.. Did not taste good. Not impressed with their \"fresh salsa bar\" either... I waited to write this review just incase I was just feeling grumpy last night ... Woke up this morning ... Nope still disappointed.... Maybe my review will help someone like me using yelp as a guide to help find yummy places to eat when you don't know where to go and are not from the area.... Which is why I chose this place. Can't win them all lol !"}
{"text":"Amazing food and customer service!!! I ate hear with a few of my shipmates and they really showed us great hospitality so I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Cheap
 Delicious
 Excellent Customer Service
 Fresh
 Did I mention Delicious?

I go to el Chino about twice a week. I acknowledge this with no shame. Since they have opened the service is much more streamlined and fast. The ingredients are fresh and with variety for those that really like to pile their tacos with a multitude of toppings.

Tacos are street-style size. Burritos are large in size. You will leave satisfied without feeling miserable. 

Suggestion: Get the Turkey taco. . . it will not disappoint. Make sure to put cheese on it."}
{"text":"Their tacos are bomb! The staff is so friendly and never disappoint with their exceptional service."}
{"text":"I'm from Mexicali, where the street tacos are AMAZING. I've been in Phoenix for over 2 years and I can genuinely say that I FOUND A LEGIT TACO STAND

The salsa bar is cool: BEWARE of the salsa roja because it's spicy

Customer service is great! The cashier is the owner's son. 

If you're from Mexico or SoCal, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The Carme Asada burrito is amazing! About twice the price of everything else on the menu, but definitely worth it. High quality meat, and great toppings. You order from the burrito bar where they cook the meat to order and They add beans rice and/or cheese if you want. You then take it to the salsa bar to add your salsa and a few other things, and they wrap it for you.

Food was excellent. Service was great. People were extremely friendly. Great menu (see attached photo of menu).

Downsides: neighborhood is a bit sketchy. Only beans they have are refried."}
{"text":"These tacos are delicious...best tacos I have had in Phoenix..I will keep coming. Customer Service is Excellent. Salsa bar is súper. Loved the lengua And cabeza tacos. Carne asada burrito is delicious. If you come You wont be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh and delicious food at great prices with fantastic service.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"Small, great service and great food.  Being from the south, this was unlike anything we have had before.  Very simple menu, inexpensive, you can add toppings at the salsa bar.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Fresh, welcoming and authentic.  My new favorite!  I appreciate a salsa bar and theirs is complete with fresh veggies- tomatoes, cucumbers, cilantro and pico de gallo.  The owner is really nice and I will definitely be back to support this small business!  You are in for a treat."}
{"text":"Oh.my.yum. Went to El Chino over the weekend during my visit to Phoenix-- and I can't get these tacos off my mind! My fiancé and I visited from Portland and this was pretty much the best part of our trip. He's from Cali and I'm originally from Phoenix, let's just say we crave good Mexican food when we come to town and El Chino nailed it. I think together with my parents, we ordered five different tacos and they were all amazing. The consensus was that the carne asada was the favorite. The tacos were a lot bigger than we expected, but that was the best part about them. They aren't anywhere near those dinky street tacos-- so come hungry and ready to eat!

If we could pack up the restaurant and take it with us, we totally would. Open a location in Portland, please!"}
{"text":"Stopped here to eat on a business trip prior to a meeting. Fantastic food, great selection of meats and the best \"burn\" I've had from a salsa in a long time. I will definitely come back!

Had a carne en salsa verde burrito and a lengua taco. Definitely filled me up and tasted great!"}
{"text":"If you're in Phoenix, this is THE taco place to try. They serve a variety of style as well as larger meals including burritos and combo plates. Can't go wrong with any of the Barbacoa, Pollo, or Carne choices. The Adobada is excellent too. They do great work here!"}
{"text":"From the friendly service and comforting and playful family vibe to the fresh salsa bar and the overly generous amount of meat in the tacos, it's places like this gem that keep my expectations excessively high when I am in the mood for authentic Mexican food. Which is always. And the horchata...their horchata is the first I've had in years that didn't make me wish I could add my own touch to it. Perfection."}
{"text":"The proverbial hole-in-the-wall:

My co-worker and I was originally there to provide support. When we got here, there was ample free parking adjacent to the building. At first, we weren't sure we were at the right building because the exterior looked like a bar that was in need of a facelift. Nevertheless, we walked towards the entrance facing the main road, and went inside.

I had brought a lunch that day, but I came away with a taco. Because I HAD to. 

How it works: 
This place offers a number of different meats: carne asada, barbacoa, pechuga de pollo (chicken breast). You then choose what type of dish you want: tacos, burritos, quesadillas, or tortas. I chose a single carne asada taco and my friend ordered a carne en salsa verde burrito. You can choose to add beans, rice, and/or cheese for an additional charge.  

From there, you get your dish without any toppings and head over to the salsa/salad bar to choose whatever you'd like. You then bring it back to the counter and they wrap it for you. We were getting it to go, so they wrapped by taco in some plastic. My friend brought his unwrapped burrito back to the counter so that they could finish putting it together. 

Service: everybody we interacted with were super friendly. I think the owner was the person who greeted us. They were excellent burrito wrappers too. 

Food: Everything tasted very fresh. The salsa/salad bar was clean and nothing looked like it had been sitting for more than a couple hours in the chilled compartments. The meats were really tasty too! 

Price: It's not the cheapest Mexican place, but you get what you pay for in terms of the quality of food.

I'll be back for lunch."}
{"text":"Riquísimos los tacos, un pedacito de Hermosillo aquí, muy buenos como siempre la cajera y el que sirve los tacos les falta customer service, muy pedantes al hacer la orden, no parece una taqueria de sonora."}
{"text":"This place is good. Don't be scared to come to this part of town. People live here too. There's a great boxing gym next door so you should be safe.  I liked the lengua and Carne en Salsa Roja tacos. The refried beans are very flavorful too. So next time you make a wrong turn & need a good meal, stop on in."}
{"text":"Signed up for Yelp just to give this place a 5 star rating. Their barbacoa was amazing and the service was super friendly. Really good price for the amount of food you get too. Will definitely come here again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????10???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????carne asada burritos+???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????elchino??????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Great food big portions.  Owner came out and ate with us and chatted.  Super friendly staff.  This taqueria is as good as many I've been to in old Mexico."}
{"text":"Some of the best barbacoa \"de cabeza\" I have ever had.  Since moving in to Phoenix, coming from a city that is close to the border, I have always been searching for this kind of meat.  I was able to find some Mexican places here and there but their meat was always dry and nowhere near as flavorful as this place. 

I even told the owner \"there are some places but\" and the owner finished with \"but no one does it good.\" We both laughed.  I ordered 3 tacos and a torta totally underestimating the amount of meat that I was getting and took it home.  The amount of meat which I stuffed into the bread, to make the torta, was a ton and I still had enough to make another 6-7 tacos!  Satisfaction guaranteed.  No wonder this place has a solid rating."}
{"text":"There are few places that miss you when you are gone, and this place did. I came in after a long hiatus from tortillas as I was dieting and when the lady at the counter took my credit card, she realized it was me.  She called to the back and couldn't believe I was there.  The kitchen staff said that we missed having you here during lunch and wanted to make sure I was satisfied with everything. Well I am.  Its just food this good needs to be taken in moderation, because it is easy to get carried away here.  Everything is good. I have crossed up and down the menu several times and when it come to cabeza and cachete(cheek) tacos and burritos, this is the PHX spot hands down.  Plus they let you load up your burritos with plenty of fixings before they fold it up perfectly for you. 

Its proximity to the State Capitol makes it my favorite quick taco between committee meetings or a great place to sit and debate policy over some tacos and horchata. 

So thank you to a place that makes you feel like you been away from home too long."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and enjoyed some of the best tacos we've ever had.  Super friendly couple, Barbacoa Res tacos our favorite."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican not the commercial chain food. Fresh & made to order. The service is wonderful ."}
{"text":"I have come here a couple times for lunch, and the food and customer service is great! The salsa bar is fresh and delicious. The staff is super friendly and helpful. If you're sick of capital cafeteria food you should stop by."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in PHX!!!!  Very clean and friendly. Must stop by, and check this place out. I'll be driving from Mesa again this week!  Carne Assad is Ribeye steak!!!"}
{"text":"Carne  asada is good, but way too expensive. I must say it was very fresh. The chino beans are to die for. I will keep coming back for these beans. They are the best version of frijoles puercos or charos I have ever ate. Please give them a try."}
{"text":"Just in town for the weekend and my boyfriend was craving a good taco shop - WE FOUND IT! the simplicity of the restaurant and ingredients used - proves it truly does not take much to please customers. The gentleman who took our order (possibly the owner?) was very friendly and personable to every one who came in the door. 

If I lived in Phoenix this would be a go-to spot - can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Oh My The tacos are in deed some of the best ones I've had, their salsa bar is delicious. Plenty to choose from! The ambience is not the great the workers talk loud and talk about their personal life, not cool. The waiters are some what friendly when you do get their attention. You don't get free refills. So if you want good food and don't care for great customer service than come on you'll sure are to love the tacos."}
{"text":"Great little spot in downtown Phoenix for classic Sonoran tacos burritos quesadillas and tortas. Inexpensive good quality food with a great fresh salsa bar. If you're around one of the better ones in town."}
{"text":"Riquisimos tacos estilo Sonora. Me quede con ganas de comer mas. El señor Rafael buenisima onda muy atento con todos sus clientes. Definitivamente vuelvo"}
{"text":"Hey Yelpers... Im a die hard Mexican Food critic and mainly pesimistic on new spots. Many times, even before our almighty Yelp, i have been victim to restaurants that claim grandeour when there is none. So I seek out The authentic... The revolutionary, the spot that sets the bar. So... I have to admit before my affinity was shattered... El chino had me sold. I raved to my masses of there quality and taste. I was of the first to walk in to this hole in the wall. Then, was El Chino, in the back killing it... Like magic churning out delight, savory stews, grilled heavenly morsels... And I its cheerleader as I licked my fingers clean. But loyalty draws me to my fan fare regularly... And on this dismal day my accolades shattered and I witnessed as others a very different El Chino. The fault, I believe was the absence of their namesake. El chino was nolonger there. And I in horror saw Microwaved left overs from fridge to nuke... coagulated disgust shoveled to my wifes tortilla... How as her man, allow it to transpire... No not me so i called them out... And struck them down. Read my others and 1 is a  response to a message sent denying what we witnessed."}
{"text":"Very tasty, lots of variety. Many of the safe/traditional (carne asada, pork, chicken) options with plenty of choices for the more adventurous eaters (lengua, cabeza, cachete). The build method is great: choose your base (torta, corn/flour tortilla, burrito) and meat, then grab some veggies and bring them back to the counter and they whip it up for you perfectly. Speaking of grabbing the veggies...the topping bar is very ingenious. It has a great variety of salsas and much more. You add exactly what you want. The only reason you'd not like something you get here would be because of something you added that you didn't like. Oh, and horchata. What is there not to like?

Another thing for the grab and go crowd: the ingredients are handed to you separate. No soggy tortas or tortillas falling apart at your table."}
{"text":"There isn't many things In my life that will bring tears to my eyes... The one ill admit too is a bomb taco! Its hard to find good tacos out here in phoenix because many places think they have to put a million toppings on it and fancy it up. Im old school, give me a tortilla, fill it with deliciously seasoned meat cilantro, onion and some good flavored hot salsa.... That's what El Chino gives you. I ordered 2 tacos one barbacoa (flour tortilla) and one carne asada (corn tortilla) and my buddy and I split a barbacoa burrito. 

The salsa bar is freaking amazing! It literally has everything you can possibly want, even a few more items that I personally think dont belong on a taco or burrito.It was nice though, I got my tacos with tortilla and meat and it was my decision what went on it. The burrito was left open, they let me put any items I wanted on it then they took it back wrapped it, and cut it in half for me. 

The Carne asada taco fell short of really rocking my taste buds.. The corn tortilla was very dry the \"carne asada\" was apparently ribeye. It was descent meat but there was sooo much fat mixed in. Now moving on to the barbacoa taco!!! Holy crap it was bomb!!! the salsa mixed into the seasonings they put into it made it so much better! I devoured that bad boy!!!! The burrito was above average, only problem I had is that they charge extra for rice and beans.. Seriously bro, that is just filler. 

Overall id go back for barbacoa tacos on flour tortillas. This place isn't cheap either, they charge extra for everything. Worth a shot if your in the area and like tacos."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the better taco hubs in Phoenix. Just a short walk from the Capitol building and Wesley Bolin Plaza. Friendly, affordable, cooked to order deliciousness. I will hit you up again and again!!"}

{"text":"Let me start off by saying... I don't give five star reviews often, but when I do, it's with a purpose! 

When you come to El Chino's, it's not in the vest of neighborhoods or a mega shopping center, who cares about that??!! When I am hungry,  the only thing that I care about is GOOD food and a clean restaurant, and quality service is always a plus. I will tell you this place has ALL THREE! The owner was super appreciative that we went off the beaten path to come to his restaurant. I would tell you to close your eyes and read this review as if you were me, but that would make much sense! 
I had the carne asada burrito and I have to say... hands down, second to none, and without a doubt, this is THE BEST carne asada burrito I have ever had in my life! They make the steak for you and put the rice and beans on your burrito and then you add all your toppings (kinda like a self-serve Chipotle) then you give it back to them and they wrap it for you. My burrito ended up being about the size of my forearm! 
I literally thought about this place all day... the best meal that I have had in a long time, and if I was anywhere close to this place when I return to AZ I will go out of my way to come back here. Without question. Without hesitation. 
Awesome job El Chino's... you gave me a complete different appreciation for authentic mexican food. 
I. Cant. Wait. To. Go. Back. 

Now....... I am drooling"}
