{"text":"Chanced on this place after striking out at every other breakfast place in town, and was pleasantly surprised. It's certainly not a classy joint, but has that \"off the beaten path/hole in the wall\" appeal to it. Staff was amazingly friendly, super fast service, and good food. 4 stars because I wouldn't say it was amazing -- just your run of the mill, cooked on a grill, a little too greasy and then thrown together in a heap kind of food, but it totally hit the spot. Also super reasonable prices ($5-$9 per plate) with huge portions. Will ABSOLUTELY be back - worth it just for the atmosphere, price, and serving staff."}
{"text":"Been here many times.  In my opinion, it is off of the beaten path, but locals know all about it.  WIth the help of Yelpers, others will, too.

This place is great for breakfast.  I haven't eaten here aside from breakfast, so my review is based soley on breakfast.  

Upon entering, please notice that you need to wait to be seated.  Weekends can get very busy- so go on a week day to get great specials!

I think we have only ordered the Early Riser, which is always too much food for me!  I end up bringing half home.  I always think, \"I am so hungry this time, that I am sure I can scrarf it down!\"

I will go here for their burgers one afternoon & update my review.  In the meantime, go!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by this place. I really wanted it to be good. It's very small and looks like a local joint. Our service was good but that's about where it ends. 

I got the corned beef hash and to my surprise it was not out of a can. There wasn't a ton of it but the flavor of the corned beef alone wasn't terrible. Other than that, the potatoes were wayyy under seasoned and some weren't even done all the way. My husband got the barn buster and that was just awful. No seasoning and it was a big plate of mush. I can make better biscuits and sausage gravy better than that. Also, the coffee was pretty burnt and just not good. It's also Hamburger Station, which is weird but interesting, and I would come back to try that bc it looked cheap and good. I will never be back for breakfast though."}
{"text":"Sometimes breakfast here is really good.  The cooks change constantly, so its inconsistent.  It's a dinner breakfast...cheap and greasy.  The really nice thing is that this is combined with a Hamburger Station, so people at your table can pick between breakfast or burgers or both.  Service has always been good.  Seems like all the other breakfast places in Cuyahoga Falls have gotten too pretentious, so this is a nice alternative."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. We chose this place based on the Yelp reviews and weren't disappointed. Good food at very reasonable prices. Decor is quaint, not fancy, but clean and welcoming. Never had Saganaki before but I highly recommend it."}
