{"text":"The tamales and plantains were good but chicken was dry.  Not sure about other dishes.  Wife who has lived in South & Central America was not impressed.  Viva Chicken, although on the expensive side, is the best for rotisserie."}
{"text":"After driving by this place for weeks we finally decided to give it a try. I'll be honest and say that the exterior of the restaurant could use some improvements. It currently has a very non-welcoming vibe to it. I think partially it's due to the fact that you can't see through the windows and there are weeds growing all around it. But, the food is delicious. Far better than the vast majority of the restaurants in the area. I highly recommend this place and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch had a great experience will be back very soon. Inside it was clean and fresh. The chicken, salad dressing, salsa, grilled veggies were all seasoned well and new exciting flavors. Don't miss the chance for a great meal."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The dinner for two serves more than two people. The cilantro rice and grilled vegetables were seasoned perfectly. The grilled meats (sausage, steak, pork, rotisserie chicken and blood sausage) were perfectly cooked/seasoned. Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"It maybe a bit inconvenient to get there, but the food is well worth it. Good portions, two meals and a appetizer for just under 25.00. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Really good food.  Well worth the price. Three of us split a dinner for two, and there was more than enough for us.  The service was okay.  Definitely will be making a return trip.

Update:  The return trip was the very next night.  Just as awesome.  Boosting rating to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I think this place might be out of business. Noticed they've been closed anytime ive stopped by"}
{"text":"Very tasty, we tried the grilled meat sampler big enough for 3 people. Loved it. This place is on our this."}
{"text":"Stopped by this spot yesterday as I wanted to support a business close to home. I normally go to Pio Pio on East Blvd for Peruvian food from Indian Trail. 

I ordered the whole chicken with a side of plantains and made a stop at another business. As I was driving I could not wait to get home as the food smelled so good. 

Ok ok got home and proceed to eat and OMG the chicken was so flavorful, tender and seasoned just right.  My son 6yrs old tore up that chicken and asked for more (he's a foodie) lol. 

I will be back to try other items and must say this chicken gives Pio Pio a run for their money."}
{"text":"Went for Mothers Day with my two kids and hubby. The server was super slow and it was not busy at all. Serving tables for many years it was not good service. Having gone to Generos for couple years then trying La Cancha it was a definitely a drop in taste. It is the same owner from Generos but the food was not the same. The prices compared to the amount of food you got was disappointing. My husband assumed his plate was mine when the server brought the food lmao. The food was okay but honestly I most likely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very good, hope they get their liquor license, but the food is on par with the old and previous Gennaro back by Walmart in Indian Trail!!!"}
{"text":"Preface: It's not easy to give a bad rating for me. Trust me, in over 400 reviews I've given a 1 star only 13 times. Ok, enough about why this pains me, because it does, let me explain MY experience, I'd prefer you not judge them solely on my experience, just learn from it:

I saw a local restaurant at lunchtime with few reviews but a great rating, and add that it is Peruvian food, which I love, I couldn't wait to satisfy my craving for what I believe is one of the best cuisines in the world. Let's rock and roll.

The d√©cor was a bit bare, there was children's shows on the TV at the bar while I sat at a booth. Ok, I true family restaurant! Great! I won't mind the atmosphere is not catering to customers at all, as long as the food is good.

I ordered the ceviche appetizer and the Peruvian style quarter chicken with rice and beans. the chicken had that smoky flavor you would look for, but it wasn't exactly a fall off the bone tender meat OR that nice crispy skin. Bummer.....at least the ceviche should be good. It is a staple of Peruvian meals.....and this is where it all goes to down, down, down.

The ceviche was served RAW. Now mind you, I KNOW that ceviche is raw fish cooked by the acidity of the lime juice that the fish is soaked in. Imagine this massive plate of fresh cut tilapia and red onions, then pouring lime juice all over the fish...and serving it RIGHT AWAY. I make this at home ALL THE TIME, and it has to \"cook\" in the juice for about 45min-1hr, depending on the size of the fish pieces. It was completely inedible. Trust me, I tried so hard to find a piece that might have been already marinated. Nope. So, I told the server, she said that's how it is supposed to be. I did not date a crazy Peruvian for 2 years to not know what proper ceviche tastes like, because her mom was awesome at making ceviche, and it sounds really lame that I'm saying this but it baffles me I know this about ceviche and they don't. She asks if I still want it, I said no thank you, apologizing about 5 times that I'm sorry I can't eat it. I think this might be the first meal of my life I actually sent back. She walked off quite annoyed. Don't worry ma'am, we are BOTH annoyed at this point. 

And then what happens next is beyond me.....

It is kind of ok to have a dish not work for a customer, just take it away and apologize. But her way of getting back is to vanish.....like a bad David Blaine vanish where I can only assume she is trying to beat the record for the longest F-U to a customer ever. I am ready for the check. I wait 10 min, 20 min, 30 min!!!! It wasn't a wander around the restaurant and try to avoid my table style FU, it was a go in the back so I have zero chance to pay and leave vanish. 34 minutes later(I timed it) she comes back in, I flag her down for my check. No apology, just silent anger between the two of us. At that point I realized I couldn't even lie and give them a 3 star, because I was going to, even though ALL the food was not good, JUST because I support small family owned businesses. But if that's how you want to treat your customers, then I have no sympathy to treat your establishment with the same \"RESPECT.\""}
{"text":"This place is amazing. First off, the tamale was huge! Much bigger and way better than we were expecting. We got the dinner for two and had so much food left over, it could easily feed three. Everything was perfectly seasoned and cook. The chicken would just fall right off the bone, it was so good. The parking lot is a little difficult to get in and out of but this place is absolutely worth the few extra seconds of driving. The waitress was nice, professional. This place is wonderful, do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it's a bit of a challenge to get into the parking lot, especially if you are headed towards Monroe - or if you didn't notice the direct access to the parking lot and have to turn around. Once you're there, though, you find yourself in a rather cavernous building that looks a bit like an old Shoney's. I suspect a former owner turned it into something of a nightclub, because much of it is now not being used.

The staff is welcoming and attentive without being overbearing, however they do not speak the greatest English, so communication can be a bit of a challenge. Do some pointing and you should be fine.

Among the surprising number of rotisserie chicken places in the Charlotte area, La Cancha stands their ground - the chicken is moist and flavorful, with tasty sauces to boot. Their beans, however, were on the flavorless side, and the calamari app was a bit rubbery (flavor was good, though). The best dish of the night was the yuca - perhaps the best in town.

Unfortunately, we had no sign of the chips and salsa mentioned elsewhere, but we did enjoy the meal, and even though we shared a half chicken and the aforementioned calamari app, still came home with leftovers, so there is plenty of food served."}
{"text":"If your looking for ambience, this is definitely not the place.  Maybe we went on a bad day but the experience was not great and in retrospect we should have left but thought that would have been rude and to our disappointment we stayed there because the reviews were positive.  First, the restaurant only had two family dining in, including us and maybe they do more take out than dine-in but we were forgotten for an extended period.  We ordered the chicken as it was their specialty and the Jalea (deep fried seafood) the chicken was definitely not fresh and barely warm.  The jalea tasted like it was fried in very old oil and not too pleasant.  Again, might have been our misfortune of bad timing or bad day but definitely not a place that we would even give a second chance."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by on a fluke because we were hungry and this restaurant was just at the right place. We haven't much peruvian food but we're so glad we tried it.  We will definitely plan to go back. Great service and food! The best peruvian chicken ever! The cilantro rice was good and the plantains!"}
