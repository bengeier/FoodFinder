{"text":"Surprisingly good food for a hole in the wall! And very very cheap Japanese ! I honestly did not expect much when I ordered take out there.  But it wasn't bad at all. In fact quite good."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was not. Three people came in after me and all got their food before me. Some of them had multiple orders while I had a single order. When I said something to the lady working she said one moment and went to the back to begin making my food so I asked her if I could have a free drink while I wait and she ignored me. Also the price was high compared to other hibachi places I've visited."}
{"text":"Decent hibachi and teriyaki food for the price. Hibachi style beef steak chicken or shrimp comes out fast and it's all pretty delicious. Would recommend for a quick lunch while in Harrisburg"}
{"text":"Tried this place for take out dinner for the first time.  I told the owner that it was my first time. He said \" you won't be disappointed .\"  He was right. Allot of food and it was delicious. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Not Ishi anymore... Its Ichi now, under new owners. They've improved the look of the place, it looks much cleaner. As for the food, we got Hibachi chicken and steak... I must say its was lacking in seasoning. Very plain indeed. The new owners are friendly, so hopefully things will get better as time goes on!!"}
{"text":"1st time here in forever...  New ownership, and they are very friendly.   *amazing sushi, and very decent prices   Give it another try if you haven't been here in a while; you won't regret it.   Xo"}
