{"text":"Was there for Saturday buffet.they ran out of most of the dishes .. We called them 10 minutes before we went there , we we're told they serve dosa, idly vada.. Nothing was there ..."}
{"text":"Went to try Indian cuisine for the first time...super impressed!  Food was absolutely delicious.  All dishes served family style with plenty to share.  Decor was beautiful and music was awesome.  Wait staff needs some help ( no drink refills, had to ask for the bill, etc.) but when you speak with them they are very friendly and eager to please.  Will be going here again soon!"}
{"text":"Being newly opened, was skeptical walking in. Loved every bit of food served. Very authentic taste."}
{"text":"Very good indian food.  Went with a bunch of co-workers and had a variety of food.  I had the chicken biryrani and vegetable samosas - both were delicious and so was the naan.  I tried my friends rogan josh and chicken tikka masala - the rogan josh was very good and the masala was probably one of the best i've had.  Will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Well I must say I was very let down here. After not having good Indian food for a while it appears this period will be prolonged, as the food here is anything but good. Yes, I know buffet foods aren't great, that's why I was really hoping I could order something off the menu. Nope, it's just a buffet.  Although there were a couple of vegan options, none of them were tolerable. Each plate seemed to be bad in it's own unique way. From over cooked to a poor balance of spice, indeed, there was an array of bad to try here.  But it's not all bad. The place looks nice and there is good seating. Also, is all you can eat. For me that meant picking at a couple plates and leaving to go grab a snack elsewhere."}
{"text":"'Spice Cafe' was the very first restaurant I've been to, after getting hitched and moving to Charlotte. Some very good memories in here. Can't help it, if I'm being a bit baised.. :)  On a serious note, we were in Charlotte for about five months and the best 'Chicken Biryani' I've ever tasted is here. If you are in Charlotte, craving for some good Biryani then this is the place to be. The buffet on the weekends is great too.They have a wide variety of both Veg/Non-Veg dishes on the menu.   The serving people(waiters) are usually university students working part time and they are a bit amateur, otherwise the staff is very hospitable and the service is good.  The 'Chef' occasionally hops out of the kitchen to interact with the diners, only during the non-busy hours though.That was cool.  After moving from Charlotte, we've been to several other restaurants and I can still vouch for the best 'Chicken Biryani' here. Definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good however the two stars was for the staff... Very unfriendly almost felt like we were imposing on them and it was a fairly quiet night only on other family in the restaurant."}
{"text":"the worst indian restaurant experience ever - went there on a weekend for the buffet - there was no systematic seating, people walked in, grabbed the plates, and started eating while standing as there was no seating available.  people who were standing in the line are not fools to just stand and wait. people just walked and grabbed seats without considering the line, and the owner didn't seem to acknowledge the fact that there should be a wait and everyone should follow the line system.  I cannot speak about the food as i didn't get a chance to eat there, but i was very put off by the whole arrangement, and left without eating."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in charlotte, they buffet on saturdays is so good, great variety, and food was well prepared, service was good. I am certainly going back again."}
{"text":"Loved the taste of Hyderabad Dum Biryani"}
{"text":"This place is great the food is amazing. and cook the way is suppose to be cooked spicy not bland. Tandoori chicken I couldn't stop eating it goat curry so delicious if you like spicy  flavorful dishes come here you won't be disappointed...."}
{"text":"This place was really good - unfortunately the owner sold his restaurant to a small California based chain - Peacock.    I imagine the owners of Peacock tried to cash in on the immense popularity of Spice Cafe as it was packed on the weekends for their buffet.  Unfortunately, the new Peacock restaurant is TERRIBLE.  The food is disgusting and I imagine they may not be around long..."}
{"text":"This is, in my opinion, one of the best bars in Oakland.  First off, it's pretty divey, so if you want to see the people you're talking to, forget it.  It's basement location makes for a great hideaway on weekdays, and karaoke and cover bands make it pretty busy otherwise.  The beer selection is great and cheap, with daily specials on some nice craft beers.  The bartenders here are quick and pour drinks that could kill a man with low tolerance, so beware.  I once got a \"shot\" of Jager here that was a full rocks glass.    Overall, this is a bar with a dual personality.  Nice and quiet on weekdays (minus karaoke, which I think is Thursday), and busy and fun after 11 on weekends.  I think it does both of these roles exceedingly well...I'm surprised I'm not there more, to be honest!"}
{"text":"We tried cut chilli with old monk beer we liked it very much....."}
{"text":"I would appreciate these guys for doing a Unlimited Dosa night - it's a bold move . I went early evening and was served with close to 5 dosas , I was unable to finish all of them though , sides were awesome , especially the red chutney ( tomato) . Plain Dosa - good  Paneer Dosa - not so good as panner was plain could have added some masala n some salt . Kal Dosa - pretty big , for unlimited dosa  Uthappam - was not so cooked on the middle, but was good .(big one ) They took sometime to serve dosa .  My advise to chef - please don't serve chutneys right from fridge , doesnot taste good . Otherwise you are doing a good job . Please advertise this dosa night more , so that everyone get to try them !  ( good strategy needs good marketing too ) , will come again sometime next month for more dosas .   For anyone who does not what dosa is - it's rice crepe , it's crispy and yummy served with different sides - sambar , chutneys and podi . Masala dosa is stuffed wih mash potatoes (Indian style)"}
{"text":"By far, the worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant.   I ordered a dish for take out and was given the wrong dish. I didn't find out until I got home, so I called them to let them know I was given the wrong dish. The rude manager/owner proceeded to blame me and tell me both dishes were \"the same thing.\" I am Indian and make this specific dish often so I know there is a difference. He ended up taking my name and promising me a free dish on my next visit.  I decided to give them another try and ordered samosas. This place charges $10 for only four samosas. Anyone that has been to an Indian restaurant know that this is quite expensive! I reminded the owner that he promised me a free dish on my next visit to make up for his mistake and he refused. He blamed me again and said he would not give me a free dish. I ended up paying and vowing to never return to that place ever again.  Do yourself a favor and don't go to this place. The food is a 5/10 and the service is even worse.   Shame on you, Spice Cafe."}
{"text":"First visit to spice cafe!! Heard it was great!  My fork and taste buds will let me know!!!! Ordered take out.  Chicken Tikka Masala...veggie vada, plain naan.  I will have to return for Chicken Biryani."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch buffet was great!  More options than I expected and everything I tried was delicious.  The only problem was the service.  One lone employee was trying to seat customers, serve drinks, clear tables, and bring people their checks.  He was polite and constantly moving, but it was far too much for one person to keep up with.  There was a sign in the window that they are hiring, so perhaps more employees will improve the service."}
{"text":"I don't know why Spice gets overlooked when people are considering the best college bars in Oakland. Every time I've been there the night has ended well.  Their drink specials (posted on little menus at the bar and on banners) are hilariously girly but reasonably priced and will knock you on your ass. I had a \"Shut Up and Drink\" which was a sweet concoction of fruit-flavored rums and mixed fruit juices. I hate to admit to drinking it, but the bartender didn't skimp on the alcohol and yet I could barely taste any. I was randomly singing Lady Gaga's \"Poker Face\" within 20 minutes, which is always a good sign. They have a nice draft selection and beer specials all the time.  The bartenders are friendly here, unlike the nearby Peter's Pub and PCafe. We went once on a Wednesday night and the bartender taught us how to mix drinks and let us pick the music without paying for the jukebox! We also got a few free drinks. He hit on my friend a bit, but I can't really blame him for that.  This place never seems too packed, even on the busy Karaoke nights. You never have to wait too long for a drink either. I'd much rather spend a night here then wait 30 minutes for a shot at Peter's.   Overall, great service and good prices makes this my favorite college bar in Oakland. Try it instead of PCafe/Peter's/whatever one night, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Someone in the world HAD to write a good review of this place. Thursday night was date night, and my wife and I like to try new places. I found a LivingSocial coupon to Spice Cafe and we had talked about getting Indian food for weeks, so I thought let's give it a try.  What a gem. Being open less than 3 months, the outside was very DIY but the inside was very nice, good seating, nice nooks, very clean, very family friendly. There was not a soul in the place. We sat down and looked over the menu, our server didn't speak much English which is always a good sign for delicious and authentic cuisine.  The wine was served out of mini-bottles (not my favorite selection, but cute for the setting). The menu was at least 6 pages long, and I'm sure they could cook anything to curry perfection.   We ordered a tandoori chicken appetizer, followed by garlic naan and a lamb curry dish that was sizable enough for two, and a side of jasmine rice. We opted out of dessert as we were filled to the brim (and I've never personally cared for Indian sweets). I have to admit however, that my wife is not a fan of very spicy foods, so we order mild dishes, though I'm sure Spice Cafe can bring the heat if that is what you are in to.  By the time we were finished, there were a handful of families sitting around all of which seemed to have connections with one another. It was a perfect discovery.  I give it a 4 and not a 5 only because of the less than ideal location and ambience for a perfect date nigth, but word on the street is they have a great lunch buffet, and would be a good spot for dinner with friends.  Next time I visit: on my plate will be the lamb samosas to start and a variety of curry dishes with roti for entree to share among friends."}
{"text":"Hands down!! The best Indian cuisine in Charlotte, NC!! And believe me, I've looked!  I heart this place!!"}
{"text":"I think there is a law in America that all Indian restaurants must have a lunch buffet. In accordance with said law, as I walked up to Spice Cafe on my lunch break I was greeted by an A-frame telling me the buffet was $8.95. Sounded about right, so in I went.  The buffet boasted a good amount of choices, a few more than the slightly cheaper one at Passage to India. The standout was the Paneer in...pinkish orange... sauce. They had a fish curry that I really wanted to like (mostly so I could write about how much I loved the fish curry) but it was (unsurprisingly) overly fishy. The naan was a little crispy for my liking but had good flavor.  Some of the waitstaff was a little green (It took a few tries to run the gentleman in front of me's credit card since he was a First Last, III) but i can forgive this. It was also dark, like noticeably dark, which was odd. I'll have to come back when they aren't doing a buffet (and perhaps hav ethe lights turned up) to see what kind of spice they can really turn out, but for a lunch when my tummy is really rumbling, they are going on the list of options for sure."}
{"text":"Spice is easily the best college bar in Oakland.  Twas my favorite dive in college, and I didn't understand why more of my friends weren't into it...Wait, oh yeah, this isn't a big hook-up spot.  But, anyway.  Here's what I loved about Spice when I was a wee student: -The drinks were CHEAP and there was always a special. Long Island pitchers for $4 or $1 liquor drinks.  For $4 or less, the beer selection ranged from PBR to Blue Moon to Miller Lite to Sunset Wheat. -They never charged a cover, even when they had live bands, which were generally decent enough local jam bands. -They had several game machines, and I'm a sucker for round of \"Photo Hunt.\" -There was dart board AND it hung in a place where it was nearly impossible for drunkies to walk in front of it while playing.  (Take note, Gene's.) -The karaoke night was always entertaining (and I generally dislike karaoke).  If the singing was bad, the karaokers would dance and bounce around. -It would be packed with black & yellow during Pens game and there were several TV's.  The only minuses are that the stairs can get super slippy in bad weather and that the crowd is mostly undergrads...so I'm too grown up now for this jam!"}
{"text":"Used to be good, not any more.                                                                       Though this restaurant is expensive when compared to others, the taste and quality used to be good. I was left with nightmare  on my recent visit. We ordered special chicken 65 and chicken biryani.  chicken 65: Too much of food color and didn't taste good at all.  Chicken biryani: I strongly believe that it's was the leftover for morning buffet.. Rice was mashed up, and wet.."}
{"text":"Another buffet spot to add to the Indian scene in the university area.  I didn't see a menu so I think they offer the buffet all day everyday, of course I could be wrong.  The restaurant is laid out very nicely which was quite impressive, however I found the limited buffet to be just ok.  I like more of a variety and Spice Cafe just didn't deliver for me on this visit.  I realize they're still pretty new so I'll give them another try in a couple of months in hopes that they add a bit more to choose from."}
{"text":"A la carte is the soooo much better than the buffet. It's pricey but more flavorful. The best Indian restaurant in town. Go spice cafe...try mutton, malai kofta n pepper shrimp...yum yum yum  Dosa'sare awesome too!!!"}
{"text":"Incredibly sweet staff and excellent food. Closest to Indian flavors since I went to India."}
{"text":"yummy food!!! This is the resturant that my boyfriend and I went to on our first date.   I have been going here since I was a freshmen in college, and it's still  very tasty. The even had a bagpipe musician in there a couple of saint patricks days ago. lol who does that.  It's a fun resturant for groups too.  Although I have never had any alcohalic beverages here, there drink specials are well advertised .  On my last visit I had steak fajitas and so tasty and sizzling hot. The steak was perfectly season and the veggies had a nice char on them. They were serverd in a little cast iron skillet which I thought was cute and exciting.  I am going to take off one star because our server was on a cordless phone for most of the time we were there. I felt that was a tad unperfessonal.  Good food, good prices."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price, expect the owner is a dick who is comically oblivious to how customer service works within the restaurant industry, don't even get me started.. almost every time I go there's an issue with the owner"}
{"text":"Posh looking interior does not make up for the higher than average prices for Indian food in Charlotte. The Dosa tasted like sourdough!"}
{"text":"We just had an amazing lunch here.  Gobi Manchurian was very tasty and for our entree we had malai chicken that was delicious.  Highly suggest it."}
{"text":"They have a really good lunch buffet on weekends. I went here on one Saturday for lunch. I am quite satisfied by the number of dishes and quality of dishes.  The veg biryani is great. The okhra curry is delicious. I like that they had pani puri and all the stuff to make pani puris. The dosas are nice.  I would recommend this place. As a vegetarian, this is a decent place for a nice lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Dark bar with cheap drinks sing, get wasted and smoke cigs then fall up crazy stairs."}
{"text":"For bars in Oakland near the universities it gets no better than Spice Cafe. This bar actually caters to people other than the newly 21 crowd like nearby Hemingway's, Peter's Pub, and Garage Door. Don't get me wrong, this place still gets its fair share of college students but the staff here really gets to know you and cares more about making sure their patrons have a good time and not just making money.   Here are the reasons Spice Cafe rules:   Live bands with no cover charge...EVER. -- sure they aren't the best bands you've ever heard, but they all get the dance floor rocking and with the tiny stage so close to the dance floor it is really intimate.   Cheap ass drinks -- this place is so cheap I can't fathom how they can turn a profit. Seriously...miller light is always 1.50, and they have a daily micro brew special for around 2 dollars. well drinks and shots are 2.50 and are poured so strong that you can hardly stand after two. And if you really want to get the party going get a frozen long island iced tea for 5.00. Don't have more than one or you will black out.   Awesome Jukebox -- Great music is always pumping from this thing. stuff you wouldn't hear anywhere else; deep cuts from little known Neil Young albums, Zevon, and then to mix it up you will hear some early 90's rap from the likes of A tribe called quest and stuff like that. Since they changed the jukebox to the newer internet jukebox thing some of the music has become a bit more mainstream and trendy, but it's still better than any other bar in Oakland.   Great staff--Pya and Yassir were the best managers in the city and them leaving has left a hole in many a yinzer's heart. But the new management is doing great things with pub quiz night and continuation of Karaoke. The bouncer Tom is one of the friendliest people you will ever meet as long as you arent acting like a total tool.   The Bad stuff.....   The only gripe I have is that though they have a huge draft selection every now and then you will get a skunky beer. Just take it back and the staff will make it right by giving you a another drink at no charge and maybe even throwing in a shot if you seem like a good person. Get the draft beer selection fixed and this place would get 5 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Best Biryani in Charlotte, a bit on the spicier side. Their lunch buffet is also quite good for the price."}
{"text":"I have tried almost all Indian buffets around Charlotte now. There are only two places that I like(out of about 7 that I tried). The best thing about spice cafe is the diversity of the menu. I see Indian restaurants in us( I have been to a couple of states) the menus are mostly oriented to north Indian cuisine.  Trust me Indian cuisine is lot more diverse. Have u tried Andhra chicken curry with white rice , dont be scared by its spice level by looking at it, mix it with enough rice, have u tried Chennai mutton kolambu with rice!!!! (My fav) . Have you tried South Indian style Okra fry. Oh in Summer dont forget to try the \"More(butter-milk) kolambu\" the best body coolant.   I will repeat again. But I guess entrée are bit pricey here compared to other indian restaurants and I do believe the . If you want to try an authentic taste of diverse indian( & close to authentic for few dishes) then do visit this place.   My next review will be the jaipur indian restaurant. I equally like jaipur."}
{"text":"Ummm... why are there only 2 reviews for this place?? Slackin...  Anyway, i agree with Chad and Paul. One of the best! I jumped up my 21st birthday here and we ALL  thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The drinks are decently priced and definitely pack the punch. I have probably been at least 8 times after that while I was up at school.  If i had to recommend a drink, get the NERD with a touch of red syrup and cherry. Just watch dude make it, it will shock and amaze you and it tastes nothing like alcohol (which is the dangerous part hehe)  The wings are good too. Get the Kitchen Sink and BBQ of course, of course!"}
