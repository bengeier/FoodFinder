{"text":"They boast flavor but they lacked flavor. 

The chips have a little salt on it but I would've expected something powerful like a smoky salt or something with some fire in it. What do they think is so special about these?

The burger had quality but again lack that punch of flavor. How do they think their burger stands out against others?  I did like the bun compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"I'll be honest - I only went to this food truck over the other food trucks parked on Walnut Wednesday because the cashier taking orders was extremely cute. Sweating profusely, I walked towards the cashier and asked her what she recommended. She said the 'High Rise Burger' - without a second thought or glance at the menu, I acquiesced and ordered it.

The high rise burger ($10) was delicious although my senses may have been clouded by thoughts of the cashier. Succulent pulled pork piled on top of a fresh beef patty with onions and slaw. The beef patty was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of texture and juice. Tasted like being at a summer cookout in the backyard.

I came to learn that it was their first day ever at Walnut Wednesday and it is run by an ex-firefighter chef. Cool looking truck, yummy food and cute cashier. Go to Firehouse grilling co next time you see their truck around!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I'm not sure why there's ANY bad reviews of this food truck.  

My husband and I visited this truck during a recent trip to Cedar Point during opening weekend.  The park itself was poorly staffed so food stands hand lines longer than some of the roller coasters (not even kidding).  We had passed by this food truck a couple times and said \"nah, let's go find a burger and fries somewhere cheap.\"  We ended up talking to the owner of the food truck (ex - fire company worker) and decided to try the place out.  

My husband ordered a burger and I ordered a hot dog with pulled pork and cole slaw on it.  Each order came with fresh cut potato chips.  My husband loved his burger and my hot dog was amazing.  The combination of pulled pork and slaw was just right.  

We loved our meal so much that we came back a few minutes later and ordered a bourbon brownie.  Yep - it's just what it sounds like and it's amazing.  

We will DEFINITELY be back to this truck if we ever see them at Cedar Point again.  The prices are on par with any other park food you'd order except your money is spent going towards a local business."}
