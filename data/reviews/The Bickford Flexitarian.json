{"text":"Pretty sure this place is closed. Went there today during business hours, everything is shut down, no food in the fridge and the phone line is disconnected.  If they ARE still open, they obviously don't care enough to show up within an hour and a half of opening."}
{"text":"Their purple kale slaw with capers rocks my effin' socks right off. It's toooo  delicious.   One of the few places I know everyone will be sated from carnivorous turophiles to rawists, they got your dietary bases covered!  Also: the raw truffles are yum!  Can't wait 'til they get their liquor license. I expect some fun, almost healthy cocktails!"}
{"text":"The owners of this wonderful place opened the restaurant in the hopes of offering customers really tasty vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. If it's not too busy, I recommend chatting with the owners of this family-run place (a brother and a sister). I love that I can take my veggie and vegan friends here and still have a filling, healthy, carniverous meal myself. Standouts to me are their sandwiches (I order whatever the staff suggests and they've never steered me wrong!), the kale slaw (sooooooo good!) and the vegan treats are very tasty (though not all created equal, some were amazing, others were just so-so). I was less impressed with their brunch (my french toast was OK) although my hubby loved his omelette and my hot chocolate really hit the spot. If you're looking for light, fresh food, smart-sized portions and really excellent service, you should pop by!"}
{"text":"Whether you are flexitarian, vegetarian, vegan or eat meat, the Bickford Flexitarian has a menu to meet everyone's needs. With a moderate menu, they cater mostly to the breakfast and brunch crowd (they close at 6pm). They have ample vegan options. Along with almond and soy milk, you can order tofu, vegg (vegan egg supplement) and mozzarella or cheddar vegan cheese.  My friend and I were looking for a place to work over breakfast. When we found out that they didn't have wifi, we considered going somewhere else. In the end, we were both satisfied with our decision to stay.  I had the Gingseng Latte to drink and the Portobello and Arugula Pesto Omelette to eat. I ordered everything vegan, with vegg, vegan cheese and almond milk. The latte was slightly sweet but not over powering. The omelette was quite impressive. I have never had vegg, as most restaurants supplement eggs with tofu. I am often disappointed by vegan cheese and was surprised to find out they use Daiya (although I hear it is the best vegan cheese, in the past I did not find it an adequate replacement). The combination of ingredients created a delicious omelette, replicating the same texture as real eggs and melted cheese. It was accompanied by 2 slices of baguette and a small portion of fresh fruit. The portion of the meal was just right; enough to satisfy my appetite, yet it did not leave me uncomfortably full.  To top it all off, the service was excellent. I was very happy that I chose to stay and look forward to returning to try the lunch menu."}
{"text":"The Bickford Flexitarian is a great spot for all types of diets. I'm vegan and would love to bring my carnivore family there. There is something for everyone.  I went there a couple of weeks ago on a Sunday for brunch and there was only one other party! I suppose it's because it's new, I assumed it was going to be packed. I ordered the vegan banana crepes. Very tasty! Affordable too! My only critique is the portion size, it's too small but I guess that reflects the cost.  They also did not have the type of tea I wanted but our wait staff apologized and gave us his personal suggestions, which I liked.  We got some vegan sweets to go. For two people we paid around $30, that included drinks, a main and treats- pretty good as far as vegan food in this city goes!  Up the portion sizes and they would get five stars from me!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the Bickford Park area. Awesome healthy brunch, lunch, and coffee. I love the daily soup, the smoked chicken omelet, and the spiced mocha. A real pleasant outing."}
{"text":"it's good! smaller portions that you're probably used to, but the price reflects it. also, the quality is there so what you miss out on in portion size you make up for in quality. most places give you too much food, in my opinion anyway. we only tried two things (buttermilk waffles and cheddar omelette), but are excited to go back and try more! i love seeing vegan items on a menu (especially when they're not vegan-by-default) even though i'm not vegan.... there's something for everyone, really. it's sunny and a little austere, but the service was friendly and relaxed."}
{"text":"This place is great in terms of finding somewhere omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans can eat. However I would never return to eat there. The portions are much too small. I understand that they are sensible portions which are probably what we should be eating. When I go out to eat, I want large positions. I eat sensible portions at home so I want to treat myself at restaurants.   The food was just ok. Basic items I could easily make myself."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Bickford Flex! I've tried a bunch of things here: the breakfast sandwich (super tasty), the omelet (also very good, but quite a small serving size), the cauliflower salad (not too bad..probably wouldn't have it again), and a number of the pastries (ummm..yeah...I've had a number of them...as in I've lost count...as in I keep going back because they're amazing..yeah).   I really like the layout of the Bickford Flex. I like the feel in there and the music they play. I don't like that there's no wifi. That's kind of a bummer. But the food is good!   If you live nearby, you should def check it out. I'm sure you'll feel the same way as I do (that it's worth your time) and visit it often. They're also starting up a dinner menu in the new year!"}
{"text":"There are two ways a restaurant can win my heart. One is to have a good selection of vegan options. More than just the non-vegan options without the non-vegan ingredients, or the cliche pasta primavera or anything with a mushroom in place of meat. I mean actually thoughtful, well-executed vegan dishes.  The second way is to offer quality ingredients at an affordable price. The Bickford Flexitarian has both these things. Lots of vegan options and some gluten-free ones as well and they are not mutually exclusive (ie, if you're an allergy-less, you won't get stuck with gluten-free bread you didn't want).  This brings me to the Fried Vegg sandwich. It's a vegan omelette with Daiya cheddar, pickled onions, heirloom tomatoes, spinach inside of lovely, fresh made bread from Woodlot. At $6.75, it's a quality breakfast without breaking the bank and the perfect amount of food for me. I'm not a big eater in the AM.  On top of that, they have good coffee and friendly service. Next up to try are the vegan waffles and banana crepes.  If you're not familiar with the word flexitarian, it basically means an omnivore diet that leans heavily towards vegan and vegetarian food. Some include pescatarianism in this as well. I say you can't call yourself a flexitarian unless at least 3/4 of your meals are vegan or at the very least meat-free. You're just an omnivore if you eat meat and dairy every day, stop kidding yourself. To be clear, a flexitarian is not a type of vegetarian, so please don't get them confused. Neither is a pescatarian. They're all omnivores. They're just doing it better than most omnivores.  Bickford has something to please everyone, at the most difficult meal of the day. I'm still blown away that I can even get a vegan breakfast sandwich anywhere in this city before 9am! Bike on over and try it out."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful but the portions were extremely small.   My one beef was that we had a group of people getting brunch and we were drinking drip coffee. I asked for a refill and the waitress asked if anyone else wanted a refill and proceeded to refill everyone's coffee.  I understand for fancier coffee that refills are not free but for just regular drip coffee it usually is. They will also TELL you if that's not the case. She said nothing, refilled the entire table and charged our table close to $25 for refills. It was pretty bullshit."}
{"text":"The Bickford Flexitarian is a new-ish restaurant focusing on producing quality food catering to vegetarians, vegans and omnivores alike. I was sold on the menu instantly and decided to pop in for brunch with my boyfriend.   The interior is simple and clean -- you walk in and seat yourself at one of their booth-style tables. There's seating for probably 20 or so inside, and it was pretty full at 10am on a Sunday morning. The menu offers lots of options from sweet to savoury, and I decided to order the Fried Egg Sandwich ($6.75) while he had the Omelette with Chicken, Spinach and Goat Cheese ($8.25). Definitely agree with other reviews that portions are on the smaller side -- this isn't a \"hungry man\" kind of place. My sandwich came out with a small side of coleslaw and his omelette came with two small pieces of toast and a tiny cup of fruit. I thought the food was tasty, well presented and fairly priced for the quality of the meal.  Overall, service was friendly and well-executed. Would be interested in trying their lunch menu to see how that stacks up against their breakfast options. Toronto needs more quality vegetarian food!"}
