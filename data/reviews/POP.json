{"text":"Adorable place with fresh juices and yummy macaroons! The smoothie I had was good just a little more sweetness would have made it great. Overall enjoyed and will be back."}
{"text":"Dang, that's delicious. Got the Punk'd Up Smoothie with added hemp protein. Their healthy answer to the pumpkin spice latte, this smoothie contains pumpkin butter, banana, spices, almond milk, maple syrup and an extra serving of yum. Stop in just to check out the awesome bathroom wallpaper! The whole place has fun style, designed to give you a lift. It's a super cute little spot tucked downstairs on Portland that's so committed to using organics they won't carry cold pressed juice brands that can't guarantee their ingredients are organic. That Nenad prices are high, but so is quality I guess. Happy to see they're on Ritual and Foodora too, so I won't have to wait to enjoy a protein bowl, salad, soup or acai bowl. Even just reading their menu gives me a ton more energy!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. I've been a few times, did not know what it was all about until I went inside. Chill vibes a good place to hang out, good smoothies. I'm not a juice bar person and  never went to one but this place appeals. Friendly people behind the counter."}
