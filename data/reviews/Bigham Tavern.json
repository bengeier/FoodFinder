{"text":"Love this place.  Today was not the best. First time we've ordered off the brunch menu. Party of 7. Drinks and entrees only. Service was very slow and spotty. 3 drinks ordered, 1 would come at a time. Bloody Mary's with no olives... Boo! Food was extremely slow and also came out randomly. And COLD. I'm sure my breakfast BLT would have been so much better had it not been cold.  Then the NIT tournament was on but we finally flagged someone down. Asked for separate checks they were all wrong. left without saying anything because business really picked up and no one was around."}
{"text":"I've come here a lot in the past couple of months. Their brunch is top notch. I ordered an all American burger today, medium. my burger came out well done, burned on one side, and without bacon. I didn't complain but left 3/4 of my burger on my plate. bartender didn't even ask how it was, just if I was done. meanwhile the dude next to me had said something about their overdone burger and had it remade to have it be overdone again. I don't think I will order their burgers in the future."}
{"text":"Really liked! I got a build your own burger which was ok but i think if i would have gotten one listed that had a lot of fixings it would of been amazing. Mac and cheese was also good. Homemade potato chips were so good especially dipped in ranch. We had the pretzel sticks for an appetizer, the beer cheese dip was the best cheese dip i've had. The only thing is i'd suggest to not eat outside because the flies were quite annoying. There was a guy singing for the night, he wasn't good whatsoever. I found the food made up for the loud music and flies though. Good service too! Also the prices were really fair, like a side of homage chips was a dollar and the portion was big. I'll probably be back!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Bigham. I've been taking friends and family here for a year now and it's always top notch. The food is great, and the service is phenomenal. Special kudos to Les, the chef, and Sarah at the bar for being so welcoming and attentive. Their wings are excellent and they have a great selection of flavors. Skip the fancier places on Pittsburgh Restaurant Week and get yourself a terrific four (five, really) course meal. Do yourself a favor and give this hidden gem on the Mount a try!"}
{"text":"THE SECOND BEST RESTAURANT EVER!!!
(The first is Noodles and Company in MD)
I live in Maryland but I have been to Pittsburgh a couple of times. We saw the other good Yelps and started to head here from the Mon incline. It was a trek but about the food. I had Mac and cheese which was exceptional and so were the wings. The power went out at the towards the end of our meal because the generator blew across the street but it was still the second best restaurant in America!!!"}
{"text":"Super good grub! My friend and I got fried pickles and the nacho can to split. The fried pickles were some of the best I've ever had, and the nachos were amazing (albeit a little too salty for me, but my friend loved them!!!). I got. Chicken strips and my friend got taco Mac, we both loved our meals! A little pricy, but totally worth it. Would come back any time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Great staff. Multiple TVs showing every game. Good food. And John comes in on Thursdays and does a great trivia and karaoke night. What more could you ask for from a neighborhood bar?"}
{"text":"had an awesome happy hour here today! Sarah, the bartender, was absolutely amazing and took great care of us. sometimes a pittsburgh staple like Bigham will blow you away with a certain server or bartender that just makes the night so memorable. a true hidden gem in the city that makes you want to keep coming back for more. thank you Sarah, and thank you Bigham for making this day a great day :)"}
{"text":"Hangover burger will make you look forward to feeling like next morning sh*t. Homemade tots are the bomb too. Extensive beer list.
Go here. Now."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for several years now and it's only gotten worse. The service is horrendous. Tonight it took over an hour to get two sandwiches...one of which was overcooked and the fries with the other were undercooked. I've given it the benefit of the doubt and continue to come back but every time I've come here over the last few months I've had the same experience. It's a shame since the food normally is decent but apparently they don't care about good service. I think I might have to completely give up on this place because it's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food here is absolutely delicious most of the time. 

However this place is way overpriced these days. Add in the fact that their drinks are watered down and sad... not a very good tavern.

Get takeout once and awhile but otherwise vote with your wallet... this place is overpriced and nickel and dimes you. No thanks"}
{"text":"I have had pretty good experiences with Bigham in the past, but apparently they're making some changes for the worse.  My friends and I came up the other night for the Pens game, about an hour early to find that they started doing their seating system differently.  

We waited for 2 hours for a table. Meanwhile, for the first hour, half of the tables were open.  We were told the kitchen was backed up, which is fine, we just wanted to sit.  There was a large crowd and we were in the way of everyone.

Not to mention, after an hour or waiting, they seated a party of 2 and a party of 3 in two of the biggest seating areas they have.  They told us the number of our party size didn't matter... up until they ran out of seating.  Then it was \"oh, we don't have any room for a party that size now\".

Our group has come to this bar during several games and other wing nights just as busy in the past and we have never had any issues until this new arrangement they're doing.  We all agreed that we will be taking our business elsewhere for future games and events."}
{"text":"Grilled Romaine salad is delicious - grilled romaine with bacon, blue cheese, tomatoes, onions, a hard boiled egg and citrus vinaigrette!  It's the salad of the week."}
{"text":"There were 5 of us that went to the Bigham yesterday for drinks and dinner. The food was great! I had the home made tots and Mediterranean pizza. Both were good I favored the tots. Our server was awesome she had a smile on her face the whole time. Great personality! I went to smoke outside and when I returned I had come to find out a joke they played on me. My daughter told the server she was putting the ketchup and mustard bottle in my purse while it was left open. Then our server (I wish I could remember her name) asked when I returned where did my ketchup bottle go as her eyes glanced at my purse. I wanted to die. My face got beet red as a removed it to place back on the table while I was saying I don't know how that got In there.. We all had a good laugh. Thanks for the hospitality and going along with a funny joke..love the Bigham!"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat! My boyfriend and I were in town and just happened to come across this place. The food was excellent and our service was great. The prices are very reasonable and you will not leave hungry. There were some Friday night specials going on which was nice. Also, the restaurant had a special menu for the Lenten season on Fridays with many fish dinner options. 

My boyfriend got a burger and Mac and cheese as a side. I had the fish tacos with sweet potato fries (waffle style). He had a drink and we order a Friday 5 dollar appetizer special. Our bill was right under 35 dollars. I would totally recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Not really my typical type of place, as this is quite a sport atmosphere, but I love Bigham Tavern! Any night of the week is a good night to go, though expect a wait during busy times, like Wednesday wing night. 

They have so many awesome wing flavors, and the wings are delicious! I also like their salads and sandwiches as well. The beer choices were pretty excellent as well, and they had some cool cocktails on their menu to boot! 

Everything is reasonably priced, and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"Been there a couple times now and I think it's a good place to go in the Mt. Washington area. Wide selection of beers. Since they are pretty known in the area for their wing night it tends to get busy but I guess the wings are pretty good (my boyfriend got some). The first time I was there I got a chicken sandwich and, while it was tasty, it was a bit salty. The other three people in our party agreed. The second time I was there I thought everything was seasoned just right. Casual. Good place to hang out with friends and watch a game!"}
{"text":"I loved their fried pickles a lot. And they have great burghers too. The thing stopped me going back is their service. I had several bad experiences there. The first time was we were on the waiting list and their system just messed up and we almost couldn't sit after 1.5h wait because their system was showing that we signed up 5mins ago which is obvious not true. And that was almost 9pm. Btw, this happened at the wing night. The second time was the waitress, she showed no care about our table, like help us order after 30mins waiting, keep forgetting to fill up our beers etc. the third time was when I try to call in to order some takeout, the waitress answered my call and told me hold for a minute. I waited couple minutes and she started to get my order, while I was still trying to tell her what do I want, she picked up another phone call tell them to hold for a sec, then come back which I was fine with it. So I kept going, before I finish my order, she just start to talk on the other line and taking another order while I am able to hear everything, after a little bit, she put me on hold!!! That was very rude!! I understand they probably busy, but at least you have to show some respect and let me finished my order or let me know if you are having an emergency. I will be totally cool. But this is out of line, they are not going to have any business from me, my family and my friends! If they keep treating people with no respect, hard to make people come back."}
{"text":"This place actually has really great food! They have an awesome brunch, and the pretzel sticks are amazing!! They also have a lot of TVs so great for football games! My only complaint is that it is really really loud there at times!"}
{"text":"Best wings in Pittsburgh. I tried them everywhere and they simply cannot be beat at Bigham. Vast selection to choose from as well, so you're bound to find something you like. You also may want to try the Hot Cheese Bites with ranch, mmmmm."}
{"text":"Seriously the best wings in Pittsburgh. I have eaten a lot of wings but bigham tavern pretty much blows everyone else out of the water. As long as I live in the city I will be a wing night regular. Hot garlic is the best"}
{"text":"I've been here many times as our beer league team made this the \"go to\" after games. They have a great selection of wings and specials on buckets of beers. I have only eaten here a handful of times and not gotten wings but I've never had a bad meal here, everything I tried was good. Great place to watch a game and their patio is a nice chill spot in the summer if you're with a group...Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Wings, Wings and more Wings. This is a great place to kick back and watch your favorite team or just enjoy the music and have a good time with friends.  The selection of wings has something for everyone.   They even have a few unpublished flavors.   I sampled the dry rub selection and was very satisfied.  I definitely recommend this place. The service gets two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food although I've heard great things! Drinks are cheap and strong and our waitress, Liz (Lizard), is lovely, efficient, knowledgeable and charming. The outdoor tent area is perfect for a Tuesday night drink!"}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for a softball tournament and took nearly our entire team and parents to Bigham after we were done for the day. Everyone loved their meals. With 25 of us there we did a pretty expansive sampling of the menu to rave reviews all around. The wing sauces are really great and I wish I could have bought some in a bottle to take home. If you're looking for a great reasonably priced sports bar this should be your go to place in Pittsburgh. Thanks for the great service and great food."}
{"text":"Great elevated bar food. Good place to watch a game or just hang out. My biggest complaint would be service occasionally. Especially during wing night."}
{"text":"The food here is AWESOME!!!!  AWESOME!  But the downside is, and it's a really big downside for me as I have a sensitivity to loud noises, is that it's really loud. I've never been in the bar section, I can't imagine how loud it is in there, but even for a weeknight dinner I could barely hear the people at my table and kept having to ask them to repeat themselves. Too bad, because like I said before, the food is out of this world. I've switched to getting take-out from Bigham Tavern because I want the food but don't want to sit in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my go to bar and I love their Wednesday Wing Nights. I always get 12 wings, ranch, a basket of fries, and a beer for a total of $10 SO pretty cheap. The ladies are always so sweet and after 10pm they have a man checking ID's. All other food is amazing but their wings r by far the best. They have a outside area they just opened also. If you live in the area or in Mount. Washington stop by."}
{"text":"This is a great local bar nestled in the hills of Mt Washington.  I've been going here for years because the beer is cold and the wings are remarkable.  I was there last evening and the place was packed (Wed wing night.)  I would give this establishment 5 stars but it did take over an hour and half to be seated and get our food.  I highly recommend going on a different night if you want the wings--don't be a cheap ass.  Also, the baskets of curly fries continue to get smaller and smaller and not worth the $4 price tag."}
{"text":"best bar in pittsburgh!!!  top notch food for bar food and great selection of booze.

please expand so we don't have a long wait on game day ;)"}
{"text":"This is a great local spot, but as a non local it was pretty hard to get service, I got the # 1 which was delicious, I would still give it another try on my next visit."}
{"text":"Such a great place to grab a bite to eat. My friend who was apartment hunting up in Mt. Washington found this spot on yelp so we gave it a go. Great service, good portion for the price you pay, cold draft beer (properly poured). I got the chicken wrap and my friend got the wings, both were yummy. It's now her favorite spot for drinks and we'll be going tonight to meet up with some friends. There's also a separate seating area that is enclosed separately from the bar for families."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times in the past and it was always great. A few weeks ago we had a friend in town and were really excited to take her there for brunch. Unfortunately we had a really bad experience and probably won't return. It took over an hour an a half to get our food... When I asked our waitress if she knew how much longer it was going to be she said our order should be out very shortly. I had considered leaving money on the table for my drink and leaving, but since we had a friend in town and were starving and had already waited this long, what's another five mins. About 25 mins later and 2 tables that came in a good 45 mins after us being served, our food FINALLY came. My order was wrong and when the correct dish came out, it really wasn't that good. Some dry potatoes and an over easy egg that wasn't even dippy. Definitely not worth the money or the 2 1/2 hours we spent there.... Waiting. The manager comped our $8 app, (which the pierogies  were really good, maybe because we were so hungry.) But the manager never came over to our table to see what the problem was or to try and resolve the issue."}
{"text":"My friends are obsessed with this place and go here often for the bar scene. Good selection of booze overall.
I'm giving it 3 stars because the food was super good (get the buffalo chicken quesadilla - you won't regret it), but the service was slow. After reading other reviews I guess that in that regard it is usually a hit or miss. Definitely worth the time it takes you to find a parking space."}
{"text":"First time at this place today. It was amazing. There were so many delicious options for brunch. I couldn't decide between pierogies or chicken and waffles. I ended up picking chicken and waffles and it was delicious. Unfortunately, I cannot give 5 stars whereas the service was slow."}
{"text":"Very nice. Friendly atmosphere, friendly server. My husband had the hangover cure burger and he recommends it  I had the pot roast Mac n cheese and I recommend it ."}
{"text":"Had a rodeo burger , wich was made from ground aged sirloin . Toppings were fried onion ring , sliced cheddar cheese,  and  smokey bbq sauce on it with a side of curly fries. It was great my burger travels will continue"}
{"text":"What a great spot! I'm not from Pittsburgh, but I am surprised that I don't hear more about this place!! The service and food were both phenomenal!! 

We ordered:
Big hammy mac - if you love macaroni & cheese, you will love it! I can't wait to go back and try more. It has just the right amount of all the ingredients (meat & cheese & pasta). 
The wings were also great! The sauces were finger-licking good, so definitely recommend those as well! 

I really can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I know so far I always have given good reviews... however... I really love this place.. the food is excellent and is great for me because I only live a block away.. the only problem I have with the place is that it needs to be bigger.. they need to have two bars.. makes me claustrophobic..  Also they have craft beers.. enjoy the Bigham.. I know I sure have"}
{"text":"We waited more than 45 minutes for wings and fries. The wings were lukewarm. The fries were soggy. Our friends ordered a veggie wrap and veggie burger. They were also cold. The server didn't give a crap, never mind apologize. It was also uncomfortably loud. We couldn't hear each other speak then, and we can't hear anyone speak now.

 How did the food taste? Who knows? We were too hangry to care.

(This was the first restaurant we went to in Pittsburgh. At that time they had just opened and they were lovely and friendly with delicious wings. We were super psyched to come back, but I don't think we'll make that mistake again.)"}
{"text":"We hiked up [what felt like] a bazillion hills to get here and I can't be upset about it because everything was so good. It was Saturday brunch and we had the mimosas, which seemed heavy on the champagne so no complaints. Everyone loved every item they ordered."}
{"text":"1st time last night and it was a fantastic experience. Dominique was a server and was superior.  The wings are the best ever!  Great atmosphere and good cold beer.  Make sure you stop by!!!"}
{"text":"Brunch with the wife and some friends GREAT food and service 
I would recommend the Bloody Mary very good - top notch even 
we really Like the atmosphere, the new Bar area looks great ! we will definitely be back for dinner and drinks"}
{"text":"Bigham Tavern is a great neighborhood bar.  It's a little divey but not like its predecessor, Kaib's.  It's a great place fo karaoke (but they got rid of it - we hope they bring it back), to watch a game, or to get some wings.  

The wings are probably the highlight of the menu.  Bigham has at least 20 different flavors of chicken wings.  The wings are always very nicely done, and are of decent size.  I've never experienced them overcooked or poorly done.  They're definitely some of the best wings I've ever had in Pittsburgh!

I recently also had a Pittsburgh salad (minus the fries) with grilled chicken - the restaurant offers that you can get any of your toppings (chicken, steak, et al.) tossed in any of their numerous wing sauces.  I ordered the grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce and it was really tasty.  The chicken was nicely done, it was tender and juicy and falling apart.  The rest of salad was comprised of very fresh ingredients.  

The only reason I'm not giving Bigham 4 stars - because the food is pretty good for a divey bar - is because their service is pretty inconsistent.  Some nights it's kind of poor and other nights it's good!  It's a mixed bag.  Basically, it is one of my favorite neighborhood spots and offers people a nice change from Shiloh Grill and Redbeard's."}
{"text":"What a great local bar/restaurant. The menu is phenomenal and the waitstaff is very attentive and fun. This place is a must try for anyone new to the mountain or those who want to have a great night. We love it h"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. They had delicious house made chips. They were super tasty. Crunchy yet soft that made it known it was made from an actual potato. I got the Big Ham, their signature item. It was quite a stack of meat with every pork, ham, salami meat plus bacon. A real \"Dagwood\" sandwich. $2 Bud Light bottles were the special. Old time bar feeling mixed with lots of flat screen TVs everywhere, a perfect place to watch a game. Can't wait to go back and try some wings."}
{"text":"Bingham Tavern is a great spot on the Mount to the watch the game with giant TVs and a good selection of bar food. I highly recommend visiting on a Wednesday for their wing night and half priced wine on Tuesday. They also offer some healthy items on the menu if you're not looking for full on heavy bar food. It's the best food on Mt. Washington off of Grandview. 

As for brunch, they have a new menu that is the best; great drink selection as well. This isn't just a neighborhood bar, it's become a destination in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Made a reservation an hour an advance and we're told we had a 45 minute wait upon arrival. Could not order from the normal menu (which is a shame because it looked great) and could only get a breakfast brunch."}
{"text":"I love that they serve food until 1:00 a.m.   I work in the service industry and that's awesome.  I've been here a couple times and had no issues.  However, last time I went I had absolutely terrible service at the bar.  The bartenders flat out ignored us after the first round of drinks.  They seemed preoccupied in trying to get their closing work done.  The girl bartender with the long black hair never once even looked our way much less asked us if we needed anything.  The guy bartender helped us when we first walked in but then basically ignored us until we flagged him down.  Our glasses were clearly empty and even pushed forward but at no time did he check on us.  Again we had to call him over to get drinks.   It was not that busy to excuse this kind of service.  It's very disappointing as I do like this bar.   I hope management will consider further training for their bartenders in proper customer service."}
{"text":"Tucked into a quaint section of Mount Washington- this is far more than just your neighborhood bar. They have a great draft and bottle selection. Also an awesome menu of seasonal cocktails. I went with a draft of the Leienkeugels cranberry ginger which was delicious. My date ordered a strongbow cider. The menu is huge and overwhelming from burgers, salads to sandwiches and many mac and cheese entrees. I went with the bourbon burger and my date got the buffalo chicken sandwich. My burger was cooked to perfection and topped with cheddar cheese, bbq sauce and an onion ring. For 50 cents more I added fries. My date ordered loaded tator tots which were interesting- tator tot with cheese and sour cream cooked inside. The service was great and would love to go back in the summer to try their outdoor area."}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in Pittsburgh, yet. I had the house tavern wings, they were perfectly done, not too crunchy nor too gooey. Sauce was mild but tasty. Allison was one of the friendliest, and best servers I've had in a while. Lot's of screens to watch the games. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Bruh!

The food here is so good! Being that I love bacon this is a place after my own heart. I had previously studied the pictures and reviews on Yelp and knew exactly what I wanted to order.

After our Yelp event ended we started off with more of the Candied & Jalapeno Bacon. OMG! So freakin' good! A must try!

Next we got a couple of orders of wings. The wings were a nice size, not real big (I don't mind big wings though) and not small. They were extremely juicy and full of flavor. Next time we come I will try to make it on a Wednesday as it is Wingsday and wings are 44 cents all day!

I also had to try one of the mac & cheeses and went with the Shorty Mac (smoked gouda, braised short ribs, peppercorn horseradish and scallions). It was EPIC!

We were asked multiple times by our sever if he could bring us anything or if we needed anything else and even our empty plates from each course were whisked away almost without us even noticing. Service was outstanding the entire evening.

Thank God I don't live near Bigham Tavern as I would be 300 pounds! It is one of my new favorite restaurants and is a must try for anyone who hasn't been!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. In the middle of a neighborhood. Great atmosphere. A little loud but it is a bar. The bar area is set up well. The waitress and staff were so polite and friendly. They did a great job at keeping us up to date on food (kitchen was running slow) and drinks filled. The food was delicious. Loved the periogies!!! The burger was amazing! I had the Rachel and I really enjoyed it. The side salad with shrimp was the perfect size with the mango dressing. This is a must try! We will be back next year!!!"}
{"text":"Good place to go to watch games, get drunk, sing karaokee and of course... eat wings.

Their wings are awesome and well priced on top of it all.
Great drink specials and wing specials.  It's a stereotypical Pittsburgh divey bar."}
{"text":"I heard from several friends that Bigham has the best wings in Pittsburgh. I went here specifically for the wings and they did not disappoint. Although very delicious, another place holds the record in my book. I ordered the honey habanero wings, which sound like they'd be hella spicy, right? Nope, not at all. It's more sweet than anything. The sauce was more of a glaze as opposed to a wet sauce. For those sensitive to spice, you might be able to feel the heat. However, I couldn't taste any traces of habanero, which was ok for me. They still tasted pretty good and not like anything I've had before. To go with my wings, I had homemade chips which were what you'd expect, really. Crunchy, potato-y. Overall, cool bar with good food. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The local watering hole!! Just a few short blocks from our home, wings are so good!! Great burgers and quesadilla's. The owners are super nice!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Bigham a lot, and I have NEVER been disappointed. Their wings are so good, and they keep adding new and awesome things to their menu. It keeps you coming back! Their brunch menu is also pretty decent - not HUGE, but sometimes too many choices is a challenge. They have a large rotating beer selection, so there is always something for everyone. When it's nice out, they have a killer outdoor area too which is a game changer for me. You always want to sit outside when it actually nice in Pittsburgh. The only bad thing about this place is the parking. There is a small lot and street parking so it can be a little rough."}
{"text":"wings are great, nice clean place, nice bar area, good service. only complaint is that the nachos are awful boring bland."}
{"text":"Pierogi swerve delicious. This is the first time I had them boiled then sautéed in butter. This went well with mushrooms and spinach I added. The fries were excellent, freshly cut and dried well. I mixed in some dry Cajun seasoning with my food cuz it had some kick. It was an excellent addition of POW into the meal. 
The ambiance is nice, with booths and dark wooden tables. It was dimly lit even at late lunch; but ok in my book. The service was attentive and easy to speak with about the menu and suggestions."}
{"text":"I have been to Bingham Tavern twice now, and both times had great food, drink, and merriment! The first time I visited BT was before the Guns n Roses concert, which I believe was a Tuesday afternoon. The place was not full by any means, but for a Tuesday at 3:00, definitely a decent bar crowd. My sister and I ordered the loaded fries and added pulled pork. A carnivorous, glutton's dream! We also ordered the Pittsburgh Steak salad, which was also super yummy. This trip however, as a pre game for the concert, was more of a drinking engagement, and our stayed drinks were filled by the friendly bar tender. 

My second visit to BT was about a week ago, just prior to New Years. Just like myself, a lot of people must've had the week off because we were lucky to find a seat at 1:00 pm. Sarah was behind the bar, what a rockstar. Even with literally every seat taken up, she took her time with us and answered our questions about certain menu items. Obviously we could see it was busy, and she did give us the heads' up that the kitchen was crushed and the food might take awhile. ( I very much appreciate this prior to ordering so you can decide if you want to be patient or jet.) We ordered the pulled pork poppers, finally tried the wings, and an order of buffalo mac. Sarah kept us hydrated while we waited for our order, and the mood of the bar was festive and cheerful. Although the food took a little time to come out, everything was hot and fresh when it arrived and delicious! 

The only negative I can say about BT is that the menu has so many delicious options, it is very hard to choose what to get. Next time I am in the burgh, I will be sure to stop back!"}
{"text":"Bigham... Bigham... what do I think about Bigham Tavern.

That is a pretty good question. I really want to like Bigham. Several of my friends live within walking distance of Bigham, and it is certainly a nice step down form the steep prices, perched on Grandview. 

This another one of those places that I wish had a regular crowd featuring a know-it-all mailman and an accountant who is (for all intents and purposes) fused to his bar stool. Sadly, it is overrun with \"Bros\" and \"Dudes\" and girls who look like this wasn't their first choice, but the South Side was at capacity.

The staff is hardworking, but they never seem to be able to keep up. I've often sat for 15, 20, sometimes 25 minutes after saying \"can i get my check\" only to have it come and not be quite accurate. The food is ok, and the prices are a little higher than the food quality would mandate, but they are not astronomical. 

We've gone there for football and hockey games in the past, and though many of the TVs are HD sets, there is often not an HD feed in them. This is annoying to me. 

There is a back room with pool table and electronic darts, but it feels unfinished... like you are in the basement of a McMansion that was supposed to have a rec room, but Dad got caught in an insider trading scandal and had to lay off the workers so now you go down there to escape the heat even though there isn't much to do. 

I don't know... i want to like this place, and i think there is potential but the clientele and the poor service just leaves me very ambivalent about Bigham."}
{"text":"When asked how good the Hangover Helper burger was, Ryder responded \"two thumbs way up. 9/10. A little messy. \""}
{"text":"This place was nothing but great! I literally just flew in from Los Angeles, and I'm glad Bigham Tavern was my first meal in Pittsburgh. I wasn't expecting much, but come to find out that their wings are the best in the state for about 4-5 years now? Correct me if I'm wrong.

So when we first walked in, the sign said seat our selves so... We did just that! Liz was our gorgeous server! Didn't have much questions, but she was informative nonetheless. 

1) Bacon Mac! It was a little too cheesy, but the bacon and pulled pork was AMAZING which made up for it. Just use your fork to pull off the cheese if it's too much.

2) Chicken Tenders basket! The fries are DELICIOUS! The chicken tender was fairly okay. 

3) Their chicken wings were amazing! I tried the spiciest sauce, the garlic parm, and the habanero. My spice tolerance is really high so I wouldn't recommend the spiciest or the habanero if your tolerance is low.

4) BT Burger! Oh my god. I honestly did not read the description of the burger and was overwhelmed when it came it. It consisted of ham, pulled pork, beef patty, and the salami? Don't get me wrong, it was fucking good. I almost didn't finish it. 

Last but not least, the dessert!! A big cookie for only THREE DOLLARS?!? The size of my face? I'll take it!! Add another $1.50 to make it an a la mode! Worth it. The cookie was a little burnt, but I can still taste the greatness of the cookie.

Thank you once again Liz!"}
{"text":"I love a good neighborhood spot and I love the atmosphere at Bighams but I have to say my past few visits the food has been disappointing. The service is always great, no issues with that. Ive gotten the grilled buffalo chicken sandwich twice in the last month and both times the chicken was very dry. I also didn't get a strong buffalo taste it tasted rather plain. Last weekend I got the chips with the sandwich and I think I counted 6 chips on my plate. I didn't feel that was a sufficient side. My friends joked that maybe the rest fell off my plate."}
{"text":"We actually visited this restaurant twice over the 4th of July holiday . We came on Saturday and Tuesday. They had very different menu items so we were super excited. 
On Saturday we ordered, the Jess's Grits and the chicken and waffles. Pretty decent sized portions. I was not a fan of the syrup but it was good. I think you either love it or hate it. The grits were amazing so yummy and super filling. Both meals were amazing ! We ate everything 
On Tuesday, we order the Philly steak sandwich and wings with hot cheese bites. Everything was good and hot and came out very fast. The wing sauce was spicy but sweet. 
I think for us the highlight we're the drinks. If you do brunch , get the mimosa pitcher it's 32 ounces for like 18 bucks. I think I poured 8 or 9 glasses. My bf had the Bloody Mary and he wouldnt drink and eat it fast enough.
The wait staff was friendly and super helpful when it came to questions out the menu. The parking isn't bad and we didn't have to wait at all. We will definitely come back ."}
{"text":"Finally made it here after my coworkers have been telling me to come here for a long time. I got the grilled romaine salad, which was soo good! I never would've thought to grill romaine, but I'll be doing that at home now. It satisfied my craving for grilled food but without being greasy. I topped it off with grilled chicken, and it was one of the best salads I've ever had."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my second visit here. My first was a couple years ago and I would have given the wings a good 4-4.5 stars but this time I wanted something different and went with the bacon and bleu burger and got the loaded tots as my side

My burger was ok only. The burger itself didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting, especially considering it was Cajun seasoned(cooked MR). It wasn't bad but it lacked flavor. I can't say I'd get it again. 

My loaded tots were also just ok. I was expecting a larger order of smaller tots with a bunch of toppings, but instead got four large tots with a little bit of topping and more toppings baked in. Like the burger they weren't bad, but weren't what I was hoping for taste wise.

This sounds negative for four stars but I've been here before and liked what I had and tasted what the rest of my group had and enjoyed that as well. So while I didn't love my own food, I know this place is good and I would return"}
{"text":"We were at the Duquesne Incline and we were looking for a good affordable place to go. Everywhere by the observation deck was pretty pricey so we were lucky to find Bigham Tavern only a 10 minute walk away! Great food at great prices. I had the delicious wings with garlic parm sauce and the fries were amazing!"}
{"text":"Sarah and Lisa were amazing bartenders and Amelia the co-owner did a great job of making sure we felt like regulars on our first visit."}
{"text":"A few neighbors and I go to Bigham Tavern on Tuesdays for their half price bottles of wine.  They have good pub food, and the staff is friendly and very helpful.  I hear that they have good wings, but I have not tried them."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I come with my girlfriend at least twice a month because it is close for both of us and they have a pretty great happy hour and some awesome specials (wing and taco night obviously). The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because of the hostess staff. We normally have a perfectly good server, but for some reason every time I come whoever is at the hostess stand is completely incompetent. I worked in restaurants for 5 years...I understand the difficulty of managing booth and patio requests, seating servers in turn etc. However, this hostess staff really seems to have a hard time with their job: consistently making the guest wait for no reason, having drawn out conversations in front of guests waiting to be sat. Once you get to your table...it's great! Don't let the hostesses incompetence deter you."}
{"text":"This place had the best service my husband and I have experienced in a long time. I'm not sure of the waitresses name but she was awesome. I got the veggie burger and it was delicious and didn't fall apart like a lot of veggie burgers do. The environment was very upbeat, comfortable, friendly and had a Pittsburgh camaraderie Vibe. My husband said that what he ordered was one of the best things he had ever eaten and the waitress brought one of the owners to our table and we all had a shot together. Not sure what it was but it was sweet and tangy,  tasted delicious and wasn't too strong. I highly recommend this place for the great people and delicious food."}
{"text":"When it comes to bar food Bigham Tavern has it alllll figured out! I've been here a handful of times and it has been insanely packed everytime. Last night we used the no wait app and we were seated about 45-50 minutes after putting in our reservation. I would recommend checking this app before you go because chances are there will be a wait. It was a Wednesday night & a Pen's playoff game but it is still impressive how crowded they get on a weeknight. 

The atmosphere is your typical bar, nothing too special about it. They do have specials basically every night which is a bonus. We typically go for wing night, which I think is 40 cents/wing. The only bad thing I can say about Bigham is the service has been kind of slow everytime we've been there. But it's to be expected because of how busy they usually are. 

Bigham's wings are seriously to die for. I have always loved wings and these have got to be some of my favorites! A few stand out flavors include: Gnarley, Honey Garlic Habanero, Hyenna, Hot Garlic, and Memphis Sweet. The wing list is so big, there is a flavor for everyone! If you are looking for some good wings, I would 100% recommend Bigham!"}
{"text":"Decent brunch.  Bartenders were very friendly.  The only downside for me was that it was not close to the downtown area, so it was not as convenient to get to as some other places if you are an out-of-towner."}
{"text":"Bigham Tavern is a pretty typical bar/restaurant. There isn't anything too special about it. There isn't anything especially bad about it either.

The best food I've had while eating there were the loaded fries, and the worst was probably the underwhelming fish tacos with the equally underwhelming sides of beans and rice. The loaded fries were really great and I highly recommend them if you're eating at Bigham.

Bar service has consistently been great, and I've had really good service and then mediocre service. The place isn't grimy, but it definitely is a bar...

Overall, Bigham Tavern is a good place for drinks and bar food. It's similar to a lot of other places and doesn't feel too special, but it could be considered an option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times. It a great atmosphere and the food is amazing. However the service here, at least in the restaurant part, is very poor. The service at the bar is average. I came here with a group and the waitress was not present and got many of our drink orders wrong. Has a lot of potential unfortunately the service brings this place down"}
{"text":"\"Bigham Taven ain't too bad if yinz are lookin' for a bite on that hill above that there dah'tahn area.\"

Pittsburgh.  For whatever reason, this place just screams it (not in a bad way).  In what I personally think is one of the more barren culinary/bar landscapes in the city (Mt. Washington), Bigham provides a welcome escape for $0.44 cent wings, decent drafts and a non-pretentious atmosphere.

Speaking to wing night itself, do yourself a favor and make sure you explore the \"off-menu\" flavors.  Ask your server for a description, but more or less you have the option for three combo sauces (their base Coyote spice rub plus a BBQ, Hot or Butter Garlic) their Cluckin' Hot (hotter than Atomic) or the 5th flavor of the day (I swear it changes every time I ask, so that's what I'm naming it).

The wings themselves are good and it's easy to slide out of here with a dozen wings and two quality drafts for less than $20.  The only place Bigham falls short is the service.  Not exactly the most welcoming crowd to match their welcoming atmosphere and there always seems to be some service hiccups (i.e. table # mix-ups, slow service, taking orders multiple times, etc.).  While these detract from the experience a bit, they've never been enough to offset the otherwise good experience (and my craving for wings)."}
{"text":"Excellent location and friendly staff. Great beer but the food here for me is hit or miss. 

Yummy things I've had: 
- grilled romaine salad: yes, grilled romaine with grilled chicken, balsamic glaze, bacon, blue cheese, etc.
-breakfast blt: not much to explain here, with homefries. 
- my boyfriend gets the mac and cheese here which he says is the BEST 
- wings are great! 

Disappointing things I've had here:
- Guacamole: it kinda tasted like bean dip more than guacamole? 
- Margerita flat bread: I expected one of the long flat bread with fresh mozerrella and tomatoes. This was a thicker pita base and they had sauce and not very ripe half inch thick tomatoes on top smothered in shredded mozerella- I was hoping for something a little more light. 

Overall good place to go and I will go back because it's a convenient location but ask about what you're thinking of ordering because your expectations might be more than what you'll get food wise!"}
{"text":"We love Bigham! My merry crew of friends come in multiple times every week. We could be misconstrued  as rowdy or difficult but the staff at Bigham is always gracious and fun. We have not met a waiter or waitress we don't like and everyone is fast and helpful. We especially want to shout out Steph Z for her amazing service and for putting up with us plus she keeps all of secrets secret. Wing Night Wednesday  is awesome and Saturday  and Sunday brunches make us happy too."}
{"text":"Had the buffalo Mac and cheese and fried pickles were delicious! Great service and friendly waitress. There was also a large selection of good beer!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. It exceeded my expectations. The macaroni was insane. The wings were very good. However. The service was abysmal. I do not drink beer, or pop, and the water tasted like it came from the Mon. 
Want to come to the wings, they have about 20 different options for seasoning/sauces. however, trying to decide which one is best for you will take some time and see if the read lengthy descriptions about each one of them."}
{"text":"I love bigham tavern. This was my favorite place to go when I lived up in mt. Washington.. The food never disappoints and the beers are always great. The service is always really great here and quick. It has ALWAYS been busy here every single time I have came. We usually frequent the bar but I have sat at tables once or twice. There is a pole table or at least there was last time I was here and darts also. I highly recommend their wings which are fantastic.."}
{"text":"I have only been there for breakfast and I can't complain.  There are some hearty choices and some healthy (well, maybe not going to straight to the gym, but...).  Any egg or breakfast item that is served  on a bed of hash browns tickles my fancy.  This past time, i went with the Breakfast BLT, which was stacked high with bacon and a hearty piece of super fresh avocado.  (With a side of Potatoes, of course!)

Bloody Mary's are spicy and tasty with a kabob of meats and cheeses on top.  (if you are super nice, you can ask for another one)."}
{"text":"I went to Brigham Tavern with friends for brunch, I love a good brunch spot that takes reservations. The menu also is very extensive, I actually couldn't think of anything I might have wanted to eat that wasn't present on the menu. Unfortunately, I don't think I made the right selection. The chicken on the chicken and waffles was slightly spicy and also dry, and the waffle was closer to eggo than to belgium, another unexpected disappointment. I did try my friends shrimp and grits which were pretty tasty and the table seemed to enjoy the mimosas. Service was not good, but Sunday brunch seemed an extremely busy period so maybe it's excusable. Ultimately, would only return with someone for whom having lots of options matters and if you think it may be hard to get a space for a group for an afternoon brunch. In general, id continue researching."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere at Bigham. Warm, welcoming staff and a cool layout. I also love the menu. Talk about robust. Tons of choices - especially for brunch - the meal of choice for my group of 7 of Saturday. Our service was nice and quick and the food was also \"nice.\" I split two dishes with a buddy: the Pigless Biscuit and Les' Shrimp & Grits. The former was a biscuit filled with cucumber, marinated red peppers and fig jam. The fig jam was amazing and the cucumber fresh, but the rest was fair. I've had fresher biscuits and the peppers seemed odd, both in texture and taste. Oh well - it was worth a shot. The shrimp and grits were solid, if a bit runny. Maybe a lil' less cheese and it would've been perfect. One friend ordered a fruit cup and was met with 5 thin orange slices more suitable for a tall glass of Blue Moon rather than a $3 fruit \"cup.\" No worries though, since our lovely server took it off of his bill when he expressed concern. All things considered, we had a relaxing Saturday morning brunch in a nice place with great company. I'll definitely return, though I may try a few different menu items."}
{"text":"Good local hang out!

The staff can be hit or miss but the food is always good.

My favorites are the fried pickles and the grilled cheese burger. It's definitely the best burger in the neighborhood.

They have a good beer selection as well with outside seating, as long as it's not too cold."}
{"text":"A great and fun neighborhood bar. Bigham is always a good time and keeps getting better. From all the TVs to the patio and the big room in the back, this is an awesome place with good food and drink. 

The only exception is that the vegetarian options are just not ideal. The black bean burger, which was on the menu for several years (which I think was just a frozen patty I could make at home) has been replaced with a portobello mushroom burger that is over-marinated and not what I want if I'm going out for dinner at a nicer bar. The veggie pita wrap is also subpar. I'd love to see seitan wings, a housemade veggie patty, veggie chili, or something else unique and protein-filled for us veggies on the mount. 

The vast majority of patrons will be happy with the food here - burgers, wings, and big salads are all favorites of my husband, friends and neighbors."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch recently. I was disappointed in this place. I had looked online at the company website to check out their brunch menu before going. When we arrived, the menu was different and several of the food options online were no longer offered. Unfortunately, all of the options (waffles, pancakes and the Monte Cristo) that stood out to me on the online menu were taken off the menu and \"could not be made\". When asked, the waitress checked with the kitchen staff and they said they could no longer make it. She also informed me that the menu was changed a month or so ago but obviously they never updated their website. This was a huge disappointment and the BT offered no more than an \"I'm sorry\".

I was also annoyed with the noise level of this place. I could barely hear my fellow brunch goer and we both spent the morning shouting at each other.

There were some good points: the home fries were delicious; the wait was quoted at 45-60 and in reality only ended up being 15; the Bloody Mary was great."}
{"text":"The only things that went wrong with this visit were that I sent the French onion soup back because it was cold, and we also got the wrong pierogi app, but ate it anyway because it was delicious! 

We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and ordered beer and wings with some apps. I can't remember what kind of wings we got, because all were not easy names to remember, but our waitress was kind enough to explain them all numerous times so we could decide. Mine were a little saucy, but hot, delicious, and came with celery and carrots. My husband tried one with a dry rub and thought they were juicy and decent-sized. The French onion soup I got that was cold, was quickly replaced with a hot one and was a little more sweet than salty. The broth was flavored good and the cheese had a nice melt to it the second time around. The pierogis were both of our favorites, I think. Super crispy but still soft in the middle- they were the perfect combination of textures and flavor. They weren't too crowded, but as we stayed and continued to drink, the crowd seemed to grow. If the weather was nicer, I would have liked to try the outside area, which looked nice. The bathrooms were clean and stocked and easy to find, by the entrance. We found parking on the street without much trouble. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed Bigham Tavern!! I've been living on Mt. Washington for years and started coming here right after it changed over from being Kaib's. What the new owners have done with the place is truly amazing. First, they've done a lot of renovations as well as added an outdoor patio space.

But more impressively, they have totally elevated the menu from typical bar food to something creative and unique! So many great choices, but I love the Rachel wrap, mac and cheese, Pittsburgher, black bean burger, homemade tots, and tickled pickles. But guys, they also do brunch now!! The Big Breakfast is the way to go, and the beer-mosa has been my choice for drinks.

Of course, how can I forget some of the best wings in the Burgh?! Make sure that you try the Coyote if you like dry rub.

We go here probably twice a week and I can't see myself ever stopping for as long as I live in the area. I will happily go here for a night of drinking but I also love to stop by with my family for dinner or brunch."}
{"text":"An unexpected treat, Bigham Tavern is a neighborhood bar in a residential section of Mt Washington.  Great food!  My chili was cooked the way I love it, a really home made taste with lots of serving options (plus a great price).  

Sitting at the bar is dark, there are lots of TV screens and friendly people.  Liz was tending bar, and she provided great service, even though the place was busy on a Monday night.  She even called me \"Sweetie.\"

Good food, nice people, definitely give this place a try.  Lots of people go here to watch sports or just hang out with their friends.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Bigham Tavern is the best bar to have dinner at in the burgh. I used to live a block away and ate there weekly. I moved but still eat there as often as possible
Let's start with appetizers....the loaded tots, pulled pork poppers and nachos are incredible. (I recommend nacho hill instead of regular sized nachos unless you have a group...they are massive)
Next....entrées. The salads are great. I recommend the harvest salad with grilled shrimp. Everything is fresh and it is a good healthy selection.  The burgers are juicy and always come out cooked perfectly. The rodeo and bayou burgers are my favorite.  
The wings are by far the best I have had in Pittsburgh.  So many flavors ...I recommend dingo,  BT original,  or if you want dry rub, coyote. 
I have never had a bad food experience here. The beer selection and cocktails are wonderful ad well.
The best part....the staff and owners. 
I highly recommend stopping in. The only downside is parking during peak times,  but it's worth a little walk."}
{"text":"I ordered food to go from them and the server gave themselves an extra $5 tip on my card. I don't plan on going back to get ripped off again."}
{"text":"Super nice staff-great beer selection.  Lucky folks to have this fine establishment in their hood.  Our waitress Brandy was wonderful    Great hire!!"}
{"text":"I have to preface this review by saying this very important thing: I'm not really a Wings Girl. Just not my jam. 
I've been to Bigham Tavern a few times through the years, mostly as a result of living in the neighborhood and friends wanting a place to kick back. Half the times I've gone, the service has been just fine. The other half, the waitress has been either rude or has mixed up our order. On my most recent visit, the waitress was quite nice, albeit a little stressed out. 
I've gone for quesadillas, I've gone for wraps, I've gone for tacos, and yes... I've gone for wings. The food is alright, certainly decent, but nothing I'd write home about. Even the wings.
The beer list is also decent, but not nearly the best. 
Maybe my experiences have just been a bad set of circumstances, but after giving it many chances, Bigham isn't my jam."}
{"text":"I love the hyena wings!!! Wednesday is wing night and definitely a must! I also love to get the hot cheese balls. Parking is always tough to find but worth it for the food! The prices can be expensive for other food and drink but I pay it because it's all good. The servers and bartenders have always been friendly to my friends and I."}
{"text":"As a resident of the South Side in close proximity to Mt. Washington, I was very pleased and a little surprised when I discovered this little neighborhood gem tucked away on a side street. Three of us made the short trip for brunch and all enjoyed the fare that Bigham had to offer. I am normally a regular patron of the sweeter breakfast offerings, but I flipped the script and decided on a savory hash skillet with eggs, potatoes and sausage. Delicious! My husband and friend both had the pulled pork hash and both gave rave reviews. I was very impressed with the menu and the clean, cozy atmosphere. I plan to return for French toast and then another time for dinner. Their main focus is bacon and it is featured in many of their dishes. Consider me a fan!"}
{"text":"Our server Dominique was lovely. We sat in the corner for a WHILE but she was attentive and the food was bomb. They were out of a few things foodwise, but as a fellow server I understand how viciously childlike people can be when they don't get their version of a perfect experience. First time here even though I've worked on the mount for years. Will def return. Good times for sure."}
{"text":"The wings and wing night rank in my top 3 in any order depending on the day!

A great place, recently updated in the last few years, they have a great patio and large inside bar with a great selection of craft beers.

The black and gold and honey garlic habanero and the coyote dry rub are some of the great wing flavors! They have a ton!"}
{"text":"I have been to Bigham twice in the past month- once for some drinks and an appetizer and another time for wing night. It is nothing fancy instead- there are some booths for dining, a nice patio, a big bar and a nice back room with darts. They have a decent beer selection, but I went for a pineapple & vodka instead. We ordered their tater tots with bacon, cheese and scallions as an appetizer. I was surprised when they came out- a small portion, but the quality was awesome. They were homemade- shredded potatoes mixed with the bacon, cheese and scallions and then fried. They were good- but pricey for the small portion we received.

Wing night was CROWDED. I highly recommend using the \"No Wait\" app and checking into the restaurant before you arrive, to cut down on your wait time. Luckily, we found some spots at the bar- so we didn't have to wait too long. I ordered some of the buffalo wings, as well as some type of sweet & spicy thai sauce. The wings were very good- the thai ones being my favorite. The buffalo were just like any other buffalo and I found the sauce to be too buttery- it didn't stick to the wings in the way I enjoy.

Overall, I like this place a lot. Really tasty and unique bar food."}
{"text":"Wednesday is Wing Nite! 35 cent wings and THE best wings in Pittsuburgh.... voted that way.  Of course that can be subjective depending on your likes. Kaib's uses their own sauce that not TOO hot but is very flavorful and they serve \"half wings\" (leg & wing parts separated) The wings are also well cooked... crunchy but not dry or undercooked like some places.  

The burgers are HUGE, the Fry's are the kind of Fry's served in the 70's & 80's ... not mushy but a little crunchy so the kids love em.  Be sure and pay attention the \"home of the Pittsburgh Pirates Inc.\" sign when you walk in... it's quite a story.

This is the kind of place people search out when you visit a city. It's got a real Pittsburgh ambiance... It's a the kind of place \"locals\" hang out at the and kind of hearty food that hearkens back to a Steelworker kinda place.

It's a great place to check out if you're heading up to any of the more expensive places along Grandview avenue for a bit of local flair and less expensive drinks"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of taking my parents here.  It would have been fine for us to grab a drink after work but not good for parents.  The outside has been renovated but the inside has not.  It's a typical bar with tables where you can still hear the music playing.  They had some cool al a carte options such as a mac and cheese that you can put whatever you want in but the it was really just ok."}
{"text":"5-star bar food. The amazing burger (the Big T burger) was shared and more than enough. Great home made chips and wings were great too. Definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"Food was cold. 2 of us sent back cold Mac and cheese, and another person in our group found a hair in her Mac and cheese AND in her salad. Our server was great though!"}
{"text":"The is my favorite bar to eat at on Mt Washington. The menu has plenty to choose from, the food is always good and the service is always as expected. Some nights it's very busy for obvious reasons so I like to come for lunch. The mac and cheese is great, always a go-to order for me. They always have a nice beer selection too, a nice variety so my father and I both can order what we like."}
{"text":"Testing out my new Yelp review format on this one! I was in town for business and was able to meet up with some friends here and they told me they had the best wings in town.. so we shall see.

Appearance: Situated on a sloping road perched on Mt. Washington the parking situation is grim. You can MAYBE catch a spot in the open lot directly across from the bar or snag a spot on the street. Good luck. Lol. The name \"Bigham Tavern\" led me to believe that I'd be walking into some rundown, dive bar. Nope. I was wrong and I'm glad I was. Nice, modern feel, basic and simple styling. There isn't too much flare on the walls or many decorations at all, just TVs so that you can keep up with whatever sports you're into!

Atmosphere: The place very lively both times that I came. The waitresses are all friendly (flirty) and make you feel welcomed. Some of the tables were a lil' sticky and not perfectly clean, but I guess it's almost expected in a wing joint. Lol.

Service: Service was on point! Hailey took care of maybe 12 of us at once that Monday and she was excellent. She didn't miss a beat. Smiling, making sure we had everything we needed and making good suggestions. I can't remember my 2nd waitress's name, but she was just as awesome when I came solo on Wednesday. It's safe to say that service is a priority here and that they take pride in treating their customers well.

Food: I was able to try 8 different flavors of wings over the course of my 2 visits here.
- Hyena: A buffalo sauce with a dash of garlic topped with parmesan cheese. One of my favorite sauces here. The cheese really put this flavor over the top. I really enjoy when places combine seasonings with sauces.
- Bourbon: Kentucky bourbon (with the alcohol boiled off of course) combined with soy sauce, brown sugar and other seasonings. This sauce was really good and tasted different from anything I've had before. This was in the \"hotter\" section of the menu, but the heat wasn't unbearable.
- Tequila Lime: This sauce didn't impress me so much. It said it was supposed to be \"hot\", but I certainly didn't taste much of it. I'd pass on this one my next go-round.
- That Spicy Peanut: One of my other favorite sauces. A good spice, tasted just like some pad thai from a Thai restaurant, but it could use even more of a peanut taste to make it better!
-  Chupacabra: Interesting name, same with the sauce. This one wasn't very spicy, but I loved it. Sweet and smokey, but a bold flavor that I absolutely loved. I would've passed up on it had Hailey not recommended it. Thank you!
- Coyote: This a dry rub \"sauce\" that I'm totally a fan of. The trick is to dip it in bleu cheese then use that bleu cheese to pick up more loose seasoning from the bottom of the container! So it's layers of flavor. Lol.
- Chipotle: On the hotter side, it was quite delicious. Very peppery and while I thought it would've been a dry rub (confusing the name with \"Cajun\"), it's a nice, red sauce, letting you know to beware! You don't have to though, it's not THAT hot.
- Atomic: Last but not least. Don't let the name fool you. I expected to be gasping for air, chugging milk and running outside to jump in the snow because of how hot it was. I barely blinked. It's a habanero based sauce, but it was not that bad, very good though, I would totally get it again.

Value: Absolutely good value here. The food was good and well worth the money, especially if you come on Wednesdays which is their #WingWednesday night! $0.50 wings, but you can't take any home with you, so they say... Beers are decently priced and there's no sticker shock looking at anything on the menu.

In conclusion I really enjoyed this place. It's definitely somewhere I'm going to frequent when I'm in Pittsburgh. I can't miss a Wing Wednesday! While you're up here make sure you go to the top of Merrimac Street and check out the incredible view of downtown Pittsburgh. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"Bad experience. I've heard great thing about Bigham tavern but this experience was very bad. Our appetizer was cold like it had been sitting out. Then we had it taken back and it seemed as if they put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and gave it back. Didn't eat it the 2nd time. Our wings very Luke warm and not very good either. 6 different food runners came to our table and asked if the food they had was ours so very disorganized. Waitress was very nice as well as the manager and they did comp our appetizer. However, very displeased with the whole experience. The only thing that was good was the beer and pierogies, maybe because it was NFL Sunday they were busy so didn't give us a quality product. I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I don't know if the cooks are high or what. Ordered take out and when I got home the Caesar salad had no dressing. None. And the hummus appetizer had no hummus. Just cut up vegetables. The receipt was stapled to the bag with the items ordered so I have no clue how this happens. Every time I eat there the kitchen messes something up."}
{"text":"I can't believe I just sent here for the first time last night! We stopped in before the Steelers game and were greeted by a lively bunch of patrons. :) 

We split the side of fries and I kind of regret that we split them, THEY WERE SO GOOD! The perfect balance of season and crispiness. I will definitley get them again. 

I of course had to try their wings, and I'm so glad I did! I had their BT original sauce, which to me was the perfect buffalo sauce. It had a creaminess that really balanced out the flavors. My second sauce was their chihuahua, which was so good. It was a mix of a dry rub and sauce. If you love garlic I highly recommend these!! The wings were a good size and crispiness as well. 

Our waitress was on the ball with getting us our food and check quickly so we could make it to the game. 

I know I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I visited Bigham Tavern for the summer session of Restaurant Week - the promise of bacon chipotle ice cream drew me in. Since it was a Monday, I was seated quickly and the server was prompt in handing over menus and taking my drink order (and she seemed to check on me nearly every 3 minutes, which seemed excessive, but better than the alternative). I went with the restaurant week menu - pork belly and white bean soup, a salad with poached pears and goat cheese, an appetizer with pulled pork three ways, a smoked pork loin entree with julienned vegetables and a potato fritter, and the infamous bacon chipotle ice cream. 
The soup was good, but nothing special - it tasted almost exactly like the ham and bean soup my grandma used to make, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The salad wasn't what I was expecting since the menu description mentioned pancetta and I didn't notice any meat. Also, the salad contained just the teensiest bit of balsamic reduction - it could have used a bit more.
The tri-pork crisp appetizer was my favorite part of the meal; it was pulled pork three ways - Mexican, American, and Asian. However, I bit into a huge glob of straight wasabi on the Asian one - wasn't expecting that. Otherwise, this app was pretty great.
The smoked pork loin tasted delightfully smoky, and the potato fritter was delicious as well. My julienned vegetables weren't exactly cooked, though - the zucchini was, but the carrots were as firm as if they were raw. The flavors were good, but there was just something really off about those carrots.
As for the ice cream, honestly, I was disappointed. By the time it got to me, it was halfway melted, so it was more like a cold soup with a dollop of ice cream floating in it. I could hardly taste the bacon, nor the chocolate, because the chipotle overpowered *everything*. This was like chipotle ice cream with cocoa powder and some bacon bits - not what I was expecting, and not necessarily something I want to eat again.
In summary, it was a good meal for the price - 4 courses for $20.15 is a crazy good deal - but there were too many inconsistencies for me to give it more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar with a nice selection of food. I always get the black and gold wings and they are fantastic. It's like a tangy/spicy buffalo honey mustard sauce. Amazing combination. 

It is also an especially good bar for watching sports games. They have 2 projection screens and lots of TVs in each area. Bigham is also very easy to work with for private events. The back room and patio are great spaces for smaller events."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't already reviewed Bigham Tavern. My husband and I live nearby and we go here all of the time. Whenever we have friends or family in town, this is our go-to place to bring them to show them what awesome food Mount Washington has to offer. There are a few major categories of deliciousness on BT's menu: wings, mac and cheese, burgers, and drinks. (This is not all they have on the menu, but these are the things we usually order.) BT is known for its wings, and for good reason because they're amazing. They have quite a long list of wing options. My favorites are the hot garlic and the gnarley (mix of buffalo sauce, bbq sauce, and garlic, I think). I am not usually a big fan of chicken wings but these are s.o. g.o.o.d. They are always hot, crispy and just salty and garlicky enough for perfection. They come with ranch or blue cheese. You can get a basket of carrots and celery with 'em for $1.  
Continuing along, the mac and cheese is another winner. The menu offers several options, all of which are served in a skillet with a soft pretzel stick on the side. I used to adore the Greek Mac but they took it off the menu, which I'm a little salty about but the Buff Chick Mac is almost as good. I also love the burgers, especially the rodeo burger. They will do any burger with a veggie patty. The burgers are gigantic and will easily make for two meals. Other menu standouts for me are the hot cheese bites appetizer and the grilled romaine salad (try it - they put romaine on the grill and make a salad - it's weird, smoky, crunchy, and awesome.) 
This is a tavern, so the beverages are an important. They always have a strong draft list with a good variety of different beers and ciders bottled and on tap. They also have a surprisingly good cocktail list that is updated seasonally, and wine. Check out their happy hour every weekday from 5-7pm. They also have half off bottles of wine on Tuesdays and Wednesday is wing night - 44cent wings. The only reason I leave off one star is because the service can be inconsistent. I have many times had excellent servers, but a few times we've had less than great experiences. Overall though, Bigham is a winner - definitely check it out when you're on the Mt. Wash."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Great spot to watch the game! This place has an awesome atmosphere! They have so many selection on beer! The prices are terrible! I would for sure recommend this spot for lunch, happy hour or just a great pre game spot!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here Saturday afternoon to have an early dinner and get some drinks before a concert downtown. We wanted to go somewhere a little outside of downtown so it was easy to find street parking and it was not very busy.

I had previewed the menu ahead of time to be sure they had plenty of vegetarian options (they do!) and a decent beer selection. Being that I'm not from Pittsburgh, I was hoping to sample some local beers while there, but I was a bit disappointed to find that they had only two local Pitt brews on tap. (the website was not updated with current draft selections, which isn't too cool).

Based on the menu, the reviews, I guess I had higher expectations than I should've for this place. Hence the \"A-Ok\" review. It is what it is. A neighborhood burger and beer bar, but nothing more.

Our waitress not very attentive and our food was okay. My wife really liked her fish tacos. My veggie black bean tasted great, but instead of a bun, it came with bread with tough crust, almost too tough to bite through. I knew when I ordered that I was getting housemade chips with my burger, but I was a bit disappointed and wishing I had upgraded to french fries (although I'm not a big fan of chips with my burger, you might enjoy them more than I did).

We were going to try their dessert, but after waiting so long on beer cheese for my wife (she asked before the meal and received it after our meal AND was charged for it), we decided to just ask for the check and take off. We went somewhere else for a few more drinks.

I can't see going out of my way to go back there and since it's not on my way to anywhere I go, I guess I won't return. But the experience wasn't terrible. I was just surprised at how inattentive our waitress was when it was not busy there. It's too bad most of my experience/review was rooted in the service, but that's a big part of the experience for me. Otherwise, I can cook veggie burgers on my grill."}
{"text":"Three of my friends and I took advantage of the \"Restaurant Week Menu\" for the last day of the specials. We very impressed with the food. We had a four course meal that included a grilled wedge salad and soup. There french onion soup was on point. The main course was amazing. And the dessert was vanilla ice cream with candied bacon. This was a surprisingly good combination. 

The atmosphere was nice and service was very good. The establishment was packed for a Sunday night.  All and all I will return."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch this weekend as I've heard a lot about their food and mainly, the wings. We had a big party (post wedding) so we all got different things and split it. Everything we got was incredible...except for the wings. The wing itself was not very good, and there was virtually no sauce on them. So much so that 2 of us had to ask for a side of sauce. My favorite thing we had was the Pittsburgh Flatbread which is pierogis, pot roast, and cheese on a flatbread and also the Rogi Bowl with chili was awesome. Great beer selection and our server was fantastic with our large party. They have handheld ipads that you just sign and pay when you're ready to go which was SO CLUTCH and easy. The hype kind of ruined the wings for me, but otherwise a real nice experience."}
{"text":"I used to think that Quaker Steak and Lube had the best wing night in Pittsburgh, but Bigham Tavern has proven me wrong. We tried habanero wings, dry rub, wet rub, etc etc, each as good as the last. It was packed, so make a reservation on Open Table. Has a typical bar feel to it, but that's what we were going for. Service was fast, and beers flowed quickly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I finally tried the Bigham Tavern. I only live down the street but for the longest time didn't even realize they were there. I was really impressed. At first I was a little leery because I figured it would be just typical average not so good bar food but it wasn't. It was actually really good. I ordered the Mac n cheese with fried onions & the Greek quesadilla and my husband got the fish sandwich. My favorite was the Mac n cheese & the fried onions was a perfect addition. 
Service was great! 
Definitely will go back! They are also open late so it's a perfect place to go if you need a late night dinner & everything else is closed."}
{"text":"BT has the best atmosphere, food, and service on Mount Washington.  Fun for dinner with family or a gathering of friends at the bar!  Wings are good, nachos are even better!"}
{"text":"My first visit to the Bigham Tavern was an event for Elite Yelpers. When I walked in, my first impression was a standard sports bar. And I don't particularly fancy them. I didn't order off the menu since this was a catered event, but I can say that I was really impressed with the presentation and set up. They created an experience that made me want to come back again. The managers and waitstaff were very attentive and consummate hosts--always checking to see that our water glasses were filled and if we needed anything. I typically don't make it to Mt Washington often and the restaurant is so tucked away in a residential neighborhood that I doubt it would've fallen on my radar. Thanks Yelp for making the introductions, and BT for a great event and great food!"}
{"text":"Here rn. Been trying to pay for like 19 minutes now but our waitress is literally dumb or something. Forgot an entire order of my wings, pens game was not on for the playoffs and we were not offered a discount to make up for it. Tasty wings and a lot of voluptuous booties abound but everyone working here seems so frantic that it's making me almost afraid to ask for like..Anything. Lol. Laughing out loud but srsly just trying to pay and gtfo. :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Bigham Tavern twice before, but never documented it. 

It's set off a side street on Mt. Washington- so it feels like your walking into your neighbors house. Or a neighborhood bar. We went before a Stanley Cup playoff game - so we arrived 6:15pm and there was plenty of seating available. 

Since it's finally getting warm outside, we decided to sit on the patio. They had plenty of tables and a big screen for the Pens game. 

We ordered Blue Moons  to start - then we took advantage of the Happetizers (from 5-7 $5 apps) We ordered the Loaded Tots - I was so disappointed- there was literally 9 tots in an order. They tasted good though - they tasted like potato pancakes. 

We also ordered the pretzels (follow twistburgh) for more pretzel reviews! They were okay - just your basic pretzel stick.. so I would try another appetizer next time. 

For my entree, I ordered the Loaded Mac & Cheese. It's loaded with chicken and bacon - it was okay. Again, I think I would order something else next time. All of the macs come with a pretzel stick as a side. It wasn't the best Mac I've ever had. 

Overall, this is good spot in the neighborhood- be warned there were some loud fans, but that's Pens fans for ya!"}
{"text":"Great food. This is saint Patrick's day.. Plenty of staff to handle our needs. Free poured drinks.. Order the chicken wings you won't be unimpressed. Great tavern, will return again."}
{"text":"Bigham Tavern is the perfect neighborhood bar in Mt. Washington. I have yet to have something on this menu that I haven't loved. My go to is obviously the wings (Wednesday night 44 c wings!). Their sandwiches are absolutely delicious as well! If you're looking to just come and hang at the bar, that's always fun too. The bar has a lot of TVs for all of the games, and usually have music bumpin! Highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for some drinks and dinner! We sat at the bar (which was packed and very popular). I started off with some beers while I waited for my order of buffalo chicken Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was to die for! It'll hard for me to order anything else there because I'll be thinking about that wonderful Mac and cheese for a while! Great taste and great display :)"}
{"text":"My mom and I really love Mac n Cheese and I have heard a lot of great things about Bigham Tavern so we decided to give it a try. 

For starters, let's talk about their menu! They have so many menu items and the build your own options are a huge plus in my book. Who doesn't want to build their own Burger, Mac, Sammich, Salad and 'Rogies. To top it off the amount of topping options they give you to build your dinner masterpiece is just incredible. If I am ever struggling to pick my meal it's nice to have the option to build your own. But I didn't struggle with deciding this day, I instantly knew when I seen the smokehouse Mac on the menu I had to try it. I love smoked Gouda, pulled pork and sweet Memphis bbq sauce so it was a no brainer. This Mac was hands down probably one of the best Mac n Cheeses I have ever had. It came with a pub pretzel which was a nice bonus! 

My mom built her own with bacon, provolone, smoked Gouda and white cheddar. She loved it! I do have to say that it is not a super creamy Mac and I prefer that over the extra creamy stuff. 

I loved the pub style atmosphere and the larger booths that make entertaining groups much more comfortable. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and salads, especially if you're a fan of pork. The customizable Mac and cheese is a fun item. The service was good. It's apparent that the building is undergoing some renovations and repairs which detracts from the atmosphere. Plus the men's room was poorly lit and the toilet did not flush."}
{"text":"I've given this place so many chances. Over the last year and a half, I've hit my tolerance level with the service and food quality. The wings are pretty average and they should stop resting on the fact that they ever won an award for them. 

I feel like BT is lacking the professionalism and focus it takes to run a joint of this size and with such a large menu. Whatever is going on in the kitchen is killing this place. No one is bothering to monitor the food they give to customers. When they do deliver food, it's usually not hot or even warm, but tasty enough for a Sunday brunch.

I've eaten here maybe 8 or so times. Hit or miss experiences...

1. They burned the hell out of my burger twice on the same order when I asked for medium-rare. The first attempt was BLACKENED, the retry was completely gray, well-done and dry. I rarely send back food, but learn how to cook a damn burger - it's easy.
2. I came in one night and was virtually ignored while trying to get the staff's attention so I could ask about getting some food.
3. Brunch this morning involved A LOT of long, blonde hairs wrapped around my bacon and fresh toast. The guy at the bar serving us was very apologetic and comped  everything but we were really grossed out.

I wonder how much food this place throws away after not charging customers... 

Three strikes. Adios :("}
{"text":"I recently moved to Mt. Washington and Bigham Tavern was one of the first places I tried. I was a little skeptical, especially since I'm a vegetarian, but I was pleasantly surprised! It's definitely a \"hole in the wall\" type of place - it is so dark inside and you can tell it's mostly locals. Their prices are great and their food was amazing! We ordered the hot cheese bites and got them tossed in wing sauce. Especially for the prices, the portions are great! Good beer selection, and lots of veggie options! I got the rodeo burger but with a veggie patty. My fiance and I were both so pleased. They have lots of great specials... We will definitely be regulars!"}
{"text":"Great find! The food was amazing and the service was good, too. If you like bacon, you MUST try it. They put bacon on almost everything. I'd never heard of bacon on cheesecake or wings before, but they did it and it was all yummy!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Has the local neighborhood bar atmosphere while appealing to a broader audience. Food, especially wings, is always a step or two above what you would expect. Very reasonable beer prices. Definitely going to try and catch a Steeler game here sometime soon."}
{"text":"So we were really excited to eat here! However, it took us 15 minutes to get acknowledged. It was very very loud to where you can't hear people at your own table. The noise kind of comes with the place so we couldn't really complain. The waitress forgot what drink I ordered and had to ask me 4 separate times after I placed it.. Regular unsweet tea!!! Then! When she brought it, I asked for a straw. She ran off and then literally threw a straw in my glass!! I didn't even drink my drink. We had to keep getting her attention and she forgot my boyfriends water that was the first thing he ordered. The food was pretty good. However when he ordered his wings she said do you want veggies and ranch. He said yes and it was charged an extra $2 for it! Never made us aware. After she brought us the check, she asked if we wanted dessert!! It was just a terrible meal, service wise. We will not return. Owners need to focus on customer service as much as getting young waiters in there so they can actually receive good service."}
{"text":"Maybe avoid this place in a Sunday. They have a limited menu and run out of a lot of items. 

The service was extremely slow and the food they had (out of about 5-6items) wasn't anything to write home about. 

The atmosphere is loud and hot. I don't see it as a place I'd take kids to. 

Bottom Line is: Pass it on a weekend, maybe try a weekday when they'll have the full menu."}
{"text":"Bigham's is located in a residential area and next to a church but that doesn't stop it from rockin on a Friday night.  

Husband had 12 wings split between 2 flavors: tequila lime and regular buffalo wings. He said they were excellent and very moist. Just not as hot as he likes. We also had onion rings as an app and they were good. I had the cheese steak and it was huge and delicious. The meat very tender. We  could've easily shared this sandwich. I had to forego almost all of my bun in order to be able to the meat. 

Out server Dominic was awesome. Friendly and attentive but not too much. 

Great place. I bet it really rocks on a game night."}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened to the food at this place lately.  Maybe they have a new cook, but the quality has dropped significantly.  This is very disappointing as this was my favorite bar food spot.

To start, they used to have some of the best tater tots I had ever had.  They were huge and obviously handmade.  Now they have generic, tiny, and obviously frozen tots they use.

The last two times I have eaten here I had a burger and ordered it medium rare.  It has come out almost well done both times.  If you don't know how to cook a burger, don't have it on your menu.

Another favorite of mine used to be the buffalo chicken sandwich.  It was a huge piece of fried chicken covered in their delicious original sauce.  It used to be bigger than the bun.  Now it is a skimpy tender with barely any sauce on it.

Whether it is a change of cook or simply a lack of effort, loyal customers are going to stop coming back if they don't get it together."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Bighams. It's our \"Go to\" bar for years now, but last night was a terrible experience. We shouldn't have to be jammed packed at the bar looking at tons of empty tables. I asked why it was like that and was told it was to help out the kitchen. I understand they don't want to get backed up, but at least let people sit and wait for hours. Some of our party left because they couldn't enjoy themselves. Thankfully I asked a gentleman who was sitting alone if we could join him and he couldn't have been more welcoming. If it wasn't for him, I'm not even sure when we would've gotten seated. 

On a positive note, our server was super sweet and on top of things, which was much appreciated. 

Unfortunately, I can't say I'll be back anytime soon if this is the new system of seating tables."}
{"text":"Cool sports bar w/ bangin wings a ton of house made sauces and rubs. The margherita pizza was very good and so was the Mac & cheese."}
{"text":"We had been to Bigham for the elite event which sampled their brunch. Last night was our first dining experience. It was late night (like 11, lol) and i remembered that bigham had a Wednesday wing night. I called to see how long it lasted and the host told me til 1am! how awesome. 

We ended up going with our friend and having a nice time. First, we ordered chips and salsa. The salsa had to have been homemade. It was extremely fresh and delicious! The chips had a great lime taste to them and were also fresh.

Wings are 44 cents on Wednesday. You order them by 6 per flavor. I went with tequila lime and gnarley. I also ordered a side of fries. My friends also ordered wings (general tso) and one also ordered a cheesesteak.

The wings were great! Gnarley was an awesome flavor and was described in the menu as hot, garlic and sweet bbq. Tequila lime had the obvious plus a dash of hot sauce. The fries were fresh cut seasoned perfectly. Ranch was $1 but was great and it was a generous amount.

The only hiccup was that my friend asked for no cheese on cheesesteak (weird, huh) & it had cheese. They remade it and service was beyond friendly. 

 Other than that we completely enjoyed everything. I love late night food joints so no doubt we'll be back. That salsa is calling my name! They had an awesome menu. Check it out"}
{"text":"Wings were very good with an amazing selection and at 44 cents you can't go wrong! Bartenders were
Pleasant and had a heavy pour which I like.."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of this place on the weekends; too loud, too crowded, too much of a South Side vibe. However, on a quieter weekday, it can't be beat. Outstanding food, great beer list, friendly patrons and staff."}
{"text":"I really loved this place the first time I went. The food was outstanding, the service was good, and the atmosphere was great.

HOWEVER...

Last time I went, the menu had changed substantially, the server we got was more interested in every other table around us, and the food itself was... alright.

Between the parking situation here, and the other disappointments listed above, I'm not going to go out of my way to come here again. Really gonna miss that seafood mac they got rid of."}
{"text":"If you're not American or White you won't get served well here.. If you think I'm talking non sense. Why won't you try it for yourself ? So there's 3 in our seat and we were the first one that got served and then for some reason the other tables that just sat down got their orders first, out of curiosity I asked them if they ordered in advance they said no, and they were even nice to tell me \"I was wondering  why our food came in first but you got seated and your ordered before us\" tsk tsk... We asked for follow and get this, they didn't really get our order... They didn't even apologize but instead gave us an attitude.."}
{"text":"Pretty convinced that they have some of the best, if not the best, wings in Pittsburgh. They come in 6, 12, or 24 increments, along with up to 2 sauces. While I haven't tried many yet, my favorite so far is the Coyote (probably because of a bias toward dry rubs). The wings also come with a nice side of crunchy celery and carrot sticks. Honey garlic habanero is also highly recommended. All in all, it's pretty great for this little bar to serve this quiet neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here without a reservation my first week back in Pittsburgh to play trivia with friends. We had such a fantastic time! At first, it didn't look like we are going to be able to be seated since we had a large party and didn't make a reservation on trivia night. The girls at the hostess stand are amazing and were able to accommodate us without a reservation. I'm glad to know that they take reservations now too! Also, you're able to put yourself in line on the Yelp app, but our group was too big for that this time.

The trivia was fun but it was a bit hard to hear at certain tables in the restaurant. The food made up of the sound quality though! We had wings and really enjoyed them! We had the Black&Gold, and Honey Garlic Habanero. Everyone in our party claimed that these were two of the top wing sauces. Give them a shot! 

This gem made me wish I lived up on Mt. Washington so that I could enjoy this place more often! I'll certainly be back with a reservation, and hopefully a better outcome with the trivia."}
{"text":"Came here thinking they would be the best wings in the US, and they were pretty good! If you want the best wings, though, go to FatHeads instead."}
{"text":"I want to give this place five stars, and I would if some items were cleaned up.  I'll get to that later.  Regardless, I really liked this place during my Friday lunch visit.

I liked the menu.  It was similar to a more hipster place on Shiloh, with a nice selection of burgers, wings, and other \"better\" munchies.  They also had Lenten specials.  Lots of different draft beers and tons of bottles from what I could see.  The bartender wasn't overly friendly (Problem #1... he seemed not too happy to be at work which is a definite turn off.)  

I ordered a crab sake sandwich, given it was Friday in Lent and it was a staple on their menu I wanted to see what they were workin' with.  I think the crab cake is the \"end all be all\" of a restaurant--if it is fresh you know the food is good.  If it is a dense puck of breading then you know what the restaurant is like.  It was phenomial.  I got the sweet potato fries which were just so-so (it's hard to find good SP fries, IMO).  The bread that it was served on was SO FRESH that I had a hard time not picking at my pieces.  The portions were reasonable and you could tell the main dish was the star of the show because they side portions were perfect.  

Sitting at the bar was the classic Mt Washington crowd-- the obnoxious frat guys, the mt washington natives, young professionals.  I really liked this atmosphere but Problem #2 is that the obnoxious frat guys kind of turned the environment .  I mean, there is no need to state loudly (for all the bar to hear, at noon-or any time of the day) \"Worthless Yinzers\" during a conversation with your buddy.  I mean, you really aren't impressing anyone.  

The draft beers are expensive to my no-longer-a-city-dweller perspective, with two beers and a sandwich costing a little over $20, but I would go back again for the food.  It was awesome."}
{"text":"Lot of food and beer choices, Sunday brunch is spot on  also all the mac n cheese options are great! This place does have a college bar type feel after 10pm witch can be annoying at times."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I wonder: where did they find these people? Impeccable service, so warm and friendly, as if you stopped by your family's house!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is by far the best place we have been to while visiting Pittsburgh.  Our waitress Steph Z. was amazing! We explained we were from out of town and she went above and beyond to recommend menu items, bring us sample wing sauces, even had the bar make us custom shots we were used to from back home. We could have stayed all night in the laid back sports type atmosphere.  We ordered wings and they were delicious and huge!  Too bad Bigham Tavern isn't back home in Texas because we would be regulars!"}
{"text":"Good wings, pretzels and burgers. Waitress was super friendly and nice. Thought the price was reasonable. Nice tavern if your in the area."}
{"text":"The Mrs. and I went to Bigham Tavern tonight for dinner.  Our server was Brandi.  Off to a good start, menu looked good - some great options.  We put in an order of Pulled Pork Poppers as an appetizer.  We followed up with the #1 BT Burger and Bayou Burger.  So far so good.  

After about 20-25 minutes and no sign of our waitress, someone from the kitchen brought out our burgers.  No appetizer.  Eventually we see our waitress 5 minutes later, we ask about the appetizer.  She says \"oh, that's my fault\".  She offers to comp the appetizer and have us take it to go.  She comes back later, says they will not comp the appetizer, and says \"hey, at least your food is good, right?\".  (That's fine if you won't comp the appetizer and just don't charge us for it, but please don't tell us you're going to do something and then not follow through (again), it's setting the wrong expectation with your customers.)  

We finish up, ask for 2 to-go boxes.  She brings us one.  We finally get our check and leave our cash in the check holder booklet, only waiting 20 minutes again with no sign of her to take our payment (while other waitresses have walked by and cashed out several other customers).  When we get our change back, there's no actual change (which there should have been), only bills.  I likely would have left the change as part of the tip, but at least give me the option and don't outright take it.  I get the impression that once she realized she has made a mistake that she just flat out quit.  Her personality was fine when she was around - but this just spiraled from one mistake into a Murphy's Law of complete service failure.  No idea when or if we will return again."}
{"text":"This is it. My new, way too good junk-but-high-quality-junk-food-place. The menu sticks to the basics--wings, mac and cheese, sandwiches, burgers--but executes them in really elevated ways. 

Met a friend here to grab wings and beer. I'm not a wing person, really (not a fan of eating the skin,) but these I could eat a ton of. They're so good! Crispy on the outside, but not at all dry on the inside. Lots of flavors, many of which are doable for the spicy averse like me. There's one on the appetizer menu that is just heaven- grilled maple, bacon, bourbon wings with sea salt, cracked pepper, and scallions. (Icky Sticky Wings) YUM.

If that's not awesome enough, they also have an appetizer of candied bacon! 3 strips for the piglet, 6 for the hog, brought out on a small plate. No fuss, just perfect.

The beer selection is really good and changes seasonally. I got the Hoppy Blonde to start (which I was just so excited that they had a blonde ale, my hops hating brain ignored the hoppy part and ordered it anyway. Thankfully for me, it was just a hint of hops and not enough to make it unenjoyable.) i moved onto the Southern Tier 2xpresso, which I'm now going to look for all the time. So tasty.

But the real reason I needed to write this review was the Mac and Cheese because holy crap! So damn good. I got the Smokehouse, which is made with Gouda cheese (and if you've stumbled on any others of my reviews, you know Gouda is precious to me,) pulled pork, and a Memphis bbq sauce, topped with breadcrumbs, and a huge pretzel stick on the side. YOU GUYS. I want to go back immediately, but I know when I do, I'll be torn between ordering the Mac and Cheese and a pulled pork sandwich because the pork in the mac was so perfect, I needed more. 

But since I'm planning on making this a regular haunt, I guess I can rotate that choice."}
{"text":"Solid wings (not the very best in the 'burgh in my opinion, but definitely up there).  Excellent place to watch Steelers or Pens (I think there are about 4 TVs visible at a minimum from every seat in the establishment).  Average/slightly above average beer selection.

Overall, pretty damn good.

This place - as other reviewers will tell you too - used to be Kaib's.  Kaib's sauce lives on (now called BT's Original) thank the good Lord.  They really did an excellent job cleaning the place up.  It totally went from solid dive bar that just so happens to have decent wings to solid Pittsburgh bar (which is synonymous with sports, to me).

My advice: expect a dive and be wildly impressed."}
{"text":"This is a terrific little neighborhood bar with a very, very popular wing night on Wednesdays.  Be prepared to wait, but the large variety of sauces are intriguing.  In our first visit, we sampled four, and the winner was:  Honey Garlic Habanero.  Just perfect.  The signature (award-winning) wings have that palm oil taste that I associate with theater popcorn.  Tasty.  The cajun dry rubbed wings are nicely seasoned.  The wet cajun wings also had a bit of that palm oil flavor.  They do a nice job with their tap selection, and there were some nice craft beers available.  A plate came by with a kielbasa sausage that looked and smelled amazing.  Next time I stop by, that's what I'm going to try.  My ONLY complaint is that it's kind of ridiculously loud in the bar area, and I don't understand how the servers are able to communicate with their customers.  Somebody put an EQ on that sound system and scoop out the high mids (2.5k specifically), please!  The outdoor patio area was full of patrons, and there was a well-organized waiting list for tables.  We were lucky enough to find a pair of bar seats open together and snatched them up, but wow, the ambient volume of the room was around 95 db on my sound meter.  Outside would have been more comfortable for us, sound-wise, but the atmosphere inside is fun.  Our impression of the serving staff as quite favorable.  Engaging and friendly people both in the hostess area and at the bar.  We will be back to explore the menu further, and it's no wonder that the wings in this place have been recognized as the city's best.  They are quite good."}
{"text":"Kaib's has gone away, in it's stead, The Bigham Tavern. What's old is new again! Before this building was \"Kaib's\" it was known for years as Bigham Tavern, the new owners are planning big things and a new menu. Urban legend says that the Waner brothers who played for the Pittsburgh Pirated in the early twentieth century drank at the Bigham Tavern before and after games. So this bar has a lot of history. I wish the new owners luck!"}
{"text":"Great find for visitors from out of town. We are for work and don't like chains. We found Bingham Tavern on Yelp. We thought the reviews sounded great so we came on over for dinner. Our waitress Katelyn was fabulous."}
{"text":"was with a group and was fortunate to come on Wing Day Wednesday-I had the Memphis sweet barbecue wings which were delicious-the salad-french fries-onion rings-all delicious-the whole group left satisfied-a little slow yet worth it"}
{"text":"Anyone telling you these aren't some of the best wings in the city is either biased or incompetent."}
{"text":"Great food,  great drinks,  friendly staff.   A lot of fun nights at the BT.  This has been my choice hangout for about 3 years now and sometimes the crowd changes but I always manage to know at least one or two folks in the crowd.   

They recently redid the menu and killed it.  Great hangout for a group of friends,  quick bite for lunch or after work and be sure to cure your Saturday hangover on Sunday morning with Kellys Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"I visited this place years ago when it was still Kaib's. It was decent, a little dingy and the food was average. Whoever bought the place did a very good job at transforming it! The place looks updated and the food is awesome! With countless wing sauces and regular dining food as well incase you're not one for bar food. Prices are about average, could be a little cheaper but the clean atmosphere and service makes up for it. They also have great drink specials as well. We've been going on Sundays for $3 Blue Moons. The bartenders are also very nice and helpful. Another positive is the plethora of TVs. I've never been here in the day, but there are two dining rooms attatched from the bar that seem pretty nice. Not sure if they're open after normal \"restaurant\" hours."}
{"text":"I have lived in Mt. Washington for a good while but it has taken me too long of a time to make it to Bigham for what I have heard is great food. Luckily, I have had the chance to go there twice recently and I think it is time for a review! 

The first time I went, I ordered the mac n' cheese. I always get mac. It is how I judge the universe. I got the loaded mac and it was really good. It also came with a pretzel stick that is never anything to be upset about. My boyfriend got the wings and really liked them as well. The meal was good and the service was great!

The second time we went was for brunch. I got a sausage omelet with tomato, onion and American cheese. I was a little bit sad though because I couldn't find any of the cheese so I think it may have been left out. The potatoes were really good so I wasn't that upset about the cheese. Unfortunately, we were on a time crunch and the service was pretty slow. Our waitress was very nice but kept disappearing. Overall, I won't slight the place for some small bumps but I will probably stick to the mac n' cheese next time."}
{"text":"The wings are fantastic, don't stray. Just got a Reuben to go and it was a handful of dry corned beef thrown in the middle of the bread, I could see the sauerkraut but it wasn't enough to taste it, and no dressing or cheese. Basically a ball of not great meat on dry toast for $9. Again, the wings my husband got were good...? He could eat wings all day every day, I like actual food... I've tried several sandwiches and they all haven't been very good. Hey they got good beer and wings tho!"}
{"text":"Only moved to Pittsburgh a little over two months ago and I can honestly say I've been to the Bigham at least once a week. The service is great and the food is incredible. And don't even get me started on brunch. Pulled bacon and mimosa pitchers. That's what they sold me on. But I keep coming back for the mac and cheese. Don't sleep on the desserts either."}
{"text":"Bingham Tavern is my favorite place to get wings on Mt. Washington.  The wings are VERY good and they have a variety of flavors. The macaroni and cheese dishes makes this a nice spot for a date.  The sandwich and burger selection is above average, although I think they try to do a little to much with the burgers, they could use a more traditional option. 

The service and staff are very strong overall, they are friendly and timely.  Even when the bar is crowded they are properly staffed to serve all patrons.  Not something that can be said about many establishments.  

My ONLY complaint is that the wings go from a 9/10 in the restaurant to VERY hit or miss when you get them carry out.  We used to get them every Sunday carryout but the quality has been very poor recently and I think sometimes I've even gotten wings that had been sitting out or re-sauced. It is very disappointing that the quality when getting carryout is so poor.  Also if you are a stickler for ranch / blue cheese - make sure you double check before you leave they are very forgetful."}
{"text":"I'm a tourist who stumbled upon this place after riding the Duquesne Incline and seeing no other reasonably priced eat/drink options. Our server was Liz and she was rad! There were all kinds of beer options that were mostly $3-$5 per pint. Everything we ordered was good. Caesar salad, pork poppers (happy hour app), cheesesteak. I really liked the Gnarly and Honey Garlic Habanero flavored wings. Also, we had our 7 year old and 13 month old with us who were welcomed during daytime hours."}
{"text":"It has been quite a long time since I have been to this establishment. I have been telling myself that I had to come back and try it out again and I am happy I was finally able to. The place has certainly changed since I was last here.
   The hostess was a little unusual with her etiquette, being very passive and not very welcoming, but I wasn't going to let that ruin my spirits! The dining room was clean and had plenty of seating, with booths and tables. There are TVs in every view point, no matter where you are sitting. We were greeted by our server within a couple minutes. 
   The server was very friendly and was knowledgeable about the menu items and was able to give good advice on what to order for the wing flavors (there are over 30 to choose from!)I found the jackal flavor very good and the wings were nice and crispy. I had also ordered their buffaloaded tots. Can we say yum! They were crispy on the outside and when you bite into them you get a great taste of cheese and bacon! So good.
   All week long they have amazing specials on drink and $5 apps during happy hour(which is 5-7pm Mon-Fri). They have 17 beers on tap and plenty of bottled beer(over 100). Every Tuesday they have acoustic music at 6/630pm. They also offer BBQ, build your own burgers, salads, all kinds of different Mac n cheese, flat beads and even tacos! 
   With the food being as tasty as it was and the service so attentive and pleasant, I will definitely be coming back to try more items! Definitely a thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"I love BT. I usually go in alone and the servers still treat me well (which usually doesn't happen when I'm solo at most other bars). Their food is so tasty! Wing night is a must. Get there a little early before it gets crowded. The wing sauces are amazing. On my to-try list are their burgers but I'm too hooked on the wings. Great drinks too and an awesome happy hour round out the greatness of BT.

I have since had their burgers and they were fantastic. Now I am torn when I go between wings and burgers!! Also I've always had good service from the wait staff and bar tenders. One of these I'll try the Mac and cheese if I can tear myself away from wings and burgers!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Pittsburg so I told my Lyft driver I wanted to try a place unique to the city/state. Tucked off on Mt Washington this local restaurant is a true gem.The staff is very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is energetic! But what is a restaurant review without me talking about their FOOD! 

A couple of frequent customers told me I couldn't go wrong with anything on the menu; which I undoubtedly believe, but it was the clever puns that described their homemade wing sauces that lured me in. Needless to say I was thoroughly pleased. So much so that when the waitress mentioned TRIVIA, I had to go back that same day for their trivia night. (It's on Thursdays)

The place was busy both times so larger parties be prepared for a potential wait.  There will certainly be something about the place that everyone in the group enjoys."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Bigham Tavern! I've heard they have a build your own Mac n cheese menu so it's been on my list of places to try for quite a while. Unfortunately I still haven't tried the Mac n cheese but I have tried the brunch and I absolutely loved it.

Their brunch menu had so many different options it was difficult to decide. The first time I ended up getting the chili pierogie bowl. It seemed different so why not give it a whirl. I added jalapeños to mine and it was AMAZING. The second time I did the buffalo tots and some boneless wings. Both were delicious but I have a small complaint. There weren't more than 15 tots on the plate which was only disappointing because it seemed a bit pricey for the quantity. The quality was however not a issue."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere and the food was all really good. Cheesesteak sandwich with house chips and blue cheese burger with fries both very tasty. The waitresses were friendly but the service of food was slow. I have to admit that there were 3 parties going on at the same time. This place is out of my local area or I would go back often."}
{"text":"Favorite place ever. I find myself here about once a week, and do not plan on changing that any time soon!

The atmosphere is lively and fun. This place is always crowded- so just be prepared. They have great happy hour specials and a lot of different drinks options (both beer and cocktails), that are changing often.

Appetizer- you have to get the hot pepper cheese balls
Sandwich- my favorite veggie burger in town! My husband says the Buffalo chicken sandwich is amazing too.
GET THE WINGS! gnarley!

Service is always SUPER nice and accommodating. Sara (I believe is the manager) has always been more than helpful. The food can take awhile- so grab a drink and be patient.

Only complaint is the brunch menu. You cannot get anything that is not on it and the options aren't that great. So we usually wait until after brunch to go for our beer mosas!"}
{"text":"Such a warm welcoming place. The bar staff is absolutely amazing. The hamburgers are delicious."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I love this place. The sandwiches are all amazing. The bread is so fresh and the serving size of the protein (burger, patty, lunchmeat etc) is huge and filling. The mac n cheese. Holy wow is it so creamy and cheesy! The fresh cut fries and house chips are always welcome sides for anything you can order.

Happy hour is 5-7 with $1 off drafts, $2 domestic bottles, $3 well drinks and I believe $5 house wine. There are a few $5 apps such as smaller portions of loaded fries and tots and a pizza. But they're still a good size to share or make a meal.

Wing night is Wednesday with $.66 wings (due to the national shortage). Coyote is by far the best dry rub. I will say though that the last few times I've gotten wings they've not been as Meaty. They also weren't dusted or sauced very thoroughly. 

Street parking is found by the grace of god some nights and they do have a tiny lot attached to them. I highly recommend using the Nowait app, especially on wing nights"}
{"text":"All I can say is absolutely yes, must go!  Some of the best bar food in the Burgh!! The best Ham and Cheese sandwich I've ever had, great wings, great burgers!!! The Mac and Cheese was the only thing we didn't care for, but Bigham Tavern is a favorite!"}
{"text":"Cute place up in Mt. Washington. I'm in Pittsburgh at least a couple times a month and always make a point to grab a meal when I'm here. Friendly bar tenders, tasty pirogies, and good macaroni and cheese! Good sized bar and fair amount of seating in the rest of the place although on the small side but I think that adds to the atmosphere of the place? Always pleased :)"}
{"text":"Always great service and a great environment. Who can beat the new Mac n cheese menu?! In my opinion the best place to go on Mt Washington."}
{"text":"Love this spot one of my favorites and regular places! Go here. Great food great beers great people. Wings amazing. Brunch amazing"}
{"text":"This place has made some drastic improvements since it changed over from Kaib's. While it is a little more pricey, it is still incredibly affordable, with most items on the menu being under $10. Newly revamped menu, with a bunch of items that I haven't tried yet, but everything I have had so on it is pretty good quality. They have some of best wings in the city, in fact I think they were just voted so, with over 20 different kinds of sauces, and 44 cent wing nights on Wednesdays, or during any Pirates, Steelers, or Pens game. Not all of the flavors will blow your taste buds, but there are definitely a handful that keep me coming back on a regular basis. (I would recommend the Red Hot Honey, or the Gnarly if you like spicy).  Their beer selection seems to be growing on almost a monthly basis. With a pretty decent variety on draft, and rather large selection in bottle. This is a great place to watch any sporting event, with TV's visible for almost any point in the bar, and often big crowds to cheer along side.

This is also a great place to come chill. In their back room they have 2 pool tables and a dartboard, and this summer they are planning on building a large deck, which should provide a nice place for some outdoor dining.

My biggest complaint with this place is some what poor wait staff. Don't get this confused with their bartenders, which always seem to be friendly and hardworking, but they often seem to cycle through waitresses that move incredibly slow, and are never around when you need another drink."}
{"text":"Wings here are pretty awesome. Every time I've been it has been pretty busy, certainly a good crowd for the most part, especially for Mt Washington"}
{"text":"Pretty cool bar and a neat area of town. Off the beaten path of regular tourist attractions.   Place has been around for a long time and the Mac n Cheese options are plentiful and pretty good. Relaxed atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Though we ordered mostly \"bar food\", the quality was great. We had the cheese bites and loaded tater tots first. The cheese bites were good, but the tater tots were excellent. We then decided to give the wings a try because we'd learned that this place had won best wings in the city five straight years. Now we know why!!  We had original buffalo as well as the dry rub that was recommended. The wings were cooked to perfection and the flavors were very unique and very tasty. 
We also shared the buffalo Mac and cheese, which again, was...you guessed it...amazing. 
My wife had the Moscow mule and loved it. The beer choices were solid. 
We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Took the Duquesne cable box up the hill and searched for a lunch stop. Found this place and was not diasppointed. Overall great food, friendly service and comfy setting. 
The place is split into the bar area and the restaurant area.  The restaurant is sort of hidden in a residential neighborhood but easy to spot as you walk or drive by. Parking seemed scarce, I did not see a parking lot from the side I approached. 
I had the corn and shrimp chowder which was super tasty and the #1 BT burger. The burger was cooked just as requested and the bun was crisp and toasted as I like it. This burger was huge!!!  Unless you can unhinge your jaw you are not eating this in full bites. Sauce was tasty and so many flavors combine to really satisfy both appetite and taste.  I upgraded to the flavored curly fries, very tasty as well but we're the froze and deep fried instead of fresh made.  They also have a full mac and cheese section of various mac and cheese dishes, I would love to come back and try some!! I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The buffalo tots are fantastic along with the smokehouse Mac. Did a flight of beer and that was perfect. Serving could be a little faster as my garden salad was the last thing to come out, which I thought was weird. But overall it was a good stop while up on the inclines... off the path which is nice."}
{"text":"Went to Bigham Tavern on Mt. Washington but off the beaten path for the Steeler's playoff games this year.  Lot of fun, it's gotten so popular that they've added a heated tent to accommodate more fans.  There literally is well one bad seat in the house for a game.  Those aren't bad odds?  They have excellent bar food.  Highly recommend the chicken tenders but all there food looks tasty.  The DJ played your classic Steeler's Pittsburgh Polka, and 'Here we Go' songs during the commercials and was careful to bring the volume back so no one missed a play.  Bigham is also big on Thursday nights and check their calendar for events.  Cool alternative to the main drag on Mt. Washington.  It's 3 blocks off of Grand Street.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Bigham is one of the best places in Pittsburgh to eat! I come here regularly for brunch, lunch and dinner and the meals never disappoint. Brunch is a must with their veggie skillet and the big breakfast being my personal favorite- paired with their awesome list of brunch cocktails, you won't be disappointed. anything I've ever gotten here has been delicious! The servers are always kind and attentive. the only downside is the limited parking. I'll never stop coming here!"}
{"text":"I love this place once it reopened! I live nearby and it's a nice place to hang out for wing night or just to have a beer. It is often very crowded but the waitress I had on the most crowded night still did a good job of making sure we were taken care of. The wings and beer were great. The menu is varied and everything I tried tasted good - plus, the prices were pretty reasonable. Nice hangout on Mt. Wash!"}
{"text":"Just moved up to Mt. Washington and this may be my new 'go to' when I don't feel like cooking.
They have an extensive menu that covers all the apps you want when drinking (lightly or heavily) as well as heavy entres that can certainly put you in a food coma.

I ordered the Bayou Burger with a side of onion rings...and 'tickled pickles' because I can't resist deep fried pickles.

The burger was cooked perfectly and stuffed with jalapenos and pepper jack marrying the flavor with onion crisps and sriracha mayo on top. It had two fried pickles which I tossed on the burger and the bun was good too. All in all a good experience for my mouth.

That isn't the best part though. They have a pretty extensive beer menu from your lite garbage to your heavy IPAs and lagers- Throw in a few ciders, a nice wine menu and a weekly 12 draft rotation with TV's at every convenient angle and outdoor seating now...You have my new watering hole.

Only draw back is they charge for every addition of anything. .50 for sauce, .75 to add this, $1 to add that. They are not pricey overall, but add a few things to your meal here and there and you'll find yourself spending no less than $30 for a burger and a drink or two."}
{"text":"Update : 

I spoke with the brewer and a few managers I work with and they agreed it might not have been the beer but it is more likely that the lines could be to blame.. that would explain why 2 beers from Bigham would have made me sick.. I still won't be returning here regardless. 
I hope this helps someone !! 


This is the second time I've had their southern tier 2xipa within 4 weeks and it's made me sick. That is my beer of choice when I'm out to dinner but I'm guessing their keg has gone bad. 

I work at a brewery and have never ever felt the way I did after I've drank the 2xipa. Take the beer off the tap. I won't ever drink here again. Not worth it!"}
{"text":"A 4.5 star lunch and dinner with a 2 star brunch equals 3 stars all around. 

I need to start off by saying that, for the past few years, this is probably my most frequented neighborhood food joint. I order food at Bigham at least twice a month. I've had way more good than bad experiences here. I love the build your own burger, build your own Mac & Cheese, and build your own salads. The soups are good and the hummus is out of this world! 

They have the second best wings in town and an extensive wing sauce list. It's definitely worth it to check this place out on Wednesday (wing night). 

I've been here twice for brunch. Once on purpose and once by accident (I told myself I'd never go back for brunch but forgot brunch ran until 2pm on weekends) Both times it took well over an hour to get our food and food came out cold. A dry, crumbly, and cold waffle is not the best way to start your day. On the second brunch go around 1 out of 4 of us enjoyed what we ordered. So disappointing! 

Service used to be absolutely amazing, but I've noticed that it's not quite as consistent as of late."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with friends during my visit to Pittsburgh.  The atmosphere is like a sports bar. There were several tv's, large bar, and lively patrons. Patio dining is also an option. The food and drink menus offer a wide variety of choices. Our waitress, Beverly,  was really sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. She was also very attentive. I had chicken tacos and my friends had perogies and a chicken wrap.The chicken tacos were very tasty and fresh. I liked the cilantro sauce. My friends enjoyed their food. I would love to come here again and try more menu items."}
{"text":"If there was ever a restaurant that personified Pittsburgh, it would certainly be Bigham Tavern. Tucked away on Mount Washington on the corner of Bigham St and Virginia Ave, this is certainly a stop worth making.

The atmosphere here oozes that, \"hometown-feel-good\" kind of vibe, which is only amplified by the wonderfully attentive and friendly staff. Upon walking in, you have the option to sit at the large wrap around bar, or take a seat in one of their several booths and tables. There truly is not a bad seat in the house!

With regard to the menu:
Bigham is infamous for their Wednesday wing night! Also affectionally referred to as Wingsday, the wings are served as flats&drums, or boneless if that's your kind of thing. Yuengling is on special for $3 and wings are $0.50. Very reasonably priced, given the national chicken wing shortage (yes, that's seriously a thing). There's also a wide variety of sauces to choose from, Cluckin' Hot being my absolute favorite (Yes, it is indeed Cluckin' Hot) and Jackal coming in second (think, hot honey mustard). In addition, BT is also known for their mac and cheese, which is well worth whatever amount of calories are in it! The mac and cheese can be served several different ways, and is always brought out in a toasty skillet with a fluffy pretzel bread stick to complete for dipping, yum! You cannot go wrong choosing anything on the menu.

Living in the Pittsburgh area, you see several restaurants come and go. Brigham Tavern is one of those places that has become a PGH fixture, and for good reason!"}
{"text":"They've changed a lot since the evolution from Kaib's into BT. The menu is way different and the prices went up, but the food is still good and everyone is still nicer here than another similar establishment located on Shiloh...

Wing flavor menu is HUGE now! Huge and delicious. I loved the wings when it was only 4 flavors to choose from, and I love them even more that they got creative with them and made about 30 more. Also, tons more beers to choose from. And clean fresh lines in their tap system.

They're putting in an outdoor patio soon and I'm pretty sure it should be ready for summer '12. Since I live about a block away, I'm sure ill be spending a lot more time there once they have the outdoor spot. I'm a sucker for a good patio.

My one gripe is they only had beer battered fries for about a month when they first switched over. That was enough to make me fall in love with them, then they took them away and I've been whiney about it ever since. Need those damn fries back in my life"}
{"text":"This a a neighborhood bar just outside of the city. It turned out to be such a great find! They offer basic pub fare and some specials. That night they had a meat loaf special. However we opted for the pork poppers, wings, and burgers. The poppers are filled with tender, juicy, and flavorful pulled BBQ pork and cheese, coated with a beer batter type breading, and served with BBQ sauce for dipping. They were delish! The wings were cooked just right and the sauces are phenominal! OMG! you may not be able to find another burger as good as the ones they have here! They are made from an aged sirloin and they have such a rich flavor! Our burgers were cooked perfectly! Of course we got way too much food and couldn't finish it all. But, we tried our darndest because every bite was mouth watering! The burgers are served with house made potato chips. Get those and don't do the up sell. they are really good chips and you can't go wrong! To top it off they have a fantastic beer list! And apparently this is a great place to watch sports. There was a hockey game on the night that we were there. If we are ever in Pittsburgh again we are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Went for the wings as I've heard how great they are.

First, the good:  wings were cooked to my liking, menu was interesting, drinks were good, and the place has a cool vibe with a giant bar area and nice tables.  The coyote flavor wings are fantastic.  5 star on that flavor of dry rub.

The bad:  my girlfriend had breakfast tacos and she said the eggs were like instant scrambled eggs and that the tacos weren't hot.  We also ordered pulled bacon and it was a big let down being slightly cold and not as good as regular crispy bacon.

All that being said I'd certainly go again to try more wings.  Also, we parked up the block and walked 200 yards down and had no issue with street parking."}
{"text":"The veggie burger was good but everything else - including loudness, wait, service, and the rest of the food - was abysmal. I'm pretty sure they forgot a few items and left most of the order under a heat lamp until they corrected the order."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, good environment, fun trivia, good wings. Can't go wrong with this place. I have been here several times and I always enjoy it. 

This time we got the van nachos. I wished they would have had more toppings other than cheese. They were good, but fairly plain. I also had the grilled romaine. It had good flavor. Had a smoky roasted flavor with a sweet balsamic vinegar."}
{"text":"Hubby and I strolled to the Bigham from the incline early Friday evening on the recommendation of one of the incline staff.  We started with the tickled pickles which were perfect and then he had the giant fish and house chips.  Another winner.  I had the Greek salad that was fresh, tasty and perfectly sized.  No anchovies was a bummer, though.

Service was pleasant and knowledgeable, but stretched a bit.  Atmosphere was lively and clientele was every age 1-100.  Ok. 1-75...  Liked the mix.  One missing star because we thought there could be a chance that the table or benches could simply collapse without notice - I kept a firm hold of my Angry Orchard.

Would definitely go back.  Much easier to fix a table than a menu + a happy staff makes or breaks a restaurant experience.  Next time wings!"}
{"text":"Came in on New Year's Day and it wasn't terribly busy but we had a short wait. Our waitress was great but the food did take awhile to come out. We had some beer mimosas and Bloody Marys to keep us occupied though so not bad overall. We came in at lunch time but there was still a breakfast special of eggs, bacon, pancakes and toast. I couldn't have enjoyed my meal more. Some of the best eggs I've had at a restaurant in a long time, thick bacon slices and very fluffy pancakes. The place has a great bar atmosphere with tons of TVs with football games on. This will probably be one of the go-to joints when home and in the Mt. Washington area."}
{"text":"So Bigham Tavern has changed. They have taken off beers, desserts, wing flavors and other items off of their menu but have not updated their menu. Very frustrating and no more giant cookie with ice cream! No more Memphis sweet wing sauce!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times and the food has been great. Tonight, we ordered take out.. Just a simple chicken sandwich-wings-and a grilled cheese burger. We get halfway home (we live 20 minutes away), and the hostess called to tell us we got the wrong order. She said she would come and deliver our food and that was great... But brings me to my 1 star at the same time. Got our order at our door about an hour later.... Absolutely just a grilled cheese sandwich, no burger on there, along with my husbands chicken sandwich being a chicken tender cut in half placed on a bun with lettuce... No cheese. Please don't order out from here. Although trying to make it right was great.... Probably should have put a little effort into it because it wasn't our fault we picked up the wrong order. Had no idea this was like McDonald's and had to check the bag before we leave. Altogether, need a better system.. And if you mess something up the first time please try carefully the second time to get it correct. Won't be going here for a long time."}
{"text":"I chose Bigham Tavern for my birthday dinner spot. I've heard nothing but great things about the food and it's been on my bucket list for more than a year. I made a reservation a week in advance (good thing because the place was absolutely packed). The tavern is located in a residential area, that gives it a neighborhood hang-out feel. We arrived around 8pm and planned to have a few drinks at the bar, but there were no seats at the bar. Luckily they were able to seat us at the table earlier than I'd reserved it. 

Everything was sloooowwww. We ordered drinks and two appetizers (pierogies and nachos) to kick off the meal. Drinks didn't come for almost 15 minutes. The appetizers took about 25 minutes. We asked for forks so we could eat the appetizers and the waitress never brought them. It took 15 minutes for our second round of drinks to appear from the bar. Our meals eventually came out, and we still did not have silverware... so we waited another 5 minutes for that before we could eat. It was so loud and crowded. You couldn't talk to anyone but the person sitting next you without yelling. From our seat we could see our waitress had to push through people at the bar just to get the drinks. So I can't totally blame her, even though she wasn't a ball of fire... it was easy to see where the logistics in this place are lacking. 

The food was good. I had a dozen wings and loved them. Between us all, we also ordered the Taco-Mac (wayyy SPICY), the Fish Sandwich, Cheesesteak, and Fish Tacos. Everyone said they had a nice meal, but weren't really WOW-ed. I don't think you should ever wait over an hour for bar food. We'd planned on staying for drinks, but it took so long to get the first two rounds, we all just left. I think the loud atmosphere, lacking service, and slow kitchen really ruined any chances for an enjoyable celebration. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I was recently at Bigham Tavern for a Yelp event and the owners of Bigham Tavern wanted to receive feedback on their new brunch menu.  

We also had a chance to order items from the Bigham Tavern's regular menu.  You CANNOT go wrong with their wings!  We ordered the Hyena, Gnarly and Dingo wings.  All the wings were well prepared, perfectly cooked and the sauces were superb!   That Shorty Mac with beef short ribs, creamy smoked gouda and scallions was \"Smack Ya Momma\" good!  The only dish that just okay were the Pulled Pork Poppers.  The pork could have used more of a peppery bite and they were served somewhat lukewarm.  Add some more heat (both temperature and seasoning wise) and they will have a definite hit on their hands.  Additionally, the service was spectacular!   Friendly, knowledgeable and extremely attentive to our table.  Great service is not to be underestimated.

I would go back in a heartbeat and go with a designated driver, so that I don't accidentally roll down the hill after eating so much!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to a lot of restaurants during our trips to Pittsburgh, but the one place we always talk about is Bigham Tavern. There's a reason this place has been featured on tv. Their menu is filled with delicious food and they give you enough to keep you filled up for the rest of the day. If you're in the mood to eat out and want to do it right, this is the place to go to. One of the bonuses of coming here is the opportunity eat above the city due to its Mount Washington location. It definitely gives you a different perspective of the city when you take the trip up there. But mostly, it's the amazing food that keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a composite review as I've been to this Tavern maybe 8 times.  Several times general dining (always in the front by the window), and a few other times at the bar.  Many would call this an old style local watering hole -- but the menu is solid for a bar and grille, and service was always excellent.  The bar per se makes a great sports bar given the number of monitors, and there is a back room with more monitors.  I can only imagine a Steeler's game and how packed the place would be.  There is an outside area that would have a \"3 season\" run if/when they used outdoor heaters.  Lots of people from the nearby Chatham Village area appear to hang out after 4 pm or so."}
{"text":"Superior service !!   Absolutely  best tacos!!!! Bartenders and servers work as a team.     Cannot wait to try other menu items !!"}
{"text":"I ate here a few months ago with a friend and had never before heard of the place. It's a traditional bar 'n' grill, typical of what you'd find in Pittsburgh city neighborhoods. 

Now I only tried the hot wings, complete with celery and ranch dressing. 

Can you say Crispy, Crunchy, Tangy, So Tender It Might As Well Be A Communion Wafer Splendor? 

MMMmm. I used to take hot wings for granted. Kaib's made me fall in love all over again.

 I remember when they used to call 'em Wing Dings around here back in the day.

Minor caveat: The joint is loud and rowdy on a Saturday night. Pick a different time to dine here unless you have a high tolerance for the obnoxious and the imbibed."}
{"text":"Wingsday, how can you go wrong!  $.44 wings on Wednesday, so we had to stop by craving some good wings.  
Tacos are $2.50 for those that don't like wings.  BT is a good neighborhood bar with friendly service and real good crispy wings.  A nice selection of beers on tap and about 20 wing flavors that are rated 1 to 5 on the menus heat index.  We had the BT Original and the Dingo.  Both were very good.  Neither are real hot or spicy but with a nice flavor and just a little kick.  If you like spicy you may want to go to the 3 or 4 on the heat index.
I'm sure we will be back for Wingsday."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with anything here. Great fish sandwiches, wings and appetizers. Love the fried pickles and my fiancée likes the pepper cheese bites."}
{"text":"Decent bar and grille. The service was tremendous for a busy, Wednesday Wing Night. The bar was full but the dining room area was comfortable. I ordered the pretzel sticks with bier cheese and honey mustard which were soft, steamy and buttery. My date ordered hot cheese balls, a spin on traditional fried cheese curds. They also were hot and spicy but still tasty. 

I've been here time and time and again, and I pretty much know what I'm getting myself into. My only beef was that my pork tacos weren't very flavorful. Next time I'll just order wings like I normally do. All-in-all, not a disappointing experience, but definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"While visiting Pittsburgh for a long weekend & annual Pirates game with friends, we found Bigham Tavern on Yelp since we were unfamiliar with restaurants in Mt. Washington. The Uber driver informed us that this place was hard to find. It wasn't. His GPS took us right to the address & he dropped us off at the front door. 

Food was very good. It may have tasted even better because we were all nursing hangovers and it was the first meal of the day. Either way, my Cuban was very good. Everyone had wings & we all agreed they were the best item we ate. We also ordered the loaded tots, which were different than I thought they'd be, but good anyway. I have nothing negative to say. Bigham is a dark, old, sorta divey, bar/restaurant good for nursing a hangover or late night drinks/snacks. We'll be back, Bigham."}
{"text":"This used to be a decent place, but our last visit this past weekend proved otherwise.  Me and five of my friends thought it'd be a good place to go and grab a few beers and play some darts.  We've been there before, decent beers and a somewhat decent atmosphere.  Not this time.  We got our first round, a couple beers and a bucket.  After that, two of our friends were at the bar for 25 MINUTES and didn't get served!!!  They moved to different parts of the bar also, and the bartenders, TWO OF THEM, blatantly ignored them.  We came out because we were playing darts in the back and wondered what was taking so long, we skipped their turns about 5 times already, I even loudly said to the one bartender, \"Excuse me!\" but she purposely ignored me.  I guess we weren't douchey enough, because it seems like you have to wear a too tight polo shirt and have a false sense of entitlement to get good service there.   Well they lost out on about $200 Friday night because we were going to stay there for the night and drink, but for some reason we weren't good enough to be served.  The six of us that were there will never set foot in there again, and we told all of our friends about our horrible service that night and they will not go there either.  Maybe the owner doesn't give a shit and thinks he has enough business, but when bad word gets around, no matter how many customers you have, it's bad for business.  All I know is that roughly 20 people that would have considered going there before will DEFINITELY not set foot in there again.  You can thank your horrible bartenders for that, Bingham Tavern."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the service I got today. I'm still currently waiting for a table and I got here at 7pm. Half of my party left and went somewhere else. There are so many empty tables that I'm wondering what they are waiting on? I understand the kitchen us backed up but at least give the option to seat and wait. I've been coming here for 4 years now watching the game, but if this is how it's going to be, I'll go else where."}
{"text":"The bartenders were very friendly and the wings were amazing! Very good beer selection and a cool, tavern atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was very good but the wait was very very long.  They also misunderstood my order, but were willing to fix it so I wasn't charged extra."}
{"text":"Awesome wings and food in general.  Great atmosphere...excellent beer selection.  I was in town from Delaware for the Steelers/Broncos game and had my Broncos garb on.  Bigham Tavern staff were super friendly and helpful.....Loved the place as much as I love Pittsburgh.  ....great Tavern in a Great City...I read all the reviews before we went and knew it would be good because so may 4 and 5 stars...I discounted the few one stars from those individuals who apparently feel that they should be treated like Royalty....bartenders and servers have very difficult jobs.  During my visit I did not see one staff person stop moving for even a minute...keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a wing place and based on the reviews, we gave this place a try.  The reviews didn't lie.  The wings are awesome.  Crispy and juicy, just the way I like them.  I tried the garlic parm wings and my boyfriend had the buffalo and cajun dry wings.  We also had the fresh cut fries with cheese.  All was delicious and because the Pirates were playing the wings were $0.44 each.  I will also note that their wing night is Wednesday.  The bar is very nice and they have a lot of tv's to watch sports.  The only downfall is parking.  There is some construction next door and I am hoping it's for a parking lot.  Regardless, I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm glad I was able to stop in here for lunch with a group of 9 while exploring the Mr. Washington area. Like the majority of the people we saw, my group took the lift up here to do a little exploring and see the awesome views of the city. The location of this restaurant isn't quite as convenient as a lot of other places, but if you feel like making the short hike past the line of all of the other restaurants in the area to come here, you won't be disappointed.

They easily accommodated our large group by pushing a couple of tables together, and we were quickly helped by a waitress who did a great job throughout our entire visit. They have a great selection of rotating beers on draft, including plenty of local selections. In bottles, they have an even better selection and even offer some specialty bombers that you can usually only find in nice beer stores. Being from out of town, it was nice that they made a big effort to highlight which of the breweries on their list were local, as I always try to drink local when traveling.

The menu is a mix of mostly appetizers, sandwiches/burgers, and wings. They also have some flatbreads, quesadillas, salads, and soups. Just reading the majority of the descriptions of the offerings might have actually contributed to blocking a few of my arteries, and it didn't take long to realize that healthy dining is not a priority here. If you like crazy foods that will force you to loosen you belt a notch or two, you'll fit right in here. I seriously considered getting the \"big ham\", which is a combination of baked ham, glazed ham, smoked ham, honey roasted ham, capicola, bacon, swiss, and dark mustard all served on a Kaiser bun. As tempting as that sounded, it seemed a little heavy for lunch. A plethora of other sandwiches followed a similar model with a big piles of ingredients that will please the pallet but knock a few years off the life expectancy. One person in our group was brave enough to get the grilled cheese cheeseburger, which is a half pound burger with both the top and bottom buns replaced by grilled cheese and bacon sandwiches.

I went with the wings, as they were advertised as \"undisputedly the best in the tri-state area.\" They were good. While I have nothing else to compare it to in Pittsburg, they probably wouldn't make the best of Indy, but would certainly be in the discussion for the top 5. The wings themselves are pretty traditional and a nice size for $10 a dozen, but the sauce options are where things really get interesting. I'd say there are around 25 or so options, and they cover about every flavor profile you could be looking for. Each is categorized on a 0-5 scale for heat, with just about every single on at 2.5 or less. I got the honey garlic habenero which was 1 of the only 3 options that was rated above a 3 on the heat scale, and it was a little disappointing heat-wise. The next step up from it was the atomic at a 5, so maybe a few more options between those would be nice. Their sweet BBQ sauce was good, and I wish I had the option to try a lot more as there were a lot of interesting flavors to choose. Coming here on Wednesday for their wing day with 44¢ wings is definitely a great deal. 

Like I said earlier, our server did great during our visit by keeping drinks filled and getting us everything we need. She even brought out the kids food ASAP so they weren't getting too fidgety waiting for the whole large order to come out at once. The place definitely has a tavern feel to it with plenty of wood and a good number of TVs around the walls. If you are there before 2, at least on a Saturday, they also have a brunch menu but I did not even take a look at that. If I lived around here, I could definitely see this being a place I come to when I felt like I could handle a plethora of calories and fat, but would certainly be a go-to for good beer."}
{"text":"The service is always pretty decent and the food is always GREAT! They have so much to choose from whether it's good or drinks."}
{"text":"We had a huge group of 20+ coming for brunch to start a day of bachelorette celebrations. Sarah was so helpful before we even arrived - emailing and helping to set up our menu to ensure a great experience. We had the whole back patio (heated) to ourselves for no additional charge! The room was tastefully decorated and set up ideally (U shape) for a large group. We opted for food to come out family style. I cannot compliment the food enough! It was delicious, hot (even the eggs!) and plentiful. Everyone had seconds and we still had some left over. Extremely fair pricing, especially considering what you get. Great prices on drinks, too! Huge mimosas and loaded Bloody Marys! Service was incredible, especially considering the large group! No one was ever waiting for anything! Highly, highly recommend. Thank you to Sarah and Bigham Tavern for going above and beyond!"}
{"text":"If you're coming to Mt. Washington you should definitely swing into BT. Fun staff, great food, watch the game, play shuffle board (or shuffle puck...depending on where you're from).
I'm not a vegetarian but the black bean burger has me going there regularly! Addicted.
Great daily specials & definitely a place for the \"locals\". Just a short walk to the overlook of the city."}
{"text":"Ahh, I am so torn between 4 and 5 stars! Overall we had a great time so I am going to err on the higher side...  I haven't been here since before it was Bigham and it's a huge step up from what it once was many years ago. 

Service only gets a 4 because we had to wait quite a long time before anyone came to our table. We were there around 4pm on a Saturday and the place was bustling! But not so busy that it should have taken that long. After we finally were attended to the server was pretty prompt with our drink refills. 

I really wanted to try the mac & cheese but wasn't that hungry so opted for the BT (buffalo chicken) flatbread. My friends split the fried pickles and pulled pork poppers. Everything was very tasty although they forgot to put the celery and carrots with my order. 

The executive chef came and chatted with us and even made us an order of fried rueben balls that weren't on the menu. They were heavenly. And he was so personable! And that definitely helped with the extra star. 

This place seems like a really fun time at night. There were couples, friends, parties with children during the day, so seems like a good all around, inclusive, establishment."}
{"text":"Love this place! Live close so that helps but the beer selection is extensive and ever changing, the staff is personable and attentive the food is great from the burger to the Mac and cheese to the wings, ohh the wings. 30+ flavors and even some that aren't listed on the menu. The Sunday brunch Bloody Mary with \"meat stick\" is the perfect hangover hair of the dog, especially Kelly's version. 

I can't recommend this place enough. A homey dive bar feel (with requisite pleasant staff) but with all the attention to detail and quality food. If I were to start/own a bar Bigham Tavern would be the standard I try to replicate."}
{"text":"Love this place! By far the best wing night I've had in pittsburgh =D I will say the wait gets extremely long on Wednesday Wing Night but the $.44 cent wings are totally worth every minute. They have a large selection of flavors to chose from (over 26 flavors I believe.) If you aren't into wings...dont worry they also have $1.25 tacos the same night plus good beer specials. 

Great place to bring friends and watch sports as well"}
{"text":"I've been to Bigham over 50 times as it is in my neighborhood. I've never had a bad experience there. The food is always great and they offer an impressive craft beer selection. The wings are easily amongst the best in the city. I highly recommend jackal and cluckin hot sauces for fans of the heat."}
{"text":"One Tuesday, I accidentally showed up for a Yelp event a week early.  We had made a special trip to Mount Washington for it, so we decided to stay for dinner.  What a happy mistake! (I'm clearly channeling my inner Bob Ross) The food, service, and prices were all excellent.  We ordered salads, bacon Mac and cheese, sticky wings, and bacon salted caramel cheesecake.  All of which had tons of flavor and were very reasonably priced.  The menu was pretty extensive and diverse (with the exception that bacon was in most dishes), so there were a ton of options for anyone.  We also ordered a bottle of wine because they have half price bottles of wine on Tuesdays! We ordered the Pinot Noir, and it went perfectly with all the comfort food we had ordered.  Our waitress was very pleasant, attentive, and knowledgeable of the menu items.  Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that they also had live entertainment playing mostly 90's soft rock songs....very well might I add.  I will certainly be coming back!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Mt. Washinton! They have so many options to choose from. Mac n cheese is the best. Everything has bacon. It's like heaven. Ask for Lizard she's the best!"}
{"text":"The Bigham Tavern is located on Mt Washington on Bigham Street. The place is easy to miss. The street sign off Virginia Ave is missing!

Once I found it there is street parking available along with a small stone parking lot. When you enter there is a sign that says \"seat yourself.\" Once I selected a booth I met a very nice waitress who showed me the two sided menu and since it was Wed, she said that wings were $.44 each. You can get a choice of various types of sauces ranging from mild to on fire hot sauce.

I saw my favorite French onion soup on the menu and asked about their lunchtime pairing. I was told you can pair any of the following: soup, basic salad, half a sandwich, or mac and cheese for $8.00  That sounded like a great deal so I ordered my soup and half of a Rachel. There are TV sets near every booth. The dining area is small however, they have a large rectangular bar area and I was told they have a back room for special events or parties.

I received my soup first upon request and it was delicious as always. My half Rachel came shortly after and it was just as good. My waitress was very nice and attentive to my needs. I told her how much I really enjoyed my meal and hope to bring my best friend here on a future visit. I asked her if this lunchtime special runs on weekends. She said it did and if I wanted it for dinner then it would be $1.00 more. The price is right for me so am looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I don't even want to tell you about how good the wings are because then it might get more crowded... Really, though, these are the best wings at the best price that I've found in Pittsburgh. They're incredible. They also have some new cocktails that are really delicious and they serve them in cute mason jars. It's perfect for summer."}
{"text":"Love Bigham Tavern. Everything on the menu is delicious and the atmosphere is fun. Never had a bad experience here and recommend to anyone looking for a good place on the Mount!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection.  Very good bar food.  Service improved as the night progressed.  Wings were solid and the Reuben was good."}
{"text":"I was at Bigham Tavern late night on Saint Patrick's Day wknd.  When we arrived the place was full and it was kind of hard to get a beer.  As the night progressed, the crowd thinned out but the bartenders attitude remained the same.  Maybe they just had a long day, but they could have been a little bit nicer especially to people who were not being out of control.  We ordered food around 11:30 pm.  Our server was accommodating but the food was really nothing to rave about.  i originally ordered the pulled pork sliders but the server came back and told me they were out of them so I had the crab cake sliders.  The mayo sauce was a bit overwhelming, the crab cakes were cooked a little too long and the buns were blah."}
{"text":"I had an absolutely terrible experience here. I love the food so much and decided to bring my family of 4 total to have lunch at this location on Sunday 3/18 at 1:00 pm. When we arrived we were told it was a wait time of approximately a 10 to 15 minutes, which was fine. About a half hour went by and we were then told that it would be another 10 to 15 minutes and that the kitchen was very backed up. We were the only ones in the waiting are this whole time. It gets even better from here. So after now waiting 45 minutes we are told that it would now be a half hour longer before we are seated. I asked politely to speak to a manager just to see what was going on and have a conversation. The female manager came out and said \"I hear you aren't very happy\", and when I started to talk about what was happening she then yelled \"I can't pump the food out of the kitchen any faster\" in an angry tone. I said \"i just wanted to have a conversation there is no need to get an attitude\" she then started yelling at us. I told my family we were leaving and won't be ever coming back after this terrible experience. All we were looking for was an apology. This was unacceptable behavior."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great to watch games for any sport. The mac n cheese is amazing. Love doing the build your own."}
{"text":"Bigham is probably my favorite place in Pittsburgh.  

My typical go-to's are the pittsburgh steak sandwhich, the italian hoagie, or any of their burgers.  

They have hands-down the best wing night in the city on Wednesday nights with tons of flavors.  

You can always also have the chicken tenders tossed in your favorite sauce as well.  

Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 2 stars based on repeatedly horrible experience/service - the food has never been a let down and would have been a 5. We live very close by, so it's a convenient spot for us and like I said, the food's always been good... if you don't often mind waiting over an hour for it to hit your table. Last night was wing night so I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, but when we were sat there was no wait. Yes they were busy, but for chicken wings an 1 hour and 15 minutes is ridiculous. Nonetheless, we all worked in restaurants so we understood. What we didn't understand is why our waitress never once acknowledged us or the fact that our food took so long. She walked passed our table multiple times, avoiding us even to refill our drinks until we asked her if she knew how much longer it would be. She messed up our checks, and avoided the entire situation. After an hour and a half we asked for a box (at that point we weren't even hungry anymore) and she informed us a box was $5. The wings are only 44 cents! We had 6 left, which made the box more than the food. Again, I understand the reasoning but after she just saw her table wait over an hour for their food without even apologizing or even trying to come up with an excuse, she could have been a little nicer and handled it better. One night we went here for a drink and there were about 5 people in the bar, including 2 bartenders - both of whom were visibly, blatantly intoxicated. Unfortunately I'm not sure if we'd ever go back for food unless we ordered it as takeout (and I know we'd never go back for wing night!). Again - the food is great. One point. You'd just be better off getting it to go or when you have a whole night to waste being avoided by your server. Wish I could give a better review because it is so close. Hopefully the management can get some good servers in there to turn it around."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy this place; however, the food and drinks are horribly inconsistent and for lack of better words, stupidly priced. Build your own burger, pay .50 for lettuce, onion,  or any other veg topping is a bit high considering most places will throw that on for free or a quarter. The build your own salad is an even bigger nickel and dimer. 
I typically go for the  Pittsburgh salad and sometimes it's amazing; other times like today it's disappointing. Today I could count the number of fry pieces on my salad at seven, so basically I got a side salad with leftover fries (obviously they had been under the heat lamp for a while). Now go back to my salad last week and it was spot on with perfect amount of the toppings. In addition to the salad, we got the Buff Chick. Made it wrap, with chicken strips. The menu doesn't state it, but according to Bigham's nickel and dime policy we were charged an additional .50. Not a big deal, it's just annoying that it's not stated and our bartender could've cared less. The wrap itself was the size of a McDonald's snackwrap, so paying an additional .50 on top of the 8.50 for something we could've gotten at McDs or KFC for half the price just added to the annoyance. 
My last order of business is the breakfast shot. The  piece of bacon they give you must have been someone's last bite that they left on their plate. It's not fresh, there's nothing fresh about it. Now, should I be complaining about a free bite of bacon? Normally, I would even say that I'm out of line, so let that be a true idea of how unappetizing it is. 
Will I be back? Yes. My friends seem to enjoy the place, so here's hoping for a brighter Bigham future."}
{"text":"The smokehouse mac is where it's at! Oh, so yummy! Who would have thought that adding some pulled pork, BBQ sauce, and gouda cheese to a bowl of mac n cheese could taste so heavenly?! The portion size is way generous! Two people could easily split one bowl unless someone has an unusually healthy appetite. The hot cheese balls are also pretty solid. We ordered that as our appetizer. Sorry, I was just so excited about the mac n cheese that I just went straight to the good stuff for this review. The hot cheese balls had great flavor! I can't write this review without giving those cheese balls some love. They have a pretty good beer selection and make an awesome Moscow mule! You have to give this place a try! If my picky eater husband can be 100% satisfied, I'm pretty sure you will be too!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Mount Washington for about three years.  Bigham used to be my go to place up here on the Mountain.  They used to have the BEST brunch.  Whenever we would have visitors, Bigham would always be the next morning spot after a night out, to get some awesome brunch.  We even spent New Year's Eve at Bigham and they didn't disappoint. However, my last three visits have me convinced that they are headed in the wrong direction.  The first disappointing visit was during a Pen's game where they had a smaller menu of about five items.  My wife is vegetarian, so we couldn't even get anything she would enjoy.  We turned around a left.  I don't understand how you can have a full menu for New Year's Eve, but not for a Pen's game. Our second visit for was for brunch.  I ordered waffles.  The portion size was decreased dramatically, and the waffles were cold along with the syrup.  I gave it another shot today.  I got the grilled cheese cheeseburger.  I asked for it without tomatoes but the tomatoes were on the burger.  I also asked for a side of ranch, which never came.  And lastly I asked for curly fries, but was given regular fries which were very cold.  I asked for replacement fries, which they did give me, but it took another 7-10 minutes to get them.  At that point I wasn't hungry for them anymore.  The service was great, as Dominique is as good of a server as you can get.  I can't say I'll never be back, but I'm again disappointed with my experience for the third time in a row."}
{"text":"I'm a New Yorker staying in Pittsburgh for the month.

I went to Bigham tavern because someone recommended it to me when I asked about Pittsburgh's best wings. 

I walked in had to seat myself.  Waitress service was extremely slow.  I was from out of town and do not know the menu well, so I ordered the cheap 35 cent wings on wednesday and they had only four sauces listed on the main menu.  Apparrently they had a 2nd menu with many more sauces listed.  So from the main menu I ordered some kind of garlic parmesan wings, which were really really bad.  But I ordered them, so I was stuck with it.

Bottom line: 1. Slow waitress service (Oh and i was there at 530PM, so it wasnt anywhere near packed at the time, so it wasnt like the waitress was swamped),
2. Make sure you ask for the Wing sauce menu.
3. Would not go back"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from my Lyft driver a few months back and finally got the chance to visit.  We (2 people) were there on a weekday night for dinner and the place was packed. We were seated immediately. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful. They were patient when we took good amount of time to place the order since there were so many options with the wing sauces. In fact, they were kind enough to change our wing sauce order too when we decided to go with the popular choice on Yelp Honey habanero garlic sauce. 

We ordered chicken wings with honey habanero garlic sauce and fish tacos served with chips on the side. chicken wings are juicy and unlike my previous experience, the central part of the meat is still juicy and flavorful. The skin is the best part since it soaks up most of the flavor from the sauce. Fish tacos was a pleasant surprise. The lightly fried cod was tasty and one full bite consisting of the fish with other side items was delicious.
 
I recommend trying this place if you are in the area. They serve some good bar type food."}
{"text":"I love this place. I don't live on Mt. Washington but I definately would call this my local watering hole. The food is good and they serve it til 1 am. They are making alot of changes which is great. The outside area is great for the summertime! I love the half priced wine night! Some of the wait staff are not very friendly, there is one girl with brown hair that will make you feel like her life is a living hell... she needs to learn to smile... other than that the staff is amazing"}
