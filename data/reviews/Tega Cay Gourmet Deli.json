{"text":"Walked in Saturday afternoon for lunch, several people preparing dishes but no one spoke or greeted us, or acknowledged us in any way.  Neighbors like this place a lot and rave it about it - couldn't agree.  Hubby ordered Italian Sandwich & I had Cuban Pannini.  I liked the Pannini but Hubby couldn't eat the 2nd half of his sandwich for pulling out the strings from his cold cuts which no one on the line or making his sandwich bothered to do.  I felt punished for asking for a cup for water which was very small (maybe 4-6 oz) I had to refill numerous times.  I don't think we will return,  We didn't feel welcomed at all and I want to feel that way when I spend my hard earned money.  People who love it may be from the North, like the owners.  Next time I'll stick to my normal Saturday lunch spot next door. I don't think they will see me again."}
{"text":"This deli is one of the best things to happen to Fort Mill this past year.  Quick service, reasonable prices, great coffee, and delicious bagels!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood deli and the people are very friendly along with great food."}
{"text":"This place recently opened this week. I have eaten there 2 times already with my mom and 2 small children. We tried many dishes from the hot bar and sanwiches as well. Chicken dishes, rice pilaf, mac and cheese and veggies were excellent. Everything is made in house by a skilled NY cook. They make their own bagels too. This spot is super clean and so adorable inside. Owners were warm and helpful to me and my family. If you like fresh quality yummy food, make a stop!"}
{"text":"Great little deli with fresh salads, breads and sandwiches. I love their everything bagels. Friendly staff and it's always busy there. Minor pitfalls are their short hours the business is open. But then again it's just a breakfast and lunch spot."}
{"text":"First time visit was great.   I got the chopped salad which was delicious.  Atmosphere is very pleasant and service was excellent.  Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Gourmet quality foods! What a surprise to find such a gem in Tega Cay! I will be back and bring my friends. Just excellent!"}
{"text":"Love this place! So happy to have a good deli here finally. Friendly staff. Great food. I'm a regular."}
{"text":"Very good. Staff was very friendly. Food was very tasty. Zero to complain about. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the bacon, egg, cheese bagel breakfast special and was surprised with made from scratch NY style bagels!! I got mine on the egg everything bagel and it was amazing-- also, bacon quality was well above the average breakfast sandwich.  Can't wait to go back and try their lox w/ the works bagel and more!"}
{"text":"Probably the best bagel I've had outside of NY.  Mom and Pop operation.  Friendly staff and great service.  Excellent deli sandwiches."}
{"text":"So fresh and tasty. The salads are amazing and so are the bagels and hashbrowns. I think the only item that wasn't impressive was a pasta salad. They've got a good thing going over there and I'm happy to support a local business."}
{"text":"Breakfast is freshly prepared and any choice of items looked delicious.   Hash browns are cubed with a nice seasoning.....  Try this place.   Definitely  get some bagels to go! Bagels are fresh and numerous options on flavored cream cheeses.   Quick friendly service.  Lots of salad options and sandwiches are filled with excellent high quality meats.   This place is a great addition to Fort Mill."}
{"text":"One of our favorite lunch places.  We usually get some type of panini and have yet to be disappointed.  Sometimes it can be difficult to find a place to sit when it's busy, so that can be annoying."}
{"text":"The food was great. We had no problem finding food to eat, despite having allergies in our party."}
{"text":"I have only heard great things from people who have been here.  Everything is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Just like New York!  Finally a authentic New York deli.  Bagels are a must and prices are right.  Great place to grab brunch or lunch without dealing with a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a bagel or breakfast sandwich. Used to live in the South End neighborhood of Charlotte and this filled the void of Owen's Bagels. Coffee is great, too. Expect a 5 minute wait during peak breakfast times, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"A family staple for us.  We love the omelets, salads, bagels, & cookies are awesome.  The paninis are most likely the best we've ever had as a family.  We love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for a family breakfast once I heard about NY Bagels. Well we were so happy to have our beloved bagels right here in SC. Just moving from LI NY we were missing those perfect bagels. This place totally nails it.   Clean and updated atmosphere, super family friendly. The outdoor seating was nice too, the mornings are still not too hot so we can sit outside.   We will surely be back here for breakfast. I would have uploaded pics but we are everything too fast. :)   YUM GUYS & GALS! Well done."}
{"text":"Love these guys   Bad location, confusing take out - which is majority if you under 65"}
{"text":"Being from New York, i have high expectations for food. This place will not disappoint. Great Bagels, Great Staff. Awesome Owners. So glad your here!!"}
{"text":"I saw this place and instantly thought a northern style deli. Looking at the menu, I noticed that all the \"condiments\" were extra: Cheese, lettuce, onions, pickles, tomato... all extra. So my $6 sandwich ends up being $2 extra when your done with topping it. Ive never heard of a deli place charging you for standard items on a sandwich. My sandwich, plus a side of mac salad and drink was $12. KInda steep. Food was good though, no issues there, and they were doing a good brisk business when I was there. The breakfast items seem priced better, so I may try that."}
{"text":"This place makes it easy to support local business. Great food, great service and great prices. We'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Good deli!  I've had the chopped salad and a few of the prepared salads.  Sandwiches are good too.  My Italian sub was really good but just a tad soggy due to a little too much oil.  Other than that I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Recently visited the Tega Cay Gourmet for breakfast.  While I am not a fan of eating fried eggs on a paper plate,  the food was really good at a fair price.  My wife and I are already looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Kept hearing about this place so finally decided  to give it a try. So glad that I did. I was stuck between giving a 4 and a 5 but after finishing my salad, definitely had to lean towards that 5. Walked in on a Saturday a little before they closed to get a to go order. Chopped salad for myself which was absolutely amazing. I had them mix my lettuce, so I got a mix of spinach, spring lettuce and romaine and added avocado, mushrooms, carrots, feta cheese and ranch dressing. They chopped it up for me and I'm here to tell you it was banging!!! I ordered my husband an Italian sandwich and asked for it to be on white bread instead of a sub roll. I also asked for no tomatoes or red peppers. Well I got home and it was on a sub roll instead of the white bread. And then they still added the red peppers. Not a big deal, I pulled the peppers off for him and he said it was good, he just obviously wished it was on the white bread like I asked and then wished it had more romaine lettuce on it. It had one teeny tiny piece of lettuce on it. Lastly, I got a pound of egg salad for a friend. It was good! I contemplated maybe keeping it for myself. I love how they have homemade pasta salads and such that they sell by the pound. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Finally good NY bagels in Lake Wylie!  Don't fool around with any other place.  Fresh hot bagels made on site!  Boars Head meats.  Bacon, egg and cheese on a roll.  Deli style sandwiches!  They have it all.  You need to try this place!!!!"}
{"text":"As close to a NY/NJ deli as you will get in South Carolina.  Great food and good prices.  This is my new favorite lunch spot on Ft Mill"}
{"text":"Awesome.    Great lox and bagel!  Very nice staff - very attentive.   This place is a WINNER."}
{"text":"My fav breakfast spot in Tega Cay.  Kinda reminds me of the delis from back home in NYC"}
{"text":"First visit for lunch today,carry out. Great sandwich (the Italian), with a side of egg salad. Friendly staff.Now that my office has moved down the street they will see me again."}
{"text":"This place is THE best place to go for a fresh bagel. Other places claim theirs are fresh, but this place actually makes the bagels on premises.  I hope they keep doing what they are doing!  Great atmosphere too!!"}
{"text":"Awesome homemade bagels and a variety of salads made fresh every morning. Boar's Head meats and cheeses. Staff are amazingly friendly and helpful. Definitely a fine addition to Tega Cay!"}
{"text":"This place is great, greeted with smiling faces, the staff is friendly and fast. The food is awesome, the select of bagels that are fresh and pastries are plentiful. I have a family of picky eaters and the menu selections they have has something for everyone My choice is the omelet and home fries"}
{"text":"We absolutely love TegaCay Deli, nothing fancy just good food. We go at least once a week if not more, every Saturday morning my 4 yr old son wakes up and wants to go to the deli for breakfast sandwiches. Bagels are great, breakfast is good, salads and sandwiches are good. Have never had anything bad here and seriously I'm there at least once a week. We have eaten there twice in one day!"}
{"text":"TC Deli has the best bagels I've had since living in South Florida.  This has become our quick, go to breakfast place.  However, the chopped salads are amazing for lunch, too!"}
{"text":"Have been many times and enjoyed each and every item. Salads especially their chopped salad, bagels, rolls, eggs, fried potatoes and everything in between. The crumb cake \"is to die for\".  Friendly service and good food. Fort Mill and Tega Cay are lucky indeed!"}
{"text":"Our go to neighborhood place for breakfast. The owners are great and the food is even better! You can't go wrong with a bagel sandwich and coffee, and don't under estimate the deli items. They're awesome, too!"}
{"text":"excellent breakfast, sandwiches and salads.....especially love the loaded bagel/ lox breakfast sandwich, great staff, easy to find location....wish they had more hours!"}
{"text":"If you are from New York, you will understand my ratings. I found this place on accident as we planned to go the restaurant next door. The one thing that caught my attention was the hours on the door. They are open from 7am-3pm. Then when we walked in to check it out, they have a case will the desserts that took me back to my childhood....specifically the cookies with the jelly filling. Needless to say, we stayed and ordered a Reuben with corned beef and a Reuben with pastrami. We ordered two sides, the macaroni salad and the Italian pasta salad. The Italian pasta salad had cheese and salami in it. I felt like I was back at a Jewish deli like when I grew up. We ordered bagels to go and a few sides. We will definitely be making more visits here. This place is everything."}
{"text":"Tega Cay Gourmet Deli is located in Tega Cay, SC (near the Walmart Supercenter).  My manager (from work) has been raving about their breakfast rolls.    I ordered Ham, Egg, and Cheese on a roll (with an extra egg).  YUM!!  Exactly as my manager mentioned, the rolls were delicious!  It did remind me of the breakfast sandwiches / rolls that my significant other and I used to get in New York City!    ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Tried them out this morning and was very satisfied.  Had a sausage, egg and cheese sesame bagel.  The bagel was great, chewy not tough like some.  The entire bagel was covered with sesame seeds not just the \"top\".  Tasted fresh.  They have plain and flavored coffees in pump urns so you can choose what you want.  The only reason they didn't get 5 stars from me is the cheese was a slice of American and I think a bagel this good should be paired with real cheese and because the bagel was barely toasted.  Those nit picky issues didn't stop me from buying a half dozen to go.  Oh and the prices are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"Finally a place to buy a fresh chopped salad. I'd probably be here every day if I worked hereby. Will become a weekend regular. Great fresh bagels too."}
{"text":"Bagels and sandwich ingredients = Bagels Sandwiches  My wife and I ate here for breakfast and she ordered a Bacon Egg Cheese on a bagel and I ordered the same, but on a roll.  Hers was better, get the bagel if you go.  Overall the taste was a bit on the bland side, both seemed to be missing a little something, although we could not put out finger on what it was missing.  The decor is kinda plain, and looks a bit unfinished. But that didn't take away from the experience.  The prices were very reasonable.  I will be going back.  I teetered between a 3 and a 4, becuase of the plain flavor. I went with 4 stars because the food was good overall, the service quick, and the prices were so reasonable."}
{"text":"Over the past year this place has become a staple for our family. We couldn't possibly love the food, people or coffee any more than we do!!!"}
{"text":"Great place,  food is real good as far as the sandwiches go and the bagels and breakfast.   Finally a good place to get egg sandwiches."}
{"text":"A New Yorker and an egg sandwich is a love affair. It's the    one thing we miss the most and now it's here! They also have great coffee, chopped salads and sandwiches and bagels. At the front when you pay they have homemade crumb cake and desserts. It's always packed so call ahead to order if your picking up . You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Taylor ham, egg and cheese on the freshest everything bagel! Staff was very pleasant. Quick service. Will be back! Great food!"}
{"text":"When I walked into the deli I got a huge smile on my face, because I recognized the owner from another bagel shop in Charlotte. My husband and I are from New York and have tried out every bagel shop in town. This deli is truly a New York deli, and will not disappoint. So glad they are open in Tega Cay!"}
{"text":"Appreciate having a local \"Deli\" offering various regional foods!  Support local business owners!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich and bagels ive had since moving from NY! Fresh authentic and delicious-  not too heavy or doughy, the bacon crisp and high-quality and made to order eggs.   Quick, efficient and pleasant service.  The $3.99 special is a steal- bacon egg and cheese on a roll/bagel and a coffee!!  Also other yummy ny faves like taylor ham, strawberry creamcheese and buttery crumbcake!! Definitely recommend trying!"}
{"text":"I'm here for the 3rd day in a row. Very excited this place is here  one thing the South lacks is good delis and this is it.   I do not consider Jason's deli or any big chains like that legit good delis. This is a good legit deli. If you are from up North you will love it..  food and service are great  15 minute drive and I'm happy to make it."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Delicious!!! Delicious!!!  We got ours to go because there was no tables available; but, it was super yummy even as to go!   They advertise the bagels are made fresh every day! I could not decide between the corn beef or pastrami. We I  went half with my hubby.   The food:  Ruben (w/corn beef)- hubby favorite  Ruben's brother (w/pastrami)- my favorite; because it's juicer and saltier!   Overall, I was glad I got half of each; because they were, so packed with meat.  By the end of 1 half of a sandwich, I was glad I had a different meat.   Kids got:  Plain bagel with grape jelly- ate the whole bagel!  Asiago bagel with cream cheese- too big for the younger kid; but she really enjoyed it.   The bagel were toasted and perfect! - definitely fresh and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The food is always great and the prices are just as fantastic.  The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star is how small it is.  It's always crowded with nearly no where to stand or sit.  I have gone elsewhere several times because of the crowds on weekends.  Maybe they will be able to get a larger space nearby sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, and reasonably priced good food.  Can't ask,for much more.  Plus they have Taylor Ham sandwiches."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. I had the Santa Fe and my wife had a cold sub. Quality was great and had a big selection to choose from."}
{"text":"This place is okay... just a basic breakfast. Anything you get here you can do at your own house. I got a bacon egg and cheese on toast and it wasn't hot cheese wasn't even melted. Been here 3 or 4 times and service is just slow for breakfast/ bagel place."}
{"text":"Authentic New England-style deli with great  service and very high quality food.  Sandwiches, hot meals and homemade salads. This was a much-needed niche that has finally been filled. Deli meats are Boars Head, which is SOOOO much better than what you find at the local Subway. No mystery meats here. Just full-packed sandwiches at a fair price.  Very happy to frequent Tega Cay Gourmet Deli."}
{"text":"Best Deli around! Only negative thing i can think of is they close @3pm. Which i Guess isn't bad for them."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and it was a solid choice. We had a chicken salad sandwich, a crispy chicken sandwich, and one of the house specialty sandwiches. For sides, we had potato salad and cucumber salad.  Everything was fresh and good. I would definitely go here over a chain sandwich place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The bagel breakfast sandwiches are simply the best. One day I plan to try them for lunch but for now I'll share my enthusiasm for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. I get it on the egg bagel as a combo with a cup of coffee which rings up to a little under $5. I'd be in serious trouble if this was on my way to work instead of the opposite direction.   The owners are very friendly and service is always so quick. The pump your own coffee comes in a variety of flavors and is always hot and fresh. The price is good for the quality of the breakfast and the atmosphere is very inviting. This is a stop worth making!"}
{"text":"1st visit, the sandwich was fresh but way over priced especially since there was not a lot of meat on sandwich and no chips or drink is offered with expensive turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"I was heading next door and noticed this little deli so decided at the last minute to go inside to get a bagel and a drink.  It's clearly a favorite spot because it was full of people, which made it ultra confusing for someone that's never been inside.  There were no signs and the employees weren't wearing uniforms or name tags so I really couldn't tell who worked there or where to place my order.  There seemed to be too many people behind the counter that all did different functions.  I finally placed my order and realized the only drinks were bottles (sigh) so I made myself as small as possible amongst the other people waiting in the very small space and hoped they'd call my name soon.    Business is obviously good for the deli, but I don't do well in such tight spaces with so many people... certainly not worth all this for a simple bagel.  I'm glad business is good for them, but I will not be back."}
{"text":"I've contemplated coming here for awhile now, and  glad I finally went! Prices are perfect! 1/2 dozen bagels for $6! Can't beat that price, or the taste!!! These bagels remind me of NY (no not the city). I bought one of each: salt bagel, everything egg, cinnamon/sugar, Asiago cheese, jalapeño, and a plain bagel. So far I've tried the everything, cinnamon, and Asiago cheese. They're all fabulous!! I was a bit overwhelmed when I first walked in as there was no rhyme or reason as to where to go. However, once one worker was freed up she came right over to take my order. Soon as she finished bagging my bagels I was off to the register. I can't wait to go back and try breakfast or lunch. I will now buy my bagels from her as well."}
{"text":"Who's NY bagels are these? Living in NYC for 40 years I can tell you this is not a NY bagel. These are skinny little pathetic bagels. Let's say it's the water. The word Deli is from NY but this deli does not compare to a real NY deli. Place is clean but unfortunately everything I have had lacked luster. I really wanted to love this place but it fell short of my expectations. In comparison to NY deli portion sizes seem small , sandwich bread is bland, home fries were lacking flavor.Maybe a trip to the 5 boroughs could kick it up a notch.  Bottom line if your from the boroughs and know your deli this won't cut it. Just go in expecting less than I did and you'll be ok.They do carry boars head which is a plus but so does Harris teeter ."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times. Their breakfast special is great. The service is excellent and always with a smile.  You'll be glad you stoped.  Tom"}
{"text":"We love this place.  We get a good meal at a treasonable price.  The staff is friendly.  There is a steady stream of people frequenting this establishment.   We highly recommend Tega Cay Gourmet Deli."}
{"text":"I live 5 minutes from this place and just stumbled on it as I was getting a tire repaired on our van. What a gem. Staff is friendly, food is fresh and delicious. A much better alternative to the typical fast food places and I love supporting local businesses. I will definitely be coming back and bringing my family too!"}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting this location. I had the Tega Cay omelette with ham onions and cheddar and I thought I'd add a bagel with cream cheese just to check out their bagels. Overall for a breakfast Deli not a bad selection however it was not my favorite breakfast. I'll file this under a potential maybe for my next Deli outing."}
{"text":"I have reviewed the Tega Cay Deli in the past and it was great! The past two times I have been there the service has been unbelievably slow. both times were Saturday mornings. I do not have a problem at all with the food but it shouldn't take 20-25 minutes to get an egg sandwich. I understand they are busy but I work 12 hour days during the week and every minute of my weekends are important. When I finally asked about it they said there was another order ahead of me. Hopefully they are no making one order at a time. I was late two weekends in a row for events because it wasn't a quick breakfast to go. I am writing this update so others can be warned if you don't get there VERY EARLY make sure have plenty of time to wait."}
{"text":"I am from NYC and I was at home as soon as walked in. It looked right, it smelled right, it felt right and if you are from NYC then you know what I mean. The owners are from NYC. They make the bagels and all of the salads. The rye bread was great. It had just the right favor and texture. My friend and I shared a rueben, a Rueben's brother, macaroni salad, pasta salad and coffee cake. I also had a cold brewed iced coffee. All I can say is that it was REAL coffee. I took home bagels and chicken salad. They were all great. The bagels are best I have had in the south. Everyday I wish I were closer to this deli.  I almost left out the pickle. It was to die for."}
{"text":"Ay, Oh!! This place is as close to New York as you get. The lines are long but it goes quick! I was talking to the owner and he's from where I come from in New York.I got the special of baconeggancheeseonnaroll!! It came with coffee, which btw was Delish!  That was only 3.99! Great deal, great people. You order at the counter, pay at the register and wait for your name to be called. They also have Italian cookies and salads and shit. I love this place."}
{"text":"Best New York deli food here in Tega Cay!  So glad they are here, bagels are fantastic! Deli sandwiches love them!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Small but wonderful food. A bit pricey but food is great! Love coming here whenever I can! Limited hours so get here early!"}
{"text":"Being from NY,  I'm a deli snub. Finally, I found a \"real\" deli.  Delicious egg sandwich - actually cooked on the grill not in a microwave.  An actual square Kanish w hot mustard. Omg- delish!! Rainbow cookies & chocolate lace cookies taste like I was back home in NY.  Thank you!!!!! Will be back again and again.   Suzy (originally Fr the BX)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. The food is really good. It's a nice spot if you have some time to kill. If you're visiting I wouldn't say you need to go out of your way. Side note, the coffee is one of the best in town."}
{"text":"What else can I say except this deli is amazing!!! Literally the best everything bagel I ever had. My fiance and I go here for pork roll sandwichs every once in a while. They also have the most delicious and huge crumb cake slices I've ever seen. A cute place with lots of locals who know where  the good food is!!"}
{"text":"I love the Tega Cay Deli! I work next to them, and I frequently go for my lunch. I love the owners, they are the nicest people! They have great food! Love their sandwiches! I will say it's a little on the pricier side for lunch items like sandwiches and salads, but over all I love it. Line is long during lunch time, and the place is pretty small inside, I wasn't able to sit inside because there was no room, but they do have outdoor seating, it was a little to cold to sit out there today so I just got it to go. But a great place overall, totally 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why there are so many great reviews.   We ate there ordering two sandwiches; a Rueben and a Pastrami on Rye.   The ingredients were fine and they were hot when they brought them out.   The problem is the bread was soaked in greasy butter. Literally dripping from the bread.   Not toasty as it should have been but soaking in grease.   Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Breakfast and lunch are excellent! Salads  are fresh and delicious!  I had them cater for me for Christmas party and it came out great . Food was fantastic and presented well.  I defiantly ordered enough food but my guest could not stop eating . Ran out of sandwiches and had a little salad left over . I was disappointed because I wanted to pig out the next day . The staff at Tega Cay Deli are great.  Definitely will continue to eat there and get catering from them as well !"}
{"text":"Being from New York, I am thrilled to find a New York style deli here in South Carolina! I had the \"Lox with the Worx\" on a asiago cheese bagel, toasted. My mouth is still celebrating! Had to take half in a take out box because the portions were so generous. Where else are you going to Dina bagel with smoked salmon, red onions, tomatoes, CAPERS, and cream cheese. This place is friendly, clean, convenient, and oh so amazing w their bagels. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great breakfast and lunch spot. Awesome people and awesome food. The smoked salmon bagel, cranberry chicken salad, tuna salad are just a few if my favorites. I go for lunch often and my husband and I had breakfast there today. People were pouring in!"}
