{"text":"Great name, great chips. Fish is not the best in town, but well worth a visit"}
{"text":"Very good fish and chips served here, one of the best in Scarborough in my opinion. Large selection of fish on offer (I first tried shark here)    Being on the seafront it can get very busy in the season and on weekends. The prices are average for Scarborough.    The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I don't like fish and chips!! so I usually opt for lots and chips and sauce, but I went with my Partner and daughter who LOVE fish and chips and they were extremely impressed!    Winking Willies is on the south side of Scarborough on the seafront, so it's handy to pop in and have a meal if you're having a day out at the seaside! They also have a takeaway if you prefer to take your lunch to the beach, but when you've got a tot in tow I aways find it easier to find somewhere with a highchair - which the staff at Winking Willies were happy to provide.    My daughter chose fish bites and chips and it was served in a little paper boat - so sweet. The food was piping how ('blow it mummy blow!!) and the fish was almost glowing white so I was sure that it was extremely fresh. By all accounts it tasted good as there was nothing left! My only criticism is that they only offered fizzy pop or milk to drink and my daughter isn't allowed pop and tends not to drink milk during the day.    My partner decided to try skate wings and he was in heaven! he thoroughly recommends them and even had me, non fish eating me! try some - and honestly, not too bad at all!!"}
{"text":"Winking Willie's is excellent - we have had both cod and haddock from here, and it is always freshly cooked, and the chips are always very good too. It does get busy in season but the queues are well worth it - the food is superb!    They use local food too, unlike some other places in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"I don't enjoy giving poor reviews but this food was just not good. The chips weren't fresh! The mushy peas were bland...especially bad as I as starving when arrived and so looking forward to chips by the seaside."}
{"text":"Fish and chips are a matter of local pride. Everyone knows that *their* local chippy is the best, and will happily fight all comers with knives and bottles should they disagree.  But there is also a deep divide on the subject of whether fish and chips are better inland than they are at the seaside. Defenders of the coast will point to the undeniable freshness of the fish. Those who prefer the inland view often baulk at the coastal practice of leaving the skin on the fish and the often inferior quality of the chips.  I'm a switch-hitter on the issue - and Winking Willies has been on my 'best of' list since I was knee-high to Vern Troyer.  Serving hot, fresh chips - fluffy on the inside but with a surprising crunch on the outside (most chippy chips being invariably soggy with fat) - and pristine, flakey white fish - Winking Willies always delivers.  Get them to take away, and eat them straight from the paper while overlooking the harbour to get the essence of the East coast distilled into 3000 hot, greasy calories. Yum!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Winking Wilies? Cheap and cheerful come to mind but there was nothing cheerful about it the last time I visited.   After a debate with the girls over what side order to choose (obviously has to be mushy peas girls!) we gave our order to the grumpy waiter (we ate in) who sloped off and came back 15 minutes later with our orders.   The food was nothing to write home about and the peas...oh Lord the peas....I would not force feed them to my worst enemy.   I have to say though, any other time I've visited here I've been to the take-out side and enjoyed my lunch enormously. How could it be that the take-away is better than the restaurant option?  Up the game Willies, you talk the talk but need to walk the walk a lttle better."}
{"text":"Food OK, not amazing. Atmosphere a bit dull, no music. Prices not too bad, Â£20 for large fish/chips and mushy peas for two."}
