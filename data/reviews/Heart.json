{"text":"Their gelato was perfect! I had peach and like and loved it!!!! Especially the peach flavour it was just amazing. 

Also ordered a white chocolate mousse cup ($5.20) to share with my friend. It looked really pretty, that's what tricked me into ordering it but regretted later. It was horrible! The mousse wasn't creamy at all, it was so stiff. Me and my friend barely ate half and left the rest there untouched. Will return for gelato if I am in the area but definitely won't order the white chocolate mousse cup again!"}
{"text":"This is easily the finest desert spot in BWV.  Exceptional Gelato.  Great coffee. Friendly and helpful staff. They do great Gelato take out too. Remember this place the next time you offer to \"bring dessert\" for a dinner party."}
{"text":"Great coffee, casual and comfortable ambience, friendly atmosphere very clean amenities, delicious cake selection, so-so crepes, service a little slow."}
{"text":"Love this place! This place is so different; it is more European. I can't wait to go there again for coffee and treats. The price was surprisingly fair. It is a great place to spend time with a friend."}
{"text":"Watery bitter latte. Desserts tasted like they were from a grocery store, not store made. Better gelato can be had elsewhere. Spend your money at the many other dessert and coffee shops in the area."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and wish i had read the reviews before eating here!! Like the other reviews mentioned my crepe was WARM and was hardly stuffed with chicken. There was absolutely no flavour and the texture was quite odd.

The only good thing here was the variety of gelato (quite good) and cakes (have not tried.. don't know if i'd want to).

If I ever come back it will be for 2 reasons: 1. I was in the neighbourhood and craved gelato, 2. I want to give their cakes a try.

2 thumbs down for me."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for dessert and gelato and my overall experience was just okay. The interior of the place is very nice, specious, modern, nice soft chairs, a few window seats but when we walked it, we were a bit confused with different vibes that were going on. Initially, I thought it was a dessert place, but after walking in it felt more of a Latin club.  They were playing loud music, a few couples were dancing salsa, while some were just having a coffee. I felt that the music was just so loud for a dessert place like this.  I may have come on one of their special events but it really didn't go with the rest of the place. 
What threw me off right away is that, as we walked in, one of the staff members told us that we can only do take out, as they are closing in 25 mins. What kind of customer service is that?! After we ensured him that we wouldn't stay too long, he eventually allowed to stay in and we were able to get great seat right by the window.  We eventually placed our order (gelato and cake), which was brought to our table by one of the owners.  I ordered a slice 'Capri' (vanilla, strawberry) cake and my sister had a bowl of gelato. The price for one small slice of cake is $6.99, which I found quite pricey.   The gelato was quite good, tasty but not spectacular. They do have a great selection of desserts, mostly European cakes, which makes the place a bit different from a lot of other cafes in the city.  Overall, it's an okay spot for grabbing a coffee, but next time, I would definitely come at a different time (during the day), when they are hopefully not playing such loud music and I don't feel like I am in a club while trying to enjoy my dessert."}
{"text":"We decided to go and try a crepe here again as we had good success before...so we decided to try the black forest cake crepe...it was the first time for the new staff server making it so not the perfect crepe but ok...but instead of the sour cherries listed on the menu it had maraschino cherries....yuk....when checking out we mentioned this to the male staff member at check out and his response was ooops must have grabbed the wrong ones....not impressed...."}
{"text":"I've been twice this week because their specials caught my eye. It's easy to find desserts in Bloor West but their gelato is exceptional. There's a good variety of cakes and ice cream plates, and even booze. There's not much in the way of food, but they do have a \"savoury\" menu with some decent little snacks (the phyllo spinach plate is a bit soggy but I still like it). 

What's really exceptional about this place is the quality of the desserts (all made fresh on site) combined with the incredible value - we had snacks and dessert with a beer for $15 earlier this week. It's unheard of in this area. I hope they can keep the prices as they are! 

Friendly service and a clean, brand new and interesting decor. My new fav in Bloor West!"}
{"text":"The decor is pretty, but the hearts that decorate the place are dollar store valentines leftovers. Tacky... They played horrible clubby music that did not fit with the theme at all. Not romantic! Chrystal chandeliers, and dub dub dub. Hmm... 

They have a page in their menu that features flavoured hot chocolate; we were only told when we were ready to order that they didn't actually have any of the flavours. 

The menu listed all their cakes, but just gave a photo and the name of the cake. It didn't actually have a description of what it was. You had to go to the cooler to see the description, which isn't a biggie, but it was a little odd. Some of he cakes in the cooler weren't on the menus and vice versa. 

I ordered a latte which came with a little gingerbread cookie. The latte was perfect. My friend had some herbal tea. It was served beautifully with a plate on top of the mug that held a little container of honey, the spoon, and a cookie. 

Despite the variety of different cakes, they were mostly just some nut/chocolate variation, which is a shame given that many people have allergies, like myself. We ordered a slice of the Anna cake which was similar to a flourless chocolate cake without the density. It was okay; I was expecting the darker chocolate to have more of a punch. The serving was pretty small given the price ($5.99).

If I were in the area, I would go again. It's the only dessert dedicated place in the area.


Edited to add: they serve coffee and tea with a tasty little ginger snap cookie. I was at Costco today, an what did I find? The cookies!!! They definitely are NOT made in house, which is ironic, considering its a BAKERY."}
{"text":"The last time I went to a dessert place the dessert I was given had fuzzy mould growing in it.

Glad to say that Heart is full of heart!!  Strawberry shortcake and Victoria cake we had were fresh and delicious.  Nice large assortment of cakes and a small selection of gelato as well.  

We ordered our desserts and they gave them to us and brought our drinks to our table.  Nice decor, open and allows you t have a conversation without shouting which is why we left Bloom across the street rather than have dessert there.

Service is friendly too!"}
{"text":"The crepes we ordered came lukewarm. I would expect the freshly made crepe to be warm or hot when it arrives. The coffee served was room temperature as well. Kind of odd. Good service and the tea is tasty but overall disappointed with the quality of food.

Edit: There is a fly catcher above the sitting area. Not really sure if this is normal. I've never seen this at a restaurant and made me a bit sick to my stomach"}
{"text":"Avoid.  Had the \"heart cake\" on the advice of the staff, and ended up throwing it in the garbage after a few bites.  It was flavourless and uninspired.  Its hard to screw up desert but they did it.  The servings are very small.  I'll be surprised if this place isnt out of business in less than a year.  As a neighbourhood resident I hope the owner starts to care at least a little bit about this business, or heart goes out of business and makes space for a business owner that serves the neighbourhood well."}
{"text":"My little sister and I were passing by when we came across this place and decided to check it out. 

The place is so spacious and really quiet. Even for a Friday night. You walk in and you have the choice to stay or order to go. They have many interesting and amazing tastes in gelatos. They also have beautiful cakes and mousses.  Their menu offers very thing from simple salads to amazingly beautiful and yummy desserts.

The servers are very friendly and knowledgable. Since everything is made in house, getting answers to health and allergy related questions are a breeze. Just ask the servers. Id recommend this place to anyone interested in casual conversation over desserts."}
{"text":"Super cute place and good black tea (the Paris one) and the bacon crepe is good. One of the planks is ok it's kinda small but tastes fine. The part that wasn't good was I ordered a chocolate strawberry crepe and it came with Nutella. I thought it was a mistake so I asked but they said chocolate means Nutella. But on the menu there are other crepes with Nutella listed as an ingredient so this makes no sense (and other crepes have chocolate in the ingredients too...are those Nutella?) So I returned it."}
