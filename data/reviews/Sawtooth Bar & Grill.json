{"text":"Nice fun small place to grab a quick beer! Food is good and staff is nice  Great karaoke !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! First time here, heard the owner is super cool and Bria our bartender was fantastic! Just moved here from Iowa and absolutely love the friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  Service is horrible, blond bartender does nothing at all but sit there.  No Service at all!!  The food was expensive!!!  $12 for a small order of SALAD??  The music was on and you couldn't even hear yourself think.  This has got to be the worst experience I've ever had.  I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is amazing! Will definitely be back.... Megan and Shelley kept the vibe fun, would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Shelly is a cool as f@(/  and her bar is the perfect place to eat, drink and feel totally at home. We've been searching for a neighborhood bar for over a year. Found it! Food is great, service is friendly and beer is cold."}
{"text":"The best service in town! Atmospheres awesome and the food is fabulous.  Alicia is the greatest! Karaoke is a blast!!"}
{"text":"Just finished an amazing afternoon lunch at Fuller's!  This place is great for both lunch and dinner. Oh and karaoke at night is fun to listen to. The most impressive part today was how hard Krysten was working from the time we walked in the door. From cleaning, prepping, to serving she was amazing!  Made us feel very welcome and like we were special. Thanks Krysten for a mother great Fuller's experience!"}
{"text":"I am new to the neighborhood and the staff was amazing!!! You will feel right at home!!! Very welcoming and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Rude host, slow service even though no one was there, a gruesome hunting show on the TV while I was eating!!"}
{"text":"The owner Shelly is awesome! This is definitely a sports bar. I know that some bars have their favorite sports teams..this is definitely a (Colorado) state oriented bar. Karaoke is great here..usually Chelsea is hosting the festivities. My favorite thing about this bar is the chicken tenders! Best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Great bar.  It has lots  of TVs with sports on. Try the tater tots they are great!"}
{"text":"Shelly orchestrated some mean karaoke.  What would this place be without her?? She also has a keen eye for bartending talent...Alicia is a beautiful friendly bartender.  Together, they will make your night unforgettable!"}
{"text":"Such great service from all staff specially Shelly # 1 Long Islands,  best French Dip and awesome karaoke."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from where I live. It's a cool local bar. Broncos fans are welcome! They have really good wings and burgers. I will frequent throughout the football season."}
{"text":"Yes to Fuller's.   Fun and friendly!  There are many neighborhood bars but none give you a feeling like your home away from home like Fullers does.  Food is good, drinks are cold and affordable and Shelley and Chris do a great job making sure you unwind from a long day at work.  Karaoke on most nights I've been there....surprisingly there have been a lot of great singers!   I have taken a lot of friends here and they always walk away wishing they live closer....hello UBER!!!"}
{"text":"We took our grandsons for lunch and they loved it. Now they ask to go when they come over. The staff was very friendly and had some great recommendations for our very picky eaters. The burgers and chicken tenders were a big hit. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"What a nice little neighborhood bar. Small, cozy yet plenty of seating. Food was tremendous and unique. The beer was cheap and the food was reasonable. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good sports bar, was there and all the screens were on, if you love vodka they carry quite a number of different ones. Food was great and arrived quickly and was exactly as ordered. Nice space, DOES have a patio/outside tables. Do not understand how one winner says 'Avoid at all costs!  New owners suck!' without saying why, classic trolling. This is not a hipsters or foo foo bar people so the uppity ones can go to Scottsdale and over pay there."}
{"text":"Such a great place!  Management and staff are friendly and professional and FUN!  The drinks are a good pour and they have some really fun \"Umbrella\" drinks to try. Karaoke there is a blast, with singers ranging from Amateur to \"why aren't they signed by a label?\" The food is really, really good!  The best wings and burgers around and their homemade chips....BOMB! I love going here and there are many, many regulars and most every newcomer becomes a regular!  BTW, the owner Shelley...she ROCKS.  One hard-working lady!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a dull moment at Fullers. Best bar food in town! When you order a drink, you get a DRINK trust me. I don't sing but love going here for karaoke because the people that sing can ACTUALLY sing! The owner Shelly is very friendly and and the prices are reasonable. I love asking for a \"surprise\" drink...she can make the coolest drinks I've ever seen. Great, service, great people, fun place to hang if you want to be at a bar and not a club!"}
{"text":"Okay so unexpected!!! Fabulous bartender. Ordered the grilled Chicken tenders with fried mushrooms, nothing premade or frozen. Sauces absolutely amazing. Best fried mushrooms I've had. Bartender fab. Excellent find. No cons"}
{"text":"Awesome Place! Our go-to place for a drink and great food. Owner is awesome and super friendly and welcoming. I have tried many things on the menu and they have all been great. Nice sports bar with high quality TV's with many games."}
{"text":"This is the best sports bar and grill in Chandler.  Food is fantastic.  Try the Captain Crunch chicken strips.  DELICIOUS!!  Fried mushrooms to die for.  Nachos are huge and the best!  People are friendly and nice positive vibe.  Shelly runs a great bar and her staff are outstanding also.  Jesse the cook delivers you the best food. It's like CHEERS on tv.  Everyone knows your name if you are a regular and if you are new they welcome you with open arms.  I can't think of anything negative about Fullers.  It has become our place to go for a drink and a bite to eat!!!  I recommend Fullers to everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place and found this one on......wait for it.......Yelp! The reviews seemed good, the menu look good, so we went.  I like the way the place looks.  Bar signs and neon provide most of the light and there are several ceiling fans to keep the place cool.  The waitress/bartender was extremely nice (I am so sorry I can't remember her name) and helpful.  To start we ordered a couple of beers and some fried pickles.  I have to say that these were the best fried pickles I have had.  The pickle slices were breaded and seasoned perfectly.  They were not greasy at all, except the last 3 we left in the bottom of the basket (sacrifice to the fried pickle God).  My wife, who is not much of a fried pickle fan, even said they were delicious.  I ordered the special of the day which was 18 wings for $12.99.  The wings were good size and very meaty and I am guessing by the time it took to get them, they were cooked to order, not cooked half way and then finished when you order them which is a huge bonus with me.  I would rather wait 30 minutes for fresh wings than 10 for warmed up wings.  I consider myself a wing coinsure...lol....because it is usually all I ever order,  I ordered them in Hot and Mango Habanero.  This is where the debate between my wife and myself began.  The first wing I tried was the hot.  The first thing that I tasted was tomato juice and I can not stand tomato juice.  It is kind of like a person that hates onions and can taste an onion sliver in a 5 gallon bucket of salsa.  The hot quickly killed the taste so I tried another, same thing, tomato juice.  My wife said that she tasted tomato sauce and not juice (yes there is a difference).  I repeatedly said that it was tomato juice.  The Mango Habanero were very good.  They could have been a little hotter but they were still very good, my wife loved them.  She had the loaded baked potato.  Piled with butter, sour cream, bacon bits and cheese (maybe something else, I can't remember).  She really liked it.  We will go back, I will get wings again, just not the hot."}
{"text":"So loving this place.  Best atmosphere,  service. Super cool owner. Enjoyed the whole experience here on Friday night with griends."}
{"text":"Great local bar with quality food and service. We walk to this neighborhood bar to watch all our favorite sporting events and when we're in the mood for some of the best karaoke singers in Chandler. If you're a fan of football, basketball or any other sport then you will appreciate the number of TVs that allow you to view multiple games at once.  They're great about changing the channel if you're looking for a specific game.  The food is delicious - the chicken nachos are my favorite; they are served with homemade salsa that is tasty and not too spicy.  The portion sizes are big.  My husband loves their burgers that are made to order.  They also serve savory wings that are available in a variety of flavors.  Our favorite is the traditional medium -  we always request them to be extra saucy and they always accommodate.  They open early on Sunday for football games.  Good service and good value on drinks especially during happy hour.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"There's plenty of room. Karaoke on Thursday nights is friendly and open. And, no matter what day of the week the beer and wings are excellent. On top of all the great food and fun, the service has never disappointed me in the past couple years under the new ownership."}
{"text":"I'm honestly I was hoping for more... I had a Moscow mule which was eh, not fizzy like usual which was odd and lacking in a ginger essence...hubby had a beer... The karaoke was ok...i wonder if it is all the time though coz it was overly loud for such a small space. Everyone seemed to know one another and it seemed more cliquey...like high school. We hired for more since change of owbership/name...  2 stars for cleanliness and lighting! Way better than the place before. I think the new owner is the same bar tender who was there when it was still the darkhorse...shelly...she is very nice"}
{"text":"Fuller's is one one of my favorite local spots in Chandler! I love coming here for their $3 Four Peaks Brews specials on Saturday. I am also a HUGE fan of their beer battered (hop knot) fish n chips! This stuff is great! They also have great Karaoke.. The staff and owners are great and give good service. Beer buckets only $10 and you can bring back \"beer chips\" that you don't use!"}
{"text":"Terrific, attentive staff, cold beer and great eats!  Great mix of people!  Come on in and feel right at home.  Fun place catch a game too!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Sawtooth is the place. The wings were dynamite. They even grilled them perfectly. The draft beers on tap I was quite impressed with they had Bells IPA, and 805 two of my favorites. The bartender was fun, joking and recommended the wings grilled and to try a new beer the Bells Oberon it was top notch."}
{"text":"Came here one night for a few beers and just to check it out. Place itself is pretty small - kinda weird shaped bar with a few seats here and there around it. There are also a bunch of tables filling up the rest of the bar. Atmosphere is homey, neighborhood bar kind of feel. A friend and I had a few Longboard pints as we spoke of this, that, and the other thing. On the way to the bathroom there's one of them Internet Jukeboxes/TouchTunes thingies on the wall. Men's bathroom has a swinging saloon door to get to the stall. Place wasn't crowded at all so we just drank and chilled. Then all of a sudden there was karaoke going on. Funny thing about this place is we witnessed three levels of karaoke that night. Your lowest level was made up of folks that never sang in school or church or whatever and just figured they could sing because they had a coupla more pints than usual and what the hey - I'm Elvis/Sinatra/Johnny Cash rolled into one! Those folks would be trying to stay on time with the words on the screen and trying to hit all the notes like they were playing some rigged Whack-A-Mole game at the county fair after being suckered by some unscrupulous carny. Pretty much a trainwreck most times - some even made familiar tunes completely unrecognizeable - which takes some genius level atonal compositional skills. Then there were the regular folks that could more or less sing at an amateur level and could carry the tune even if they missed a note here and there - the kind of folks you usually expect at karaoke places. But there were two folks at a third level. I can only describe it as OMGWTF. It was like some professional singers came into to practice a bunch of songs they happened to have on karaoke as a warm-up before either going into the studio or on tour. They had way too much control over their vocal cords to be casual karaoke weekender types. I'd even say they'd proably wipe the floor clean with most Top 40 autotuning dorks. Only problem is - if you're gonna sing your token Elvis song in every key but the one it's playing in, you probably don't wanna follow right after one of them. LOL. Place is in a mall that used to have a Fry's - it recently shut down. There's also an I Sushi & Teppan and Burger King in the same mall at the SE corner of Ray and Rural. Plenty of parking - it's in a mall where the biggest store is now closed. Will be back sometime."}
{"text":"Fullers is a very special place!!!!!  A wonderfully diverse group of patrons - Top Notch Service - Fantastic Food - Family Friendly :)  Karaoke from a wide array of genres and talent levels.  Locally owned and operated - down home atmosphere in the middle of the big city :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Our fourth time here, and we'll keep coming back. Wings are great -try Jesse style!  The burgers are excellent and two-for-one on Friday/Saturday.  The owner Shelley and her peeps are fun. It's the perfect neighborhood hangout with good food, plenty of TVs, and oh, did I mention potatoes?   Tots and baked and fries and all things Idaho...."}
{"text":"Previously Fullers. Also came here around 130pm Saturday and kitchen hours don't start daily until 3pm."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years . I love this place . Alicia and Shelley are the best ..Best wings in town!!"}
{"text":"Been going to fullers for a long time now despite it being a broncos bar and me being a chargers fan it is the best bar in chandler! The owner and staff is the best I have experienced in AZ! So friendly and welcoming! I would recommend this bar to anyone and everyone! But fuck the Broncos! Goo Chargers!  : )"}
{"text":"I walked into this place and immediately got a weird look from one of the patrons.  The crowd was an older crowd I usually wouldn't associate with anyway.   I sat down and ordered a nine dollar drink,  which I don't believe had all the ingredients it claimed to have had.  I've been drinking often and for many years.   I'm not saying I'm proud of that I'm just saying I know when a drink should be an AMF.  This was water with some blue curacao in it.   Then I got their chicken sandwich and it was way over cooked.  Just an awful experience.   I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone,  even my enemy."}
{"text":"I love a cold beer. Who doesn't, right? It's weird how some joints serve just chilled beer, especially in AZ. This place serves ice cold beer - it's so good.   This restaurant/ bar is also very clean. It's homey interior has a cabin vibe. It reminds me of a bar in Northern Arizona. It's dark, as the windows are filmed, and it has an open floor plan. I went there with a family member who chose a table against the wall. The table and menus were clean, and our server did a great job. I had a large beer, which was nice and cold, as mentioned, while the other person had a coke. We ordered appetizers. Here's where the stars fade.   The fried pickles were fried to death. I could tell our server was embarrassed to serve them. I wished she hadn't. They were so fried that they disintegrated when we picked them up. The wings were tasty, but were almost all drums, which is a shame if you want a bit of each. I'm not the kind of person to send food back, and the place was filled with regulars, so I'd look like an asshat, but let's just say, I was glad for that beer.   I'll definitely go back though, because it really is a nice spot that maybe had a rough time during my visit. Still, I can only judge based on my visit this time for now."}
{"text":"Ahhh, where to start.  Went with some peers and it was a big disappoinment.  The fries were under cooked. theye didn't have a few itemsbecause they were out in the kitchen and my fired chicken sandwich was so overdone that the edges were inedible.  When I told the cook, she looked shocked.  I then asked what the happy hour drink speacial were and she told me to look at the walls....huh?  The waitress did then proceed to tell me wehat they were. They did however give me \"gift money\" to come back another day. I will say that it was pretty nice on the inside.  It's a shame because there is so much potential but I don't see it lasting."}
{"text":"Small place but great, friendly service.  I had the nachos and two kinds of wings.  The food was amazing for bar food.  Just a really cool adorable sports bar."}
{"text":"Ahhhh yeah fuller's is the best place. I come here all the time we have a blast here I love karaoke night. That place is poppin. No bad vibes. Everyone is frinedly. I spend plenty of money here and I plan on keeping it that way. I love the staff. If you wanna drive Chris the bar tender crazy sing country. But I will always be at this bar no matter what. Go shelley"}
{"text":"My friend and I met up for dinner here last night and it was a blast! The food was so good! I got the nachos-half order and that was even huge! The atmosphere was very lively with a whole lot of country music (my scene) it is an older crowd; 40s maybe, but I still had a blast! Super laid back, fun place."}
{"text":"I really really want to like this place and I keep going, hoping that the service will improve but it doesn't.... so I guess it is not a fluke and the service is the worst in town."}
{"text":"Had a blast at Fuller's for karaoke on a Saturday night.  The karaoke list they have is quite large and I was surprised at how many songs they had.  With a packed house, I still managed to sing 4 songs when I was there.  4 songs is a lot for me so I was quite happy.  The atmosphere was great and the crowd was of all ages and everybody seemed to have a great time.  The only downside was the service but I'm not going to pin that on the bartender or waitress.  There were only 2 of them working plus the cook in the kitchen so they were real busy.  When you have 1 tending bar and the other waiting on about 50 people in there that is a lot for 2 people to handle.  Our party we brought in was a table of 14.  The food was good so that was a plus.  We will be back.  I like the fact that they are advertising karaoke 5 nights a week right now.  The prices were good too.  If you're looking for a great bar to sing karaoke, I recommend you come to Fuller's."}
{"text":"Literally the best first experience I've ever had. They were so crowded but they handled it well. The bartenders are on top of their game, they kept the place clean, the drinks picked up and refilled and even the messes picked up all of it in a very timely manner. They are gay friendly which makes it to me one of the best bars ever!. They have karaoke 5 days a week, the food is great, the drinks are priced right. I will definitely be going back and possibly planning a party there. The host of karaoke was awesome!. Loved this place"}
{"text":"Karaoke on Saturdays is awesome. The hot wings are amazing just order 24 you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE EVER!!!! Amazing food, service and Karaoke!!! Shelly the owner cares about her staff and customers. Amber is the best bartender they have and will make you feel at home. I won't be anywhere else but here!"}
{"text":"I. Love. This. Bar. First off, this place is clean and kept clean all night. Also, every employee we've met is friendly and effective. Also also, the food is incredible. We've tried burgers, fried mushrooms, chicken strips, salad, and it's all been amazing. We'll be regulars here for sure!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place. The food is amazing!  Best service in town!!!   The menu has so many great selections. Great neighborhood bar!!!!!"}
{"text":"My server Alicia Rodriguez was a fantastic server. She has such a great personality and made my experience here amazing. Thanks Alicia for being the best girl!"}
{"text":"This place is not worth the trip. Food was average at best, and not the one $ as advertised. I should have known since there are almost no pics of food in their gallery. Why did SE the bartender post a dozen pictures of herself on the page? Is she that in love with herself? Find another place if your looking for food."}
{"text":"I am in town for a wedding of a close friend and we had an 80s pre party here last night. My first time to Arizona, and first to Fullers. What a great sports bar. The staff (Shelly and Megan) were on it. This place was PACKED and drinks and food were flying. Apparently an 80s themed birthday AND pre wedding party all on the same night equals tons of people. The karaoke guy was fun and did a great job. The bar was clean, the restroom was clean and stocked,  I sat at the bar so I could see into the kitchen each time the door opened which was a dishwashing area and that was clean....  I love a clean well kept bar. The drinks were awesome, both in size and tastiness. I heard they have a pretty cool bartender named Sam too. Might have been a runor though. Overall this place rocks and is definitely 5 stars. Recommend it to anyone looking for good drinks, food, and some karaoke. I will be back when i am in town again."}
{"text":"Fullers is one of my familiar spots I frequent, especially for karaoke (I think I might have a problem).  Conveniently located for me on ray and rural in Chandler, its a fun spot to go hang.   Although not the biggest in size, in can get quite crowded on Friday and Saturday nights.  Also during karaoke they have $.99 you call it from 9-10.    The staff has good personality and are accommodating.  See a lot of regulars there so its a cool spot to make new friends.  Come try it out!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite bar & grill everything I've had is amazing. The staff is very nice and makes you feel at home this place is a family favorite"}
{"text":"This was the 1st bar my Hubbie and I went to since we moved here from Brooklyn, The bar has a great atmosphere great food and great service. And you anyone who goes here should try their GHOST HOT WINGS!!!!  Shelley is a great bartender"}
{"text":"Found this place a few weeks ago with my girlfriend. The staff is really great!! I have now been there 3 times and each time my friends and I have a blast. We have met the staff : Shelly and Chris who are super friendly and make you feel welcome. The crowd is diverse and everyone is friendly. They offer karokee and I have heard some really great singers. I have been there on a Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.  for a good time. Oh and my favorite is the bruschetta that they make..yummy.."}
{"text":"A bar worth your time!  Friendly staff, amazing food - awesome atmosphere. The drinks are tasty, the food is worth getting there early before the evening kicks off to get your dinner on. Karaoke hosts there are a blast and keep the good times rolling.  Hat's off to Fuller's, you've earned some new regulars and people who will refer you to their friends!"}
{"text":"I had a nice response from the owner or manager.  What a pleasure it is to have a polite response.  I'm going back this week because of the yummy food."}
{"text":"Wow I wanted hot-wings and I ordered the satan flavored wings and did I get what I wanted. hot hot. So if you want great wings with a little heat and ice cold beer this place will work!"}
{"text":"Fullers is a small neighborhood bar, very friendly! We've stopped in a few times for a beer.  Love the owner Shelly, she's very friendly!"}
{"text":"Love coming here & did when it was still known as Fuller's. The owner is awesome & her customer service is top notch. The food here is really good & this place offers a great beer & alcohol selection.   Karaoke is a blast here. If you're looking for a great place to get your singing groove on & have a fun time, look no further because you've found it!"}
{"text":"Super fun atmosphere! They have karaoke nights great drink specials and amazing wings!"}
{"text":"Come here all the time when the dynamic duo is working! Santana and Alicia are the BEST. Santana came up with the BEST lemon garlic wing creation EVER! Santana's food is creative, innovative and wonderful. The service we received from Alicia is the best. Alicia is happy, funny, friendly and efficient ! Best DUO in the valley!"}
{"text":"I've loved this bar for the past 4 1/2 years but I gotta say the recent changes are awesome! It feels more spacious with the removal of the 'couch and the new DJ booth is one of a kind. The new menu still has most of the old favorites but has some great new additions like the Barnyard Burger...YUM! You can also buy six packs, well liquor, wine, and growlers. And, the staff is amazing and it's still the best place for karaoke. Come check out the new sign and the cool Sawtooth swag (I've got mine). I know this will continue to be my neighborhood bar for years to come!!"}
{"text":"I love Sawtooth, they have the best and delicious chicken wings.  The staff is very friendly it's like a family bar everyone is nice people enjoy having a drink with everyone around. Even the guests seem like you have known them forever."}
{"text":"love this place.....Owner, Shelly, she busts her butt to keep the customers happy! Very nice to see an owner working hard with pride....shows she cares about keeping her business going! When it's a fun place to be, you want to see it stay in business!"}
{"text":"Cozy place with lots of TV's. Very sporty place....Food options look good, also the Beer is priced very Low which is Awesome. The workers are Very friendly and the people are polite ,  I will be back to the \"Man Cave\" Let's Go   E A G L E S !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I met up with some friends at Fullers on a Sat night for karaoke & drinks.  This place gets packed quickly, and yes there was only 2 people working the crowd, but service really wasn't slow, and even with a bunch of people service was friendly too.  Fullers has a great vibe to it, people of all ages just getting along and having a good a time. You can tell this is a favorite local neighborhood bar.  Looking forward to the next get together with friends for some food, drinks & karaoke!"}
{"text":"Food was terrible. I've had better nachos at Taco Bell. Prices were high. Server had no idea about the menu or the restaurant.  The claim is that the owner is from Idaho and serves real Idaho potatoes, but the server told us that they were really just chips."}
{"text":"We just tried out this place on the recommendation of friends, and weren't disappointed.  It's in a strip mall not too far from our home and is pretty unassuming from then outside.  But the inside is spacious for a fairly small bar with lots of televisions for watching sports.    The trouble with \"sports bars\", although I hesitate to call this place a sports bar, even with the healthy number of screens, is that the food tends to be pedestrian and spotty.  Not so here.  While we've only been here twice, the food has been great thus far.  The wings (my addiction) are large and cooked perfectly with a good selection of sauces.  And the burgers are awesome!  We hope to explore more of the menu on future visits.   Shelley, the owner, is a pleasant and funny lady, very personable and obviously cares about her restaurant.  Wait staff is friendly and efficient.   I understand that Sawtooth is a re-do of a former longtime bar in the same location.  Looks like they've done a good job in the transition, and we'll definitely be back.  They have karaoke for the amateur singers out there, and it has the feel of a good old fashioned neighborhood hangout.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Great selection of Beer and liquor. The Owner/Bartender is friendly, efficient, and fun!  We always feel welcome and have a good time. AND the Karaoke is GREAT on Wednesdays and Sundays! We try not to miss it :-)"}
{"text":"I've been a patron for several years, and this is always my go-to spot for a bite, a drink, and of course karaoke. The staff is amazing, the beer is always cold... what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and got the lemon pepper wings. Soooooo good! It took awhile to get my order, but the wings were so good that it was worth the wait!  This place used to be Long Wong's. I would give this place 4-stars if I was a sports fan. TV's everywhere with sports on."}
{"text":"Bill. Karaoke. Wheelchairs. Puke. Add these together and you get one hell of a time. Shelly is super good people.  Definitely the right personality for this place. Rolls with the punches.  Can't wait til  next time.  Oh yeah, try the captain crunch chicken strips."}
{"text":"Shelley is a phenomenal owner and a great person!  she makes everyone feel at home and this is exactly why I return to this place. She puts her all  into this bar and does a great job! If you can't get over your immature ways wah wah wah  I didn't get my song in  get over it! No one wants to listen to jt just FYI. So instead of bashing Shelley why don't you find a different bar to talk about because I'm sure anyone reading these reviews is annoyed that you can't just move on and stop acting like a child grow up!"}
{"text":"Great menu, great happy hour, great karaoke- 90% can actually sing!  Ive met the most random and some of the coolest people here. Anyone will feel comfortable here. Good people that take pride."}
{"text":"Love this place! It used to be Fullers & I still refer to it as that. Owner is friendly and usually tending bar. Great karaoke and cheap brews."}
{"text":"Karaoke is a lot of fun, and drinks are decently priced. The place is small, but we didn't mind that. The bartender did have a slight attitude when we asked for an update on our order that we placed over an hour beforehand."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Very chill, good location and the staff is great! Love the set up and decor as well..great job! Thank you to the new owners!"}
{"text":"No patio.  TV setup at bar is odd. Biggest TV is behind a huge hole/walkway in the bar so only a few seats have prime views. But the TV of which I speak is actually a very crappy LCD projector that's too light/washed out.  Poor TV sound.  VERY EXPENSIVE DRINKS!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here to grab some drinks after an amazing movie and it overall put a damper on the mood. When we initially walked in everyone stared and it was hard to even tell who was working. We were not greeted in any way. The bartender eventually came over, failed to introduce herself or say hi. She was very short with us and walked away assuming our order. She didn't even say \"you're welcome\" or anything when I politely thanked her, even though she was completely stale with us we were still nice to her. As soon as we felt her mean vibe we decided to just have one drink and close out. When we told her we wanted to close out she literally rolled her eyes at my date. She then proceeded to give us our change and walk away annoyed again ignoring our \"thank you.\" Needless to say we won't be coming back. It's sad really when servers are rude, they never know when they could literally ruin someone mood and not to mention ruin your tip. Her attitude needs to be fixed if this place plans on making anymore new regulars. Besides the service this place had potential."}
{"text":"I am new in town and went to Fuller's cuz it was close and had karaoke--the reviews didn't disappoint!  The regulars took me in and were sooo nice, and the DJ was awesome!  I'm looking forward to many more visits!"}
{"text":"Great food and super friendly staff/owner. Amazing place to watch football. Busy but not overwhelmingly so. The food is worth a visit on its own but the staff and patrons make it worth while to visit. Here on business and found this great bar/restaurant"}
{"text":"So I came in this place about a month ago.  Great food, great atmosphere, an awesome staff and of course Karaoke with the best hosts!!!  I'm hooked!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and AMAZING WINGS! Friendly staff and fun atmosphere. I love this bar. Great spot to watch the games on one of the 12 great TVs!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and drinks, Idaho fries are amazing. Food is fresh and portions are large. Quality TV's for all the games...owner is awesome and runs a great bar!"}
{"text":"Their wings are amazing! The service is fast and friendly and the owner is hilarious! Great price and fun atmosphere! I recommend the chicken strips too"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Especially for Karaoke!!! I spent my 30th birthday here sight unseen! (I'm an old man now!) Shelly was great and very accommodating! They have good food and strong drinks :) The entire crew was quite friendly too. We had a table of 9 people and they took good care of us. Will definitely be back soon :*"}
{"text":"I'm not a picky person but let's be honest you can screw up beer and wings.  I found my new hot spot at Fullers bar and grill...:and Shelly knows how to keep it flowing.  Beer/Wings/Babes all you need.  The atmosphere is perfect for beer wings and game, Im all in."}
{"text":"Live in the area, didn't want to cook dinner, reviews were good. Nice little spot with a good vibe. Smoked parmesan wings stole the show. Type of spot for beer with your babe without the rowdy sports bar vibe, despite being a sports bar. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Went here for a few cold brews on a Sunday night. Barely anyone there that night but it's a new establishment. They had cornhole which was enjoyable to play with the pals. Large LCD tv's all around the walls. Clean place , relax environment, friendly staff. Will check it out again another time."}
{"text":"Very friendly bar and nicely set up. We watched March Madness and had a few reasonably priced beers. The food was surprisingly outstanding. Definitely will come back next time I'm in Chandler."}
{"text":"From Montana and have been looking for a great bar for 14 months.  This is it.  Great food and atmosphere.  A real bar, I would call it a saloon if it wasn't in a strip mall.  Say hi to the owner Shelly, she has a great thing going."}
{"text":"Really Really disappointed..... This was going to be our first stop for the evening. Grab a couple of drinks, eat and head out to another place to see a band. When we walked in, it looked like a great place. We luckily found a place at the bar and sat... and sat.... and sat. Then finally, we got service, ordered a couple of drinks and poof!-She was gone again. About 15 min later (empty glasses and all) we were able to flag her down and ask for menus. Then we waited for about 30 min before we were able to get ANYONE'S attention to place an order. We ordered wings with tots and fried mushrooms and then went on to wait for OVER AN HOUR before we finally said we just wanted to cancel and go. She then told us our order was in the fryer and was going to be out in just a few minutes. 15 min later we got part of our food (mushrooms never showed) and they only brought 1 tiny cup of ranch for 12 wings. We would've ordered more but no one ever came back to ask us how anything was or if we needed anything. To make it worse - the VERY inebriated man at the bar next to us who was on his way out when we walked in had asked to cash out and he was there waiting THE ENTIRE TIME for his check! I just love being rubbed on and leaned against when I am HANGRY and annoyed.   This was such a bad experience. Our night was ruined. I won't go out of my way to return to this place again."}
{"text":"Great time celebrating a buddy's birthday. Very friendly staff and great food. Try the finger stakes. It's different but if your from Idaho you'll also appreciate the fry sauce. Ask for it."}
{"text":"So we came to Sawtooth Bar & Grill after having several people tell me how good it was.  We went and decided on the Boneless Wings, 2 different orders, one Medium, the other Honey Hot.  Both of the orders were exceptional.  The vibe here was great, very laid back.  I definitely will be back.  My wife said that this is absolutely our new favorite place.  What I've learned after 14 years of marriage is the translation on that means we will be coming back, a lot.  I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Only two people were in the bar - ordered Stella - they don't carry it - date ordered a crown coke back - came back 5 minutes later to say they were out of crown - ordered a replacement that tasted so bad she couldn't drink it - ordered two waters forgot them both - ordered chips and Salsa chips way too salty - salsa a bland fire hot - couldn't eat it - so left 1/2 both drinks and chips and went to cks - let's you know how good cks really is"}
{"text":"Went to Fuller's last night with a large group of friends from college for a mini reunion of sorts. We were looking for a low-key bar with awesome karaoke, great drinks, fun atmosphere and good food. We most definitely found that at Fuller's! The service was great, the bar itself was comfy and clean, the food was delish and the general vibe of the bar is fabulous! I really wish I still lived in AZ because this would be \"my place\" for sure! Bars with karaoke can be annoying sometimes but I tell you, the singers at Fuller's are INCREDIBLE and fun (and didn't take themselves too seriously which is refreshing)! The karaoke host, Phil was upbeat, professional and a really awesome singer himself (my group was hugging him as we left)! I definitely know where I'll be heading with my girlfriends next time I'm in town. Thank you Fuller's & Phil for a great night!!"}
