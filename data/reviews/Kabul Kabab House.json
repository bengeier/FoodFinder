{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! 

It's not the prettiest inside, but the food is cooked to order and under $7 INCLUDING TAX. I'm talking a generous portion of real barbeque chicken breasts, rice, and a side salad. 

That's unheard of!

The owner is extremely nice and I can't believe after eating around Little India for 10 years I've never seen this place. They don't even have a sign. Apparently, they specialize in catering so maybe that's how I've missed this place but I'll be coming back to dine for sure!"}
{"text":"Really really unassuming place. 

I'm running late. Need something to go...fast. My 1:30 zipcar delivery of a Craigslist purchase arrives soon. It's 1:00 & I'm an 8min walk  from home, kabob fits the bill.  He has 5-stars, but only 2 reviews...friends/family.  I have no choice. 

The older gentleman, I assume owner/chef, pushed the chicken kabob. I\"m wary. Chefs do this A) to get rid of stuff B) to sell higher priced items  C) to spread the love.  His energy tells me it's C).

It was delicious.  It's not fancy and the salad was just iceberg and tomatoes, but the rice and grilled chicken were delicately seasoned and cooked perfectly.  

Great find!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the restaurant was not the prettiest. It's good for takeout (cash only - no debit machine), but I wouldn't go there to dine."}
{"text":"My family has catered food from this place multiple times and it's one of the better Afghan places to order food from, especially for large numbers. Their kabli rice and beef kababs are really good.
However, what I absolutely love this restaurant is something that doesn't fit in with the theme at all - their chicken wings.  Consider getting the BBQ chicken wings as a side.  They've got a sweet and tangy sauce that they're smothered in and it tastes like heaven.  Bring your appetite cause you get quite a bit!
Not going to lie, the place looks quite shabby and rundown.  Just a warning so you don't expect fancy."}
