{"text":"Great atmosphere during Happy Hour. Had the Fuego mansana cocktail and it was a wonderful balance of heat on the rim and sweetness from the drink. My steak was cooked preciously to medium like i ordered and the mac and cheese side was great. Also has the creamed spinach and it could have used some more cream but overall outstanding experience for an off the strip steakhouse."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and friendly staff were not enough to compensate for my over cooked steak. Also ordered the \"poblano and parmesan\" creamed corn, wouldn't recommend it unless you just want corn and bread crumbs. It was flavorless. The best part of our meal were the crab cakes. Ruth Cris is a safer bet for my money."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Might have been an off day for the waiters, but seated then ignored for over 10 min.  No menus, no water, nobody even came over.  For the prices that they charge, I expected far better service."}
{"text":"Service and food were outstanding. Lobster tail was grilled perfectly and was so sweet . The lobster bisque was heaven....The service was impeccable..Will return!"}
{"text":"The way to this girls heart is thru a juicy, flavorful steak... preferably a Ribeye!   Well that's just what I got at Hanks.. went in with my husband & shared the 28 oz Ribeye.. huuuuge I know.. lol! That's why we shared it.. And all their sides are served family style.. 2-4 people serving.. we got augratin potatoes & asparagus.. Both were phenomenal.  I ordered french onion soup for app & thought it was waaaay tooo salty. My husband got a wedge salad.. can't go wrong!   Opted out for dessert.. we were way too full..lol"}
{"text":"Having frequented Hank's in the past, it was the perfect locale for my husband's 50th celebration with the family and a few friends on a Thursday night (off holiday hours). With six out of eight guests ordering cuts, we were eager to enjoy the anticipated delicious meal ahead of us. Disappointingly, 4 out 6 steaks were grossly under cooked. Three \"medium well\"s were served \"rare\" and the one \"rare\" was served still mooing... There were no offerings to butterfly our cuts upon ordering and although I know it takes time to cook a thick cut properly to order, the steaks should have been prepared as ordered. One of the four ageeed to have his returned for further time on the flame, but after only 10 minutes, was still too rare to consume. After our complaint, the once attentive wait staff was now unseen and the Manager fully disregarded the circumstance. With a $1,000 tab and four empty bellies, only the returned steak was comped. A very disappointing experience is an under statement and a return visit is highly unlikely. An unfortunate outcome for one of our past faves..."}
{"text":"WORSE service I have ever received in a restaurant.  Food was just ok."}
{"text":"Returned last night with a friend for tater tots, mac & cheese, and a prime rib sliders. Most disappointing experience I've ever had here.   First, the menu has reverted back to what I know to be normal so I'm happy about that. Unfortunately, the mac & cheese is now made with rigatoni & little cheese.  That the pasta was undercooked & arrived cold made it worse.  Our amazing server quickly removed it from our table and bill and brought au gratin instead. Sadly, this dish too had problems: the potatoes were hard. Rock hard. Au gratin & mac & cheese should both me creamy, soft, scrumptious carb goodness.  Both of these were huge failures. Another order of mac & cheese arrived as well & while warmer than cold, it was still bad.   The tater tots were okay.  They reminded me of mini hush puppies on the outside. But inside, where was the potato?  I couldn't find find it. ANOTHER fail.   Prime rib sliders. Not bad.  Not great either. No where on the bar menu did it say horseradish (or they would not have been ordered due to an allergy), and after being told the white stuff covering them was cheese, we were immediately corrected & told it was in fact horseradish. 3 sliders immediately sent back & returned without the smelly white stuff.   The only two things that made our time here enjoyable was 1) catching up with a friend I've not seen in ages, and 2) our server. She was fantastic! Super sweet & attentive. I wish I knew her name.   Doubt I'll be back. If I return, no sides for me."}
{"text":"The minute you walk in the ambience is breath taking , sheer blue curtains warm tones and glowing fire places. I loved the golden details on the blue plates on the table.  We started of with crab and shrimp cocktail, it was simply delicious my crab was fresh meaty , the cocktail sauce is great very flavorful and a hint of spice. The real treat as other have said is the creamed corn.. Wow! Absolutely delicious so creamy and sweet with a bit of crunch on the top, we had the garlic mashed potaeos , which are garlicy but I love garlic so we were happy. For dessert we had the creme brûlée and the fried oreas.  The brûlée was big enough to share and the fried oreas were warm and fluffy but I was disappointed with the ice cream thought it would be sweeter. The Martinis were a treat I loved my pear martini just the right about of alcohol and sweetness. Yes, I would recommend this place but I would go back and sit at the bar. They have happy hour for Martinis and appetizers. We had steaks and they were good but I felt I could get the same steak elsewhere for the price. I look forward to returning at the bar with friends as I think it's a better fit for me as there was a lot of food and we ended up boxing our entrees , I would recommend if in the area ."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of steaks from a ton of dive to high end restaurants around the country. Hank's is absolutely one of the best. We came in on a Sunday night when it was a bit slower and the restaurant was only out of 2 items on the menu following a busy weekend. Did not expect it to have such an upscale atmosphere but they didn't bat an eye at our very casual attire. The tuna appetizer was melt in your mouth delicious. For entree's we ordered a medium rare steak, fried chicken, mushrooms, and asparagus. Not a single criticism we could think of. Service was from 3 people that were always ready but never pushing to refresh drinks, clear plates, and engage us on the next part of our meal.  Overall, the evening was very pricey but it was a really good experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went to Hank's on a sunday evening. This is the second time in a row the food and service was down right mediocre. Martinis good, steaks very average.We got one basket of bread for four and requested more at least 6 times and received none even after being told it would be right out. Asked for waters at least 6 times and did not get one glass. The waitress had no help bussing or serving water if asked. There we sat with no bread for quite awhile. Then some people from the kitchen brought our salads. about two minutes later the dinners showed up. The fries were extra soggy. We will not be back to this way over priced restaurant. You are much better off going to another Station Casino restaurant like Sonoma at Sunset Station or the Broiler at Boulder Station for atmosphere and value."}
{"text":"Ok so there are tons of steak places in Vegas, but our friends from there suggested this place.  I wasn't too sure since it is out far away and a BJ's is next door, and a Movie theater downstairs... I wasn't sure what to expect.  Wow, was I amazed!  We ate here on 6/19/14 a Thursday night.  They had live music, but we sat in the dining room...it's funny because they pulled out the table because it's difficult to slide in on the couch material...you'll have to take my word on that.  My wife and I shared a cocktail, \"Berry basil Bliss\"  it was good.  Then we ordered a \"dozen raw oysters\", those were fresh, very good. We also order the \"fried calamari\", and it was good but with the bread they give you and what we ordered we could have passed it up.  We both shared the \"Prime bone in 22 oz. Rib Eye\" that is wet aged for a minimum of 14 days and dry aged for 28 days...this steak, wow...it was so good, I ordered it medium rare, and that's how it came out, perfect flavor and texture and right amount of fat. I'm already craving going back there as I write this review.  The wait staff was great and attentive and at the end they gave us a small assorted dessert which was awesome as well.  So if you are really into fine steak places, I would recommend to skip the strip and drive a little further to hanks."}
{"text":"My fiancé received the most disgusting service BEFORE even entering the restaurant. He arrived just before 5pm (opening time) and asked for a table. The hostess whose name he did not get told him the restaurant was not open just yet to which he offered to sit at the bar and then order once the kitchen opened. The misguided and extremely unintelligent hostess told him that he couldn't afford a place like Hanks. He was dressed in t-shirt & jeans which was not sloppy or in bad shape. Regardless of dress no one should EVER be told you look like you cannot afford to eat in an establishment. If there is a specific type of dress code that is enforced then that is okay to say to a patron.  However in this day and age you can never make that type of judgment based entirely on what someone is wearing. It left a terrible taste in our mouths after that type of treatment therefore we will never come back to Hanks regardless of the food & drinks. Customer service is always  number one."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great special night out Hanks is your place. Food is outstanding and employees provide world class service. Only negative is if there is music in the front bar area, the sound travels into the dining room and is a distraction. Prices are high but I do not mind since the experience is worth the price."}
{"text":"Although I don't eat meat, I do love this place! The ambiance and decorating is worth 5 stars. The restaurant is classy and elegant. It was a pleasant surprise considering it is inside an older casino in Henderson.   Menu is adequate even for a vegetarian and the kitchen will work with you. The Mac n Cheese is the absolute best in the world!"}
{"text":"Five stars for being the only real steakhouse is Henderson. I love the fact that is so close to home, and offers really the best steak around. I always order the filet, and it never ceases to please. The creamed corn is amazing, and has a crispy top layer which I have never seen before. If you enjoy wine, this is your place. If you enjoy a fine martini (like myself) this is your place. If you know your steaks, this is your place. Pretty much, this is my place. Expect a bill of at least $150 for two people, and that is only a starting point. But if you are in the mood, splurge a bit. I promise, you will be glad you did.   The pianist is has a terrible voice, but that's just a personal opinion. And it doesn't matter what he plays, he could never stop me from enjoying Hank's. The food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Not as good as the price, although the bone-in filet was great. Had the oysters and for $18 got 6 tiny thin oysters... one had no meat, just skin. Meh."}
{"text":"The place is high end, food Is great but reason for my review is the best martini I have ever had.  The  bartender name Bartec is a true professional and he made my bday memeorable. Will be back next bday."}
{"text":"It's a fine dining setting & atmosphere BUT with buffet quality food & chefs. The food is just plain bland. I've been here multiple times just to use my casino comps.   Courtney was a gr8 bartender & extremely attentive. Her barbacks could step it up a notch n bus the adjacent lounge section though.   If the former Light Group managed this place, there'd be a great improvement in food quality. It's hard to mess up a basic steak. They did n I'm not talking about the temp. Taste. Yikes!"}
{"text":"My new favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas... Bone in filet and lobster were to die for. James and Kenny, our servers, were amazing! Their sommelier Joey was kind enough to let us taste different wines and champagne. General manager Brooke stopped by our table multiple times to make sure everything was great. WOW. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"First time at the steakhouse. Claudio as our waiter. He started off strong. Friendly, funny and excellent communication. Ordered the 48 ounce T-Bone that my wife and I split. Claudio cut it table side, poured our wine, and I'm not joking when I tell you that the next time he stopped at our table was to hand us our check. Our wine glasses were getting low so I did everything but send up a flare to get  his attention.  No luck.  We ordered the steak at Med-Rare Plus but the ends were Medium well. There's enough meat on the plate to work around it, but it would have been nice for our Waiter, the manager, the busboy, a friend of the busboy, a cousin of the waiter, the cute hostess or even her parents to drop by and see how we were doing. Instead, we got the check and were on our way. I would normally start a political roundtable and various discussion groups at the restaurant, but we were late for a show, and as they say, the show must go on."}
{"text":"The decor is amazing here, absolutely loved the huge fireplace and all the chandeliers.  This is a great place to dine for a special occasion.  Everything we ordered was great and the 3-servers were all very friendly and attentive.  Our steaks were cooked perfectly and were so flavorful they did not need any sauce.  There was a top 10 Las Vegas steakhouses list and this one is better than the #3 restaurant that we dined at on Valentines Day."}
{"text":"Promptly greeted and seated by hosts at a lovely table. Wrong wine by the glass served after waiting 27 minutes, another 11 minutes for the right one.  Wine served but not announced. \"I got his drinks\". Another employee said as serving the wine.  Nice bread selection, 5 kinds not announced.  Butter looked like it was served with olive oil red clay and black volcanic Hawaiian sea salt not announced.  Backhanded service, bent silverware.  Ahi poke and oysters not announced.  WBTG not poured tableside. Parachute table linen on resets.  \"You guys\" and not may I clear this. Crab cakes not eaten, not did you enjoy these \"do you want me to wrap these\"? We did not, lots of filler.  Somm didn't know which Hartford court pinot I was served. First course took 23 minutes to serve Poke and oysters. 2nd course took 19. I poured my own wine from the small craft.  3rd round offered by server then he was gone again to return 17 minutes later and we had not ordered entrees yet.  Check please.   As we are leaving saw what appeared to be one manager at the door and three times saw what appeared to be another manager walking around.  At no time, did I ever see a manager talking to a table which explains the really low level of service. VERY slow service and I guess no one is told when a plate of food (our crab cakes) is cleared but not consumed or taken to go. This was our first visit.  VERY disappointing after reading the reviews prior to making this reservation. We are heading to SW steakhouse Tuesday."}
{"text":"The filet was perfect. The wine, service and ambiance was perfect!! We will definitely return on our annual visit to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at this restaurant recently. To say it was disappointing would be an understatement. We started off with the California salad (I believe that was the name) which had no taste. Maybe they forgot the dressing. I had the petite filet and my husband had a filet. We ordered it to be done medium. The entire steak was burnt on the outside and pretty dry on the inside. For a side we had a baked yam. That was literally what was served. A huge plain baked yam on a plate for us to split ourselves. There were some items that we could add to it on the side of the plate. On a positive note they did have my favorite wine and my husband's favorite craft beer. The staff was friendly and polite. With saying that, I think our waitress as fairly new. It is unfortunate that we had such a poor experience. If it was better, and if we felt it was worth the money, we would have returned again this week."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our anniversary!!!  We both got the scallop dish. The salad we had was way over dressed!  The scallops all had different cooks on them. There were some that were raw (seared on 1 side) some were way over cooked (seared on both sides) some super over cooked (seared on 3 sides). Both dishes were served with RAW kale. If you have ever had raw kale it is super crunchy and does not taste very good.  But if we had to pick the best thing on our $50 each dish it would of been the RAW kale.  When we got our check, our drink prices were all 5-8 dollars more expensive than what was listed on their drink menu..  When I pointed it out to one of our waiters they told the manager. However when he came back he told me that once something is rung up they can't change the price on something.  I went ahead and paid because I did not want to give our anniversary a bad energy.   I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. If you do go check the prices on the menu and make sure that is what they charge you!!! If I could give a zero star I would."}
{"text":"Went in around 5 and sat at the bar, service was good. Unfortunately, the food was disappointing for the price, I had the sliders and the ahi tacos. The meat in the sliders was dry and bland, apparently there was supposed to be horseradish, but I could barely taste any which would have made the flavor profile much better. The ahi tacos had an overbearing amount of guacamole, honestly taste like I was eating expensive chips with guacamole."}
{"text":"Attended the Cakebread wine dinner on 1/29/15. Very unorganized, start time was 6pm but did not start until approx 6:45. Extremely noisy. First course scallops was excellent, even though it was cold, probably sitting out for a long time. Soup was cold, and salad was supposed to have goat cheese in it but what was served to me did not. Bison was ok, again cold and no taste but was tender. Desserts  very good. All in all, food was disappointing. Wine was very good but small pourings, inconsistent with coming around to fill glass. During the introduction, they announced that the Cakebread rep would come to every table to answer questions, she did not."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite steakhouses.  It has been slipping for years now. No more Hank's for me"}
{"text":"Happy hour is the way to go at Hank's! It was unbelievably good. We were staying at the GVR resort and decided to try Hank's bar lounge for apps and half priced martinis starting at 5pm (apps are large and extremely reasonably priced at $9-$14, martinis are around $14 each). You MUST get the crispy tuna tacos... and the fried Oreos for dessert. They were both spectacular. Everything else we had was excellent, too: king crab leg cocktail and braised beef rib were delicious. We both got the pear martini which comes with a sugar rim, a splash of pineapple, and is very strong but tastes nothing like alcohol. Really yummy. Service was likewise great, and the ambience was classy and fun. Perfect for an early dinner at the bar or a few small bites to start off your night in Vegas. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ok, since my last review, I've spent a great deal of time there.  Our last dinner was a party of about 18 and the food, service and wine list is out of this world!  We had a private room in the back and the staff took excellent care of us. Now on to the Martini Bar...my fav placein LV area to go and since I live across the street, its convenient too.  BART is the best bartender and martini shaker in town!!  2 happy hours nightly, 5 to 7 and 9 to 11 with half price martinis and great appetizers.  Highly recommend the poke tacos and seafood tower.  I tried the spinach lobster dip the other night and was not impressed.  Beautiful bar with live music.  Do the hang loose hand signal to Bart and tell him cindy sent you and he will mix you up the best lemon drop you've ever had!  Haha"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Hanks twice in the last week as part of her birthday celebration. The first night, we split the wedge salad and a side of fries as an appetizer. We each ordered our own steaks (Kansas City between rare and medium rare for me and fillet mignon medium rare for Nicole). We also split sides of grilled asparagus and truffle mashed potatoes. We finished with a slice of cheesecake and a creme brûlée. Last night, we shared the wedge salad, split a cheese burger and finished with cheesecake. I also tried some of their signature classic martinis.   First - quality of food:  since we moved to Henderson three years ago,  I have been  hearing how good the steaks are at Hanks. However, being a little snobby, I refused to believe that a Henderson restaurant could match up with fine dining experiences in New York, San Francisco, LA, etc. I was dead wrong!  The lettuce wedge was crisp and fresh. The dressing was creamy and decadent. The bacon and blue cheese made the salad so rich it almost melted in our mouths.  Both of our steaks were perfection.  They did melt in my mouth. Again, the quality of the meet was outstanding. The waiter explained the aging process and I wish I had listened because whatever they did, it works. The asparagus was full of flavor without being in the least bit over charred. All I can say about the fries and mashed potatoes are that they are the crack cocaine of food. Highly addictive. Cheese cake was light, fluffy, creamy and full of rich flavors.  Lastly, the burger. The best for last. I can't even begin to describe how good it tastes. 100%, unequivocally the best burger I've ever had.  Second - portion sizes. We learned on our first visit and confirmed on our second that the portions are enormous. Each of the entrées, sides and appetizers are more suited for 2 to 3 people. The cheesecake slice I think would feed four.   Third - the price. There's no doubt it's extremely expensive. However, now that my wife and I have figured out the plates really can (should) be split, rather than being a once a year extravagance, Hank's certainly is worth at least a once a month pilgrimage. In fact, if I can convince Nicole, I would happily go back at least once a week and split the burger.  If you do that, it's basically 13 bucks a person plus tip for the best burger around plus a very decent portion of fries.  The one negative - cost of wines per glass. The first night we went to dinner there, we ordered a bottle of wine based on the recommendation of the sommelier. We gave him a price point and he recommended a fantastic bottle that was actually $60 less than we had asked for. However, when you want to limit yourself to a glass or two (like last night), the wine offerings are overpriced. It's always a little frustrating when you know three or four of the wines being offered by the glass (including their retail price) and the restaurant price for one glass is significantly more than the retail price of an entire bottle of the same wine."}
{"text":"I agree with Noelle completely. I am also a local and have been coming to Hanks for years for happy hour. I can't believe how poor the service has gotten, it was laughable when I was there last week to celebrate a special occasion. Food is hit or miss and I've has issues with cold dishes being served in the past, but the problems were always dealt with in a professional manner. Most recently there was a problem with my order and I was blamed for it and told it couldn't be fixed because the bartender didn't want to \"waste another drink\" on me. I was shocked. I have always tipped well and been a patron for years, I have never been treated so badly by a bartender. He was passive agressive even. Needless to say I will never be back and recommend that the people I've frequented with take their business elsewhere. As the other poster mentioned Flemings will get you much better food, tremendously better service and a smaller tab at the end of it all. Good riddance Hanks!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  My husband and I are from Washington DC and we wanted a romantic resturant with delicious food.  This place was definitely it."}
{"text":"had a very solid meal here.   Good steak, and attentive servie.  Helpful server and sommelier.  Bring your big limit credit cards, and have a great time."}
{"text":"They make the best Martinis I have experienced.  The beautiful female staff are super  friendly and work very hard to get you taken care of.  I don't think I need to mention the food since I have not a bad dish to date.  I am a regular at Happy Hour."}
{"text":"The server was rude the minute we did not order an alcoholic beverage. The appetizers came out quick and were really delicious. After a very long pause we got the main course and sides. Everything tasted like it had been drenched in salt. The ribeye was the only exception. The server continued to act annoyed because of our comp which was bizarre being its inside a casino and most best clients are given comps to eat there. We ordered one dessert which was bad and was not offered a water refill after all the sodium. The atmosphere was really nice and if the server was pleasant and there wasn't a salt spill on the food the place has potential. This is why I'm still giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Nice place inside GVR...great to slide up to the bar, order up a crown on the rocks and just chill with some friends.  Girls like the martinis here 'cuz there's so many different flavors.  Decor is great, service spot on, and the steaks are primo.  I didn't care too much for their version of  tater tots ( I was expecting the Ore Ida kind but dressed up a bit) but all the other sides were really good.  Steaks here are a close second to Mastro's in BH but the atmosphere and ambiance here blows that place away."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is so pretty and romantic. Service is excellent! Best steakhouse I have been to in Vegas! Perfect date night spot. Also,happy hour is GREAT."}
{"text":"I'm not normally one to complain, but I've been going to Hank's for about 10 years now and have always loved it.  However; tonight, we made dinner reservations and got there early around 5:30 pm and wanted to get a glass of wine and wait on our friend at the bar like many times in the past.  Surprisingly, they had blocked off about 20-30 seats \"reserved by casino hosts\" at the bar and surrounding tables, previously \"first come first serve\" for people wanting to stop in for happy hour drinks.  Nor only that, the 4 waitresses that alternate around were rude and snobby and I was SHOCKED at the massive downgrade in customer service at my once favorite local fine dining and happy hour spot.  There was NO WHERE to even sit with all the empty reserved spots and we were told that happy hour drinks could not be purchased in the main dining area {2 hours to go of happy hour mind you.}  The level of poor customer service was just over the top that I wasn't about to pay for dinner there, and we headed over to Flemings in Town Square.  WAY BETTER ATMOSPHERE, MUSIC + SERVICE.  Lovely vibrant energy.  I sadly will never go back to Hanks after many years of patronage, but I'm stoked to find a much better place that values their loyalty customers and offers amazing fine dining.  Thank you Fleming's!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what an amazing place. I went here with my girl and her family for the first time and can not wait to go again. The service is a big part of my meal when eating at a restaurant and the service here is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Took my husband here for his birthday.  From all of our enjoyable dinners there in the past we were severly disappointed that night.  He of course had steak, I decided to try the much lauded fried chicken.  For sides we had the asparagus, au gratin potatoes and the mushrooms.  The steak was okay but not in the class of its description or price.  The fried chicken -- meh, it was alright.  I had the accompanying sage gravy on the side and was very glad for it as its very over powering with one heavy note of sage. The au gratin potatoes were the only thing I found amazing as they usually were. The asparagus was woody and splintery. The mushrooms were the worst of the bunch.  They again were overpowering one note flavor -- red wine.  There was a smattering of fresh herbs thrown over the top for serving.  But this preparation was a disservice to something that can (when done properly) be such a great complement to main courses. At the end of the meal a mini complementary creme' brulee was served to my husband he said it was good. I asked for the desert menu which they delivered with a plate of mini desert, when we asked what they were we were told \"I don't know\" and he walked away.  Twenty minutes later they finally came back to take my desert order.  I'd given up by this time and we were ready to leave.  We probably will never be back to this restaurant which is a shame as this used to be a wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Have eaten here numerous times and have had excellent service.  Made a reservation for 12.27 and got seated in the private dining room.  Service was poor as it was like we were forgotten about.  Meal came out and it was cold.  Spoke to the manager in regards to my meal being cold and they re-fired the same steak to make it hot without giving me a new one.  When you re-fire the same steak it loses all of its flavor.  Hanks then sat a large group in this area where there was nothing but filth coming out out their mouths and they were very loud and obnoxious.  Had to track the server down to get us our check so we could leave.  Spoke with a different manager when we left in regards to the large party that they sat and what was happening.  He did go out there and then told the hostess not to seat anyone in that area.  What a waste of $200.  Not the best fine dining experience."}
{"text":"This venue is amazing. I came here to see Cali Tucker and I could hear her voice so clearly.   I had a glass of wine recommended by the waitress and it was also very tasteful.  I definitely recommend this venue if you want great live music and very tasteful food.    Hanks Fine Steaks is definitely a place I will 'be revisiting and recommending to friends."}
{"text":"For the price, it was just so-so. The service was a bit awkward and the T-bone Steak was so-so. Steamed asparagus was tasteless... Spinach was a little better. The spinach salad was better than everything else. :-)"}
{"text":"Wow, they must have paid for most of these reviews because this pace Stinks on Ice!  Prime? I don't think so. Pre packaged from the smell of the blood and metalic taste of my MR Ribeye.   Sides? I've seen better sides on Cereal Boxes. Hank Greenspun practicaly built Henderson, the man is a Stallworth and he should have at least a decent Steakhouse named after him. Steakhouses are all over Vegas, one better than the next and with these prices I don't expect the same cuts I can get at The Boiler Room in your other casino for 1/2 the price."}
{"text":"They have completely changed the menu - downgraded quality - service remains excellent - return to original menu - bad corporate decision."}
{"text":"nice ,elegant ambiance.. love the huge bone in rib eye."}
{"text":"I've been to Hanks many times and must been lucky enough to always choose the steak, which i now realize after last night, is the sole reason to eat there My experience last night, was almost entirely unacceptable and definitely not worth the 200 i paid for dinner We started with oysters, which were not fresh and had obviously been sitting in the dry air for awhile Then after waiting a significant amount of time, my asparagus arrived to the table and was already cold They apologized and brought me a new order, which was luke warm, with no butter sauce and very dry and very underwhelming  I then received my prime burger, which was extremely boring and the bottom of the bun was sopping wet and had to be replaced By the time the new bun arrived at the table, the burger was cold and i just had it packed to go Surprisingly, there was nothing special about the bun, it looked no different from a bun you would receive from McDonalds When I politely made mention of my disappointment, the server developed an attitude and no longer cared about pleasing us and was over being our server I will not be returning for awhile and would not recommend them at this point, unless you're in the mood for a 250 dollar steak dinner"}
{"text":"Classy ambiance. Delicious and traditional meals. Pleasant service. We've celebrated a handful of special occasions here as a family and have always had a positive experience. Never disappointed. Great for date nights too! Make sure to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I came here last month with my babe on a Thursday night. We arrived an hour after our reservation but they still allowed us to get points on Opentable, yay! We sat at the bar because we were hungry and didnt want to wait the 20 minutes. Very beautifil decor and the lighting was set dim for a nice romantic dinner. We ordered the Seafood Jumbo Jackpot and the 18oz Bone in Filet Mignon and of courst some martinis. Both dishes were great and satisfying. Service was great and Martinis were nice and strong but had lots of flavor too. Parking was $3 for Valet. We really enjoyed our dining experience and will be back next time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"So... my wife and I were craving a nice steak dinner. We frequent Capital Grille and Fleming's so we are accustomed to a solid atmosphere, service and quality of food. Many of people we know in our neighborhood have talked about Hanks positively and also has 4/5 stars on here. We went in with expectations of a similar quality of said steakhouses. All was good when we arrived. Were taken to a nice table in the back of the restaurant. This had a nice atmosphere and servers were super polite and on top of it.  We ordered our drinks, I ordered an espresso. Just a nice double shot.  About 20 min went by and the server let me know they were having problems with the machine. All good i said. Then we got our breads and she then said we were just going to scrap the espresso because they couldn't figure it out. I thought that was weird. Typically these places have espresso/coffee on point.  Next we order the couple special. 2 massive lobster tails, chopped salad, wagu filet and 2 sides(green beans, garlic mashed potatoes). Dessert was cherries jubilee. Made at your table.  The food did not take long, which was nice. But compared to Capital Grille and Fleming's the steak was not as tender or flavorful. Also a lot of char around the steak overpowered the flavor of the steak. Kinda nit picking but for a $300 meal i would expect better. Mind you Capital Grille is cheaper.  The lobster tail was chewy and tough. The sides were good. I will say that. On to dessert. Cherries jubilee over a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The alcohol flavor greatly over powered the sweetness of the cherries and ice cream. Big bummer.  All in all i don't think we will be going back. Especially when there are other options in town. 3 stars for quality of food for the price. Would recommend either Capital Grille and/or Fleming's."}
{"text":"This restaurant is top notch! The food and service are impeccable. They have a happy hour that is from 4-6pm at the bar which has a vibrant feel. Then when you are ready to be pampered, the main dining room is exquisite and elegant. Be prepared to dress accordingly because when you are surrounded by crystal chandeliers, you don't want to look out of place in this restaurant!"}
{"text":"4.3!   This was a great place for a rehearsal dinner.   Service here was excellent! Great recommendations by the waitstaff to accommodate my many food allergies. They were helpful, funny, and were on top of everything. They even accommodated our additional guests at the last minute.  The food was really good too. I loved the grass fed bison filet and the buttermilk fried chicken. I've had better creamed spinach at other steakhouses, but this was good too. The sweet potato fries were just okay. The mac and cheese was mm mmm good - decadent! And as others have probably mentioned the butter toffee cake was SOOOO good!   I recommend Hank's for their attentive staff and good food."}
{"text":"Just does not get any better than this place.  Beats the sh** out of Morton's, Ruth's Chris or Del Frisco's.  Service, food quality and price (yes price!) are far superior than any of the chain steak houses.     Wine list is just awesome too.  (Screaming Eagle! Are you kidding me?) this is my new fav restaurant."}
{"text":"After reading the previous reviews, I was nervous about dining here. Let me assure you that there is nothing to worry about. The food is delicious, the drinks are on point, and the service is impeccable!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointing in every way!  It was a very busy Tuesday night. Our $150 bottle of wine was difficult to find by the sommelier. Waited 15 minutes for the salad to arrive. The couple at the table next to us (that had arrived after we sat down) were served a lot more quickly.  After an additional 40 minute wait for the entrée (a ribeye that wasn't cooked to a medium rare).  We will never return and I will make sure that I tell everyone about my horrible experience! There are too many wonderful steak houses in Las Vegas to ever go back to Hank's!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Service, Amazing cuisine, Awesome atmosphere. Great happy hour as well! 101 Martini menu!"}
{"text":"went to hanks last nite for the mothers day dinner buffet. absolutely disgusting, everything was cold, food on a buffet needs to be changed out by standard every 20 minutes; never happens but you have to be close not at this place some of the food had been there all nite. the staff was breaking down empty tables as potential diners were still coming and seated in the area. hopefully this place is better at their normal daily operation but skip the $90 buffet it stinks. one star to much"}
{"text":"This is one of my very favorite restaurants in all of Las Vegas! Fantastic steaks, plentiful drinks, friendly staff! I eat here every chance I can, and you should too!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. Great food, inviting ambiance, and amazing service. We had a large party and the staff never missed a beat. If you like carrot cake, they have the best ever! It is big, so bring friends and be prepared to share it!"}
{"text":"You have to try the chopped steak salad. Is truly to die for. Nothing like it anywhere else on  the planet."}
{"text":"Great place for Happy Hour! Lexy made us some great martinis. They have a huge selection of martinis to choose from. We also had a few appetizers,  which were very tasty.  Great atmosphere, with live music, great service and great food & drinks."}
{"text":"Great service, beautiful restaurant and the food was delicious. Love Hanks and love Green Valley Ranch Resort!"}
{"text":"Ordered the sliders, steak fries & hanks dirty. Hanks dirty Martin was On point with blue cheese olives  (3  for the Martin) Sliders were alright, slightly over cooked. Steak fries were BLAH, soggy but the sauce for them was good. 1/2 priced Martin's 5-7pm worth it! Service by Lahina & Brianna-they were great!!!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this steakhouse for many years,seen lots of people come and go and food was usually great. Last night my husband(who has a bad voice from a stroke) his best friend and myself went into the bar at 7:15. A new waitress came up to us and we all ordered-no drinks arrived /15 minutes later security comes to the table and says\"we heard you are drunk,you must leave\" the manager never showed up. The waitress never asked us if we were drunk-security comes in?we are all locals do our fair share of gambling at GVR and  hadn't had one drink yet! This was unprofessional and very embarrassing to my husband who is self conscious of his voice anyway and not really a drinker.a horrible scenario and the manager defiantly should have come to our table or done something not just called security. All three of us are chairman members and now none of our friends or ourselves will ever frequent this place again! No class-a very inexperienced manager...no wonder it's not busy anymore. Sorry hanks-you were our go to place........."}
{"text":"Amazing! Made a reservation for an early Valentines dinner. The place is beautiful, the service fantastic and the food amazing! The scallops were so good along with the garlic mashed potatoes and the creamed corn was to die for! I will definitely return for a special occasion, but honestly it felt so comfortable that I would come back for drinks at the bar on any given night."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food. Also , for an expensive restaurant the portions are great. Are there for the first time in October and I was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Seven months later, decided not to sit at the bar w/ the fruit flies if they were around.  Immediately, we were seated in the last room, furthest from the bar.  Service was ok, one guy was great, but not our server.  The GM kept passing us by, never came around to ask us how things were, but the manager did.  Fruit flies all the way back to this room, embarrassing to me still.   When GM Johnathan was here this was never an issue.  We were fanning large fruit flies away from our food.  Dad ordered a perfectly cooked steak & Mom a beautiful Salmon.  Thanks Chefs & for a delish Lobster Chowder.  I ordered my fav Hearts of Palm & my friend a Rock Shrimp.  Excellent salad.  The Rock Shimp is not my fav.  Love the Dijonaise w/ Pretzel Bread.    Shocking this bug issue has reached the back room showing me that no one cares seven months later about fixing the flies flying into drinks, let alone food.  Mind-boggling to me & no, not everywhere has a fruit fly issue as one manager told me.  Regulars can put five stars cause of location as this was once a fav of mine also & we get great deals & HH, but not worth it to me."}
{"text":"We have been here before and had a wonderful experience.  Today we were treated like garbage.  It was my wife's fiftieth birthday and we expected this to be the place to celebrated it.  We were treated to being seated a half hour after our reservation time.  After that our waiter introduced himself, never to be seen again.  He spent all of the time we there with a table of sixteen.  We were completely disregarded after that even though we order the most expensive Wagyu steaks on the menu.  We are about the most easy going customers there are, but were stunned by how poorly we were treated.  When we brought our displeasure to the server who was bringing us water, we finally got someone to pay attention to us.  Needless to say, it was a token effort at best and nothing improved.  I do not like to give negative feed back to anyone on any platform, but this is deserved."}
{"text":"Don't order the steak fries! They were a bit soggy. The sliders were good but I have had much better. The meat was a little over cooked.  Please DO have the Hank's Dirty Martini with Blues Cheese olives, of course! They have a 2 for 1 Happy Hour which made it all worth it!  Good ambience! Good servers."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place. I had very high hopes for this dinner. Co workers and friends have raved forever about the food. I was less than impressed. The lobster chowder was just ok. Thick and heavy (as expected) but not much lobster. There were 7 of us at dinner and everyone's steak and sides came out cold. When we sent it back the steaks weren't what we ordered.... medium went to medium well done, rare went to medium... etc. One of the guests at our table was Vegan due to food allergies and they didn't prepare the food in a proper Vegan way. There was no apology. When I got up to go to the bathroom and returned, my napkin was re folded. Ok. Expect it had black hair in the napkin. I'm blonde.... clearly not mine or anyone at my table. The service was mediocre. It's nice not to be rushed or to feel rushed but we sat down at 8 and didn't leave before 10:30.    If you're going to spend this amount of money you expect it to be perfect. Go to Maestros. This doesn't even compare.."}
{"text":"Perhaps I should give this place a 4, but it teeters between 4 and 5 stars for me.  Both times I went, I sat at the bar.  Service provided by the Asian male bartender with glasses and the the female bartender with blond hair was terrific.... attentive but not overbearing.    I've tasted:  - French onion soup - good, solid choice, but not the best I've ever had. - Crab cakes - to die for!  They were really juicy and plump with not much breading. - Caesar - first time was delicious, second time was over-dressed  - Artichoke salad - impressive presentation in an artichoke heart, but unfortunately, the leaves were not tender enough to eat. - Brocoli florets with hollandaise - incredible! - Charred sweet corn - Also surprisingly incredible.  It was so soft and sweet.  YUM.  I had wine the first time I went and it was good and reasonably priced.  There are some wines on the list that seem a bit overpriced, but other options for more price conscious people."}
{"text":"Happy Hour at Hank's Steakhouse at Green Valley Ranch Casino. Great food and great service. Then to add the moment we have Cali Tucker singing, amazing voice!!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic find!! Service, in restaurant was fabulous, attentive and friendly. We shared the halibut and got the hearts of palm salad and chopped salad..wow!! I would give this place a 5 star but service at the the bar was not friendly. It's ok to smile girls, not everyone is looking at your corset that is too tight. Smile, it pairs nicely with the $20 glass of wine I just ordered!"}
{"text":"If you want an elegant evening with fantastic food and spectacular martinis, this is your place. Be sure to go early for happy hour, the bar gets very crowded! It is slightly annoying that they regularly \"reserve\" spots at the bar for the favored customers, and sometimes they don't show up for over an hour+. Crowd martini favorites are the Cantaloupe and Pear...all half priced from 4-7. Happy hour food is served from 5-7, the tacos and prime rib sliders are to die for. Afterwards, head into the restaurant for a truly decadent experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I just love this place. Everything from food to service is amazing. This is our go to place and we live in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Please don't go here unless you love good food- hot women and some incredible piano playing. If you don't like this type of thing then go to the food court at the GVR! Awesome time, well worth the $$$$$!"}
{"text":"Bar is too crowded.  Too many \"saved\" seats while others stand.  Not very accommodating.  Good martini's.  Could be friendlier.  The servers are rude.  Could not be more disappointed."}
{"text":"Hanks did not disappoint one bit!   I had a party of 4 and everyone loved the start to finish.  Martini's, our crab cake appetizers, Caesars salad, AMAZING seafood tower entrees were their delicious steaks and Dover sole so tasty and nice size portions.  We also had very good sides.    We will be back!! Servers were awesome and the decor is so nice in there!  Great place for Henderson.  The musician that played in the bar he sounded EXCELLENT!!!  Love it"}
{"text":"The happy hour is now 4-7 which is great for half price martinis. The lump meat crab cocktail is phenom! Ask for crackers with it and eat the crab on crackers dressed with the cocktail and horseradish sauce ...YUM!  The servers in the bar area are incredibly attentive and wonderfully friendly; it's classy fining with warm service."}
{"text":"The service and food was amazing. We had the Chateaubriand for two and the mashed potatoes with horseradish for our entree.  We decided to start with the specialty Crab claw appetizer that consisted of 2 large crab claws; we didn't ask the price but assumed it would be reasonable ($25-$30).  When we got the bill and saw $99 for the 2 crab claws, we almost fell out of our booth.   Moral of the story - ask the price before you order something that is not on the menu!  Other than that, it was a great dinner and fun time!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Hanks for years, we love everything about it!!   The best selection of martinis.  Love the food!!  All the staff are very professional, and super sweet.   One of the best additions to the happy hour is Cali Tucker!!  Omg, she sings like an angel, she always makes our time at Hanks so memorable.  Love that Cali is so down to earth and treats to her amazing voice."}
{"text":"I don't treat myself to such a pricey meal often, especially when traveling for work, but I though when I'm in Vegas, why not?  I wasn't going to be spending money on the strip since we are in Vegas Light, so a good meal made sense.   We were able to get right in. The service was good, the drinks were even better, and the steak, well let's just say, uh yum-o. I ordered the 16oz Neiman Ranch New York Strip. I like my food dead, and even well done the steak was juicy and tender. They bring you out house made sauces for the steaks. The bernaise gets two thumbs up!  The bread basket was great and while the sides are pricey, the au gratin potatoes were so good. Save your $10 on the broccoli with hollandaise and put it toward the run Manhattan. That drink was solid.   This place is definitely worth the cost and the trip."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try their happy hour for months now.  Happy hour is only available at the bar or in the lounge area. They had every table but two in the lounge  and half of the entire bar reserved for a birthday party.  We waited 45 minutes for a spot to open up and then gave up and went to another restaurant in the hotel to eat. Who allows bar stools to be reserved? Seriously?! You don't have a private room they could have rented out? Will never even attempt to return to this restaurant again. Looked like it only catered to people over 60 anyhow."}
{"text":"Happy Hour at Hanks!  The girls and I stopped in for their happy hour since we've all heard great things about it.   You walk into their bar and lounge area.  It's decorated beautifully with many comfy seating all around.   During our visit here there was a guitarist playing ever so lightly which made for great cocktail music.    We decided to split their Mushroom and goat cheese tart.  Oh Yum.  So rich and creamy.  This isn't served with any bread for dipping but we received some without any issues.  We also split the chef's choice sliders.  On that particular day it was reuben sliders with sauerkraut.  Well, we respectfully requested them without the sauerkraut.  They were good but not great.  I'm hoping to try them again on a different slider option night.    Service here was good.  We didn't have any issues with drinks and refills.  There were a few different girls always checking on our table.  It was nice!  Yes, I will be back again!  Maybe for dinner next time.  :-)"}
{"text":"Martinis were great but great martinis alone aren't good enough.  A restaurant at this caliber should have bartenders that make eye contact and engage in good conversation..  Service was absolutely terrible.   The bartender never made eye contact.  Dropped off the menu and never came back.  Unfortunately we are very social people.  Our friends and colleagues respect and ask for our opinions.  We can not in good conscious recommend this place.  D- at best"}
{"text":"To say that my experience tonight was incredible doesn't do this place justice. To start the night off, Serena the hostess managed to get us in an hour earlier than expected (it was really busy but they had a cancellation) she was so lovely and sweet! Our servers were Claudio and Louis. I would highly recommend the cucumber martini (get it with the Hendrix gin instead of the vodka) and we ordered the two specials they had for the evening for our side dishes, the lobster bacon truffle mac and cheese (holy wow) and the truffle corn mash (even more holy wow) everything was amazing, all the service staff was even more amazing if that's even possible. Love love love!!"}
{"text":"Great place to meet Friends and their martinis are the best. The staff is exceptional and very attentive.  Being a local and frequent this place often, I do see some inconsistencies at times, but they try their best. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at Hank's.  We came for our 11th anniversary, I guess I told them the occasion when I was making the reservation. From the host to the Sommelier to the waiters all wished us not only a Happy Anniversary, but Happy 11th Anniversary!  I always liked the ambiance of this restaurant.  There is glass fire places, several chandeliers, views of steel and glass wine cellar, swanky sofa-like booths as well as tables with nice big chairs for each person.   For a special touch, they seated us at a booth made actually for 4 people so that we could sit side by side.   Service was incredibly attentive and comfortable, yet formal. However, I like a Sommelier that tells you about the wine you just ordered,  this one was silent and very stiff when presenting the wine.   Last time I was here, our Sommerlier was awesome and gave us info about the wine we were about to enjoy!  Anyway, Hank's has a beautiful and extensive wine collection.  Take advantage.  One thing that was interesting and I liked was they ask if you want a bread basket or if you want to \"save room\" for your meal. My husband order the lobster chowder.  I took a bite, it was creamy yet still had nice size chunks of seafood and vegetables.  While excellent it was not extraordinary...I make a corn chowder that has a similar flavor profile.   While meant to compliment the steak, I asked for the foie gras as my appetizer.  They happily obliged my request, without looking at me strangely.  OMG a nice 3 inch slice of heaven that I rarely get to eat anymore.    We shared a steakhouse salad and each got our own 22 oz bone-in ribeye.  Beautifully cooked to medium-rare, as requested. Sad thing was we were looking forward to a Tomahawk Steak for two, which they no longer offer.  Nonetheless, some of the best steak in the Vegas area.   So stuffed and gathering that we don't eat grains they brought us two tuxedo dressed chocolate covered strawberries as a complimentary dessert. Very nice, and that was in addition to the little sweets they bring with your check.   While we normally just celebrate our anniversary with a simple meal out, Hank's made our 11th very memorable. Everyone said good bye and Happy 11th Anniversary, once again."}
{"text":"In celebration of changes and playing so much at Green Valley Ranch I was setup to go to dinner at Hank's.  The atmosphere although darker is very rich with light and decorations. The minute you walk in you are facing an amazing bar with a double glass cooled wine units. The piano was playing and the glass rock fireplace rightfully placed up high was well going. Sure its 109 degrees in Las Vegas right now but when your in this air conditioned heaven you forget all about it.   Reservations at 8PM, after only a couple minutes at the bar I was escorted to my table where I placed my order for the Caesar salad which was topped off with freshly ground pepper. Skipping the appetizer I went straight to the main course choosing Salmon with a side of foie grois.  Maker's Mark on the rocks accompanied my dinner and it was the perfect match.   The salmon was a little plain but perfectly cooked. And they offered toppings and sauces I could have chosen from but none were recommended to me. This was my second time dining at hank's."}
{"text":"Hank's is AMAZING in every way. Our service team was witty, charming and full of personality. They definitely made our night! I mentioned that I like Moscow Mules and they recommended a mule that's not on the menu. It had fresh, muddled jelapenos....it was even better than the original we ordered!   The food was phenomenal as well. The crab cocktail and sweet corn are both MUST HAVES! Our filets were cooked to absolute perfection, respectively. I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very upbeat and swanky.  We go for happy hour occasionally and the half price martinis are strong and delicious.  The wonton tacos are so freaking good.  The place is usually hopping so be sure to make a reservation or get to the bar early!"}
{"text":"Rarely travel to Henderson, but I think I have a reason to now! One of the BEST local dinning experiences! Believe it or not, Fried Chicken is hidden signature dish! Thanks again, Andres!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I have to say we started off great and went downhill. Roger our waiter, seemed overwhelmed as the dining room got filled up. Items were forgotten, yes mostly mine. We are entertaining an out of town guest, this was a bit embarrassing.   The best was one he lumbered over with a pathetic Birthday something, and walked away - leaving us without any silverware. I ordered cappuccino. It was lovely that the bus boy came over after my friends got their coffee and tea and said \"Roger forgets our Cappuccino machine is broken.\"   He brought over a plate of 3 tiny desserts to make up for it.   Not impressed. Back in the day, they just seemed to care more.   Step it up."}
{"text":"We had just received a coupon for Hank's in the mail - $25 off a $50 dinner. Sounded too good to pass up. On walking in, the hostess station is by the front door. On showing us to our table, she informed us that we would have 3 servers (yes, she told us the names but I only retained one of the names). Our main server, Brian, came by almost immediately to get our drink order and answer any questions. Shortly after we ordered, they brought a basket of breads. Presentation was outstanding. The pretzel bread is a little disappointing, but the other breads in the basket were excellent. My wife and I decided to share the Kansas City Prime Steak with a side of pan roasted mushrooms. They cooked the steak to perfection, medium just the way we like it. However, the taste of the steak was disappointing. A $63 steak should melt in your mouth, not make you worry about a choking hazard. The side of mushrooms was excellent. The ambience and the service were definitely upscale. We even had a celebrity sighting while we were there. But there are too many upscale steakhouses in Las Vegas that prepare their steaks better than this at this price point. I don't think I'll be coming back, even with a $25 coupon."}
{"text":"Nice NY strip and wine selection. Noise level is high as well as prices but you get what you pay for in Vegas. Plan on spending $75-$100 per person plus drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for an office dinner party....  First off the place is beautiful. But don't feel the stressful need to dress up as there were a lot of people in jeans and shorts!  Appetizers: Fried calamari was FANTASTIC!!!! the little pit of the Poke i tried was very good as well.  I wasn't too fond of the crab cakes but everyone else seemed to love them.  Dinner:  First off... it took almost 45 min for our food to arrive at the table... A majority of us had the bison steak.  It was good... but wasn't the best bison i have had. a little disappointed with that.  took a little piece of someones fried chicken and OH MY GOODNESS was it good!  Side dishes:  I personally liked the au gratin potatoes the best! very good.  everyone else loved the creamed corn... it was good but i'm normally not a fan of it in the first place.  the mac and cheese was good... nothing to rant over.  mashed potatoes were very good.... but i like the au gratin better!  the asparagus was under cooked and hard.  was very bland as well and just wasn't worth the $12 or whatever overpriced amount it was.  all in all it was a great dinner... worth a try!"}
{"text":"This place is Uber expensive. I take my wife here once a year with some high roller friends that get everything on comp. Otherwise I wold never step foot in here. The atmosphere is very Bling. A unique gas fire place compliments the room amongst crystal chandeliers. Live Piano Music can be heard in the Bar at Happy Hours into dinner time. The food well. I never could justify a 50 dollar steak on a plate. I'm not blown away by steak house cuisine. Never was. But I guess you can say its the best money can buy. Our host  orders a bunch of things up an down the menu and the tab can get into the thousands.  I was never impressed by any of the dishes. Steak Plate, portions small, Drinks are on the other hand real good. The Wine List is Pro casino style. They got all the names and almost all the bottles that are currantly desired."}
{"text":"Beware of this place.  Staying at GVR. Made reservation. They lied when we got there and said they could not take reservations.  Thanks for ruining our evening Corina.  There are better stake houses to go in Henderson that won't lie and will take us. Thanks again Corina for providing us with the worse customer service and given us dirty looks."}
{"text":"I love Hanks ! The environment is very elegant and beautiful and the food is fabulous. My overall experience was amazing .. Cocktails are spectacular,as well as the food ! I can't say enough ... Wld recommend to any of my out of town clients and my local friends ."}
{"text":"Dinner was amazing ! Service was on point definitely will be back very soon. Food was flavorful. Drinks were smooth and server was delightful."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Delicious steak and vegs. Will go again... Real soon. Wonderful for locals and or visitors especially after day at pool. :)"}
{"text":"Love Hanks! Always a great meal, great service, and the martini's for happy hour are a great deal!"}
{"text":"Yep, five years later and still like it! Delicious food, solid fine dining restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service but a bit pricey.  Great for a special occasion or if money is no object. The steaks are tender and flavorful.  I would give 5 stars but $11 for a baked potato is a little much.  Still worth a try."}
{"text":"Decided to have a last minute date night and didn't want to wander off too far so we headed to gvr. I have never been to hanks but had heard about it numerous times. We were greeted immediately and sat promptly, entrance is through their lounge/bar which could definitely use some sound barriers but nothing alarming. Once seated the service never slacked at all so that alone derserves the stars. We opted out of the appetizers but we got all of our food to share. Our server Claudio was super helpful with the menu and extremely sociable. We ordered the 22oz ribeye medium and it was cooked perfect and melted in my mouth, I don't eat steak often at all maybe a couple times a year so it was a nice treat to truly get a good tasting steak. Our sides were green beans with almonds and potatoes at gratin and both accompanied our steak just right. Dessert we got their house favorite- a sour cream coffee cake with warm toffee sauce and creme fraise ice cream on the side. It was great too, there's nothing that was less than par here st all! We definitely were under dressed going but kind of knew that would be the case so I was prepped to feel a little out of place but I was surprised to see numerous people whether casually dressed. I personally wouldn't show up as casual again but I was happy to not feel as uncomfortable as I was expecting. Ambience is good, food is good, service is good. Can't ask for more.  Price range sharing a meal was about $60 a person with salad, entrees, sides, and cocktail."}
{"text":"For being inside a casino off the strip this place is wonderful! Staff is incredibly kind and accommodating, but more over the ambiance is beautiful. They offer a wonderful selection of fresh breads, all were wonderful. We tried the house chopped salad which was good but slightly over dressed. I had the tuna poki tacos which were light and delicious. We also tried their jumbo lump crab cocktail. The quality of the crab was impressive. The piano player and the people that positioned themselves by him were somewhat annoying. They kept interrupting their set and letting other people hop onto the piano to play what ever diddy they felt like and talked loudly about working on projects together in the future. I dunno, call me a princess but in a gorgeous setting like that I love the idea of just a lovely soft touch of live music to amplify the space. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed and will be back soon."}
{"text":"My husband I have been to Hanks a few times and each time we have loved it. In 2009 we went for our 1 yr wedding anniversary and again the food and service were excellent. I love there cream corn and steaks. At the end of the meal they brought us a mini cheesecake with a small white chocolate 'Happy Anniversary on top. It also tasted great. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family. Thank you Hanks for making our anniversary special."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Nice bar, good entertainment, good drink list and excellent food and service every time!"}
{"text":"Top notch steak house and beautifully decorated! Staff was friendly and offered great suggestions! Everyone is made to feel like a VIP while dining here!"}
{"text":"this was our \"fine dining\" group dinner location for a friends bachelor party.  the service here is amazing.  i believe our server was claudio.  he and his team were more than attentive without being overbearing.  most of us either had the ribeye or kc steak.  the steaks were cooked to near perfection.  as previous reviews have stated, the cream corn is a MUST have.  claudio said it was their best seller for the past 8 years!  i can definitely see why.. and u must, too!  the only downer was dessert.  some butter rum cake thing.. disgusting.  u know how u look at a menu and think, \"oh, that sounds good..\"  yea, it wasn't.  i hope they take it off their menu.  the cake was dry and the butter rum left me that \"wdf is this?  why would you make me eat this?\" feeling.  if you have to splurge a bit, this is the place to go.  good service, good food.. eh, on dessert.  our bill for 9 people was around $1100 after tip.  def will eat there again"}
{"text":"Didn't hate it, could have been better, disappointed that it wasn't.  Walking into this restaurant, though, is like a 5-star experience. It's lush and glitzy and you feel like you're in a much more expensive restaurant than you are. The chandeliers are like dripping diamonds, fantastically beautiful.  So, now that I've gotten past the best part. Onto the drinks and food.   My boyfriend and I stopped in here because we live in Green Valley and had never been here. I was excited it was so close. Sadly, my excitement was short lived.   The service, to start, was incredible. They had two waiters serving us and a woman who brought our drinks. Mind you, it was on a Sunday afternoon and it was almost dead. I am not sure the service would have been as good had it been busier.    So, I order the Koi martini. It tasted just like a mango, with sugar around the rim and a really full body to it, it was heavenly! I also tried another one, it was blue (I've forgotten the name, I apologize) and it was just so-so. I ended up having another Koi, I loved it so much!  We then ordered oysters on the half shell. They were nice and briny and cold. I couldn't have asked for better, even as small as they were. They were delicious!  For our entree we ordered the Tomahawk Chop, medium rare. It came out cooked perfectly. They split it and even boxed the bone for our dogs. Nice! Unfortunately, the steak was cold. I mean, bone-chilling cold. I sent mine back and it came back out with half the steak I sent back to the kitchen. It just disappeared! In its place were cold, tiny tomatoes. Oh, thank you! I had a side of foie gras as well and it was so sweet as to be inedible. What? Don't spend your money on it, it lacked richness and depth. It tasted like a dessert (and I NEVER pass on foie gras!).   We also ordered as a side, sautéed spinach. It was also a little on the cold side and tasted a little underdone. I know, spinach, right? It was just so-so. I wouldn't suggest ordering it, oh, ever. Yuck.  We passed on dessert as we didn't want to set ourselves up for further disappointment.   All in all I'd say that I'll try it again just to see if it was a bad day. I hope it was because the place has a lot going for it."}
{"text":"Note: I have yet to actually dine here. All of my experiences have been appetizers and drinks at the bar.  Hank's is a classy, but not stuffy, steak restaurant at Green Valley Ranch. And they have an awesome happy hour. It's a great place for grabbing cocktails and appetizers. On my most recent visit, we did a bottle of wine, calamari, fries, and lobster bisque to share amongst us. All of it was delicious. The bartender was friendly and attentive. And on a Friday night, the bar area was actually pretty empty.  All in all, great drinks and great eats await you here. And there's some great deals too during happy hour."}
{"text":"Great Service, Great selection of steaks from Kobe to organic grass fed. Must try the lobster chowder. Great happy hour and live music everyday. Wonderful date night."}
{"text":"I think our waiter described it best when he called this evening's meal \"a disaster.\"  We were seated slightly early for our 7pm reservation, but that's where the good restaurant karma stopped. Our salads didn't come until past 7.30--apparently the salad chef was really backed up. In all that time, no bread (or explanation) was offered. Finally my diabetic grandfather had to ask for a bread basket. The salad was delivered without dressing (which took an additional five minutes to get), anchovies (which never came at all), and with different ingredients than what we'd been promised (including blue cheese, which makes me sick).   Our steaks didn't come until 8.10, and the French fries we'd ordered didn't make it for another 10 minutes. The steaks were good, although mine was medium at one end, medium rare in the middle, and rare at the other end. A problem with the grill, perhaps?  For whatever reasom, it was upsetting in an expensive filet.  Our waiter clearly felt bad, and tried to make it up to us with two free deserts that we didn't want and my grandfather couldn't eat. Also, neither the cheesecake nor the carrot cake were all that good. In spite of our waiter's insistence that the kitchen was at fault, it wasn't just the kitchen--in the two hours we were sitting there, no one offered us refills on water, and I was brought a regular soda instead of diet.   My grandmother said that if this was her first time here, she wouldn't go back. It *was* my first time, and I *won't* be back."}
{"text":"Top of line service with a menu to please anyone. The lobster soup had very generous portions of lobster. The wet aged ribeye is the best steak, perfectly cooked and season well. The sides were all amazing such as the cream corn and lobster mac & cheese in truffle oil. Can't forget the massive Australian lobster tail that was perfect and buttery. The inside of the restaurant and bar are very elegant with a comfortable ambiance."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour. All the martinis were half off and we liked the Koi and dirty martinis.  The food that we tried was disappointing.   We had the beef on weck, which was ONE very thin slice of meat (rib eye?) on a very thick bun, came as 3 sliders per order.  Very dry and bland.   We also tried the duck poutine. The duck cracklings on top were very chewy and the gravy was not flavorful at all.   I rounded up to 4 stars for good service and good restaurant ambiance, especially since we didn't try the restaurant's steak menu."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Hanks! We came here to celebrate our anniversary. There was some glitch with our reservation, but it was quickly rectified, and we were seated shortly.  The decor is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! Comfy velvet covered curved booths, lovely chandeliers, a fire display- everything was gorgeous.  Service was also very smooth and friendly, with a few different servers assisting us throughout the night.    We sampled a couple of the martinis, which were refreshing but packed quite the punch!! I had the Koi, which had a mango flavor, and my husband had the Cucumber/Gin martini, which was like a mojito, but not as sweet.  The food was definitely top notch as well.  We decided not to get steaks, but instead, I got the shrimp cocktail and the crab cakes, while my husband got the fried chicken.  We also shared an order of the yams.  Everything was delicious! The shrimp were huge, and the cocktail sauce yummy.  The crab cakes were light and delicate, full of crab, with just enough filler to keep them together. My husband REALLY enjoyed his fried chicken.  Although it was white meat, he said it wasn't dry at all,  the batter wasn't too heavy, and the sage gravy was very tasty.  We both enjoyed the baked yam, which came with a cinnamon-brown sugar butter.  They brought us a complimentary creme brullee with berries for dessert, which was the perfect ending to the meal.    We will definitely return to Hanks!"}
{"text":"The greatest dining experience I've ever had was at Hank's.  The beef is prime grade and the chefs there know what to do with it!  I've been there a few times, so I know it's not a fluke.  I don't have much time to sing all of Hank's praises, but I can tell you that the ambiance is modern and swanky.  The heirloom tomato salad drew rave reviews from my buddies.  My filet mignon and lobster tail was outstandingly prepared.  My brother's porterhouse for two (and yes, the kid took out the 40oz beast by himself!) was equally outstanding.  You've seen all the other reviews.  There are only two things left to do...1) save up your money, cuz the bill won't be for the faint of heart...and 2) GO HUNGRY!!!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant. The food was excellent. I enjoyed the Ahi, regulars often order the seafood. The waitress was very personable. Beware of the mile high cake it is also a mile wide and RICH."}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable meal at Hank's.  The food was excellent and everything was prepared wonderfully.  From the Steakhouse Salad, Crab Cakes, T-Bone for 2 and sides...all delicious.  The drinks were equally awesome.  My rant, however, would be the service.  We came here a month ago and sat in the main dining room.  Again, food was awesome but service so-so.  They forgot my birthday dessert but we were full anyways so it wasn't a big deal, just disappointing.  This time, we sat in the bar area to hear the live music.  Atmosphere not as romantic as it was crowded and noisy...but it was to be expected.  No biggie.  Our waitress was nice and helpful when around, but most of the time...WHERE DID SHE GO?  She was too busy helping the party near us with cocktails.  We were the least of her worries, or at least it felt that way.  Everything was sloooow.  Spacing between appetizers, main course and dessert was T O O FAR A P A R T!    Other than that, we really did like the food and music.  Hopefully the third times a charm, should we frequent Hank's again!  :-)"}
{"text":"Great place! Those pig wings tho!!! Great service and beautiful room. The street corn, au gratin potatoes were perfect. Our steaks we also cooked to perfection.  5 stars in all categories!!!"}
{"text":"Eh had way bigger expectations for this place. Great martinis and service. That's about all."}
{"text":"Love this place! Anniversary dinner with my husband. They treat you like royalty and the food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!  I've been going to GVR for years now and every time I walk by Hank's I always think to myself, \"How does that place stay in business?\"  Little did I know that the joke is on me.  The food was out of this world!  The service was impeccable.  The attention detail was superb.  The salad plate was freezing cold, the steak plate was piping hot, the side dishes were to die for, the Steakhouse salad was out of this world, the peppercorn and horseradish dipping sauce were heavenly and I can just go on and on and on!  This is a must eat for locals and a VERY STRONG recommendation for travelers in Las Vegas.  Vegas has a ton of Steakhouse's but this one is truly special."}
{"text":"One if my favorite places for a good steak in Vegas.  I always get it Oscar style, big lumps of crab on top.  Haven't had anything I don't like there.  Seafood platters and the many sides are delicious.  Especially nice if you get to sit near the entertainment.  Our last visit there they had a guy playing guitar.  He played a wide range if songs that we all knew.  It was just really nice and added to the already cool atmosphere if the place."}
{"text":"Walking in we notice the live music, great singer. The interiors were beautiful large chandeliers, fireplace, walls of wine.  Really romantic setting for me. We chose a bottle of Duckhorn Merlot really enjoyed it.  To my surprise the Canadian oysters were delicious!  He ordered surf and turf and I had the bone in ribeye. Ribeye is my favorite cut because of the marbling. I actually liked the flavor of the filet a lot better and texture was perfect.  The lobster was perfect and served with candle melted butter. Service from aerating the wine to never empty glasses, as soon as we ate the last bite of each course the plates were cleared and the next arrived. This dinner made it as one of my favorite dates!"}
{"text":"We went for our third anniversary. My husband requested a booth and it was just breathtaking in the dining room with the lovely chandeliers and relaxed ambiance. My lemon drop was a bit strong, but I am a drink wimp. Everything we ordered was fabulous. Our three servers greeted us by name, and knew of our anniversary. We had the surf and turf king crab legs with the petit filet medium \"plus\" since I done want it quite so pink and love it a bit warmer. The crab legs were the best I have had in years, served with its own drawn butter warmer. My husband went with the bone in New York and was quite happy. We got the \"most popular\" sides of creamed corn and potatoes au gratin and they were both great. There was so much food we ended up taking about half home (of course we finished the crab legs there). They even brought out three strawberries dipped in white and dark chocolate with a candle for our 3rd anniversary. We were very pleased with the food,  the staff, and the ambiance!"}
{"text":"Renee was our bartender and she was amazing! The customer service was on point. From getting us more drinks, to recommendations to lastly being very polite and social during happy hour.   We came for happy hour to try a few appetizers and get our martini on. At 21 I had tried a martini at a steak house and hated it. Tasted like gasoline. Here I had decided I was going to try one of their beautifully flavored martinis. I mean, why not? They're known for great one so I might as well. Of course it slipped my mind to take pictures of our martinis. Renee poured them and they were strong and tasty. Mine was a peach apple martini and Jason got a pear. Both were delicious and loved them. I guess there is a martini lover inside of me!  The appetizers are pretty large. I want to call them mini entrees. The first was the oysters Rockefeller. Talk about sweet salty and savory goodness. It was a fried oyster with drizzled bbq sauce on top of a bed of pancetta creamed spinach. I could have order four more of those. Next we went with the Lobster Gougeres. It was little puffed biscuits stuffed with lobster and topped with cheesy sauce and gravy sauce contraption. Hard to describe this one. I feel this one was very southern tasty yet just a tad too salty. Jason told me the type of cheese used is a salty cheese and I would have known that if I was familiar with the cheese. Oops! Sorry. Lastly we had to get the braised beef rib. I mean, this is a steak house so there beef must be out of this world right? Dead on! The braised beef was fall off the bone tender. Flavor packed as of it had been marinating in a bed of spices and sauces it's whole damn life. The reduction sauce was mouth watering. It was laid upon the puréed mash potatoes creating a killing duo. The carrot, onion and other veggie were tasty too. I almost felt like fighting Jason for the last bite. We even debated ordering a second.   Do yourself a favor. Stop here for happy Hour and try the menu. You'll love it like we did.  we are already planning our second trip for a dinner trial."}
{"text":"4 stars for the sommelier service, knowledge and approach.  2 1/2 for service in general.  2 stars for the food :( , the steaks were bland and not a PRIME quality as they advertised on the menu.  Side dishes were just ok.  Best part of the meal wine selection and fried Oreos for dessert.  For a $170 a head should be a way better quality meal.  I guess for us who live in Henderson, got to do the drive to the strip. (Sad)  Not going back."}
{"text":"Best martini bar in Las Vegas.  We have dined here many times and have always had superior service.  The martini menu is quite extensive.  Try the Elvis Presley or German Chocolate cake martini.  The steaks are always perfect and the toffee butter cake is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"What a nightmare! Hostess was diffident, \"You are ten minutes early, why don't you have something at the bar,\" except there was no place to sit and the Happy Hour crowd was LOUD!  Kinda like Super Bowl Touchdown LOUD!  So we waited outside.  So we were escorted to a booth where the hostess grasped the table and slid the entire table out, blocking the walkway so four of us could be seated, after which she slid the table back into position, pinning us in like rats, so we were stuck, four people in a six-person booth SHOUTING at each other because of the Super Bowl crowd noise.  I spent the entire evening squished into a space where my butt was forward and my upper torso was leaning back, I couldn't lean forward because the table was against my stomach and had to lay a napkin on my chest to catch the pieces of food that fell from my fork as it was elevated to my mouth, and I couldn't hear the conversation of my companions, so I sat there smiling like a Cheshire Cat amidst the noise.   The salads were obviously pre-made and held in cold storage and were very bland.  The waiter was surly, had a very \"Get in-eat-get out\" attitude.  The tower of seafood we ordered was kinda \"meh;\" the accompanying cocktail sauces tasted like store-bought and were amateurish.   Some people we knew were in the booth next to us and we noticed they complained about their steak and watched the matre'd bring them each some appeasement wine.  We started laughing when we noticed the party of four across from us obviously complained because there was a small commotion after which they also received four glasses of the same appeasement wine.  When the waiter brought our check he made a comment about poor me being squished into the booth, grasped the table and moved it into position, after which my buddy seated opposite me said, \"Gee, I was wondering why I had to lean forward to eat.\"  Duhhhhhh!   We will never be back."}
{"text":"My husband's second favorite steakhouse and the best in Henderson. Selection of cuts and fresh ingredient menu items is impressive. They stick to their staples on the menu which I truly appreciate as a local customer. Always go there for stuffed portobello mushroom side, Mac and cheese and sweet potato fries. They create dishes by season and considering heirloom tomatoes are in right now - their appetizer heirloom tomato salad is to die for. The French fry cone is big and delicious and (according to my husband) cuts of filet and New York are the best and always perfectly seasoned. Cuts come all carte which was expected but there is a nice personal, perhaps local touch to events and customers. On Valentine's Day all ladies were receiving beautiful long roses before the exit as well as chocolates at the end of their meal. Mike is my usual server there and he's so professional, very knowledgeable and accommodating to my specific and my husband plain and simple approach to the west emmmneeds as well as my kid's. The wine menu is impressive although not the cheapest, and I wouldn't expect mark ups on certain wine bottles this high at a Henderson steak house. Wine by the glass selection though is very pleasing as there is almost every grape offered on the wine list available by the glass as well. New York Cheesecake on dessert menu is another winner in my eyes, just traditional without excessive use of strawberries or sauce, with fresh secret ingredient graham crust which reminds me a little bit of the way European cheesecake is made as it's not too sweet, and every bite just melt the sweet cream cheese in your mouth with very subtle accent of strawberries and graham, and a touch of fresh made whipped cream... The relaxing ambiance suits romantic dinners and moments when you just want to get away from loud and crazy environment of casino and most steakhouses on a weekend such as STK which ultimately transforms to almost a night club on a Saturday night, with very tasty but loud dinner possibilities ;) Hank's is by far one of our favorite spots to hang out in Henderson. Bread basket one of my favorite in the valley too and always gets updated with new baker's/pastry chef's creations... Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Not really sure what's happening at Hanks. I do know it's not good.  We have been about a half a dozen times since my original review always great. Expensive but it is considered a high end steak house. With that said I will begin with the new butter offering I though it just had a drizzol of oil and some cracked pepper ok I put some on my bread it was bread with what was pure salt. Could not taste anything but salt. Asked the buser for some plain butter when he came back I asked him what was on the butter? Some type of special Hawaiian island salt. He smiled, I said do you hear this request for plain butter a lot he gave me the knowing nod. This would not have been an issue if they had served both and explained the salted oily butter. My husband and I started with crab cocktail it was good kinda hard to mess that up except the creamy mustard sauce served along side the very spicy cocktail sauce was like dipping your crab in mustard not as I remembered. We split a steak house salad. It was ice cold not chilled more like it had been sitting in the fridge since early afternoon it was over dressed and mushy but what really annoyed me was the brown mush of avocado it was disgusting we each had a few bites before the forks went down.  The buser took them away you could pretty much tell we did not eat them. Nobody came over to ask if everything was alright. I have a feeling instead of making them fresh to order they are now preparing them in the afternoon and putting them in the fridge unacceptable. Entree we ordered prime rib we have had the prime rib here before and enjoyed it. We did notic they no longer offer the queen and king cuts. I would get the queen and my husband would get the king now it's a flat 16oz which with mine I would doubt even came close to that. When asked how we would like it we we were apprehensive to ask for mediumwell because a lot of times it comes back so well done it's like eating your shoe. Our waitress assured us she would talk to the chef and let them know we would like it lightly pink. Hahaha like the bottom of my shoe the pink had gone long ago. It was tasty. I ate the tender outside first when the waitress came to check and ask how it was cooked I showed her my overly well done prime rib she offered to redo it. nope we are just gonna finish up. check please. It was not worth the money this time. I'm so disappointed because this is so close to our house. Really the only good thing we ain't were our potatoes. Baked and a sweet. We brought our shoe meat prime rib home to the puppy he loved it. The 2 stars were for the staff. I feel like we were ripped off. We will never go back. Hanks which was once a fave is now a PASS."}
{"text":"Pretty legit steakhouse. Needs an extended happy hour."}
{"text":"4/5 because food was good, but a little expensive.  But typical for Vegas.  We have eaten here about 4 times.  I love when they have a live singer or guitar player at the bar."}
{"text":"Yelp 2017 100 Challenge: 2017 Review 46/100  A very extinguished steak house in a non tourist area of Las Vegas. Hanks provides a classy but intimidate atmosphere, which their beautiful chandeliers and their live piano music. The food is pricey, but the foods served were good and the service even better. This place is the fancy type of place that asks you whether you would like to drink sparkling water or flat water for the water glass, next to your wine glass. A lovely environment with good service.  I ordered the petite filet mignon (~$50) and it was truly petite! As a small woman, even I was surprised at how small the steak was, especially for the price. But it was very good and plenty of food with the sides that we ordered. But next time, I probably wouldn't order the petite filet mignon, but something bigger, especially since they are around $50-80.   Tips: -The sides that you order come in large portions so they are perfect to share at the table! Don't worry about not having enough food!  I would definitely return here again!"}
{"text":"Definitely not the best steak house I have ever been to... and they are said to be #1 in Henderson. Usually, you cannot go wrong eating at nice restaurants in casinos but we will not be rushing back here. The money paid would have been better spent elsewhere for the food and service. There were very long lags and even getting a menu took a very long time. It is the type of place you would want to linger and enjoy everything but the wait for everything was ridiculous. I like my filet steak rare and it was way overcooked to the medium side. They eventually corrected it but I ended up watching everyone eat their steaks. The other big thing is that the sides were stone cold - the garlic mashed and the asparagus. I was dining with non-picky type people and even they sent these back. The mushrooms braised in red wine were funky and a few of us were feeling these later into the next day. What was delicious was the starter - lobster chowder. SO good. Crab cakes not bad. And the table bread - very good. There is a very extensive wine list and you can get many good ones by the glass for a decent price. The ambiance was very nice. Classy. On a busy evening, they were able to bump up our reso to be seated a bit earlier so we appreciated that. The bill was a hefty one and there was zero compensation for the cold food and overdone steak. By the way, the steaks, at least mine had no seasoning. They need to step up their game! No next time, sorry Hank's!"}
{"text":"One of the better Happy Hours in town (although it used to be even better before they recently changed the Happy Hour food menu).  Solid Martini's, good looking but slightly standoffish bar area wait staff (smile yet gentle heel in the neck vibe here) - old cheese plate on the happy hour food menu used to be spectacular, now it is merely ok."}
{"text":"The steaks are good the atmosphere is nice for green valley. You might as well go to the strip where you'll get better service for the same price"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour and the bar. Those gets five stars.  Live music, nice cocktails and upscale.  Food while good, is just ridiculously overpriced. Even by Strip standards it's a bit pricey and this is a locals casino.  Dock it one star for that"}
{"text":"2 stars because the service is too casual for a upscale restaurant and the food is not outstanding for the price.   i mean to say the servers are not very dignified or well trained. in spite of there poor service i tipped them very well because i am a dignified customer. Restaurant is clean. The girls at the front are very helpful. Nothing much to write about the ambience as nothing is quite exceptional other than beautiful chandeliers all over the places. Server started to called me buddy, as if we are neighbors. that behavior belongs to smaller restaurants. I accept i did not order my prime rib right, but the correction made by the server is not professional enough. It's like pointing me out as if i dont know nothing about eating steak. Food is dropped on our table as if the other side of the restaurant is caught on fire. There is no gentle placement of the food on the table. Again they behave very casually. They should remember we pay for the ambience and service ethics too. We are party of three people and the table we sat at is quite big. Servers lack minimum common sense to bring in individual sauce cups instead they just left large sauce containers in the middle and we struggled to stretch across the table to dip meat. I have eaten at so many upscale restaurants so can easily differentiate .  we ordered 3 entrees , i ate Prime Rib and i will review about what i ate.  30% of the prime rib is filled with Fat. i like it but just saying. Beginning 10 bites are superb and then after chewy part starts. seriously prime rib suddenly turns into a chewing gum.  Not sure why the same experience did not last until the end. meat dipping sauces (4 different kinds) are so good, i recommend trying them all and stick with what you like the most. I personally liked Peppercorn , Wine based, garlic based sauce.  Huge Prime Rib portion, i ate 70% and packed 30% for my puppies. Overall food experience is better than service.    If you have money, Go ahead give it a try.  If you experienced fine dining earlier then think before you pick this place. You may not experience similar hospitality . Try it if you never experienced fine dining earlier , it will help you for comparision purpose.  Thanks for reading my review."}
{"text":"We went on a busy Thursday night and had three fabulous waiters all to serve us! We had oysters, filets, and dessert aka we where there for a while. Our drinks were always full, our plates taken away, and the manager even stopped by a few times. Love the atmosphere and the decor inside the restaurant (only have been to the bar)! Suggest you come here for a night out!"}
{"text":"This place is 5-star all the way. My husband discovered it on The Food Network. It's located in a suburban area, so I was a little skeptical when we pulled in. Man was I surprised when we walked in. The decor was top notch and upscale.   We ordered the 48oz Tomahawk, because it was featured on The Food Network and it was what made my husband want to try this place out. This thing was huge! It could easily feed 4 people. We order it medium rare and it was cooked to perfection!   I'm really picky about my dirty martini and only order one from places that I know make them perfectly, so I got a little adventurous and decided to try theirs. So glad I did. Their dirty martini was the smoothest I've ever had! So, if you love a dirty martini, you have got to have one at Hank's.  If you're in Vegas and are willing to go off the beaten path, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Five stars for service and ambiance but less than stellar on the price point and the seasonings.  We shared a 22 oz ribeye and forgot to order the Gorgonzola topping.  Our fault but you would think they would then be sure to add something to the meat.  While it was buttery soft the flavor was lacking.  This is a steak house first and foremost and I expected the steak to be tremendous, it wasn't.  The drinks were good but again at a price I would avoid most times.  The service was very attentive with multiple waiters checking on us all of the time.  We had the kitchen sink salad, again ok but nothing to write home about.  The mushroom side was good as we're all of the sides we tried.  Overall, really not worth the price.  Why GVR sees themselves able to charge strip prices is beyond me. Had it not been a celebration for someone I can't see coming back.  I go for the food, the setting is not something I want to pay a lot extra for.  I can get two good Henderson steak dinners, better seasoned for the same money.  If you are more interested in the setting, the service and having a long, leisurely dinner then Hanks might be perfect for you."}
{"text":"This USED to be THE place to go in Henderson...now, not so much.  We hadn't been in about a year and the \"state of Stations\" is clearly taking a toll.  While the prices are still high and the service good, the food has definitely gone down hill.  We started with a drink and a $14 shrimp cocktail, which was tasty, but consisted of 3 average sized shrimp.   We split a cob salad...it was ok.  We each had a $20 glass of Duck Horn Merlot (can't go wrong with this wine) ...husband ordered fried chicken, which IS a treat at Hanks. He had scalloped potatoes and green beans on the side... salty.   I ordered the special of halibut and scallops with mashed potatoes and special sauce, $50.  While savoring my wine, I looked forward to enjoying the nice presentation of seafood placed at our table. ...and after a couple bites, I realized it was terribly fishy, not fresh and overly salty.  I couldn't eat it, so I shared hubby's chicken and sides.   The manager did take the dish back and not charge for it.  We ordered another glass of wine and dessert.  When the check arrived, they had also covered dessert, which was a nice gesture.  But the check was still pretty steep. I overheard a conversation with the manager and a couple seated next to us as well.  They ordered a bottle of wine, only to be told it wasn't in stock.  Then the same thing happened with their second choice.  The room is beautiful with an elegant atmosphere, but while eating I noticed time is taking a toll.  One of the heavy drapes was half falling at the top of the high ceiling and the overall look of the back-lit bar and room was a little dingy.   Most of us locals know Stations is in trouble.  We were there on a Monday night so the bar area was totally dead and the restaurant was not very full either.  Even so, they were swarming with servers and help.  There were at least 5 different servers for our table alone.  This place needs serious management change...and new owners, obviously.  No plans to go back...ever again!"}
{"text":"Congratulations. Second best filet mignon in my eyes in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"After hearing stories from my father about this venue, I was quite excited to go with him for our family friends birthday. We had a great time, but there were a few problems that kept this location from getting a \"five star\" review.  In terms of atmosphere the restaurant is beautiful. There are elegant and grand chandeliers all over the place. This is one of the most luxuriously and modern appointed steakhouses I have ever been to. Even the bathroom had floor to ceiling marble.   The food was delectable. My father and I split a Chateaubriand steak which was sliced table side. It was one of the best steaks I have ever had. At the end of our meal the staff brought out a great big slice of cheesecake with some raspberries and a candle for our friend. It was fantastic and the entire dinner meal went off without a hitch.   The big problem, which was a bit of a downer before our meal, was the bar and their service. We decided to get before our meal.   The staff at the bar are complete space cadets and made multiple irritating mistakes. First, it took twenty minuets to get our drinks, Then, when the waitress realized she got our drink order wrong she spilled one of our martinis all over the table and failed to clean it up. When the right drinks finally did arrive, another waitress decided to drop a full coffee cup right next to us sending glass everywhere. Our bar experience was only depreciated by another ten minute wait for our credit card to be taken. I had the impression from the service that the staff could possibly be drunker then I was!  Luckily for Hank's, the restaurant side is so wonderful that it easily made up for the terrible bar. Our meal on the restaurant side went perfectly and was one of the highlights of my vacation."}
{"text":"I've dined at Hank's several times and each time it was truly excellent.  I base this 90% on meat quality and 10% on service...both of which are truly top notch.  The atmosphere in Hank's is elegant and beautiful...it literally looks like they spent millions of dollars on it.  Great place to take a date or for a celebration.  But be prepared...it is anything but cheap.  $60 per person would be the bare minumum if you order a steak...but you won't feel ripped off afterwards."}
{"text":"We stopped over in Henderson on our way back to LA and thought we'd try one of the off-Strip hotels. I heard Henderson was a little old school so when I booked a reservation at Hank's I envisioned a gun slinging, beer swilling saloon type steakhouse. BOY was I wrong. It was fancy and classy and very awesome. We all shared the Seafood platter. For $75.00 we got a ginormous platter of Lobster, Crab Legs, Oysters and Shrimp."}
{"text":"We were disappointed, especially for the price point. The level of service and order accuracy was appalling. We waited over 40 minutes for our steaks to arrive, and my husbands med rare steak came out practically raw, and so did someone else's in our party. Neither of them are them. Even after a complaint by someone in our party, no apology was granted.  We expected a better experience for sure."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for my favorite steak place in Las Vegas, so when I saw this place, I couldn't wait to give it a try.  Very classy place and friendly service.  Being off the strip, I was hopeful that it would be my go to place.  Although it was good, it also won't be my go to place.  First of all, getting service was bad.  For drinks, for ordering, for getting the check, they just ignored us even when we flagged them down.  And then as a high end steak place, I didn't think the steak met expectations.  Sure it seemed of a high grade, but it was just a little more than medium rare and didn't have any flavor.  Too bad, I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"First time coming here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Honestly the restaurant is beautiful and the decor is so nice. Our server was James but I guess theirs 3 servers in total that serves you which was a bit confusing. James was a great server to us but the service in general was alright. Food was alright nothing special."}
{"text":"Meh. Steak experience was pretty sub par but they charge an arm and a leg.  I was told to go there for there specials at 5 which I went on a Friday.  I just simply said do you have a lunch special or something. I said it wrong, my bad but he said we only serve dinner and rolled his eyes.  Well, there's a happy hour he could of suggested.  We were off to a bad start already.  Long story short, the rib eye steak alone is $57...when I mean alone, I really mean alone.  If you wanted a side of mash potato, it's ala cart of $10, $10 for asparagus and keep building up your plate to $80 a plate.  So not worth it.  In this economy, save your money and get a great size steak at the Cafe.  Enuff said."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is great. Everything I have had here is delicious! I highly recommend the fried Oreos for dessert. Its a beautiful restaurant with a friendly and helpful Staff. Definitely my favorite steak house in Henderson."}
{"text":"Do I have to select a star rating??? I'm really torn on how many stars to click. They're not exactly \"A-OK\" but I'm not \"Yay! I'm a fan\" for Hank's either.   Came here for Valentine's dinner....place was packed!!! We had reservations for 7:15p and we got seated within 5 minutes. They had a Valentine's special menu or you can order from their normal menu as well.  For appetizers: Boyfriend got the WEDGE salad. He really liked their peppercorn ranch dressing. I got the LOBSTER CHOWDER. Yum!!!! Probably my favorite item of the night. (yeah, pretty sad that an appetizer is the best thing I've had all night.)  Entrees: We both got the 8oz petite filet mignon. I can't speak for my boyfriend since he's not the one writing the review, but personally....this steak was nothing special. AT ALL. I've read some of the reviews and some people were right. The steak was flavorless without any seasoning. Flemings, Ruth Chris and Mastros have better steaks than this!!!!! Ultimately, I was disappointed. Not even looking forward to my leftovers that's still in the fridge =/  Sides: -broccoli -Potatoes Au Gratin: ehh....pretty average. Again, Flemings come to mind. Their Flemings Potatoes is their version of Potatoes Au Gratin and damnnnn....theirs is freakin orgasmic!!!!!!! (I promise you I don't work for Flemings. I'm only comparing Hank's to Flemings because Flemings potatoes are the best I've had.)  Also, service wasn't attentive that night. Yes, I know it was Valentine's night but oddly enough, it wasn't DURING our dining experience our waiter went MIA on us. It was when the bill came. It took awhile to find him and ask for the check. Our drinks were empty, our empty salad/soup bowls were left on our table for quite some time before it was picked up. Someone else also mentioned that for the price you're paying....service here is mediocre.  -1 star for spotty service -1 star for the flavorless steak  If you're a tourist, don't bother going out of your way to Hank's. I promise you there are plenty of better fine steakhouses on The Strip."}
{"text":"Disappointed!!!!! They gave us the wrong meal the meal that belong to the could next to us. Then we asked should we be eating this it's not our order .We were told yes just eat it wrong side dishes wrong steak ! We asked for the manage who should of automatically fix it but instead kept asking \" what do you want me to do to fix it? When you pay 60.00 for a piece of meat you shouldn't? be asking me how to fix it. I had to ask him not to charge for th couple next to us steak. They never brought us OUR steak... Little do they know I write a good critic colum."}
{"text":"The dining atmosphere is warm and sophisticated, the service was efficient and friendly, and the food is out of this world!"}
{"text":"First off, Green Valley Ranch Resort is a hidden gem in the suburbs of Vegas. I am told its part of the 'Station' family.   Dinner. We had an awesome wine recommendation, so perhaps the vino impacted my rating!  They brought out a seafood platter that could have fed an army: oysters, lobster tail, shrimp...unbelievable.   Most of the table ordered steaks, and raved. I was just not in the mood, so I ordered french onion soup and buttermilk fried chicken breast. I never order fried chicken...but the server was correct that it was a hidden jewel on the menu. Moist, and Southern comfort food at its best.   Expect a large bill, but its Vegas, which means no more inexpensive meals.   One more point--there is a 15 foot wide glass double-sided fireplace in the middle of Hanks. Too cool."}
{"text":"Hanks Steaks & Martinis is the Best Steakhouse I've found in the Las Vegas area since \"The Flame\" that was located in the back of the old Desert Inn Hotel. Hank's (20 ounce) Bone-In, Dry aged 28 days Filet Minion is the second best Steak I've ever had.  We'll worth a trip on a special event, Birthday &/or Anniversary . Located in Henderson at the Green Valley Ranch Resort and Spa. Every time I think about that meal I start to salivate !"}
{"text":"happy hour is wonderful  5-7  but the dinner atmospher is too noisy....accustics are very poor and lighting is not atmospheric....but the food is very good and very, very expensive.  we find that we don't win very well at that casino"}
{"text":"The kentucky bone in steak is the best.  Ive tried all the steaks you have to try it.  The drinks are kind of expensive.   The tuna is just alright but there breads are great.   Give them a shot great steak."}
{"text":"Wrote a review of the hotel including Hank's already, but, we had an extremely great experience here.  We were treated very special and we are just two normal people.  The food was great and the drinks in the bar are fantastic (try the ginger and pear martinis.)  I would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to hit happy hour is at the swanky bar at Hank's. The martinis are half price...that's right half price. My favorite is the Koi Martini made with Absolut Peach, fresh lime, mango puree, fresh sweet and sour... Wow! And they shake their martinis a minimum of 20 times so they are ice cold. Make sure and ask Megan as she creates the best martinis and will custom make to your liking. Ask her to make an Orange Blossom or a Blueberry Lemon Drop...they are awesome. The food is pricey but very good. And the bathrooms are extravagant! Hey when you drink several happy hour martinis you appreciate a beautiful bathroom!"}
{"text":"Note: this review is strictly for happy hour!  That being said, this has to be one of the best higher end happy hours anywhere in Vegas, Henderson or surrounding.  By that I mean you won't find wings or PBR specials, and there's nothing wrong with that but if you're a fan of quality bar food and even higher quality martinis then Hank's is the place for you!  Happy hour starts at 4 but the kitchen doesn't open until 5. I highly recommend getting there early. It's tough to get a spot between the locals and those happening to stumble upon this gem.  I started off with Hank's Dirty martini. All martinis are half off! Most around the $15 range. This particular one is comprised of Belvedere vodka, olive juice and blue cheese olives. Simple, I know, but I swear there's unicorn breathe and bits of sunshine in this one. Stellar martini and crafted perfectly. Firm 5/5  Decided to try the lobster gougeres next. Puff pastry like cream puff dough filled with lobster, gruyere and basil topped off with a rich lobster cream. The dough is a little overpowering in these. Lobster taste is there for sure but still the dough to lobster ratio was off. 3/5 for these.  Next was the crispy tuna tacos. Sashimi grade tuna in a crispy wonton taco shell. Amazing. Tuna, avocado and a ponzu like sauce marry together in a union of flavor and bliss. Light and refreshing and not overfilling at all. 5/5  Next was the beef carpaccio. Drizzled with a Dijon cream sauce and flakes of parmesan... by far one of the best carpaccio tales we've had a chance of trying! 5/5  Lastly and by far our favorite was the braised beef rib with a red wine reduction on a bed of potato purée. The beef was beyond tender to the point it could be pulled off the bone and eaten with a spoon.  The atmosphere and decor alone set this place apart from most and then you add the A+ service and you've got the recipe for fantastic."}
{"text":"This is a sure bet, Never a bad meal or drink and service is on point, This is the best in are area of town"}
{"text":"Love Hank's!! Best service, best food, our fave hangout.   We truly appreciate the team there. They really take care of their regulars. Thanks for making it great for us...every time!!"}
{"text":"High-End Steakhouse? Vegas has a million of 'em! But Hank's stands out in the crowd.  I would like to give Hank's a shout out for something rarely acknowledged on Yelp: this place is well MANAGED. Here bartenders know how to pour, staff knows how to serve, and the kitchen knows how to cook. If you have ever run a business, you know these are not by accident, but by design, with great staff executing a solid plan."}
{"text":"This place sucks! I ordered chicken, tomatoes and mozzarella,  Mac n cheese, and mashed potatoes and it was terrible. Not fresh. Everything tasted like they warmed it up and it was already made. Staff is very stuck up. It's GVR. Way too stuck up for this area. We will not be back. Everything was like a sales pitch. We're here for dinner. We'll order and we don't need to be sold lol!"}
{"text":"My favorite place.  Top notch food and the atmosphere is incredible. Best live piano/guitar music around.  The food is very good from the steakhouse chop salad, creamed corn to the flavorful steaks!"}
{"text":"Hanks has gone downhill. It was the absolute best at one time.  The phenomenon they are experiencing is called resting on your laurels.  Management is at fault but the gradual dwindling of their business is happening because the staff is rude and gradually people are doing what I'm doing and finding other places to pay $60 for a steak.  Food is still good.  The hearts of palm salad was always a favorite.  The truffle tater tots used to be amazing but the last few times I have eaten there, they just are not the same.  To give you an example of what I mean by the staff is rude...if they were to be told they were rude, without question  they would retort that it is because the patron is a jerk.  They are confrontational and righteous versus polite and helpful and friendly.   The bartenders in this town all have a difficult job.  There are so many rude, drunk and otherwise unpleasant people that over time I could see a tendency to lump all customers in to that category and treat them accordingly.   I watch people very closely.  These people have much more interest in talking crap on the customers with each other than they do in doing their jobs.  It's the unspoken disregard for the customer experience, the inattentive service, and the overall perspective that coming to work is a social outing for the employee and having to deal with these bothersome customers who want us to pretend like we are glad they are here is an effort.  I will suffer through mediocre service at Denny's, but when I am paying for $16 martinis, I want to be served with a sincere smile.  I could go on. Bottom line is this.  After my last two visits there, it doesn't surprise me that it seems way slower."}
{"text":"Just finished a phenomenal meal at Hank's. Can't say enough about the incredible food and service. From the crab cocktail to the butter toffee cake. All to die for. But the highlight had to be the steak which they wet age and then dry age and the grilled corn. Also have to give major props to one of our servers, Luis. We shared the steak and added an oscar topping and he made sure to do the oscar topping on the side so we could both get a good amount after he carved our steak table side. He was also super friendly, warm, and attentive. All my favorite qualities in a server. We will be back.  PS They also heat up the cream for the coffee. Nice touch."}
{"text":"My love for a great filet brought me to Hank's establishment for a celebratory dinner last week.  My mother was awarded employee of the month at GVR and our dinner at Hank's was partial paid for by the fine people at GVR.  Hank's decor is reminiscent of Circus Circus Steakhouse with the built-in fireplace, but also has beautiful crystal chandeliers throughout the building.  Upon entering, my family and I were seated in the posh dinning room by the kind hostess and greeted by our trio of waiters.  The service at Hank's was top notch and some of the best I've had the pleasure to experience.  The bread basket consisted of both cheese and raisin breads with a great side of butter that was extremely tasteful.  We didn't spend much time with appetizers, however, our server Michael's recommendation on the wedge cut salad with crushed bleu cheese was amazing!  We each ordered our favorites for entrees.  My younger brothers' Lobster tail with lemon buerre was one item that I can almost still taste :)  My 12oz Filet was cooked to perfection and rates as high as any steakhouse filet i've previously experienced.  I ordered it medium-rare with the gorgonzola cheese crust and peppercorn sauce.... simply epic!!! My parents went with a filet & spare ribs, which were both excellent.    Another splendid addition to our entrees were the sides that accompanied them.  The creamed corn gets mentioned in the Yelp reviews specifically because it is THAT good! It could be the best side dish I've ever had.  I want everyone reading to think of the best creme brulee you've had, now, imagine it made with corn LOL, yup that good.  The tater tots with truffle oil were good and the mash potatoes were equally excellent.  Overall, my steakhouse experiences are intermediate at best.  However, this is one of the best places I've had the pleasure of experiencing and I hope that you can all make a trip to Hank's for some FINE steaks & Martini's real soon."}
{"text":"Bad experience! Didn't care about helping me and my pregnant wife get a table while more than half of the restaurant was empty, and stayed empty."}
{"text":"Service was amazing!  The staff are attentive and your drink is never empty they are personable and discreet when appropriate.  The food menu just made My mouth water!  So hard to chose!  Try it all!  oysters were fresh and perfectly shucked, rack of lamb off the charts and the scallops such an amazing dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Last night was visit #3 to this location.  First trip was a year ago. Me wife and daughter got a great table and ordered drinks from a very friendly server.  Ordered 3 apps, they were out of two if them.  I ordered the steak, my wife ordered the special which was fish, and my daughter ordered the Ahi. 20 minutes we were told they were out of the special. It was 6:15 in the evening and they ran out of the special. Nice.  Over all, this night was a 2night.   Second trip by myself at the bar. Great glass of wine and a perfect Wagyu filet.  This visit was a 4night.   Then last night. Drinks and apps. Drinks were great, Lemon Drops. The VERY friendly server apologized for the 30 delay. Seriously, 30 minutes for 2 happy hour apps.   My issue here is the kitchen. Easy to see after 3 trips, they need help. Know from an \"insider\" they have a huge problem keeping a quality chef. That's quite evident after 3 trips. Love the place, love the servers, love the cocktails. The kitchen is the problem here.  Should be a 5. Honestly a 3 is more than fair."}
{"text":"A real gem. As good as the food was - my wife and I both had perfectly prepared filet mignons - we thought the service was even better. There's a fine line between the wait staff being attentive and hovering too much, but these folks had it down just right. The ambience was classy and tasteful, even more impressive than what was displayed on its website. The food was a bit overpriced, I thought, but not obscenely high. When the service and atmosphere were factored in, it made for a fair value. Bottom line: We definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best steakhouse in Las Vegas! The BEST customer service in the WORLD!"}
{"text":"The service was slow and mediocore at best while the food was not worth the price paid. I will not be going back to this restaurant n the near future until I hear they have improved the entire operation."}
{"text":"Great Service, Great Food, Excessive Price Point  Let me start by complimenting the service at Hanks.  From the hostess to the server and the serving team, the service is great!  I was really impressed with everyone.  The team was super friendly, very professional, and didn't try to push us towards expensive dishes or sides.  That said, we go to restaurants for food.  While the food is very good, the price point is ridiculous.  This is my third time to Hanks, but the first time back in about seven years.  I've been to T-Bones several times, and always thought of the two places as the same restaurant (with a slight nod to T-Bones for being a bit better although I think they are about the same now).  My wife and I shared a Steakhouse Salad, which was excellent.  The restaurant split it without an upcharge, which is always nice.  The salad itself was great and I would order it again.  For dinner, I had the Wagyu 10 ounce filet ($86) and my wife had the 22 ounce rib eye ($68).  My first comment to my wife was the price.  I've eaten at Michael's, Gordon Ramsey Steak, Craftsteak, Carnevino (meh - pass on this place), Del Frisco's, Michael Mina, etc., so I think it's fair to say that I've tasted a fair amount of the steakhouses on the strip to local places (Golden Steer).  We have even eaten at Guy Savoy and Robuchon.  This was the first time I was shocked at the prices for a semi-local steakhouse.  I mean, you can get a rib eye cap from Craftsteak for $64 (or even the Wagyu skirt steak as a better deal than the Hank filet) or $66 from Gordon Ramsay steak, so seeing a simple rib eye for $68 was a shocker to me.  I don't mind paying a bit of a premium to eat at a celebrity restaurant, but I will not pay that much for a local place.  From what I remembered, the price point at T-Bones was much more reasonable and in line of an off-strip restaurant.    As for the food, it was quite excellent.  My Wagyu filet was amazing.  For a filet, it had a fair amount of marbling and tasted phenomenal.  If I was ever going back to Hank's, which I'm not, I would order it again.  However, the rib eye kind of sucked.  It had a super umami flavor from being wet / dry aged, so you need to like that type of earthy flavor.  Michael's also ages its meats, but they are simply just better.  Anyway, the rib eye really lacked the fatty taste that makes a rib eye a rib eye.  If you put this rib eye against Old Homestead's rib eye, there is no comparison, Old Homestead is just better.  If you put it up against a rib eye cap, which really isn't a fair comparison, then you're better off just going to Gordon Ramsay steak and ordering it there so you can also order the sticky toffee pudding since you'll get a better steak for a better price at a fancy restaurant with an amazing dessert.    The food is really good at Hank's, but it isn't worth the prices they are charging.  You can spend the same amount of money at a strip restaurant or spend significantly less money and just go to the Silverado Steakhouse at the South Point and get the same quality service and same quality food (albeit with much better tasting rib eye)."}
{"text":"We have been in Las Vegas now for about one year. We usually go to The M for our meals, but was told about this casino, and checked it out. We went to have a glass of wine at the Bar and across the way was Hanks. It's reviews seemed good. Boy were we wrong.   First off my wife loves crab. Crab cocktails or crab cakes or crab claws. If it has crab in it, she loves it. We ordered the appetizer crab cocktail. It was really bad. For my wife to turn it away should have been the first sign. Also, tip to waiters, when you take away a plate and it's full of food, ask if it was ok. Insist on asking.   Then we came to the steaks. Steak house we should get steaks. Medium rare is pretty standard order for us. Well they came medium.  Very disappointed.   It's going to take me some serious arm twisting to give Hanks a try again."}
{"text":"I just love this restaurant from the seafood to the steaks everything is delicious and fresh. I have never seen such a big sweet potatoe,  it's enough for 4 people. It's served with brown sugar,  cinnamon,  and butter on the side......awesome. All their sides are good. They serve very generous portions, so if you like to share it's a good idea. The wait staff is very knowledgeable and on top of their game. Excellent service, bar none."}
{"text":"Don't even waste your time going to this place. In order to get a spot at the bar you either have to be friends with the bartenders or the casino host. Once someone vacates the bar, the bartenders quickly throw down place mats with \"reserved\" signs. When questioned about saving bar spots, you'll be told it\"s at the request of the casino host. The food is only average anyway. If you want a better steak and friendly atmosphere, go to Ocean Club (Mastros)."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Hanks. I will say that the seafood platter appetizers filled me up. Still had enough room to get a couple of bites of my steak which melted in my mouth. It made for a great left overs. Steak and eggs in the morning was so delicious. I would highly recommend this place especially if you are looking for a date night with your loved one. Great atmosphere and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I brought my friend from Austin to Hanks for the happy hour on Monday. Meagan and Renee were the bartenders and really helped her choose the perfect martini. They were helpful through out our experience and we loved watching them shake martinis all night, however their attire could be better. The shirts were just blah, could be more fancy in our opinion."}
{"text":"Beautiful dining room. Excellent service.   Best steak I've ever had is their Wagyu Filet. Very expensive and worth it.   Incredible wine selection.   I would travel from the strip to eat hear.   A true 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Order steak well done (that is the way I like it). Steak served rare and I asked the waiter to cook it more per my preference. Some 20 minutes later, when the others at my table had finished their meal, my steak had still NOT arrived.   Very poor service considering the price.  NOT RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place. Every time I go to a steakhouse or any sort of fine dining, I do have expectations. I do understand when it is busy but when I dined here, it wasn't.  And I asked for two waters, one with ice and one without ice. He brought me two with ice. I also ordered wine at the very beginning and had to remind my waiter twice for my wine AFTER my food had arrived. I swear up and down I ordered red wine as well and I got a white wine. But, my server never came to check on our table, so I never got the chance to tell him, so I just drank my white wine. It's a good thing it wasn't terrible.  & If I wasn't with good company, I would've been a lot more grumpy due to the fact my food also took a long while to come out. My waiter did not even inform me nor apologize that it was going to be awhile. My food comes out and its barely nuke warm, that's including the two steaks and various sides we ordered... He never checked up on us to see how everything tastes or see how we were doing.  I'm sure this place is good most days, but my experience here was not good especially if my bill is nearly $300 not including tip. Not coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. So many better steak houses in Vegas. Way way way over priced. $80 lobster was over cooked $60 cut of steak very large but no seasoning. We spent $200 on a dinner that is no better than Applebee's. So disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is just ok for me. The restaurant has a nice setting, good service, and nice entertainment. The food is good but not great for the price. The steaks were slightly over aged for my taste, au gratin potatoes were very tasty though. They have a nice wine list with many options for all budgets. Its worth a try if you are at gvr and looking for a nice meal but I prefer most of the steak houses on the strip over this place."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stayed at GVR right after getting engaged. We went to Hanks for happy hour after the pool and enjoyed the martinis and tuna tacos. The bartenders were fun and gorgeous. The next night we met friends for drinks and had the same great service. Then we went to dinner. The superb service began with the hostess who remembered is from the night before and congratulated us on our engagement again. Then the wait staff was the best I've experienced in Las Vegas and we frequent restaurants on and off the strip. It seemed as though there was a person specific to our individual needs. One made sure our drinks were full, another offered knowledgeable suggestions for dinner, and a third was in charge of cocktails. The timing of the food was perfect and all staff were very friendly without being annoying. We ordered the seafood platter appetizer, lobster chowder, kitchen sink salad, scallops and Mac and cheese. Amazing! I would go back for the seafood platter alone. Seriously the best service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Went to the Easter brunch was absolutely delightful truly wonderful experience to share with the family the food was fresh engaging and very tasteful if you ever have the opportunity it is really a place you must try for brunch"}
{"text":"Always a real treat when in town was going to HH at Hanks. But recently returned after being away for the summer, only to discover the HH menu had somewhat changed. Informed by an unusually surly female bartender, now some of the HH apps 'rotate'... whatever that means. So you're looking for those great beef sliders once was a staple... don't count on 'em being offered. Now they could be something like a very tasteless version of what's being referred to as a 'sloppy-joe' slider."}
{"text":"SWANKY!  You know you're going to a great place when you walk inside and it is 3 people deep at the bar and everyone is enjoying themselves. The bartenders are quick to take care of you and make sure you have an incredible experience. It's nice to have so many varieties of martinis.   Then once you are entering the main dining room, the real experience begins. Again, this staff is quick and friendly to ensure you have a memorable time. I would highly recommend the fillet Mignon, medium rare, with a side of creamed horse radish sauce. Their cream corn has been a signature dish since opening day and it tastes better spoon by spoon by spoon.   While I am not a connoisseur of desserts, I have seen what they have to offer and it is far from being disappointing.   Granted this steakhouse might seem a little pricey in comparison to others in the city, however it is the attentive service combined with the variety, presentation and excellence of food that makes this a place one not to miss."}
{"text":"Fine steaks and Martinis. Definately a keeper inside Green Valley Ranch. I love the food and its all good. Try the seafood como appetizer and you get it all. Pricey but good. Lump crabmeat cocktail, filet, potato and whiskey and the party is on! But they seem to get lounge lizard musicians that dont help the great vibe in the room."}
{"text":"I almost hate to write a review after reading other YELP reviews. Seems to write a review on YELP these days you must be clever, witty, and have a brilliant, writers mind. I do not, but I love me some food!  This place tastes great! Surf and Turf, Gorgonzola mashed potatoes,  Steamed spinach and a Wedge. Oh, 2 Kettle One martinis with a twist and a nice Cab.   Very pricey but outstanding service. I can not think of one thing I disliked about this place other than the restroom was so damn far away."}
{"text":"Not good at all very over priced I you are should just to to whole foods and cook your own .. It's way better and organic and grass fed"}
{"text":"Delicious steaks. Promotional menus can be reasonably priced. Service was excellent. Delicious steak sauces provided with the steak sliced at the table. Relaxing atmosphere.  Hostess was slightly rude about not having a reservation."}
{"text":"My friends and I felt like the Rat Pack walking into Hank's. It is modern, yet has that old Vegas vibe to it. The decor is FIVE STARS all the way. We sat in our booth for moment to take it all in before even opening the menus.   We ordered several different cocktails all of which were spot on and delivered quickly. The waiter had the script down and provided excellent service with the help of his helpers if that makes any sense. There was a team helping us!   Now on to my favorite part, the food. We ordered the special salad which was a Tomato & Watermelon Caprese and we LOVED it. In fact, I am making it for my family for Thanksgiving. Then we proceeded to order close to everything else on the menu.  Garlic Mashed Potatoes- Take the Gold medal for Sides  Mac & Cheese- bland and runny  Asparagus- no big deal Creamed Spinach- Yes, please.....Y-U-M   We ordered mores sides, but nothing spectacular about them. Now for the soup and steak. I am a huge fan of French Onion Soup and have to order it every time I see it on a menu. Hank's has the best I have had EVER! It's in a huge black pot and stayed hot for the entire journey this soup took my taste buds through. Maybe it's the choice of fine melted cheese atop the broth or the hint of Rosemary, or the amount of never ending onions....but this soup is in the Hall of Fame for me. I want it back in my belly NOW.   Lastly, the steak. I went with the Petite Filet, butterflied of course with a  Peppercorn sauce and continued to fall madly in love with this restaurant. It was like butter and I didn't want it to end!   Overall this restaurant is really a 5 Star with a few 2 Star sides. I don't know if it was a combination of the company I was with or the atmosphere, but overall this was one of the best dining experiences as a whole. I plan on coming back again, and again and again....."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been back two more times and have sat in the bar.  We really do like the atmosphere of this place and its close to our house.  We were hoping our first visit was just on a bad night. Here is an update:  The drinks, salads and apps are always really good.    Both times, my wife ordered her petite fillet \"butterflied\" to make it easy for the \"grill master\" to get it to medium well.  The fillet now comes well done and tough.   I ordered the rib-eye both times medium rare and both times it came rare.  We are never ordering steaks here again.  3 strikes and your out.  We are only going back for drinks and apps in the lounge.   I also question the 35 days dry aged beef...  it sure does not taste like other places.  It blows my mind that this is suppose to be a high end steakhouse and they cannot cook a steak!  We recently went to \"The Broiler\" at Boulder Station (another station property) before a show at the Railhead.  1/2 the price and they have a chef that knows how to cook steaks to temperature."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their happy hour!  Half price martinis, how can you beat that!  It's the perfect location for a few drinks before going out for the night.  The food on the happy hour menu looks delicious as well but we were going to dinner so I will have to be back to enjoy that!  I had a dirty martini, you can choose whatever liquor you want.  Others in my party had the key line martini, a mango one, and one with a jalapeno and all were excellent!  The staff was attentive and engaging.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Dined here on 11-26-17. Ordered Martinis before dinner the bartender was not friendly at all, although it was happy hour but still no excuse. We were led to our table in the  main dining area by the hostess who was very nice, our server was nice but that was about it.  The steaks everyone in my group ordered were cooked excellent.  I agree with another reviewer that my steak wasn't seasoned well and did need salt, after that it was very good.  Overall I'm glad I finally tried Hanks, i spent a lot of money but it was worth it for the special occasion."}
{"text":"Another fine Stations steakhouse!!!  Atmosphere was impressive and the food was excellent!!!     For starters we had the tuna tartare and the seafood platter.  The tuna tartare was okay.  I've had better.  The seafood platter was amazing.  Stone crab claws, huge shrimp cocktail, prawns, perfect Kumamoto oysters, lump crab meat... Wow!!!  They have an amazing horseradish that they call atomic.  Clears your sinuses so use sparingly...but it is so delicious.    I ordered the bone-in rib eye.  I was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious with the cracked peppercorn sauce.  The kids ordered petite filets and the fried chicken.  Amazing!!!  The wife and kids ordered dessert.  The carrot cake slice was big enough to feed four!!!  Great restaurant!!  We will return!!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed with regard to the steak. We had the ribeye steak and have had a much better ribeye  from Vons Supermarket (seriously the best ribeye steaks are at Vons!).  My husband had the crab cakes for an appetizer and said they were good. We had a martini that was excellent. $10.00 for a baked potato is kind of obnoxious even if they were being shipped in from another planet it's such an obvious markup. Atmosphere was nice and the people sitting at the bar for happy hour were having a blast drinking their 1/2 priced martinis. I had a comp for Hanks so I am happy I got to experience it but even more happier I didn't have to pay for it."}
{"text":"I truly wish I had thought to leave a review closer to my birthday back in April, bc my thoughts were fresh then. ;)   I work at a high end steak house on the strip and we decided to dine here for my 40th birthday.  I had family and friends in from out of town and every single person was blown away by their dining experience.  Even my own husband who has dined where I work.  He might be a traitor. ;)   Our serving staff (I want to say Scott maybe? - tall guy, chiseled chin, and his partner - guy with great hair and maybe an accent, looks like a Baywatch guy) went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed to fully enjoy our dining experience.  Service was top notch.  Just wish I could remember names so they could get the recognition they deserve.  Cocktails - while we did have some wine, the martinis were so fun to look through and order.  I think the Elvis one was everyone's favorite!  The food. :) From the tempera shrimp, to the fancy tacos, steaks, veggies, everything was AMAZING.  The executive chef - Doug even came out to make sure everything was fantastic.  The hospitality from the Chef was such a nice touch.  The wagyu steak was amazing.  I took home what we couldn't finish and cried when my drunk self dropped it on the floor, it was THAT good.  We chose to have everything a little more family styled than what they do on a normal basis and they gave us exactly what we asked for with no hesitation even though it wasn't their normal service.  Truly appreciated the dining experience for a special milestone.  Can't rave enough about the whole package.  Well done, Hanks & staff!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great ambiance, and variety of Martini's and snacks. Classy so dress nice. Happy hour was better than it is now as they offered more but Martini deals still exist. This review for the bar area."}
{"text":"Hanks is a classy joint.  The employees are fun & friendly.  The food & drinks are excellent.  Peter Love & Late Night Jams are becoming a habit for us on Friday nights.  Glad to have good music & atmosphere nearby."}
{"text":"Delicious (and strong!) martinis. Great food and atmosphere. One of the best happy hours in town. Not a lot of bad things I can say about this place!"}
{"text":"Take the off-strip journey to Hank's if you:  crave the highest quality steaks, and related trimmings. enjoy cozy seating & fantastic ambience. enjoy hearing eclectic music selections from a bar pianist/singer. insist on superb service. want easy, unpretentious help choosing the perfect wine. want to seem like you know the hidden gems of Vegas. want to score major points with your dinner date.  There are so many great steak restaurants in Las Vegas, and when you ask locals where the best steak is, they'll give you all different answers. They are all great too, but for me, it's Hank's. The experience, as a whole, cannot be matched by the others."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our anniversary dinner at Hanks and will be sure to come back again!  We started with the tomato/mozzarella appetizer and cold crab.  Both were awesome and the mustard with the crab was wonderful.  I enjoyed the scallops which were cooked perfectly as well as the cauliflower which had a nice flavor because of the horseradish cream, the sweet potato fries which were amazing, and the charred corn which I thought was just ok but my husband loved it.  For desert was the crem brûlée.  Amazing of course!  I tried the cantaloupe martini but it was too sweet for me.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Hank's sits on a thrown right next to all of your classic high end steak houses. What they have done well is added a slap of modernity and class to the whole experience. To me, this is one of the most awesome looking dining rooms and bars in Vegas. The lighting, the natural stone, the fireplace, amazing.  It is only suiting that the food follow suit. Expect to shell out a pretty penny for your meal. I had the crab cakes and steak house salad (which has no steak, hmm)?"}
{"text":"Hank's is one of the more enjoyable food establishments I've been to. When I arrived, I was greeted promptly, and took a seat at the bar. My bartender came over quickly, and helped us out.  Their happy hour was recommended to us, so we tried the Artichoke, the fish tacos, and the slider burgers. The artichoke was delicious, the fish tacos were truly remarkable, and the sliders were just right. The drinks had just enough kick to let you know that there was alcohol in there, but not enough to overpower the entire drink. The bartender checked in on us multiple times, and the manager on duty (his name is Jon I believe) even put a particular soccer match we wanted to watch on for us, as we were traveling at the time!! I had a great experience overall, and couldn't have been more delighted with the food quality, the service, and the friendliness of the staff. I would definitely go there again!!"}
{"text":"I was waiting for the moment Hank's was going to disappoint, after all its in any establishment's nature to have a bad day. But it never happened. Coming here 5 times - every steak was phenomenal, martinis were never anything less than tasty, the service was always impeccable, the live entertainment was consistently classy, and every experience was top notch. It should come as no surprise to anyone but it is without a doubt, Green Valley Ranch's best restaurant.  It started with their 5-7 happy hour. Sitting by the bar and enjoying the piano ballads / live jazz, while sipping away with colleagues / clients on some of their killer martinis. From the dry glass to the exotic flair, I have always enjoyed their lychee and koi martinis. Every sip was smooth and the potency of the after taste made for a great finish. As one goes further into Henderson, these places just don't seem to exist.  When it was evident the drinks would be taking a toll, it was on occasion, some complimentary bar food from the generous bartenders. If it wasn't drinks on the house, it was sides from the kitchen. A creamy and no frills mac and cheese, some cream spinach, an incredibly tasty lobster chowder, and a fresh, yet plump variety of shrimp with some cocktail sauce. After too many chowders / bisques, along with some of the best crab cakes in Sin City, did I finally decide to shoot for what they're known for best: Steak.  I started small with a petite filet mignon, which for $40 was a bit more paltry than I had hoped. But any meat with the words \"petite\" or \"small cut\" is going to be a pricier, albeit unsatisfying portion for any serious carnivore. Instead of focusing on its size, I switched it to its taste, which was nothing less than foodgasmic. Charred bits, smooth textures, and juicy meat at its finest. I eventually moved onto to the full sized 9oz filet($46) and the prime rib New York ($45), both of which had me going gaga for more.  Then there's the grand daddy. It's name is the Tomahawk Ribeye ($95) and while its a portion for two, I think I can gladly take it on by myself. It reminds me of something Tarzan or Fred Flintstone would eat - a hilarious hunk of meat on a bone, with a smell that ignites hunger for even the most casual meat eater. Paired with a gorgonzola crust ($8) and seared foie gras ($19) to add to the meal and sides of creamed spinach and potatoes, and its both a vegans worst nightmare and a glutton's finest moment.  I admittedly don't visit Henderson as much as I used to, but after writing this review and an impending trip to Vegas, I think I'm due for another visit."}
{"text":"Second time at Hanks. Both times the steaks were not cooked to the requested temperature. The first time I asked for my steak to be reheated because it was at room temperature. Service was excellent and quick.  The second time here was for a presentation/party, I asked for medium and received the filet at room temp and completely raw. Service was mediocre, slow or mostly absent; I would have like to have my filet cooked to the right temperature but couldn't find any servers after our dishes were served. What happened to promptly checking on your guests after the food is served?"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum.    I liked the decor.  The music was relaxing as well.  The service I felt was a bit too suggestive. If I want a recommendation, I will ask for one, but that's just me. Our server was very nice though & we didn't want for anything.  The food was great.  Simple & delicious.  The rib eye had the best crust on it from their super hot salamander.    The sides were tasty too, but not served warm enough.    Martinis & wine delish.  We shared everything & our bill only came to $200 including tip for two. That included an app of oysters on the 1/2, 2 sides (creamed corn & truffle tater tots), a 28 oz. rib eye and 2 glasses of wine & a martini.  Not bad.  Even better, it's close to home."}
{"text":"Very nice place for dinner with prices comparable to Morton's or Hy's.  The Buttermilk Chicken was great!  The ribeye was okay.  The creamed corn mashed potatoes were the bomb!  And finally, the service, top notch!  Excellent service!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most beautiful and exquisite restaurants located in Henderson, NV. When you first walk in the lighting and chandeliers will have you at awe.  You're instantly greeted and catered to at the door from their lovely hostesses.   I ordered the Crab Cakes - delicious, & I would get them again!  I also ordered the Kitchen Sink Caesar Salad - tasty, it has shrimp and avocado...my favs.  Lastly, the assorted breads are to die for!   Sad to say I don't have pictures of those plates because I wanted to enjoy the atmosphere but I did capture a few good photos of inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice enough place with decent food. Problem is, they are charging ultra high end prices equal to Prime @ Bellagio or Del Frisco's. This place is NOT in that category. Big signs everywhere saying \"we love locals\". Really? Then charging me strip prices for lesser food and service.   Gorgonzola mashed potatoes were awesome!!"}
{"text":"Attended another of Hank's Fine Steak & Martinis Restaurant wine dinners yesterday--first-class as always.  Evening was highlighting Joseph Phelps Vineyards and the executive chef's mastery of course paring.  Chef Charlie did an outstanding menu and the wines sampled were marvelous.  Started with a roasted Brussel sprouts salad with sliced apples, honey pecans and a jasmine honey vinaigrette--this was a simple salad with several sliced red apples and pecans light and easy.  Salad was pared with 2014 Joseph Phelps Freestone Sonoma Coast Chardonnay--I usually do not care for Chardonnay; however, this one did not have the heavy buttery and oakiness associated with most Chardonnays, found this to be very enjoyable.  Second course was a braised veal cheek atop a black truffle polenta, accompanied with spigarello broccoli all with a wonderful tarragon demi sauce.  This course was fantastic, the veal was extremely moist and tender with the polenta providing a good base to this dish.  This course was pared with 2013 Joseph Phelps Freestone Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir--this was a wonderful pinot.  The fish course was Black Bass--a flakey and buttery fish--served with a Kabocha Squash-- Asian variety of winter squash, a Japanese pumpkin--with a sweet and fluffy, chestnut-texture--served with quince and black trumpet mushrooms.  This course was outstanding, presentation and flavors, textures were perfect.  This was pared with 2014 Joseph Phelps St Helena Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc.  The main course was Red Wine marinated Flat Iron Steak with parsnip puree, Thumbelina carrots and praised fennel Bordelaise--a fabulous brown sauce flavored with red wine and shallots and garnished with poached marrow and parsley.  The steak prepared perfectly and was very tender with the correct amount of seasonings and the overall course was magnificent.  This was pared with 2013 Joseph Phelps Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.  The dessert course was almond gianduja bar--an Italian confection made of chocolate and 30% hazelnut paste with almonds.  Served with sour cream ice cream with gold foil garnish and spice meringue drops with berry gelee.  This was a light, delicate sweet but tart dessert.  Pared with 2013 Joseph Phelps insignia--one of the great Bordeaux blends.  Had a delightful time at this wine dinner--as always, the wines and the food were excellent.  Thank you to Hank's for a great time."}
{"text":"Had reservations for Christmas dinner at 5:15pm. I brought my 86 year old aunt here as her Christmas present.  When I booked the reservation, I told them it was her birthday.  When the hostess seated us, she confirmed with me it was her 86th birthday.  It was not terribly busy yet we waited for 15 minutes before a waiter showed up.  He said our waiter was busy so he was helping out.  We ordered our meal and waited.  I noticed a couple that was seated two tables over from us.  Their waiter went over immediately and took their order.  They were brought a bread basket and butter and their drinks.  We were still waiting for our drinks and soup.  My french onion soup was so salty I took one sip and left the rest.  We still never got our bread basket with our soup.  I finally saw one of the waiters and asked him if we could have some bread.  My aunt had ordered the lobster tail and scalloped potatoes.  I ordered the veal chop and mac and cheese. Her lobster tail was so tough it took a steak knife to cut it.  Her scalloped potatoes were lukewarm and horrible. My veal chop was actually very good but the mac and cheese was awful. Our waiter finally showed up and introduced herself and asked it we wanted dessert.  I thought she would bring out the birthday surprise for my aunt.  Instead, she brought me the check.  Honestly, I wanted this to be such a special occasion for her and it was absolutely the worst.  She wouldn't let me say anything about the service or the food.  The bill was $200 and I briefly considered not tipping, however, it was Christmas so I did.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses in Vegas. Nice atmosphere. Great service and tasty food. Not a place for jeans. Dress up a little."}
{"text":"My boyfriend made reservations here for a special occasion. From the moment we arrived they treated us like we were VIP. At least three different people consistently coming around to offer more cocktails, refresh water, check on us. The steak I ordered was yummy but not the best I've ever had in my life. The chocolate martini made my night though! I liked the live music, far enough away from the restaurant so you could make conversation. I loved the fire and chandeliers setting. Romantic and trendy."}
{"text":"This place is great for people wanting a good meal that is comparable to what you can get on the strip without going to the strip. We ordered oysters Rockefeller and french onion soup,I had the filet as well as creamed spinach. All was good and what you would expect it to be for a good steakhouse. The decor in hanks is beautiful and very elegant."}
{"text":"I honestly would not know where to start in terms of explaining how absolutely incredible our experience at Hank's was.....  I guess the first great sign was the stunning entry doors, then the super whammy \"better than the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles\" chandeliers throughout the gorgeous dining room.  The elevated glass fireplace was simply the final ridiculously stunnig touch (!)  The room was so beautiful, we thought that surely the food had to suffer in comparison, but we were oh so happy to be wrong!!  The steaks were the best we've ever tasted; the sides were all fresh and cooked to perfection (the bleu cheese mashed potatoes are beyond delicious!), the wine list was superb, the deserts classicly balanced - not overdone.  Our waiter, Jeff, was a doll!!  His timing was sheer perfection, and his attitude was the perfect balance of in-depth knowledge, but conversational - NOT STUFFY!!!  Very approachable; made the evening such a joy :-)  I simply cannot recommend Hanks' highly enough - Yelp may only have a five star rating system, but Hank's is a TEN :-)"}
{"text":"We went to Hank's for our office Xmas party. We all met up and gathered around the main bar. The bar was kinda busy, but after a long wait we realized we (3 women) were in no danger of being served. Although I noticed a few men come up to the bar after us, and they had no trouble receiving drinks.  Finally we decided to just go to our table. Once they say us in a private room for our dinner, the service impetus immensely.  I started off with the organic green tea. I started with the shrimp cocktail, then on to Caesar salad and born were good. After I warmed up a little I ordered the Pilot Noir to pair with my medium rare filet. This easily may be one of the best filets I've ever eaten. It was cooked perfectly. Very flavorful.   Afterwards, we went out to the Piano bar for a few more drinks. So much fun! Everyone was having a great time laughing, drinking and dancing around. We had a cute redheaded waitresses while at the piano bar and she was very good about keeping up with us.   All around it was an excellent night. Thanks to Hank's! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"OMG! Went for happy hour with a girlfriend and enjoyed the ambiance, live music, pear martin, pretzel bread, lobster roll, beef sliders and oysters rockefeller!"}
{"text":"I go to green valley ranch all the time and I'm surprise I don't come here more often considering the amount of comps I can get  Was with my boss last night and we had a very friendly bartender one of the drawbacks was that we both wanted a beer on tap and their taps were out which seems odd that you can't get that fixed especially in a casino really quickly  The service at bar is great , filling up  glasses without even having to ask and nice banter with the bartenders, didn't seem like they were just there doing their job they were trying to make the experience enjoyable for everybody  Start off with a jumbo shrimp cocktail which was fresh and had a decent sauce  I ordered a bone in filet mignon which was delicious and the Boss had a bone in ribeye but his was actually kind of tiny in size (height) even to the point where the guy sitting next to him said that ribeye looks tiny. I don't know if it was just an anomaly but he still like the way it was prepared and tasted  For the sides, went with the garlic mashed potatoes which was very nice with a fresh roast garlic on top and a mushroom medley which was pretty tasty as well  Overall not the best steak of ever had but very nice quality good ambience is very hard for me to give a steakhouse like this  five stars when I've been to so many other great ones? however four stars is the truthful review and there's nothing wrong with a four star spot  Looks like they have some decent happy hour options from 5 to 7 daily for food, I think I'll be going back and checking out some of those deals"}
{"text":"First time here for dinner and definitely one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. Exquisite flavour combinations. Appropriate sized portions. Melt in the mouth steak. Divine soufflé. Attentive service. Recommend ordering meat more well done than you might elsewhere as medium rare here would be rare elsewhere but the meat is such high quality it was delicious albeit visibly red. Highly recommended and you don't feel like you are eating in a casino restaurant."}
{"text":"I ate here about a year ago and would definitely come back if I'm ever rich.   I definitely underestimated the interior. Crystal walls line the booths, and an interior fireplace sets a nice, romantic mood. Like any upscale steak place, you order sides separately but at least the portions were adquate...more than enough for two people. In fact, i'd say each side could easily satisfy 4 or more people when you consider that everyone's got a steak to finish. I had the rib eye, creamed corn, and garlic potatoes. The steak was delectably seasoned and was probably one of the best I've ever had but I don't know if it was the best outright. I also don't know how likely it is that I'd be willing to drop hundreds of dollars on a dinner bill any time soon, but I must say that the place is nice and offers everything you need for a romantic steak dinner."}
{"text":"still my favorite steakhouse in Vegas and one of my favorite restaurants anywhere...  the Gorgonzola mashed potatoes have now made it onto the \"must try\" sides list"}
{"text":"Great ambience, awesome and attentive wait staff, great wine selection, delicious steaks. Less than impressed with the profiteroles, but everything else was top shelf."}
{"text":"I live in Henderson and absolutely love almost everything about Hank's.  It's definitely the closest fine dining establishment to me and certainly rivals all of the expensive, celebrity chef helmed steakhouses on the Strip.  The decor is incredibly classy and opulent, highlighted by the gorgeous chandeliers.  Very elegant but not over the top.  The bar is awesome for so many reasons.  First, it's huge with plenty of seating both at the bar and around it.  The bartenders are top notch and friendly.  There's usually live music with a piano in the corner or someone on guitar.  And most important, the martinis are some of the best in the city.  And the best part?  From 5-7 *every day* the drinks are half off.  Unbeatable!  Finally, the food is excellent and the quality of the steaks will compete with the best restaurants on the Strip.  Honestly, I like the steaks at Hank's better than places such as Prime, Delmonico and the Circus Circus Steakhouse, all highly rated and more expensive.  The seafood and sides are also very, very good.  Hank's is five stars all the way for me - I'm so happy it's there vs. the one star Bull Shrimp that used to be in the exact same spot in Green Valley Ranch.  Go to Hank's and you will not be disappointed.  One more thing - have Claudio serve you if possible.  Easily of the best servers in the entire city."}
{"text":"I remember discovering Ruth's Chris many years ago and thinking I'd died and gone to steak heaven.  Hank's is better.  This place puts out steak that will match or beat anything you've had at other high-end steak houses. On top of that their salads and sides are killer. I usually start with one of their tomato-mozzarella salads, although sometimes they have seasonal variations with watermelon, beets, or heirloom tomatoes - get one of those if you can. Hank's house salad is also super.  For the steak itself I usually go with their rare petit filet, but I've also enjoyed the bone-in ribeye. A crazy friend of mine once ordered, much to my horror, a butterfly-well-done filet. Yet when I tried it, it was still pretty damn good. Don't do that, though.  For sides, the mac and cheese is excellent, as is the ridiculous giant sweet potato with cinnamon butter. I usually get the plain but perfectly cooked steamed broccoli so I can fool myself into thinking I'm eating a balanced meal.  They have a pretty extensive wine list. I've never got a bottle, but the ones I've had by the glass were very good. The house martinis are also delicious and fun. I usually start the meal with one and then move on to something deep and red.  A neat surprise on the dessert menu is their unorthodox carrot cake, which nonetheless satisfies my purist carrot cake cravings. Give it a shot!  All that plus the decor has a lovely swanky feel and the staff hits just the right note of laid-back and attentive. The place is not cheap, but on par with similar establishments. Because it's so nearby I try to talk myself into going there pretty often, like it's a casual restaurant. Don't tell my budget, though.  My only complaint is that I'm usually not a fan of the live music they have there. It's not bad or anything; just a guy playing pop tunes on a piano, but somehow it's the wrong vibe for me. I'd much prefer something a little more slick and less common - maybe some old light jazz.  Summary: if you like high end steak, go here."}
{"text":"Favorite steakhouse ever. We never make reservations and will eat in the bar area. Love the friendly waitresses. Barb is the best!"}
{"text":"Waited over 35 mins from the time we ordered our drinks until they brought them to us. Granted it was busy, but that's inexcusable for the amount you pay here. The waitress was really nice and apologetic but seemed as if she was helpless to fix the situation.   The food is actually really good. If they lowered their prices by 20% their prices would be more in line with the quality."}
{"text":"Come for the steak, but stay for the creamed corn. Yes, their steaks are good. The 12 oz. filet ($46) that my wife and I split was just what we were craving -- a well-seasoned, tender, juicy cut that was maybe a touch too rare for the medium rare we ordered. But, excellent nonetheless.  The real show stopper, however, was the creamed corn ($10). You would be hard pressed to find a better version of it anywhere in town. This deliciously sweet dish was relatively light on the cream, but bold in flavor and the cracker crumbles on top added the requisite contrast in texture for this highly addictive steakhouse staple. The portion size was large, large enough to feed four easily. Sine it was just the two of us, I gladly took the leftovers home and it was every bit as good the next day.  We had some other dishes that were decent, but didn't come close to matching the corn or steak. The lobster and new potato corn chowder ($11) was thick and creamy with several large chunks of potatoes and lobster, but I didn't taste much corn. There was also some bacon in there which was chewy and gummy after sitting in the soup for god-knows-how-long.  The mixed greens salad with goat cheese ($12) was kinda blah.  We ordered oysters on the half shell ($16) and specifically told the waiter we wanted only the kusshi oysters after they told us the order usually is served with 3 kusshis and 3 cowboy(?) oysters (I honestly can't remember what type he said they were). They came back with the 3/3 split but brought out 3 more kusshis when we informed them of the error. I normally love kusshis but there was something about these that I wasn't crazy about... a weird aftertaste.  For a second side with our entree, we had the almondine green beans ($10) -- sauteed, with slivers of almonds... delicious.  The service was solid. There were three people waiting on us so drinks were always full and any issues we had were quickly dealt with.  The setting is gorgeous. Similar to the look of it's sister restaurant, T-Bones at Red Rock, it has a large fireplace and a contemporary, yet conservative decor. They have several comfy looking booths lining two sides of the room and if you aren't lucky enough to get one of those, the other tables have some uber-comfy chairs that'll help you settle into your food coma.  It is pricey (although slightly cheaper than the Strip) but a great value for what you get. We purchased a gift card from the weluvlocals.com site ($50 GC for $25) which helped reduce the cost. I used to think T-Bones and Twin Creeks (at the Silverton) were the top steak joints in the 'burbs, but Hank's is a clear cut above."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and phenomenal food! Unexpected gem in Henderson. Crab legs superb, prime rib best I've ever had and service exceptional. No bad choices here. Oh- and my daughter said best tater tots she has ever had----"}
{"text":"Dreamy scenery, with the warmth of the huge glassed-in fireplace contrasting nicely with the crystal chandeliers.   Excellent service, with our server explaining the menu to us in depth.   Good food. Not excellent, but good.   My one problem that I couldnt overlook and which really spoiled the whole experience for me was this:  Our waiter duped us into buying an entree.   Allow me to explain.   We told the waiter we wanted to split a meal. We werent that hungry and why pay for an extra plate if not necessary? We TOLD him this, and we were willing to pay a sharing fee or whatever.   So after he told us the specials, the last of which was a surf and turf that added on scallops for $15 or so, we gave him our steak order. The waiter says \"would you like to add on an order of scallops? Theyll complement the steak very well.\" I say \"ok\" assuming it would be an add-on.   Nope.   I got five (albiet very large) scallops. On a separate plate. We shared everything. And when tge bill came, those scallops werent $16, or $20, but THIRTY-EIGHT DOLLARS.   So what probably would have been four and a half stars turned into two. Left a VERY bad taste in my mouth.   I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Hank's Fine Steaks and Martinis is located inside Green Valley Ranch. It is an upscale restaurant and bar. After swimming at the pools there, we decided to eat somewhere. As we walked toward the exit, I saw there were advertising happy hour at Hank's so we decided to go check it out.  The atmosphere inside is sleek and elegant, with soft lighting and modern booths, and I especially like the illuminated bar top. We were able to get in wearing shorts, not sure if that was a good thing.  Happy Hour is from 4pm-7pm nightly in the bar/lounge area. Great half Price Martinis with reasonably priced Appetizers.   We had the Alaskan King Crab Cocktail that contains shaved Fennel, Herb Salad, Dijon Sauce and Tobiko. It was tasty and fresh. I also like the Lobster Gougeres.  I didn't care for the Crispy chicken and biscuits.   The server thought we only ordered the Crispy chicken and we waited for awhile then found out he didn't hear the rest of the order. He wasn't friendly.  We asked for the bread and they were soft and    made well. I was going to give it a three stars rating but my bf who has been to this place before loved this place so much, I decided to give it a 4 stars. Also I really liked the live entertainment, he was really good."}
{"text":"The food was delicious,service was above board and the atmosphere was great. Would recommend to any who would like to be pampered for an evening. Try the dry aged prime ribeye."}
{"text":"Dinner is phenomenal!!!  I can't afford to eat here a lot but when I do it has become our favorite 3 or 4 times a year.  BUT... Happy hour has become a favorite for my wife and I."}
{"text":"Here in Henderson for a convention. Chose this place for a dinner and was not disappointed! Started with some great crab cakes and an excellent 2006 vintage cab. The 8oz filet was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and the service from the staff was top notch!"}
{"text":"Unique off Strip steakhouse at the Green Valley Ranch Hotel. This place has it all: a great bar with a great bar menu, great service in a great setting and steaks as good as anywhere. The Chateaubriand is a gem on the menu. Their annual Easter Brunch is the best in town, but it only comes around once a year."}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with Hank's Steakhouse at the Green Valley Ranch.  Their Rib Eye is amazing and always cooked perfectly and the cream corn is to die for.. I never even thought I would like cream corn but the waiter convinced me to try it and now I don't know how I ever lived without it.   It's a little odd how they pull the entire table out so you can get into the seats but it is pretty comfortable.  The place is gorgeous and the staff is very nice.   I only wish I could afford to go there again!!"}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday.  The food was great.  The cocktails were pretty good, but not the best I have ever had.  Service was average.  We felt our server forgot about us a couple of times.  We would get half our order at a time.  We will go back, our server could have been having an off day."}
{"text":"Just ate here yesterday and the atmosphere is awesome but the food was way over salty.   The service was okay but yeah server was on our ass to make sure that we didn't go over our comp.  my group was like we can pay the difference.  Very weird!!  The things our group enjoyed were:  Lobster creams soup - Make sure to order it HOT.  Poke tuna- excellent  Fries - had to redo them because too salty  Porterhouse steak- good to the T   I would recommend this place but it needs to make sure to cook the food with more patience and less salt.  Service a little more training."}
{"text":"Almost walked out- so glad I didn't!  After waiting in the extremely loud walkway of the entrance where the bar is for 15 minutes past my reservation time... when we were early, I almost walked out and then I was taken to my table by a little girl who absolutely did NOT want to be there and never even smiled at all the whole night.  I was immediately extremely put off BUT the rest of the service and staff as well as the food was wonderful. Brandon, Bryan and Margo took great care of us.  Brandon was exceptional with suggestions on food and wine and he had a great personality.  In fact, save that one sad little hostess (not the main one at the counter, she was sweet) everyone had a great attitude; friendly, fun and engaging.   The head Sommelier, Diego was attentive and engaging and the chef came by to ensure we enjoyed our fish.  Neither manager ever stopped by the table but the staff that did were the ones we wanted tending to us.    First impression knocked it down to a 4.... once we sat down it was a 5 all the way."}
{"text":"Absolutely Devine. I started with the steakhouse salad, awesome!  My husband had the crab cocktail as appetizer, huge...  My entree was perfectly cooked and beautiful presentation.  Dover sole was so delish and my husbands loved the filet mignon, we shared the horseradish mashed potatoes and asparagus with olive oil and garlic.  The head waiter, and his staff were attentive and professionals. They anticipated all our needs. Highly recommend this jewel of a restaurant inside Green Valley Ranch Resort. Thank your for being part of a very romantic date night"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times.  The food is always good.  Not great, good.  I usually hit TBones in Summerlin.  TBones is always right on.  Hank's can take a lesson from TBones.    I ordered the petite filet.  I ordered it medium rare.  The steak was served to me rare..borderline raw.  It was chewy.  I told my server and he politely and understandingly took it back for a little more fire.  The filet was returned....possibly a new piece if meat.  As I started into it, all was fine.  However, once I hit the center, it was raw....again.  The server cleaned plates and asked me how everything was.  Now, the remains of a raw piece of meat on my plate should be a red flag.  But it wasn't.  I told him that the center was raw and he.....apologized and asked if we wanted dessert.  No thanks!  Here is my takeaway....  Stick with TBones.  Service at Hank's is ok, but the servers need a lesson on \"plate clues\".   If there is a raw piece of meat on the plate, figure something is up and don't just jump to dessert.  Offer a free dessert, offer to take the raw piece of meat off the bill.  Neither happened.  Stick to TBones!!! I"}
{"text":"Overall, very nice atmosphere, excellent service and hosts.  Plate presentations were disappointing.  Meat on plate looked plain and in the case of the filet, very small. Overall the food was very good but not out of this world as one might expect from the prices and expectations.  Service was the best we've had in Vegas in 2 years here.  The value was good...maybe a veggie or potato added to the plate or a small side would boost the presentation.  Managers engaged as well."}
{"text":"A bit pricy but excellent service. I took my friend here for a girls night out dinner. The steaks were perfectly prepared and oysters fresh. The service is great. Decor is upscale, dark and a good date night environment."}
{"text":"Yes - it is delicious.  The filet mignon is tasty and seasoned.  My steak had a little melted butter on it or you can have some melted blue cheese on it - either way (and I have had both)...its amazing).  Nice and dark like a good fancy steakhouse should be - I enjoy the atmosphere and the ambiance.  The wait staff is nice and thorough and although it is expensive, you get what you pay for...its GREAT!"}
{"text":"Wow.... Hanks is where we choose for a special dinner. Unbeatable service atmosphere food and drinks. Top notch."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular spots. My most recent visit really confirmed how amazing service can be. My husband and I hadn't been to Hanks in a few months but we went for a drink at the bar. Bart, the bartender recognized us and asks: Oban Neat and Cosmopolitan? Where everybody knows your name.... Seamless. and it's consistent every time."}
{"text":"This girl loves a great steak.  Hank's was our first dinner at GVR with a few coworkers and clients. It sure hit the spot with atmosphere similar to El Gaucho but with a more contemporary twist. The space is warmed up by a modern fireplace and beautiful crystal chandeliers.   Service was impeccable. This gentleman made my mouth water every time he described a dish, a cut of meat, or the house specials. He knew every ingredient and did not hesitate to offer a complimenting martini or a glass of wine. Attentive just enough and engaging.  Talk about a proper steak: Hank's cuts are all prime and hand cut, with grass fed options available as well. Our dinner consisted of the following:  - Carpaccio of beef: always one of my favorites, the meat plays center stage, with just a touch of good olive oil, capers and micro greens.  - Petite Filet: prepared Rare plus, ahmazing, the steak melted in my mouth, it was accentuated by just a touch of salt and pepper, so I could really taste the flavor and texture of this cut. A little bit of peppercorn sauce on the side.  - Steamed asparagus: bottom half of the stalks are shaved for perfect tenderness.  - Rotisserie Chicken: This is a whole chicken. Crispy, seasoned skin and juicy flesh all around.  - Mashed potatoes: super creamy, with a touch of garlic.  Cucumber martini was a fresh start to the meal, followed by a glass of malbec.  Delightful experience from start to finish. If you end up at GVR you absolutely have to eat at Hank's."}
{"text":"Saturday night prior to the 3 Doors Down concert at GVR we had reservations at Hanks which we normally enjoy.   We arrived a bit early to take advantage of their Happy Hour and the bartender made the most delicious pear martini's. The bar & lounge area quickly filled up and within a short time it was standing room only. So, if you're looking to enjoy Happy Hour be sure to get there early!   Once we were seated our server introduced himself and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu items and explaining what items were not available because of quality issues. They also finally introduced a non-seafood appetizer which delighted my husband who doesn't like seafood. I opted for the crab cakes which, although good, it took me a bit to warm up to as they were not traditional crab cakes but more like soft lumps of crab molded into a round cake form but not baked or pan seared like I would have expected (or maybe they were just not cooked long enough). For my entree I ordered the Seafood Jackpot which I always order and thoroughly enjoy. This time, though, I was disappointed: the oysters were super small, my crab claws were still somewhat frozen and the shrimp and lobster tail tasted like they had been sitting on ice too long. The lump crab was very good but certainly didn't make up for the price paid for the entree. For my husband who likes steak but prefers it well done, he listened to the servers suggestion and got a bone-in steak instead of the filet he would have normally ordered and requested to have it butterflied to ensure it was cooked through. He was also disappointed and didn't finish his steak.  He mentioned it didn't have much flavor and was a lot more red than he would normally preferred. He said the best part of his dinner was his baked potato.   Although we've enjoyed Hanks in the past we're not really certain that we'll be going back for dinner since it's supposed to be a high end restaurant and this time, other than the pear martini,  it was beyond disappointing especially for the price."}
{"text":"DANGGGGG this place is nice and of course pricey!  But for Fine dining in Vegas its great!  We ordered a variety of appetizers, entrees and sides along with a few bottles of wine and champagne!   The food was amazing.  I recommend the salmon and the baked yam!  OHHH I was in love!!!   The service was great, very attentive and on top of the wine pouring!    I will make it back to Hanks when there is another special occasion to celebrate!"}
{"text":"After a disastrous meal at the GVR Cafe, The Better Half and I went searching for some desserts.  We browsed all of the menus around the property and decided to give this place a try.  I asked the hostess if the desserts were good here and she said \"Absolutely, especially the Fried Oreos!\".....Fried Oreos?!!!  Sold!  Since we just ate dinner, we saddled up to the bar, ordered a couple of glasses of Wine and the following desserts:  Fried Oreos, $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson?select=Fr6o_W_g8jRLTOy1xV966A#Fr6o_W_g8jRLTOy1xV966A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson?select=UDuyjS-PR-QMefJCeCiRZQ#UDuyjS-PR-QMefJCeCiRZQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson?select=QArOEViaXlGNlALYT_4ltQ#QArOEViaXlGNlALYT_4ltQ  Chocolate Cake, $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/green-valley-ranch-grand-cafe-henderson?select=rFCV6YBghUVpNiiND6VEbQ#rFCV6YBghUVpNiiND6VEbQ  Let's start with the Fried Oreos....they are A-W-E-S-O-M-E....!!!  The Oreos are surrounded by a fluffy, Doughnut shell and come with a Creamy Dipping Sauce....when you mix the two together and bite into it, you feel a slight crunch from the Cookie of the Oreo....then all of the flavors combine in your mouth to take you to nirvana....yes, it's that good!  Trust me.  The Chocolate Cake is pretty amazing too.  However, I've had great Chocolate Cakes before.  What sets this place apart is the Fried Oreos.  It's so addicting that we stopped here every night of our stay to have them.  It's a must try if you're in the area.  Return Factor - 100% (as long as the Fried Oreos are on the menu)"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and felt like I definitely needed more of something else. Usually not the case after an actually happy happy hour.  Super busy on a Friday around 6 (to be expected), but we found 2 seats at the bar pretty quickly, which was great.  The service was pretty sub-par. Our server asked us what we wanted to drink way before giving us the extensive happy hour menu. Kinda weird. She wasn't very attentive or welcoming either. Stars off for boo bear. She woulda been cute if she ever smiled.  Both martinis I got were good. Peachy Apple was wayyyyy more potent than the Koi, though. Wonder what was up with that.  We ordered the chicken and biscuits and sliders. Chicken dish was good, but it was literally 2 fried chicken wings and one mini biscuit with an obscure white gravy. Pretty darn expensive to be slicing a tiny piece of bread down the middle to share. The sliders were lukewarm and kinda soggy. Would not ever get those again.  Although this place is more like a loud and crowded bar for over 40s than a legit steakhouse setup, I think I need to come back for an actual steak next time. The live music consisted of a fake Adele singing stuff like \"Sweet Caroline\" into a rhinestone encrusted mic...Very weird for the setting. Hopefully the service will be much much better when I give this joint another chance. I'll be sure to bring my coupon from the mailbox!"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a birthday celebration and lucky for us it was Las Vegas Restaurant week.....decisions, decisions...oh, where to go.  We finally decided on a steakhouse which our friends had heard great things at Hank's in Green Valley Ranch.  Being a Yelper, I did my research and we made reservations the day of.  We were not disappointed.  The entire dining experience was fabulous.  The ambiance of Hank's is so decadent.  Love, love, love the lighting.   The hostesses who sat us was friendly and the table she sat us was lovely.   Am I getting too melancholy?  Our table was fabulous!  It was roomy for 4, great lighting over a gorgeous chanderlier...the staff of 3 immediately was attentive.  At this point, they were now informed it was my birthday.  The 3 amigos appeared and made the night special.    They read all the specials, but again we knew what we wanted from their planned 3 course menu.  It was the petite filet mignon, wedge salad and a dessert.   We all got the petite filet mignon which was out of this world.  We decided on getting 2 extra sides the mashed and roasted baby shiitakes.  Oh baby.....  The whole dining experience was so incredible, attention to every detail.  We ordered a beautiful bottle of wine and the bill still came out 400.00+....remember, we all got the set price of 50.00 bucks per person for the 3 courses.  As I read another Yelper mention you have to forget about the price if you eat here.  I will say, it was a bargain if you try during restaurant week.    This is my only my 2nd 5 star rating....."}
{"text":"Hands down this Resturante was the best experience I've ever had in the area!   Visiting from LA, and knowing want \"good food\" taste like, I felt like home at Hanks.    Since I'm more on the 'healthy eating side' of eating, we ordered the Fried Chicken, Lol! Broccoli with out the sauce, and the mushrooms. It was absolutely delicious! Never even expected the chicken to be so tender, and it melted in your mouth. Yum! As I write this review I'm still thinking about the chicken.... I think it was the Sage gravy that's it for me, too!!   We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for about the fifth time.  Always excellent food and service.  My steak has always been cooked perfectly.  Appetizers, sides and deserts are excellent.  Hank's versus the chains like Ruth Chris is a night and day difference.  My favorite special occasion place.  Be sure and order the lobster mac and cheese as a side."}
{"text":"One of my fav places!  Love the martini's here! Plenty of specialties to choose from and they shake 'em up like crazy! Love those little ice chips in a freshly shaken martini :)   The steaks are absolutely perfect! And the sides...delish!  This place is great! Love the swanky atmosphere and amazing martinis :-)"}
{"text":"I've stopped by here a few times after work for half-off martinis during happy hour, but I finally decided to sit down and dine for the first time recently - unfortunately, that was a mistake. The food quality was good but dishes were not well-prepared, the service was poor, and they basically charge Strip prices. What's the point of a spot in a locals casino that doesn't seem to offer locals any benefit over Strip restaurants - maybe people who live around here just really don't want to drive to the Strip? Unfortunately that's also no plus for me, as I don't live in the area.  To expand slightly - I ordered the ribeye, which was good but was overcooked (ordered medium rare, came out medium - maybe even medium plus). My party got the mac and cheese, potatoes, and creamed corn sides and I thought all tasted fine but they were served at best lukewarm. I did really like the lobster chowder soup I got, though. But overall, while stuff tasted fine, it was not cooked right.  Service was not good. There were long delays for everything - to be seated, to get our menus, to order, to get refills, to get the check, etc. etc. Really gave the impression that the waitstaff didn't care. And our waiter was pretty pretentious too. I was surprised by this given that this place is targeted more towards locals, but the attitudes felt worse here than a lot of Strip restaurants I've been to.  I'll still consider coming back for happy hour, but there's no chance I'll pay Strip prices for such a lacking dinner product and experience. Even if avoiding the Strip, there are a lot better places across the valley to go to for steak."}
{"text":"While on a business trip to Las Vegas with my colleagues we went to enjoy a nice dinner at Hank's. The dinner plate and the martinis were amazing. I had three Koi martini and they were out of this world. The 24oz steak I ordered was too much for me to handle but it was done to perfection. We all enjoyed the night and home to return on our next trip out there."}
{"text":"Very beautiful restaurant, food was good. The scallops are always my favorite but the lamb was also delicious. Great local steakhouse."}
{"text":"Giving the place three stars only for the service and the chop salad. Went in for our anniversary and had the wagyu steak and lobster tail. 10 oz steak and 28oz tail, salad, two sides and desert. Steak really didn't have much flavor, lobster tail was under cooked as were the green beans, asparagus was just ok.  After bringing the undercooked food to their attention everyone stepped up to the plate and made it right. Was obvious they felt bad about the problem as it was our anniversary dinner , everyone came to the table to apologize and comp'd most of the meal. So for that I commend them. The wait staff was Great very attentive and professional. We will give the place another try, as we all have off days, and the place is nice for an upscale evening."}
{"text":"LR made reservations here for our party of 4. She and ER have been here before and said the steaks and service were very good. Similar to other steakhouses, our waiter let us know he had a party of 3 that would take care of us, including Denise and Jose.   Hanks Fine Steaks & Martinis, is located in Green Valley Resort Casino. The atmosphere upon entering the restaurant is definitely upscale with a tendency on glitzy with huge chandeliers! Except for the occasional loud noise from the front bar, the evening was relaxing and very enjoyable.  There is a huge martini list separate from the regular libations menu. We seriously pondered ordering martinis, but instead the consensus was to order a bottle of Prosecco.   I ordered the 8 oz Grass fed Filet Mignon, ER ordered the same, LR ordered the Classic 8 oz petite Filet and HL got the Classic 11 oz Filet.  We started with a lovely complimentary basket of warm yeast rolls, sliced baguette and cheese flat bread that came with herb and sea salt topped soft butter slab atop a pool of olive oil. We devoured it quickly and requested a second basket.  To begin we all shared the well named \"Kitchen Sink\" Caesar Salad (romaine Hearts, Shrimp, tomatoes, croutons, hearts of palm and Avocado with a spicy horseradish dressing) - yummy, and the traditional beef steak tomato fresh mozzarella salad - tomatoes were beautiful in color and ripeness, the fresh mozzarella creamy and smooth like it should be, drizzled with balsamic reduction.  For our sides we selected fresh sautéed baby spinach with roasted garlic, mushrooms (crimini, royal trumpet, maitake, enoki and bourbon), and creamed corn). I am not a creamed corn fan, but everyone else enjoyed it a lot.  ER'a steak was a bit too red for his medium well request, so he sent it back to be grilled a bit longer. All of the rest of our steaks were perfect and delicious! Several added extra side sauces to their steaks too, which they enjoyed.  We eyed several humongous slices of carrot cake being served to tables around us and watching those patrons eat it all up, which meant it was that good.  We opted not to order dessert, because none of us had an ounce of room for it.  I would definitely come back here again and recommend Hanks Fine Steaks & Martinis to others."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Hank's and decided it was time to give it a try.  I arrived at my reservation time and was led to my table.  I was pleased where it was because the bar area was very loud with music and conversation from the happy hour crowd.  The hostess took me to the second of two dining room areas from the bar.  The sound here was still lively but it was a more sedate area.  A server came and took my order for an iced tea and it was brought quickly.  I had looked at the menu online so I knew what my order would be.  I opted for the lobster chowder--the star of the meal--the 16 ounce Niman Ranch New York, and French fries for a side.  The lobster chowder was excellent.  The bowl as extremely hot,  The chowder had pieces of lobster on top and throughout and the broth was rich.  There were also small, cubed potatoes, corn, and bacon pieces.  I would get this again.  After a good amount of time, my steak was brought.  There was no discernible seasoning on the steak and I had to salt it.  While I use a large amount of salt, I rarely need to salt steak.  The steak was very rare--I ordered it blue so I was pleased that it wasn't overcooked.  The amount of fries was a bit surprising because sides are where steakhouses go crazy with large portions.  This was more like a serving of fries in a burger joint.  It also came with dill ketchup.  I am not a user of ketchup but I tried it to see what difference the dill made.  Where's the dill to paraphrase a burger commercial of years ago.  Dessert was their chocolate pistachio soufflé.  The server said it would only be a short time which was surprising because there had been no notice on the menu of the soufflé taking extra time.  I imagine they pre-make and quickly bake the soufflé because it was out in about 10 minutes.  The soufflé is chocolate into which the server pours the pistachio crème Anglaise.  The flavors were good but the soufflé wasn't as light and airy as others I've had and I attribute it to the pre-made idea.  Sevrice was very good.  My iced tea glass was replaced with a fresh one as soon as it was near empty.  The room is pleasant with a lot of crystal.  The meal was OK but certainly not worth the price.  It was Strip pricing and the chef needs to season steaks some.  Green Valley Ranch is a distance away from where I live.  When I eat there in the future it will be at one of the other restaurants."}
{"text":"Hanks is delicious!  Nice variety of options on the steaks and good sides.  Everything we got was good and expensive."}
{"text":"We had a great experience last night with our family!(party of 8) I started with a kettle one martini with blue cheese stuffed olives- perfect! We had a little bit of everything. The shrimp cocktail was colossal, while the oysters were tasty they were a bit small. The lobster bisque soup was the best I've ever had and the French onion soup and heart of palm salad were also both on the must try list. 6 of us had steak of some sort. I had the bone on filet (amazing) we had steaks cooked from rare to well and all we perfectly cooked. All in all a great experience. If I had to say something negative the only improvement I would be able to recommend is the bartender uniforms were far to slutty for  a classy establishment. Will go back."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  Best burger ever. Great martinis. Wonderful service!! Go early if you want a seat. It's not unusual for there to be a line before they open at 4pm, especially on the weekend. Don't miss this place!!!"}
{"text":"OK.. Great Steaks.  Great Service !  Great place.  Thanks Michael for the service.    As I was sitting there enjoying my meal,  A rotund hairy man with a t shirt , shorts,and flip flops is seated.  Really?  Cant take the time to put on shoes?  This place is too nice for that.  Hanks. I realize times are tough, but no reason to let the riff raff in."}
{"text":"For the bar area only: Decor is beautiful.  Ambience is nice - the place is small, so you feel like you're somewhere away from the bustle of the casino and everything. It's quiet inside and the small bar is usually surrounded, but you can still find seats. It makes you feel like you're having a drink in a really swanky steakhouse (which you are!) Drinks are delicious - a good selection of martinis and of course beers/wines for those types, too! Prices - this is the best part. Half off all martinis during happy hour (5-7 EVERY DAY! and 9-11 Mon-Thurs).  It's not a place I want to hang out all night, but I do love stopping by there for a couple martinis before heading somewhere else (or for an after-work drink)"}
{"text":"My husband and I had our annual pre-Thanksgiving dinner at Hank's on Wednesday, November 25 with my mother, our two sons and one of their girlfriends.  We sat in Margot's section.  The reason for my note is twofold:  (1) to say that Margot was terrific.  She was so attentive to all of us and our needs.  We were there for darn near 3 hours and we never felt rushed at all; as a matter of fact, our dinner was so leisurely, we all totally enjoyed ourselves, the food and the service.  (2) I also want to mention our absolute delight in the sommelier, Joseph Hoth.  He is very, very knowledgeable and was extremely helpful to us when making our selections.  Our wine bill alone was pretty high so you know that he was very interested in our selections and made sure they were all properly decanted and poured.  He even went so far as to save for me the empty bottles and the corks from each of them.  One of our sons is quite versed in wine and he and Mr. Hoth had a terrific time talking about the different types, vintages, etc.  Food was wonderful as were the side dishes.  Everything came out as we requested it and it was all hot.  After dinner drinks, coffee and desserts were enjoyed by us all.  We always appreciate the attention paid to us and to the details surrounding our meals."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, perfect ambience for a lovely night. I got the grass fed filet mignon and a bunch of sides. I enjoyed the sides more than the steak. The Mac and chess, green peas, Tatar tots, and mash potatoes were delicious. We finished it off with some complimentary desserts. My favorite is the lemon tart."}
{"text":"Never been to Hanks.  Stopped by Hanks with a friend and heard the live music. We stopped by and the amosphere was great. We had some drinks. Drinks were great and live music was awesome. Def stop by. Happy hour awesome too."}
{"text":"We used to love this place so much but over the last year the food and service has gone way downhill. We used to love their happy hour menu which is now half the items it used to be at half the quality and quantity. Not quite sure if new management has taken over or hat but it has for sure gone downhill."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Steaks in Vegas! The Chateau Briand is incredibly flavorful, moist and incredibly delicious. The atmosphere at the bar is vibrant and exciting, with live music almost every night!"}
{"text":"Kristine, my \"lil sis\" from college and I were treating ourselves to a nice dinner (during our weekend away in Vegas)... and Hank's looked like the perfect spot for our night out.   Upon walking in the dimly lit dining room, I was impressed by the decor, and the plethora of servers busily running around the dining room.  As we were escorted to the very back of the dining room, we joked that we were being sat at the kids table....still the ambiance was relaxing, and the drink menu was abundant. I ordered a Brassy Blonde martini, a spin on my favorite pineapple martini which didn't live up to it's predecessor, but still - it was tasty and tart.  The basket of bread they sat in front of us was warm and had a great variety to settle our appetites while we waited for one 1 of the 3 servers that were assigned to take care of our table.  Now THAT's service!    We ordered:  The Chopped Salad (and split it between us) 2 petite filets (mine with a Gorgonzola crust) A side of creamed corn (and split it between us) A side of jumbo baked yam (and split it between us)  The salad arrived - small portions split on two plates between us.  It was delicious UNTIL I bit down on something SUPER hard and sharp. OUCH!  Seriously, I thought I broke my tooth. When I removed the item, it looked and felt like part of my tooth... Kristine called the server over, and he called the manager over to see what it was that I had bitten.  It was a sharp piece of crab shell!  In my salad!  Thank God I'm not allergic to shell fish because it could have been a much bigger issue.  Anyway, I digress.  The manager asked if I needed medical attention... but after feeling my tooth - I told him that while it hurt, it didn't feel like it was broken... so he comped our salad, and we moved on.  I decided to order a glass of red wine to complement my steak and requested it prior to our steaks being delivered....  The steaks came out - and while mine was perfect, Kristine's was super over done.  The server noticed, and insisted on bringing her a new steak - and that it was only take \"1 minute, 1 minute, 1 minute\" so I kept eating mine... as she still had the sides to munch on.  10+ minutes later, my steak is gone, and hers was just re-arriving. This time it was perfect, but so much for dining together...and my glass of wine was just arriving by this point. (Side note, the cream corn and the yams were both excellent)  So now we're both stuffed and ready to go into food coma mode... even with my sore jaw/tooth but the server insisted once again, that he bring us dessert.   We chose the molten lava cake... which was rich, gooey inside and a little dry on the outside... EH.  Not the best I've had... but it was a nice gesture.   So...almost $200.00 later, the two of us bid farewell to the steakhouse at Green Valley Ranch Resort....and I didn't think I'd think much of it again... it was good food, great service but not necessarily a place I'd go back to.....  Now fast forward a week later.... I am snacking on a piece of bread (SOFT BREAD) and I hear a crunch.  My tooth broke in half!!! The same tooth that I injured during my dinner at Hank's - eating a chopped salad!  Seriously?    Looks like I'm heading to the dentist... UGH!"}
{"text":"What an Experience!  First off, the ambiance. Nice soft live music in the background. Modern looking fireplace walls separating the bar from the dining room area. Big, roomy,, comfortable booths, white tablecloths, dim lighting but not so dim that you can't read the menu.  The Service.:Our waiter, Brian, was the best. Friendly, personable,  and ready to make suggestions without being obnoxious.  The Food: We started with the Tuna Poke which was delicious (fresh seafood in the desert, wow). We then had a Caesar's salad with the right amount of dressing  and shaved Parmesan.  Next came the 24 ounce bone-in rib eye which my wife and I split. They bring out the steak on a cart and carve it table side. That was a nice touch. Best steak I have had in a long time. Nice crust on the outside and tender, soft, and juicy on the inside. It literally melted in your mouth. For a side, we ordered the grilled tomatoes with spinach and cheese, delicious. We ordered a bottle of Syrah which complemented the food really well.  In talking with Brian we told him we had recently celebrated our 25th anniversary. He brought out a chocolate lava cake with a scoop of ice cream. My wife was in heaven!  Yes, it is expensive, but it is worth it. In short, one of the best meals I have had in a long time. Can't wait to head back out to Henderson for a steak fix."}
{"text":"In little old Suburbia Henderson there's a few fine dining restaurants that one can eulogize. Hank's Fine Steaks and Martinis located in Green Valley Ranch Casino is a lovely spot. Typical steaks and seafood, some poultry choices, loads of delicious sides and sweet desserts. And, of course, the martini menu. There's a full bar, beer, wine, spirits and a speciality martini menu.  Food ordered; crab salad (fresh, tender, perfect), rotisserie chicken (juicy, succulent), hubs had a 22 oz rib eye (he said it was good), sweet potatoes fries(dusted in cinnamon flour), chopped steakhouse salad (good), and creme brûlée with fresh berries for dessert (sweet vanilla cream custard with burnt-marshmallow sugar coating, raspberries, strawberries and blueberries kissed with sugar sprinkles, heavenly...) Service was great, we had two waiters which were attentive and friendly.  I had my usual cocktail, hubby got a Hank's Martini.  Total, minus tip was $196.  Ambiance is slightly upscale, a good place for either a date or business dinner.  Out in the bar there's a live musician playing renditions of The Fray or Dave Matthews Band, he's very good. This was my second time there at Hank's, can't say if it was the same musician as before, either way, he's good.  Would return again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me to Hanks for a lovely birthday dinner and we loved it. They have our very favorite wine, Justin's Cabernet Sauvignon! We shared their steak which was huge and delicious. Server was very attentive but then again, it's an expensive place so i expect the service to be up to par."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been to Hanks in the past and thoroughly enjoyed it. Unfortunately tonight was different.   We came to Hanks to celebrate our anniversary, expecting a great meal. This was not the case. I ordered the grass fed filet, rare. It came out medium so I had to send it back. After some time, they brought back a new steak that was cooked properly, but when I took my first bite I was disappointed. The steak had zero flavor. Couldn't even taste salt and pepper on the steak. The only flavor was char from the flash fried outside. Feeling guilty now, we doused it in their complementary glaze they provided on the side and toughed it down.     After they brought it a second time, the server's assistant ignored us the rest of the meal. Probably so they wouldn't have to take back another steak. Once we finished, she came back and said, \"I assume this one was much better?\" Feeling guilt and dissatisfaction, we just said yes so we could move on and end our meal.   In addition to our steak, we ordered scallops, crab cakes, mushrooms, and soufflé for desert. The crab cakes were decent. The scallops were good. The mushrooms were weak. The soufflé was not very tasty. All in all, for the amount of money spent, a very disappointing meal.   I will say that the service was good, although the server's assistant could have been better.   All in all, we will not be returning to Hanks. For the amount of money required to dine there, many alternatives are available such as The M steakhouse, Flemming's, Michael's, etc.  For those looking for a fine steakhouse you may want to take Hanks off the list until they can start providing a better product."}
{"text":"Love the martinis at Hanks but the pregnant bartender is so unfriendly and rude.  Never smiled once and we always had to seek out her attention to get another drink.  And then asked multiple times for the check to pay.  Never a good experience when you have to beg to spend your money and the service is unfriendly and mediocre.  Won't be back unless a new bartender is found.  New Years resolution is to not return to businesses who have rude employees.  Tired of bad and rude service.  Won't be back.  Left a 10% gratuity...we are normally 20 percenters.  And we are locals.....bad for repeat business.  Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere in Henderson.  Anyone can make a martini.  If you find yourself at Hanks and she is the bartender.....run!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Great food, music, !!!! Fantastic!!!! Was promptly seated. Waiter was courteous. Food came in a timely fashion and treated with respect..."}
{"text":"My favorite steak house because of the martinis. The hostesses dress are so nice. My lady's at the bar...WONDERFUL!!! Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"I think Hank's does a pretty fine job of making a steak and definitely does an AWESOME  job of making some yummy delicious martinis! Surprisingly with all my days at the District and GVR, I've never been to Hank's. We were invited to my company's Holiday dinner and with 10 of us, they sat us in the back room. It was a nice intimate place with cool decor and we had the whole room  to ourselves!  I started off with the Hank's Signature Salad and the hubby started off with the Tuna Tartare. My salad was good, a lil on the over bearing on the dressing. Tuna tartare was decent, nothing to run home and Yelp about. We both went with the Bone In Rib Eye (originally I wanted the Prime Rib, but they were out....boo =(!!!) I definitely liked how they provided different types of sauces to accompany the steak, real horseradish sauce, Bearnaise sauce, etc. Steak was cooked to my liking and tender, but I barely put a dent in it. All their steaks are PRIME as they mention when they hand you the menu. The sides were my favorite, garlic mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, asparagus, sauteed spinach and mushrooms. Someone ordered a baked potato and I liked how they provided a couple of side items, bacon, chives, sour cream, etc. I finished off the company dinner with a creme brulee. Huge portion of yummyness with fruit! My favorite item of the night was the KOI martini...which I could probably drink like water if only it wasn't so strong!   Service was very attentive and I think for the price you pay, you definitely get your money's worth! I will be back Hank's!"}
{"text":"Great Place...So yummy Rick was a amazing server  Jose was a Amazing Chef and kind. Management team was great"}
{"text":"Love Hank's so so so much. A classic stop for a nice date night with the wife. The beef carpaccio -- when on the menu -- is to die for. Great service; great steaks; great martinis.   And, not to be overlooked, it is not on the Strip! One of my top few locals steakhouses."}
{"text":"Dined at Hanks when I stayed at the GVR. The service was good- I think the server had a cold. They were out of the Niman Filet, I ordered the strip instead- not a good choice. When the food came out the steak was a cold, the sides- asparagus and mushrooms were perfect. Ordered the salt caramel profiteroles- it was delicious! Place is beautiful and spotless, but when you drop $200 plus for dinner, hot food should hot.  If I'm staying at the GVR in the future, I'd probably pass on Hanks."}
{"text":"Environment was beautiful!  Way more than what was expected.  We passed thru this place so many times and only saw the entrance. But the inside was so romantic.  Our food was outstanding!  And our 3yr old was able to handle the sophistication. Lol. Mac and cheese, baby! I ordered the special...filet mignon w cherry and wine reduction and mashed potatoes w bacon/jalapeño and shrimp. THE BEST!  MY HUSBAND DOESN'T EAT STEAK AND HE WAS FIGHTING WITH ME FOR MORE. It was definitely worth it.  They split our losber chowder...a must! So much lobster. This was the first place that neither one of us could finish our plate...app, salad, main course. Definate romantic environment."}
{"text":"there is no redemption here! wow the level, first was the Happy Hour wine, 10 bucks & flat as a pancake, then the bar ambience, hmmm, flat as a pancake, so 2 strikes you are almost out, now comes the good part....the bill, cause I wanted to get the hell outta there, give them cash and they do their own thing on it whatever makes their cash handling easierl, ok I get it but I just asked for an actual receipt with the exact amount on it, response? two bimbos one a female one a male, kept trying to tell me that the change was the same so who cares  what the bill says, and do I know math?, WOW, are you kidding, umm I got a calculator but it wasn't my point here herp derp. Now Im getting rid of Mr.( I bartend so I'm a rocket scientist), &  called for manager, he shows up drunk and about 23, Lawd above here we go, the state of the world in jeopardy when all these self entitled kids run the ship. as I explained he  nodded his head and kept asking about the math?? wtf, I finally said just go back to your whiskey and try to endure your pathetic job here in this pathetic place. Went across the way told them the story they comped a glass of great wine and were just so cool! so ready.....wine, flat, ambience, flat, service so flat a granny boob is more robust, 3 strikes you are so out, umm buh bye"}
{"text":"We arrived at 7 PM to a busy and crowded restaurant. The decor is beautiful and elegant. Our party of 4 were seated in a very comfortable booth. Our server greeted us and we placed our beverage ordered as he provided our menus. Two in our party ordered the wedge salad. A generous portion with a flavorful creamy blue cheese dressing. Another choice was the onion soup. Nicely seasoned with a slight hint of sherry and a sharp cheese garnish. My shrimp cocktail comprised of four large gulf shrimp and a tangy cocktail sauce. One entree consisted of a filet mignon. It was well prepared and nicely seasoned. The other three in our party ordered the bone-in New York strip. It was tender, seasoned perfectly and came to us at the perfect medium rare temperature. The side dishes of mushrooms and escalloped potatoes were generous and tasty. The desserts we selected were the deep fried Oreos - delicious - and a Carmel toffee cake - outstanding! Gracious attentive service was provided by the entire staff."}
{"text":"My review is for happy hour.  I kept hearing about this place and thought I would finally make my way in since I live so darn close.   It was a short walk from the escalators for the theater, and it seemed primarily composed of bar type seating.  Nice comfy chairs, elligent decor, and  purse hooks which really make a big difference for us ladies... Or men who enjoy purses.    My first fatal error upon arriving at 4:10 was not realizing happy hour only included drinks until 4pm, and at 5pm small plates could then be ordered. I arrived very hungry.  So since alcohol was all that could be consumed my lightweight self became very inebriated by 5pm.  My favorite martini was the blackberry.  Not artificial tasting,  the basil balanced the sweetness,  just a yummy drink.  My second favorite was the peach apple,  but my friend had the fat Elvis I believe,  and that was to sweet for me.   With the half off discount most martinis are about 7 to 8 dollars,  and they fill that glass super full. I appreciated the glass was chilled.   They also have reduced cost wine  for happy hour.     Now the small plates for happy hour were definatly small,  and compared to other happy hours I really love like brio or Soho,  they were a bit overpriced.  Most averaging 10 dollars. This is the main reason I'm marking off one star.     The beef rib was tender and we'll flavored, but not much meat on the single 9 dollar rib.  It was served with some mash potato puree and a couple roasted veggies.     The lobster puffs had no actual peices of lobster more a  puree they piped into the puffs .    The fried chicken and chedder biscuits were nice, and the most fillings option.  Tender and crispy,  and I always love a good biscuit.   We also ordered two desserts which were not on the happy hour menu.  The chocolate souffle with pistachio sauce: not bad,  but it didn't blow my mind.  The cheesecake :huge slice could feed an army,    nice and creamy,  could use more of a sauce or fruit for its size.   Overall the service was attentive, which I appreciated.  The crowd that ate their was more on the 50 plus side,  so we were definitely the odd men out.  Ill make sure to come 10 till 5  next time so there are still ample seating,  but I can eat sooner than later."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have been to this steakhouse in the Green Valley Casino. The first time we sat in the dining room, and this time we sat in the bar area during happy hour.  I asked for a lemon drop martini which was not on the Martini menu, and they still gave me half price.  We noticed others were getting bread around us and we did not receive any, it turns out that you have to ask for it, so that's a good tip for all the Yelp readers! We ordered two steaks, asparagus and mushrooms for our main course and a mixed chopped salad to start.  The salad had avocado and hearts of palm which were good, but then we tasted a shrimp that was definitely old and we couldn't eat any more.  They just cleared our unfinished salads away without asking why we didn't eat them.  They brought a pork chop instead of one of the steaks, and the waitress said that she thought I said pork chop instead of filet mignon...she was way off.  Mushrooms are overcooked in wine and asparagus is tough I think because it was not peeled, I always peel mine at home.  Just too many little things went wrong to give it any more than three stars."}
{"text":"Had the oysters served on an impressive blue ice lit water bowl. Savoured a chateaubriand for 2 with a variety of veggies. Its probably enough for 4 persons if an appetizer is ordered. Enjoyed it with peppercorn, a cilantro and a horseradish gravy, but the meat did not need it. Liked the bread selection, seeded bread was my fave. We had 3 men serving our wishes. Beautiful chandeliers and gas flame features decorate the sleek decor. Busy and beautiful steak restaurant."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't write such a negative review, but this is the worst restaurant I have ever eaten at in my entire life. This review is for both a dinner experience and for Easter brunch.   I wanted to like this place so much. Here's what they do have going for them. The location is great, it's less than 10 minutes from my house and GVR is easy to get into and navigate. The decor and ambiance in Hank's is amazing, very swanky and classy.   I'll start with my dinner experience. My husband made reservations for dinner on a Friday night. We look over the menu and are intrigued by the drink offerings so we both order a drink and the bread basket comes out. The drinks are tasty and creative, the bread basket variety is nice so I'm happy so far. We both order a steak and some sides. Then we sit and wait...and wait some more. Meanwhile the table next to us is complaining about their food. I assume the woman is just a complainer and write it off. Then our food arrives and I realize what all the complaining is about. Our steaks were the worst steaks I've ever had. I'm not saying they were the worst steaks from a fine dining restaurant either. I would be disgruntled if I had been served these same steaks at Applebee's. My husband and I both ordered medium steaks and they both contained uncooked areas in the middle. I'm not talking rare....completely uncooked. I mean steaks is in the title and they can't even get that right. At this point we'd waited so long that we just ate what we could and vowed to never return.   Flash forward to Easter. I decide that because of all the reasons that I wanted to like this restaurant that we must give it another try. We make reservations and are seated. The hostess was very friendly and gave us a warm welcome. We ordered  the deviled eggs to start and the waiting begins. After 45 minutes we have an appetizer. It looks like the service is just like last time. The waiter apologizes and says the kitchen is behind, but based on our last experience we know this is the norm. Our omelets with a side of potatoes arrive and it is something I can eat, but not good. Then we wait forever to get our check and get out of there.   I can forgive bad food and I can forgive bad service, but not a combination of the two. We won't be back to see if the third time is a charm."}
{"text":"First off. The food was terrific. However, slow service during happy hour on a Sunday afternoon was not appreciated.  35 minutes for three happy hour apps?? Revolving bartenders so we really didn't know who to ask for service. And we weren't the only ones. People kept moving around to better seats to get service.  Also the guest across from us had lipstick on there glass.  Even though it was happy hour. If u don't order what is on discount prepare to pay strip prices plus. (Over $100.00 for two).  Overall, a bit too pricey for apps and cocktails for me."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and great bar ambiance. All of the bartenders are great, except one tall thin guy seems to serves all the pretty woman before before guys, ie me.  Which I understand but i assure you a spend more money and tip better. Lesson learned.  To politely get his attention sometimes you have to modestly flag him down as he'll walk right past you with your empty glass stretched out in front of you. When you politely call for his attention he gives you the fisheye.  I only mention this because it seems to constantly happen with this guy. Shouldn't have to beg for a drink at these prices. Just sayin'. That aside love the place. Food is very pricy but excellent."}
{"text":"I had the Potatoes Au Gratin here. Very good! I also got to choose off a special menu and ordered tenderloin with foie gras.  I am a huge foie gras fan, but I didn't like mine too much. It was far too gooey that night. The steak was perfect but huge. I saved it and had it for lunch the next day and boy was it a treat!  The service was the best. They were very attentive and nice. Surprising did not take very long to get my entree. The ambiance was very dark but cozy."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious and delicious! Outstanding service and extremely knowledgeable sommelier. I had a petite filet in a truffle sauce with seared foie gras. OUT OF THIS WORLD! The sides are big enough to share..we definitely over ordered. Try the mac n chz!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, fantastic food, wonderful atmosphere.  This is my go-to place for the special, special occasions.  Especially those involving my lovely wife.  The steaks are wonderful, I recommend the peppercorn sauce.  Ask for the creamed corn (not on the menu) and prepare to be blown away.  The wine list is great and reasonable, and the martini's are world class (I like \"Hank's Dirty\" with blue cheese stuffed olives).  If you want a beautiful night with a significant someone, you probably cannot go wrong with this Vegas classic (in Green Valley, Henderson)"}
{"text":"Day 3 of eating out with a friend whos wife is out of town. It seems each night the check has doubled in price. First nights tab was about $50, $100 and tonight was over $200 with tip. Good thing this is not a recurring thing but I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great steak dinner. The place is nicely decorated in white stone(marble?) and a brown wood or plastic with an interesting pattern with plenty of expensive crystal chandeliers. For a upscale steakhouse its funny to see the dress code listed as \"Resort Casual\" as my friend got away with wearing shorts. This place was named after Brian Greenspun's father who older locals(20+ years) remember as the owner of the LV Sun, Prime cable and is the land developer of \"Green Valley\" and \"Alliante\" communities. This place serves up many steakhouse classics. I started with a brilliant Heirloom tomato salad w/buffalo mozzarella with a aged balsamic vinaigrette. I had the huge dry aged bone in Ribeye cooked perfectly included were plenty of side sauces. On to the sides, as others have said \"WOW\" they are large servings. We tried the creamed corn and Au Gratin potatoes which were recommended as the house specialties and as the final gut buster the Mac and Cheese. They were all very flavorful compared to some other places. My friend actually told the waiter that they should spiff up their Mac and Cheese by adding the panko bread crumbs like the corn LOL although he could be right. At the end somehow dessert was ordered and we received the Molten Lava cake and Bananas Fosters. They were OK but less spectacular than the rest of the meal and service. Lots of leftover sides to take home. This place adds to why GVR is my favorite Station casino."}
{"text":"This is the best steak house that I have eaten in in Vegas and maybe anywhere in the world. The 11oz filet mignonette was awesome as was the Shiraz. The service was flawless and was every bit as good as the food."}
{"text":"Fitst of all I want to say I came here with very high hopes because I am a steak lover. Sadly this restaurant was an epic disappointment!  Here's the thing I don't mind paying good money for a good meal but a side of macaroni should never out do a bone in ribeye! I mean the price you pay at this place is absolutely ridiculous for the steak you get. How can you have steak in your name and not be even decent at cooking the dang thing. Wait staff is friendly but overbearing and a bit pompous at times but I mean it's a classy place. I would really try something like golden steer much better food and really quiet atmosphere along with some neat stories hanks on the other hand gets a big \"sucks\" sticker."}
{"text":"VERY expensive but also VERY GOOD.  Get the prime rib and lobster for two.  It will run you about $150 but it is well worth it!  Great choice for that \"special\" evening!"}
{"text":"Best place around for martini happy hour. Classy place. My favorite is the Lemon Drop Martini. You will love the ahi mini tacos. All their appetizers are top notch. No bar food here. It's also a good place to meet interesting people."}
{"text":"Elliquette restaurant, attentive wait staff. Mash potatoes were probably the best I've ever had - coming from a girl that loves her taters. My filet mignon was okay, not the best, sent it back after our server requested and noticed I wasn't eating it. Was disappointed a little, plus it was $400 for a table of 4 and two people even split their steak and we only had two glasses of wine. Oh well lesson :/ again :/"}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour yesterday and noticed they had two new bartenders ( at least they were new to us, we go there often). Service was very slow and the drinks were just not the same. Too bad......one of our favorite hangouts... Let's hope it was just an off day."}
{"text":"I thought the service was amazing but the prices were outrageous. Our bill for two of us came to $465. The waiter suggested the Stone crab appetizer which we agreed to. I never like to talk money when we go to high end steak houses so I did not ask how much they cost. Four claws for $100. That's ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is an easy 5 stars. Amazing decor and atmosphere. Great selection and perfectly done steaks. My favorite is the rib eye bone in."}
{"text":"It didn't take us long to return for happy hour again AND dinner.  With another couple we came back for a drink pre-dinner.  I had the key lime martini and pretzel bread once again.  At dinner, we had a great waiter Claudio.  Eric R. and I decided to share a steak.  We started off with the hearts of palm salad (hearts of palm, avocado, tomato, micro greens, pear vinaigrette) and our friends shared beef carpaccio with us.  For the meal, we split the 24 oz bone in ribeye (with plenty of leftovers!!), creamed corn (mmmm) and the foie gras, but instead of just foie gras by itself, it came with berries, fresh figs, and balsamic glaze.  Even Eric R. who first announced at Vegas Uncorked 2 years ago, \"WHAT'S FOY GRASS?!\" enjoyed the foie and all of the berries with it!  We were all too full for dessert, but the food was tasty, the service great, and the ambience very nice.  We were under a stunning chandelier.  Claudio even joked with us when he asked what type of water we wanted, Eric R. and I both exclaimed, \"LAKE MEAD!\" and Claudio told us, \"It isn't Lake Mead...at Hank's we serve Chateau Lake Mead water!\"  A steakhouse meal cannot be a regular occasion for us, but this was a nice treat and we will definitely be back for more happy hour martinis!!!"}
{"text":"Hank's definitely stays on my list of places that wow me. Great atmosphere from the bar area with live music, to the great booth in the dining room with all the hustle and bustle of the staff creating that fine dining experience.  We felt very comfortable and well taken care of. Even had the manager share a bottle of wine with us! A memorable evening."}
{"text":"I hesitated going here based on reviews and I should have just trusted the reviews, but I had a $25 coupon, so why not? Anyone who says this place has \"flavorful\" steaks, has never eaten a decent steak. I was seated right away and service was ok. I waited for at least half an hour until the bread came out. The bacon cheese roll was probably the highlight of the meal, sadly. I ordered my steak medium, emphasizing that I like a warm pink, not red. Well it came out like a hockey puck! Searing doesn't mean suck out every last bit of moisture from the steak. This steak was so dry, no pink and zero flavor. Not even salt or pepper. I had ordered it with a bearnaise which barely saved it. I just couldn't get over how tasteless this steak was. For the money being charged, it should be cooked to perfection! Sonoma or Craftsteak has better steaks than this place. I also ordered the pee wee potatoes seeing they were cooked in duck bacon fat.....not sure how, but these were also tasteless. I've had duck fat potatoes to die for and these were not them! I agree with the reviewer who said the toffee cake was just too sweet after a few bites. I will definitely not be returning or wasting money here again. Oh and on a side note, I could not get over the amount of noisy kids in this place! I felt sorry for a couple who were all dressed up, probably celebrating something. You think a restaurant like this could separate out areas for people with children. I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a meal and hear rugrats screaming."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour in Sunday.  Environment: the classy restaurant has a nice dimly lit lounge area where you can enjoy their happy hour from 4-7 every night. They have live performances with talented singers, and even have a table that is directly connected to the piano sometimes used. The restaurant is pretty high class, so most people are dressed in resort attire although I don't think it is mandatory.  Service: the Bartenders were really nice and gave some suggestions that really made my cocktail and experience enjoyable. The food also came out quickly.  Drinks: I only have been here for happy hour. I'm sure their main menu is much more expensive but the happy hour is a really good deal with cheaper shareable foods and a wide range of different martinis. My favorite martini is he cucumber which was great with gin and I also really like the blackberry. There are so many options, but most taste good. The tuna tacos were also amazing, it was small but Hsu the perfect bite of fresh tuna, some veggies and a little heat. The sliders were also really delicious, they were warm, the meat was thinly sliced and melts in your mouth with a little mayo sauce inside.  Overall, great experience. Probably a little expensive, but a nice spot to take a date or a friend and try a bunch of different martinis and appetizers."}
{"text":"Over priced ala carte menu.  Bad service.  20 minutes to get a drink, $10 \"happy hour\" price.  We left because no body seemed to want to take our food order.  Check came without a pen to sign with.  Just a plain crappy experience.  I've had better service at 'Pissed off Pete's' in San Francisco."}
{"text":"The steak I ordered was cooked perfect and the flavor was great. However, for the price of the food the service was poor. Also, I ordered Pellegrino water and they brought me regular water.  Additionally, I ordered a sweet potato and they brought me a regular potato. Finally, the asparagus were large, undercooked and the flavor was poor. I sent back the asparagus. Overall I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty great!!! It's extremely classy..a little too much for me..hahaa. However, the staff is super sweet and talking to them was so fun! The steaks cut like butter and the potatoes and salad taste divine!"}
{"text":"I have been to about 80% of the fine dining steakhouses in Las Vegas. This is probably my new favorite steakhouse. The ambiance is top notch and the customer service was outstanding (as it should be for fine dining). My steakhouse salad, filet mignon, and sides were 5 Stars. You must try this out and compare. And I will admit, it is steep competition in Las Vegas where it is the small things that sets steakhouses apart."}
{"text":"Simply great steaks. The asparagus is outstanding and I am not a big fan of asparagus.  We go for a celebration dinner, maybe 2x per year. Always a good time"}
{"text":"Have eaten there a dozen times and never had a bad meal.  Recommend that you sit further back from bar area for more quiet on weekends."}
{"text":"My casino host at Green Valley Ranch resort made dinner reservations, but on entering I asked the hostess if we could split the comp between the lounge and dining room in order to take advantage of happy hour half pricing on martinis. The hostess said yes and so advised the bartender.   On the first round of drinks in the bar my wife went with an Elvis Presley martini (Stoli raspberry and vanilla vodkas, light Creme de Cacao, and fresh strawberries) while I chose the blackberry martini (Tangueray gin, St. Germain elderflower liquer, Funkin Blackberry, basil syrup and fresh lemon juice). So Good!   For round 2, you knew there would be a round 2, she got a bit tipsy on a Bo-Pino (Absolut raspberry vodka, Chambord liquer, Cointreau, and fresh lemon juice) and I may have got giddy on a Ginger martini (Absolut pear vodka, Stirrings ginger liquer, St. Germain liquer, pineapple juice, lemon twist and raspberries). Both were excellent.    We then made our way to the elegant dining room where we were presented with menus and a bread basket with soft herb butter. We shared a California salad with each of us ordering the petite 8 ounce filets that wee nicely charred while remaining medium rare as requested. These were tender and flavorful, and among the best we have experienced. For sides we chose grilled asparagus that still had a nice snap to them plus a baked potato. Service throughout was excellent."}
{"text":"For a steak house inside green valley ranch hotel  I thought this was a great outing for girls night We sat at the bar and only had drinks They know I dislike steakhouses  But I had some great wine Good local clientele prices were reasonable  The atmosphere was alive and kicking.  If you are a steak lover you will like it here.  I didn't try the food but the service was great  And then we retreated to Drop Bar"}
{"text":"Hostesses were standoffish and almost to the point of being rude. On Xmas day we had reservations and were told to wait at the bar but they didn't bother to come get us. All the food we ordered with the exception of the Caesar salad was not what we were expecting from a 4 star place, how does one ruin Alaskan King Crab legs, Macaroni and Cheese and potatoes Au gratin. The drinks were average but at $10 a pop, come on people. Total bill $200+, will not return."}
{"text":"I have eaten here in the dining room multiple times and I am consistently impressed. Pino at the bar will hook you up with a professionally mixed cocktail while you wait for your table. He has memorized my name and calls me by it when he sees me. It's the little things that keep me going back.   Last night I enjoyed the 10oz Wagyu filet with charred corn and a baked potato. My dining partner ordered the regular 10oz filet. We compared the two and mine was so much more tender and flavorful! But it cost $86 (compared to $49) so you will pay a premium for the quality.   The charred corn was fresh and lovely and the baked potato was a baked potato. The real bacon bits made it feel more special.   The service is always elevated here and I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"We have visited the restaurant a few times. The first time I could not stop raving about the food and the impeccable service. I even went so far as to say it was the best restaurant I had been in. Unfortunately my next experience was disappointing. We started with the Caesar salad which did not taste fresh...the lettuce somewhat wilted. I was deciding between the filet which is what I usually have ...but went with the scallops. My scallops were overcooked and dried out. They also had a somewhat fishy taste which did not help. I am still upset over the fact that I should have  returned the dish. Sadly we will not be returning."}
{"text":"12/29/11 DINNER.  The food was great, BUT EXPENSIVE. (But we knew that, going in.)  The service was great. (In fact, the waitress was very sweet and attentive. I feel sorry for her, having to work there. The tips must be good.)  BUT the \"corporate\" leaders AND their policies are ... well ... SCREWED.  We went to GVR to attend an event coordinated by an outside entity (\"Rock N Roll Wine\", http://rocknrollwine.com/thursdays.html), which had advertised in their flyer online \"...in addition to the great wine and live music, GVR is offering 15% off dinner to anyone with a Rock 'n Roll Wine wristband in any of their restaurants.\"  So after the event (6p-8p) we decided to take advantage of said offer at Hank's, in the lounge. To make sure they would honor the 15%, we spoke with the \"suit\" at Hank's.  He told us that the event coordinator did NOT have the approval of Stations Casinos (the parent company) to offer that discount.  So we were screwed.  Wouldn't they just honor it, since we were eating a small ticket after all? It wasn't gonna KILL their receipts of the evening. (Keep reading for details.)  Answer: NO.  But the icing on the cake?  I got home to find that my bill at Hank's was taxed 18.1%, not 8.1%.  Don't tell me I was charged a 10% RESORT FEE to dine at what is, basically, a LOCALS hotel/casino?  What is WRONG with these corporate hacks? Do they WANT to drive business away? In THIS economy?  We've been to Hank's a number of times in 2011, during happy hours as well as regular business hours, spending lots in the restaurant and bar.  And we're done.   I'll never return to ANY Stations Casino ANYTHING, after tonight. Who needs this?    12/30/11 ADDENDUM.  We went back to the restaurant this evening to get an explanation as to why I was taxed 18.1%, not 8.1%.   They stated it was not a RESORT FEE, it was the ENTERTAINMENT FEE.   HUH?   I had been to this restaurant MANY TIMES over the past year I've lived here. I've sat in that same bar, I've eaten while their guitarist (it's been the SAME GUY, the entire year) played, and we were NEVER charged a 10% ENTERTAINMENT FEE.  Well, obviously \"We Luv Locals\" no longer.  I'll reiterate. The ENTIRE Stations Casino chain, with which we've done lots of business over the past year of living here, has lost ALL of our future business. We will no longer visit GVR, Sunset Station, Fiesta Henderson, Boulder Station, ANY of them. No more dinners at the Broiler, Cabo, Pasta Cucina, Terra Verde, Grand Cafe, buffets, especially HANK'S, EVER AGAIN.  And ALL THIS over the princely sum of 15% off $115 = $17.25 + rebating the 10% ENTERTAINMENT FEE of $11.50.  We sure hope Stations got their $28.75 worth from this idiotic move, to not have any more business from us, ever again."}
{"text":"Only have been here a few times for drinks and small bites but never have been disappointed with either. The fact that they do so well with these two aspects makes me want to return for more. Obviously you looks like a great place for dining but surprisingly also enjoyable for a happy hour or killing time."}
{"text":"We have gone to Hanks for several special occasions, in the past. This time was different. Upon our arrival, 8 minutes early, we were asked to come back at 7 and our table would be ready for us. Normally the hostess will suggest you wait in the bar and even carry your drinks when your table is ready. Not this time, she was very rude. We walked around the casino and my husband suggested that we go to the Mexican restaurant instead! We didn't because I had my heart set on Hanks for my birthday dinner.  Once we got to our table, we waited 10 minutes before our server showed up. (They're gonna teach us) no menus, water, notta. Once we got our dinner it was great as usual, but the initial experience really turned us off. Maybe the hostess should be taught that we are spending $500+ and she should be happy to see us, not rude."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in Henderson and maybe even the strip. Nicely decorated inside with a cool lit up bar. Before getting seated get a spot at the bar and enjoy one of their crafted martinis. The dining room and booth areas are decorated nicely. When it came to dinner we ordered the massive 45oz bone-in ribeye carved table side. Garnished with tons of different vegetables and roasted potatoes. I made the mistake of ordering some sides but to tell you the truth there was plenty that came with. The service was fantastic and always on top of their game. Great time here, cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"The service, food, drinks, were fantastic.  Took a chance on this place, and so glad I did.  A great find in Nevada!! Didn't have an issue with anything.  Worth it to check out, when you are in Las Vegas or in the area."}
{"text":"Hanks is one of my favorites. The food is excellent and the service is amazing. They really take care of you. Ask for Rick to serve you. He is the best."}
{"text":"I have been a Hanks patron for the past 5 years.  Usually very happy with food and service.  I have dined here with both family, out of town guests and work.  Today I would like to give them a 5 Star for food and a 1 Star for service. Went today for a special Mother's Day brunch and had reserved a table days in advance.  We showed up early for our reservation and checked in - letting them know we were ok waiting.  They told us they could check us right in without trouble.  Excitedly we followed the hostess as she led us past tons of empty tables to the very back room.    The back room is dark, you can see the dirty plates area and have no view of the lovey fire wall or chandeliers.  I politely asked if we could get a seat up front - the lady continued walking and told me that those tables were all reserved.  She left us hovering by a small table in the back obviously unhappy.    As she pulled out a seat an orange juice spilt all over the table and one of the chairs.  She said someone would take care of it and walked away.  A buss boy came by finally and took the soaked chair away leaving us one chair short for our 4 group party.  We had to beg for another chair and a dry table cloth.  My husband went to the manager and asked for another table and they finally moved us to the main dinning hall.  They never apologized.  The whole time we ate and when we left at least half the tables in the two main dining rooms remained empty.  That being said the food was fabulous as always.  The martinis, heart of palm salad, and scallops were amazing!!!!  We will give Hanks another try- maybe :("}
{"text":"Was at district with my friend tried to go to Bella Vita but they close at 9... decided to go to Hanks instead... it was wonderful! Service was great food was delicious..."}
{"text":"There's nothing like a great steak, and there's plenty of them in Las Vegas, that's for sure.  But there are certain places that are able to differentiate themselves from the herd of great steakhouses.  Hank's is one of those places.  Hank's combines a modern, yet comfortable atmosphere with top-notch steaks, seafood, and drinks.    Arriving at your table in Hank's, the first thing you notice is the large \"fish-tank fireplace\".  Separating two of the rooms at Hank's is a large tank with glass panels on both sides containing a large fireplace.  This is a great touch on the ambience, and is a very good backdrop instead of just a wall or a picture.    I can't comment on the other steaks, but my mom and I both got the 24 oz. Bone-in Ribeye.  This was Nebraska Corn-Fed, Prime, 28-day Aged Ribeye.  Does it get any better?  Oh wait, it does.  We had a 2002 BV Georges de Latour and 2006 Del Dotto Vineyard 887, Missouri U-Stave Cabernet Sauvignon to go with the steak.  While some people say that all of the expensive steakhouses are the same, because all of them are getting the best quality beef.  And I would agree, with the exception of places like Hank's.   The thing that differentiates Hank's from most other steakhouses is the char they are able to get on the steak.  Ya, I always hear about how every steakhouse has the 1200 degree oven, but not all of them are able to get the char that Hank's does on their steaks.  The steaks came out perfect medium rare, and were also perfectly seasoned.  If there's one thing that any chef appreciates, it's when all the food is well seasoned.  You would be surprised how often even fine dining restaurants under season their food. Not only did they do their steaks great, but everything on our table was perfect.  My Dad got the 12 oz. Tristan Island (South Africa) Lobster Tail.  The Lobster was very large, slightly sweet, perfectly/ simply seasoned, and very tender.  They also had a very large 20 oz. Lobster Tail, which would probably feed literally 4 people as an entree.   Our desserts were pretty standard, but very good.  We got the Chocolate Molten Cake and the Sorbets.  Very tasty, but very typical.  If there is one thing they can work on it's the desserts, but it was good enough to keep them at five stars.    The corkage fee at Hank's was steep, but very typical for Las Vegas.  For wine lovers, Las Vegas is a sort of hell due to the extremely high corkage fees, and the large amount of restaurants that don't let you bring in any wine.  Hank's is a $35 corkage fee, with a two 750 ml bottle limit.  This is pretty much standard for Las Vegas.   The Sommelier was a very nice guy.  The opening and pouring process was very quick, detailed, and professional.  He noticed the Del Dotto bottle, and we had a short conversation about our mutual love for visiting Del Dotto's winery, and the personality of Dave Del Dotto.  Many Sommelier experiences are snooty and awkward, but their Sommelier was able to talk about bottles that we brought in, and did so in a very educated, yet professional manner.   Overall, all of the people at my table while dining here said it was on par with the best steakhouses they have been to, being compared to Gene & Georgetti's and The Chop House in Chicago.  If you are in Las Vegas, and you are able to make it off the strip, check out Hank's, it's a special steak and a special meal."}
{"text":"This spot is located in Green Valley casino. I like the decoration, atmosphere with the live music & the foods were tasty with a reasonable price. We came here for happy hour & pretty filled up belly so we just got snack with a couple drink & gamble. The martini was so good & they have big menu for food & drink as well"}
{"text":"Ok, I know this is a steakhouse and I did order a steak. However, this review is for their fried chicken.  Holy chicken! (Can't use cow for this)  This has to be the best fried chicken EVER!  It is thick, juicy and just oh my!  This is definitely a Black Label chicken because it was so big. You get half a chicken and other sides I just can't remember because all I can think about is how I can get more.  Its $31, but after eating it you will know its worth it!  My Grass-Fed Filet was great and I enjoyed it but I wish I would have ordered the Fried Chicken."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Great vibe.   Sit at the piano and enjoy a great martini and steak.  One of the best in Vegas / Henderson."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! This steakhouse deserves all four diamonds and more. The food, drinks and service are far beyond anything else I have experienced. The steaks should never be ordered beyond medium rare or you will ruin them. The gazpacho with crab meat was great with a nice kick to it. I had a swordfish steak that was more fantastic than any piece of fish I've ever had. The chocolate croissant bread pudding blew my mind, seriously, drop dead delicious. I wish I could have a whole dinner of it! Hank's is number 1!"}
{"text":"Want to have an amazing steak dinner??? Then, you must go to Hanks!!!  Love an amazing martini??  Then, you must go to Hanks!!!  To start, the martini's from the bar are outstanding and they offer one of the best Happy Hour's for martini's I've ever found.  You can go to Hanks just to enjoy a martini or three and an appetizer during Happy Hour or start at the bar and move on to your dinner reservation.  You can also eat a full meal in the bar area and they have cute little tables that are a mere step down from the main dining areas.  Perk to this is that you are right by the piano and a get great entertainment.  Happy Hour martini's are 1/2 priced and a steal!  They also have one for just about every taste.  My personal favorites are the Bo Pino, the Pomegranite, and the Ruby Red.  Happy Hour lasts from 5-7pm every day (even weekends) and I believe they also have a reverse happy hour late some nights.  Another perk to this wonderful establishment is the live music.  Most nights, they have a live pianist who sings songs that just give you that feel good frame of mind.  He plays the guitar as well and adds to the ambiance of an already beautiful restaurant.  Since I mentioned beauty, I will say, this is as classy a steakhouse as I have ever seen.  Gorgeious chandeliers in the bar and dining areas, beautifully set tables with fine china, a very large wine display, and the large glass-enclosed fire just wow!  When you are seated, the staff actually pull your table out for you so you can walk right into your seat, no awkward sliding into your seat.  Also, you can't skip a trip to the restroom with floor to ceiling doors covered in a marble type tile and a sink that just screams elegance.  All that and I haven't even touched on the food!  OHHH the food!  It is, by far, my most favorite place to eat and celebrate the joys of life.  My husband and I typically get the 24 oz. Chateaubriand for two, which is a 24 ounce filet sliced at your table into tender slices.  We have never had a problem with getting it cooked 100% to our liking, medium rare, which is surprising because it's a very large steak and the edges never come out charred or more than medium with a perfectly cooked medium rare center.  We often top it with a Béarnaise sauce that melts in your mouth with goodness.  A little known fact about the Chateubriand is that it comes with a large assorment of cooked vegetables.  So the $100 price of the meal appears steap at first, but it more than feeds two and you get the vegetables you would probably add as a $10 side anyways.  We typically start with side salads and add the side of mac and cheese and consider it one of the best we've ever had.  Our favorite salads are the wedge (which is large and shareable) and the California chopped which comes with a fruit flavored dressing and chopped nuts.  You also start your meal with complimentary breads, a nice variety, including a delish cinnamon raisin, and smooth whipped buttter.  Considering everything, if you have never eaten here and love a good steakhouse, you should try Hanks.  You will not be dissappointed."}
{"text":"Happy hour for the mature crowd.  While the food is fantastic, drinks around 6pm are a regular draw. The 'closed' bar makes it feel more personal without being 'clubby'.  Top of my list."}
{"text":"NICE TRY BUT NO... When you order an $80 Wagyu filet medium-rare you should get an amazing cut of high quality meat, perfectly cut. Mine came out dry and a hard medium. Actually had to spit out some that was dry and unchewable. SO disappointed.   Beyond that why do they let losers walk in with gym shorts and t-shirts? Seriously? This isn't Arby's. There were three tables near me with people who had zero sense of class. Dress code might make the rest of us who actually know how to dress in public for so-called find dinging feel a little better about coming here and spending a significant amount for dinner.   I started with a stone sour martini which was fine. French onion soup was good but the presentation was sloppy with soup spilled all over the dish under the bowl. The Dish was white so that really looked ugly. Maybe switch to brown plates or focus on neater presentation.  Wedge salad after that was excellent.   Two glasses of Malbec wine with dinner. Wine good.  Sides of cauliflower with horseradish cream sauce had potential. Needed more sauce and it needs to be on the side or drizzled over the top instead of on the bottom of the dish.  The potatoes au gratin were forgettable as were the mushrooms which were bland and flavorless. I was offered a choice of sauces for the steak several minutes after my food arrived. That should have been handled upon receiving the initial dinner order. The red wine reduction sauce was good when it did come about ten minutes after my meal arrived. Service flow was a bit disorganized. Not sure if it was the servers first day or what.  Anyway, total fail. Overcooked meat and classless people really ruined it for me. Couldn't get out of there fast enough. $200 for just me and I felt like I was at a high priced Outback."}
{"text":"Went to Hank's on a Wednesday night. It was nearing the end of happy hour, so I was lucky to find a seat at the bar.  Although steak is my favorite food, I was after one thing:  fried chicken.  I have heard great things about the chicken at Hank's, so I had to see for myself.  I wanted a beer with my chicken, and I have to say, the beer selection was nothing to write home about.  I was expecting more.  Luckily they had Arrogant Bastard, and the bartender offered to keep the remainder of the large bottle in the fridge while I drank the first half.  I really appreciated that gesture.  In addition to the fried chicken, I had the mac and cheese, but I only ate about a third of it.  It's excellent, but RICH.  Large noodles with a very good crust on top.  The cheese flavor was very strong, I couldn't place all of them, but it's a great combination.  And, the cheese stretched out as you spooned it out, it was extremely cheesy.  I will get this again.  The fried chicken was SO close to being perfect.  First of all, it's white meat, so you would expect it to lose something in the way of juiciness.  This didn't happen, it was never close to dry, which is impressive.  The chicken was crispy, and there was plenty of flavorful sage gravy.  But, it needed salt and pepper.  If the chicken and gravy were seasoned the dish would have been fantastic.  That being said, it was very good.  It's not cheap at $31, but it was a very good representation of fried chicken, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Top notch quality all the way.  Great decor and service as well.  As usual, I opted for the ribeye.  Came to me nicely charred and cooked a perfect medium rare as requested.  Ordered a side of gorgonzola mashed potatoes.  Nice and buttery with the right consistency (mashed but with some texture).  Didn't have room for dessert.  Sorry for the sparse review but that's all I really have to say about it.  It's good.    Only quibble might be they could put a more complex seasoning on the steak.  Steaks can get boring to eat after a while though I did love this one the whole way through."}
{"text":"Hank's used to be our go-to place. We moved away for awhile so for our anniversary we thought we would go back to Hank's for old times sake. Super excited. But what a let down. It took forever to get our cocktails, our server pretty much ignored us the whole time, so we ended up asking his backers for things like the wine list and the check. And then the food was okay not spectacular, and it all seemed very over-priced for the level of service we received. I like paying for a nice meal, but I have had better service at restaurants half the cost. It's a nice restaurant, but I don't know if I will make it a regular spot again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a real treat. Fellas, if you want to impress your girl, take her here! It is away from the strip and situated inside Green Valley Ranch. It is beautifully furnished and decorated with crystal chandeliers in each room. This is top of the line luxury here. It is a bit pricey since sides are sold a la carte and two steak entrees can easily reach around $150. But if you want a fine steak and maybe want to celebrate a monumental moment in your life this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"On my quest to eat at as many Fine steak house so I got to Hanks fine steaks... first and foremost the company I was with made this a truest special meal. Thomas thanks for indulging with me. Thomas is not a foodie per se but I'm sure enjoys some good food and this place did not disappoint.  I want to give a shoutout to the service team that was assigned our table. I'm sure they are used to the stiff collard crowd, not the let's go spend some money on good food group. The were great and need to be commended. They even smiled and shook our hands as we left.  Now on to the food... I went a little avant-garde and ordered a burger and a beer. Not a large beer selection but I found a nice IPA that worked nicely. Then we come to the burger... USDA prime ribeye, with a blue cheese crust and French fries. I know, why not order a steak, well because the burger sounded awesome, and it was. This starts me out on a new quest, to find the best steak house burger out there.   The quest TBC..."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before, and had a great dining experience, my most recent one was subpar, and that's putting it nicely. First. I ordered a Caesar salad, it comes with almost zero dressing. I asked the waiter for an extra side, never came back.  I then asked the manager (or I assumed he was, as he was in a suit) and he quickly went to the kitchen to get the dressing for me.  So I get the side, put it onto my salad, just to find out it's horseradish sauce! I was so disgusted, I sent it back.  Then the entrees come out, and the waiter, as he is putting the plates on the table, knocks over a full glass of water, it went everywhere! The cherry on top was the steak temperature, I ordered medium, and it was rare in the middle.  They did refire it, but the waiter made it seem as it was correct, and shouldn't need one.  Needless to say, I will not be returning"}
{"text":"This place is seriously a cut above anything I've ever been too in my life and I'm even talking better than any place I've been to in Paris or Rome. The food is to die for! The service is something that is out of this world! I'll be going back when my anniversary comes up in January :) looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time for the great happy hour. 1/2 Price Martini's from 5-7pm.  If you come enough the drinks become stronger each time until finally 1-2 and you are set.  There is live music in the bar I think it's Tuesday-Saturday(?) The crowd is a mix of locals and tourists however beats the hell out of Drop across the room.  The restaurant is amazing, one of my favorite steakhouses in Las Vegas. A superb place to take someone special, worth the wallet emptying check, and you won't leave hungry.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"We were excited to eat at Hank's Fine Steaks & Martinis hoping for a good steak dinner.  The interior of the restaurant is sleek and sexy; we went on a weeknight and since the dinning area was not busy, we were seated right way and given menus and water.  But that's when our experience ended.  After sitting for 25 minutes without acknowledgement that someone would come by for our order, we gave up and left."}
{"text":"Creamed Corn is delicious.  I don't even like Creamed Corn but it was really good.  I mean, I ate all of the Creamed Corn. You should get the Gorgonzola Crust on your steak as well.  Really tasty calories are always good at a dinner like this.  They don't get everything right here.  Steak isn't as great as some other joints I've been in for the price.  But there is, the Creamed Corn."}
{"text":"This place is everything you'd expect from a fine steakhouse.  I was blown away.  Took my nephew and his girlfriend for an experience, \"that they will never forget.\"  That's what was said when we were done.  Absolutely top notch phenomenal!  \"Dressy\" for attire I marked on this rating, but we were casual and did just fine.  We didn't get thrown out.  MICHAEL is an outstanding server and the sommelier took care of our wine selection."}
{"text":"Went there again last night.  Was disappointed that they removed the Kale Salad and the Crab Cakes from the menu.  When I asked about it, the waiter said they were really popular items but management decided to remove them.  Huh? I think they need new management.  I still like the place for it's atmosphere and decor, the steaks are good too.  My only other complaint is the live music from the bar area needs to be turned down.  The people sitting next to us complained too but nothing was done.  Management are you listening to your customers????"}
{"text":"Delicious food, amazing service, and beautiful atmosphere. Enjoyed a steak that was cooked perfectly, the augratin potatoes were so yummy, the house salad was fresh."}
{"text":"I love eating at Hanks! It's a beautiful restaurant, great service and great food. Their macaroni and cheese is what dreams are made out of. Their steaks are juicy and flavorful. It's definitely worth the money to eat here if you get the opportunity."}
{"text":"I've officially become a regular here. Cheap martinis EVERY night (friday-saturday included!).. you had me at hello! Now that I've been here a dozen times, here's why this is my favorite spot in town for a drink (and sometimes dinner).  *Martinis are CONSISTENT and well crafted. Top shelf liquor, hot bartenders, fun combinations. I have yet to try one I didnt' love! At $5-$7 each during happy hour, they are very reasonably priced. Brassy Blonde is my personal favorite, but the pear one they haven't put on the menu yet is awesome as well.   *Atmosphere is great. Swank and upscale yet laid back and comfortable. I feel great in here wearing jeans and a hoodie or a little black dress. Comfortable large bar, low lighting, and huge plasma TVs. They also have great live music fairly often.  *Food is great! Steaks are awesome (even by Vegas standards). I have yet to have a bad dish here. Lately I've gotten into their succulent sliders. The meat patties are HUGE and juicy and cooked medium. They were covered in cheese and some diced onions. They were served on yummy fresh baked fluffy buns. Some of the best sliders I've had in my life honestly. No tiny smushed little patties here!!  At $10 for 3 they are hardly cheap, but considering their size, you could make a meal out of 3 of them for the average appetite..."}
{"text":"Filet Mignon....best I have ever had.  Service is impeccable.  I could eat here every single day....."}
{"text":"Have had dinner here once and spent happy hour here multiple times. Always very pleased, with the service and food. If you're going for dinner, realize that this is a nice steakhouse. It's not cheap. Take your time, soak in the ambiance, and enjoy your company. If you want fast and/or cheap, then a steakhouse was a poor choice by you. If you're going for happy hour, you need to know (and it's kind of surprising this needs to be said) that this is located in a casino. So if seats are reserved, that's because that person spends more money than you. Sorry, but that's how it goes. Become a VIP, and you can reserve a seat at the bar. Otherwise, you need to be patient. Don't give the bartenders grief about this - they do excellent work. If you can't be patient, you'd be further ahead walking 100 feet to Bottligia, where you'll probably get a seat at the bar, rather than grousing about how busy Hank's is. There are many times I arrive after 4:30 and the place is already packed. Not being a VIP, I deal with it or I move on.  Bar food is good during happy hour - tuna tacos always hit the spot, the lobster app is tasty. And the martinis are always done correctly."}
{"text":"I'm a big red meat eater.  I love a good steak, and I was here for a work dinner.  I took a look at the menu, and there were a ton of options that sounded phenomenal.  I got the lobster, corn chowder as my appetizer, and I wished I could have taken an entire pot of it home.  It was creamy and chock full of chunks of lobster, potatoes, bacon, and corn. Instead of a steak, I went just a bit outside the box and ordered the lamb chops.  Whoa!  For one, they serve you THREE good sized chops, cooked just the way you want them.  In terms of meat, I judge how good the dish is based on whether or not I feel like I need sauce to add flavor.  In this case, not a drop of sauce touched my plate.  The chops were thick, incredibly juicy, tender, and cooked a perfect medium.  We shared sides around the table, and my two favorites were the roasted brussel sprouts and the macaroni and cheese.  Both were very satisfying in terms of flavor.  For dessert, I went with the chocolate pistachio souflee and I was hooked.  It's all the chocolate you could want and topped with a not-too-sweet pistachio sauce.  I could have licked the dish it was so scrumptious.  Even if you are somewhere cheaper for dinner, go for dessert!  It's worth it."}
{"text":"Dinner at Hank' s was perfect. The atmosphere was elegant. The serving staff was attentive and helpful with suggestions when asked. The portions were generous and the quality excellent. We had both the lobster chowder and French onion which they split so we could share. The breads were delicious.  After having some of his rack of lamb I was too full for the chicken or cheese cake till this morning. Every thing was delicious and his birthday treat as an added delite."}
{"text":"Martinis, martinis, martinis!  Environment: The environment of the restaurant is very classy, with chandeliers, a large bar, and a grand piano decorating the front lounge area. Past the lounge is the restaurant area which is past a towering wall of wine bottles, which also exudes the same level of elegance seen in the lounge.  Food: I typically go here for the happy hour which is very generous for such an upscale restaurant. In addition to a couple food selections they have half off martinis, and the list is extensive. Between two of us we tried 6 martinis and each one was great, while there were still enough on the menu we had not tried which enticed to come again before we had even left. Standouts include the cantaloupe martini, the cucumber gin martini, and the apple martini. Each one tasted very fresh as opposed to tasting too sugary or syrupy.  Service: We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very nice and personable, offering us suggestions and making recommendations. Additionally, there was live music at the time and the singer even came by during her break to make conversation with us which really made the experience feel that much more intimate.  Overall I would come back to Hank's for the martinis and music, and I want to try coming for dinner as well!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour! Delicious martini's! Best ribeye I have EVER had. Defiantly a local fav! Must try!"}
{"text":"Great, lobster chowder and an amazing staff.   However the highlight of the evening hands down was Cali Tucker from The Voice Season 4 who preformed live! Better yet she took time while on break to do photos and speak with our table!!!   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the Canteloupe Martini! So fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food and very attentive service. Martinis are always awesome. Next time I may try to save room for one of their desserts."}
{"text":"This really is a fantastic place to dine & or enjoy a decadent cocktail. The ambience is fantastic and there's often great live music. The food is done well and kitchen observable which is always a plus for me as far as cleanliness and sanitation is concerned.   Chocolate expresso martinis are fantastic!  Ahi tacos, kale salad ,salmon etc."}
{"text":"Every time I dine here I have high expectations. Their prices are certainly comparable to high end steak houses on the strip. Actually they're the same as any 5 star non Michelin star rated restaurant on the premier LV strip. So....this being one reason we don't dine here on a very regular basis. If I wanted that I'd go to SW or StripSteak. I happen to love the charm & appeal of the nice local steakhouses.  If that's what you're looking for you might be disappointed. Upon entry..as usual, husband & I get a pre dinner drink at the bar. Tonight, sweet wonderful bartender! Great way to start our dinner! Short cute lil blonde bartender with the best smile! Thank you btw...you were the highlight of ANYONE we encountered!  Next we were seated promptly for our 6:45 reservation. Restaurant was not too busy, yet steady.  Waited a moment for our menus but nothing ridiculous ....at first. After taking PLENTY of time to select our bottle of wine & entrees (20 min) we continued to wait to order.  Not one mention of the specials. No mention of anything. You want an \"order taker\"...I sure had one. That's it. No help or assistance or asking if I needed assistance from anyone.  I didn't need it, but when one is there that long the gesture goes miles!  So...fiiiinally I order the wine. We order our dinner.  We are brought what we need, knife..fork. Our server does ask if we need more bernaise. The only quality check we were allowed apparently.  No one checks on us or asks if we are ok...until the chef does his dining rooms check, that was very nice. He literally went to every table and asked personally & made eye contact. But server, som...nope. Nothing. And I'm not kidding. No one other than chef.  So pros: Bar staff was fantastic as were martinis  Hostess staff was sweet & welcoming The food is great! We had the onion soup & Caesar to start. Very basic but yummy.  Waygu Filet & 11 oz filet Oscar style Brussels (special) Broccoli  Bottle of Nickel & Nickel Cabernet  Cons: Service is horrendous in main dining room."}
{"text":"Delicious, off-strip Vegas dining experience. Atmosphere is absolutely gorgeous, dinner items included everything from salads, decadent breads, seafood, perfectly cooked steaks, and amazing desserts. If was four of us that dined and all loved and thoroughly enjoyed our meals and experience.  A must try if you are a local or visitor willing to venture off the usual Vegas strip venues.  *Side note, we went on our Uber driver's recommendation after racing exotic cars earlier that day. Therefore, we weren't necessarily dressed for fine dining and felt a bit underdressed when we initially walked in. However, the staff kindly welcomed us, we had excellent service and conversation and never felt uncomfortable or out of place. We will absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Came here for a dinner on a Monday night because my Dad was staying at GVR, and a host offered him and his wife dinner at their high end steak restaurant for their last night in town. So a girlfriend and I joined them for dinner, and wine (lots of wine!) and we had a wonderful experience. First of all, the bread basket was awesome! We ordered the Seafood Tower for 4-6 people and honestly this was easily the best part of the meal. Shrimp, lobster, crab and oysters all juicy and ready to be eaten, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. It was truly amazing. I had a Filet Mignon and Creamed Spinach and both were great. And we literally had I think 5 bottles of wine lol. We actually said we would love to come back and just get the Seafood Tower, bread, and wine! The atmosphere was lovely with nice large booths and a long, beautiful fireplace in the center of the restaurant. This restaurant is on the pricier side but it's worth it for a special night out. The server also mentioned that they do a great happy hour and reverse happy hour in the bar area, so my friend and I plan to definitely check that out at some point. I'm looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"came here to have dinner with some other friends that happened to be in LV and am glad we came here.  It was probably the best meal we had in our 4 day NYE stay.  The meals are pricey but you get what you pay for.  Average food price was close to $100 per head without alcohol but we did let it flo so it was closer to $175 a head.  Would I come back?  Yes I think I would.  The Rib Eye and Scallops I had were some of the best quality I've had in awhile.  Worth the drive off the strip to Green Valley Ranch."}
{"text":"I am conflicted about my review of Hank's. To be fair, we only had drinks... drinks which ended up costing us the same as a very nice meal out. I get it. This place is supposed to be a bit swanky, and you are supposed to just pay $14 for your cucumber martini and just smile. Fine.   The good news is that drinks are half price at happy hour, and when you can get a bartender's attention they are decently friendly. Honestly, the people sitting around the bar trying to chat you up are even more friendly. Ladies, if you are looking for a rich, mid-50's man, this is your place. Sadly, I just wanted to catch up with my friend without the company of screaming children. Other good news is that the live music was very good. I thought they had a very good mixed cover CD on until I realized there was a super talented guy playing guitar live in the corner. You were really good, talented guitar guy!"}
{"text":"I have yet to have a bad meal here after going to dinner here over 15 times in last 2 years. The steaks, from filet to rib eye, are outstanding. The salmon and halibut are always cooked perfectly and are so delicious. The sides, from broccoli to tater tots to a whole yam to corn... Wow, one is better than the next, which was great to begin with!  The appetizers: my favorite are the salads, and all are really good, my current favorite being the tomato and caprese salad and the heart of palm salad.  The wine list is exceptional, as are the desserts. The ambience is business opulence, with business casual dress... the restaurant is very friendly and the service is elite.  It is really easy to get to from self parking at the casino.  I highly recommend this for anyone looking to dine at a top of the line restaurant."}
{"text":"Great spot for locals when you want an excellent dinner without dealing with The Strip! I hadn't been here in a long time but when a friend wanted to take me to a nice dinner for my birthday but when I told her I wasn't in the mood to deal with The Strip she suggested Hank's. I jumped all over it as it's really convenient access from where I live and quite frankly I really wanted to catch part of the Sharks playoff game. I got there first and went to the bar to wait for my friend. I was happy as a clam to see the Sharks game on. So I bellied on up to the bar. As I walked in I noticed a customer with a frosty Moscow Mule. I was all over it and it was as refreshing as it looked served proper in a copper mug. My friend soon joined and although we had dinner reservations we opted to eat at the bar so I could continue to watch the Sharks win. The awesome thing to note was that the service and attention we got was just as on par as if we had sat at a table. We indulged to say the least starting with a bottle of rosé and oysters and ending with amazing desert (Go for the toffee cake!) washed down with frangelico. Oh yeah... There was an amazing ribeye, salad, sides and Pinot Noir in between. Everyone from the bartenders to the manager made us feel like queens. And what's even better was there was live music as well. Once we finished our amazing meal (and finished watching the Sharks win) we went and sat at the bar that is custom made around the piano. Oh and there might have been another glass of rosé... Such a perfect night! Will definitely not wait so long to return!"}
{"text":"3.5** Not worth the price. Maybe better for meat eaters.   Came here for a work dinner and boy did I eat a lot. I started off with one of each types of bread because bread fresh bread with butter or olive oil is extremely addicting. My main dish was the Dover sole and this was the first time I had it. It was basically an entire fish and they debone it at the table. The fish was tender but there wasn't much flavor to it.   For my starter, I had the lobster chowder and big eye tuna poke. I liked the lobster chowder more. It was so creamy and chunky and you can't really go wrong with chowder and seafood. The tuna dish aced presentation but I've had better tuna. It was fun to eat though!   As for the side dishes, I had mushrooms, asparagus, large pieces of boiled or steamed broccoli, Mac n cheese, cream collard greens, and mash potatoes. None of the side dishes were particularly exciting or memorable.   Now for the sweets, I had the creme brulee and sampled the chocolate pistachio souffle, butter toffee cake, apple pie sundae and fried oreos with vanilla ice cream. The souffle was the most creative dessert and the chocolate was very rich. The creme brulee wasn't bad; I wish they had different flavors of creme brulee. The toffee cake was moist but got too sweet after the second bite. The apple pie sundae was fun to consume since it was warm mixed with cold from the ice cream but it was missing the nice flaky crust. The fried oreos, it's hard to go wrong with fried oreos with ice cream. Great food truck food.   Amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"Every December, my brother in law and his buddy put all the Station points they've accumulated over the year towards a dinner at Hank's. This year they invited me to join their feast, and I happily obliged. Even though the crowd and noise was almost overwhelming, the delicious seafood tower and flavorful steaks were highlights of the meal and couldn't be hidden.  Our party of five was seated promptly at the 7 PM reservation time to a clean, classy restaurant with a vibrant atmosphere. Our server Brandon greeted us and he and his team were on top of everything throughout the meal. To start, the table indulged in the Seafood Jumbo Jackpot consisting of Maine lobster, shrimp, oysters, colossal lump crab, Jonah claws, and king crab. Everything in the tower was absolutely delicious from the sweet crab claw to the plump shrimp. The oysters were from Washington (Cold Creek, I believe) and were snatched up so quick that I only got to taste one. And the amount of lump crab meat and king crab meat alone was enough to make the $75 price tag worth it. If you're into the chilled seafood thing, I would definitely recommend the tower.  This was my first opportunity to try the filet from 7x Beef in Colorado for my entree. This beef goes beyond the standards for American wagyu by being 100% from one breed of Japanese cattle instead of the minimum 25% Japanese to be classified as American Wagyu. Could I taste the difference? Yes, it was more tender, juicy, and flavorful than its Angus cousin. My brother in law and his buddy got the Kansas City Strip and 22 oz bone-in rib eye respectively, and they both devoured their steaks.  The sides were standard, with the nice selection of earthy mushrooms being my favorite. The warm butter cake, which the entire cake was eaten by me, was an excellent finish along with a snifter of Remy Martin. There was an unusually long wait after the first course. So long, that I was too hungry to pause and take a picture of my filet. Our three course meal took right around two and a half hours. Pricing was just under a $100/person, but this was expected as we all kind of splurged to start the Christmas week. I would put Hank's in the top tier of off the Strip steakhouses and would be happy to join my family each time for their yearly dinner."}
{"text":"Now if you are going to spend $100+ for a great steak dinner, this is your place!  I was overwhelmed & shocked with the amount of food that came with our Tomahawk Chop for 2 .  Part Filet, part Strip, this is an excellent choice for sharing. And because it's a large cut of meat if someone, like myself likes their steak a little more cooked, like Medium for instance-I grab the ends, and your co-diner likes his cooked less [M/R]- closer to the bone, this is perfection in a skillet!  The meal, see my pix, consisted of a very large portion of Steak, Asparagus, Carrots, Potatoes, Tomatoes, Onions, and Broccoli for $99! UM that's 6 sides and a steak for under $50/person and leftovers to boot!  I'm so sad I didn't find out about this sooner!  Best deal in town for a high-end steakhouse if you ask me. And they have live music, an extensive wine list, and great cocktail menu as well!  Hooray Great find!"}
{"text":"Located at Green Valley Ranch Resort, they have the best Martini Menu I've seen and they taste just as good as there creative names.  They don't skimp on the brands of Vodka either and 1/2 price from 5pm to 7pm- YUM!"}
{"text":"This is a great steakhouse. The service was great. The food was delicious. I tried their filet and it was absolutely perfect. I wasn't as hungry so I ordered the ahi poke. I loved it. I also highly recommend the truffle tater tots. SO YUMMY.  Service was good, only I will say it did take a fairly long time to get my meal. That won't affect my rating this time though because I wasn't in a hurry thus I wasn't bothered by it."}
{"text":"The food was good, certainly up to the reputation Hank's has, steaks were cooked perfectly, sides were generous in portion size, service was ok.  The main issue was the amount of time the meal took, I can understand not wanting to rush a good meal, but it took roughly 90 minutes from ordering to delivery of the food, way to slow IMHO."}
{"text":"Their steaks are amazing. The service is very attentive, but not annoying. It's a nice atmosphere (in spite of being in a casino).  I highly recommend their warm chocolate dessert (if you still have room)."}
{"text":"Had the bone in strip.  They state it's dry aged...and prime. It was not prime purely due to the lack of fat marble and I don't thing it was dry aged either.  Regardless it was tough and not seasoned well.  Corked correctly but not worth 50$. Not even close."}
{"text":"Let me just start off my saying everytime my girlfriend and I go out together we always get the worst service possible. We came to this restaurant hoping to find good service in a more local restaurant (we both live near GVR). But needless to say we won't be going back. We sat in the lounge area so we could have wine and an app, and when we sat we were greeted almost immediately by a bartender. We ordered wine and a lobster & clam chowder which were both served promptly. This is where it goes downhill. We didn't like the soup (too much bacon), and waited for our server/bartender to check on us so we could send it back for something else. 20 minutes went by (I'm a restaurant manager and timed him), and he never came by. My friend even waved at him from across the room, he looked at her and kept working behind the bar. My friend then asked the hostess to get the manager. Once the manager came over everything was rectified with our food, and she got a different bartender to serve us. She even comped our food (we ordered mac and cheese and she gave us cheesecake), and took the time to listen to our complaint. The other part that sucked was that you pay an automatic 10% entertainment fee for a crappy piano player. Is there a fine dining place for locals, or do we always have to go to the strip??"}
{"text":"This is one of the most beautiful restaurants I have eaten in so far, other than Mix.  Loved the walls upon walls of wine around, and that granite lit up bar was beautiful.  The chandeliers, all impressive.  The service is also really worth mentioning.  We were seated promptly, and we literally had three people assisting us, constantly making sure we were happy, cleaning the table, etc.  The only weird part was that they had the table all set when we walked in, and the first thing they did was remove the plates!  Strange.  So we did not come here for happy hour and sit in the lounge, but we should have.  I thought the dinner was good but not worth the money we paid for it, which came out to about $225 including tax and tip.  For apps, husband ordered the french onion soup which had a great flavor but was ruined by the insane amount of salt in the broth.  He said had it not been for the sodium this would have been his favorite french onion soup, and he's had lots.  We still have not found a place in Vegas that makes better french onion soup than 13 Coins in Seattle. Not Bouchon, and not Mon Ami Gabi either.  If someone knows of good places, please let me know!  I ordered the Hank's house salad which was absolutely yummy.  It isn't a type of salad I normally get but it was like a BLT salad, chopped, with avocado.  Very memorable and delicious.  I have no idea what kind of dressing they put on it but it was slightly creamy.  For entrees husband had the bone-in New York strip, which was supposed to be dry aged.  He ordered it medium rare, but it came out very rare.  He thought it was very good but he was struggling with the insane amount of fat on the meat.  whole portions of the meat were so fatty it was almost inedible.  I ordered the petite fillet, medium rare, but it came out and I cut into it, it was cold.  It was as if they cooked my fillet before the New York and then let it sit for an hour or something.  I know I should have sent it back, but I ate it anyhow.  We had the truffled tater tots which I thought were too overpowering and I could only eat a few, as could my husband.  I also had some wild mushrooms that were pretty good and went well with my steak.  All in all an ok meal, definitely not worth what we paid.  We'll definitely be going back though,as they made the best martinis I've ever had, but we'll stick with the lounge and go for happy hour.  For the quality of drinks, what we paid for them was a total bargain."}
{"text":"I totally agree with the 5 star for ambience. The place is stunning. It is a bit of a challenge to find it, however.  Arrive in time for Happy Hour prices and enjoy the BEST martini!  We found the food average, and just incredibly over priced. $10 for a baked potato?  Seriously?  The steaks were average, nothing over the top.  The pork chop was undercooked and tough. Therefore, the food brought the rate down for us. Absolutely a 5 star for service.  Delightful, professional and attentive.  A special dessert delivered to the table when they heard we were celebrating a 40 year tradition of joint birthday and anniversary. Will we go back? Not worth getting there from Vegas for us."}
{"text":"Hanks has the best on the ice staff on menus and on management staff to make all feel very comfortable and enjoy a very delicious dinner including the most varied wine selections I really wouldn't recommend them"}
{"text":"I feel like I a cheating on my honey because I love Hank! The steak, the martinis, the man that sings up front. Be still my heart! Who is this Hank and how can I have him to myself.  Hank's Fine Steaks in located in Green Valley Ranch Casino in the middle of the hotel. I swear, once you walk in you forget your in a local casino and are transported to an upscale, ristsy martini bar. Chandeliers, fire places, mood lighting...I am getting goose bumps thinking about it  The ambiance is very upscale and calming. They staff is very attentive and focused on service. My favorite part....THEY PULL OUT THE TABLE...so you can easily get into the booths. Yes please! :)  The food has never let me down. I am in love the the beef carpaiccio and the house salad. We get these every time we come here. The creamed corn is a must try and the truffle tators were delicious. The steak, oh the steak...amazing! It is so huge that we share and still cannot finish our side. YUM.  BEST NEWS YET...if your local you can get a $25 for $50 coupon at weluvlocals.com. I mean, we usually never leave without paying over $150...but they love locals! LOL.  Finally, you must try their martinis. We had the german chocolate martini. It was so good I had three! Just saying. Plus....happy hour, half off martinis and appitizers from 5 to 7 every day! YEAH!  My next mission now is to find this Hank and proclaim my love for him, wait he might just be the guy that sings live there every night. That means Hank might have been serenading me this whole time...No wonder I love it there!"}
{"text":"Torn between 4 and 5. Service is def' a 5. Having DUCKHORN wine is a 5. Now the steak is a 4. The martini was a solid 5. As for the side dish, Creamed corn and brussel sprouts were my fav and a 5. Mac and cheese and steakhouse salad were 4.  Overall, a quality steakhouse. I used to frequent GVR but never came here till recently for a birthday dinner. I was pleasantly surprised.   Nice decor inside... Food was great but it wasn't the best I've ever had. Maybe I am a bit spoiled when it comes to fine dining.   Would I go back? Yes. Do I recommend? Yes.    ENJOY~ all you carnivores!"}
{"text":"This is an update for the bar area.  Went on a friday to listen to live music.  The singer was very good and played both acoustic guitar and piano.  However, the service was horrible and the crowd worse.  I tried a couple of their special martinis which were ok butt there really aren't many daring mixes.  The guy next to me at the bar spent 10 minutes complaining that his 24 dollar burger came on a regular bun.  So i went and sat down at the piano bar.  There was one other couple at the piano bar at the same time.  I literally witnessed them order, get served, be asked several times if they needed anything and be served again during the 30 minutes I sat there with an empty water in front of me and an open tab just begging to have something charged to it.  When the singer took a break, I went back to the bar, closed out my tab.  The bar manager asked if everything was ok and I told him no one had asked if I wanted anything.  All he could do was stammer an apology but I was already on my way out.   Shame because I really like this place and remember when you couldn't even find a seat on a friday.    I will go back though because I like live music and maybe the rest will be better next time."}
{"text":"Our new fav when we come to Vegas! The service was awesome, the food was amazing and the ambience was great! We will definitely be here every time. Megan and Renee were both wonderful at the bar. They made our visit perfect! Thank you"}
{"text":"Went there couple of nights ago for a date night. We had the two wagyu steak they are offering. They were good, however, I wanted mine medium well cooked and ended up with it medium rare. I will admit that it was partially my husbands fault - both, him and the waitress insisted I would ruin the cut if it was cooked more and I went with the flow. I was sick the entire night from it - it was probably too heavy for my stomach. Así, the steak was too salty for me - I didn't understand the need to put that much salt on such a good cut. Maybe the meat was just a little too old.  We also got three sides - grilled tomatoes (nothing impressive), potatoes au gratin (just ok), grilled asparagus (ok).   I feel like a $300 dinner for two should have been a better experience food wise. Service was great and also were the drinks (hence, the 3*). Would probably be back for drinks, definitely not for steak. Maybe for dessert too - we had the butter cake and it was good."}
{"text":"My new favorite steakhouse in the Vegas valley.    The service is top notch.  The decor is classy without being ostentatious. The staff were friendly and interested in making sure that the diners were taken care of.  The meal was super.  The selection of breads served before the meal were unusual and delicious.   I ordered the steakhouse salad which was one of the best I have experienced in a long time.   My filet was absolutely perfect.   It was cooked, seasoned and presented exactly as it should be.   We ordered side for the table and there were good sized and tasty.  The whole experience at Hanks was just damn good.   I have been here twice in a week and plan on going many more times in the future.  Hanks Rocks!"}
{"text":"What more can be said about Hanks Fine steaks! Delicious 5 star dining experience. The meal is properly coursed out with not that rush to the next guest feeling. We were offer individual attentive wait staff. It was present at each table this amazing service. I'm sure every guest felt like a VIP.  The steak was fine and cooked to perfection.  We look forward to dining at Hanks again soon."}
{"text":"Kind of drove around the Green Valley Resort for about five minutes because we thought this place was in the shopping complex next to it. 'Tis not, it is inside of the Green Valley Resort on the casino level.   Great decor on the inside. The wood and the fireplace in the middle kind of reminded me of a lodge type of feeling.   Service was awesome, drinks were always full, bread was kept stocked on the table, and knowledgeable staff. In fact, the waiter was really nice and didn't \"F\" us over when my buddy and I asked him to suggest us a red wine with our dinner choice. (He didn't automatically choose a high end expensive glass of wine, and the choice paired well)   The wife and I shared a rib eye (I believe 16oz), mashed potatoes, and creamed corn. Not exaggerating here, but every single bite of the steak was amazing. There is only one other place that my wife and I have ever gone to, that every single aspect of the food was a 5 out of 5. (The other is the Summit House in Fullerton, CA)   Of course, with this caliber of food comes the price. The food, two cups of coffee, and one glass of wine came out to be around $100.   Definitely would go back to this place, and recommend it to all friends who visit the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Top ten reasons you are doing your foodie loving self a disservice by not eating at Hanks when you are in Las Vegas:  1) BEST. DIRTY. MARTINI. EVER. . . EVER  2) The place suggests sex and intimacy- but not in a Las Vegas Hooker way.  It is beautiful, it is stunning, it is classy and it makes me wish I went with a significant other and canoodled in the booth in the back  3) The creamed corn is out of this world, I will salivate about it at random times throughout the day when I have a flashback about its awesomeness...and I usually hate creamed corn  4) The scallops are amazing.  Nothing more needs to be said  5) The hostess/host pulls the table out from the booth if you are seated at one.  Now that, my friends, makes me feel like less of an awkward fool trying to shuffle in and more like an elegant lady sitting down to a fine meal!  6) The filet mignon is the most succulent, juicy, flavorful piece of meat that I have had in a long, long time  7) The atmosphere is inviting.  So many times you go to a restaurant and you feel as if you are just another person waiting to eat before they shove you out the door.  Not at Hanks.  At Hanks they invite you to cozy on up to the fire (that has a fish tank in it) and stay awhile, maybe even put your feet up  8) The steamed Alaskan king crab legs are the biggest things I have ever seen.  They literally hang off the plate.  They are served ready to eat and the butter is heated in your very own flame heated mini bowl so you don't have to share...mmmmmmm  9) The service was impeccable.  They never lingered too long but they were always there when needed and added some great insight into the menu and the incredible wine selection  10) The chopped salad is something that I could eat every day, it is just that good!  A little side note: I was in Vegas with locals that have lived there for more then 25 years...they had two favorite places to eat, one was a sushi place by their house, the other Hanks, which they declared the best steakhouse in the city.  I would agree with them."}
{"text":"BEST MEAL EVER!  I was skeptical as to how good this place was going to be but was blown away by not only the food, but also the service.  Everyone was so pleasant and attentive.    It is a bit pricey, but no more than any other nice steakhouse.  My husband and I split the crab cakes (OMG) as an appetizer.  They were phenomenal!  For $19 we got two large crab cakes with a light frisée salad.  For our main course there was an option for a t-bone that was about 44oz and was perfect for two.  It was also one of the only meals that came with roasted veggies and potatoes.  The steak was split in to a fillet that melted in our mouths and also a strip steak.  They were cooked to perfection and our waiter did a great job slicing and dividing it up.  It was about $125 but most other steaks were between $40-$60 individually and $8-$12 for sides.    The atmosphere was beautiful and there was a guy playing acoustic guitar."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff however they were clearly under staffed and the timeliness and service suffered greatly. At one point 2 of our party guests made the comment that \"they must have forgotten about us.\" Our waiters hastily took our order and seldom asked us for additional drink orders. When they did the drinks took forever as did our food. Food was excellent. Would have given it a 5 if it wasn't for the lack and timeliness of service which is to be expected at this price point."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful upscale restaurant in Henderson. I highly recommend the happy hour that has wonderful appetizers at reasonable prices as well as half off martinis. The live music is also a bonus."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour because prices were so much better.  $42 got us a MY steak, a beef rib, and French onion soup.  Wonderfully seasoned delish."}
{"text":"We were there July 4th weekend, and the bar was packed. We found 2 seats near the back and near the musician. Service took a while and we were told the bar is backed up. We loved the food- prime rib sliders, shrimp cocktail and watermelon salad. We didn't love the \"entertainment tax\" that was ever so hidden in the bill within the sales tax. When we complained about it, our server said it was posted on the menu. But not the happy hour menu!  The manager removed that charge from our bills, and told us which nights didn't have live entertainment.  I can't recommend coming for happy hour when they have entertainment."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here.... Amazing happy hour, fantastic food, great live music. This was our second visit and we loved every minute. The deep fried Oreos are outrageous!"}
{"text":"We had a dinner meeting here 11-28. What a nice looking restaurant. We arrived earlier which wasn't a problem.    I read the reviews prior. I notice most complaints were about the food temperature.  They spend a lot of time transferring dishes from platters to this serving table. I watch them do it several times. My dish was just warm...   The food was okay. Maybe the price covers the experience?  If you need a good tootie kissing or you love a great brown nose, this is the place for you.  Our server disturb the table so much it became annoying.   Nothing stood out for me to rant and rave about. Another go is not out of the question...  5 stars/ ambiance/decor/wait"}
{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour at Hanks last nite!   The atmosphere is nice, the lighting is dim and provides a good ambiance and the restaurant is beautifully decorated. During our visit here there was a guitarist playing which made for great cocktail music.    We enjoyed dirty martinis and split an order of the steak fries... the fries are delicious! With a bed of French fries garnished with cheese, tomatoes, sour cream, green onions and of course STEAK, these were scrumptious and definitely worth a try!  The service was good, very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Still our favorite off-strip steakhouse! We went for a birthday dinner the other night and had an excellent dining experience. We stopped at the bar first for martinis since it was still happy hour (4-7 weekdays). Half off martinis was a great way to start dinner.   We ran a little past our reservation time but the hostesses said it was no problem and just let them know when we were ready. We were seated as soon as we were ready. Our wait staff consisted of Luis, Brandon and M. They all provided us friendly top notch service during our meal. We started with the lump crab cocktail which was served on ice with fresh lemon and the steakhouse salad, a classic with bacon and blue cheese.   We both the chose the filet which were cooked perfectly medium rare. Our sides of creamed corn and au gratin potatoes were also excellent.   Now for my one BIG complaint to the head chef. We ordered two toffee butter cakes only to be told THEY TOOK THEM OFF THE MENU! WHY WHY WHY? This was the #1 best selling dessert at Hanks and definitely our favorite. We were looking forward to it days before our dinner. None of the servers or Managers could explain the chefs decision. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!   Other than that we had a fantastic dinner with excellent food and service. Hanks has a great steakhouse atmosphere and we are really happy they are close to home. We will continue to frequent Hanks and keep hoping the butter cake returns!"}
{"text":"I love a great happy hour and Hanks makes a FINE martini! During happy hour martini a are half off. Hand crafted martinis made with fresh ingredients and there are plenty to choose from ranging from classic to new favorite flavors like cucumber. Cold and refreshing with just a hint of sweetness which makes it the perfect beverage to go with the chef inspired sliders. Tonight's slider offering: prime rib sliders on a potato bun with Brie and red onion relish #delish"}
