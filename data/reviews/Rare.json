{"text":"I have had great sandwiches and soup at Rare in the past so was excited to see they're offering a new line of grilled cheese sandwiches. I've had some tasty \"gourmet\" grilled cheese this past year and had high expectations for Rare. Well, my sandwich was tiny, flat and looked like it had been run over by a truck. Two thin slices of bread and a thin line of cheddar cheese. They didn't even bother to cut it in half. It looked worse than someone's throw-together school lunch. Big waste of money. I should have gone elsewhere in the food court!"}
{"text":"I like Rare because it's a break from the typical food court fare.  They still seem to be sorting things out as a month or so ago, they had some desserts including a apple/yogurt crisp which was delicious but is no longer available. Since then, they've also added a section in their counter for chop salads.

My Meal: 
1. Philly Style Sandwhich.  From a pure asthetics perspective, the meat isn't balanced throughout the sandwhich. But then I remember that this is the food court and my other options are the garden variety vendors.  The only real annoying thing about the sandwhich is that the juices start to soak through the bun so you're probably better off eating at the food court rather than going very far with it.

2. Mushroom soup - Wonderful Big chunks of mushrooms!  This is my favourite soup and I get it every time! My girlfriend thinks it's a bit salty but I love it.  It is allegedly a \"feature\" soup that is subject to change but I see it there often enough.

How much I paid - $10 and change. Not exactly cheap but decent value in the food court when comparing the freshness and the nutritional guilt of rare to other options.

Free tip - They don't cut your sandwhich but they'll do it upon request. Ask them to cut it to make the sandwhich easier to manage so that the insides aren't falling out.

Good for - Someone in a food court looking for a change from burgers and subs.

Will I go back? Absolutely. It's in my rotation of restaurants for lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered the roast beef sandwich off of the grilled cheese menu with the combo size mushroom soup.  Both were really tasty and I would go back there.  Much better than cold cut/deli style roast beef that they serve up at some places and the soup was really good, not too salty and not artificial tasting.

I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see a place with chopped salad. After having Chop't in New York, I was looking for something similar in Toronto and this was the closest I found. 

I ordered a Chicken Cobb salad for $10.18. The portion was pretty good but it wasn't very filling. The salad itself though was pretty abysmal. The lettuce and greens had no taste. The dressing was so watered down. In fact, my salad just tasted and looked very very wet. The only thing I could taste was the bacon bits. Now thinking back, was there even chicken in the salad? 

I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Glad I read the reviews because it seems like the only real good thing here is the roast beef.  I just ordered the Philly Style Roast Beef with a side of Chicken Vegetable soup and the reviews were right.  It was very good and not too salty.  I would eat here again but only the Roast Beef.  I try to eat what a place specializes in."}
{"text":"Had the express avocado and roasted chicken sandwich with a chili. At $10 on the dot, it's obviously not as cheap as cheap fast food goes, but I enjoyed the change from my usual hamburger and fries.

There's probably about two or three slices of avocado. It didn't seem like much, but it was okay. The sandwich as a whole was alright. Not particularly anything (juicy, fresh, delicious) but it was good. I like that you can load the chili with sour cream, chives, and cheese. I only wish it were bigger as it is a smallish bowl, but for the price, I guess that's pretty good. The chili was tasty, more flavourful than Wendy's and Tim Horton's, and sits in between Wendy's watery chili and Tim Horton's chunky chili.

If I feel like shelling out another $10 in the future, I wouldn't mind coming here again."}
{"text":"While checking out the Eaton Center's new Urban Eatery, my husband and I decided to try Rare for lunch.

Rare is one of the new spots there and they are all about sandwiches -  served with a soup or salad as a side.
Their signature sandwiches are topped with roast beef, however they have plenty of other options as well if you don't feel like eating cow.
(Check out their menu here: http://www.rarewelldone.com/menu.php)
Those of us who are looking for nutritional hints, will also appreciate that they mark their menu options with D (= Dairy) , L (= Low Fat) 
and V (= Vegetarian).

We opted for chicken that day and had the \"Roast Chicken & Avocado\" with some \"Red Bowl Chili\" as a side.

Very enjoyable.

The ciabiatta was toasted in a panini press and the toppings (arugula, plum tomato, caramelized onion, roasted red pepper) were really fresh. 
The balsamic vinaigrette gave it a nice touch.
We also liked the chili which had a nice kick, but wasn't too spicy.

I wouldn't mind to come back and try something else. :)"}
{"text":"To be honest I have been tardy in reviewing the places I have eaten in the last couple of months. I really don't remember being here or what I ate. I will have to check it out again. 

If it was the soup and sandwich place it was great. Otherwise I don't remember! ha!"}
{"text":"I went to the urban eatery in search for a decent salad. I tried the salad from fast fresh the time before and I really enjoyed it. This time, I decided to choose something different in search for variety. I got the big bowl salad that offers 6 toppings and I paid about 10.75 or something because I added a small soup for 88cents. 

The salad itself was very bad. I got the mixed salad base and six additional toppings. They do NOT give a generous portion of each topping compared to fast fresh but I was hoping the taste would compensate. I chose the honey balsamic vinaigrette and the lady mixed it all together in a bowl for me. When i went home, I was quite dissapointed as the salad was bland and tasteless. The sauce was not tasty and I felt i was just eating a very wet salad.  

The soup I got for 88cents however was a lot better. I got the coconut milk squash soup and it was actually very good. It was spicy which I like and it was quite creamy. For 88cents I'd say it was definitely worth it. 

From the other reviews, I hear their sandwiches are pretty good. However, if you're looking for a good salad. DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"While checking out the Eaton Centre yesterday over my lunch hour I thought I'd try and get some holiday shopping done.  Well, that turned out to be an epic fail and since I was hungry, I thought I may as well grab lunch while I was there.

The new Urban Eatery is probably one of the coolest \"mall food courts\" I've seen in a long time.  After walking by numerous spots, I decided on Rare.  

Rare is a sandwich shop, located at the north west end of the Urban Eatery.  Their freshly made rare beef sandwiches are prominently featured on their menu, however, they also offer chicken, turkey and vegetarian sandwich options on their Expresss Daily Sandwiches.  All of their sandwiches are served with soup or salad. 

I ordered the Pico (pico de gallo, caramelized onions, and bell peppers, lime-spiked crema, monterey jack and of course rare roast beef) with a quinoa salad.  Ordering was fairly easy and as I watched the sandwich girl make my sandwich I couldn't help but think \"that's a lot of beef!\"  Now, in stark contrast to the beef portion was the sad tablespoon and a half of quinoa salad they threw into the take out salad bowl.  The salad bowl was tiny to begin with, but the fact that they don't even fill the salad \"cup\"...honestly, it was not even 1/3 full!  I was really disappointed because the salad was delicious...quinoa with cranberries, apple pieces and a sesame oil dressing...delicious, but sadly the microscopic serving size left me both wanting more and resenting them for giving me such a teensy tiny portion.

The star attraction, the beef sandwich was DELICIOUS.  The fresh rare roast beef had been thinly sliced and quickly dipped in an au jus before being placed on the whole wheat bun and then topped with all the ingredients mentioned above.  THEN, once assembled was put in a panini press to heat it up for a few minutes and perfectly melt the monterey jack cheese. What can I say, it was a rare roast beef sandwich symphony.

As delicious as the sandwich was, I still can only bring myself to give it 2 stars...with a total price tag of $10.11, without a drink, I kind of felt a bit of wallet rape anxiety after the insult of consuming my 1 1/2 tablespoons of quinoa salad.  The sting is still there."}
{"text":"A good place for tasty sandwiches and soups.  They have a variety of both everyday.  Everything is fresh, which is rare at a fast food place - pun intended!"}
{"text":"I had the coconut curry squash soup which I wad excited to try. I felt like the coconut curry part was entirely left out. Overall very boring."}
{"text":"First place I went to eat in Toronto.  I'm starting and walked into teh Eaton Centre expecting to find a regular ol'food court...and holy smokes did I find a high class clean eating enviornment that was awesome!

Rare....Eat More Salad and roast beef joint...just my kinda style of food place.  The food was awesome especially the amount of orders they were working on a Monday afternoon lunch rush.

I had the roast beef and a salad....awesomeness"}
{"text":"VIBE 
It's in a food court but their outlet stands out because of that big fat font and organized lines. One for soup and one for everything else. Love! 

I ATE 
Coconut Curry Squash. CCS is like the exotic girl in school; I was intrigued. I wanted to be friends with CCS. It would be a different friendship (get your mind out of the gutter...this is soup we're talking about). But CCS quickly became the one that wasn't good enough - always the last one to be picked for the team. Why? Because while promising, CCS was thick but not thick enough, had some spice but not enough--it needed more pepper or something. Maybe some chicken or chunk would have made CCS a bit more popular (chunk is in these days right?) And CCS didn't have that something extra. That extra would be bread. I get crackers at my work cafeteria with soup and I'm paying $5 for CCS and you can't give me a slice of bread (preferably with a little packet of butter)? Come on. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Though CCS was okay, I'll try something different next time. I have hope Rare will be a Medium-well reception for me next time."}
{"text":"The chicken parm is pretty good, but i think it'd be a lot better if the chicken was warm instead of cold.  They do put the sandwich in the toaster for a moment.  Regardless, it does taste good and the bread is very soft and has a nice spread on it inside."}
{"text":"I had previously reviewed this fast food establishment after having their chicken vindaloo soup.  Today I tried their mango chicken salad and I felt compelled to update my review because this was one of the worst salads I have ever had!  I could barely find any chicken, honey lime vinaigrette was tasteless and the whole thing was $10.16 (including tax).  Very expensive and not worth the money.  I was so hungry so I ended up eating half and throwing the rest of way.  Very disappointing.  I knew there was a reason I brought my lunch most days.  What a rip off!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Delicious roast beef sandwiches but a bit pricey.

In my mission to try everything the Urban Eatery at least once, I had low expectations for Rare not only because of the reviews on Yelp, but also the seemingly empty line-ups in front all the time. 

But boy was wrong! I had their Portabella roast beef sandwich it was better than anything from the other fast food sandwich places like Quiznos, Subway, Mr. Sub, etc.. The roast beef was plentiful and tender and the caramelized onions and portabella chunks were flavourful. I had their black bean and chorizo soup, but it seemed more like a vegetable soup to me. Of note, their \"snack size\" soup bowl is REALLY small - it's barely larger than your standard styrofoam cups you see at the dollar store. If their soup bowls were bigger, it would be a $10 well spent."}
{"text":"Rare is a niche restaurant that does 2 things extremely well. Roast Beef sandwiches and Soup. Your typical combo either is a sandwich with a soup or salad.  What you want to get is relative but either choices are fine. I recommend more of the soup in the fall and winter periods and salad for the summer time.

Basically get their signature food, the Roast Beef sandwiches. They have nice roast beef sitting on a cutter and churns out the slices when you order. They then soak/warm the sliced roast beef in beef broth retaining/enhancing the beefy flavours before putting it on a bread with your dressings.  Then in it goes to a toaster and it comes out hot and toasty.  It is as good as it sounds. Only flaw I noticed is do not take your time eating the sandwich.  When it goes through the beef broth it becomes wet which soaks into the bread causing soggy bread. The longer you take to eat the more soaked the bread becomes until it falls apart other than that I still grab an order there before heading off to night class at Ryerson."}
