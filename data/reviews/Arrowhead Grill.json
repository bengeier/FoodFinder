{"text":"The two of us chose Arrowhead Grill for a Valentine's day and glad we did. We both had prime rib, but different sides. The food and service were Great! Our waiter made that night one of the Best evening we have had in a long while. Needless to say we left the restaurant very satisfied."}
{"text":"Food was great. Management poor! We were asked to leave or move to make room for other people. Will not return. I was warned by others of the rude management."}
{"text":"We went back to Arrowhead Grill last night, and weren't as impressed as we were the last couple of times we were there.  The menu changed - not for the better I might add.  We had the Valentines Day Special, which used to include dessert for the entire price of the special, but now they're charging an extra $4.99 per dessert.  The waitress didn't even mention this extra charge to us.  When I mentioned this to the manager, they compensated that part of the bill which was generous.  But what really upset me was how they automatically added a 20% gratuity to the bill.  That does NOT sit well with me.  A gratuity should be at the customer's discretion based on service.  Things seemed way overpriced compared to last time."}
{"text":"I came here recently for a work related dinner during a weeknight. 

The ambience, service, and food were all very good.  

The location could be better, but once inside it exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time though we live just down the street. We started by sharing a small spinach salad, which was just enough for the two of us. He had the AG grilled salmon, and I had the Delmonico steak. Both were prepared wonderfully and tasted delicious. We didn't have time for dessert, but will next time! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great first time experience! Food, service and attention to detail. The food exceeded expectations and restaurant was busy and had good energy. Lots of locals chatting with staff. That's always a good sign. Servers had good menu knowledge and bartender was outstanding picking up the slack from our busy server and taking care of the bar. All without looking too busy or put out. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place's steak is probably the best I've ever had, I moved in down the street like 6 months ago and had been recommended to go here but never got around to it but I finally did and I'm glad I did it's probably pricier than you thought but the food and service is worth it"}
{"text":"I expected AG to be an equal to Durants, but that didn't happen.  I'm only referring to the filet, which was overcooked, bland and had no flavor.  

On a positive note, the lobster tail was tasty, the wine my sever suggested was the bomb and the service was top notch.  

I ended with a flourless chocolate cake (Confirmed Celiac).  It was delish.  So delish, I'm taking some home!

I'll give this place another shot at meat...."}
{"text":"My husband took me here as a pre-valentine's day surprise and it was absolutely delightful.  The food was excellent. I had the surf and turf oscar style with broccoli and cheese on the side. Opted for the New York strip and it did not disappoint.  My husband got the AG potatoes with the AG Delmonico steak and he loved every bite. We will absolutely be back. However because it is so pricey we will probably just opt to come back for special occasions!  Overall well worth it; you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible; Superior customer service, AMAZING food and a relaxing atmosphere all under one roof. Although, the food is a tad pricey it's worth EVERY penny!! Has a great bar area in the back and a nice restaurant on the other side. I really can't say enough about what great customer service, clean place and SUPER delicious food they have. EVEN the french fries were amazing ... but my mouth is still watering on the steak I had."}
{"text":"I have no idea why AG is not rated 5 stars... because it completely desrves it.

I have tried several expensive steak houses (Flemings, Ruths Chris, Harris', etc.), but none compares to Arrowhead Grill.  They are moderately priced-- you have to expect to pay some money for a great steak, so those who complain about it being too expensive obviously didn't know what they were getting into.  The filet mignon and 10 oz. Delmonico are both OUTSTANDING.  Never a need for ANY steak sauce.

Because I like so many things here, I will just list them.  Pretzel appetizer (very cheap considering the menu), trio of fries, chicken tacos appetizer, chili mac n cheese, loaded baked potato, carmelized onions, strawberry and chocolate fondue, key lime pie, creme brulee.  ALL are great.

This is a true steak restaurant, so all sides are served a la carte."}
{"text":"The NY Strip was top notch cooked to a perfect medium rare. Prosciutto wrapped asparagus and the AG mashed potatoes made for the best meal I've had in a long while. Amazed at the wine selection and the service was top notch. 

A great upscale steakhouse with a casual touch in the WV!"}
{"text":"very good food, great service.  I had the NY Strip, and it was very tasty.  They have this yummy smores dessert, you have to get that!  This is a place you would go to and get a bottle of wine too, for a special occasion.  But overall, for what you get, I don't feel it's that overpriced."}
{"text":"If you are looking for somewhere nice and on the upper scale, this place is perfect for that special occasion. I don't really do a lot of fine dining, and my only real comparison is Flemings. I would go here over Flemings any day. Service was great and there was nothing wrong with any of the food. Hot, fresh, and fast. Of course it is pricey so we won't be eating here often, but when I want to celebrate I will be coming here!"}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices could use a little help with the staff's attentiveness. But all in all love it and have back several times!! Not to mention the Chocolate ding dong is amazing!!"}
{"text":"If this is the best steakhouse on the west side,  I will gladly drive an extra 100 miles to avoid it.

As you walk in the front door of this \"fancy\" steakhouse,  look at the dirty thread bare club chair to your left.  The tables are bare,  small and too close to each other.  People on the way to the restrooms bumped into our table.  The noise level was unpleasantly high.  The chairs are uncomfortable.  The overall decor is okay. They spent more on the ceiling bling than customer comforts. The staff rarely smiled. I will take competence and good food over congeniality. This place lacked all three. 

The waitress was attentive at the level of a flight attendant pushing a snack cart.  Adequate, but not what you expect from a fancy high (over) priced steak house. 

My steak was tough and overcooked.   I ordered medium done and it was almost well done.  It occurred to me that maybe I mistakenly received another person's steak.  My wife ordered the same as mine and her steak was much rarer than mine.   When I questioned the waitress she said that I let my hot plate over cook the steak.  I almost went through the roof. When the check came they did not charge for my steak. In the end the steak cost what the Arrowhead Grill felt it was worth, nothing.

I was served a birthday dessert  ten minutes before everyone else finally received their desserts.  At the risk of being impolite, I was reluctant to eat my dessert before every one else got theirs.   While I was waiting for five others in our party to receive their desserts they tried to take mine away.  What!? 

Too expensive for the service,  ambiance and quality offered.   Everything is ala carte.  For example,  $8 for mashed potatoes is little high, isn't it?  I am amazed at the five star reviews.  I gave two stars instead of one star because they didn't charge me for their mis-steak.  Trust me, our check was plenty high anyway."}
{"text":"Cool place where I had an enjoyable dinner with my wife. Leave the kids somewhere else. I don't recommend kids."}
{"text":"The food is decent for the neighborhood, but the customer service needs some serious help. I asked the hostess if I needed to put my name on the list for the bar area. She stated \"first come first serve.\" The first table in bar area that came open I sat down and the bartender asked me to please get up that people were waiting for the table.  He said what the hostess stated was true, but he had his \"own list\""}
{"text":"We had dinner here Wednesday evening - party of 4 - GABE was our server - everything was outstanding from the wine to the desert ! Having read the reviews on Arrowhead Grill we were ready for the best experience or the worst experience in the West Valley one could imagine. We had the Ahi and the Prime Rib and both were perfect. The asparagus was wonderful. The wine was cheap and very, very good. Our party of 4 consisted of a trained French Chef, a Hyatt Food and Beverage Restaurant Manager, a retired CEO and an active golfer.
For the money spent this was one of our best Phoenix area dinners and we will return.  Harry, Margo, Pat and Roger !!"}
{"text":"Third-class Restaurant
Very expensive - Very over-priced

When dining out, the husband of our dinner guests always orders the Filet. The Arrowhead waiter aggressively sold him on ordering the Kobe Delmonico, at a much higher price, instead. Waiter said the Kobe was \"lavishly marbled throughout, melt-in your mouth tender, and was 5 levels about any other cut.\" What he was served was a cut that was devoid of any marbling, tough as sinew; a flank steak from a cutter and canner would have been a better steak. He sent it back and ordered the filet he was going to order in the first place. The filet was good, but by then the dining experience had been severely degraded. He had to sit and watch the 3 of us have dinner, then we had to sit and watch him eat his dinner after it came. And of course the pleasant dining he anticipated, evaporated. Also at the waiter's suggestion, we ordered their special artichoke appetizer. It was the worst artichoke that any of us had tasted, almost dried out with very little meat. The other 3 ordered a small size salad. I ordered the large salad. Waiter served us 4 small salads. I reminded him I had ordered large, he disappeared into the kitchen with my salad and returned about 15 seconds later with a larger bowl into which I believe he had just dumped my smaller salad. The ambiance is very ordinary. More like a banquet room than an expensive high star restaurant. A first rate restaurant would have no-charged my guest's dinner as compensation for ruining our dining experience, but they didn't. We ordered desert, and a 2nd rate restaurant would have compted the desert as compensation. They didn't. The next day I called to speak with the manager and was told he would return my call. He didn't. Very 3rd rate. Very bad dining experience."}
{"text":"We stoped here on our way home from Lake Pleasant with two little ones, no one even talked to us, said a word during or on our way out, probably because the way we were dressed, except our waiter, he was really nice, we were just told to sit at the nearest table no one bothered to take us or give us menus, we had to ask for them, received only one... food was ok nothing special. Probably will not go back"}
{"text":"Arrowhead Grill is on of the best kept secrets and best steakhouses on the West Side.  It has an upscale atmosphere and a la carte meal choices that have portions large enough to share with 2 or more people.  What a great option for those that live in Arrowhead, Surprise, Sun City, Glendale, Peoria, North Phoenix and even Anthem."}
{"text":"Christmas Eve dinner at a so called steakhouse.   Arrived early for our 630 reservation and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  Once we did get a table we were seated at a four top that seemed to be pretty close to other tables.  I am a decent sized man 6'4\" 240 lbs. and I seemed cramped next to the table next to us. Someone mentioned that they could of squeezed more tables in for the holiday and I hope that was not the case.
 Water and bread came and the name of our server.  Sadly the server did not come back for at least 1o minutes.  Waters sat unfilled and the bread was already eaten.  Our server finally did make it to our table to make sure we did have waters but was not able to take our beverage order yet.   Eighteen minutes after we sat down we got our drink order in.  We then place entrée orders with sides.
 Food arrives at a  STEAKHOUSE and what was the star of the show?   The steaks, Nyet, it was the sides.   Thick onion rings were horrendously lacked girth liked the so called claimed.   Green Chile Mac and Cheese was decent (Making my own mac and cheese for xmas tomorrow we shall see whose is better).   Wife ordered the signature Daminco medium.  Steak was cooked to ordered, season decent but was nothing fantastic.   I ordered 22 oz bone in ribeye with blue cheese sauce.   Steak came out with a bone about as big as the bone in ribeyes  you find at Fry's on their July 4th sale.   No blue cheese sauce,nothing.   To there credit they did take is back, put blue cheese on it and put it under the broiler.  Overall the taste of the steak reminded me of what I cook on the weekend.  Nothing great here.
 Had to give the place 2 stars.  Negatives:  Horrible Service, Mundane Steaks far outweighed positives: Good sides

I would recommend you take you car either downtown to old school steakhouse like Durants or dress up a tad bit nicer and hit a Flemmings or Ruth Chris'.  If you want the best of the best hit up a Mastro's.   Nothing compares
 d"}
{"text":"The steak is amazing!! It's high priced but well worth it. They have some specials on the Sunday and Monday so it's a good time to be able to try it out. The staff is a bit on the grumpy side but hopefully they will work on that."}
{"text":"Pros: 
1. ambience - nice but honestly it's nothing to rave about. There are plenty of restaurants with a much nicer atmosphere 
2. service
3. easy to find location
Cons: 
1. it's so dark inside that I had to use a flashlight on my phone to read the menu! It was ridiculous 
2. our party of five agreed that food quality does not justify such high prices. 

Overall, I was disappointed, especially after reading so many positive reviews. My expectations, based on these reviews have not been met, even halfway. I would not recommend this restaurant. It's all hype and a little substance."}
{"text":"We got their signature steak (Delmonico) with shrimp on top. It was really good! Service and ambiance is nice. They have a small butter cake that's just the right size and my wife loved it. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service.  Will come here again!  A gem so close to our house.  Better than Durantes where we went last year!"}
{"text":"We love Arrowhead Grill.  There are not alot of really great restaurants her in the NW valley, so Arrowhead Grill is a regular for us.  Great wine list, great steaks, and always friendly with my cooking/preparing requests.  Roo is a regular waitress of ours and just wonderful."}
{"text":"We love Arrowhead Grill!  The drinks are excellent, the food is delicious, and 5 times out of six the wait staff is spectacular!  If you get a chance to meet Charles, you're in luck.  He's the man.  My favorites are the Gorgonzola gnocchi and, thanks to Charles, the butter cake!  Try the calamari, too, and anything that comes from a cow."}
{"text":"We went to arrowhead grill for dinner.I had the salmon.it was good,but plain.no seasoning or sauce.also everything is a la carte so if you want a side of veggies it costs almost $6.it's also very expensive in there.(which I do not mind if it's worth it.)but it just wasn't.food was good but not fantastic.the owner seems more concerned with schmoozing with 90 yr old customers who look like they have $ other than getting food cooked on time.I waited forever,like 30 mins.for my salmon while he was parading around the room with a phony grin on his face kissing only the old wealthy looking customers asses.he totally ignored anyone who appeared under the age of 40.I actually did not want to talk to him anyway,but if youre trying to appear as if you value all your customers don't pick and choose what tables you visit based on age,money,etc.btw I am in no means poor or raggedy looking,and tip better than most people.the service was o.k.nothing great.a few forgotten items,but I think it was because our server was new.she was very nice and apologetic so I did not mind so much.the decor was o.k.they try to say it's fine dining,but it looks like a regular ol restaraunt inside.in my opinion you can get the same quality food for a lot less at outback."}
{"text":"We love this place. It's pretty pricey, but worth it for a special occasion. We get the ribeye and delmonico steaks. The AG mashed potatoes are great."}
{"text":"We went to Arrowhead Grill for a special occasion on Sunday night.  We got there at 5:00 pm.  Our server was Mark and he was horrible.  Very Unfriendly!  I ordered the Prime Rib medium rare and when it came out it was Medium well and was not good.  After paying our bill of $81.00 (including $7 tax) we put a $20 bill on the table and asked our waiter for $3 back.  He was obviously mad that we didn't give him the entire $20 and marched off to get our change.  When he returned he had circled a receipt showing the value of a free appetizer we received.  He added three !!! to show his displeasure in our tip.  We had added the $11 appetizer when we figured out our 20% tip.  We left saying we will never go back there again.  Way too much money for Bad food and a horrible waiter!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific food. If you love steak, you'll love AG. I've eaten at Arrowhead Grill several times and have never been disappointed. Love the Delmonico steak. Cooked to perfection. The bar is also fun for hanging out, watching sports and enjoying the happy hour specials. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"To begin, the atmosphere is calming and inviting. The decor of the restaurant in general has a warm modern feel to it. The greeter and the waiter were very kind and courteous. The waiter gave out great suggestions, and was open to any questions I may have. The food was unbelievably good. The Delmonico steak is a must-try! Even ordered well-done, the steak remained juicy and not charred like you would see normally on that type of finish. Their selection of wines is vast, though I also recommend their \"Flights of Fancy\". Overall an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Very good upscale, steaks, seafood and desserts served in nice, straightforward ways.  Nothing is creative - but it is very good. 

There are numerous side dishes promoted for \"family style\" sharing service.  While good, these side dishes are not served in particularly large portions and are probably not sharable for all.  So some may conclude the side dishes are unfairly priced considering size and how they're promoted. 

The wait staff were very friendly, knowledgeable and efficient.  

The only significant criticism I have is that the noise levels were quite loud.  It was difficult to carry on conversation in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour, awesome food and great service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the best steakhouse on the West side of town. I've been a few times and the food is amazing, and the service has been fabulous each time. Get the butter cake as a desert if you have room, it's like nothing I've had before. Really great place."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant for 3 years.  I have never been disappointed. I drive from the middle of Phoenix to eat here passing many other restaurants on the way.  The steaks are delicious no matter what the cut.  My wife prefers the seafood dishes and has never been disappointed.  This place just celebrated its fifth anniversary which is a major milestone in the Phoenix area.  This is no doubt due to the great food that is served but also the attentive staff.  The manager  is very involved and attentive to make sure your dining experience is one that you truly enjoy.  They also have a great wine selection.  I have taken many friends here over they years who have become regulars. It has become my \"go to\" place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for their happy hour and I've dined here for dinner. Their food is always amazing, and the service is always great. We celebrated our anniversary last visit and they made it special with a butter cake for dessert free of charge. We are always happy when we dine here."}
{"text":"I just don't understand all of these \"less than stellar\" reviews.  I bought a house in the neighborhood and found this place two years ago.  Every experience at this restaurant while dining several times a month have been positive.  The food and service has always been great.  Although I've not had the opportunity to send something back, I think some of the reviewers should have informed their server that that the dish didn't meet their expectations."}
{"text":"My family went to Arrowhead Grill 2 years ago and still talk about it.  We had a great meal.  It was my brother's birthday and we had a great 3 course meal.  What we remember best is stumbling upon such an amazing restaurant, where we each had a great filet (medium rare).  We were in town for the Fiesta Bowl and had no idea where to go or where to eat.  The next time we are anywhere near the area, we will definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Great spot!  Food was excellent.  Had the prime rib which melted in my mouth and loaded baked potato, largest I have ever seen.  Great atmosphere at the bar and good service."}
{"text":"My husband's Christmas party with Campbell developments in the private room awesome service awesome food they handled every little detail perfectly all the servers were nice drinks service food service and corrections were handled professionally manager came over to make sure we were all happy we would return if we didn't live an hour and a half away"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the West Valley. The food is fantastic all around. The steaks are perfection!  It is a bit of an older crowd and a little on the pricey side but worth every penny. The service is very good and they have good wine list."}
{"text":"I dined here with a few friends recently and will parrot what so many other reviewers said.  The food was excellent.  My steak was cooked to perfection, the waiter was very attentive bringing the wine I pre-ordered exactly when I wanted it. 

They close at 11:00 on Friday and we arrived about 9:40 so we were there until about 30 minutes  after closing to finish our meal, and the staff just went about their side-work... no one tried to rush us out of the restaurant - much appreciated! 

If I could find any fault at all, I think the meat was somewhat over-seasoned, but the taste was still excellent.  This seems to be a trend in high-end restaurants as I'm experiencing it in many of the places I've eaten over the past few years.  I do eat salt and heavily season my own cooking, so I'd venture to say it's not me.  Would definitely eat here again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in you know you are in for a dining experience. The ambiance is upscale chop house the feeling is family,the staff are extremely friendly. The menu is great offering wet aged beef as well as a good lineup of seafood. The sides are family style and delicious. I had the 22oz porterhouse it was so tender I could almost cut it with a fork. There are sauce toppings available for the steaks but why bother with perfection. Marcie our server was informative of the menu, friendly with excellent recommendations. The rest of the staff were also very attentive and efficient and most friendly. I felt I was being served by friends I've known a long time. My highest recommendations for Arrowhead Grill."}
{"text":"We went to Arrowhead Grill for lunch a little after 1:00 PM on a Tuesday. We were immediately seated. We then sat for close to 10 minutes waiting for a server. I finally went back to the hostess to find out what was the problem. They were not at all busy. Soon a waitress came over and apologized for the confusion on who was our server. Apparently it is not unusual for a table to sit without any thing on the table. Otherwise someone from a sever to a manager would have noticed. 

Two of us had the prime rib sandwich. At $12.99 I was expecting a sandwich that tasted good and had some meat on it. I couldn't believe how small and how little meat was on the sandwich. It did taste good but not $13 good. Plus there was a piece of bone or something hard that I bit on. It was impossible to tell what it was. The slaw that came with the sandwich was completely without flavor. I ended putting the horseradish sauce from the sandwich on the slaw. The sweet potato fries that came with the other sandwich were ok, nothing better nothing worse.

The third member of our party ordered the onion soup and house salad. He thought both were very good. 

For dessert we had the chocolate bread pudding. First of all why do restaurant feel that the dessert should feed a family of four? The bread pudding was larger than the sandwiches. It was ok but the chocolate covered up the taste of the bread. Why have bread pudding if you can't taste the bread?

Finally the service we had after they decided who would wait on us was fine. Except before we had received our dessert the waitress came over and said she needed to leave. She offered to transfer us to the other waiter there. I asked if she did, would she get the tip. She said no, so we paid before finishing with the meal. If she had to leave early why didn't they give us the other server to start with?

They did give us a coupon for $10 off our next visit. I won't be using it. 

For the price, the service is not good enough and the quantity and quality of the food is not up to par."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night and the food and service was outstanding.  I had the Delmonico steak with lobster mashed potatoes. Wonderful! It was my birthday, so we got a complimentary butter cake and ice cream.  Outstanding! I wish I had the recipe.  I would love to go back."}
{"text":"Let's start with WOW.  Best steak on the west side by far.  Our waitress Kim was absolutely amazing.  Makes you feel like you have known her for years.  Let me give you the run down..
12oz filet apuave
Carmelized cream corn
Lobster mashed potatoes
Prosciutto wrapped asparagus
Make your own s'mores..  (With fire) 
I would go back and bring friends"}
{"text":"I was in from out of town and looking for a place to take my wife.  We were in the mood for a real good aged steak, classic sides and old school steak house ambiance. 

I had a porterhouse which was a nice cut but was not aged and was seasoned (ala Emeril Lagasse).  My wife had the fillet which she said was a good cut, also seasoned which she enjoys.  We had cream corm (fantastic), scalloped potatoes which was cubed home fries with melted cheese (needs work), and prosciutto wrapped asparagus which sounded great but should be removed from the menu immediately.  

The dining experience was nice but the atmosphere is bland and décor unappealing.  There is no warmth or personality to the interior design.  If they moved out Red Lobster could move right in.  The help was accommodating and prompt.  My expectations may have been a little high but there were people in flip flops, shorts and baseball caps which tells you something.  Be careful, they heat up the plates which results in the meat juices sizzling and popping all over the place.  I will send them my dry cleaning bill.  The waitress actually apologized for the flying meat juices.  Nice effect if I were at a fajita joint.  

Bottom line, this is an above average steak restaurant not a steak house."}
{"text":"When it comes to going out for a steak in the Phoenix metro area. I've been to just about all the good ones. Mastro's owned or affiliated places like Mastro's in North Scottsdale or Mastro's Ocean Club, City Hall, or Ruths Chris. Arrowhead Grill's USDA Prime Steak is the best I've had. I've been there 4 times now and have not had a bad Steak there. Actually all of them have been awesome. Cooked just the way I wanted it. 

As for appetizers I usually get the pretzel fondue. The pretzel bread is soft and sprinkled with pretzel salt. The chees dip it comes with seems to be a mix of cheese sauce with added flavor or dijon mustard. Its very good. 

As for sides dishes they are served family style. If its 2 or 3 people you are fine, but if you have any more than that the sides seem to be a little small. I've had the broccoli and cheese, Mashed Yukon Gold Potatoes,  Cheese Potatoes, Green beans, and cream corn in my visits. All are very good. I did have the Mac& cheese, but I thought it was to granular in the cheese sauce texture. maybe slightly bland. 

Pricing is much more reasonable from Prime cuts of meat, than compared to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Shrimp cocktail served on dry ice comes \"smoking\" to your table! Very cool!   The staff treated us great. I had the strawberry fondue for dessert. Decadent!!!   My only issue was that prime rib shouldnt be cooked like a steak. Besides that my first dining experience was very good at arrowhead grill."}
{"text":"So disappointed with the food and service.  Dinner lasted 2 1/2 hours and it wasn't due to the restaurant being busy.  

We had the Prime Rib Special  which turned out to not be \"special\" at all.  The order came out wrong and the slice of prime rib my husband got was small and thin, I can't believe they would even put that on someone's plate!  Not long after dinner both my husband and I felt ill.  I woke up at 3:30 in the morning with a stomach ache which lasted well into the late morning. My husband felt sick before bed and when he woke up too.  We're thinking it may have been the clam chowder that was bad it's hard to say, I wasn't impressed with any of the food. I definitely will not go back there ever!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this place for our first time a few weeks ago. We didn't know anything about it other than its a steakhouse in our general area. Because of this we had no expectations going in.

Turned out to be a great food experience. Our server was very helpful and when she found out we were first timers she gave us a brief overview of the restaurant and the menu. 

Turns out from what she said the guy who owns it used to work with Ruth's Chris and that is the influence of this restaurant. We have been to Ruth's Chris many times and I can tell you this has all the best of that but even more and we both agreed the food was better here.

Our server even told us about the world famous butter cake and hooked us up with a free dessert so we could try it. Honestly, one of the best desserts either of us have had. Who knew something seemingly so simple could be so good. Make sure you save room for it.

So long Ruth's Chris, I'll take this place anyday."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner a few nights ago as we wanted to check out a new spot. We don't mind paying for good quality food. Our waitress was over the top sometimes. Basically read the whole menu to us when we said it was our first time. We had already had time to read the menu and we can read so that was about five minutes of our time she totally wasted. She then compared AG to Maestro's and Ruth Chris which was a huge mistake. I love Maestro's lobster mashed potatoes so when she made that comparison and I saw it on the menu I was like ok, this should be great. NOT. They were runny and EXTREMELY salty. The rub on the steak was also very salty. I think someone in the kitchen has a strong salt fetish and obviously no one is QC what is leaving the kitchen w/ a small taste test. I ordered the Sea Bass and the fish was in like a pyramid shape that made the fish about 3 inches tall and very thick. Obviously this type of uneven cut will affect the cooking. So I felt the inside was cooler and not as done as the thinner, outside parts and that made my stomach turn. Who cuts a fish like this? I have never seen that done. Then the lovely complimentary butter cake came for being our first time there. It's their \"signature\" dessert. BLAH, it did not impress me. Sorry I seem hard to please but when you set an expectation and compare yourself to 5-star restuarants, I expect you to deliver. Maybe try under promising and over delivering."}
{"text":"Food was great so was the service.  Prepared exactly how we asked and didn't take an excessive amount of time even though it was very busy when we were  seated.  We had a reservation so the wait wasn't bad even though we we were early. Prices are on the high end but they defiantly provide a nice atmosphere.  Nice way to spend our anniversary, the free dessert didn't hurt either."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been anxiously awaiting the  opening of the Arrowhead Grill in hopes that it would be our new favorite steak!  When we noticed that the restaurant had just opened we went right in not knowing what to expect.

The Arrowhead Grill, located in the old Cocoon's building, offers an upscale dining experience.  With seemingly small changes to the interior of the restaurant Arrowhead Grill provides a romantic atmosphere, great service and delicious food.

You will find yourself ordering from an Ala cart menu at Arrowhead Grill.  My husband and I shared a large Cesar salad, each ordered a sirloin steak, baked potato, and a coke.   While the sirloin and the potato were cooked perfectly we would order the salad with lite dressing next time.

With such a great review why only four stars?  Price.  We spent just over $80 for our dinners.  For this strip mall location it seemed la bit pricey.  In all honesty for the money we would rather travel to The Keg or eat out at Outback twice."}
{"text":"Their Dell Monaco is a Ruth's Chris quality steak at outback steak house price (Not adjusting for the fact that their steak is a la carte, of course). Good shit."}
{"text":"Ignored at bar table.  Were told all tables at bar were open.  Went to move and it was then reserved.  Never got anything but water and never saw a waitress.  Left after about 20 min.  Never got a drink order in at all.  Let alone food. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Wow!  If you are looking for a to-die-for steak, excellent, friendly and informed servers and a a wonderful wine list you have come to the right place.  Also a great date place.  Sadly for me, I was not on a date, but just getting off work and in need of an amazing glass of wine. Despite my sister's and my casual dress (we were wearing scrubs) we were made to feel positively pampered!  While the steaks are expensive (but worth it, and this is an Omahan's opinion), anyone can make a full and more affordable meal out of the numerous and delicious side dishes. This is my new favorite happy hour place!  At least until I can get a date. ;)"}
{"text":"One word....AMAZING!!!  Went here for an after holiday get together and could not have been happier with each and every course.  They have quality beers, (our friends loved their wine selection), I had the Delmonico, my gf had the filet...both superb (I'm from Iowa, born and raised on good beef).  The twice baked potato and mashed potatoes rock (ask for the \"Arrowhead potatoes...our friends said they're to die for). And for dessert, I had the chocolate cake and my gf had the butter cake...both absolutely awesome in their own ways.  It is a bit pricey but is definitely worth it.  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pricey but the food is always excellent and the quality of the meat and fish is top notch."}
{"text":"Date night with my wife. Got us in pretty quick. Service was great. Food is good. Steak is a little over sauced. Over a pleasant experience. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hey I'm a steak kinda person , and when I'm on the west side of town, which I always am . This is where to go !!! Bitchin steaks , great fish & wonderful service ! Great place to celebrate a special occasion. Missing that fifth star though because they need to update their finishings a bit . Kick Ace Place"}
{"text":"A regular of ours. Wind down Wednesday is awesome. Had Thanksgiving dinner st AG. Absolutely incredible. All staff from host, bartenders, to bus and waiter staff are top notch. One of my favorite places in the valley."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since they have been in business. The best Delmonico New York Strip I have ever had. Everywhere I go I try the Delmonico and no one can put a candle to Chef Charles Version. You must thy the Lamb chop appetizer it is out of the world. I love to see this restaurant improve a bit on there service sometimes it is great and other times it is so so. Bottom line this is my favorite place for a steak on the west side."}
{"text":"First time my fiance and I were here would have given it three stars value was great, happy hour food was great but steak was just blah. We went back today 6 months later and blown away. Everything was amazing. One of the best cheese plates I've had in a long time and the rack of lamb let me tell you. Even if you don't like lamb get the rack of lamb it is out of this world my fiance doesn't like lamb and she loved it. Her strip was so flavorful. Overall this place really made an impression on us the second time around and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Just got back from here...  Wow.  The delmonico was superb.  Equally matched with a double the price steak at Ruth Chris. Honestly  I've had steaks much more expensive that aren't as good as this..  The macaroni was excellent.  Everything was exceptional.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Went for Valentines Day and everything we had was amazing!  The food was cooked to perfection.  We were a party of 6 - everyone ordering different things and all I can say was everyone thoroughly enjoyed every bite down to feeling so full we were waddling out.  We had everything from apps, sides, entrees and dessert.  The presentation of the food was out of this world.  I remember some of the food being served with sparklers and never seeing anything like it before (not sure if this was because it was Valentine's Day and a special thing on the menu or if they do it all the time).  Can't wait to go back.  Best place hands down to eat in the NW valley."}
{"text":"When people start checking in at this establishment and say things like \"OMG, so delish\", \"about to sink my teeth into some goodness\", and \"I don't care what my doctor says about my cholesterol, I'm going to eat like royalty tonight\", then I have to try it. 

For the record, the service was great. We started off with the AG salad and the shrimp cocktail. They were great. I don't remember the specifics because once we got to the entrees, that is where things got out of control.

I ordered the bone-in ribeye, medium rare. And, I started having these reactions I've never experienced before. 

First off, just the sight and smell of it, made me salivate way too damn much; it was embarrassing. With each bite, it made me want to take another, and another, until I couldn't take anymore. And, don't get me started with the lobster mashed potatoes; there is crack laced in it, that I'm sure of. It was an addiction that was formed in such a short amount of time that I actually struggled to stop eating it after being full and made me question if I ever had the will power to control myself. 

Spoiler alert: I don't. I had the buttercake for dessert, which made me look at other desserts and think, \"you need to be more like buttercake: all golden, flaky, sweet, with ice cream\". 

If there ever was a time to challenge dining etiquette by changing into sweatpants in the middle of a meal, this would've been it.

However, I can't make a final judgement on the quality of the food without making another visit (I may need several). At the request of a friend, I will take his advice and try the Demonico but I am anxious as to how am I going to control the reactions I had last night. It'll be a battle, but I'm ready.



PS Best meal ever."}
{"text":"well.......I was taken here last night for my birthday dinner at the suggestion of a friend.  We were going to dine at The Keg because my request was Filet Mignon and King Crab Legs.  This place.....oy!  we had a 7:15 reservation.  had to wait for a few minutes to be seated....not a big deal.  we were sat and began to look at the menu.  PRICEY!  which is fine for us usually.  Asked our waitress Brittany if they had Filet and crablegs.....I was told that i had to order TWO plates.....one for steak and then another whole plate of crab legs.......huh?  12oz filet was $34 and 16oz crab legs plate was $46.........AND.......ALL of the entrees come with NO sides at all.....you have to order your sides seperately....another $8-$14 just for a side. WHAT?  no salad before....no nothing.  they brought bread out to the table....but they were breadsticks and they don't even give you enough for everyone at your table to have a whole one to themselves. put in our order......food arrived........40 minutes later?  are you kidding me?  yes,,,,,there was a well done steak in the mix......but that should have taken 20 minutes.  at the most!  our foodserver Brittany was EXTREMELY scarce!  extremelely!!!  the steak....when it finally came out.....was very good and fresh.....i will say that.......but the fries we ordered for my son.....came out cold.  sent them back......still room temperature.  and they tasted like they were fried in old grease. eh.  It was birthday and i didn't want to make the table of my guests feel uncomfortable by complaining.  so i zipped it. THEN.  I was told they would be bringing out a special dessert with a candle for my birthday.  okay.....cool.  brought out this big plate with a delicious dessert on it and a roman candle to blow out.  i think it was the butter cake....which was absolutely delicious.  

FINALLY......after flagging down the \"too busy to give us the great service we thought we were paying for\" Brittany.......we got the bill.  We had 6 ppl in our party.  two of the people split a steak.....my husband, son, and i split two filets....one 8 oz and one 12oz and a 16oz king crab leg......we had the french fry trio to split....lyonnaise potatoes.....and the lampchop fondue. our bill came to over $250.  How?  they charged us twice for the french fries that we sent back.......the sharing of the over priced meals....AND.......THE BIRTHDAY DESSERT????  they charged me for the birhtday dessert that THEY chose for me?  had i known that I would have liked to try something else on their dessert menu.  THEY CHARGED ME FOR A DESSERT I DIDN\"T EVEN GET TO PICK OUT.  I am in total disbelief of this place.  Don't go there.  we are by no means \"cheap\" people.  but like anyone else....don't like to go somewhere that we feel we were robbed and cheated out of a great dining experience. DO NOT EAT HERE.  you are better off paying the same amount of money.......getting great service..........and not feeling like you're robbed and any other reputable steak house. This place needs to do some serious thinking about their pricing and teach their foodservers that if you are going to work at a place that is that pricey....the service better be tip top!"}
{"text":"Haven't been disappointed yet.  Bar food is killer.  Service consistent and good.  Moscow mules are best I've had in area."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic dinner experience!! Was in town from CA visiting family and decided to try this place last Friday night. Staff was extremely professional. Michael was too kind and our server Steve was knowledgeable and spot-on!! My wife had the lamb chops and I had the bone-in ribeye. Outstanding meal!! We've been to steakhouses all over the world not to mention living in Vegas for years. This place ranks very high on my all time list...well done Arrowhead Grill!"}
{"text":"So I'm visiting a friend and she is raving about this place. I tell her I go to Daniel's Broiler in Seattle for cut-with-a butter knife kind of steak and she tells me this place is the same and everyone loves it. Ok. Sure. My measurement is based on the fact that the food better be tastier than what I can cook at home because I'm a pretty damn good cook and a food snob.
First the rosemary foccacia comes out and it's two slices for a three person table. Chintzy. So we have to ask for more bread right off the bat, so I'm already unimpressed. I order a starter of clam chowder and it's good but mine is a hundred times better (it's the recipe from Market Street Broiler in Salt Lake City...delish). We split a delmonico with shrimp scampi. It's pretty good, with a nice flavor. The shrimp were small and didn't have a particularly good flavor to them but the steak was nice. I've definitely had better but if you find yourself here, you will probably like your meal. Especially if you are a mediocre cook."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour menu at AG. The Steak Delmonico is always flavorful and cooked to order. Cocktails are good but a bit overpriced in my opinion. We usually being out of town guests here when we want a nice meal but don't want to drive too far. We love sitting out on the patio since it has been redone."}
{"text":"I'm writing a review before I've even had the main course!! The crab leg appetizer was incredible, and I don't even like seafood. The server is so friendly and they have a large staff that's on point! Refills before you finish your drink and no dirty plate on the table longer than 1 minute. Amazing!! Now my steak has arrived, I truly must go now!"}
{"text":"I'm not trying to get a free meal with this review. I just got home from AG, and I'll never go back again. I did say that before, about one year ago, but when the AG first opened they were so good I thought I'd give them another chance. The service was fair, my steak was okay, but not the steak I get for the price, $39+ anywhere else. Horrible side dish portions and quality for such inflated prices!!! Goodbye AG."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing little pricy that why I come for happy hour. If you haven't eaten here your missing out."}
{"text":"Very weird place. Bar opens at 3 pm and restaurant opens at 4 pm. No one greeting us while sitting in the bar- I see lots of staff but no one offers menu. Two taps  beers - even the people came right behind walked out. Don't know why they have so good rating if they cannot even greet their customer properly- feel like they are avoiding us ... no more weird restaurant"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and the food has been consistently great.  I've recently had the Delmonico steak which was cooked superbly medium rare.  I've had the halibut dish several months ago that I still remember its flavor.  Service is prompt. The staff is not very talkative due to them being pretty busy."}
{"text":"We've been there several times.  Tim has been our waiter each time.  Very professional and really knows his meat.  The Grill room itself is causal elegance.  The bar flows right into the Grill room so there is potential for sound issues if a big game is on but we haven't experienced a problem, but it could happen.

The outside seating area has misters and a big screen tv.  Nice spot for an after dinner dessert or drink."}
{"text":"Four of us had the prime rib dinner special last Sunday.  The prime rib was excellent, we are beef snobs as we grew up on home-raised beef and this was cooked perfectly with good seasonings.  The salads were all good, two had the Caesar and loved it. The sides were all very tasty with large portions for the sautéed mushrooms, the twice baked potato and the au gratin potatoes, we took home doggie bags. Same with dessert, the butter cake was very flavorful and the creme brûlée was finished at the table by burning the sugar atop and it too was excellent.  Service was attentive.  An excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic, fantastic and more fantastic. This is an outstanding restaurant. Our waitress Jessica was super. Attentive but not overly. Good with selections and did not rush us. We all had the Sunday and Monday night special of prime rib. A real bargain. You get a choice of salad or soup, the prime rib plus a side and a dessert  (will get to that later). Prime rib was  tender one didn't need a steak knife to cut it. All the bread and butter you want. Never had such a delicious and tender piece of meat. As if we weren't full already here comes your choice of desserts. I had key lime pie and others had brownie with ice cream. Brownie was huge and so delicious. This is a place to put on your list-- special occasion or not. The extended wait help is very good also. All staff treat you like you are special. My husband says they make a mean martini-that's how he rates a restaurant. Lol. You won't be disappointed. Try it."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times now. Tonight, we went for my in-laws 50th anniversary. From the moment we walked in, the staff was outstanding. They treated my in-laws very well. Several staff members stopped by to congratulate them. Our waiter, Todd, was very attentive and patient with them. He even gave them a beautiful dessert (with a sparkler!). On the plate, \"Happy 50th Anniversary\" was spelled out in chocolate. They also gave them a card and a coupon.

In regards to the food, we have had the prime rib, delmonico, tomahawk (bone-in ribeye), and porterhouse. Each of the cuts have been delicious. Tonight we tried the artisan macaroni and cheese...delicious...and the grilled artichoke. Everything has always been cooked to perfection. 

They have a good selection of wines. As another reviewer stated, the wines are a bit pricey, but not out of the ordinary for this type of steakhouse. 

They play light jazz music, creating a nice atmosphere.

The restaurant has been very clean each time we've come, and the staff interact with each other as a team, which is always nice to see."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great bar staff service and the most delicious free dessert if it's your first time! Sign up for emails for great deals and events. A little pricey, but that's o.k. especially if it's a special time in your life. Our go to special occasion location!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight around 4pm to try them out for the 1st time. I have to say the AG Burger is by far the best burger I've ever had, and I've had a lot of burgers in my life."}
{"text":"We made a reservation a few days before New Year's Eve, and surprisingly, our party of 5 was able to get a table.  It was very crowded but I must say that everything served was cooked to perfection despite a very busy evening.  Service was prompt and very friendly.  This was our first visit and We were impressed!  We went back last week for Happy Hour and again, the bar was almost full but we were able to snag a table for our party of 5.  Again, service was great and the food was wonderful.  We are going back again this week!"}
{"text":"Where do I start! We had a wonderful evening here! Start your adventure by going to their website and signing up for their email club. You get coupons and notices about special events! AG is on the level of Flemmings and Mastro's, pricey and delicious!

1. Food - We were offered a free appetizer for signing on up on their email club! We tried the pretzel fondue! It was outstanding! The pretzels were soft and the fondue sauce was delicious! For our main course we tried the prime rib and New York strip steak. Both were cooked to perfection! Very juicy and tasty! Our server Ryan, suggested a berenice sauce to go with our steak and prime rib, it was worth every penny! I couldn't get enough of it! The sides are severed family style, with the free appetizer we didn't want to over due it and only ordered one side. The parmesan gnocchi was outstanding, very tender and flavorful. I think I could have eaten just that for dinner and been content! 

2. Service - Our server Ryan was AWESOME! He took excellent care of us. He made excellent recommendations, was very prompt, and answered all of our questions. The manager came by twice to check on us as it was our first visit. Two thumbs up to the staff!

3. Tips - On the weekends, call ahead and make a reservation. They were quite busy. The restaurant can be noisy as it is very open, I would recommend sitting in a booth. They are open for lunch and run really good lunch specials! 

5 stars! We will be back soon for sure! I am dieing to try the bacon wrapped filet and prosciutto asparagus!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was excited to try this place because everyone said it was good.  I wasnt that impressed.  They tell you your getting Prime meats and they charge prime prices.  However, it was not prime.  Actually I have had better at Outback.I thought it was highly overrated, over priced and the staff was not that knowledgable or friendly.  My hubby had taken a huge bouquet of flowers and a candle for this special night and neither was on the table when we arrived.  It was just eh.  Food was ok, nothing special and the rest of the meal the same  We were very disappointed"}
{"text":"I am new to the area so I used both Yelp and Yahoo to get idea's on where to take a friend for a birthday dinner.  Arrowhead Grill did not disappoint.  The food was excellent, the service was top and we even had a nice visit from the manager because we were new customers. 

We shared a dessert, if you like butter cake then you will love their butter cake.  It was amazing.   I will absolutely return to one of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"Arrowhead Grill was a great experience. My steak was cooked perfect. I usually order Filet but choose the Delmonico this time since it was their specialty. I dont regret it at all and would order the same thing when I return. 

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the service. It was not bad at by any means but when the prices are at a 5 star level the service was a little slow. Certainly not at the level of Mastro's."}
{"text":"Buyer beware.  Took advantage of the New Years special this evening, (buy one Delmonico steak between 9-10pm and get the second one for free).  Upon explaining to our waiter that we wanted to take advantage of their \"advertised special\" in the AZ Central dining deals from AZ Republic that had been advertised since December 21st on this website,we were informed he was not aware of such special.  Upon which my date and I felt totally embarrassed as I didn't want to look like I was just trying to get something for nothing.  He checked with his manager and said \"they would honor it\", a $28.99 value, but that it was the AZ central error.  From that point on our waiter was very short with us and made us feel like we're putting him out because he wasn't going to make as much in tips from us.  

This couldn't be further from the truth, as all items were alacarte and with wine it actually came out to more than if we had ordered steaks alone.  The steaks by the way were excellent, but the tone for the evening with the poor service didn't make up for the taste and presentation of the food.  By the way, we overheard the couple in the booth behind us request the same special, but by that time the restaurant was aware that people would be comming in for the special.

Finally to make matters worse, when we got bill for the two of us it had an automatic gratuity of 20% added to the bill.  When I explained to the waiter that this must be a mistake he explained that it was \"their policy\" to add on this automatic charge whenever they have to \"give away food\".  When I explained that I didn't feel comfortable in paying such a high mandatory amount, he immediately said he would get the manager and stormed off in a huff.

Manager Eric S. came over and supported his waiter by basically backing him up and not listening to our valid complaints.  He actually stormed off also when we told him we wanted to have him adjust the gratuity to what was a more fair assessment of service at 10-15%.  He came back and gave a half hearted apology for \"feeling threatened\" when I told him I would let others know of their lousy customer service. So there you have it, It appears that their is an attitude at the Arrowhead grill is greater than though, and how dare we to complain.  Needless to say we will not ever be back though the food was good,not worth the hassle and a terrible New Years Eve meal ruined by their ineffective ability to act professional and with grace and understanding."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our 39th wedding anniversary at Arrowhead Grill tonight. The meal and service were fantastic. I had a Kobe beef Delmonico steak, and my wife had the macadamia nut crusted halibut. Both plus the sides were excellent. The service and attention to detail was great. They even offered us two flutes of champagne and a butter cake to share for dessert no charge, plus a card and gift card ! This is not our first visit. I have never been disappointed with Arrowhead Grill."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here three times and haven't once been disappointed! The steak and seafood are amazing and I think about the lobster mac n cheese too often. Such good food!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is great. Lamb chop fondue with truffle cream sauce is out of this world. Filet mignonette sliders were amazing."}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere, and food.  Parking is a slight issue with all the other businesses around if you go around peak hours, but definitely worth it.   A little on the pricey side but you get what you pay for.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Just went here for the second time last week and we had a great time. Friends ordered the steak and said it was delicious.  You have to order the artichoke appetizer and the cheese plate - both were outstanding! I also had a few Moscow Mules and they were well made. 

So I took away one star because they made a few minor mistakes during our meal (not the waiters fault), the wine list although extensive left my friend (a wine connoisseur) underwhelmed, and they don't have even one vegetarian meal on the menu.. I even had to modify the salad to eat that. They have a vegetable risotto that I would've loved to have eaten but it's made with chicken stock - it seems like a big miss when that could easily be made with veggie stock.  

So AG if you're reading this, get on the ball! No one likes eating a bunch of sides for dinner!"}
{"text":"Don't bother with the pretzel app. The cheese sauce might as well have been Velveta with mustard. As for service, you might say that it would be par to an stuffy English restaurant, meaning, slower than molasses and the manager is haughty with no ounce of hospitality. Side of broccoli was 5.99, which we asked if we can have it substituted for the fries to the side for the prime rib sandwich. They failed to inform us before we got the bill. The waiter explained and we agreed to a misunderstanding, then the manager decided, rather than to come by and apologize for the misunderstanding and that it would be taken off immediately, he more so gave us a warning. Saying that we do not make substitutions and that this one time that they would make the concession. FYI, the prime rib sandwich lacked flavor and the bread was bland, did not compliment at all. The horseradish was salty au jus needs a bit more flavor. Try Houstons.

As for the kitchen staff, they apparently don't work for the customers, because when a customer calls for them because the customer is having trouble getting the attention of the waitstaff members they could careless. Wonderful establishment with a great attentive staff."}
{"text":"The Wine Wednesday is fantastic.  1/2 off wines up to $200.  Rock on.  The Delmonico steak is unbelievable.  The chicken is good too - I love the tableside carving."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best. My husband and I enjoy the main dining menu as well as the great happy hour menu.  You can never go wrong at Arrowhead Grill. Outstanding food and Outstanding service.  Love this place."}
{"text":"We've been here twice, both times to celebrate special occasions and we loved it both times.  The prime rib, rib eye,  trio of fries and absolutely the crab cake are all very good.  The martini list is ok, but the Bond martini is excellent and the butter cake dessert is just the kind of decadent diet buster I expect from a steakhouse like this."}
{"text":"I love this place! Both Jessica's are funny and cool. Troy has GREAT hair and a BEAUTIFUL smile. Steve is really funny, like Tom Hanks funny. Mark O has an incredible beard and heart! Marcie has amazing biceps and sweet as sugar soul. The manager Mike is TOP NOTCH. GOD BLESS AMERICA. Get the Delmonico but make sure to ask what it is. This is the best food I've ever had. They also HAD an AMAZING server named Ashley. She is sweet, pretty, funny and VERY good at her job. If you sat her section you were in for a real treat. She will be missed! Also, the butter cake, staff and management are great ."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! I wish the bar area was a little bigger, but it does the job. The staff is great, always very friendly."}
{"text":"Fun place to enjoy the great Happy Hour, but also a great place to celebrate that special occasion. Nancy and I love the food and great servers they employ. This place is highly recommended by us!"}
{"text":"Even with a reservation, we had to wait.  This was our first and last time to this restaurant.  The place was very loud and reminded me of a cafeteria.  Waitress did not tell us that Sunday and Monday night was Prime Rib Special.  We discovered the menu on the table.  We ordered an appetizer and the Prime Rib special which included an additional appetizer.  I specifically asked that all the food not come out all at once.  Of course, it did.  I had to take the cheese platter home in a doggie bag.  The prime rib I ordered was to be medium well.  I received the end cut full of fat and well done.  It was disgusting.  I only ate what was edible.  For $28.99 this was a total rip off.  I cannot say how terrible this place was from the moment we walked in."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour specials, service, and ambiance. The lamb fondue is amazing, and their signature butter cake is to die for."}
{"text":"First time coming here arrived early was seated right away waitress was Polite and very helpful especially in what to order. Food was delicious and  on top of our refills. we ordered a bottle of wine and was able to take home with us.  It's a little pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"The last few times I've been here I do not have a great experience the food is always pretty good but the service can't be happy. Some of the girls have been just amazing. However I've had just a couple of the waiters I have not been very pleasant and don't give you the attentiveness you need or what I expect from an upscale establishment. The manager as always very nice to come by and check on you or your tables. I will be back because experiences do seem to change LOL"}
{"text":"We were just recommend Arrowhead Grill two months ago and we've been there 3 times already. Amazing steak and their Chilean sea bass is some of the best we have had. It can get pricy once you order sides, wine and an ap but it's worth it. Service is great and atmosphere is cozy. Really great pricing on their food and bar menu during happy hour if you sit in bar or on patio."}
{"text":"I don't recall EVER dining with someone who has said, before ordering, \"I wouldn't come back here\".  Why?  Because we choose our dining out experiences carefully.  But one of my dinner companions declared it at Arrowhead last Monday evening, shortly after we ordered our pre-dinner cocktails.

We chose Arrowhead because of the positive Yelp reviews - on which we have relied during our travels throughout the Southwest, West, Southeast, and our own Milwaukee/Chicago area.  I often scan the poor reviews, but disregard if there are an ample number of 4 or 5 stars and elaboration.  I was wrong this time.

Ambiance: The entrance to this upscale steak/seafood restaurant is stunning, but once in the dining room - - - not so much.  The decor was uninteresting, stale, and not intimate.  A table candle (lighting was dim) or a fresh bloom on the table would have gone a long way.  (See posted photo.)  After all, this place advertises itself as \"a new class of neighborhood grill\".

Service:  We waited a long time to order as our waiter seemed to have vanished (finished our wine and had our water glasses filled twice).   Had to ask the busboy to fetch him.  Yes, our steaks and Arctic char were good - but were served without garnish or flair.  A little parsley, lettuce, dill, kale leaf, or WHATEVER would have dressed the big white bare entree plates more like the entrees shown on the Arrowhead website.  Had to wait a bit longer for our side orders so we had time to stare at the starkness of the plates .  When the dishes arrived (Yukon gold mashed potatoes and creamed spinach) they were OK,  but not delicious and seemed as though they had been nuked from a frozen state.  This kind of \"side\" might be OK at home or at a chain eatery, but not at an \"upscale\" restaurant when one is paying extra for everything except for the piece of meat entree order.

Again, the Delmonico steak, New York strip, and Arctic char were delicious, but we chose Arrowhead for a dining EXPERIENCE comparable to other 4/5 star reviewed restaurants that we've visited and enjoyed. This is a pricey restaurant that does not live up to it's potential."}
{"text":"So generally this place is a staple and I have had good things to say to anyone that I talk to about it. However, the last two experiences have been terrible. This time we sat in the bar and basically we were forgotten. We had to flagged down our servers several times just to get anything done and this was after \"happy hour\" when the bar is dead. We will not be coming back and will tell everyone we know that the service has greatly diminished. Not bitter just disappointed."}
{"text":"We made our reservation on Open Table and arrived at our appointed time. We were seated and promptly greeted by our server. She explained the menu as neither of us had been to AG before. We had drinks from the bar, a glass of White Zin and a Martini that really hit the spot but was a bit pricey at $13 a pop for Grey Goose. We shared the Calamari which had a nice bite to it and the Calamari was perfectly cooked. For our entree we had the 8oz New York, medium rare and the 15oz Prime Rib medium rare, shared a Baked Potato side and an Asparagus side. Everything was exactly as ordered and delicious. For dessert we shared the Butter Cake that we devoured along with an espresso. This is a neighborhood gem with a good bar area, subdued lighting, great service and great food. A bit pricey but overall very nice. Whenever you can visit a restaurant and can truly say each part from food to service was well done and produced no negatives, you have found a gem."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of the valley!! Fantastic all around .. Their prosciutto wrapped asparagus is to die for!!! Butter cake desert is something everyone has to
Have!"}
{"text":"Service and food top notch. Atmosphere was great and just a solid upper tier restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and sat outside on the patio. The prices and the food were very good! Our server was great, she even went to talk to the kitchen to get a substitution for me. FYI- if you don't want the mustard/goat cheese dipping sauce that comes with the pretzel fondue you can get the mac and cheese sauce or the au gratin sauce instead.  It was greatly appreciated. We would return, probably for happy hour again."}
{"text":"This place is crazy expensive but the food is only decent. My husband took me there for dinner for my birthday and it was recommended over Flemmings by some friends. The menu was overwhelming and the meats do not come with sides. Those are extra. I ordered the prime rib and my husband ordered the filet. The sides we ordered were Proscuitto WrappedAsparagus for $17.99 (didn't know that was the price for them lol) and mashed potatoes. The asparagus had a lot of flavor that it almost took away from our main course. My husband told the server it was my birthday and he sent over chocolate cake with a pretty design on it. But we paid for that too lol. Overall, I wouldn't have picked this place to go but it was a great birthday dinner date. Glad we tried it, I would recommend to save up before you go there. JK. Lol."}
{"text":"What a find and in my own backyard! Awesome. If you are ever around 83rd Avenue and the 101 in Glendale, Arrowhead Grill is the place to be for a night out with that special someone or hanging out with your friends for some drinks and GREAT FOOD (Awesome Happy Hour)


Known for some of the best steaks in the Valley, you can't go wrong with anything on the Arrowhead Grill menu. Check out their Steak Delmonico, just one of their many specialties, or the 22 oz Bone-In Rib-Eye steak. You won't be disappointed. To top it off try it Oscar Style (a must), the best I've had!  Best service in AZ!"}
{"text":"When Arrowhead Grill came up as next on my list of places to review, the first thought that crossed my mind was \"I need to give this place another shot\". So, here is my first impression of Arrowhead Grill: Great place if they STEP UP the service. 

I visited AG with a friend during restaurant week. The restaurant had just opened up and servers were still setting up here and there. We were seated immediately and we waited to be greeted...and waited. Finally, our waiter made his way over to our table. Here's my thing, when you open your doors for business, you should be ready for business, ready for customers. You could tell he was unprepared to help us out. 

What about the food? Fantastic. I thought the food was great! I started with Hog Island Kumamoto Oysters. They were small, fresh, and sweet oysters. No funky smell or taste, totally fresh and delightful. 
For my entree I had the 10 oz Delmonico Steak, rare of course! What a great slab of beef! I sent my compliments to the chef. The steak was cooked beautifully and seasoned perfectly. On the side, I had the Yukon gold mashed potatoes which were delicious! 

I was full of meat and potato goodness but we had dessert coming! I chose the creme brulee which was perfect consistency and finished table side which was a nice touch! So in between courses, our waiter would vanish. The restaurant wasn't packed at all,so I can only guess he was still doing set up work, but that left my drink empty on too many occasions and me needing a set of silverware. I was annoyed, unfortunately.

I will certainly give Arrowhead Grill another shot. The food was very good. Hopefully the quality of service will match the food on my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to celebrate special events. My husband and I have been to many steakhouses over the years and this one tops all the others. The service is great and the food is AMAZING. It's a secret gem hidden on the west side."}
{"text":"these guys know now to due steaks been hare a few time they are the top 3 steaks I have ever had priced just right for this caliber all the side are awesome and they have like 10 to choose from the service is hit or mis to night was a grate defenley my favorite place for steak"}
{"text":"Just got back from AG and literally had the worst dining experience ever. We were seated at the table basically in the lobby which I should have known right from there that it was going to be a crappy experience. Sat there for 10 minutes with no menu, no drinks, no waiter, no silverware, no service. Eventually the manager comes over and takes our drink order. Comes back with our drinks and takes our order 5 minutes later. Then we wait for our food, and wait some more, and wait some more. Eventually the hostess sees that we have been sitting their for an extended period of time (if I were to venture a guess I would say at minimum 20 minutes with no one coming over to us) with no one coming over to our table and shes asks if we have been helped. We tell her sort of by the manager so she goes to find him. He comes back and gives us a lame excuse about how the kitchen is backed up and all I can think to myself is, \"funny, the women sitting right next to us ordered after we did and they have been eating for 10 minutes already. So food gets there, mine is lukewarm and my wife says hers is cold. We had to ask for silverware and napkins as they still have not been given to us at this point. The BBQ burger I ordered didn't come with the barbeque sauce on it. The fries they served us were also slightly warm and soggy. At this point we never saw the manager again and we had waiter by committee. No one seemed designated to our area so who ever happened to be there was the person helping us. Not sure why but we decided to order dessert which was unimpressive as well. We had the tres leches creme brulee which I'm pretty sure was nothing more than pudding with sugar on top. So we finish the desert and by this point the night has been ruined. I'm frustrated beyond belief and just want to pay and get out of there but of course no one is around to give us our check! We continue to wait until I get fed up and just tell the hostess if she can get someone to give us our check. We pay and leave. It was pretty apparent by the women sitting next to us that we were just blatantly forgotten. For a place claiming to be \"upscale\" this was anything but and if I'm going to spend that type of money I may as well go to a Flemings or Ruth Chris. I guess the moral of the story is if they try to seat you at the table almost in the lobby you're better off just waiting for something else. I for sure will be hard pressed to ever come back and its a damn shame b/c it seems like a nice enough place."}
{"text":"5  The food was really amazing very busy here for a Thursday night. Steak loaded bake potatoes, spinach salad finished off with butter cake yummy.  Happy Anniversary to us!"}
{"text":"First time here. Was alone tonight. Sat at the bar and got happy hour food.  This is not your average pub grub. I got the prime rib sandwich and a glass of the house cab. It's really, really good. Service was great and atmosphere was inviting. 

The bartender / server was Casey. He did a great job. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in all of Arizona. The lamb chop fondue, spinach salad, Delmonico steak, green chile mac n cheese, and butter cake are out of this world! Everything about this place is perfection and the customer service is impeccable. We drive 45 minutes just to eat here!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour food, lots of choices, drinks are good but not cheap. You can not go wrong on the west side with this choice of restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my husbands favorite steakhouse! We've been to all the others in the Phoenix Metro Area, and hands down this is the best place to get a terrific steak! They even have the American Kobe on the regular menu ( hubby's fav). For those of us who don't care for steaks, they have a very nice fish selection, too. I think they have chicken as well, double check the menu. The wait staff is friendly and very professional. 

A lot of people come here for special occasions, and business dinners, but you don't have to come formal, it's a very laid back atmosphere here. Even my Grandchildren want to have their birthday dinners here! 

Try them out on Winedown Wednesdays, they have specials on certain wines. They usually have a wine dinner once a month. I believe they also have a Sunday special."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for \"Wino Wednesday\"... And it was delici! The Scallops were good. The steaks were some of the best slices of meat I've had! A little pricey! 2 of us ate for $100. Skip the veggie risotto! It tasted like rice a roni!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! My parents and I went for happy hour tonight. The food was amazing and the prices were very reasonable! I had a great dirty martini with blue cheese olives. We all shared the Filet Sliders, Crab Cake Sliders, Pig Wings and Iceberg Salad. Each was delicious, but dessert (Butter Cake) was somehow even better! Our servers were Jerry and Troy, they were wonderful, and so were all of the others that took care of us. We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Entering the building they had some really tasty butter bread samples at the counter. My hopes were high. Sat down and asked what their well vodka was, they told me Barton's...could you choose anything cheaper? We're at a place that is serving $40-$50 steaks for crying out loud =| ordered a New York strip medium. It came out probably below medium-rare. Not a huge deal, shit happens. But the steak overall was what I get from Black Angus or Texas Roadhouse. It was fairly tough and not tender like other steaks I get in the same price range. Customer service was good. Manager apologized, and they offered a dessert. They tried to make right of the undercooked meat.  I didn't complain about the steak quality because, well, I'm not sure why actually. The second they told me Barton's was their well vodka,  I knew then I probably wasn't going to be pleased, so you could say it's my fault for staying.

If this wasn't such an expensive place I would have given them 3 stars. But for an upscale restaurant I expect upscale products."}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious. We ordered: crab cakes and  lamb chops fondue for appetizers which if you are into lamb this is the place for you! The fondue is a wonderful combination of meat and cheese.  Dinner we order rack of lamb, AG domin steak, lobster mash potatoes. The rack of lamb melts in your mouth, the steak is served sizzling & has a great seasoning, the lobster mashed potatoes are very tasty!  It was my mothers birthday so they served her their house butter cake which is to die for and taste like a snicker doodles in your mouth."}
{"text":"Although the food was good,  the service was terrible. I love to go to fine dining establishments, and this did not compare. We ordered our drinks and they took at least 10 minutes to get to us.  Then,  our food was lukewarm except for the filet. By the time I wanted another cocktail, I was already finished with dinner.  The check was left at our table,  we paid,  and the server came back to grab the check with his tip, and did not see if we needed anything else. He did not clean off the table or nothing.  You would think they would offer coffee, clean the table off, or something, but no. He grabbed his tip and bailed. Hopefully our server was just having a bad night, but I'm not sure we'll go back."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  Every aspect of Arrowhead Grill exudes excellence.  From the staff to the atmosphere to (especially!) the food... It is easy to witness the incredible high level of passion and commitment Arrowhead Grill holds to.  Bravo.  You've made me a Raving Fan."}
{"text":"Excellent service and quality food
Pictures do not do the taste justice 
Rather pricey but well worth it
Not crowded for a Tuesday night
Wait staff was excellent and professional 
Nice to have this quality on the west side of the valley"}
{"text":"By far, the best meal I've had since moving to Phoenix! The happy hour food deals are incredible! Great wine selection and fun, upscale bar scene. The deviled eggs were awesome."}
{"text":"I was there the other day and enjoyed it.  The service was excellent , the staff was very nice.  The food, for the most part, was very good.  Companion had the prime rib that he raved about it. I had no complaints except one.   All the dishes we ordered were excellent with the exception of the scalloped potatoes.  Maybe because it was busy but this was pathetic. Thick slices of boiled potato thrown in a pan with melted cheese on top   Thats it.  Any 12-year-old could've sliced up a potato thrown a bunch of cheese on top and put it in the oven. Not only that but they were hard as a rock is if they weren't even boiled that well before hand.   With the reputation this restaurant has  and how great food it is to be served a slab of potatoes with melted cheese on top was real strange. I didn't know whether to laugh or be insulted. However everything else was good so I didnt make a big stink out of it I'll just know next time.    I do want to add with the prices this place charges everything and I mean everything should be perfect.     I guess it was worth it as a treat"}
{"text":"Best waiter and manager is Charles and the kids Mac and cheese is amazing the service and food."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Peoria. Go here if you're looking to get a top quality meal without driving to Scottsdale. Steaks are amazing. It is the same as Preston's in Scottsdale since they are under same ownership. Preston's is one of my favorites in the valley and so is Arrowhead."}
{"text":"Had dinner there the 1st time.  Love loved the food. The service was excellent. Best steak in Phoenix.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Sorry, this place was 9 on a scale of 10 until our checks arrived and then it really SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and became a 0 on a scale of 10!

We came during restaurant week (May 21, 2011) and all I can say is that this was the most disappointing dinner out in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area we've had in the past 5 years! Went there for restaurant week to have advertised 3-course meal for $30.00 per person.

The food was pretty good and the atmosphere and service was also pretty good...then came the check! I had a the Braised Short Rib with Creamed Spinach and Strawberry/Chocolate Fondue with a Margarita.
My wife had the Hawaiian Sunfish and Buttercake Desert with 2 Glasses of (supposed HOUSE) Chardonnay. When our check arrived for my wife and I, it came to a total of $126.40!...for 2 $30.00 per person dinners. They automatically included a 20% gratuity and charged $30.00 for the 2 glasses of wine my wife had. It seems they fail to tell their customers (when you ask for a House Chardonnay wine) that they are pushing glasses of Cakebread Chardonnay wine (which they claimed was a $100.00 bottled wine!) @ $15.00 a glass! The red wine our 2 friends had was charged on the bill @ $20.50 a glass. We naturally assumed when we asked for a House glass of red/white wines that we weren't going to be served some expensive restaurant pushed wine. They never showed the bottles we were supposedly served from and for all I know they were $3.40/bottles of wine.

Asked to speak with the manager and he was typically apologetic and offered nothing exept removing the automatic 20% gratuity from the check.

There was nothing on the Arrowhead Grill's listing on OpenTable.com about automatic gratuitys on the checks nor that their supposed house wines are top-of-the shelf...supposedly!

THIS IS ONE RESTAURANT EVERYONE IN THE PHOENIX METRO AREA CAN CERTAINLY AFFORD TO PASS UP! Need I say more? $126.40!...for 2 $30.00 per person dinners and 3 drinks? You gotta' be kidding me!

p.s. Forgot to mention that the Braised Short rib dinner was one really short, short rib about 3 1/2 inches long and consisted of about 4 mouthfulls!"}
{"text":"Amazing place, definitely worth the price, your lady will be impress with this. My waiter Clarence was great and really took care of me and date.. Sea bass and salmon with Louisiana bbq shrimp are something to check out as well..."}
{"text":"Was here with the family. Our first visit, the food was incredible. At first when we walked in they asked us where we would like to sit and I didn't know there is a main dining room choice and by the bar choice. I told them not sure we are really hungry... lol

The hostess sat us at the bar, there are tables there, which surprised me because we had 2 kids with us. But then I went to wash my hands in the restroom and you had to walk through the main dining room to get there, I realized we werent really dressed \"semi formal\" maybe that's why the sat us by the bar. I mean we were coming from the zoo with 2 kids trying to grab a bite. 

I am giving them 5 stars because everything we tried was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Overall a great place. I had the Delmonico steak. Best flavor of steak I have had in a long time. Crab cakes were good but not amazing. I am judging on taste and quality versus price mind you. For the price I would have expected jumbo lump crab in the cakes. The sauce/relish/salsa on top was very tasty. Pretzel fondue is great and worth trying. Suddenly everyone has pretzel fondue on their menus or pretzel buns with their sandwiches. We did go on one of their 2 for 1 steak nights. Great deal for a good steakhouse. Not so good are their tip policies on that. I understand tipping on what the meal should have cost etc. But I am not a fan of a 20% gratuity being added to a bill just because a deal/coupon is used. What if the service was bad? There was a small issue also with a bottle of wine that was out of stock. They substituted a slightly more expensive(10 dollars maybe) bottle at the cost of the other bottle. Great. But then the server added the cost of the higher priced wine to the overall bill and subtracted the 10 dollars later. This in effect added to his guaranteed 20% tip. Very shady server practice."}
{"text":"Just had a great steak and wonderful dinner at the Arrowhead Grill on Sunday January 28th. We had a reservation and were seated promptly and greeted with great customer service. We have had dinner there before and are never disappointed. However, another restaurant at the opposite side of the complex was having a car show that day and we could not find a parking spot anywhere. We had to literally park over a block away from the restaurant and navigate the heavy traffic on Union Hills Drive. The staff at the restaurant apologized for the inconvenience but did not have any control over what the other business planned. My only suggestion is that the Arrowhead Grill should look into the available limited parking situation. If parking continues to be a problem then even with a reservation the great food and customer service we will need to look somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Great service. Great cuts of meat. Everything is ala carte style. Good bar food specials. Place can be quite crowded."}
{"text":"Went to meet friends at Arrowhead as it was 1/2 way between where we were staying and where they were staying. We had a party of 9. Food and service was exceptional! I had the Delmonico and it was one of the best steaks I have ever had. Everyone raved about their meals. They brought us Buttercake to share for dessert and it was outstanding. Not cheap but for a special meal, I would highly recommend Arrowhead Grill."}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse in Phoenix. We usually only eat in the dining room during restaurant week or for special occasions.  The sweet potatoes are amazing. However, the happy hour is very reasonably priced. It has become one of my favorite places to go. I love the prime rib sandwich and the green bean fries. The mules are very tasty as well. No meal in dining room or bar is complete without the gooey butter cake. So good."}
{"text":"Some of the best cuts of MEAT in town! And the butter cake is the main reason to go there for. And the hidden bar menu burger is the best!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was quite the surprise. Coming from a small plaza in Arrowhead, i wasn't expecting such a wonderful experience. The food cannot be explained, it simply needs to be tasted by everyone. The server was friendly and knew the menu inside and out. The manager was friendly and a wine expertise. This is with out a doubt, the best restaurant to hit peoria/glendale.  It's worth the trip from any part of town."}
{"text":"Is the AG Burger the best in town?? Maybe, if you know one that can top it let me know!!
Ground tenderloin tips, fried onions and sliced prime rib!!  Or try the AG Salmon with BBQ shrimp. The west side needs more local places like this with great food. Grab a seat in the bar and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"To begin, it was rather pricey for the atmosphere. There should be tablecloths on the tables and the servers should be in nicer uniforms. My salad was nothing more than chopped iceberg lettuce, shredded carrots, onions and 4 very small olives. The steaks were excellent but very expensive. The sides was ok. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not sure where to actually start...my wife and I have thought about going to AG for years, but the location wasn't where we would normally find a great eatery.  Tonight we went there and celebrated my wife's birthday and it was amazing.  Our waiter, Jerry, was perfect and knowledgeable while being honest about the food and wines.  We started with the appetizer special, roasted artichoke.  My wife and I have tried hundreds of restaurants artichokes and have labeled this one to be the best of all time.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned to where you didn't need to dip it in the butter that was provided over an open flame.  Then we shared the AG Salad.  This field greens came topped with fig, goat cheese, and candied pecans lightly tossed in a sweetened dressing that included a small dash of mustard.  For our main course we both chose the filets.  Her's was traditionally cooked to perfection while mine was Oscar Style and also cooked perfectly.  We shared the lobster mashed potatoes (every bite had lobster -7 ounces in total).  To compliment this meal, we shared a bottle of The Riddler Lot 6 (Napa blend).  Since this was a celebration, Jerry served up their warm Butter Cake topped with Vanilla Bean ice cream along with a small gift. 
From the great service, awesome food, and overall ambiance, I place Arrowhead Grill into my Top 25 list of places to eat.  Only drawback is it may be to close to my house for me to stay away."}
{"text":"Very impressed. Great and tentative customer service, great knowledge from servers of the menu, very nice ambiance and setting. Fancy, but not fancy, if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Happy hour menu has generous portions of creative and perfectly cooked and served foods. I was surprised by Wine Down Wednesday half price bottles under $106. 

Christine, our server, clearly enjoys customers and the menu. 

My favorite: lamb chops with truffle tremor fondue!!!

I understand you have to get there early even for the bar, so be prepared if you arrive much after they open"}
{"text":"Perfect place. I recommend the shrimp cocktail as they are huge. My partner enjoyed the oysters. The steaks are cooked perfect and tender. Lobster mashers are tasty. Desserts are wonderful. The decor is very soothing and the staff efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Dinner for 3 adults this past Saturday.

Service was awesome from Ashley. The room was comfortable and the ambiance was nice.

My only complaint was the food was not exceptional for the price. My brother ordered prime rib and was satisfied. My sister-in-law ordered filet mignon and was satisfied. I ordered Chilean sea bass and was not at all impresses. It was dry and flavorless, which is too bad considering it was the most expensive entree.

Whatever you order as your protein arrives totally alone on a plate..... so for example my sea bass was $38.99 + artisan mac & cheese $15.99 = $55.00, then add a veg $12.99 and you're at $68.00.......

We ordered sides that were described to be family style and they were OK... not great. Brussel sprouts were crunchy, asparagus was overlooked and way too salty, mac and cheese was beyond cooked and too salty.  Also the portions were too small to be called family style. Most were enough for one hungry person, maybe two.

Three people $350 for mediocre food - not so great.  Three people $350 for awesome food would have been great.

Next....."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight. Was taken very well care of even though I was a single. Food was excellent, though prices and portions were fairly large. My leftovers will be my lunch tomorrow. Service and atmosphere were top knotch. My red wine originally arrived too cold. I told them about it and they offered to replace it. Not knowing what the next one would be like I passed. But then a few minutes later a new, room tempeture glass arrived, and I took it, The temparture was perfect, as was the steak and the asparagus. Good meal."}
{"text":"This is the greatest place to get steaks in the west valley for sure! Their Delmonico steak is to die for. The food is excellent and the service is great. They also have an awesome wine list."}
{"text":"Went with 2 friends from out of town was 6pm on a Sunday night.Had a great waiter, but the food was Very sub par.....3 of us ordered prime rib special 39.99 were we had  to pick sides from special menu ..
The Prime rib was very fatty an came to plate barely warm. Had no crunchy crust wasnt tender.. I Ordered onion rings came as tower, they weren't freshly fried was mushy an warm at best, knew they were under heat light...Friend said mac an cheese was terrible. My other friend had Swordfish said it was just ok....2 Stars review at best once as great waiter ...."}
{"text":"Have excellent happy hour menu and food. Pretzel with dipping sauce is great.  Wedge salad and fillets are very good as well. We have never had a bad meal and the service is excellent too. It's pricey but worth it, one of the finer steak and seafood places in North Phoenix Area."}
{"text":"Amazing food we love this place, we always get a filet mignon. We have tried swordfish that was delicious as well, have to have the loaded mashed potatoes with our meals. We come once every 6 months, its worth it!"}
{"text":"The manager, Derek took my pitcher of water off my table that I specifically requested. When I asked him to leave it, he took it anyway. I found it rude and unaccommadating. We have here 10 times within the year with no issues until now. Our server and buser were great though  Derek said he will make sure he keeps up on filling the water. If does, then I will change it to five stars. Trying to give him the benefit of the doubt, since this place has always been good to us.Derek took the time to explain why and I was very satisfied you took the time and explain to us and it made perfect sense thank you Derek was nice meeting you thanks for a great nighti've been here about 15 times and I keep coming back for reason"}
{"text":"I was just reading reviews of Arrowhead Grill and really confused.  I think since the food is pretty good, the reviews follow.  However, if service is of any consequence, this place deserves only one star, if that.  

I have been there many times, mainly because some friends are friends of the management and love to go there and because there aren't very many upscale establishments in the area, especially since SKYE closed.

We would always sit in the bar area and maybe the dinning room is different, but every time I have been there the service was very poor.  Every time you wanted a drink you had to flag someone down or go hunt your server down.  This was a constant battle EVERY time I have been there.  I have complained to management several times but they always make excuses and do nothing.  

I think most of the good reviews are people who like the food and just put up with the slow service."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and people!  Each person we encountered was attentive and friendly, especially our waitress, Marcie.  I had the Del Monico steak which is with their signature seasoning. Sliced like butter, savory in the mouth pleasing each and every taste bud.  The side of broccoli was also delicious and well seasoned. We also shared a wedge salad with the most delicious bacon on it and a baked potato with all the toppings.  The sides are big enough to share.  So are the steaks. However, we each got our own steak with my husband getting the porterhouse.  He's quite the meat lover and by his smile, I know he thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's Wednesday which meant it was \"wine down Wednesday\" offering bottles of wine at half off.  There are a lot sauce toppings available for the steaks which we both tried.  Although the toppings were great, I liked the steak just as it was without. Obviously we recommend this great restaurant!"}
{"text":"We came during restaurant week and all I can say that this was the best clam chowder I have ever had!  They did not skimp on the seafood that is for sure and the way that it is served is super cute with the cast iron thing with a tea light candle under.  

I had the hawaiian sunfish and my dinner dates and the filet wrapped in bacon.  I really liked the sunfish- I had it with the spices on top and it was just the right about of kick for me.  I tried a bite of the filet and felt that it was a bit salty due to the bacon...but other than that it was pretty good.  I don't know if I would come back to pay the regular price, but this place is definitely worth a try for restaurant week. 

They also had some pretty tasty desserts!  I had the strawberry fondue...but there was a moment I felt that the strawberries may not have been washed...oh well- I still ate it. The brownie fudge thing was also really good and super great for chocolate lovers!"}
{"text":"Over the course of the last couple years, I frequently ate at the Arrowhead Grill and have never had a bad meal here. All of their food is delicious and is very accommodating to vegeterians. On top of that, the deserts are to die for! Easily my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix Area."}
{"text":"Had an amazing evening last night at Arrowhead Grill.  Our server was Troy who had a very witty sense of humor and did an amazing job.  Thank you Troy for putting up with us!  The whole staff treated my guest and I very well.  Dinner was absolutely divine, compliments to the chef and kitchen staff!  This was my first time at Arrowhead Grill and we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Central Girl goes West
I have a friend who lives in the west valley and always is driving into town.  So when we decided to have dinner tonite--thought I would go west instead and boy was the trip worth it.

We had dinner at Arrowhead Grill.  This place hits the right note on just about everything--very casual, tables aren't on top of each other and service is very well paced and not intrusive--but after all that it really comes down to the food

My friend had the Delmonico steak and I had the special which was an arctic fish--we also shared a chopped  salad, green chile mac and cheese and asparagus--

Everything was done just right--the steak and fish were excellent, the mac and cheese had just enough green chile but not too much to over power it.  even the asparagus was terrific--crunchy and tender at the same time.

we did save room for dessert and ordered the butter cake topped with vanilla been ice cream and chocolate swirl--the cake had a fabulous taste and texture--decaf coffee was a great complement to it.

i will definitely go back-especially now that I know where it is.  If it is your first time and it is at night it will take a minute to find--because there is no lit signage (at least there wasn't tonite)  just follow the cars

Arrowhead Grill is definitely worth a trip west."}
{"text":"Great service from Clarence and Kasey.  Cocktails were large and well made but overpriced.  Clam chowder and shrimp cocktail were very good. Our filets were very nice, however the house spice mix left them extremely salty. 

All in, this is a very nice, and very expensive steakhouse experience. Not sure we'll return for the $$$$ value.  :-("}
{"text":"Besides trying to find parking here the food and service are out standing.  We started with the grilled artichoke as an appetizer and it was delicious.  I ordered the Arctic Char which was delicious but a very small portion for $32.  My husband had the rack of lamb which was cooked and seasoned wonderfully and we splurged on the lobster mashed potatoes.  Ended our evening with a delicious flourless chocolate cake.  Did I mention half price bottles of wine in Wednesday."}
{"text":"Disappointed lately with the service - been there twice within the past month, once for happy hour and once for dinner in the dining area.

Mostly notably out of the two instances -a server named Mark was pretty snappy and argumentative with me the other night when I requested the bar menu at the dining tables. I've always requested and never gotten any push back. Not looking for HH pricing, just the salad that isn't on the regular menu. It's also the only way I'm able to order everything I like (app, dinner and dessert) because it's so much food. Wasn't going to make a scene with the group I was with, so I gave up. 

Food is good...it's become our usual place to go, but given the lackluster service lately we'll probably take our group nights to one of the few other places we've been wanting to try."}
{"text":"The last couple times we have came the food has gradually been worse.  This last particular time I ordered a bone in rib eye medium and it came out almost well done.  The meat wasn't as good tasting and the bone was a tiny shank that didnt go thru the entire meat as usual.  

My wife ordered the large order of crab legs and the meat was overcooked and tough. Very disappointing all around.

We ordered popcorn shrimp for my son and they were also rather pathetic.  What you would expect from frozen Gordons and not a higher end steak house.

The trio of fries was good as was the creamed spinach, seasonal salad, and bread.  Our waitress was also very nice and sweet as were the other helping staff and hostesses.

I never really paid attention to the interior because the food was so good but this time I was looking around more than looking at my plate and for the money it feels rather cheap inside.  Very plain decor and furniture.

I have to say for the food and ambiance versus the cost AG just isn't worth it anymore.  It is very unfortunate because we really enjoyed coming here and there are almost zero spots worth dining at within a good distance from here.  

Hopefully they turn the food back around to how it was before.  We most likely won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good but not excellent. Overpriced for the quality. Service was great but the food was lacking a bit. Cocktail menu could be expanded and the steak was tougher than it should have been. Salmon was good but not cooked to perfection. Shrimp cocktail sauce had wayyyy too much horseradish but the lobster mashed potatoes were amazing! Creme brûlée was good but could be better as well. The tableside torch was a nice touch though."}
{"text":"Place was packed for happy hour as usual. Find a place at the bar it was half price bottles of wine on Wednesday. What a deal!  Had the usual BLT deviled eggs as an app and splurged for the Chilean Sea Bass which was marvelous! My favorite had always been at the Ocean Club but this might have even been better!  Macadamia encrusted and totally succulent it was superb! Service was great and food was top notch!  Best place in the West Valley by far!"}
{"text":"Expensive but totally worth the price! I made my reservation online and was seated right away when we got there in a booth, food was amazing I ate the salmon (which was recommended on the list)"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place! Amazing service and great appetizers and dinner! They were so friendly and attentive to all of our requests."}
{"text":"Had the Kobe steak and French onion soup. Both reminded me of Don Schula's in Florida. Absolutely with the price. The breads that they bring you are of excellent quality and will make you hunger for more if you like breads."}
{"text":"Pros:  Steak was awesome.  The saute green beans is very good.  Great wine list.  We did get a complimentary dessert.  

Cons: Atmosphere more casual than $80 dinner place.  Vinyl on the seats?  A little crowded for upper end.  Service was slow and frankly almost absent for over 20 minutes.  Had to ask for water refill 3x before it happen.  Potatoes were served so hot had to wait for them too cool down.  Was disappointed there was no option to add shrimp or prawns with the steak.

Not sure if I will return.  I want to like it, but I can't try it again until I am ready to spend another $85 and almost 2 hours on dinner."}
{"text":"We love Arrowhead Grill far and away the best steak house in the North West Valley.  Most people do not know about this well kept secret.  While the food was perfect we have had mixed results with service...nothing horrible just a little slow some thimes."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best steak place around! It isn't cheap but great food never is. I hear the happy hour here is awesome. I haven't tried it but a reliable source says it is well worth it. The food is great, service is too notch, and the dessert is unreal. Make it a date night!"}
{"text":"Jerry the bartender was full of energy and made me feel very welcomed. I told him I was visiting for work and to order me their top known drink. He came back with a Vanilla Manhattan that was out of this world. I wish I ordered the steak but I just wasn't in the mood for red meat and instead had to settle for some of the best Lobster Mac n Cheese I could request haha. Eating at the bar, a neighboring couple told me the steak here is better than DelFrisco's and on par with Dominic's. Definitely coming back next time I am in town. And if you have a sweet tooth then GET THE BUTTER CAKE. You won't regret!"}
{"text":"We had just the best time at Arrowhead Grill, a group of us went for happy hour the other day.  It was my anniversary (17 years WOO HOO :) so we decided it was okay to go to a place we didn't have a coupon for LOL!
The bar doesn't have a happy hour menu per se, but you do get some discounts and can order anything you wish off the regular menu too.
We tried the crab cake (just superb), filet sliders, prime rib sandwich, shrimp cocktail, pig wings (roasted mini pork shanks), and chicken tacos.  The tacos had a bit of a fake smokiness added to them and they were the only thing I wouldn't order again.  Good beer and wine selections of course!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars only because of our server, Mark O. He was barely an average server. If we are spending that kind of money, we want to be treated very well ! Another time we went our server was excellent! Mark O is more of an Applebee's waiter. He seemed miserable and barely muttered Happy Anniversary. On the other hand, the food is excellent! The steak, lobster mac n cheese, sweet potatoes and butter cake are to die for !!! Atmosphere & bathroom are average."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Arrowhead Grill for years and should have yelped them a long time ago. Arrowhead Grill is the only true fine dining on the Northwest side of town. Steaks are cooked properly and priced reasonably for the quality level. The Happy Hour menu in the bar is a great value. The Pig Wings (braised pork shanks) are delectable. We also like the crab cake sliders. There are only two things that disappoint me. There are no draft beers - everything is in a bottle. The second issue is that they occasionally bring food to the table on a cart. It can be distracting as they wheel this cart through the dining room between the chairs.  It just seems a bit awkward for fine dining. Ditch the cart and add some microbrew on tap to get my fifth star. Otherwise, we truly love Arrowhead Grill. The food, service, and ambiance is top notch."}
{"text":"Extremely tender and tasty dinner. I have been here several times with my husband and have ordered the same steak Delmonico every time. The AG mashed potatoes are amazing and highly recommended. We also had the grilled and charred artichokes that were phenomenal. We usually end dinner with the infamous butter cake. I have no complaints about this place and normally 100 percent satisfied however, we just went there for our anniversary and specifically asked for our booth we have been sitting in each time we go there for years and the hostess refused to sit us there. She instead sat us next to a table of six with a kid and in a high traffic area. She gave me the excuse that they don't have any available servers in the area of our booth.  That was an acceptable excuse until about 2 minutes after she sat us in our booth, we watched her sit the very next couple in the booth we specially asked for. I couldn't believe she lied to us and I'm not sure why she did. Either way the food was good but I didn't appreciate being lied to and for that reason I didn't rate this place 5 stars. Our experience was not as pleasant as it could have been and we had to battle with noise and high traffic walking by us as we ate. Needless to say, the hostess refused any eye contact with us and for the 2 hours we were there and for the $200 bill we paid, we should have been sat in the booth we asked for. I'm sure our waitress where we sat enjoyed her $50 tip for two people. Too bad that other waitress that was serving the area with the other booth doesn't know the hostess lost her tip for her because she refused to sit us in that booth."}
{"text":"Celebrated my mom's 80th birthday here. It was fantastic! Our server, Ashley, took great care of us! The prices are little high, but worth it. The sides are family style and enough for four regular appetites, or 3 for larger appetites. We had the perfectly cooked asparagus and the lobster mashed potatoes. YUM!!! For entrees our party had the Maine lobster tails that were cooked to perfection, as was the halibut and prime rib. Great food and service. I will be back the next time I'm in town. Next time however, I'll dress a bit more casual. Certainly upscale food and service, but it seems the dress code is much more casual. One last thing: save room for the butter cake. Absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Have heard rave reviews about this place, so was super excited to come here. Wasn't hungry what so ever unfortunately, so I settled for a salad. After ordering, appetizer, salad, and my guest as well ordered a salad and soup, we handed our menus back to the waiter. Who then proceeded to say \"really, that's it? Really?\" I'm sorry I didn't order a $75 steak, or $50 lobster tail. Apparently even spending close to $60 on lettuce wasn't good enough. Felt super belittled and wanted to get up & leave after that comment was made. Irregardless of how much food someone orders you're working for a tip based on YOUR ATTITUDE! My bill could be $5, and I'll still tip you $10 if I think you did great. Won't be returning since one server had to ruin it."}
{"text":"Good food! Terrific \"Spicy\" margarita! Stephanie was extremely helpful in menu selections and being attentive. Key lime pie was such a tasty way to end a delicious feast."}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse that I use to frequent. Better than Flemings or Mortons IMO. I took customers and colleagues here whenever I traveled to the area. Big party or just a couple of us the service was always top notch. Shrimp cocktail, french onion soup, filet oscar style, and butter cake were my go-to's every single time."}
{"text":"When we initially viewed this restaurant a comment popped up that was very unkind. We were meeting family for dinner and hoped it was not accurate. Fortunately it was way off the mark!  Our  experience was most enjoyable. Our server, Clarence, was extremely attentive, courteous and friendly. Yes, prices may be high but portions are perfect for sharing. Sides are a la carte but also sufficient for two or more. Our NY Strip steak was cooked to perfection and the most tender I've ever eaten. Everyone in our party was most complimentary of the entire evening."}
{"text":"After a long day of furniture shopping, we were need of some sustenance and relaxation.  Arrowhead Grill fit the bill.  

Be warned as the drinks seems to be on the sweet side.  I asked the waitress if the margarita was really sweet (I think it's cheating if it is - good 'ritas don't need to be so sweet) and she said it wasn't.  It was one of the sweeter margaritas I had and I ended up pawning if off on the husband.  

The coconut shrimp was delicious as was my steak (it's not Ruth's Chris but damn close).  I'd love to come back for the butter cake."}
{"text":"This place is very disappointing. Went out with two other couples. Service was on an Applebee's level, along with the food. For charging only 10 dollars less than Mastro's per entree,the overall quality should be much better. Would Never step foot in this place again."}
{"text":"We found this gem because we were simply hungry after shopping for tile for a home remodel. The online photo of a stack of onion rings is misleading.  This place is wonderful in both the dining room & the bar during Happy Hour. Everything is served family style.  The prime rib bone served during Happy Hour is delicious, as is the pretzel bread & cheese fondue. We love the brussel sprouts!! Everything here is worth the price: the food, the ambience, the service! We've made it our \"go to place\". A definite must try!!"}
{"text":"One of the few nice restaurants in the area. The bar is also a great place for happy hour with girlfriends or a more casual bite to eat. Love the patio since they enclosed it."}
{"text":"There's nothing to say except, it's excellent.! I'm sorry Fleming's, however this place is my new favorite for fine dining, in addition you can enjoy happy hour like no other, but get there early. Another excellent  west side Restaurant! Sea Bass is the best I have had any where, including California. The steaks and side dishes are exceptional. Try the Butter Cake to end the evening!"}
{"text":"We went on Valentines day for dinner. We also went on Valentines day last year. We have been to Arrowhead Grill at least 10 times in the past. Tonight it was just an off night as can happen. We had never had an off experience at Arrowhead Grill so we held the restaurant in high regard. The Steak was overwhelming, over powered and inundated with SALT. It was way beyond anything we ever had at Arrowhead Grill in the past. I do not mean a little on the salty side I mean horrendously salty. The rest of the meal was fine but the steak is the star on the plate and it did not live up to prior visits whatsoever. The service was also really slow. The waiter came by 3 times to tell us just a few more minutes and it was almost 1 hour before food arrived. But that was not the worst of the timing. Dessert took 27 minutes from order to arrival and it was the worst dessert we have had in a long long time. We didn't eat it. We held the Arrowhead Grill to a nearly top tier standard and they did not make it last night. It does diminish our overall opinion but we will still go back"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best steak you can find on the west side of town. The service was wonderful and the food was to die for. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Date night experience, quite pricey so our order was short. I ordered the honey sugar margarita, strong and delicious! We shared the calamari appetizer, the flavor was fulfilling. Really good! My partner ordered the french onion soup, lovely display but it was the saltiest soup we have ever consumed! We appreciate the manager removing the soup from our bill, it just wasn't edible for us. I would like to give this restaurant another go!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love arrowhead grill! Been here many times and it has always been on point as far as food and atmosphere. The reason I'm just commenting now is the last piece of the puzzle came into play tonight... Kimberley gave exceptional service!!! Now when we come back we know who to ask for and I highly recommend you do the same!"}
{"text":"Was going to eat with a friend and got there early. I ordered a margarita at the bar and had a second one too. I did not ask for any special tequila. I got the check and it was almost $34 
I have never heard of a $17 margarita - especially on the west side. 
I will never go back and I suggest you ask prices before you drink anything there. And the margaritas were not anything special nor large."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is going to get a second viewing, but the first was so very good, I had to throw a review up here.

I came here for a bite to eat and a drink after wandering through the Desert Botanical Gardens.  Needless to say I was parched.  A friend tells me that the bar menu is a good deal and she was very very VERY right.

I'm sorry, a $3 halfway decent long island?  Where else do you find that?  Duck quesadillas?  Amazing.  Even their simple cheeseburger sliders were excellent.

Chuck: keep up the good work.  Keep that 100 year old cookbook of magic you brought out safe, and I'll be back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Simply fabulous!  Highly recommend this restaurant. We will be back!  Del Monico steak was fabulous. Brussels sprouts, great service.  Only wish is for linen tablecloths, but really. That's my only suggestion"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for happy hour on a Saturday and even though it was busy we were able to grab a high top in the bar almost immediately. This was such a pleasant surprise because we have tried to go to happy hour in the past and there was an hour wait for the bar. 

My husband and I ordered the AG salad, sweet potato fries, and the green beans. They were all so delicious we finished them in no time. We ordered 3 drinks and called it a night. Our bill was $86.00 not including tip. So yeah... it was expensive but places this nice are not commonly found around that part  of Glendale and it was worth the trip. I rated Arrowhead Grill 4 stars instead of 5 because it is pricey.

Our server was great and very accommodating helping us order exactly what we wanted. 

We can't wait to go back for a special occasion or date night."}
{"text":"Salad 2 stars
Steak 5 stars
Service 4 stars
Vibe 3 stars 
Butter cake 5 stars++++
Yes, it's pricy but I will go back just for that Butter Cake yum! 
Happy Hour is until 6 pm with limited appetizer and drink selections"}
{"text":"The service was very good which is why it gets more than one star, but the food was worse quality than something I could whip up at home in 15 mins.  Ordered a porterhouse oscar style with a side of mac and cheese. Steak was fatty and chewy, very mild seasoning that I could barely taste.  When I'm dropping $60 for a steak I expect the best cut available this was manager special section meat. I'm almost positive the crab cake was the $1 premade version you can buy at the grocery store so fishy and very little to no crab.  Mac and cheese was definitely the refrigerated premade stuff.  Will NEVER be back and will tell me friends to run if they mention this place.  Circling back to the one positive, the wait staff was excellent and the manager was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"This was a chance to spend time with a great customer and everything was excellent.

Thanks for taking such good care of us and making for a very enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"Great food in a not-too-stuffy atmosphere. Moderately priced for steakhouse of that caliber and they offer great specials. I could become a regular!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! What great customer service! 
First timers and did they roll out the red carpet for us! 
Nate the bartender went out of his way to make us feel welcome and made some great and tasteful suggestions on the happy hour menu.
Definitely coming back to try the prime rib and filet I saw going out to other tables."}
{"text":"Food was excellent as well as the service. I am already looking forward to my next meal here."}
{"text":"Always a great place for a happy hour!!  The staff is wonderful and will recommend new wines to try. Love this place. The sirloin sliders are delicious."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. 2nd time here. But extremely annoyed that our server keeps rushing us. Spent almost $200 bucks. Back off Jack."}
{"text":"They still love to slightly overdo their filet. Love them but still slightly on the more cooked side. Order rare plus and let your plate cook it, if you are a die hard medium rare."}
{"text":"Great food great service expensive but you get what you pay for best Prime Rib in valley will go many times again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Went with my hubby for our anniversary last night. Busy night, long wait but we didn't mind too much considering the occassion. The manager apologized, gave us free desert and discounted our meal. They didn't have to, we didn't ask or expect it. I love this restaurant and I really appreciate them for everything. We will be back and continue to recommend the restaurant. The steaks were wonderful as well!"}
{"text":"My first disappointment was the booth they sat us in. They seemed not to know the spring in the first booth was worn out. I sat down and immediately sank. The Hostess noticed but walked away anyway. We ended up switching sides on our own. I would have expected the Hostess to offer another booth. Nonetheless we just went with it. The service was slow.  Our waiter wasn't very attentive.  It seemed to take awhile to get our food. When our order finally arrived, unfortunately my steak was overcooked. They did replace it and the manager did come to apologize. I just expected some sort of compensation. Maybe dessert or a round of drinks. Simply because, if you are promoting yourselves as being known for your Delmonico Steak, the Delmonico steak should exceed my expectations and should have been perfect the first time. On a positive note, the food was piping hot and it tasted amazing. My new steak was perfect and our Agrautin potatoes were delicious.  They just need to make a few improvements to earn 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've dined at every steakhouse in the Phoenix area. Arrowhead Grill is clearly the best, not close. I've never been served a more delicious filet, ever. The service and atmosphere are top notch. I wholeheartedly recommend Arrowhead Grill."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant!  The food is always amazing! Have suggested it to several friends and they all agree. Our new go to place for the best food on  the West side of this city.  No other restaurant can hold a candle to this one.
In addition,  the waiters and waitresses are fabulous; Ronny is great and fun to laugh with. You should ask for her, it will be a great experience for you too!!!"}
{"text":"Went here during Arizona Restaurant Week with my Dad.  What a find!  I'd describe the place as a laid back steakhouse with alot of the usual surf n turf fare.  The waiter was very attentive and responsive to any questions we had.  We had four choices for each course.  For the appetizer he got the Clam Chowder while I got the chopped salad.  Salad was alot bigger than I had imagined, but good.  My Dad was enamored with the chowder.  For the appetizer, I got the 12 oz short rib while my Dad got the 8 oz bacon wrapped filet.  We split each dish.  The filet was cooked to a nice medium rare and bacon added terrific flavor.  The short rib was fall off the bone tender and flavorful.  For the dessert, he got the small chocolate fondue bowl while I got the Ghirardeli chocolate brownie.  Both were outstanding as the fondue chocolate was rich and velvety while the brownie was filled with the right balance of chocolate and caramel and topped with chocolate ice cream.  Each dish had elegant presentation and we didn't have to wait long for each at all.  

It goes without saying that its hard to find alot of Scottsdale-worthy fine dining experiences on the west side of town.  Other than Flemings and Melting Pot, you won't find another fine dining experience in the West Valley than this place.  Both my Dad and I were very pleasantly surprised by the character and the quality of this place.  I especially recommend this place if you're looking for a spot to try out during Arizona Restaurant Week"}
{"text":"Wow, what an amazing experience.  We celebrated our anniversary there.  The food was to die for.  The best Chilean Sea Bass I've ever had, you had to order it.  They treated us to well and even delivered a butter cake to celebrate.  Well worth the visit, even for the price."}
{"text":"Great service, food & drinks.  We had the spinach salad with steak which was perfect size along with a drink. The chocolate chip skillet cookie with ice cream was perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I sat at the bar and throughly enjoyed the mixed grilled seafood appetizer. The service, ambiance and food was impeccable and we are looking forward to coming back. We highly recommend this restaurant for foodies who enjoyed great food, great drinks and exceptional service. We will definitely will be back...and soon!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant on the west side!!! Friendly staff and great customer service! My favorite thing to get is the Delmonico OSCAR style! My mouth is watering talking about it...."}
{"text":"AG always offers a great dining experience and once again that was the case. Steaks are amazing but the Sea Bass is my wifes go-to dinner there."}
{"text":"Casey. Best tender in town. Glad he's back. The pretzels are amazing. Try the tomahawk!! It's worth every penny of the $70. Hubs and I split it. We love that there is a fine dining place on the west side. Great happy hour."}
{"text":"Expensive....expensive...expensive. What more can I say? There are limited food options - steak, fish and more steak. So if you want an entree that is a chicken or duck breast with a nice sauce or if you are in the mood for ribs or even shrimp with fettucini forget it, you are not getting it here. This is a casual and yet very expensive steakhouse. Good for those who can't cook a steak for themselves or who are on an expense account with no limits.

Were the steaks good, yes. Were the sides tasty, yes. Was the complimentary bread fresh, yes. But the place was packed and it took nearly 15 minutes to get a server to approach us and well the quality and service was just not good enough to overcome the really high prices for what are some of the easiest entrees and sides to make for yourself at home.

Sides were $8.99 and up for a moderately small, sometimes really small (mashed spuds) portion. The steaks started - yes started at $32.99 and went up to nosebleed prices from there. No tablecloths, tight seating and well the atmosphere was like a big huge dining hall albeit with dark wood."}
{"text":"We are forever customers of AG! Their wine selection is spectacular and always a perfect match for their fantastic filet. Try the calamari as a starter, you won't regret it!! Yum!"}
{"text":"The service was great with any server walking by giving you attention and asking if there was anything you needed. My overall issue was with the food. While it was good, i did not feel like it lived up to high praise it was receiving. I got the Prime Rib dinner. Got the clam Chowder soup to start which was average nothing special, the Prime Rib itself was juicy and easy to cut got i medium rare, but the taste was very bland and somewhat cold as well. There didn't seem to be much too it. Did not seem to be worth the price payed. We also got the baked potato which was fully loaded and again nothing special. the mac and cheese was also pretty average. i guess my overall problem was that everything just tasted ok rather then spectacular as some reviews have stated. There did not seem to be anything special, at least not the type of food that would keep me coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for Valentine's Day. I don't think I've ever had a better experience at a steak place. I'm sad that I can't remember our waitress's name because she was fantastic. She was so friendly and knowledgable about everything, it was such a pleasant experience. Not to mention the food was amazing!!!! I ordered the filet mignon, and my boyfriend ordered the prime rib. Both cooked to absolute perfection. We also ordered sides of lobster mac and cheese and lobster mashed potatoes. Phenomenal!!! Amazing flavor in every bite. For dessert we ordered cheesecake with strawberry glaze...melt in your mouth deliciousness. To top off our night, my boyfriend inquired about their Louis XIII cognac, our waitress promptly retrieved the manager to give us the details of the cognac. The drink cost $71 for a half ounce....but we tried it anyways. Overall, I can't say enough good things about this place. Try it and you'll see."}
{"text":"We have had the fish and steaks here, and they are uniformly excellent. Their house Delmonico Steak melts in your mouth, and the sauce they use on it is fabulous. Good service and an extensive wine list. We love this place."}
{"text":"Pros: very impressed...best steak hands down including Mortons, Flemings, and Ruth Chris. Dessert and sides were just as good. 
Cons: service was mediocre at best and decor and ambiance ok. 

Overall would be back in a heart beat for the great food and overlook the rest."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I have ever had from what is supposed to be an \"upscale\" restaurant. This place used to be pretty good.  However, over the last couple of years both food and service has declined to the point that it is no longer representative of the prices they charge.  Food quality, preparation, and service is inconsistent at best, and just plain terrible at worst. Last  night's experience, which coupled poor food quality WITH terrible service, is the proverbial \"straw that broke the camel's back\".   This place is way too pricey for such inconsistency.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have been told that they updated their dessert menu and it is much better now. I have yet to see for myself. Steaks are still the best around."}
{"text":"Every time I go here, they completely undercook my steak. I order medium rare and it comes out blue rare. Their manager is very rude and unforgiving. Luckily for them, they are in Peoria and are really the only game in town. They wouldn't last in Phoenix or Scottsdale. Firebirds lacks quality beef, but is much more consistent with better staff."}
{"text":"I would give this a 5 star review but the only problem was our lobster Mac and Cheese had spots that were cold  other than that this place is fantastic. I shared the 12 oz Filet with my mom and our husbands both had rib eyes. They were delicious too but I'd recommend the Filet. Flavor was spot on! Our sides were the Au Gratin Potatoes, Lobster Mac and Cheese and the creamed corn. Creamed corn was the best out of the three."}
{"text":"Made a reservation via their website (mytable) for a Friday night at 730.  Was sat immediately  so didn't get much of a chance to look at the total ambiance of the place. Service was ok, not over bearing or absent. Free variety bread basket, was good except butter was semi frozen. 
Ordered a 16 oz strip steak, medium rare. If you don't like a char on your meat, don't come here. Butter soft, dripping with juice.  The steak was 43$, but was ginormous! Well worth the price. Baked potato was perfect, ordered loaded and it came with plenty of deliciousness  (8.99). 
Didn't order a desert, to full. A nice place to go for a treat night."}
{"text":"Went for an anniversary dinner and it was very good! Great service by an enthusiastic Ronnie ( I think) and from bread to dessert, everything was delicious. Best augratin potatoes I have ever had. Well cooked and seasoned steaks! The lobster mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts are divine. I found my new favorite red wine.....The Riddler! We will be back! Thanks for a nice date night!"}
{"text":"Very pricey for what you get. I ordered a 10 oz prime rib cooked medium, it was served medium rare. My wife ordered a delmonico medium and it was served shoe leather well done. The baked potatoes were cold and service was extremely slow. Definitely over over hyped and over priced."}
{"text":"The steaks are perfect...really!  My sister had the asparagus which she said was cooked just right--so often asparagus is undercooked.  The Yukon Gold mashed potatoes tasted so fresh that you would have thought they had just been dug out of the garden.  My husband had the side salad that had the house dressing which was light and vinegary.  The Butter Cake was sublime, making one sigh, \"Oh my goodness.\"  The service was attentive, but not fawning.  Overall, memorable and definitely five star."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this visit fell very flat!!!  The service was way off - Mark O just didn't deliver anything that would make the meal memorable.  He was apathetic and uninterested in our table.  We were celebrating a birthday and he obviously could care less.  Sad when we have had some amazing meals here in the past.  The Delmonico steak ordered Medium Rare showed up well over cooked and only a few bites of Medium steak was available on one end.  After saying they would \"take care of it\" we were discounted a portion of the cost approx 40% - not quite the \"taking care of\" I expected for a quarter edible steak.  The offer to \"bring another one\" doesn't fly when the rest of the table is done eating because your server never came back to check on you.  When you are spending $300 bucks for a meal a certain level of service is expected and unfortunately tonight Arrowhead Grill, Adam O and the working Manager failed on every level.  They get 3 stars because they get a 60% tonight similar to the bill on our inedible 14 oz Delmonico Steak and the Very Poor Service from Mark O!!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst steak (ribeye) I have ever had it was dry and tough. Me and my wife both ordered ribeye medium. Mine was medium well and my wife's was well done. I would not recommend this place to anyone. If you like dry overcooked steaks then go if not then I suggest you go somewhere else. I just threw away 200 on bad food plus tip. I felt sorry for waitress only reason I tipped her."}
{"text":"For as much money as we paid we expected much better service than we received.

The steaks were fine but everything else seemed to be a problem.  We had to send my nephews plate back twice - how hard are sliders??

They had tons of employees milling about, yet it seemed like a lot of trouble just getting water glasses refilled as most of those employees were standing around talking to each other.

Honestly a run of the mill place like Outback is better and cheaper.

I will say its kind of dark and romantic so it might be a decent place for a date night."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my husband as a \"splurge\" meal. Our waitress was polite but nothing about her stood out to me as being excellent as far as her personality or service. The bread was good, came out quick.  I ordered a mule and it was well made and delicious.  I had a starter house salad and while it was very good it was OVER dressed- wayyyyy too much dressing on it and had I known it would be so over dressed I would have asked for the dressing on the side. My husband said he liked the calm chowder and said he liked that they had an ample amount of clam pieces in it. Our steaks came out as ordered... my husband had the Delmonico & shrimp and I had the 8 oz fillet minion.  I was happy to see they didn't over cook our steaks.  They were very tender however, they were over seasoned.  We ordered the lobster mash to share and this too was very over seasoned and salty.  I think it would have been a very good dinner had they not had such a heavy hand in all of their seasoning and dressing.  I think for the amount we spent they shouldn't make simple mistakes such as over using salt and dressing.  Also, the noise in this restaurant is very loud so if you are looking for a quiet romantic ambiance this is not the best for that however it would be a great location for a family event or a dinner with friends or other couples where you can talk.  For the amount we spent we may not return and probably would go to another fine dining establishment where we may not have the issues with the heavy handed seasoning of the food. They blew out my palette."}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot. My wife is a steak snob and this is hands down her favorite and mine as well. Locally owned and all meat is aged and cut in house. It doesn't get any better if your looking for a delicious melt in your mouth cut with a fork steak. Always perfect amazing service. Truly can't say enough nice things about Arrowhead Grill"}
{"text":"Cheese plate is elegant and generously portioned.  Seasonal salad is AMAZING"}
{"text":"Arrowhead Grill has a nice mixture of menu items, ranging from fried comfort food at the bar to upscale dining choices. The girlfriend and I decided to try both and ordered the Artisan Cheese Tray, AG Salad, 14 oz Prime USDA Delmonico Steak, and Chicken Fingers and French Fries. All of the food from the regular dinner menu was good, including the steak. It was cooked perfected, was juicy, and tasty.  the fried chicken fingers were extremely dry and salty. I think Arrowhead Grill could compete with Mortons, Flemings, and Ruth Chris if the presentation was more appealing."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and good almost great service.  They offer dining inside or out as well as a decent bar area.  We dined inside on a Friday night, the restaurant was packed and lively.

We started with the Crab Cake appetizer and they were really good made mostly of crab.  This is not your typical crab cake of mostly bread crumbs but they do charge for the crab.  My wife ordered the Salmon prepared with dill.  She really enjoyed it.  I ordered the Delmonico steak.  The flavor was 9/10 but the cut of beef was chewy and disappointing but the flavor was good enough that I ate it all.  It was prepared perfectly medium rare.  I have a tough time believing that it was a prime grade cut.  I would order the fillet next time.

For sides we had broccoli which was very flavorful.  My wife thought they it had a little to much garlic.  The cheesy potatoes were exceptional as was the Butter Cake desert.  The Creme Brulee was good as well.  

We would go back.  This isn't Texas Roadhouse expect to exceed $100 per person."}
{"text":"This was my husbands and I's first time here. It's very nice inside and quit which is odd with how many people were inside. I ordered a martini and the hubs got a soda. We didn't order any appetizers even though they sounded amazing. I got the French onion soup and some creamed corn which was delicious. Hubs got the bone in rib eye and it was cooked to perfection, as well as the green chili Mac and cheese and shrimp scampi. The Mac and cheese was so good (of coarse I had a few bites). It's pricey, but well worth it. Everything came out hot and the soda was never empty. Our server Kasey was awesome! He was very attentive but not overbearing. It was a nice break for us from the normality of work, kids and just our busy life. Thank you Arrowhead Grill for an amazing night!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there the other night and found out that the only thing about fine dinning was the price. The food was cold, my wife's drink was wrong and mine was weak. The next morning we were both sick..terrible service was the topper. Never again"}
{"text":"Out for a fantastic dinner with some friends from drinks to appetizers and great steaks, then on to the butter cake outstanding! Our waitress Jessica was fantastic ! great smile, knowledgeable ,just all-around terrific job!"}
{"text":"The service was top notch. The drinks were also top notch.  The ambiance was top notch. The food was not so great.  Price is not a problem for me. This location recently added king crab to the menu and I would never order it again.  The entrée was salty and not sweet.  The prime rib was tough and tender depending on the area of the 15 oz. serving. Our anniversary celebration was fun  anyway thanks to the waiter and service!!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner tonight for mother's day/Father's Day gift from kids.  Started with salads, filet with garlic for me and hubby had the bone in ribeye.  Sides mushroom and onions and grilled asparagus. The meal was excellent!  But what can I say....Jerry was our waiter and he was exceptional!  The most polite, charismatic, knowledgeable, friendly waiter we have ever experienced. He immediately welcomed us, and made us feel at ease as if we were long time friends. He made the dining experience to be over the top!  Way to go arrowhead Grill for hiring such a great staff that seem to put customer as #1!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there a few weeks ago when a friend stopped in town from San Diego. I feel like Arrowhead Grill is the\"Pride of the West side\" so I was glad the restaurant was on top of their game. My only complaint is from the bar service. On the rocks means \"Pour the liquor in a glass filled with ice\". Today's bartenders all think every drink needs to be shaken in a shaker first and THEN poured over a glass full of ice. That severely waters down the drink and by the way, that method is what's called an \"up and over\". Which is NOT correct.  Other than that, the food was mostly awesome. One critique - their sides such as the cream of corn are not to my liking. It's just too thick. Best Prime in town in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"Just had another delicious meal at the AG. Our server Clarence (I think that was his name) was wonderful and the service was great on a busy Saturday night. 
Loved my filet and my wife's salmon and Shrimp were tasty also (she shares, or rather barters occasionally).
Pricey like a good steakhouse tends to be, but still a good value."}
{"text":"Best steak I have ever had well worth the price. We go here a couple time a year for special occasions."}
{"text":"Amazing food, especially the steaks. Excellent service, pricey, but definitely worth it.  I would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!  Finally a great steakhouse in the west valley.  Coconut shrimp to start and it was amazing.  Then on to sea bass, strip steak and a volley of wonderful sides! Can't say enough; plus it is not a chain and is locally owned and operated. General Manager Mark was kind enough to stop and chat. Steve, our server was on point. Will be back very soon. Classy solid retreat without being pretentious. Do yourself a big favor and check them out!"}
{"text":"BGreat food, staff needs customer service training: made to feel it was a great inconvenience that we didn't have a RSVP on a Monday night. 1/3 full max during evening. Brought a bottle of wine and of course would order st least one bottle-- No corkage allowed, and we had to REMOVE OUR WINE FROM THE PREMISES--almost lost our pArty of 5 on that one. Overcharged on one of the Orrin Swift Prisoner and Papillon.  Waitress cool and snippy.  Around $500 for really good food (best we've had in the general west side area); just need to fix a few attitudes-- (not ours)."}
{"text":"Love this place and love not having to drive to Scottsdale for a nice dinner. We've gone a few times and actually always ended up with the same server (Marcy), who is wonderful. The food is so yummy, I always get the filet and it's so tender I can cut it with my fork, yes I'm not kidding. Our meals have always been prepared as ordered, taste delicious, and great service.  It's our go to \"let's have a nice dinner\" place and not drive far. We would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's day per friends recommendation. My mom and i both ordered the Delmonico steak. My steak came out fine but my mom's steak was TOO salty. We sent it back and the 2nd steak came out with no flavor. Service was very poor and the restaurant wasn't even busy. We had to ask the waitress to refill our bread and she forgot twice. Manager knew the problem and didn't even stop to talk to us. Worst part is the manager walked away to avoid us as we tried to approach him. For the price we paid for the food we expected better service. Will not go back."}
{"text":"My wife,daughter and myself ate here a few days ago.  This is without a doubt the best restaurant we've ate at since moving to Arizona a year and 1/2 ago.  The service and food was superb.
My daughter ordered the 8 oz filet mignon and said it was the best she's ever had.  Buttery tender with superb flavor cooked to medium perfection.  I had the 22 oz Porterhouse and it was awesome!  It was tender throughout and was cooked meduim rare as ordered. There was not a tough spot anywhere and the flavor was to die for.  My wife had the Chilean sea bass and said it was flakey and cut with a fork tender.  She said the hollandaise sauce that came with it was wonderful, totally smooth and perfectly seasoned.  Don't leave without having the Ghirardelli double chocolate brownie with chocolate ice cream.  This was totally smooth chocolate decadence.
Our server, Roo, was dynamite.  She knew tne menu completly and was able to answer all our questions.  She also came back frequently asking how everything was and continuously refilled our sodas.  The whole time there there was not a time lag in service.  As soon as a course was finished the plates were removed and within a few minutes the next arrived.  
We definitely plan to return here again and will highly recommend it to family and friends."}
{"text":"Sorry.  Not at all worth the money.   Over priced. We actually bought the biggest porter house.  Upon arrival it was cut off the bone, and the fillet was cut in half.   As in half if it was MIA! 

Just like the 'heart' of the grilled artichoke!   We got to the middle and it had been carved OUT of both halves...who does that?  Simply awful

The food is bland and boring. Staff is pretentious.
Not coming back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Staff is friendly and accommodating.  Food is as good as Ruth's Chris.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this will probably forever be my worst higher end dining experience. There was nothing even remotely redemptive about Arrowhead Grill. The service was, well, basically non-existent, the steak was inferior to that of, umm, pick any fairly cheap chain steakhouse, and it's not even much to look at.

Save your money and go to any of the other amazing steakhouses in the Phoenix area - Ruth's Chris, Donovan's etc. Avoid. I'm pretty sure the people who have given this place a good review have never tasted a perfectly prepared steak before."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday with my husband and we had the Prime Rib Dinner special in which we got a three courses meal for $28.99pp. Great price and the food is delicious. It a nice ambient atmosphere and good waiter service. Would come back another day when we craving for steak"}
{"text":"Simply LOVE this place! The food, the service, the friendly staff. It's our special occasion destination...."}
{"text":"The steak, crab leg appetizer, and BLT deviled eggs was amazing. The steak was cooked to perfection. I had order takeout, Tara did a great getting my order together."}
{"text":"Best steak i've had in a long time! i strongly advise the filet, chilie mac n cheese, prosciutto wrapped asparagus and the oysters as the appetizer!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. We had a young lady as our server, and unfortunately her inexperience showed. She was more focused on her \"area\" than she was on us (party of 2).

My wife ordered the lamb chop appetizer as her meal, which was truly tasty... good job! Unfortunately it took about an hour to come out.

The rest of the meal was mediocre. I ordered the twice baked lobster potato and it was overly salted. I also ordered the 10oz Delmonico and it was, at best, par with a steak I can grill at home every evening.

May have been here on an off night, though I'm not sure we're coming back."}
{"text":"Phenomenal filet and shrimp cocktail tonight. Good service and nice pours on the drinks. Very well done."}
{"text":"So our server Jessica was great and very polite, the atmosphere was very nice, and the food presentation was very nice. However everything we ordered (shrimp, steak, lamb, trio fries, asparagus) tasted so boring and plain. This place has no business charging the prices they do when  in all honesty their food tastes identical to an Apple Bees or a TGIF. The food was not bad in any way but fell way below expectations and no where near the price they ask for."}
{"text":"THANK YOU RESTAURANT WEEK!!!  I have been looking at this place for MONTHS on Open Table.  I will say, I was overjoyed.  I didn't realize this is a high end steakhouse comparable, in my humble opinion, to Donovan's and the ilk.  The nice part was, I felt the vibe inside a bit more hip and modern.  

The service was flawless and the food was wonderful.  Steaks cooked perfectly and melted like butter.  If you get a chance to go here, especially for something like restaurant week where you can save some money and really taste the menu, I highly recommend the Arrowhead Grill."}
{"text":"Amazing food the Kobe was the best steak my husband has ever had the sides were very good as well. Thank you such a great meal. My husband wants to go back."}
{"text":"Sorry this place really sucked . 

it was expensive and not worth the money YOU CAN COOK BETTER even if you can't cook..I have no idea why people like and recommend this place . 

anything cheese is from what I had is in a fake cheese sauce . Very orange even more so than Velveeta . 

The side vegetable (was asparagus ) was cooked till it fell apart and with less skill than the local 2 Star Asian Buffet. 

disappointed more so than most places

As only a VERY SLIGHT update 1/22/14

Since my review I haven't been back so I can't update my review but my husband ate here twice. He said the steaks he had were OK. He didn't have vegetables either visit but did have the Green Chile Macaroni and Cheese and said it was very improved from what we had when we were there. I asked him how he'd rate his meals and he said around three stars because it was OK. 

Most likely I won't return anyway."}
{"text":"Yummy... The 48 Oz porterhouse is the bomb... So is the creme brule..Ask for Jessica... She is the best I have had there so far!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here my first night in town with my mom, step father and my grandmother. Upon walking in,I knew we were venturing into an upscale type of steak house-not quite the dark boothed feel of old school and not quite a Ruth Chris atmosphere. 

We were seated in a booth, our waitress was very nice and very young. She advised us of two specials-one a veal chop and one a fish of sorts. My grandmother has been known to love veal chops and we all strongly encouraged her to order one. The rest of the menu was inviting and this is also the type of restaurant where all the sides are a la carte. I ordered the rib eye medium rare and grandma and I decided to share a caesar salad and a baked potato. Mom ordered a salad, step dad ordered prime rib and a potato as well. 

Our salad arrived as well as bread. The first thing I was shocked with is that instead of spitting the salad for us in the kitchen, the brought the salad and an another plate. First of all, in this type of establishment, for these types of prices, and considering the economy,  I was a bit put off but was able to let it go. Our meals arrived on very hot plates. The veal chop was gorgeous-and grandma dove right in. My rib eye was also gorgeous and huge (should have been for $27+), but it was finished off with butter (something I don't like especially without a gallbladder) and had a spicy rub on it. I took two small bites and was overwhelmed by the spicy flavor (something again I hate with a supposed good cut of meat um, hello Outback). 

The prime rib was good (or so I was told) and when the waitress came back(this took a long time as well), I told her that the menu did not state the meat was seasoned nor finished off with butter. She acknowledged I was correct and asked if I would like another steak. At this point, I was done (I get like this when I get mad at food) and said no. She was apologetic and grandma kept on loving the veal chop. I was eating the potato grandma and I were splitting and the owner/chef came to our table and apologized for the steak. I said it was fine, he said he would take it off the bill (DUH) and then I said to him it was probably a good idea to train the waitstaff to advise how the steaks are prepared with spice rub and finished off with butter. He then told me they ARE trained to do this and that our waitress did advise him that she forgot to mention this to us/me. Oh well.

I like the fact this place is not a chain restaurant. I like that my grandmother enjoyed her meal so much. I didn't like the lack of service for the price nor my meal, so I will have to say this place will not be on my \"must visit\" list the next time or any time I am in town."}
{"text":"Really good lunch specials! Their sandwiches are STUFFED with meat, and the sweet potato fries are awesome. You can get a sandwich with side for under $10 for lunch which is a great deal because I ended up eating the other half for dinner. I had the cuban chicken sandwich, which had pickles and mustard inside, and my friend had the turkey club, which I think I will try next time when I feel like eating 3 servings of meat. It's packed with sliced turkey, bacon on grilled wheat bread. They also give rosemary foccacia which is really yummy-crispy on the outside, soft and flakey inside like french bread, but better. Our server was really nice and overall we left full and happy. I would like to come back at some point to try their steaks, the pictures made my mouth water"}
{"text":"An amazing dining experience, made all the better because of our terrific server, Jessica! She rocked it!"}
{"text":"Good Steak, Bad Business!

My husband, our son (aged 7) and I went to Arrowhead Grill to celebrate my hubby's 42nd birthday. 

Upon arrival, we were immediately seated, waitstaff was nice, everything went well till the steaks came out.

We had already had some decent raw oysters, and some ok-not-great- bread.

 My $43 DelMonico (\"our specialty of the house\"!) was so tough I had to send it back. The waiter was appropriately apologetic and brought it back; made me a hew one, but it wasn't done till my family was almost done with the rest of dinner, and I was about full of the a la carte side dishes anyway by that time.(of them, the creamed spinach was VERY good, and the cheesy scallopped potatoes too cheesy and not creamy at all. More like smothered potatoes.)

The manager came over and partially apologized, made sure the new one was good, and told me \"The second steak is on us.\" Like I even got to EAT the first one, OR the second one, since it came out 15 mins after I sent the other back!! For a family of three who had spent $236, they charged me for BOTH Delmonico steaks and then took ONE off. 

BAD BUSINESS! The ENTIRE steak should have been removed from the bill, consistent with policy at other eateries of this caliber. It was not very flavorful but was more tender, but I only ate about 4 bites before I was too full to eat anymore. Plus, now I was annoyed. In this economy, people are more choosy about where to spend their hard-earned money. Why drive people away with an asinine practice like that??

When I complained about the policy, the manager kind of shrugged and said, more or less, it is what it is. He actually smirked. It was very car-salesman-like. (Sorry, car salesmen.)

We will be taking our next $200 meal-eating selves to Ruth's Chris from now on. VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.

On an up note, my husband said HIS filet mignon was one of the best he ever had, AND I have to admit the $7 tableside s'mores are well worth the time and the mere $7 if you have a kid who likes to roast marshmallows and get sticky. The marshmallows were homemade bug square ones cut into four pieces, you get to melt those over a little flame and dip into melted Hershey's chocolate and eat on a graham cracker. That was the best part of the meal for some of us!!

But seriously folks, there's a reason Arrowhead can't play with the big guys...they don't treat their customers like the big guys do. Even though we live nearby, we will make the drive to a better place, where we are bound to get the steak done right the first time; AND get treated right when things go wrong so there will BE a next time."}
{"text":"I'm shocked. A friend took us last night to the Arrowhead Grill and it was spectacular. but most of the Yelp reviews are bad. My Delmonico steak was perfect, the service was terrific. My water glass was always refilled, plates were removed by who ever walked by. 5 star all around so did something change? Does the AG have a new manager or just a new attitude? I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Hello for a first time there  it was very nice experience and there on the. Ball helpful and friendly il be going back a little pricey but I did find something. Way to go"}
{"text":"Amazing! I've been here multiple times for quick lunches and dinner dates. Crab cakes sliders. I always get filet mignon and lobster. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here on date night with another couple before the Cirque show. It was a Thurs... so the place was not that busy. 

Food was excellent. Appetizers were served quickly. Since we were all sharing, the waiter offered to add an extra shrimp to the cocktail - to make 4 (1 for each - they are BIG). He did the same for the other appetizers. Nice touch, made it so we all could have a little taste of each.

Food is served entree and large \"À la carte\" sides - like any good restaurant should. We again split all the sides - with waiter making sure there was plenty for each.

I ordered a margarita (rocks/salt) - came in a 'girly' wide-top glass. I did ask for a normal tall drink bar glass on my refills...waiter obliged with no problems.

Overall - good place for an adult date-night. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing, did I mention amazing? Jerry! Yes, Jerry! (Our server, who was fantastic.) The food was fantastic as well, but having such a professional waiter made it even better. I traveled to Phoenix from California to visit my boyfriend's friends and family. We went to arrowhead for dinner to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday with his mom. The food was amazing and not only that, the way they celebrate someone's birthday is so fun. No singing (thank god) how about a mini firework (doesn't explode) added to the on the house birthday dessert plate? I highly recommend this restaurant to any and everyone who wants to have a great meal, great service and a sense of feeling catered to by staff. The food was fresh, tasted amazing and the wine selection is of quality. Btw Jerry, such a pleasure having you throughly enjoy your job, thank you for the personalized birthday card you also gave my boyfriend. I cannot wait to be back in Phoenix to relive the epic taste left in my mouth from my dinner and experience overall. ."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant,  it is one of my favorites!  I think it rivals any steak house in Scottsdale.  I would highly recommend trying Arrowhead Grill. Some of my favorites are the filet sliders, au gratin potatoes, and pretzel fondue. Best food ever!"}
{"text":"Okay, Charles (the chef/owner- and extremely good at greeting, visiting with customers), you've got me.  Went there last Wed evening with friends from No Calif.  Four great dinners.  WOW!  Meat was done just right, two filets, two Delmonicos.  Jeff the server was fine and attentive without being a pain.  A great experience.  Now we'e going to try the bar menu or the lunch menu..

And the word is getting out - for a Wed, they were fairly busy.  Better call for a reservation on weekends."}
{"text":"There were 5 of us dining at the Grill for diner. Three of the 5 ordered the prime rib special which was a12 oz prime rib. It is a one of them was very fatty and over cooked. Two had  filet and they were done perfectly and excellently seasoned.  Our server was very good. The only down fall to the restaurant is the prices. I felt they were a little high compared to similar class restaurants.  The traditional mac & Cheese side dish is excellent."}
{"text":"We've been here many times for happy hour but never for dinner.  We usually go to Durants for special occasions as it's been our favorite for 16 years, but thought we would try Arrowhead Grill.
Everything was wonderful. My steak was perfect, and so were the sides.
You can't compare the two places, they are completely different.  Durants still has the ol time Frank Sinatra ambiance, and Arrowhead has a newer atmosphere.
Both have wonderful steaks and great service."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I have gone the food is to die for. They have a great wine selection and their steaks are amazing and right up there with some of the top restaurants I've been to. Their side dishes are also amazing would definitely recommend the loaded mashed potatoes and the creamed corn. Not to mention dessert... definitely leave room for dessert you will not be disappointed the butter cake is sinful and the cookie bake with ice cream is to die for. While this place is a little more expensive than other restaurants it's definitely worth it. When I want a nice dinner this is where I go or take visitors."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and ate here a couple weeks ago.  We were really impressed with it!  We shared a Caesar salad, mashed potatoes, and I had the filet.  It was all delicious.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive.  The manager who stopped by our table was also very friendly.  We would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The appetizer- lamb was incredible - shared by the table. We then had their special \"Delmonico\" steak (NY Strip) - It is one of the best steaks I have eaten. The twice-baked potato was also worth it as a side dish."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dinning here for a special event and another evening for HH celebrating my successful accomplishments. During both visits service was exceptional, the dinning is comfortable and a great place locally for something lower key for HH or upscale for a special dinner.  My first visit I had attended a medical conference and we had a prefix menu. I chose the 8oz filet mignon, mashed potatoes and asparagus. I was also introduced to the \"14 Hands\" cabernet. The meal and the vino was yummy! I love the 14 Hands cab so much I found it at Total Wine at a superb price! This restaurant is elegant and you can come in casually dressed.  I am looking forward to future events here and I would very much enjoy if they ever offer live music for a night. I'll be right over! Great place for a date night too. Including a first date. :)"}
{"text":"I was under the impression this place was \"fancy\"! No it's not. You can come dressed casually. Sides are about $8.99+ steaks start at $30.99. Very worth it! Delmonico steak was SOOO good! Perfect! Green chile Mac is very flavorful and you can have it as an entree or to share. The potato au gratin is the same. Sooo much cheese! I could sit there and eat all the sides! Chilean sea bass with macadamia crust was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"So let me preface this by saying, a few years ago, my husband and I stopped into Arrowhead Grill on a whim. We figured, \"Oh it's a grill, it'll be good to grab some food after working out.\" So here we are, a sweaty couple on our way home from L.A. Fitness nearby stopping into Arrowhead Grill. We stepped in, and they warmly welcomed us. The decor took us by surprise. There was rich dark toned wood covering most of the restaurant with detailed ceilings and an intricate waterfall behind the hostess desk, As the hostess sat us, and she handed us our thick leather bound menus, and we both looked at each other in surprise. \"This is a steak house!\" (Similar to that of Morton's or Ruth's Chris of Flemings). Perhaps, we should've looked it up first prior to walking in. However, the food ended up being really good and they treated us very well the entire time. I don't know why we didn't return sooner.

Fast forward to this past Saturday, we finally returned due to a gift card and had another great experience. Compared to the first time, the place was packed on Saturday evening. We couldn't tell though because our waiter was really good. He constantly checked in on us and never rushed us with anything. He was pretty good about timing the delivery of food as well. 

What was memorable?
1. Lamb chop appetizer. Very unique delivery. The lamb chops are like lollipops and you dip it in a strong truffled cheese. I couldn't tell the cheese was truffled but it was still very good and the chops were cooked perfectly. You could bite into them seemlessly which means they were tender and not chewy

2. The AG Mule (Basically a Moscow Mule) - the bartender did great with combining ginger beer and vodka among some other accoutrements

3. The 10 oz filet mignon - order it medium rare and try it oscar style. Oscar style indicates lumps of crab meat covered in Bernaise sauce. Here instead of lumps of crab meat though, they put a crab cake on top of the filet with the Bernaise sauce. Different prep, but still good. 

4. The S'mores dessert is one of the coolest things around. However, it's one of the messiest things I've ever eaten in a restaurant! I just couldn't pass up the homemade giant marshmallows they described to us."}
{"text":"Incredibly underwhelming. Crab legs were sub mediocre, even red lobster is better. The crab legs had such a strong taste of butter you couldn't even taste the crab. My husband ordered the Kobe steak and found it to be decent. Lobster bake potato also sub mediocre. My server did not get to my main course order correct, nor did he get the desert order correct. The icing on the cake was the raspberry cheesecake, which apparently the entire crust is made out of pecans and almonds , something that isn't very typical... Therefore you do you think would be disclosed on the menu... Considering nut allergies are quite common these days. But their coffee is delicious."}
{"text":"Visited on Super bowl Sunday for their special- free Delmonico steak with purchase of side and a drink. 
Steak was cooked very well (i think. I've only recently started eating red meat NOT well done :))! Very tender. Their menu says they use their signature seasoning on all their steaks. Honestly, I thought the seasoning was way too salty, but i usually go very conservative on salt. 
For our side we had the shrimp and grits which was delish! but had a layer of grease on the top (i'm not sure what caused that except maybe the cheese?  or it had the flavor of sausage but I didn't actually notice any sausage but perhaps it was pork fat), and also an order of green chile macaroni and cheese, which was pretty standard and I sort of wished I'd just gotten the traditional mac and cheese.
I had a lovely dirty martini with bleu cheese-stuffed olives and Ben got a glass of the Zinfandel. 

They added onto our bill a gratuity of 18% so our bill for a martini, glass of wine, and 2 sides plus tax and gratuity on the full amount, still came to $58.

I'd probably go again, except that I live in Central Phoenix and like trying new places (which is why I drove all the way up there in the first place)"}
{"text":"I've driven by quite a few times and never stopped in. Our first experience was with a large party of 25. My steak was awesome.. cooked exactly like I like it.  I had the Delmonico with a side of proccutto wrapped asparagus.  A small slice of heaven. The service was excellent.  They pour a good drink too. Highly recommended you stop in for a good steak"}
{"text":"Super cool steakhouse on the west side. Definitely recommend reservations if you're going at a busy time. Have inside and outside seating. Their Delmonico steak is absolutely amazing and one of my all time favorites! They have amazing sides as well. The sides come family style. Broccoli, Mac and Cheese, and all the different potatoes are delicious! The butter cake is delicious for desert! If you're celebrating something special or just want to have a nice date night this is the place to go. I would pick here over Fleming's any day! You will spend some money, but it is more than worth it. Also took my baseball team here as a group, and they took great care of us! This is a must if you're visiting the valley and want a steakhouse, and has choices for those not wanting steak!"}
{"text":"As always the food was excellent and the service was even better!!!! 
Daughter bday celebration can't go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"Favorite wait staff of all times Troy and James are AMAZING!!! We love the patio ambience. And happy hour menu is a bonus great deals and great food. My favorite is the clam chowder (very very delish) and the Oh So Incredibly Scrumptious BUTTERCAKE!!!"}
{"text":"Went here again tonight for a birthday and sat in Charles section and I have to say everytime I'm come here it gets better and better. Love this place. The service was amazing the food was to die for and the company was beyond."}
{"text":"My 2nd visit here and it is just not my favorite steak place. Service with Jerry is top notch best. I don't like the seasoning rub so I had them hold it. I think I'm allergic to it. Ordered medium rare but it came out less than rare. Jerry took care of it promptly. The ag mashed potatoes are good and others had the broccoli cheese and lobster and Mac cheese. Both excellent."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  Very good steaks,excellent sides, and good appetizers.  Price is a little steep, but they have specials a few times a week, that will enable you to give the play a try.  Excellent service too."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour and dinner a week ago  - their wine selection is pretty good (but I am a wino/snob). They are a little pricey - but you get what you pay for! This isn't Black Angus people!
The oysters on the half shell are to die for, the steak is always cooked perfect as you asked for and delicious, the sea bass.....ooooooh my! Lobster mashed potatoes....oh yeah that's a grip of lobster in there! They do not skimp and always go with the recommendations like making the steak 'oscar' and macadamia nut crusting the fish!
Also, their wait staff is awesome and attentive...i never had to fill my wine glass myself or neither did my friend -- they were always around to refill us until our bottle was gone. Great atmosphere, great food great customer service. One of my fav restaurants and you don't have to go to Scottsdale for this kind of food & service folks!!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service from our server Brent was superb!

Arrowhead Grill is the nicest place West of Central."}
{"text":"Impeccable service, food and establishment. Highly recommend when you are splurging on a nice meal. Definitely on the pricey end but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great appetizers and cocktails with family tonight. Jennifer (think that was her name) was wonderful; gracious with wine pairing and answering our questions. After dinner my husband couldn't find his phone and figured we left it at the restaurant. After hours; they looked for it and were very kind. The manager was great as usual. Always greets us and says good bye."}
{"text":"Incredible service and food!!  So happy this place is open.  My husband and I opted to stopped going to bettys nosh because of the crazy owner and hot tempered manager.  We just hope our favorite bartender finds his way here and this place would be perfect."}
{"text":"Wow!  Just had the most amazing steak, and I didn't have to drive to Scottsdale to get it.  It was cooked perfectly, which is so \"rare\"!  Also, you have to try the fried green beans.  Martinis added a nice touch and the atmosphere was great.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"To be fair, probably worth more stars, but took my wife here for Valentine's. I wasn't the only one who thought that would be a nice treat, making the place super busy. we were in the restaurant for two solid hours. 

The food was good, the service was nice and courteous, the bill was, as expected, more than your average dining bill.

We did leave there stuffed with desert to go. 

Very comparable to a Flemings."}
{"text":"Wife and I went last Friday to celebrate our 5th anniversary and it did not disappoint. Made reservations and was seated quickly. We ordered the calamari and a couple of drinks. Then we decided to both order the 10-oz Delmonico and Lobster Mashed Potatoes. Todd our waiter brought out a desert for us to share and the plate said Happy 5th Anniversary. It was such a nice touch and we appreciate the dinner and overall atmosphere of this place."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places when I am in Arizona! The food is always great, the steaks are always cooked perfectly, and the service is spot on. My personal favorite is the lamb chop fondue appetizer,  and this time we tried the pretzel fondue (from the happy hour menu) and it was delicious! The best way to end the meal is with a butter cake, so yummy!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for quite some time, we love wine down Wednesdays, half price wines in the bar and a great priced menu.
Ask Clint for his recommendation for wine, always spot on."}
{"text":"We ate her for mothers day, it was a set menu and we ordered the delmonico and the filet with bacon. Both were delicious, but the delmonico definitely was head and shoulders above. For the tasting menu, it was a salad or soup, and entree and a side for around $60. This was a vast improvement over the previous nights dinner and another steakhouse who's prices were 60 for just a steak (both in price and quality). We normally eat here at least 3 times a year and is my steakhouse of choice. The waiter was extremely attentive (without being annoying).  I highly recommend this place for a great steak."}
{"text":"This place is so great! Great service and food!  Funny how you can be pleased spending $170 on dinner and and be upset on a $50 meal at another place. Definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"Will never dine here again.

It was my birthday. Kinda packed. They sat us outside. Took literally 30 minutes to get my first drink. Beer came warm, obviously poured a while ago. Took 40 minutes to get my second beer. This time it was cold because it was right after I complained. Got my $72 Kobe, ordered medium rare. Came blue. I complained again. They took my steak and cooked it again. At the time they took my cutlery and plate too so I couldn't even eat sides while I waited. Steak came back cooked properly in the center but now it was charred. Also did not have the same consistency as you'd expect for a Kobe. Actually tasted frozen (tho I don't believe it was, just tasted that way). We got free deserts for our trouble and spent literally 3 hours sitting outside mostly unattended (except the water boys who did just fine) - bill was astronomical. Didn't get the sparklers and stuff that the people with the birthday in the table next to us got (that's what they always do) - most frustrating customer experience I have ever had in a \"high end\" steak house.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Went with 2 friends.  I had the 8oz. filet and my friend had the delmonico.  We had loaded baked potatoes and brussel sprouts.  For desert we had the butter cake ala mode, it was amazing.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live about 2 miles from here and after a year of saying we should try it, we finally tried it. We went on a Friday after work, around 5. The ambiance is pretty impressive, not what you'd expect from a small corner restaurant. We were seated right away and greeted by our server with a cute basket full of 5 different breads, which they all were really tasty. The menu is short and sweet. I had the AGX to drink which was really good. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Delmonico steak, this was one of the top steaks I've ever had. Juicy with the right amount of seasoning, definitely didn't need steak sauce. To top it all off, we got free dessert for being first-timers. Coming here will be the one of the best decisions you'll ever make! Although, expect a fancy bill for the fancy dinner."}
{"text":"The perfectly west side steakhouse! I don't mean that as an insult! I love being able to go to places with decent food and a more sophisticated atmosphere and still be able to dress casually (casual for me, at least). Arrowhead Grill is the perfect place to do just that. The Not Boyfriend and I sat on the patio for happy hour and while it was chilly the heaters were perfect. The Charles Krug Cabernet was recommended by our server and it was fantastic. Super bold but still smooth. As usual, I ordered a ton of food. We got the lamb chop fondue, the lamb was cooked to perfection but the fondue missed the mark. It was supposed to be a Truffle Tremor goat cheese but it was so mild- you couldn't even smell the truffle. The fried green beans were good but pretty standard. The big hit was the filet sliders. I was expecting tiny little things but for $7 you get what looked like 6oz of filet cooked to order. One of the three sliders was well done when we ordered medium rare, it was still tender but grey throughout. I would come back for a full meal and see what else they have to offer!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant in Arrowhead/Peoria. My boyfriend and I went on a date during restaurant week. The ambiance was upscale and friendly. We ordered from the pre-fixe menu. It was $44 for a salad or soup, entree and dessert. 

My boyfriend had the Delmonico steak and mashed potatoes. I've never seen him enjoy a meal to the point where he slowed down to savor it. I had the prime rib and broccoli. They were incredible. I'm only 100 lbs and rarely finish a restaurant portioned meal but I cleaned my plate! Butter cake is a must. Overall, a great choice especially for this area."}
{"text":"Love this place! 
Been here numerous times and im still in love. great food awesome service.
deserts are delish! especially the tres leches creme brulee AHHHH! :0 so good!
i yet have to try other thigs since i always stick to Filet Mignon, Mashed potatoes, Asparagus & sauteed mushrooms w/ onions! i did try the whole chicken from my mother last time and it was delicious as well.

5 stars!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here a couple of nights ago. Have been here many times and always enjoy the food and service. Steaks were great, particularly the bone-in filet. Our server Marcie was terrific as always. This place continues to deliver the whole package. Thanks AG and Marcie!!"}
{"text":"Surely the best restaurant in the West Valley when it comes to fine dining.  Though, it doesn't have competitors, does that really count?

Why go there:
It is fine dining where their steaks are surely the highlight.  Their a la carte menu is decent, a bit on the pricey side when it comes to price for where this is located, but they seem to retain a good clientele.  Happy Hour is a good time to hit Arrowhead Grill to see if you'd like the place for a more formal meal.  They offer burgers and other goodies at a good price, though you have to sit on the patio and or the bar area.  Which is not a bad deal, you still have access to anything they serve in the main dining room. The attention from the waiters is as good at the bar area/patio during Happy Hour as when you would eat in the main dining room. That's why we are back.  They have good etiquette and know their menu.

Don't Miss:
The rib bone at happy hour.  Ask for it with the creamy horseradish.  For the price, give it a go, you won't regret it.  It's also fun to eat with your hands in a place that has $$$ signs.  The Signature Butter Cake is also a must from the dessert card.  If you don't order it, a small sample of it is available on your way out at the hostess' desk. Grab one on the way out... or two.

Tip: If there is a wait at Happy Hour, put your name in, wait at least 20 mins even if they tell you 30-45 mins.  People tend to give up and bail.  It's worth hanging around."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Come prepared to spend $$$ but it was worth it. My husband and I both loved it. Service was remarkable and the atmosphere was very relaxing."}
{"text":"My sister and I ended up here after trying to find a restaurant that was open during the Super Bowl (ahh, America...your restaurants and shops are open on almost all holidays but not Super Bowl Sunday). Arrowhead Grill was quiet, but that was expected. The staff was very nice and didn't rush us even though we were there past closing time. We ordered some light food because we weren't in the mood for a heavy meal. Even the simple things we ordered were presented in a cool manner. I got the s'mores dessert which came me with a teeny tiny fire pit on the plate and homemade marshmallows. I would love to come back for another special occasion."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it is close to my house butttttt unfortunately, it fell short. I had a reservation on a Friday evening. Service was terrible. After ordering drinks, the waitress inadvertently knocked the straw out of my drink. No big deal, but after she apologized, she never brought out a new straw.  She was inattentive and we felt like we were inconveniencing her.

I could look past bad service if the food was great.  But it wasn't.  Prosciutto wrapped asparagus was like leather wrapped asparagus. One steak was ordered medium and came out bleeding rare. Everything was as though they added a ton of salt and butter. Waters were never refilled. I recently ate at Hillstone, which at the same cost, was leaps and bounds above Arrowhead Grill. Too bad - I really wanted AG to be worth it."}
{"text":"Oh dear!
We really enjoyed this restaurant, especially going at the weekends for Happy Hour.  To our disappointment no more weekend happy hour.  The bar was almost empty ( I wonder why?) the drinks are now sadly overpriced, and not that great. The food is still good ( especially the shepherds pie, made with lamb as it should be  It is expensive. Gone are the days when we would make the drive over there. Value for the $$ is just not there......so many other places to go in the Valley."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD AND SERVICE!! Been here a few times and never ceased to amazing how good the food is! The server was well versed in his menu. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is 5 star with 2 star pretentiousness. Such a great local gem. Great food, great cocktails and great service. Excellent wine list and great happy hour. I always go for the delmonico. Love the green beans side. Love the butter cake and when we do get dessert, they do serve a smaller portion of the butter cake so you can have a small couple of bites and not a huge ol butter cake."}
{"text":"I really love this place, and if I was wealthier, I'd eat here regularly. For now, I'll stick to enjoying the once or twice a year splurges during Arizona Restaurant Week. 

This place is unassuming from the outside. You just don't expect a steakhouse of this caliber stuck next to a highway overpass deep in the blue collar suburbs. This is Scottsdale level food at Scottsdale level prices, but worth every penny. 

The staff are always cordial to friendly, and make sure to take newbies through the menu for each visit. The steaks and a la carte sides are fantastic, and I really like the salads there. The little touches like the hot plates and buttered meat are what puts this place above your chain style steakhouses. 

Desserts are always on point. The butter cake is worth a try, but there are always more interesting options on the menu."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this place has the best burger in town! Prime steakhouse where they hand cut steaks in house and grind trimmings for burgers. I like the AG burger cooked medium, is topped with thin sliced prime rib, onion straws and cheese with a side of creamy horseradish...... outstanding burger, oh yeah and if you go between 3-6p for happy hour, the bar menu offers the burger at a huge discount where you can get the burger for close to what you pay at fast food joints for a meal! 

This is just about the burger, the rest of the menu is off the hook with things like Artisan mac and cheese as well as lobster mash potatoes."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in the west valley. The ambience and service are top notch. The bread service is warm and delicious. On this trip we orders the cheese tray, 4 awesome cheeses, great chutney, bread, cranberry nut spread. The AG salad has a great mix of goat cheese, pecans, mixed greens and a great light vinaigrette. The 8oz filet was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The whole chicken is quite the experience and beyond delicious. After picking at the carved up bird, I was full and took the cut up chicken to go. The artichoke special was a great side, grilled to perfection."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and delightful....great customer service!!!!!!
Prime Rib prefix is exceptionally priced and if you want to step it up it's all on the menu!!"}
{"text":"My husband got the rib eye. He says it is the best steak ever. I get the AG salad, excellent also!
Service is very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Went again last night. Still good service. It was Happy Hour so sitting in the patio took a bit longer, but it was busy and we try to be understanding. The waitress was still attentive as was the bus staff. I got the sea bass and it was great, the hubs got the Delmonico which he wasn't fond of, the seasonings weren't to his liking. The manager came by and swapped it out for the filet which we've had and my husband likes a lot, despite the fact my husband had already eaten half the steak. He comped the Delmonico for us. The only thing that seemed a little off were the maple mashed sweet potatoes, there was too much spice added. I'm not sure if it was cloves, cinnamon or what, but the food and service was still great."}
{"text":"Steve our server is fantastic, we stopped by for Happy Hour and h e made us feel like we were celebrating a special occasion. He is very good at what he does.
The cheeseburger sliders were fantastic as was the pork wing, drinks were spot on, my wife loved the pear martini.
B e sure and get there earlier if you want a seat inside, especially when it's hot out. We did sit on the patio and it wasn't bad in the shade."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for steak! The Delmonico is to die for; add scallops, maple mashed sweet potatoes, and prosciutto wrapped asparagus is to die for. We go here for special occasions and happy hour is the best around. Friendly staff and the place is always clean. Their signature Butter Cake ~~~~ OMG you have to try it."}
{"text":"NYC level steakhouse. Bone in ribeye was delicious. If I went again I would try the bone in filet or the Delmonico. The butter cake dessert is arguably the best dessert I have had in my whole life. Mark was our server and he actually knew his cuts of meat really well. Personally I get frustrated when I go to a great steakhouse and the server doesn't know their cuts or god forbid doesn't like steak. I know that sounds crazy but it has happened. Mark also has a solid beard so you know you can trust him. The creamed spinach wasn't good but I'm glad the whole experience wasn't perfect. Just makes them more credible for having a shortcoming. You can't trust someone/a restaurant if they are perfect. You can definitely trust Mark though. Then again, Mark took the spinach off without us even requesting because we told him it was the only part of the meal we weren't a fan of. So that kind of makes the place perfect. So on second thought, keep an eye on Mark. He is perfect and not to be trusted."}
{"text":"Left, busy! Waited 15 minutes without being greeted too many good choices of places to eat. We'll try again, heard great reviews."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent Arrowhead Grill and constantly sing its praises for both food and service.  However, our experience on 1/31 for our wedding anniversary did not live up to the normal first class service.

We had a reservation (notating that it was our anniversary), were sat immediately and wished a happy anniversary by our hostess.  All good so far.

Our server, Todd than came over, and we immediately noticed he didn't have the normal demeanor and charisma that we have become accustomed to at AG.

We ordered our drinks. My wife ordered a Dirty Shirley, Todd said that he didn't know what that was so we explained that it was a Shirley Temple with vodka.  He left the table for a few minutes and came back to ask if my wife wanted it on the rocks or in a martini glass which we thought was a little odd.  My wife stated she would like it on the rocks.  A few moments later the drinks were quickly dropped off at the table and it was immediately obvious that my wife's drink was incorrect.

Since Todd had dropped the drinks off so quickly, we didn't get a chance to mention it to him.  So we asked the gentleman that brought our bread to please ask our server to come back over.

When Todd came over he said, \"Yes?\".  My wife let him know that her drink was not a Dirty Shirley but just a dirty martini on the rocks.  My wife explained that a Dirty Shirley is Sprite, grenadine and vodka.  Todd's response was the true sign that he has no business serving at AG. He said, \"Well I typed in Dirty Shirley and that's what he made.\"  Excuse me? I don't care for your excuses to begin with but to throw the bartender under the bus and not take ownership to fix the problem?

He did bring the correct drink back, he was scarsley seen the rest of the night. He did not offer us desert or wish us a happy anniversary.  It's not my style to complain to management at a restaurant, instead Todd received a 15% tip instead of my standard 25%."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight! First timer! The food was incredible. I am not a meat eater but found there was plenty of other options to indulge in! I had the lobster baked potato and a salad and both were superb! Service was excellent and the free bread was delicious! We went for a birthday and were given a gift card to use when we return. This is a great place and way better than Flemings. The four stars was only because it is a bit too pricey...$17 for a potato... but do not confuse lack of stars for flavor because it certainly delivers on that spectrum! Service and ambiance were certainly on point as well. Go Arrowhead Grill for getting rid of the stuffy white tablecloth yet not letting the guest know it in terms of service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! The filet mignon is awesome and the AG mashed potaoes are amazing! Great place to go for a celebration dinner! It's pricey but we'll worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Had the Alaskan halibut and tried some of their butter cake sample. The halibut was done a-ok (gave it 3 stars for that) but the butter cake takes the cake (no pun intended), hence the 4 stars. I guess they are known for their MEAT...."}
{"text":"Great place for appetizers. It is busy on Wednesday nights for wine down Wednesday. We really like the waitresses and waiters. The butter cake is incredible and they have great steaks."}
{"text":"This place is a must go for anyone in the valley. In my personal and professional Italian opinion (wink, wink), their calamari is TO DIE FOR. It is quite possibly the best calamari I have ever had...EVER! The little baby corn and the dipping sauce is delightful. If you go, you must dig deep into your pockets and pay the extra dollar for the Kobe beef. It is melt in your mouth delicious and absolutely, without a doubt heaven for your tastebuds! The staff is wonderful about spacing out appetizers, salads, etc. I am definitely this places #1 fan. Top 5 of my favorites list in the entire valley."}
{"text":"I had heard plenty of great things from my friends in Phoenix about Arrowhead Grill.  Well, they weren't wrong.  During my last visit to Arizona I decided to stop in to check out the joint.  Not only was the food amazing, the service was spectacular.  My server, Roo, went above and beyond.  She was attentive with great suggestions.  She was there when we needed her while not being intrusive in the least.  Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll be visiting Arrowhead and I hope Roo will be working."}
{"text":"If it's a night out with your significant other or friends than this is the place to check out for dinner. Living on the west side of town, this is by far the classiest restaurant. 

AG is well known for their main course, sides and their dessert is definitely to die for. Their collection of wine list is endless and their drink menu is great. I had their AG Mule, amazing!!!! 

I am a vegetarian so they are always accommodating with my meals.  My favorite would have to be their butter cake with fresh cream that is made in house. Another item is to try their Creme Brûlée."}
{"text":"We have been to AGs many, many times. It's our fave spot for visiting guests, special family occasions and just when we are in need of a really great meal. Kumamoto oysters are a great appetizer.  Small, sweet, clean and fresh. The AG Delmonico steak is the best steak I have ever had - I'm comparing it to Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Gene & Georgettis, etc. AGs out does them all on this cut. Great sides, desserts and wine selection. Vibrant bar area and they somehow created a cozy outdoor patio area despite the difficult corner location on 101 and Union Hills.   The menu is a bit pricey but not when compared to comparable restaurants. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here a few days ago for our 1 year! I had no idea what to expect but good lord was I in for a treat. Our server was Nate and he was extremely knowledgeable in all of the steaks and different types of wine. WELL WORTH THE PRICE! I've never had better steak. We ordered sides of artichoke and Brussel sprouts and both were also to die for. Our waiter knew we were celebrating and gave us complimentary sauces for our steaks and a desert where they wrote \"Happy Anniversary\"! (Ps- their butter cake is legitimately the best thing you will ever put in your mouth). At one point the owner came by our table (at least I think it was the owner or at least a manager) to make sure our meal was ok and we couldn't praise enough. So thanks Arrowhead Grill and Nate for making our night so wonderful! We tried to track down the guy who stopped by our table to sing praises on our server and couldn't find him so I hope this reaches someone. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone wanting to splurge on a romantic and delicious meal."}
{"text":"Prime steaks and excellent table side service at reasonable prices what's not to like?
Decent wine selection domestic & international.
One of the best restaurants in the Northwest Valley!"}
{"text":"Kim's service on the patio tonight helped to make it a perfect dining experience! Bacon wrapped filet was perfectly cooked, especially the smokey bacon. The delmonico and lobster tail were delicious, and that butter cake dessert.... Amazing!! No wonder they won an award for it!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what's up with the bad reviews but this is the best place for dinner or special events. Hands down the best steak, lobster mash potatoes and great scallops. Also one of the best desserts in town. Butter cake and key lime pie Yum!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  Ordered the 22 oz bone in ribeye medium rare(confirmed the red center, pink throughout with the server) and got a 1/4 to 3/8 in thick breakfast steak cooked medium well.  The ladies ordered Sea Bass and said it was good, but my friend ordered prime rib and it was overcooked.   Size of the sides were disappointing- AG mashed potatoes came in a small bowl that was a small single portion - definitely not shareable.   Same for the asparagus.   The baked potato was good sized however.

Get the kids off the grill.   Two stars if it was a neighborhood steakhouse with moderate prices.  Zero to one star for a splurge steakhouse.   BTW: I'm really not that cranky of a guy - it was that bad."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I stopped in for wine and appetizers on Tuesday evening.  We sat at the bar and were there for about 2 1/2 hours.  It's not my first time at AG and I've always enjoyed the food and service as being ok.  This visit was no different.  The bartender was not attentive whatsoever and actually seemed distraced by a female in workout attire sitting at the other end of the bar, maybe his girlfriend?!  He was somewhat pleasant but it was hard to get his attention and we had to ask for everything.  He never offered us food menus or inquired if we planned on eating.  I really like the fact that this is not a chain and the food is usually better than the chains too.  BUT for the prices here I think they could do better.  I'm pretty certain my bill would have been bigger with more attentive service and I can guarantee his tip would have been."}
{"text":"Great food and our waiter couldn't have been friendlier! I got the newyork strip steak and mywife got the seabass. Both were some of the best we ever tasted"}
{"text":"First timers!! This restaurant came highly recommended by several so rather than heading to Scottsdale we ventured to Glendale to try this restaurant out. What a great recommendation!! We enjoyed a great steak dinner with awesome sides and topped off the night with their signature butter cake which is a must have. Our server Ashley made the evening exceptional with her great service and recommendations. Put on your list of places to dine!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very pretty and the ambience is nice. It is cozy with a fire place. It is pricey so be prepared to pay. We came for the lamb! The lamb I must say was absolutely delicious perfectly flavored in cooked. However I think since we don't care for truffle fondue they could've substituted something for that being that you're paying almost $17 for three pieces of lamb. We also got a house salad which was very good. Make reservation unless you are sitting outside or in bar area. **No military discount ** overall nice place..."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and very friendly employees but....had the toughest steak I've ever had in a restaurant. It was cooked medium and had very nice flavor as promised. It would have been fine to send it back but I never do it. The twice baked potato seemed old because the bottom of it was as hard as wood. Neither my wife or I could cut it with a knife. With 15.00 drinks and 50.00 steaks I would rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My wife and I love a good steak so we thought we'd try Arrowhead Grill. 

The first thing we noticed was the short wine list.  For an upscale steak house the wine list should be much larger. But we were able to find a nice cabernet sauvignon, although it was a little expensive for a half-bottle.

We started with the grilled artichoke as an appetizer. It was fantastic. By far the best artichoke I have ever had, bar none.   Amazing combination of spices and dipping sauce.  Try it you won't be disappointed. 

For our entrée we both ordered the bone-in fillets with scalloped cheese potatoes and, of all things, the sautéed  hominy and bacon.   We ordered the steaks medium rare but they came out medium. The waiter noticed the steaks were over-cooked immediately and the chef came out immediately and apologized for the mistake.  We got new steaks 10 minutes later and they were cooked to the right temp. They both had very good flavor and seasoning.     Both side dishes were excellent. The chef also brought out another side dish that was not on the menu - grits!  Now these are not the kind of grits you might expect.  They were, for lack of a better work, gourmet grits.  Creamy, spiced nicely and covered in melted cheese.   I am not a grits fan but these were very good!  Very creative. 

We finished with the butter cake for desert. Very satisfying. Rich but not too rich.  Enough for two to share. 

Overall a very good dining experience.  The restaurant had only been open for about five weeks, so it was easy to excuse the under-cooked steak. And I believe this mistake was a rare one (no pun intended) as the chef and waiter were very surprised about it and worked hard to make sure it didn't ruin our diner. 

Four stars only because of the poor wine selection. 

We will return."}
{"text":"This place is great for happy hour but if you go when it's hot outside you will wait forever to get a table!  It would be nice if 1) they put misters out on their outdoor patio so you could sit and eat comfortably, and 2) during slow season they should allow you to get happy hour items and pricing in the dining room!  I love he food and drinks but I hate the wait so we rarely go."}
{"text":"Curious as to why they name their restaurant Arrowhead \"Grill\" when they broil there meat...not a fan.  I have no problem paying a lot for a good meal that has great flavor and is palate pleasing.  This food reminded me of what you would get in a cafeteria.
Hostess was snotty, wait staff were nice, restaurant was quite loud."}
{"text":"Great restaurant on the west side. We almost always eat in the bar area which is first come first serve and always busy. Great bar menu and happy hour. Lamb chop fondue, AG burger, mixed grill, and the raw oysters are some of my favorites.  I also love the butter cake. Not quite Mastros but still a great experience every time. Great cocktails as well."}
{"text":"I decided to give this little hole in strip mall another go.   Not such a great decision.  Prices are still waaayyyy too high for the quality.  The lunch menu is downright pedestrian and the dinner we had was oh so ordinary.   I think people like this place because they have no other options.   Sad, sad, sad. Just sad."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better is about right with this place. Arrowhead Grill, your food was good, but when I'm shelling out $200 for dinner for two, I expect top notch service and ambience. We tried this place for the first time last night. We usually go to flemmings, but wanted to try something different. The place was loud and  there was a crying baby. The large dried red leaves that decorated the walls were very gaudy and the lighting was way too bright. I could have looked past all of this if our service was better. Our waitress while she seemed to be nice, was odd. She said \"I can offer you the calamari or butter cake\" we had no idea what that meant.  We thought she recommended those items, but later found out we got one free for being 1st timers. Which was generous I guess. Other than that, they were out of pear martinis, they did not refill drinks. I wanted a glass of wine with my steak and the wine came after I was done with my steak. The bus boys seem to be all high school age and when one cleared our bread plates, the butter knife fell to our table and the butter splattered on the table and my dress. No one cleaned up the table for us. However, the steaks were good, but I can get good steaks and much better service at Flemmings or Mastros....."}
{"text":"D-licious!!! We have been wanting to come here for a while, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much bigger it looks on the inside than just driving by. We were able to get a reservation on a Friday night within about an hour, and once we arrived were pleasantly greeted and seated within minutes. Our server was Steve who was also very pleasant, friendly, and informative. Although I couldn't partake in any spirits it appears they have many to choose from, and looks like an extensive wine list that I can't wait to try next time! Side note, they do not have beer on draft. Only by the bottle. They brought and assortment of bread, all very good. My husband ordered the Rhode Island calamari for an appetizer. I personally don't eat seafood, but he is from Boston and said it was the best he's ever had so I'll take his word for it. For our main course I ordered the 8oz filet medium well and classic mac 'n cheese, my husband ordered the 22oz prime rib and the Yukon gold mashed potatoes. It seemed to take a while for our meals to come, maybe due to it being a busy Friday evening. I started to get a little impatient. But once our food arrived I had no complaints. My filet was cooked to perfection, and tasted AMAZING! The mac 'n cheese was good, for me it had a little bit of a sweet taste. I tried the mashed potatoes and they were creamy and seasoned just right! I saw a previous review that bashed the atmosphere saying that it was not up to par with the prices. I didn't notice. All I can say about that is I'd rather have a spectacular meal for my money than a fancy chair or light. The restaurant itself was clean and well kept as were the servers and wait staff. For my next visit I would like to try being seated on their patio (weather permitting of course!) I drove by this place for years not realizing it's probably one of Peoria's best fine restaurants, and best kept secrets! I'll definitely be returning and spreading the word! No need to drive into the city or all the way to Scottdale for a prime piece of meat!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was really good. Party of 8 with complaints from the two that ordered the AG Delmonico steaks. Over cooked and a little chewy.  The Small cut of prime rib for $35 was , well, really small.  The wild salmon blackened was the best I have ever had and the lobster mashed were a hit. The service was great but I am confused why it was about $80 a person to have dinner with only a few drinks and not one bottle of wine to Jack up the bill.  That took it from a weekly event for my group to a once in awhile treat."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because of all the reviews......we were there a total of 1.5 hours due to the slow service. The waitress didn't check on us after food was delivered, and we both were out of our drinks including our waters.  Horrible service. She, (and most of the staff) act d as if they didn't want to be there.

Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and atmosphere....Only thing missing was some leg room in the dining room...I visit many steakhouses around the country in this is in my Top Ten..great job...."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Arrowhead Grill for my Third Wedding Anniversary.  I will defiantly be returning again for dinner.  

I ordered the Delmonico Steak, Oscar Style, and my wife had the Chilean Sea Bass.  The dinners were excellently prepared, although in the future I'm sure I can pass on the Oscar Style for the steak.  The sides were also great, my wife especially enjoyed the Lobster Twice Baked Potato. 

We booked our reservation through OpenTable and mentioned it was our Anniversary when booking. At the conclusion of our dinner our waiter brought out a complementery Butter Cake dessert with \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate.  We were a little disappointed that they had ran out of  Crème Brulee. (I was surprised since there was very few other people dining [Tuesday at 8:00pm])

I have to also agree with other reviews , it would be nice if the dining room lights were a little darker (The only reason I even noticed this was from reading other reviews though).

Overall, the dining experience was wonderful, I also enjoyed the close West Valley Location.  The Food and Service (Jeff) was perfect."}
{"text":"WOW!!   Went here last Monday night and everything was just superb.   I had been to the Arrowhead Grill about four times previous to this visit and decided  never to go back due to such poor service.    Then I received a promotional e-mail for a \"buy one get one free\" Delmonico steak.    Decided to give them one more chance.   Sure glad I did.   Service was top notch and food was excellent.  In addition to the Delmonico's we ordered 1 small house salad, side of mushrooms/onions, side of broccoli with cheese sauce, Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, and the Smore dessert.   Everything was great.   I think they are really working on the service as I observed other waiters at other patron's tables that were very friendly and efficient in addition to our waiter.    The food has always been good here it's just the service that was so poor.   Give them a chance.  I think they really are trying to improve.   If you do go sign up for their e-mail club and you will get special offers sent to you."}
{"text":"An update to my prior review to add the final star.  While I've only checked in 3 times, I've been here much more.  I only gave 4 stars before because of shoddy service on one particular Saturday night in the bar.  But after having been on very busy nights since then, I realize that was a one time anomaly.  AG is fantastic - food and service.  It is my wife's number one choice for date night."}
{"text":"This is simply the best steakhouse in the northwest valley.  Yes, it's on the expensive side.  Yes, you should have high expectations.  We choose to go to the bar where it's more laid back.  I could see where higher expectations must be met in the dining room.  If you enjoy cocktails, see Casey at the bar.  He does a nice job with a variety of spirits.
Maybe my rating would be lower if we had more places of this type in the area.  I am very grateful to have this spot near us."}
{"text":"Moving here to Arizona from San Diego, I needed to explore other options without going into a chain Steakhouse such as Flemings, Morton's or Ruth's Chris.

Review:

1) Appetizer - Lamb chops with fondue dipping sauce.  I consider this as the go to \"MUST\" order.  Simply amazing.  It was so yummy that I started dipping the bread on the cheese bowl.
2) Steaks - I wanted to try their Delmonico instead of going with my traditional filet.  Cooked perfectly and juicy.  I will need to try other cuts next time to complete the review.
3) Sides - Loaded bake potato was great, I just wished that I ordered additional sour cream on the side.  The Brussel sprouts was good and flavorful, but it is nothing out of the ordinary where it made me say OMG.  I will try others to finish my review.
4) Dessert - I should have gone with their signature Buttercake.  I will next time for sure.  Instead I decided to go with the Key Lime Pie.  The crust was unbelievably out of this world good, i wish the inside filling was less sweet.

Overall, the experience warranted a 4 Star.  I will definitely come back to try all the other offerings."}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite places to splurge on a nice dinner.  I love that we don't have to drive to scottsdale for a great dinner. 
can't say enough about the staff.  The manager couldn't have been more professional and sincere.  The bone-in ribeye was prepared to perfection.  You will leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Delicious! I cannot wait to go back here.  I was a little hesitant going because I do not eat steaks or much meat all together. We also were bringing the baby and I was worried she wouldn't be welcome. It was not that way at all though. The staff was super friendly and didn't care that she spilled food all over the place. The service all together was excellent. The food was amazing. I ordered the salmon. I usually do not like salmon I get in restaurants because it can lack flavor or be dry. This was the best salmon I have had. My husband ordered the filet. For 7 years he has been comparing all his steaks against a steak we had in San Luis Obispo, arrowhead grill has now taken top honor. He said it was the best steak of his life. That is a major accomplishment. The sides were all amazing. We got the trio of fries. I highly recommend them. I love fries with dipping sauce. The Mac and cheese was loved by the baby. 
Oh the bread basket is fantastic too. So many different choices! The drinks were strong and tasty. Overall and amazing experience and I can't wait to go back. I just need a special occasions since it is expensive. Maybe a groupon will pop up?"}
{"text":"Wow!!  Seriously one of the best places I have eaten in a very long time!  I was skeptical because of the location, so don't let that throw you off!  We sat at the bar/lounge area during happy hour.  GREAT happy hour food menu and prices!  The bar area has a few different options that are not offered in the dining area such as the pig wings and half chicken.  The pig wings are AMAZING!!!  My husband is a huge food snob and also loved this place!  We want to go back for more pig wings!  The chicken was also amazing, the best chicken I have ever had!  We also had the filet sliders and they were great!!  The service was top notch!   We were very impressed with the entire experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Our waitress was so nice! She was so polite and quick to refil drinks. The food is out of this world and we will definitely be back for other celebrations :)"}
{"text":"Ahhhmazing place! We've only been once on Valentines Day a couple years back but it was really outstanding. Best steak my husband and I have ever had. We weren't sure about some of the appetizers so our server let us try them on the house. They were wonderful too. Such amazing food and a wonderful night."}
{"text":"We came here at the recommendation of friends and we were amazed at quality of the food and the service. We are currently planning a return for my daughter's birthday based on the tradition of \"choose the dinner for your birthday\" that we have adopted. 

I may be looking forward to her birthday more than she is."}
{"text":"The very best steakhouse in the entire Phoenix market, period.  From the cocktails, to the appetizers, to the ambiance and food service, this place is top notch...  Not to mention some of the best steakhouse menu I have ever eaten.

You'll pay a pretty penny here, but it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"What a wine dinner!  Simply fabulous at there monthly wine paired dinner. The Bordeaux wines were perfectly set against cheeses and meat courses. 
Thanks Mark"}
{"text":"In life, I don't think anything is perfect well...except perhaps the filet that I devoured at Arrowhead Grill may come pretty darn close! My experience was great from the beautiful and courteous hostess, great service, ambiance, wine and of course the main event; my filet. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants a casual but fine dining experience. The food was superb!"}
{"text":"KInd of like west side Mastros... service is very comfy, and the digs feel a little dated.. but the steaks are absoluty a bargain for the USDA prime quality... the sides, cream corn, augratin, twice baked.. rocked! desserts.. kind o mediocre... but a great step for west of the I17...HAZA!!!"}
{"text":"Overall dinner was amazing last night. But I don't get the 3 chops with lamb fondue normally would be ordered by 2 people and how to share such awesomeness. Our server lacked personality but the food top notch. 47 bucks for 3 martinis seemed a bit ridiculous however. But we will certainly keep going back"}
{"text":"This is an great steakhouse, the quality is on par with Ruth Chris, Morton's or Fleming's. The happy hour is excellent. If you are casual you can eat on the bar area but if you want a date night table you will want to make a reservation because it is as busy as the food is good."}
{"text":"My family goes to Arrowhead Grill all the time and we are always treated so well! We love the food and the happy hour is great!!"}
{"text":"Great place kid friendly but I would not bring the kids. Unless it was a special occasion it's pricy but worth every penny. The staff is great and they make sure your order is correct and to your expectation"}
{"text":"In town for the \"big game\" and we decided to search for a steakhouse in the area. Mark, our waiter, was very knowledgeable about the steaks and the menu. Appetizer we got the lamb chops...they were excellent. All 4 of us got the Bone In Rib-Eye. This was a very flavorful steak. 3/4 of the steaks were fatty, but you get that with a ribeye. The mashed potatoes and mac and cheese were great. The creamed spinach was more cream than spinach, but our waiter had no problem removing that from our bill. Wines were good. Excellent decor. They even give you a bottle of water to take home. I'd definitely go back if I was in town. This compared to the finer NY/NJ steakhouses. Dinner for 4 w/one bottle of wine, 2 appetizers and dessert came to around $400 total including tip."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been dining at Arrowhead Grill for several years now. In terms of more upscale dining in West Valley, they're one of the few options we have. And despite a few inconsistencies that pop up occasionally with food preparation and service, we both agree that they're usually on point.

Their signature steak is the Delmonico, which is very good, provided that the kitchen cooks it right. Their filet and salmon are also fine, given you're into fish. However, with the exception of specials, you'll mostly be ordering your AG food a la carte. They have a series of respectable sides, including their mac and cheese and AG mashed potatoes. 

Their salads are all standard-fare, with the exception of the slightly more expensive \"AG Salad,\" which has a wonderful inclusion of goat cheese crumbles, figs, dates, berries, and all kinds of awesome ingredients.

AG also offers a Thanksgiving meal that is usually pretty decent in quality. During our most recent visit, they seemed to really be slacking on quality and consistency in comparison to past years, but it usually satisfies and is typically above what competitors might serve for the holiday celebration.

As for their desserts, the butter cake is our absolute favorite! In fact, going to their dessert menu and ordering anything else except the butter cake is doing your party a huge dining disservice. Just be sure to request that it's warm/hot because it's not always guaranteed.

AG also offers special price fixe menus during holidays that often consist of three or four courses. It's usually a good deal, although they typically exclude some of their superior side options from the menu. If your server is nice, they'll make exceptions, but this appears to be based down to sheer luck. 

Reservations are recommended on the weekends for sure. It can be pricey (I'm sure made much worse if you drink alcohol). If you join their e-mail list, you'll receive the occasional discount offers and information about their specials - although it's usually wine-based stuff these days.

The restaurant can often be crowded, but has never once reached a point where I've found it loud and distracting. Service has always been fine and the food, although clearly not flawless, is usually decent enough.

On a good night and if the kitchen is firing on all cylinders, you're bound to get a spectacular meal. Although we've had occasional duds over the years, AG is still one of your better options for those who prefer avoiding all of the uninspiring steakhouse chains we have littered throughout Phoenix.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet up with friends for a happy hour outing or dining. The bar fills up fast so plan on getting there early if you can. You have got to try the Pig Wings. Trust me, they're terrific. The Moscow Mule (ginger infused cocktail served in a copper mug) is very tasty too. When (and if) it cools off, the patio is great place to hang out.
Service in both the bar and dining room is very good. The wait staff is very attentive without appearing to be badgering you. I've never experienced anything but the highest level of service. Their version of the Delmonico steak is about as good as you can get around the Phoenix area (without paying the ridiculous Ruth's Chris prices).
Be sure to sign up for their email list. They send out some pretty good specials from time to time."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to experience Arrowhead grill, which, I believe to be a hidden gem for steak. The service is better than excellent. The servers actually pay attention to you. Right away, you can tell that they are experienced and know what they are doing, which is refreshing.

The food is very good. I had the chef's steak, which was right around $25 and my GF had the lamb. They do family type sides. We got grilled mushrooms and mash potatoes. My mouth watered. We also got a bottle of wine. 

This place isn't cheap, so we don't come here very often, but when we do, we know that it is going to an awesome experience.  One time there was a problem with my meal and they immediately took care of it and credited my plate without me even saying a word. That is the kind of service that makes me keep coming back.

Give this place a try if you haven't, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely going try the cardinal sin next time.  It's a spicy cosmopolitan with jalapeño (no longer on the menu but a must try when here) only for those heat seekers.

And make sure to get Kasey who is a terrific bartender/server, he is fantastic.

Happy hour here is another reason this place rocks:  awesome food, fish tostadas, cheeseburger sliders- so good, very nice flavoring, pretzel fondue, AG burgers - yum!!, salmon or sirloin salad with your choice of chop or spinach or Caesar, lamb fondue..

Their butter cake- amazing, take a sample at the check in desk..

Dinner wise, the steaks and fish are cooked perfectly.

Drinks: red Manhattan, Cardinal sin(not on menu), house wines (all good) 

Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Where to start.? Ummm, lets start with service. Kind, knowledgeable and courteous. Ronnie, i've been a restaurant manager for over a decade and it makes me happy to leave 5 stars. Girl you killed it. Food, better than flemmings. Better than Mortons. Amazing simply amazing. Charles (manager) thank you for touching base and making sure it was a good night. It was our anniversary and dessert (on the house) was decadent. Everyone is so quick to smash businesses on yelp. It makes me happy to say this place was worth every star. Thank you Arrow Head Grille for a great night. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Save your pennies up and GO HERE!

We've been three times now & each time I've been reminded of the joy of dining. 

The lamb chop with goat cheese fondue is amazing. We shared a huge steak two of our visits which was prepared perfectly. Steak salad was great, smores dessert... it's all really well done (no pun intended.. especially cause we like meat rare). 

Service has been great as well. Friendly, attentive... like they know you're there for a $100+ meal & treat you accordingly.

Arrowhead Grill easily rivals any steak house I've been to in any major US or European city. 

Only downside is the cost... it ain't cheap. But you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. My last visit was not good at all...actually the past few visits were not impressive. We used to be greeted from all the bartenders and servers like neighbors, this time it was like we were shunned. My salmon was such a small portion for the $35 they charged me, my friends steak overcooked, not the first time, and they brought us our bill without us asking. It's too bad, because we enjoyed it for a long time and we live right down the road. Atmosphere is always good, just wish everything else flowed."}
{"text":"French onion soup, Delmonico steak, vegetable risotto, creme brulee were all delicious. Nice waitstaff. Professional chefs. Would go back any day. Love it."}
{"text":"This was an amazing restaurant equipped with the most mannerful experienced staff I have ever come across. I came here with my boyfriend based off of my friends referral and was NOT a disappointed. The food was flawless-which is hard for me to say considering I'm a good snob. The food would be considered pricy to some however I had no problem paying for my bill as I was overly impressed with how well I was treated and how the food was perfected. We met the owner and ripped handsomely as this place defiantly knows and understands good quality food, decor, service, generosity and even through in a free desert as our first time eating there. What makes it even better is the fact that they give you an emailing list set up and have already sent me a coupon which I will be using as soon as date nite comes around the corner. Fantastic. Impeccable. Exactly what I was wanting and expecting. YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"AG is the best place for a steak in the NW Valley, I have been here many times to enjoy the rib-eye and my wife usually gets the NY steak.  I love the seasoning choices and the sides are great as well, love the cream corn and cream spinach and my wife loves the asparagus.  I ordered fish once and didn't care for it much but the overall experience here is fantastic.  It is a great date night place and you can still go casual because in the NW valley we are not Scottsdale!  In the winter time they are open for lunch and the lunch items are great as well, not a cheap place for food but there is a reason for that.....this food is fanf*ckingtastic!  The atmosphere is upscale but not too fancy, its still in a strip mall area but we love this place and appreciate the good food and people.  They have a nice entrance, fire place inside and outside the bar area.  The bar is great which is where I was last night watching Monday night football with friends.  They have specials sometimes when you are on the email list and I ordered the AG burger which has prime rib slices on the burger with swiss cheese and comes with horseradish sauce (man was is awesome!).  The service is great and the deserts are awesome, I brought my kids here once and we ordered the smores and they brought out this chocolate bowl with a candle underneath to keep in warm and 4\" thick brownie size marshmallows to wrap gram crackers around, it was messy but my kids loved it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary with dinner at the Arrowhead Grill. We had a wonderful meal starting with the large spinach salad that is large enough to split. My husband had the Delmonico steak and I had a filet. The steaks were absolutely delicious, tender and perfectly cooked. Creamed spinach-best ever, loaded baked potato was also large enough to share. Dessert was butter cream cake- yummy!  The service was an A+. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I wish I could say this place was worth more then 3 stars, especially because it's one of the few nice steakhouses in the West Valley, but I've never had an all-around great meal. The service is normally good, but I don't like sitting in the bar area as that is where many of the servers tend to gather and socialize. 

They have a pretty decent happy hour with quite a few food options and the patio is great if it's not too hot out.

I've never had a bad steak and they do a tremendous filet mignon, but the sides are just mediocre. By now we've tried about 1/2 of them and none of them are worth what you get. They should consider cutting down on the amount of sides and perfecting them. Their desserts are pretty darn good and if you are celebrating, they typically bring you out a complimentary Butter Cake. It is excellent and this is coming from somebody who does not have a huge sweet tooth. 

Overall, great place, I plan on returning in the future!"}
{"text":"Love their tomahawk steak rib eye. And Charles is the best   To give you suggestions and what to try. Everything is delicious here. The clam chowder is the real deal full of clams and so creamy and the best in Arizona."}
{"text":"High quality and over all I had a good experience."}
{"text":"We arrived early for our reservations and were seated immediately which was good.  I agree with a fellow Yelper about the atmosphere being louder than expected but not sure they have much control over the conversation noise. Overall our booth was pleasant enough and we were able to hear and communicate effectively so the noise was not an issue.

Now to the food. We ordered the lamb chop fondue as an appetizer. The waiter described it as \"phenomenal\". We 100% agreed. It was amazing, or rather, \"phenomenal\"!!

The steak we ordered was the 14oz. Del Monico steak. (Described as a step below a filet for tenderness and a step below the ribeye in flavor, so the best of both worlds) We ordered it medium and Pittsburgh style which is sometimes difficult to prepare so we weren't surprised when it came out medium-rare. We sent it back and after a quick turn around on the grill the steak returned perfectly cooked! That was a little inconvenient as we had already started on our sides but they stayed warm until the steak arrived. Great char on the outside. It was tender, moist, and very flavorful!  We were very pleased despite the initial send back.

Sautéed mushrooms and onions were very good as were the AG mashed potatoes (loaded with cheese and bacon)!

Bottled beer only but they poured it in a glass for you and it was toof bustin' cold! (Which means ice cold, if you don't track the slang)

The waiter insisted on the butter cake and offered it on the house for the steak being initially undercooked. This seems a little inconsistent with the other yelpers review so I hope they have adopted this policy moving forward. Butter cake did not disappoint. It was amazing.

A must try if in the Glendale, Arizona area!

PS: I tried to do 41/2 stars but haven't figured it out yet so I gave them the benefit of the doubt with 5!!"}
{"text":"Yep, another incredible 5-star meal!  We decided to head over during Arizona Restaurant Week, and order off their special menu.

I ordered the chopped salad and prime rib, along with a side of sauteed broccoli (drenched in garlic and butter).  Hubby ordered the clam chowder and prime rib, with his side of mashed yukon potatoes.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  We have yet to have an issue with anything we've ordered here.

For dessert, there were 2 options, I got the single-sized buttercake and hubby got the flourless chocolate cake.  There wasn't a crumb left on either of our plates.

Our waiter, Charles, remembered us from the first time we ate here, which was really nice.  He was wonderful, and made sure everything was to our liking.  The additional waitstaff (the young man who brought our food and the young man who bussed our table), were also very professional and eager to help with smiles on their faces.

It was quite crowded for a late Sunday night dinner, but you never felt cramped or like there were a lot of people around.  I've found the dining room to be spacious and comfortable.  The booths provide some privacy, and even with a full restaurant, it never seemed too loud.

All in all, it was another wonderful experience, and we can't wait to come back, again."}
{"text":"A more upscale yet relaxed steakhouse. The husband and I ordered different cuts of steak, both medium rare. They were full of flavor and properly cooked through-out. The meal was enjoyed with a glass of red wine recommended by the waiter."}
{"text":"Great dinner. Wonderful calamari, 50% off on wines on Wednesday nights! Great service!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place. Wonderful ambience.  Fantastic food. Our waiter Jerry was amazing. These guys have got it going on. Come here for a special occasion or just a great night out. Combining such good food with unparalleled awesome service like Jerry make for an unforgettable experience. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"The food and service is above and beyond! The only thing better than the Steak is the butter cake for dessert. I've come here twice for my birthday and have never been let down. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Arrowhead Grill is definitely more upscale than anything else in the area but the ambience and quality of the food justifies the price. The happy hour is wonderful value and good enough to never go during regular hours, to be honest.

The only downside of this place is that my wife and I (in our 20s) felt like the youngest people in the restaurant by at least 20 years. However, that's probably more to do with the part of town than the restaurant itself. We live a mile away and it's not enough to keep us from returning.

The staff are friendly and the service is what you'd expect from a restaurant of this type. 

I would urge you to check out happy hour. It's perfect for an early date or to grab a drink and a bite to eat after work."}
{"text":"I came in for the first time a week ago.  We weren't dressed to impress because my boyfriend and I had never been here before. I'm not sure if this was a reflection on our waitress but she gave us terrible service.  She spent more time attending to the group of males in suits than to my boyfriend and me.  We were there for a long time before she even took out sink order.  My boyfriend was drinking beer and it was like pulling teeth for him to get a refill.  
The food was really great.  I recommend the bone in fillet or the chicken.  Both are great. The AG mashed potatoes are like a twice baked potato that is super yummy.  I really enjoyed the sautéed asparagus too. They were crisp and buttery.  
I took my parents to this restaurant a few days ago.  The food was still delicious but the wait staff was very slow.  
I think the wait staff is my only complaint about this place.  The food is really good. Oh and the cheesecake was delicious too."}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended while we were visiting Arizona and it lived up to our expectations! Staff including Jessica, our server, were extremely helpful. The food was fantastic from the appetizers to the filet. Management went out of their way to make us feel at home. I would highly recommend Arrowhead Grill to our friends and family!"}
{"text":"I have never had steak this good in my entire life! I had the 10 oz Delmonico steak. Mio dio. My dad had the coby and man, that was some damn good steak. I would honestly prefer this place over Flemings or any other steakhouse. And their butter cake. Don't even get me started! I haven't had food that great in a while! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! The happy hour is amazing and the food is super yummy. During happy hour the bar menu is 50% off and the Pig Wings are a must have :)"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it won't be our last. This place was amazing. The customer service was top notch! The steak was the best we have ever had. You have to try the butter cake! They found out it was our first time here and brought it out for free. It's not cheap, but the atmosphere, food and service was well worth it. 

Next time we will get a reservation for a table though. We sat in the bar and the tables and people were just a little too close together. And sitting by a party of 6 is never quiet. I was close enough to learn that they only get out once every couple months since they can't find good baby sitters. They also like to stalk people on Facebook. It was a little entertaining and annoying at the same time. And I can't forgot the 50-something year old couple at the bar who were displaying some serious PDA. Pretty sure they just connected on Tinder."}
{"text":"arrowhead grill is the only non-chain steakhouse in the west valley. it is a perfect spot for a real martini and a great delmonico steak. they have awesome specials almost everyday so call to ask or join the email list. recently they have had buy one get one free burgers, filets, delmonicos, prime rib, king crab legs.....definetly worth siging up for. they do bar specials during most sports games (suns, cardinals, coyotes) great alternative to boring bar food."}
{"text":"Again disappointed with staff. Our friends surprised me with a cake for birthday 6 of us at table she brings 6 spoons no plates. My friend asked for plates waitress asked how many. She's been waiting on us for an an hour and a half and then doesn't know to bring six plates  she brought 5 then cops an attitude when we asked for another plate and complains to other servers and the owner while we're still sitting there and can see and hear her never complain about the customer when they are in your ear shot or eye shot.
The customer in my opinion is not always right but in my opinion here she was wrong and rude then would not bring the check back she gave it to the owner to bring."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar for the Happy Hour menu. Yummy....best bleu cheese burgers. The bartenders were cheerful and accommodating. It was our 1st time eating here, but I had seen it close by to where we live and then saw the reviews on Yelp, only positive! Thanks for pointing us in the right direction."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a number of times since it is in my neighborhood.  When I first started going everything was excellant.  But, as time has gone on the experience is less and less satisfying.  My last visit was Sat. night.  The noise level was extreme.  The service was shaky at best.  In all fairness it was busy when we first arrived but it cleared out by about 8 and the service was worse.  We watched our waiter visiting with other employees but didn't see him refill drinks,  Delmonico steaks were perfectly cooked and served hot.  Sides were not as hot.  Flourless cake billed as warm showed up straight out of the frig.  The prices here are not cheap.  You expect a great experience.  Don't know if we will try again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant for an expensive vacation from life!  The Lobster Mac N Cheese is heaven!  The portions are giant on everything so two people can share and get out for $100.  It's the perfect romantic date restaurant.  
The lamb comes on a giant bone that's 16 inches long and the presentation is perfect.  Order that and be prepared to feel like Fred Flintstone!"}
{"text":"Great food I really enjoy the Delmonico Steak. Had it on Monday and back on Wednesday. The king crab appetizer is also great."}
{"text":"Came to Arrowhead Grill for Mother's Day 2010. It was a great experience. 

It was a price fixe menu. We had 5 people in our party and our Mom doesn't eat that much food, so they let us order 4 price fixe menu items and brought my Mom out an extra plate to share from us. Very accommodating. 

Good service and friendly wait staff. The owner even came over and checked on us. 

The Butter Cake dessert was fantastic! I highly recommend it. Although it does take about 20 minutes for the cake to come out. I think our server forgot to mention that. 

I have been here for dinner as well. Their sides and fish are excellent. 

We will definitely be back. They gave our Mom a 20 dollar gift card to use. Wohoo! Can't wait."}
{"text":"Great service every time I come in! A little pricey but worth it for the level of service and quality of food. Great happy hour options in the bar too!"}
{"text":"We went to Arrowhead Grill on a Friday night and had an awesome time! There were four of us and we all Loved our meals and the service was excellent, which is why I decided to write a review as most are negative for this establishment. I had fish which was a recommendation of our server, it was perfect. My Husband got a steak which was also delicious and prepared to perfection. We ordered the asparagus and potatoes for our side dishes and a salad. They complimented our meals perfectly. Our friends got taco's and steak and loved their choices as well. We shared a bottle of wine and enjoyed a fabulous evening. We will definitely be returning, it is a bit pricey but hey, you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"The Delmonico was fantastic!!! Brussel sprouts delish! And don't even get me started about the butter cake. New favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food again, BUT....  Took friends there to celebrate a retirement.  1st time for four in our party of 6.  Happy hour is very popular, so we went to the bar to get happy hour pricing while we waited for dinner.  The happy hour gives you $2 off, so you might well wait for dinner.  One party left after waiting 45 minutes for a seat in the bar.  Things started off ok with the server, but there was a definite attitude change as the night went on.  He wasn't as friendly to our all female table as he was to other tables.  When asked how everything was, we told a manager we wanted more drinks.  I watched as the server defending his lack of service to the manager.  As we closed down the evening, he stared at our table as he polished glasses, eventually coming to the table to take unused glasses away.  I was embarrassed by the service, so I ended our night.  There were no parties waiting for a seat, so his behavior was uncalled for.  You expect 5 star service to accompany 5 star pricing.  This is the first bad experience I've had at the place.  Ask for a manager if you have problems, I wish I had."}
{"text":"I've eaten at most fine steak houses in Phoenix and Las Vegas. Cut, SW, Maestros, and many more. AG continually has the best food and service of anywhere I've ever eaten. 

In addition to their amazing restaurant their bar food is amazing. The green beans and pig wings are to die for. Best buttercake in the world. Do not miss."}
{"text":"Charles ( our waiter ) took really good care of us by listening to our likes and found menu items that satisfied  our urges. He could not have done a better job pairing our wines with our entrees. A true gentleman , thank you!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!
Ate there for mothers day and when we sat down everything seemed pretty good. They took our appetizer orders then those orders came out. After we were finished with our appetizers the waitress came back to finally take our orders. I ordered Prime rib and it was great. My mother had the Delmonico and it was very salty. but the one my brothers girlfriend ordered was just right. My mother complained and they cooked her another one. By the time her new order came out were were all finished with our dinners. Her new Delmonico steak had no seasoning and was dry. The manager not once checked on us to see if anything was okay or if we needed anything. The service overall was just slow and very forgetful. It took them over 15 minutes just to get bread and refills. 
Not recommended to eat there."}
{"text":"This is one of the best steakhouses in the west valley! 

The atmosphere isn't as upscale as some other steakhouses - definitely casual, but it's a little warmer and friendlier than some I've been to.

The complimentary breads always come out warm and fresh. I get the filet when I come; it's tender, has a good flavor, and not too salty! I don't recommend getting oscar style here, it wasn't much crab and it didn't add a lot to the steak. (If you want oscar style then ocean club does it better -IMHO). The sides are middle of the road, nothing special, but the prices are much cheaper than your typical steakhouse, so I think it's fair! Although, I generally skip the sides when I go to arrowhead and get a salad instead. 

Arrowhead also offers a nice happy hour and bar menu. The bar staff is always very friendly and a lot of fun to spend your happy hour with! They have very tasty filet sliders and crab cake sliders... Mmmmmm! Plus, I do love their moscow mules and pear Martinis!

Overall, I would recommend"}
{"text":"We go quite frequently to the Arrowhead Grill - food is excellent, service is better.  I often host work events there and will do it again.  Love the mac N cheese and all of the steaks are excellent. It can be a bit pricy but worth it!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation via Open Table and were seated immediately.  Front desk very friendly.  Waitress, Jessica, immediately took drink orders. She was super friendly and we were looking forward to an enjoyable evening.  Then it happened, Jessica was leaving early and turned us over to Mark.  From that point on we were treated like step-children.  Twice he \"forgot\" to bring us bread.  Mark was almost non-existent.  We were serviced more by the bus boy, Peyton, who was far more adept at customer service than Mark.  The atmosphere was a bit louder than expected but we could still hold conversation.  We had indicated a birthday, which Mark also ignored until it was called to his attention.  I sound negative but I just think when you
are paying prime dollars for dinner you should expect a certain level of service.  Which I must add - a 20% gratuity was automatically added and then the check shows up with a Tip Line.  I don't think so. 

I find it hard to recommend this place if you are expecting to be treated with respect and have a fairly pleasant evening.  Too many issues and reading Yelper inputs, this is a constant problem.  No one seems to care."}
{"text":"I had high hopes... The AG entry was beautifully decorated, but as you walk in to the dining room it became very simple. It is dark with a romantic feel. It's not very big either. 

Bottom line for what we paid, I want to feel like a fat, happy princess. 

Shrimp cocktail app was presented beautifully (over dry ice). The 3 shrimp were huge and very good, but if you have 4 people you can add another one? $16.99 plus $5.50 that's expensive in my book. 

The steaks were good and I recommend that if you are a Med rare person order it rare plus as it is served on a 400 degree plate and keeps cooking. The steaks had a nice flavor. 

The sides are all ala carte. The AG potatoes were very good, green beans also nice. My daughter who ordered off the kids menu wanted a little side of steamed broccoli, most places are accommodating to this, but we were charged the full $8.99. That was about the same as her meal. 

The specialty drink list was cool. The wine list in a Steak House should \"wow\" you... No I was not impressed. 

Service was so mediocre! Not at all what my bill demanded. 

Many reviews compare AG to Flemings, and I eat there all the time along with many other upscale steakhouses. Folks this is not in the same league. You ask why not 2 stars well the food did taste good and I'm on vacation so I'm more laid back."}
{"text":"I had this restaurant bookmarked for over two months. I finally got some folks to go with me. Everything was horrible. I ordered my steak medium rare but it came out medium well. The manager came out to argue with me to say it was exactly how I ordered it when it clearly was not. He had me walk with him over into the dining room to show me what it looked like under different lighting. As though that would change the temperature, texture, and overall taste of my steak.  He then ordered me a replacement which came back extremely under cooked and cold. I advised the waitress that I expected her to take everything off of the menu. I guess they didn't take the onion rings off because I had a couple. Fine. Whatever. I will never go back to this nightmare horrific restaurant ever again. I have called the general manager Mark. I will advise you what I hear.  The photo I am attaching is from the replacement that he tried to bring back to me that was completely covered with uncooked fat and cold."}
{"text":"I would have to say the Arrowhead Grill is possibly the best dining in the West Valley.  Don't let the location (in a small strip mall) stop you from visiting.  Once you walk through the door the dark wood and booths take you to that steakhouse level.  Our Delmonico steaks were so tender and full of flavor.  Caesar salads wonderful.  And the complimentary bread assortment was excellent.  We were too full for dessert.  I would have loved to try the Butter Cake.  Next time for sure.

Make a reservation.  It was Saturday night and the place was packed but the service was spot on."}
{"text":"Been here few times for the prime rib special. Great price for the three courses and the prime rib we got this last visit were flavorful, nice & thick and cooked just the way we wanted. Staff were friendly and service was prompt. 
As for dessert, i tried majority of dessert options- personally would not recommend key lime pie. My favorites are strawberry fondue and the cheesecake. 
one of my favorite places in Phoenix area to go for prime rib and rack of lamb"}
{"text":"5 out of 5 for food presentation alone. I had THE best steak I've ever had in my life. It's pricey (about $60 pp) but the food is amazing. Great for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Best Steakhouse on the west side! Love this place, service is excellent, the staff goes above and beyond to make you feel special, been there a lot of times, specially after the Cardinals games, those Cardinal Sins martinis are a must! Food is just amazing and we are always happy with our experience and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very good food, completely amazing to be more correct. It was pricey and I didn't dig that everything is al a carte but the food made up for any grievance. The service wasn't exactly fast but I was catching up with a friend so enjoyed not feeling pressured out. It's a great place for a special night out."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here just the other day. The resturaunt was really nice and me and him didn't make reservations so we ended up siding in the bar area. Surprisingly the service was still pretty great. It was definitely busy because it was a weekend night. Our server was a delight. She knew the menu and answered all the questions that I had. I got the Wild Salmon ($32) which was fantastic. It literally melted in my mouth. My boyfriend got the swordfish (about $30 as well). I tried it and it was different... But it was Still really good. We got 3 sides: mashed potatoes, macaroni and the steamed broccoli which were all good. And we both got a beer. I had seen reviews before we came here so I knew I had to try the Butter Cake and it was AMAZING.. I would go there again just for that. But our bill came out to be about $145 including the tip... So go here on a special occasion if you can't afford such an expensive dinner on the regular.. The food was great.. But the service really made this place what it is."}
{"text":"We ate here as part of a large party in the private dining room. We didn't have the full menu available, but the smaller menu still offered an impressive variety of choices. The service was top-notch throughout our dinner.

The appetizer offerings included calamari, pretzel sticks with fondue, and coconut shrimp. The shrimp was incredible--meaty, perfectly crispy, and just plain divine. The pretzel breadsticks were large and thick and cut into thirds; the bread texture was perfect, and I say that as a home bread baker who is particular about such things. On that note, the bread baskets they set on the table also offered a good variety; I especially liked the rosemary focaccia.

Salads came out next. I had a small chopped salad, which was tasty, though quite heavily dressed.

By the reactions around me, everyone enjoyed the main courses. My husband had the 22-ounce ribeye, which was about the size of a platter. He thought it was excellent. Others praised the lamb and the 8-ounce filet. I had the braised salmon. It was impressive in size and perfectly cooked. I had asparagus on the side; it was cooked well, mostly crisp and not mushy. Butter seems to be their favorite seasoning here! Other people with me engaged in some debate about the mashed potatoes and their savory flavor. Apparently, they add sour cream to make the potatoes thick and creamy. In the sample I had, I thought it worked well, but I can understand why purists wouldn't like that addition.

Then came the desserts. Oh boy. I had the flourless chocolate cake. My piece was small, which was fine by me because it was incredibly rich and I was about ready to explode like a pinata, anyway. My husband had the creme brulee and enjoyed it, though he wished that coffee had been offered along with it.

I had a margarita and it was tasty. They didn't skimp on the alcohol, either!

In all, we had a wonderful time there, and this is someplace we'd definitely like to return to for a date night at some point."}
{"text":"We have been there in the past for brunch and lunch and really liked it. The service was good,friendly,informative.  Food was very good. Concept was very upscale and classy but in a casual atmosphere.  Unfortunately,they stopped serving lunch,so I don't know what they are like right now. The dinner menu is more upscale than I remember."}
{"text":"This place was great few months back. They had an amazing staff, little by little they are all leaving due to owners yelling screaming and controlling behavior.  We used to be regulars, I think the success got to the owners head, who likes to be called \"The Chef\".  Unfortunately last few times, we have been there the service hasn't been so good.  We need another high end steak house in Peoria."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal.  I absolutely loved my steak (filet mignon).  It was cooked and seasoned perfectly (rare).  My wife had the same steak, but she thought they used too much salt.  So much so that she tried scraping off the seasoning.  

The happy hour specials are pretty good.  This place is rather expensive, so any discount is a good thing.  If you can hit the happy hour of an appetizer and a glass of wine before dinner...I would highly suggest it.  You can take your wine to your table with you."}
{"text":"The steaks at Arrowhead Grill are top notch! Celebrating our 5 year anniversary with family, the service was great and the food was filling and well worth it. I liked the family style sides which were all pretty good such as green beans, truffle cauliflower and grilled artichokes. I had a 8oz filet Mignon, it was buttery and spiced well, and a nice glass of red wine.  Yum! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I had a completely horrid meal! I got the AG Salmon it was disgusting! The salmon was complexity raw in the center. I sent it back twice and it still was raw in the center. Finally i gave up and just pushed the raw salmon away. The customer service was great! They apologized and took the salmon off the tap but in the end we just went across the street to Wendy's for food."}
{"text":"I loved it here, until I had mastros and Durants. The service is really hit or miss, the steaks are good but not superb. The one thing my husband and I really like here is the pretzel fondue. The rest is just so-so. I come here if I can't make a reservation elsewhere. Good but not great. Oh, I did like the key lime pie here though."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant for special occasion or just a Friday night! Atmosphere is perfect, quiet and spacious. Steak and lobster we're awesome. Plenty of food and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My Husband and I enjoyed a Thanksgiving dinner to die for. The macadamia nut encrusted Sea Bass was spectacular. The Turducken was marvelous. Our waitress was top notch and we will definitely be visiting Arrowhead Grill in the near future."}
{"text":"My husbands family came out from SoCal for 1 night to visit my dad who recently got ill.  Wanted to take them out for a \"nice\" meal.  My dad and brother have been here multiple times and said it was good.  Unfortunately this experience was bad all around.  The food was way too salty( even after I requested low sodium)and the service was neglectful.  Had to hunt down waiter 2 times during meal once to put in our order and another to see why the food was taking so long.  
 My brother requested bread 3 times before getting any and the kids were hungry it was over an hour and we still hadn't gotten our appetizers.  I see the other big party that came in after us start receiving their entree's.   I went to the first person I could find and he said he would find my waiter.  The waiter comes by about 8 mins later and instead of apologizing for the wait he says your food is coming out right now. 
The calimari came out lukewarm and a little soggy.  The mains came out shortly after the appetizers so I'm pretty sure everything was ready before hand and sitting there waiting to be served until I said something. 
First bite of my New York was super salty which I said out loud and it was a bit over cooked.  The waiter over heard me and stopped to say, but I told them low sodium.  That was about all he said before he walked away.
A manager came by to check on us and I had to tell him I wasn't happy.  I told him about the calamari and told him to take it away and told him to take my steak away as well.  He did offer to recook the food, but I told him I didn't have time for that because by that point it was over 2 hours since we sat down and we had to get my dad home he was tired and we needed to go home to start his treatment.  
Everyone else was hungry so they just said it was ok, but just kept commenting on how salty their food was.  Nobody touched any of the sides we ordered either because they were salty.  My nephew asked for his steak well done and my brother said it was so hard that he had trouble cutting it for him.  I see my dad put pieces of steak in his mouth and spat out each piece of his prime rib because it was so tough I don't really think he even ate his food.  My father in law cut most of his steak off to give everyone else because he said it was too salty for him and he was left to naw on his ribeye bone.  Then my sister in law when we got home told me her sea bass was so salty she kept drinking water to the point were she had to go to the bathroom 5 times and she kinda had a headache.  Also my other nephew ordered chicken fingers and he said it was dry.  I think my daughter who is 4 was the only one that liked her food and she got Mac and cheese.  They somehow messed up and thought my mom ordered a Delmonico steak too.  Which is funny because she doesn't eat beef.
I ask for the check and to add insult to injury they tacked on a 20%sc.   I handed them my card and I didn't notice my mom switch out my card for hers and when I found out she paid for it I think I just saw red maybe because I made the reservations and felt responsible for subjugating my family to such a bad experience and felt horrible that my mom paid for it and all she ate was a clam chowder.  I stormed out the room and ask for a manager.  I yelled at the manager about how they should be ashamed of themselves for charging 20% sc for crap food and service!  
I've never done that at a restaurant before and honestly I usually always tip20-25%.  To their credit they did take off my steak and the calamari, but it's just a slap in the face when they make you pay 20% because they say it's their policy for large groups even though they know your not happy with the service.  
So anyways I storm out of the restaurant and maybe it was a little rude of me so I am sorry for telling a bunch of waiters who where all staring at me storming off that they should be ashamed of themselves!  Also outside of the restaurant the manager did apologize and asked me how he could make it right and I told him I was not happy that they charged 20%sc and so he asked me if I wanted it all back.  I told him no just give the waiter 10%. Which was still very generous for the service we got.  
I also apologize to the other manager(this was a different one than the one that spoke to me outside, probably didn't want to deal with me because I yelled at him).  The manager gave me the extra tip and I handed over to my mother which made me feel a Little better,  but still not happy that she ended up paying over $600 for inedible food and sub par service.  I guess at the end of the day our family will never return to this restaurant which I'm sure they really don't care either.  
Sadly when I went home I ended up eating the left over steak my brother had made for Christmas 3 days prior and it was so much better than what they tried to serve me."}
{"text":"AG is always great. We are here all the time and the food and service are always consistent."}
{"text":"If you want attentive service, high quality food & drinks, and servers who can make solid recommendations, AG is a great choice! Their happy hours are phenom, lots of options & \"wine down Wednesdays\" = 1/2 price bottles! They have a wine tasting monthly on Saturdays, last week maybe, and that is a great value & experience.  Crowd is \"mature\" but as a late 30something, we enjoy the environment & experience! Cheers, we'll be back many more times!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a casual happy hour but lounge was jam packed. Ended up in the dining room. Server JERRY was absolutely fantastic. Great service 110%. We shared bone-in ribeye done medium rare and cooked perfectly - served on a very hot plate. Also shared a loaded baked potato with condiments on the side, and roasted Brussels sprouts. Kitchen split everything for us. Two managers stopped by to make sure we were happy (we were). Jerry sent over \"Butter cake\", a house specialty for dessert. Kind of an accidental find but we would highly recommend and would definitely go back. Old school vibe. High end prices. Very solid."}
{"text":"I love this place. Excellent service. We had the fillet mignon cooked exactly as ordered. Excellent wine choice . Dessert was crime brûlée and chocolate fondue. Both scrumptious. On the expensive side but worthed. It does get busy so call ahead and make a reservation."}
{"text":"Pricey but food is way above average. Steak was perfect and sides delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I split a large Caesar salad. We could have done a small as the portions are quite large. We then each had the Delmonico steak with sauteed broccoli and sauteed mushroom with onions. Again we split these as they were more than big enough to do so. Everything was amazing! The steak was cooked medium rare just to my liking. The cut of meat was superb. It was a  melt in your mouth experience."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Jessica was a busy bee with doing something as small as getting a new glass of water without lemon for my daughter quickly and politely. As soon as we sat down she said waters were on there way before we ordered anything. To me, I knew it would be great service because we always get waters to begin with and it should really be given without asking at any sitdown restaurant and many don't. We had many others from the staff that would jump in and fill in for anything else that was needed.

For those thinking of bringing their kids I say go ahead because they have a kids menu and they were very patient with ours who are 11 and 7. Yes, the bill was astronomical and something like mushrooms and onions are something that is not necessary to pay as we did but, to me, they are a must with steak. We had perfect, to our liking, delmonico steak and prime rib (comes with two types of horseradish) along with the lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus. I have to say that they do not scrimp on the lobster in the mashed potatoes. Every bite had a good chunk of lobster and I seriously just sat there and looked off into space with every bite. It was our first time there and we were there to celebrate Father's Day a little early so they gave us a butter cake on the house which was really awesome. So thank you AG for a wonderful experience. We will come again but probably when we have a really special occasion."}
{"text":"Awesome clam chowder (New England style ) and the best lamb chop fondue I have ever had. It was to die for. My coconut shrimp was a little overdone but my husband had the prime rib and loved it but not as much as the lamp chop fondue."}
{"text":"Went to AG for the first time , we are new to this part of town and wanted to take Mother in law from the U.K. out for her bday dinner. My initial impression was not what we expected . This was supposed to be a fine dining restaurant but yet there was sports TV goin on right from the entry. The tables were so close together it was like dining with strangers in your party too loud to have a conversation without leaning forwards half across the table .  They don't know anything about the wines they serve . The good part of this dining experience was the food was good but hello it's not that posh to have to order your sides separate from your entree like Mastros . For the money I would have driven to Sassi Scottsdale for an amazing meal , unique exquisite architecture and left you feeling like a star. They have a great knowledge of the wines they serve and the staff can really explain what they are serving. In future I will take the little farther drive to Sassi."}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday and everything was wonderful! Started off with drinks, I had the Peartini ,which was delish, and my friend had the AG Mule, which he enjoyed very much. We skipped appetizers and salads and ordered filets with the cognac pepper corn sauce. Since the sides are ala carte and enough for 2-3 people, we shared the green beans and the AG mashed potatoes, both were very delicious. The steaks were so good and the sauce was a great complement. For my friend's birthday they brought out their house butter cake topped with a dash of ice cream on a plate that spelled out Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce, needless to say it was quite good! The service was impeccable and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Quite simply this is the best restaurant on this side of town. My wife and I have eaten here on numerous occasions. I have never had a bad meal or poor service. Cocktails are great, appetizers are great and dinner never fails to impress. Having eaten at Flemmings, Dominick's, The Ocean Club etc. this place is hands down one of my favorites. The Delmonico Steak, the creamed corn, brussel sprouts and my god the butter cake.I highly recommend if you are looking for an amazing meal, make a reservation. I have to say that one time they were booked pretty heavily and due to my hem-hawing I didn't get a reservation so we just went to Prestons which is equally as good.Every time we leave I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This is place is very classy, great for the family and kids. My wife really loves this place. A definite must for a Friday night out."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for mothers day dinner. She ordered the Delmonico Steak and it came out very salty, we sent it back and 25 mins later they brought back another one that was bland and over cooked. The manager passed by our table many times and did not even say a word. As we were leaving he was standing by the bar and saw us approaching and he walked away. Service was terrible but majority of the food was great. But for the price you're paying you expect better service. Since they messed up my mom's food you would think they would comp her but they didn't. Some prices on the menu also didn't match the price on the bill."}
{"text":"This place is great.  We've been several times for drinks and dessert and once for dinner and always had a tasty and relaxing experience.  Great food, great service, great wine and drinks, I definitely recommend.  If you go here, plan to indulge and spend money but it's worth it."}
{"text":"It was awful tonight! Great servers worst manager ever, after 5 years three meals a week he doesn't  have a clue who we are. This place has excellent food! Tonight was a complete fail! Management should of taken control. I was completely discussed by how things were handled."}
{"text":"Seriously better then any major Steak house in AZ. I think it's better then Fleming's, better then Don & Charlie's, better then Capital Grill. I have one of two things when I come here....their Prime Rib or the famous TOMAHAWK BONE-IN RIBEYE STEAK enough for two people to share, this thing is huge and super tender seasoned & cooked to perfection. The sides I would have to say blow me away must get the CREAMED CORN, MUSHROOMS & ONIONS, ARTISAN MAC&CHEESE. Save room for dessert...without a doubt get the Signature Arrowhead Grill BUTTER CAKE...you won't be sorry. Come hungry cuz it's a lot of food! Hidden gem on the West Side."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Everything we ordered was perfectly prepared. The Delmonico streak was great but even better was the Prime Rib. Best I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"No complaints here! I reserved via Open Table, got there and was seated within 3 minutes. Our service was spectacular throughout from beginning to end. The food and drinks were on the higher end; however you can tell that this is a higher end restaurant and with that you expect to pay. No complaints here though because the 10 oz Delmonico  Steak & Louisiana style BBQ Shrimp. The meat was cooked medium rare and overall this plate was spectacular. Excellent presentation, perfectly cooked food. It was also my 3 year anniversary with my fiance and our waiter even went the extra mile and provided us a cake and ice cream. It's these little things that truly made our experience perfect! Thank you Arrowhead Grill for the outstanding service and food. We will be sure to come back many times over.  A+++"}
{"text":"The food is hot and delicious.  The menu is nothing incredibly creative but it all looks and tastes right.  Many places have way too much salt in their food, these folks understand that quality ingredients do not need salt to mask the natural flavors.  Cocktails are a bit pricey but have a good amount of alcohol in them.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are great but the Delmonico steak is excellent! A little pricey but worth it for a treat."}
{"text":"5 stars for happy hour, oddly posted picture and forgot to check in.  House wines are delicious and very reasonable priced.  Appetizers are on sale and so worth it, again reasonable priced for locale. The bread pretzel with dip is one of the better ones, also the sliders are delicious."}
{"text":"If you want the snobby style, head east. Otherwise, sit down and enjoy some delicious food!! My wife and I have gone many times, and never had a complaint. It's interesting to see the bad reviews. I can't identify with those, but I can tell you the food is great. Their servers and bussers are top notch, nice, friendly and attentive. Yeah, it's a little crowded sometimes. And it can get loud, but that's what's great. It's not stuffy in there. No one cares, you have a shirt and sandals? No problem. Your in your Sunday best? Come on in. Eat some great food, and prepare to be taken care of. The manager has always come by to check on us, and I'm not famous. Give it a try. I bet your more likely to have an experience like mine than not."}
{"text":"So delicious! My husband and I have driven an hour an a half twice to eat here and it's well worth it. You must try the Delmonico steak. It's as tender as a filet and the most tasty steak you'll ever eat. The chefs know how to cook the steaks perfectly as requested and it was one of the most visually appealing steaks I've ever ate. Add Oscar style and you'll be in heaven. 
Caesar salad was garlicky but delicious. We have tried the lobster mash (full of lobster!), creamed spinach, and artisan Mac n cheese. Dessert. We have tried the s'mores. Which were messy but yummy and the creme brûlée. Again. Amazing. 
There wasn't one thing I was unhappy with with both meals we have had there. Service is great.  You would never think from the outside, the inside would have such high quality food. Skip outback and pay a little extra on dinner here. It's well worth it."}
{"text":"We really only have eaten in the bar area.  The servers are nice but food has come out very slow a couple of times we've been there.  But the food itself is pretty good."}
{"text":"Had dinner here 5/17.  They had a very good wine list and Wednesdays are Wine Down Wednesday where bottles of less than $106 are half price.  The food was excellent and our server was very attentive, even getting the chocolate martini recipe from the bartender for my dinner guest."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE ATMOSPHERE

The restaurant has 2 outdoor patios.  The back patio is on Union Hills and is incredibly loud.  The front patio is against the entrance where patrons entering/exiting stare at your food.

I do NOT recommend for this place for a date."}
{"text":"Started out with the Perfect Patron Margarita which was perfect. The Delmonico steak was done to perfection. It was do tender and flavorful. Our waiter Casey suggested a peppercorn sauce which put the flavor over the edge. They had a special veggie of the day which was roasted Brussels sprouts that made this meal complete. Casey then brought us a dessert which was a yellow cake served warm with vanilla ice cream on top served with coffee and Bailey's on the side. This topped off a wonderful savory dinner. Best of the best steak houses on the west side."}
{"text":"It was a terrible experience tonight, I usually have an amazing time at this place but the Gm decided to be an idiot tonight.  Oh well , love you AHG"}
{"text":"Very nice place, definitely the best restaurant in the northwest valley. The service is usually very good. Their steaks are top notch and the wine selection is fabulous. The ambience is not the greatest, and the tables can be quite close. Parking can also be a challenge, and valet is not offered. However, it is still a very nice restaurant if you are someone who is willing to pay for a quality meal. If you go, you must finish your meal with the butterscotch cake!"}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say other than if your on the west side and looking to really enjoy a meal, this is the spot.  We started off on tue happy hour menu that lead into the dinner menu and dessert .  No thing was disappointing and if you leave without tasting the butter cake you missed out.  Steve our server was awesome.  Must try is also the Lobster bake potato which was delish."}
{"text":"We recently ate here and were super impressed with our dinner as well as the Wed. night half priced wine special for wines under $100. Great deal! We ordered the oysters (Kumamoto) and they were fresh, briny, and perfect. I ordered the petite filet and it was divine and cooked to a perfect medium rare. It seriously might have been the best steak I've ever had. I ordered my steak oscar style and while the bearnaise sauce was lovely the crab cake was not great. It tasted kind of bland and didn't have a great consistency. My husband ordered the Delmonico and the AG mashed potatoes. Both were really good. Short story skip the $16 add on for the oscar style and get the sides of the sauce and veg."}
{"text":"First time at this place and disappointment! Went to happy hour and ordered house drink of gin on rocks and menu said 5.99. When we received the bill, the charge was 7.99. Confronted our server and she said the additional charge was for on the rocks. That is insane! Bait and switch. Never offered to adjust bill. Had a fair steak and twice baked potato! For the cost, go to Steak 44! No comparison in food quality and service."}
{"text":"Recently Moved here from TX , and took my wife here for her Birthday not really knowing what I was getting into . This place definitely exceeded my expectations from the reviews online . 

Our Server Joe was top notch , and made our experience more enjoyable. 

It's a nice place for a dinner date . We sat outside in the patio with cold weather and we were beyond comfortable and warm ."}
{"text":"Game here before going to the Cirque show.  Sat at the bar since we didn't have reservations for a Saturday night and we didn't have trouble finding a table.  There are ample TV's with sports on each station.  I was happy they had the EuroCup but was quickly disappointed when they changed the channel on the big TV to watch hockey.  What gives?  

Anyways, the service was fine.  The food was good.  I had the spring salad and my friend had the prime rib which was cooked just right.  I wasn't blown away and I wasn't disappointed.  The drinks were stiff so that was a nice touch. 

Bottom line: I mean, it's a nice place."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious -- my caesar salad delisch and so large! Filet mignon was done to perfection and it had some rub on it that tasted very good. My friend had salmon and raved about it. Great place with Kobe beef!"}
{"text":"The food was Really good but very over priced! You have to pay extra for sides snd the portions are not very big for the price your paying"}
{"text":"We had the most enjoyable time, delicious meal and outstanding service. Everything from the drinks, appetizer, main course, sides and deserts - all were flavorful and balanced. The service was exceptional - thank you Ronnie! I cannot believe we have been in this area for several years and have never tried it... We have always been Flemings fans, but Arrowhead Grill has surpassed our longtime favorite by providing the complete package. The patio is a beautiful place to dine, and does not have the feel of being close to such a busy street. We would highly recommend this restaurant! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent steaks.  Great service. We had asparagus spears that were grilled perfectly. Defiantly get the seafood add on. The staff were attentive and friendly.  The manager was extremely helpful and professional. Made us feel special.   Defiantly would go back."}
{"text":"So we showed up when it opens at 3 PM and it was already crowded, there were a couple seats at the bar and we had some outstanding appetizers and a great bartender. Pig wings were surprisingly good, and so were the lamb lollipops with the fondue dip.

We only ate at the bar but the restaurant looked lovelylovely and the staff was great and we really had a good time. I recommend this joint, especially for happy hour."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the pork rib bones. Their steaks and atmosphere are excellent. I've been in dressed to the nines or on the way home from the lake and am treated and seated the same way. Best I've found in the West Valley."}
{"text":"This independently owned steakhouse was a wonderful experience, I had the mixed grill (filet mignon with scallops and shrimp) while my wife had the chop salad and French onion soup in a crock over a candle... Absolutely fantastic and a lot of attention to detail and presentation. Do not  miss!  PS, first timers get the butter cake dessert for free... Out of this world!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to celebrate our 20th anniversary at Arrowhead Grill. We weren't making a big deal out of our anniversary on the real date of our anniversary because we are renewing our vows during the Rock N Roll Marathon in Vegas.
But not celebrating at all seemed wrong. So we went to Arrowhead Grill thinking that it was classier than some chain restaurant but we would still be comfortable in jeans.
Wow. What a great last minute idea!
We started with a couple of martinis in the bar. We just squeaked in for happy hour prices so that was a bonus.
We then moved to the dinning room. No wait. 
Our waiter, Kevin, was friendly and competent, albeit a little timid. (My.husband and I were both wait staff when we met so \"friendly and competent\" are huge compliments from me.)  Kevin was knowledgable about the menu and answered all our questions. He was attentive without being so attentive that we felt like we should invite him to join us. It was just the right amount of attention.
We shared the artichoke appetizer. It was SO good! Buttery and salty and tender and grilled and perfect!
We also took a team approach to dinner. I ordered the calamari appetizer for my entree and my husband ordered the bone in porterhouse. We've been to Arrowhead Grill in the past and the reason we chose it for our anniversary was the calamari. It did not disappoint. What I wasn't expecting was that the porterhouse would make me forget that I ever wanted calamari. The rub is so tasty! And the beef was cooked to perfection. And SO tender. 
Even with us sharing the steak we had leftovers.
Because it was our anniversary, Arrowhead Grill gave us complimentary dessert and champagne.  THIS was the most impressive part of the evening. Whoever put the celebration plan in place at Arrowhead Grill deserves a raise. And a glass of champagne. And a dessert.
Great things about Arrowhead Grill's celebrations:
They allow you to choose your dessert A+
They bring champagne A+
They place a really cool sparkler candle on the dessert plate so if you're the type of person.who wants the entire restaurant to know you're celebrating something, it's hard to miss A+
Kevin brought us a hand written card with a coupon for our next visit. A+
And best of all...
THEY DO NOT SING! A+++++!
We were very impressed. We plan to visit the bar for Happy Hour frequently and will dine in the dinning room for special occasions.
Bravo, Arrowhead Grill!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. Delicious food. We drove past this restaurant so many times before finally stopping in. It will now be our go-to dinner spot for celebrations, special nights away from the kids or whenever we get the craving for their sinful butter cake!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  We've been coming here for years and both the service and food are always amazing.  We like to alternate between the bar and the dining area.  There are additional menu items in the bar area, such as Pig Wings which we really enjoy.  I highly recommend trying it.  When it's in season, their Grilled Artichoke appetizer is excellent.  When you're in the mood for a steak I highly recommend the bone-in Filet.  It comes out on a 400 degree plate and it's cooked to perfection.  I usually order it rare+ or medium-rare."}
{"text":"If you've never had a bone-in filet, I recommend you give it a try.  Unless you infuse a filet with flavor, most often they don't have a lot of flavor. Unless you get it bone-in. The bone-in filet at Arrowhead Grill is to die for. Cut with your fork tender and full of flavor.  Perfectly seasoned, the executive chef at Arrowhead knows what he's doing. If you want to top it off with more deliciousness, get their green beans. They infuse the beans with bacon, garlic and butter. Absolutely delicious!  Now for the service. Our server was attentive, on the ball and there when we needed.

So... Do I have anything negative to say? Yes I do... Leave the salt and pepper off the table. It's not needed. The chef has seasoned everything perfectly!"}
{"text":"I generally love this place. We love coming here on our date nights, special occasions and I was recently there for a girls night. We always sit on the bar side or the patio.

Ambiance is cozy and sleek, service is excellent with an exception of 1 time... (A female bartender, first I had seen her I think, or maybe I just don't remember her).

There are a couple bartenders who we see often, the bald guy- cool dude and makes great drinks & the Asian? Guy- he's very cool too and service oriented, he makes good drinks too. We like them. 

We never leave with a small bill... So plan to spend if you go. But it's worth it, food, drinks, service. We really enjoy this place. My Husband and many of our friends will continue to keep coming here for years.

Highly recommend.

Ps: extend your nightly/weekend hours AG!"}
{"text":"I went to Arrowhead Grill on Friday night. We called in advance and we're able to get a reservation. We stated we preferred a booth and we were able to get that as well. It was my first time here and WOW. 

The food was simply amazing. If your love salad, try the AG Salad. It's got layer and layers of yumminess. 

The ambiance was low key. Not romantic but definitely somewhere you could bring a date. Most people were dressed casually. Think business casual. Not flip flops and sun dresses. 

The staff was so great. They paid attention to details. Our waiter let us know the specials and even offered us dessert. 

The only less than remarkable thing there was that they ask you to sign up for their email club at the point of paying. Other than that, it was a truly great experience."}
{"text":"Our waitress Stephanie was absolutely amazing! But the manager Silvio was absolutely awful.  One of our orders took 45 minutes to get to us. All Silvio could say was I will talk to the kitchen. Not even an \"I'm sorry.\" He really was a patronizing ass hole."}
{"text":"Not sure where any of the reviews had a less then perfect night. Last night was the 3rd time my wife and I have gone to this place. Every time it has been great. We didn't know about wine down Wednesday until last night (50% off select wines under 100). But that made it even better. She had medium rare rack of lamb, and it was cooked to perfection. I had the prime rib, cooked what they call Rare + (between rare and medium rare), also perfection. With some great side sauces as well. We split a side of lobster mashed potatoes- perfection. Just can't say enough on the place. Food, service, outdoor seating- just perfection. Thank you to our waiter James and manager for a great night. We will be coming back again real soon."}
{"text":"Been in here 3 diffrent times. Depends on the Bartender and server how good service is. 
We have enjoyed the food so far."}
{"text":"Solid, very fancy restaurant that did everything well. Quite a few cuts of beef and seasoning styles to choose from - our party ordered a few different ones and everyone was happy. I got some creamed spinach as well - my go to side at a steakhouse.

The main thing I remember from this evening was the butter cake which came out with a sparkler on it - just waiter after waiter with a sparkler dessert. The cake was, however, delicious enough to warrant the sparkler celebration - perfect dessert with more of a cookie-dough flavor profile.

On the pricey side, but well warranted - they do what they do well, and what they do is expensive. Make sure to grab a colorful candy on the way out, but BE WARNED! The blue might be mint!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place went this summer with my grandkids and husband when we were in town visiting family I'm going back this weekend for my birthday"}
{"text":"Arrowhead grill is beyond impressive! The bar area is the most popular area to eat. They have an extensive wine list and impressive bar menu. After having a horrible steak dinner at the Phoenician I felt cheated and needed to seek out my craving. I recall seeing emails from arrowhead so I decided to give them a try.  I ordered the bacon wrapped filet and baked potato from the bar menu for 23.99 (19.99 or 15.99 for happy hour). The steak was almost 6-8 oz's steak and I substituted the baked potato for asparagus.  The steak came on a sizzling hot plate with no butter added and the asparagus with a side of béarnaise. Hallelujah , this is what I was looking for . The steak has so much jus and was one of the most tasty I've had in a long time. Asparagus was al' dente and so delicious. I will be a regular here, its unbelievable you can get a killer steak without breaking the bank. Best Kept Secret for sure!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in their Ribeye... so much so that I left more than half of it on the table, not wanting to bother to take it home.

I work with high end meat companies all over the United States, so I'll admit I'm exposed to a lot of high end quality steak... but their Ribeye wasn't great, if I'm honest.  

The best I could describe it would be, \"Eh, ok.\"

A Ribeye shouldn't be that hard to cut... and I mean I had to put effort into cutting it.  

The steak tasted like they dipped it in Prime Rib Au Ju after it was done cooking and then fired it on the grill to finish off.  If they hadn't done that, I fear it would have had no taste at all.

Side dishes were \"just ok\" too.  I had the cream corn, which didnt have much flavor and a twice baked potato.   

The Creme Brulee was good.  

Doesn't beat Ruth's or Dominicks.  Prob won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place!! the food is absolutely incredible!! their lamb chops are to die as well as the lobster mashed potatoes to compliment mmmm!! Not to mention the Appetizers are perfect !! GOOD GOOD GOOD :)"}
{"text":"Great selection of wines and the food is amazing. A little pricey...but worth every penny."}
{"text":"We did a night out at the Arrowhead grill for a group outing.  It was a great time and they make a great Russian Mule!  I had the prime rib, it was awesome, with the fries.  Really liked the atmosphere and the food.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had my first experience at Arrowhead Grill with my fiancé, well, after our dinner.

We both enjoy a great steak and all of the fixings that go with it. The steaks were amazing and cooked to perfection. My fiancé had the 10 oz. Delmonico steak and I had the 14 oz. Delmonico steak with shrimp. The steak was cooked perfectly, had excellent flavor and was definitely the right choice. We also added the macaroni and cheese and lobster stuffed baked potato. All of it was mouth watering amazing.

The environment was relaxing, very romantic, and the staff was awesome. This was a special night and celebrating a special occasion. When I called to make a reservation, Shayna (spelling, I apologize if incorrect) asked if we were celebrating something. I told her yes and she asked what it was. I told her that I was proposing to my girlfriend. She was supportive and immediately told me that they had a romantic table that was lit beautifully and was going to be perfect. It was! I was very happy with her service and also helping keep it a secret as we came in. I also asked if she can make a note for our waiter about the proposal and she told me she was going to do that.

Clarence was our waiter. He was attentive, helpful and not pushy at all. His knowledge of the menu, the cuts, the flavors and pairing of wine were right on. Through the dinner, he let us take our time and I never felt rushed. When I proposed, he was receptive to how I was going to do it and asked if there was a particular camera I wanted to use. It is the details that made it even better. He followed me over and was respectful of giving us space. The video was excellent! 

Thank you Shayna! Thank you Clarence! Thank you Arrowhead Grill! Fantastic people, fantastic food makes a fantastic time."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. You can't go wrong with any of the dishes. My husband and I always share the 48oz Porterhouse. The brussell sprouts are SO GOOD and so is the prosciutto wrapped asparagus. The lobster mac-n-cheese is amazing too. Spinach salad is a must as well. Finish it off with a butter cake topped with ice cream. Amazing!"}
