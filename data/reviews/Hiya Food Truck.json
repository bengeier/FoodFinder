{"text":"The veggie dumplings are winners! I enjoyed the bulgogi beef cup also, I especially loved the clear glass noodles and the pickled radish. I can't say that the carolina bulgogi burger is as exciting though, The bulgogi beef patty was entirely too small for the thickness of the bun, so most of the flavor was lost to just dry bread. I think the idea is wonderful, but needs to be tweaked a little.. maybe grill the bun with some butter first and beef up the patty size especially for $9"}
{"text":"I legitimately search for this truck's next location. My go to to dish would be the pork rice bowl.  Oh and to my surprise the gentleman that took my first order was kind enough to actually deliver my food to the brewery patio shortly after I ordered and came back to ask how we enjoyed it!   10/10 would eat veggie dumplings again."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with Hiya. We met up with them at Free Range Brewery one night. Ordered the brewery special ($10). It came with your choice of bowl and 3 dumplings. The dumplings were disappointing. They were cooked to a nice crisp on the outside but veggie filling did not have an appealing texture. The sauce that they used didn't really work for me either. The spicy mayo made it very heavy. A lighter dumpling wrapper and a more savory dipping sauce would grealty improve the dumplings.  We opted for the spicy pork bowl. The idea intrigued me but the actual execution was a let down. Being Korean, I was expecting the awesome depth of flavors that come from good spicy pork. The flavor was barely there. The bowl had an interesting combination of ingredients but I don't know that it really worked. There were also only 3 very small pieces daikon (pickled radish). A little more would have been nice for some more texture. A larger serving container would have also been nice. It was hard to get to the ingredients buried in the bottom without kicking the things on top out on to the table.   Overall, I'd be willing to give them another shot but they'll have to improve a few things before I'll return."}
{"text":"I had the combo today for lunch. It was really good combination of sweet and spicy. Also the texture was good. (I hate soggy dumplings.) Only wish it had more noodles or offered an option with only noodles and no rice. That is just my preference. However, I will definitely go back.  P.S.  The service was great!"}
{"text":"Yes, 5 stars for a food truck!! This was just good perfection. Flavorful meat and rice, fantastic sauce, I don't even know what some things were but I loved it all together. Also, generous size!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we chose to eat here at the pub crawl. The service was great as well as the food!!"}
{"text":"I was delighted there were food trucks near work the other day and even more excited for a Korean food truck.   The menu was a little limited. It looked like it once was on the side of the truck, but that day all of the choices were written on a sandwich board. I had read reviews and wanted the spicy pork bowl but that was not available.  I get the feeling their menu might change often.  So I got the bulgogi quesadillas as a starter and the spicy katsu bowl combo. Yes. I said combo. I love when there are combo deals at food trucks.At this one the combo option gives you two veggie dumplings and a drink or three veggie dumplings.   So I love bulgogi,  but did not enjoy the quesadillas.  I couldn't taste the flavors of bulgogi because the cheese was overpowering.  I could have used more of the barbeque sauce as well. Next time I'd like to try the bulgogi bowl instead.  Now I loved the spicy katsu bowl. The bowls start with rice and rice noodles on the bottom. For the katsu, it's basically a panko breaded fried chicken. And the spicy katsu sauce is poured on top and swaps down to the rice. I had a generous amount of sauce and was thankful for it. It was spicy and sweet and the chicken absorbed it well. If you do the combo, there was lettuce on top of that which I could of done without because it wilts. And then the dumplings are on top. I enjoy the veggie dumplings, but they are a little different. Mine had a more chewy texture since the wrapper or dough is pretty dense. The filling was just okay for me. There's sauce drizzled on top which adds a lot more flavor.   I was full, but found myself craving more of the spicy katsu sauce way later so I would like to catch this truck again sometime."}
{"text":"This truck is amazing food exemplified! Stage 3 sauce was amazing and to be at an event like this only tops it off! Well done Stella and Daniel"}
{"text":"HIYA was parked outside of Birdsong, the day after the Eat a Peach release. There wasn't really a long line but these guys seemed pretty overwhelmed and backed up on making orders. My ten minute wait turned in to 25. Had I know this I probably would have taken a pass, as we had other food stops on the agenda.  The Chicken Katsu sandwich was hot, fresh, juicy but a bit bland and definitely overpriced at $8.  The Spicy Katsu rice bowl was decent - the spicy sauce had nice flavor, but as noted in other reviews didn't have much depth and definitely was not spicy. It was definitely filling, but again hard to justify $9.  Sorry guys! Wish I could rate you higher but between the wait, prices and blandness.... You guys definitely have the potential to up your game though!!"}
{"text":"Really really enjoyed the brewery combo which comes with three veggie dumplings on top of a rice bowl with your type of meat. I got the bulgogi beef. It was so delicious. The food truckies were very polite and nice. It took about 10 minutes to make but was definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"My experience was similar to Christi's below. We popped over to Free Range Brewing to try Joe's Doughs and Hiya was out front. I ordered the Bulgogi bowl. I was picturing rice topped with slices of thin beef in a sweet sauce. Crisp and savory meat with a sweet sauce to mop up with rice. I was thinking way ahead of myself. Instead I got clumpy, over cooked rice with chopped meat topped with lettuce drizzled with spicy mayo and a couple pieces of fluorescent pickled something. There were also cellophane rice noodles on one side...? Not at all what I expected. $9 - price isn't bad but the execution wasn't there."}
{"text":"If it's Korean I'm 99.5 of the time going to try it .   The first review of 2017 starts off well. I was able to sample this food truck at the NYE festivities .  Hiya had a small menu and If I wasn't cold and in a hurry from a screaming 21month old I probably would've sampled more than the bulgogi quesadilla. I like that you could get a side of pickled jalapeños with it and chopsticks to complete your asian foodie experience.    Taste Factor: a 3, it wasn't mind blowing flavor popping with each bite, but it wasn't bad either . The portion size was good for the $4 price , and I loved that it wasn't dry. I think it this is a safe way for those who haven't had Korean to get their taste buds wet . If I see Hiya's food truck again I will order one of the rice bowls and update my review . Until then , nom nom!"}
{"text":"I tried the veggie dumplings, which were good.  They weren't the best I've had, but I would try them again.  The service was friendly, but took forever to make the dumplings only.  Service could've been quicker and dumplings could've been crispier."}
{"text":"Enjoyed at Birdsong on a Friday night!   We ordered the spicy pork bowl combo, which included 3 veggie dumplings for $2 extra dollars #worthit.   We also had the beef quesadilla, which for $5 was yummy and way worth it.   The spicy pork bowl was definitely spicy. Probably too much for most, but was perfect for me. Loved the flavor and spice. Asked for pickled jalapeños on the side and got pickled daikon radish instead and It was perfect on the spicy pork.   Waited a bit longer than expected, but we had a great experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I shared a meal here over the weekend in Rock Hill and it was amazing. The service was quick and friendly and the food was hot and fresh. What really drew us in was how great it smelled and how big the portions were that we saw others with. I will be sure to let others know about this place."}
{"text":"I was craving some Korean food so my BFF and I ventured out to 26 acres brewing where we found the gem known as Hiya Food Truck. I tired the beef bowl and dumplings and it was a-m-a-zing! The portion looks small but it was actually just enough food. Now if you're some big or very hungry guy you might be disappointed but for the average person the combo (bowl & dumplings) was filling. The food service was quick and the staff was very friendly. We actually stayed around for their food challenge (as of now they only have 1 winner) and the server let me try the hot sauce and oh man it was like hell fire.  All and all I would find them again and grab some goodness."}
{"text":"I had the Hiya spicy pork bowl at the Rock Hill Food Truck Friday and I'm sorry to say that I ended up trashing it before finishing.  There was so much sauce that I couldn't taste anything else and it arrived to me lukewarm.  I'm not sure that I would try them again with all the other options."}
{"text":"The food truck came to an event at our church and I can't say enough good things about them. First off the food was amazing, the dumplings were cooked perfectly and the beef bowl was full of flavor. The portions are generous and were enough to split between an adult and a small child. The owner was kind and graciously answered all our questions. I would definitely recommend them and will keep my eyes out for them at future events."}
