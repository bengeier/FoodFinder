{"text":"The food here is great.  I just wish the portions were larger.  I feel like they've shrunk a bit since when I first went there.  It is slightly overpriced but their food is awesome."}
{"text":"This restaurant is famous for it's seafood and justly so.  The Chilean sea bass is excellent, when available, and the honey-chili Calamari appetizer is outstanding.  I have always had excellent service - waiters are friendly, attentive and ready to fix/modify any dish per your specs.
I have always had to sit inside though - never found a table at happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  I live out near University Circle and if it wasn't a 35 minute drive away, I would come here every week.  

The highlights: 
The meats.  They are always cooked perfectly so a medium rare is actually medium rare.  I've gotten the sirloin and the prime rib here and they're always cooked exactly as specified and seasoned well.

The service.  I've requested the same waiter since the first time I ate here because he is extremely attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and an all-around friendly guy.  If you go, ask for Carl.  

Price.  I got a 10 oz prime rib with a wedge salad and garlic mashed potatoes for $20.  Very competitive with some of the other places I've gone to.  

My only minor gripe is that the happy hour is too popular.  I waited 20 minutes for a table to open up and not a single one opened in that time.  It sounds like a great menu though so if you come early/late enough for a table, I would give it a shot."}
{"text":"I went here while in town for work. Nothing special. The place is nice and the atmosphere was casual. The service was so so. My seafood was overcooked. The salmon was jerky-like. The vegetables were the best part. Typical mall restaurant fare. At least I didn't pay for it myself."}
{"text":"Blake's was our pick over Blue Point only because it was closer and we didn't want to eat very late.The dinner started off with a poma martini which was yummy and a calamari appetizer that consisted of all rings and an amazing sauce. The crab bisque was probably the bets I've ever had and not too salty. My wife and I split two entrees... peanut crusted jumbo shrimp and surf and surf consisting of a lobster tail, cocktail shrimp and crab cake. I didn't care for the peanut shrimp as there was too much breading and it was overpowering (she liked it though). The asain salad that came w/ the dish was tasty and different. The shrimp and crab cakes were decent and the lobster was surprisingly fresh. The price for the entire night with 4 drinks was exactly $100. Very reasonable for above average seafood. Not quite Blue Point, but in a pinch will do better than Red Lobster (except for the Red Lobster Cheddar BAy buiscuits which make the trip worth it)

I would return without hesitation."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed! They no longer have prime rib on the menu. Without the prime rib, I can't justify going out there to eat. =("}
{"text":"Good food but great Happy Hour.  If you looking to relax after work, grab a drink or two and enjoy some pretty good food at a great value this is the place.  Nice formal eating area as well but really enjoy happy hour here."}
