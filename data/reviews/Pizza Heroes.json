{"text":"Ordered for pickup after seeing this was a new pizza spot. The restaurant was clean and staff welcomed me. Had it been a little dirtier it would have reminded me of the pizza places I grew up going to in NY and NJ. After talking to the guy working tonight, sounds like he had the same problem I did living here, there is good pizza but there isn't a lot of good New York Pizza. This is one of only a few hidden spots in Vegas that has the type of pizza that NY transplants are looking for. There is a taste that NY pizza had that makes it different and this place has \"it\". Like the 99Â¢ slice shops I would visit this place took me back. 

The sauce was well balanced as far as (limited) sweetness and seasoning. Right amount of cheese on the pie and the crust was the right thinness and cooked where it was crispy enough to support the cheese, but not too well done where it's too crunchy. 

I am a pizza snob. My wife gets on me about it all the time. This place won me over and I think it will win you over too. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Really awesome service! The owners and staff our great. But by far the best pizza I have ever had. Highly recommend Pizza Heroes. Quality ingredients, met the owner Kyle while on a run for fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"Take it from a New York guy, the New Yorker who owns this place knows how to make a pie. Ask any New Yorker what they miss about back home when they live in Vegas food will always be on the top of the list. And of the food Pizza is always the number 1 without question. Most pizza places out here  are passable but it's not the same. Pizza Heroes I gotta say reminds me of home, the crew here deserves some high marks without a doubt. I'd swear they imported New York water the crust is that good. Do yourself a favor get here and you won't be disappointed. I only wish it was closer to me so I didn't have to drive across town lol, but the fact that I do should say everything. Oh and don't miss the cannolis, I'm usually supremely disappointed when I try them at places, Pizza Heroes however are best I've ever had in this town bar none."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza great service and great prices. Have to come back and try all of their menu. They sell pizza bye the slice!!!"}
{"text":"Ugh so disappointed! First they don't have REAL ranch so that killed it. The pizza was just plain no flavor at all. Garlic knots were cold and look like they have been sitting out all day. Seems like more an after school spot for high school kids."}
