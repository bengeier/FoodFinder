{"text":"Since it opened, this place has become a West Toronto local favourite. And what's not to love? HUGE slices with fresh ingredients at reasonable prices. While I defintely have had better pizza before, for something quick, fairly inexpensive and reasonably tasty, there isn't much within walking distance that beats it. Just stay away at noon during the week, or the highschool crowd will eat you alive.   If you can't make it in, they have delivery available too."}
{"text":"okay  walk-in is the only options #dontbefoolish  everybody knows these slices are enormous and delicious. garlic oil is a must on crust!   beautiful and helpful service. goddamn, this place is lit."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, not great.  We went in and order 3 different slices, all very tastey and the crust is great but it didn't pop out at you as being fantastic.  The size of the slice is big but I have had larger in the city.  I think that the crust could have been thinner for the type of pizza they are trying to replicate.  The staff was friendly and the place seemed clean.  Would I go back? Maybe if I was in the area again and was dying for a slice but I would not go out of my way."}
{"text":"I really really like King Slice slices that you can buy and take away. So, in light of this we ordered some for delivery.  It was a disappointment.  The pizza was much less tasty than that in the restaurant and was actually partially inedible as the onions seemed sort of off."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location for years. They have renovated, and are possibly under new management, because this is not the King slice i once knew.  Pros - more seating, more welcoming ambiance. Cons - pizza sucked! Crust was thick and doughy, and toppings were scarce. My slice of Margherita had 2 meagre pieces of basil on it. And they were so tiny it could have been the same leaf cut into 2. They also pared down the menu drastically - only offer 4 types.  The King Slice i once knew served scrumptious thin sliced crispy pizza, with fresh herbs, tomatoes and spices. Sadly this new King slice falls under the \"Pizza Pizza\" category - will do the job if you're hungry and find cardboard appetizing."}
{"text":"The pizza is good but the delivery service is constantly disappointing. More than 20 minutes later than promised from bloor & dundas location the last three times ordering and cold by the time it got to us :(. Hope they will improve wait times soon. We are suspending our loyalty for now."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've found in Toronto. I'll drive 30 min to get it, even though there are a ton of pizza places closer to me. My god the crust alone is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I first went to King Slice in grade school, some 14 years ago. A small pack of us hopped on the Roncesvalles streetcar at lunch and made our way up to Bloor, all on the basis of a classmate's tip that we'd find some outrageously sized slices for only $3.50. To our delight we were served slices almost twice the size of Pizza Pizza's, loaded with cheese and fresh toppings, all over a sweet crushed-tomato sauce.    Inflationary prices aside, King Slice, I'm happy to say, still makes the same delicious pie. Their mushroom and Jalepeno slice, aptly named the Arrabiata, is my favorite.   Although the place is generally flush with fresh slices, its often prudent to wait for the next wave of slices to be cooked, as the girl  behind the counter can sometimes be inclined to get rid of the dried-out ones that have been sitting a while. Don't be timid about calling her on it. There's  no such issue at peak times.  Be sure to ask for the basil and garlic butter to be brushed onto your crust. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Its good. Not the worst or the best. But safe and tasty. I always eat in and get pizza. The serving is huge. However I do prefer another local chain better."}
{"text":"The slices were huge!! The walk-in service was really friendly and quick. The pizza crust wasn't quite what I expected. It's not a thin crust but it's not like a pizza chain either. Definitely glad I stopped by."}
{"text":"Hit or miss, the margarita pizza can be amazing, or really average."}
{"text":"King Slice literally serves the biggest slice of pizza I have EVER had!  I had the \"standard\" pepperoni and cheese and loved every last inch of it!  The price is very affordable given its  massive size.  I also opted for the crust to be brushed with garlic oil which was a much more welcomed flavor than a dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"I've been a loyal patron of King Slice for at least 10 if not 15 years now and it never gets old. The only place where I've had a better pizza was in Italy itself. Every time I'm in the neighborhood I make sure I stop by for a slice.  The one thing I want to point out too is that I've only seen them increase prices once over the 10 or so years and somewhere in the range of 10-25cent.  In terms of off days for slices, I've had that happen occasionally though very infrequently. For the most part the slices are great.  Also try their pasta and soups (tomato soup is amazing)."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed eating here a couple of times. I've only ever had the pizza slices. So far I've tried the deluxe (pepperoni, green pepper), arrabiatta (mushroom, jalapenos) and Hawaiian (ham and pineapple). My faves have been the Hawaiian and deluxe. I was missing the meat in the arrabiatta. Each slice is $4.65 plus tax, the Hawaiian is $4.85. They brush the crust with garlic oil if you like. The slices are really big. 1 slice is enough for most people, but not me.   I noticed that the slice occasionally falls to bits, but it didn't bother me that much. Also, I'd recommend eating in because I noticed the pizza got soggy pretty quickly. It doesn't hold up so well after it's been out a while.   Service was quick. There's a small seating area but no aircon/heating as far as I could see. This place is cheap enough to be the place I go to for pizza, but I definitely will always choose to eat in."}
{"text":"Honestly, i don't think there's any other place in the city where you can get such a large, gourmet slice of 'za for the price!"}
{"text":"The best pizza on the Bloor strip from Dundas West station to Jane subway station. The slices are huge, like a small pizza at Pizza Pizza.  There are four types of prepared slices, with my favourite being the Deluxe, followed by the Arabiatta vegetarian slice that has jalopena peppers all over it.  Very garlically, which is the way I like it.  Not a traditional pizza, but I love it just the same.  The seating area is comfortable, and in the summertime there is a very small patio. On Christmas Day, this is one of the few places open, and it is also licensed."}
{"text":"Positives: delivered when they said they would: 45 minutes.  Negatives: the pizza tasted like the giant cardboard box it came in. $30 will get you a lukewarm slice with congealed white cheese on a stale flap of bread with chopped up tomatoes and a few scattered shrivelled greens. That was supposed to be a margherita. Left us wishing we ordered Dominos. Or Pizza Pizza. Or frankly any other pizza.  Wouldn't mind it if I was buying a slice for $1. Never again. Also don't listen to blogto's top 10 lists."}
{"text":"Need two two paper plates to carry a slice. Pizza is so so. I've only had the deluxe but wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Service was not good at all - slow and unfriendly.  I ordered a slice of the DELUXE but had to wait 7 minutes for it to bake as there was none on the take-out tray.  No problem having to wait ... at first.  But then 4 males came long after me who also had to wait for an ARRABIATTA pizza.  It's odd that their pizza was \"READY\" long before mine and yet it was put into the oven AFTER mine.  Of course I was not amused by this sexist environment.  I guess I must have been the wrong gender??  Needless to say almost $6 for a slice of pizza is not worth the product, as the toppings were used sparingly and it was swimming in a vat of oily grease blobs.  YUCK!  I won't be returning there again."}
{"text":"Best slice in town! Arabiatta is my go to. Make sure you get the  garlic oil on your crust. Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza-by-the-slice in Toronto, and one of (if not THE) largest too!  Even though pizza is ubiquitous, I'll hop on the subway for a slice of arrabiata (mushroom, garlic, and fresh jalapeno) from King Slice.  I'm a big sauce guy when it comes to pizza, and this place can go up against any pizza-by-the-slice sauce I've ever had.  It's not Terroni or Libretto, but it's as good as pizza sauce gets in the $5 range. Fresh. Same with the ingredients on the arrabiata (the only slice I've ever tried), which are well matched.  There are only four choices of slice: cheese, pepperoni, arrabiata, and deluxe, but it really shouldn't matter because the crust and sauce stand up on their own. I suspect that having only four choices is one of their *secrets* to keeping the slices always tasting fresh.  That's the only rational explanation I can come up with.  Maybe they use magic fairy dust in their crust.  I've been in for a slice 2 minutes before closing.  Cringe now; that's never the right time to go for a stale, reheated slice.  Am I right?  Not in this case.  For all I knew, my reheated slice had been baked five minutes earlier.    Go for the garlic oil on the crust.  There's nothing outstanding about it, but it doesn't hurt, and you won't be holding this slice by the crust anyway.  It's too big.  My only reservation about King Slice is that I wonder if the peppers they're using now are less hot than they were a few years ago.  I remember having a lot more difficulty eating them when I first discovered this place.    Take it from a guy who will travel 40+ minutes (by subway) for an excellent slice: King Slice is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizza place .. I always buy the pepperoni slice.. It's amazing :D"}
{"text":"King Slice is a little overrated. The slices are definitely big and that's a plus- but its fucking gross when you want to take it away and all they do is spread it over two paper plates and put it in a paper bag (which can only retain so much grease).   Outside of that, the pizza is good- nothing I've written home about- the best kind I've had so far was garlic/hot pepper/mushroom. Greasy. If you need a quick slice and you're in the area, do yourself a favor and sit in, and splurge four bucks.   ps Make sure you get the garlic oil spread along the crust."}
{"text":"Ive gone here quite a few times for a slice, good prices, good sizes and they have this delicious garlic rub for the pizza crust."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas i've had in Toronto! And cheap! Their humungous slice that you can get on a walk-in is just $5.25, and it tastes delicious. Their Arabiatta slice was amazing, and i heard good reviews about the Margherita as well. Would definitely recommend and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here! Since we first tried 'King Slice' me and bae have been coming here almost every week for our pizza fix. Prices are very reasonable at approx. $5 for a huge slice, we usually go for the pepperoni or the margherita but i would recommend anything on the menu. Make sure you get the garlic oil on your crust and caution stay away from the chili flakes they are seriously spicy  and will probably kill you.. just saying."}
{"text":"Went to king slice for lunch. I ordered the veal parm (7.50), it was hot and had lots of flavour! The service was great! I would go here again  and try other options for sure!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza place in Toronto. Although the slice selection seems limited, it's actually a good enough variety. Not much to say other than the pizza is fantastic and the staff are always friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Hands down. The Best pizza I have had since I moved to the city. Huge slices, fresh and the brushed on garlic sauce is amazing. Plus they are sometimes open late (usually on the nights when you would need it most lol) And it's right across the street fr me : ) Ten's!"}
{"text":"Had the Arrabiatta slice (Jalapeno, Garlic and Mushroom) on January 20.  This was my second visit, and I will vouch for the fact that these slices are BIG.  They make \"The Big Slice\" slices seem small.  Very cheesy and good.  I usually ask for \"easy sauce\" when ordering a pizza, but wasn't put off by this sauce.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place has such good reviews. My pizza was one of the worst I've had in Toronto. It had bland sauce, I think they topped it with raw bacon before baking it, and the tomatoes on it not only were sad and underripe but they included the stem portion that should have been thrown out after chopping. On top of this it cost $25! What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Just tried their meatball sandwich. Yummy!  Service is friendly. Would definitely repeat and perhaps have them cater some sandwiches for casual dinner parties with friends. V.Generous portion. Amazing value."}
{"text":"What's the hype about this place. It is ok/good... The crust is a bit on a thicker side than one would like. Makes the pizza doughy. Though sauce is nice... I lived in Brooklyn, NY for over a decade and I am a bit spoiled yes.... but Pizza Nova beats this place in how close it comes to New York style pizza."}
{"text":"This place was great!  Atmoshpere is very cool, ordering was easy with the employees all being very helpful. The pizza was Delicious! Very filling and reasonable price for the money. Pizza was out within 15 minutes and was, as I said before, completely yummy. It was my first time in Toronto and next time I come I will definetly eat here again."}
{"text":"Stepped out to grab some thai food but ended up coming to King Slice, Amazing service and pizza, totally coming back again. We ordered the speciality pizza Napa."}
{"text":"I cannotttt feel my mouth. Covering the pizza with their home made chili flakes, was probably a bad idea. But it was so good; I may not feel my lips for a while but that was so worth it.   Their slices are HUGE. Think twice the size of your norm' pizza pizza slices.   Drenching your pizza in their garlic oil is a must. I've never been so excited to devour pizza crust.  Nothing beats their panzerottis. Loaded with cheese,   sauce and just about anything, packed with flavour - you can order any of their pizzas in panzo form. Their pastas are pretty bomb too. King Slice has been my go-to since I've discovered them.   This place is legit. Beware, the arrabiata packs a mean punch. Their staff is super chill and friendly, and you will ultimately give birth to a food baby after eating from here.   Gotta deduct one star; I've always alwaysss had terrible experiences with their delivery service.  Otherwise, definitely would pick this (and their Bloor location) over any of their franchised competitors!"}
{"text":"Huge tasty pizza slices! Cross between a Pizza Hut oily crispy pan pizza crust and normal crust. Only 4 flavours and they all taste good... 2 pepperoni and 2 vegetarian. Ask for the garlic oil on your slice. Their chili flakes are super hot, use sparingly."}
{"text":"walk in - place order - wait for order - pizza is ready - *moment of silence*(chompchompchomp - notimefortalking) - sit back into chair - realize i'd just had the *best* slice of pizza in a LONG time. hail to the king!  prices per slice are insanely reasonable @ $4.25, considering each slice is about equivalent to the size of a foot-long sub. I guess we didn't look at pricing initially though, and were a bit taken aback when 3 slices came out to $15+. it all made sense when we saw that one slice requires double the plates to hold. in lieu of a thick, heavy dough we were delighted to sink our teeth into gently crisped crust. I have no idea how they're able to make such massive pizzas with such thin crusts, and no tearing - but obviously they're running the show and i'm not.  lots of people were here for pick up/takeaway orders on a weekday evening, but I was in no rush and dined in. I can see how the piping hot pizza heat might've killed the crispness of the crust for those who travelled with the pizza and were left dissatisfied. as we waited for our slices, my ears kept perking at the sound of \"garlic oil\" being offered. most definitely recommended - brushed onto the crust, it makes you want to carboload that much more.  the simplicity of the margherita showcases that King Slice does not skimp on cheese (although there could always be more basil) and is appropriately saucy. the sprinkling of oregano was tasty too. chompchompchomp.  I demand more Kings to rule Toronto!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but for a quick (BIG MOFO) slice, this beats any of the Pizza Pizza style chains. The staff was laid back, but friendly. They recommend pizza sides at no charge like their own garlic oil and ground chili flakes. My son and I sat quietly at counter facing the patio environment and watch the people head home from work.  If your in the area, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"King Slice is probably my favourite pizza place in Toronto. I stumbled across the place after moving into the area; my mom and I wanted to go for lunch while she was visiting and we stopped in here. We were both a little suspicious of the prices for a single slice of pizza (they were about $5-$6), but we were completely blown away when they brought our order out to us.  The slices were so large that they had to be served on two paper plates. I've never seen pizza so damn big before! The pizza they cut it from is about the size of a dinner table, which you can see if you walk to the back. I had ordered the margherita and it was incredibly delicious. The flavour was really unlike most pizza I'd had before. I also loved that the crust was lightly crispy on the bottom, which gave it a really nice texture. I guess my only \"complaint\" was that a slice so big kind of made it hard to eat in the conventional way.  My mom ordered a small pizza for take-out too. We were both kind of disappointed with it, since it was nothing like the slices we had just had. It had a more thicker, fluffier crust and was more like conventional pizza places. It wasn't bad, but I much prefer the huge individual slices.  The restaurant itself is rather nice, cozy and very clean. It's small, but they have a patio that you can sit out on in the warmer months. It's also nice seeing the open-concept kitchen where you can watch the chefs make the giant pizzas.  Also, I didn't know about their website until today when I decided to post a review. It's pretty bad, but I had to laugh pretty hard at their disclaimer at the bottom: \"King Sice is not responsible for typographical or photographical errors. \" At least it's not a reflection on their food. :3"}
{"text":"This is the classiest late night pizza takeout joint of its type I go to. A really solid player in its category. There will definitely be drunk people there late on a weekend, but the pizza is pretty good year round.  I especially like the Arrabiata, it has a kick to it that I can appreciate. the service is polite, the garlic herb sauce is lovely."}
{"text":"Such good pizza! Slices are huge and under $5! Add the garlic to your pizza. So good! Cute small location. Great for a quick bite"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a slice off and on over the years for the convenience, since it's in my neighbourhood. Sometimes the pizza is great, other times barely warm and tasteless. Recently, for the first time, I ordered a medium spinachi for delivery. Not only was the pizza cold, the spinach was full of sand--every bite was gritty until I couldn't finish one slice. A waste of $25. That was my last visit to King Slice."}
{"text":"There slices are larger then normal therefore  you can share or bring some home. The pizza is tasty and worth the wait unless you are in a hurry. It is cozy."}
{"text":"Delivery is way too slow. We ordered at 7pm, with the person stating that it would be an hour. It ended up being two hours, and when it arrived it was cold - hire more staff or be honest about the delivery time.  Okay, just realised they were on Blog TO today, so I guess that explains the very long wait."}
{"text":"I ordered here for my first time and had a large pizza. They were able to do half Abbabiatta and half Margherita. Legit amazing. I wanted a greasy delicious pizza, not one of these over-priced wood oven pizza's that seem to be the norm on queen west, but not from a chain like pizza pizza. This place was exactly what I wanted and was so delicious. They delivered and said it would take 45-60 mins on a Friday, and it ended up coming in 25 mins!   The second time I ordered, I called for delivery and they just asked for my phone number and they had my address and everything in the system, it took 1 minute to place the order which I thought was impeccable customer service. Couldn't resist getting the Abbabiatta again, and asked for extra jalapeno's which they didn't charge me for. The other half was Napa, and my meat eating friends said it was to die-for, had a bite and the pesto base was heavenly.   Tip: I can say it tastes even better cold for breakfast in the morning!"}
{"text":"King slice is classic. It's delicious and fresh and not to mention huge portions. You get your money's worth no doubt. It can get busy so it can be a bit of a wait at night but it is worth it if you have time. I recommend the pepperoni but they also have other options for vegitarians if needed."}
{"text":"Smashed an entire pizza at 3am.  They weren't exactly the fastest place on earth, but when our food arrived, the driver was cool and very nice.  The pizza hit the spot and we had more than enough to eat the next day."}
{"text":"I dont give a lot of 5 stars but that place is just so good. Big and generous size of pizza. I always eat more then I should. I always call for delivery and the pizza come HOT and the smell of it is just ....omg so great. I thinknits a little bit more expensive compare to some other pizza place but you wont regret it. Its so good!"}
{"text":"3.5. I came here because it was recommended to me over the Pizza Pizza next door. Obviously... all pizza is better than Pizza Pizza. And King Slice was better, but not by much. I think it's hard to make a bad pizza, but equally hard to have a really good slice. King Slice was decent but nothing special for me. The slices were indeed huge. I got the Margherita, which I had to wait a bit for because it was in the oven. They put a nice basil sauce on the crust after it came out of the oven (asked me if I wanted this). They don't have individual slices out there (or at least they didn't when I went), so you get whatever has just been made or is coming up. They have a cute sit down area, as well as other stuff on their menu, which I didn't look through. If you are in the area, I would recommend it over the Pizza Pizza next door, and maybe you'll even enjoy it more than I did."}
{"text":"Great place. I have only ordered food for delivery, but the pizza is very well-done - tasty, fast delivery, excellent price and great variety. Totally recommended."}
{"text":"It was past midnight, it was a cheat day, and I wanted satisfying food immediately, so my friend recommended King Slice. He claimed that it was one of the best pizza places that he'd been to, so I had no choice.  When you order a slice you get a pretty sizeable piece of pie, big enough to warrant a two paper plate platter. (Sorry environment.) I ordered the Arrabiatta: tomato sauce based, mozzarella cheese, fresh mushrooms, jalapeno peppers, garlic & parsley. It was a definitely satisfying and I'd say better than your standard fast food pizza. My criteria here is if after I eat your slice, do I eventually feel ill, (*cough* Gino's Pizza *cough*). To be fair though, it was better than just not-throw-up-worthy. It was pretty good. I'm just not a pizza fanatic, unless if we're talking deep dish. Oh, and definitely get the garlic rub for your crust; a great touch.  If you like pizza, this is a nice choice."}
{"text":"This is a great little pizza place close to my boyfriend's place! We've come here a couple of times before and the pizza is HUGE. It requires 2 plates to hold it! Delicious!. They also offer to brush the crust of your pizza slice with garlic oil. YES please! :)"}
{"text":"4 stars if I was drunk, for a great location that's open late.  Unfortunately I came in here sober on a Friday night, which was a mistake since it was jam packed with drunk people just being drunk and loud and drunk. I mean I was expecting to experience this, but I wanted to give these guys a try over the Pizza Pizza just a short walk over. But even with it being crowded my arrabbiata slice was quick to get to me and very nicely heated up. Special shout out to the staff who still kept their cool in this loud madhouse!  I would have appreciated a little bit more condiment options, but maybe since it was past 2am they had run out of stuff? All they had was a basil spread, which not only was a first for me, but also very good.   I was expecting my slice to be better than it was, and it ended up being pretty standard tasting despite the fancy-ish get up of this location. It's not a bad thing, but I was expecting better, I would still come back here on a more sane hour and possibly give them a try out for lunch, reading some of the other reviews, it looks like they might be better with the sun out."}
{"text":"Several forces conspired to allow me to have the very worst restaurant pizza experience ever, hands down.  Having just moved here from the states, my iPhone no longer works, and thus no ability to look for a decent restaurant.  Next, we took the subway the wrong direction and ended up at Dundas St. West instead of East. Fug.  Yes, I'm a moron.  Anyway, we decided to see what food choices were available above ground at the Bloor/Dundas St W. Stop and began walking West on Bloor.  Have you ever eaten a frozen grocery store pizza? Well it's on a scale worse than that.  I really don't understand the good reviews of this place other than the sheer SIZE of this slice.  It's about 2.5X larger than a standard pizza slice, which is great until you realize you could have stayed home and found some old cardboard to eat out of the recycling bin for free.  I've never even had a pizza THIS horrific.  The crust was almost completely disconnected from the rest of the ingredients.  Everything easily slid off the crust, but not in a good way.    Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"King Slice used to be my go-to for Pizza delivery. I loved the Arrabiata. I still love the toppings. But the last three pizzas I've had are soggy soggy. the pizza falling to pieces in my hands. I dont know if King Slice will clean up their act. But I'm not ordering from there again to find out"}
{"text":"Brutal. Waited for an hour for our delivery, the pizzas got here, and no cheese!! Seriously??!! Of all the things to forget to put on a pizza, the cheese??!!! It was also cold. They are sending over another and 'will take the old one back'. We'll see if we're waiting for another hour. Never again."}
{"text":"This is hands down, the best panzerotti I've had in Toronto. So so good, huge, the toppings are all great quality and the tomato sauce is so fresh! 10/10 this is my new panzo place!"}
{"text":"Dee-frickin-licious. I go here all the time for slices my favourite is the Margarita but when I want something with a bit more spice the arrabiata is really good too. the staff is really pleasant and the service is fast....the key to the deliciousness is to make sure you get that garlic oil on the crust."}
{"text":"Great though massive calzones. I wish they had better drink selection at the queen st location (my complaint about most pizza places to be fair) pasta is pretty comforting and scrumptious. Love the jambalaya, nicely spicy. Always impressed with the cleanliness of all the locations and the friendliness of the staff. Some pizza places are pretty mediocre when it comes to keeping things top notch."}
{"text":"I've never ordered delivery from King Slice, always walked in... I find their pizzas to be a real treat especially when fresh out of the oven... No overcooked cheese bubbles, good amount of toppings. Slices are generous and the garlic oil makes me finish my crust...  Great value for a solid piece of pie!"}
{"text":"2 hours for frozen pizza!! They over charged my creditcard. I called the manager she didn't care, told me to dispute with my credicard.  What a scam!!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizza place in Toronto. I always get the slices so I can't comment about the other dishes. My favourite is the Arrabiatta (sp?) which is a loaded veggie slice and is DELICIOUS. Their slices are always super fresh and they are absolutely gigantic. One slice is a large meal. There is no way I could eat 2 slices! I also think the price is excellent, the slices come in under $5. It's not easy to find a huge, hot, fresh meal with quality ingredients under $5 these days!   I'm kinda surprised by the bad reviews here, this place is amazing. Staff is always super friendly, quick, and accommodating. Once I showed up after they had locked up and the dude counting the till saw me looking sad outside, and he re-opened the store just for me!   I like their crust too, not too heavy, not too thin. I love how they offer to brush garlic oil onto the pizza crust, it's like free garlic bread.   It's also open late, and it has a patio. And a liquor license! I love King Slice."}
{"text":"The ambiance and cleanliness is OK, and the pizza was quite good, except that the crust was too big for the thin crust pizza.  My one pet peeve was/is a big one:  As someone who does not eat pork, I do not appreciate when service staff blithely cut my veg pizza with the same cutter as a pepperoni pizza.  I chose not to make a scene as I was very hungry at the time.   I know I am not alone in this.  I will request a new cutter in the future automatically."}
{"text":"Huge slice of better than average pizza. Had the Arrabiata slice. It could have used more jalapeño peppers. But I can't complain. Staff was pleasant. Service was fast. Slice was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This would be really great pizza, if my idea of a great pizza consisted of a ludicrously large portion of the kind of pizza one would find at a high school cafeteria. Alas, that isn't my idea of a good pizza, and so King Slice does not rate highly on my list.   The deluxe slice I ordered was really bland. The cheese didn't taste very fresh and was barely melted (I prefer the cheese on my pizza to have the kind of golden color that comes from a little extra time in the oven). I liked the crispy crust, but the toppings weren't integrated with/anchored to the crust -- it was sort of like eating a pizza made on one of those Boboli pizza shells from the supermarket, where the toppings just slide right off. The slice was gigantic, but it just wasn't very good. Because the slice is so large, it's served on two plates; however, their use of flimsy paper plates just makes things super messy.   On the other hand, the Greek salad was impressive for a pizza joint: the lettuce was fresh, crisp, and hand-torn; the tomatoes were ripe; the feta was semi-soft and nicely briney.   Sorry, King Slice - this princess is off to find pizza in another kingdom."}
{"text":"I've now had take-away and eat-in from King Slice (full pizzas made to order), but have yet to try their ready-to-go slices -- I suspect that is why I'm saying \"4 star\" rather than 3 or less.  Ours was pretty damn excellent, while ready-to-go almost always suffers and is a poor method of judging quality.  The take-away in particular was impressive, as the good folks at King Slice made us a custom, off-menu bruschetta-style pizza for our lactose intolerant co-worker that was freakin' delicious!  They diced the ingredients right then and there, and there was no extra charge for asking and receiving the extra mile.  Our eat-in experience was a learning one, as the 'za was tasty but with toppings that were a bit too chunky for our tastes.  That's the thing with King Slice, though:  they do everything BIG.  So our arrabiata pizza had rather huge -- and extremely fresh -- chunks of jalapeno.  Fine for me, as I like it hot, not so fine for my dining companions who -- although they can handle some heat -- were picking off more than half the generous offering of peppers.  No worries, though, it was still tasty and had both ladies declaring my recommendation a good one, and that we'd now found our go-to neighbourhood delivery joint.  Other notes:  This is thick crust -- I doubt they do it thin at King Slice.  You can get whole wheat, but only on the large pizzas as it's pre-made and in limited quantity.  The regular crust is good but could use a biiiiit more salt.  Sauce is thin but savoury, and I didn't feel like I was in want of more (which is rare for me -- I like a saucy 'za).  Cheese is very, very stringy -- a good tasting mozzarella, and they looked like they were going through bucket fulls of the stuff (our XL pizza alone probably sported a pound or more of cheese!).  Subs/custom orders are welcome:  As said, we had an off-menu bruschetta, and our arrabiata subbed in eggplant for mushroom (due to a mild allergy).  Only real complaint is that for all the great food, they're lacking in the drinks department -- macrobrew beers, bottled pop and water, etc... very, very boring.  It would be nice if they matched their excellent cooking with some excellent suds!  Still, it's a quibble, and their FREE DELIVERY policy means we can always order in and enjoy our own stock of fine craft beers!"}
{"text":"I was there a few weeks ago and got the Margherita and thought it was just OK, the slices are huge, but the crust is too doughy and thick and there is really no attempt at a sauce. There is a lot of blubbery cheese. So I went again today on Easter Sunday and tried to get one of their sandwiches and she told me \"we've been out of sandwiches for two days\"! How does a business that is serving customers not have ingredients on hand for two days? So I got the Margherita again and now my opinion is solidified; they aren't any good. It wasn't hot enough, wasn't melted, the crust was doughy, no proper sauce, there was too much garlic. They really don't have much in the way of selections either, one cheese, one pepperoni and two with hot chillies  or hot sauce. You'd be better to make yourself a melted cheese sandwich at home using some nice bread from Cob's bakery and some good cheese and olives..."}
{"text":"Stopped here after an evening with many many many drinks involved ('tis the season!)  Ordered a deluxe slice and it was massive! Love love love the basil (?) garlic oil they will slather on the pizza if you ask. Prices are super reasonable. It was under $10 for two slices (one for me and the bae).  Pizza tasted very fresh and delicious, I will definitely return! I believe it may have even saved me a bit of hangover for the next day ;)   Great option for a quick, cheap bite!"}
{"text":"The king special was the most basic pizza I've ever ordered. $22 for a medium. Better than pizza pizza but still not impressed."}
{"text":"Their slices are a monstrosity, and they will seem even smaller when you've had a few whiskeys in your system.   While your mind may be telling you \"no,\" your body will be telling you \"Because Canada!\"  Don't fool yourself, take your sweet time with this one. Pacing is the name of the game."}
{"text":"I prefer that my pizza place not try to kill me.   This was our regular pizza joint for about a year. It was consistent. We generally ordered the same few things.   On our last and final order, we got a pizza  with ricotta cheese as one of the toppings.   After a few bites of not being able to identify a different flavour, we realized it was sour and rancid cheese.   Called back and asked if they'd check the expiration date on the ricotta. \"Sorry\", he said, \"we've already thrown out the container.\" Told him I'd hold while he fetched it from the trash.   He said he was sorry and that he just didn't have it.   This phone call was 5 minutes after it was delivered. You do the math."}
{"text":"Was craving spicy pepperoni pizza all day and after a few drinks at the Dog & Bear Pub I just had to satisfy my taste buds.   Thankfully I was passing by this place and had to get a slice.  It was perfect late night drunk food! It was cheesy, greasy, spicy, meaty, and the slices were huge! They had to serve it to me in two plates LOL seriously -_- why can't you guys just invest in bigger plates instead of making your customers balance food on two plates and risking the chance of it falling.  Anyways, great pizza! Costed me $5.25 for a pepperoni slice, and I would probably go here again if I happen to pass by :D"}
{"text":"I have lived near King Slice my whole life, which means it has always been part of my life. Granted I haven't always gone super often, but now I'm going to make it a point to do so.  IGNORE BAD REVIEWS ABOUT THIS PLACE!!!  King Slice has its name for a reason. Their pizza slices are bigger than what you would get at any other pizza place. The pepperoni is the best! I usually get dipping sauce for my pizza here. It just enhances the experience.  King Slice uses fresh ingredients. They buy their tomatoes and other ingredients at the fruit markets down the street.  Many years ago they increased their prices but it is so worth it. If you don't eat here, you are missing out.  King Slice is a place to chat with friends as you devour your pizza - maybe you can even have an eating contest and see if anyone can eat two or more whole slices!"}
{"text":"I love their pizzas, one of the best I've ever had actually. I always rave about it and tell people they need to try it! - My favourite is the Margherita pizza and say yes to garlic sauce!! You're welcome."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. But i minus one star because of the chili powder.  Yes one star is alot but i must warn the chili powder is the equivalent of dog mase. I opened the container and i couldnt stop sneezing for 20 min. I mean if you can handle the heat why not - its home made vietnamese chili powder,  but i find if you put a pinch of it , it could over power the flavor of the slice. Still good pizza."}
{"text":"So to start i'm not sure this is actually pizza. It looks like pizza but tastes exactly like pizza bread. I'm not saying it wasn't good. The slice was fresh, really big and lots of toppings but didn't tastes like pizza at all. Also it was mostly bread, probably 3/4 of the slice.   If your in the neighbor hood and want something filling and cheap go for it. I just can't compare this to other pizza slices."}
{"text":"If you like caker-style Italian food overly drenched in garlic, onion, and basil then you'll like this. The pizza is a better option than the pasta or sandwich options."}
{"text":"Ok, ok, ok.  I know.  I know.  Yes, I've been a smarmy dick when it comes to reviewing pizza in Toronto.  But, you know, too bad:  I'm a New Yorker, and when it comes to being-a-smarmy-dick-when-it-comes-to-pizza, I'd be in serious danger of losing my Ol' Neighborhood cred (and notice the absence of a \"U\" there, huh?) if I weren't so smarmy in the Neapolitan department.  Capiche?  But.  King Slice is... yeah, fine, ok... pretty... (ok, I'll say it) awesome.  Granted, the crust is still a little thick (at about 1/2\") for me, and granted, they could still use a little more sauce... but, my friends, apart from that, this kid from Brooklyn is actually kinda impressed.  I'll even give them a Fuckin' A.    On a steady basis, King offers several slice varieties:  Deluxe, Arrabiatta, Margherita, Pepperoni, Hawaiian, Greek, Italian, and Caesar.  All the toppings are fresh, succulent, and abundant, but the real thing is the size.  Seriously.  If my ex-girlfriend, the size queen, ate here, she'd be very, very happy.  These slices are the size of a small infant, paisan: at least a solid foot from crust to tip.    And those aren't the only varieties of pizza they offer.  Add to that pollo basilico, Canadian, Giardinetto, Napa, Al Fono, Silician, pancetta, and spinachi.    And other dishes?  Si!  Excellent calzones (Jesus!  They even know what a calzone is supposed to be!), manicotti, lasagna, gnocchi, fusillui, and various options for penne, fettuccini, and spaghetti.  They serve at least six varieties of beer and two options for wine.  The counter generously provides a multitude of self-serve additional spices as well as a never-empty massive glass pitcher of lemoned water.    No, to me, it's still not quite the same as a gooey, saucy, you-need-two-hands-to-hold-it slice of Brooklyn.  But, um...  wow.  He is nevertheless impressed."}
{"text":"2 stars because the pizza came on time.  I called in, the girl on the phone was friendly. She put through our order and voila! Pizza is on time!   As I opened the pizza box, I was excited to see what yelp was yelping about. ?  Perhaps the pizza tastes better only when you're dining in? I'm not sure. All I know is my delivery arrived within the hour as promised and my pizza was BARELY LUKE WARM.   *** this review is for delivery only."}
{"text":"Tried this place and will never try it again. Before Pizzaiolo came to the neighbourhood, Queen West only had Pizza Pizza to rely on but once King Slice came in we had another option to try out. Considering the size of the pizza how could you not want to go in and try it. I got the pepperoni pizza and I must say I have tried better boxed pizza than this place Although portion size is great, the pizza was below average. It was way too saucy, the cheese was chunky as if the pizza had been sitting there for awhile and no amount of chili flakes could save this pizza and eating it can be disasterous. Because I could barely get through half a slice I decided to ask for a box to take it home..you can't really find a big enough pizza bag for it however, when the cashier went to go grab one she got yelled at by the gentlemen in the back and came back to tell me I had to pay $1 for the box ( which was fine by me). I felt bad for the girl but if you want to sell Pizza Slices that big than make a container to go for all the leftovers people leave.   I'd rather visit Pizza Pizza or Pizzaiolo down the street then come back to this place. Womp."}
{"text":"I'll come to King Slice on occassion for a delicious and massive slice of pizza. My choice? Arrabiatta for it's spiced, garlic-y sauce, and I'm not even into garlic.   The slices are enormous, so if you're thinking of getting two slices as one would at the usual suspects, don't.   Decent service. Worth a visit if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at King Slice."}
{"text":"Pretty sure the person I ordered from was high. Despite me having to tell her my address multiple times (and I just live down the street), my order still didn't arrive after two hours. When I called her back her only excuse was that she didn't write down my address or phone number. No compensation was given. Don't order from here, there's plenty of pizza places that can fulfill a simple order for a single pizza."}
{"text":"This is a very generous 2 stars.   The girl on the phone was unfriendly. She also didn't know what gorgonzola is, even though it's a listed topping:   Me \"...aaand blue cheese--  Her \"We don't have any.\"  Me \"Oh,  gorgonzola?\"  Her \"Uh. Yah.\"  Me \"Um, so you do have gorgonzola?\"  Her - no reponse Me \"Sorry, do you have gorgonzola?\" Her \"Ya.\"  Me \"Can I have some on my pizza?\"  Her \"Ya.\"  They got my order wrong.  I ordered 1/2 pepperoni and mushroom, 1/2 mushroom sausage spinach and gorgonzola.  I got 1/2 sausage, 1/2 pepperoni, sausage, spinach and mushrooms. This was a huge blow, especially considering I paid for a 5 topping pizza (\"We don't do half and half since our toppings are all one price instead of meat being more.\")   I had waited the standard 45 minutes for my delivery (free with purchase over $15), so I was hungry and dove in rather than call them back to fix it. The pizza was not great.   The italian sausage was kind of gross... hard, chewy, not-so-tasty discs. You can't always get the nice crumbly out-of-of-the-casing kind, but even still.   The pepperoni was more like salami... would have been good had I wanted salami.  There was SO much cheese, and somehow not in a good way. It seemed like that rubbery, kraft pre-shredded stuff. It was undercooked. In fact when I re-heated it the next day it was much better.    The price is right. The pizza is not.   I'll give this place one more chance to not screw up my order and cook it properly."}
{"text":"Huge pizza slices, and amazing calzones but my favorite is the cheesy meatball sandwich! Nothing is perfect but this is close."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The service is quick and friendly! The slice are ginormous. Glad they opened this second location"}
{"text":"A bit east there are definitely BETTER pizza places; Il Paesano, Calabrese...  for High Park this is very good.  Boring stretch of Bloor St, not much going on.  Slices are very large, I like that, could easily 'share' a slice with someone.  Good fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the salads and I don't care for the calzones, but the slices, the point of the place, are fantastic. The crust is fresh, crispy, chewy, and just great. The arrabiata is my favorite."}
{"text":"The name does not let down... We stopped in for a quick slice and were surprised to see how huge these slices were. Got a pepperoni and they cut it in half and give you the option to brush the crust in garlic oil (YES!). Delicious cheese, pepperoni and ideally thin. The crust was a bit too crunchy, but the oil took the edge off. Would definitely come back for a late night slice if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I tried it for the first time and to be honest, was not a fan of the crust. It was very condensed and reminded me of some cheap pizzas I've had in the past. However, I tried it again since it was around the corner from me and I heard so many good things.  I have to say, I do like my pizzas oily and cheesey and in comparison to Pizzaiolo (which can run on the dry side if you don't add oil on top that is), it really hits the spot like no other.  Big slices are awesome, albeit a little embarrassing as a petite woman to eat alone inside (I usually took it home).   Garlic oil is a beautiful unique touch and the chill flakes are not to be messed around with!  Staff is so so so don't go there for the interaction, just for some tasty grizzly bites.  I recommend you try it, lovely local business :)"}
{"text":"Used to be my go to place.  Slices were really good and big.  I need to give it 3 stars because last few times the pizza wasn't as tasty.  They might have changed something."}
{"text":"I hate giving less than 5 stars, because before last week this was my go-to pizza place in west Toronto. I usually go in for slices, and the slices are huge and a great value - a lot of awesome, fresh pizza for a few bucks, and I highly recommend that still. I love them also for the garlic/pesto oil on the crust - so good!  However I have major reservations about delivery. I had family from out of town last week and I mentioned King Slice, so we got it for dinner based on my high praise. I ordered two pizzas, both with the garlic oil on the crust, and when they arrived, the crusts were burnt black. It looks like they applied the oil to the crust BEFORE cooking, as opposed to after like they do with the slices. So not only did this burn the crust, but the oil was dried up with no flavour to mask the burnt taste. I was so disappointed and to be frank, embarrassed that my high praise was backing this.  The pizza was fine, but beyond pepperoni I'm not sure I recommend anything else. The unripe green peppers were sliced super thin and flavourless - I like thinly sliced peppers, but these had orange bits and were so small that the flavour had evaporated, much like the oil. And the ground beef topping is more of a crumble than actual beef, so again with not much flavour.  Stick with the slices, but I'm super disappointed in their full pizzas."}
{"text":"On this strip of queen west, there's three pizza joints. It took me awhile to stop by this spot but I was just a little bit hungry on my way to an appointment.  After years of walking by (and I kinda did this time too but I felt  guilty. weird, I know) I finally went in.  It's a clean, modern space. This is what they get that shiny star for.   Now, a great measure of a slice is how good that margherita pizza is.  Well, hmmm if you've had excellent pizza this may disappoint you - unless you've been drinking. It's packed here at night with all the bars brim full of hipsters being all hipstery-sloshed on one indie organic brew after another.  I don't add any extras to a slice because it masks how a pizza actually tastes. So here goes: the crust was terribly doughy, the poor shrivelled herbs had no flavour and my goodness, my eyes bugged out from the excessive garlic. Garlic can work as long as everything else in balance but not this time round. It  also seemed have this rather odd salty over tone.  Perhaps their other slices are fantastic but for now, I'm not quite ready to invest another   Let me put it this way, even a bad slice of pizza in nyc is better than this one."}
{"text":"I'm surprised the reviews for this place are so polarized--either awesome or terrible. Looks like a lot of the negative reviews are for their delivery service, which I can't comment on as I've only ever been there in person, but I've been here many times and have always been pleased. They have two vegetarian options, which is nice, and both are delicious! The slices are MASSIVE, so \"one slice\" is two meals for me or a great size to share with someone, at least in my case. They also serve salads and pasta but I haven't tried either of those."}
{"text":"The slice was the size of my girlfriends torso. The price value is good for the size and taste taste for sure."}
{"text":"Tried the king slice special medium size. The toppings were generous, as well as the cheese and sauce. It was a pretty good pizza albeit a little soggy at the bottom maybe due to delivery. We enjoyed it and will probably order again soon. But it's a little pricey compared to dominoes but the ingredients like the cheese and sauce tasted higher quality.  I would eat this any day over pizza pizza but vs. Dominoes it's a toss up due to price."}
{"text":"I've never eaten inside this place and admittedly it would be difficult.  This place thrives on delivery and pick-up business but also have a small number of tables on a small patio that allow you to eat in if you wish.  Forget what you know about Italian pizza this isn't it.  It's a different slice altogether.  Firstly, King Slice is a family-run business and that family is not Italian.  It is Asian.  Before you run away with your purist collection of prejudices, the pizza that they serve, as they proudly term on their website, \"cannot be compared to any other restaurant\".  And it can't.  The crust and the sauce combination is something that lighter, almost fluffier than any other pizza you're going to find.  It's hard to describe and needs to be eaten to be believed.  If it were truly an Italian-style crust, it would be recognizable elsewhere.  It is not.  But nonetheless, delicious.  Having moved out of the area, between this place and Vesuvio (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/vesuvio-pizzeria-and-spaghetti-house-toronto), I'm always torn between the two places as to which pie to order.  Sometimes we get both."}
{"text":"Used love this place and it was my usual go-to for pizza every time. In the past I would have given it 5 stars but the service has taken a serious nose dive and the delivery is always a problem now and for some unknown reason the driver either takes forever, gets lost or calls looking for directions from the wrong place. It's happened enough that it's turned us off the place permanently.  When you call it says \"The menu has changed\" but lately what we have ordered is not what we've got.   The latest pizza showed up with so many onions it was almost inedible."}
{"text":"So I was spending the evening at a friend's house and we decided to order a pizza from King Slice, even though this particular location is literally a five minute walk from said friend's place.  We ordered a party sized King Slice Special and then waited. And waited. And waited some more. Once the one-hour mark rolled around, we figured we should probably call to find out what's going on. We were told that the delivery person had gone to deliver to a residence much farther away than our location, which literally made no sense since, as mentioned, this house was *less than a kilometer away*.  The pizza finally arrived a whole one hour and twenty minutes after we'd ordered it. (Yes, that's 80 minutes.) We paid for the food and decided to call again to express our displeasure, but were told that we would have to wait on the line while a manager was retrieved. No, thanks.  It goes without saying that the pizza was about as far away from hot as one could possibly imagine. It was still pretty good, though, which is why King Slice gets two stars instead of one.  A final note: The person at whose house this occurred was extremely disappointed because he orders King Slice at least once or twice a month, but after this debacle, he said he'll never order from them again. Honestly, I can't blame him."}
{"text":"A co-worker raved to me about this place 10+ years ago and I never got around to trying it. Until recently. Holy delicious, batman!  It's basically a thin and crispy gourmet pizza. The shop is tiny, and is mostly for a skeptical but you could also eat in.   I love the garlic oil they put on the crust too, and the toppings and cheese just melt (literally) in your mouth. The slices are big too (they cut them in half for you) and for around $5, that's a decent deal. I usually just get whatever slices are available. Haven't ordered delivery so can't speak to that."}
{"text":"This place feels like it should be between your chains like pizza pizza and dominos and restaurant pizzas at non-specialized restaurants (i.e. not restaurants that only do pizza). The setting is very much fast food, with the exception of the nice open front that they can open during warmer months. The pizzas always taste fresh, and hot and the slices are large.   The staff are friendly, but not overly special. Service is fast, and I think they have to deal with a lot of drunken people, so kudos to you for keeping a level head while drunk people yell orders at you.   If you're looking for a quick place to eat, this place is fairly priced, fast and fresh!"}
{"text":"Nope.  90 minute wait. 3 phone calls and a soggy pizza that doesn't taste so good. Asked for the manager. Got the managers...mother. Who doesn't speak english so great.  Usually order from FBI but thought we'd try something new. The pasta is kind of gross. The pizza is super bready, and the portion size is pretty disappointing.  We heard you were good. We heard wrong."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place usually love their pizza. But tonight was a little ridiculous. Called ahead and asked about a deluxe slice, girl said sure will have some in a bit. I said okay I'll be there in 10. Got there in 5 minutes and somehow all the slices are sold and they aren't making any more pizzas for the night (Friday night 11:30) Tried to sell me hour old pizza out of the back of the oven. Not down"}
{"text":"Crispy crust, delicious ingredients and slices so big they need to straddle them over 2 paper plates.  I've eaten all of the standard slices here and they have all been wonderful.    Sadly they are often quite busy and I've been unable to quell my hunger long enough to wait for a calazone.  Not only do I go to this place whenever I'm in the area, I've even made special trips for their pizza when I'm not.  It's the first place that comes to mind when I think of pizza!  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while walking along Bloor. It caught my attention when I saw how busy it was. All the seats were taken and there was a constant line up. Looking at the menu I soon realised that they only have a few items on it. Without any doubt, the big seller here are their pizza slices. I decided to try the pizza so me and my friend ordered the Deluxe and Arrabiatta to share. Slices are very big and always served fresh. They will also ask you if you want garlic oil brushed on the pizza crust. I can definitely recommend this - it's delicious! One slice is just under $5 and for the size you get it's a very good deal! Overall a good experience and I will definitely stop by again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I used to live in the High Park area and would have a slice of pizza at King Slice pretty well every Sunday for lunch.  If you got there as the pizza was coming out of the oven, it was amazing.  I moved in 2001 and still stopped in every six months or so.  I noticed over the last couple of years that the quality has been going down hill.  I stopped in for lunch today.  The price has really gone up, the quality has really gone done and the slice is way smaller (not big like the other reviewers have talked about).  The staff has always been cranky but today she was extremely disinterested.    I keep saying I won't ever be back and I REALLY mean it this time."}
{"text":"When I lived in High Park, I would go to King Slice quite often ... I've stopped in every once in a while since I moved from that area.  The staff was rude but the pizza was good if you got it fresh out of the oven.  Two weeks ago King Slice opened a new location in our 'hood at the former Vinny Massimo's and Gord and I stopped in this evening for a slice.  The staff was friendly at this location ... yay!  They have done a lot of renovations since it was Vinny Massimo's (which was kind of scummy).  Gord got a deluxe slice and I got a pepperoni slice.  The slices were large and okay ... I'd go back.  Interesting, though, that they taste different from the other location ... you'd think they would be consistent."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot when we crave a quickie pizza on the go that tastes absolutely delicious.  We have ordered takeout and dined-in. I agree when it is takeout you lose a few precious minutes of hot hot freshness, but that pizza is still good nevertheless. When we dine-in - we are lucky to find good slices out. So we wait (we think it is worth it).  Basically one slice is huge. You can easily split that with someone else if you want  a quick bite. If you're hungry then get your own slice. Two slices, and you're pushing it. Also, the last time I was there I got some bottled beer - which went a-ok with my slice. Great thinking, King Slice.  I would like to point out that whenever we tried sitting in to eat, the tables are usually pretty dirty/oily, so maybe trying to sweep in on a quick spray and swipe wouldn't hurt the business."}
{"text":"Well I work close by and the first place one of my coworkers took me was here, all in all a cozy fresh made pizza experience. I love the sandwiches, Arrabiata/ Margherita slices and found the staff to be friendly. For those complaining about take away of a slice, get 2 and you can ask for a small box for it.  After a few visits, I noticed that post lunch rush, many of the vegetarian pizzas are cooked on one half and the other half are meat. Twice over the course of 3 weeks, I have had pieces of pepperoni on a slice of Arrabiata and it's a shame because they do take pride in ingredients and having signature pizzas. Needless to say I'm no vegan warrior, but this does need to be addressed."}
{"text":"Believe the hype kids. King Slice makes the best slice of pizza I've ever had in Toronto. The slices here make a travesty of the pizza at most other pizza joints in the city - Cora, Papa Ceo, I'm talking to you.  For $5 I picked up a giant slice of Arrabiatta that was perfect down to every last detail. First, the slice tasted as fresh as if it had come right out of the oven even though I went at a time when it wasn't busy. King Slice only has 5 different slice options and this seems to ensure freshness.  The crust was awesome. Crispy and flaky on the outside but not crunchy or overdone. Moist on the inside. Not too thick, never doughy, and with great flavour.  The sauce was well seasoned and there was a good amount of cheese. The toppings (jalapeno, garlic, and mushroom on the Arrabiata) were fresh and plentiful.  I'd eat this pizza even if it was served out of a dirt floored shack with a rat infestation. But, King Slice actually has a nice atmosphere; certainly better than most pizza joints. The space is clean and nicely decorated and there's seating for about 30. The staff were super friendly as well."}
{"text":"HUGE slices. I had the Marguerita. It was very yummy and super filling. Make sure to get the garlic/parsley sauce for the crust!"}
{"text":"Never again. It took 2 hours to receive and food was cold and burnt. When calling to let them know i received the worst customer service whatsoever. I would Not order from here again."}
{"text":"Obviously the slices were huge! Service is good and they are quick too! Fresh ingredients and not too greasy. Prices are reasonable too. Love the garlic oil they slather on when you ask too!"}
{"text":"I always get the arrabiata! This place is my go to pizza spot in downtown/queen west area. The staff are very fast and friendly."}
{"text":"big slice of pizza. Pretty good tasting."}
{"text":"Hands down the best margherita pizza (king slice). It should be the only slice you go for."}
{"text":"King Slice makes great pizza. It's two paper plates' worth of quantity and quality all in one hot, crispy, thin crusted slice. I love the fact that their menu is so concise. You really can't go wrong with any of the options. Although out of the many times that I have gone there, there has only been one instance in which Hawaiian was actually available, my default deluxe is nothing to complain about at all.   I wish that the Margherita had more basil on it most days, but that's because I do know how to cook (contrary to King Slice's presumptuous tagline \"you may not know how to cook but surely you know how to taste...\". I also wish that their forks and knives weren't so painfully dull. I even made up inside joke about King Slice that involves an E.T.-like finger raise to show and match indentations (from having to push those darn knives so darn hard) as a mid-meal finger break and cheers.  Disclaimer: My boyfriend holds the title of \"Co-Chief Pizza Appreciator\" on the \"I (heart) King Slice\" Facebook group. He and two friends started this group to show their dedication to the pizzeria years ago, before groups (let alone business pages) were even popular on the site. While I don't necessarily share his die hard dedication, I am very, very much a fan."}
{"text":"This place is ammazing. We were on our way out west and wwanted a quick bite for the road and yelp brought me here. The slices are massive and so cheesy w alot of flavour. i got the margarita pizza and oh bou it was the est ive ever had. the girl on cash recommended it because I dont eat meat and she did not disappoint. she was super friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"I tried King Slice for the first time tonight, and while it was definitely the biggest slice I've ever eaten, it tasted pretty average. It didn't taste as fresh or flavourful as I had expected, however the garlic oil was a nice touch!   I would consider trying this place again, but would probably opt for something other than pizza, their eggplant parm sandwich looked good!"}
{"text":"I thought it was pretty good for a HUGE slice of piazza! It was a little greasy but very yummy!"}
{"text":"First yelp review and I definitely had to review this place! Great value for money and pizza tasted amazing. I got the king special calzone and my partner got the Canadian calzone (which isn't on the menu). It was amazing value for money. $10 each and I even had leftovers for lunch too. A bit out of the way for us as we only went there after going to high park however just realised there's one closer to us so definitely will be checking that one out soon."}
{"text":"So there I was on National Pizza day searching for that perfect pizza pie. A BlogTO article from 2012 had this joint listed as one of the best pizza delivery places. I read some reviews and decided this was the place for my special dinner.  I placed my order opting for a medium Sicily and a medium with extra chess pepperoni and bacon. I decided to also ask for the garlic oil brushed crust I've heard recommended. 90 minutes and 3 phone calls later the pizza finally arrived.  One of the pizzas was burnt around the edge despite both of them being cold. The garlic oil on the crust was absent. The crust had the consistency of corrugated cardboard.  I actually ended up ordering pizza hut to make up for my disappointment (yes in the same night). My satisfaction was gained through an expensive mistake and with no help from this place"}
{"text":"Really good calzones - the garlic butter makes them! Slices are huge and the sandwiches in particular the meatball are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Holy moly, I love King Slice. I might even go so far as to say it's my favourite pizza in the city--but there is a lot I haven't tried, so I probably shouldn't...but I think I just did...?  Anyway, it truly is phenomenal, and (unlike a gripe I've had with some other places), the sit-in slices and the at-home deliveries have a quality and freshness that is consistent. I expect a pizza that is made to deliver to be, if anything, fresher and warmer than one that has been sitting under lights for any length of time, but for some reason, that isn't always the case.   They have a well-rounded list of ingredients (one of my favourite combos: chicken, goat cheese, fresh basil and tomato-- the chicken being the best chicken I've ever had on pizza, meaning the most tasting like actual chicken I would want to eat an entire piece of), and their pasta is also worth a try. The location is very close to a 'hood that factored very largely in my life the past year, so visits were (and still are) a-plenty, which is good because the sit-in servings are BIG. So big that you need 2 plates to put 'em on. Oh! And twice in a row a very pleasant girl has taken my order order over the phone, laughing good-naturedly when I can't find my credit card or almost drop my phone.   Pssst. I write all this to you with a slice in my hand. Does that make me biased?"}
{"text":"I think I am channeling both Jon M.'s first review and Chris G. lukewarm feeling on the Deluxe. I was in the area and decided to try King Slice after reading all the amazing reviews. My Deluxe slice was HUGE (king sized even, lol) To be honest I was starved and I couldn't even finish it!  The taste was good but nothing special. Maybe they were having an off day or maybe their Deluxe is lacklustre. In any case I am going to give this place the benefit of the doubt and try it again before I cast full judgement... King Slice, you have been put on notice!"}
{"text":"Yummmm  I came here for a quick slice because the other pizza place two doors down on the corner looked all but promising and their pizza looked wayyy fresher here and it was a couple steps away from the Drake hotel which is where I was staying.  I got the margarita pizza and the slice itself was HUGE and filling . I actually ended up splitting the slice with my friend. The woman at the register asked if I wanted garlic herb oil on top as well which I pondered if that was even a question #yesplease  It was delicious! The other slice I ordered was a supreme pizza which I don't like but I ordered because it was the other option for fresh by the slice. That one I honestly didn't enjoy so I only had a bite but I cant attribute that to king slice because I know I don't like it.  Great place if you want in and out service and a quick bite!"}
{"text":"This is the pizza you've been waiting for...and I've been waiting a month. Their prices better not go up after their renovations are complete, because it's the perfect price for a quality slice. Any more expensive and I won't have the change for an Aranciata.  The other comments are right, the slice is king, and the full pie doesn't hold up the walk home as well."}
{"text":"Service: The cashiers are always friendly and the service is quick. Great for a quick bite.  Ambiance: It's a small pizza shop catered to people on the go, or want some grease after the bar. There's probably around 12-15 seats in the shop, but most customers take it to go.  Food: There are only 4 options you can choose from the individual slices menu, but they are well made. I always go for the pepperoni and cheese option, as they put double the amount of pepperoni compared to normal shops. Their slices are huge too, hence the name King Slice, so unless you have a big appetite one slice is more than enough. You also need to put the garlic/parsley oil on your crust that they provide. It just brings your pizza to another level!"}
{"text":"This place sells good pizza for a stupid cheap price - so I'm always down! I got two \"slices\" (slice in quotes because one slice of the pizza is ridiculously huge and I don't think I could finish one on my own!), the Margherita and the Arrabiatta. I was originally looking more forward to the Arrabiatta, just because the toppings sounded really cool, but we both actually enjoyed the Margherita slice more. Only complaint is that it's nothing too special - it's not the best slice I've ever had - but for the price point, you can't really complain!"}
{"text":"been here after we moved tothe neighbourhood a few yrs ago, gave me heartburn for days which I don't remember when I have experienced before. also, they use some godawful tomato sauce (not house made of course, saw  those huge cans before trash pick up) which tastes very concentrated  and it's very dry too. only things I like are the mini patio, they're fast and open until midnight. not for me anymore though, two times were more than enough."}
{"text":"BIG slices, Pizza is okay, not that exceptional to be honest. I have tried their Arrabiata and Pepperoni, which were okay, but they have a nice little bistro-style ambiance at bloor west village with a great location. They also deliver! If you're looking to grab slice, this place is it!"}
{"text":"The slices are huge and delicious, definetely will keep you full and soak up some booze. There wasnt a lot of sitting space but there were patio tablws with umbrellas at the DQ around the corner. About $15 with two cans. Defibetely a great spot to eat and a ten minute walk to High Park."}
{"text":"My lifelong theory that a restaurant loses all credibility if its menu is riddled with typos has officially gone out the window.  King Slice's web menu has 38 typos on it. 38 typos. On one page of text. (if you don't believe me go see for yourself - http://www.kingslice.ca/Menu.html) Highlights include ground beff, chesse, oions/loions, permeasan cheese, beacon, totmatoes, fresj basil and creaser dressing.  The best part of the website is the disclaimer at the bottom of the page: \"KING SICE is not responsible for typographical or photographical errors.\" No, that's not my typo (I DON'T MAKE TYPOS, PEOPLE). It's King Slice's. They misspelled their own name. On their own website. In a disclaimer saying they're not responsible for typos.   I'm in hysterics.  Make no mistake though - while these people may not specialize in spelling (or proofreading), they most certainly specialize in making last-supper-worthy pizza. Like, to die for. I was astounded. Better than Terroni, Giordano's, Libretto, whatever. I ate the whole pizza in one night.   I ordered a small pizza with goat cheese (mm), tomatoes (mmm) and fresh (I mean \"fresj\") basil (mmmm). The girl taking my order was exceptionally friendly and professional. My pizza arrived in 30 minutes (it's literally down the street so this part didn't surprise me) in a plain white box with absolutely no name or branding on it. Guess they didn't want to take a chance on making more spelling mistakes.  Writing this review has made me so hungry that I just ordered again. I can't believe it's taken me this long living in the neighbourhood to order from King Slice. Goodbye Dominos!"}
{"text":"Slice of pizza - average. Greek salad - well below average. Wilted Romain and when they asked me why I didn't eat the salad, I told them the lettuce is all brown and wilted - their answer was simply sorry. Seriously? How about \"I'm so sorry, let me make you a fresh one or simply give your money back\"  I dont understand some businesses."}
{"text":"I spend pretty much all of my time with an American who whines a lot about Toronto pizza options. Cue me mimicking playing a tiny violin and taking a huge bite of delicious poutine.   We ordered a large pepperoni with a side of garlic dipping sauce. It arrived hot and fresh to our door in under 20 minutes, which has got to be a record. I very much like the crispy pepperoni on top of the gooey cheese, but they are a little shy on the sauce and it's quite a dough-y crust. If bread-y crust is your thing, this will probably be your dream come true!   Pizza is pizza, though, so I give this place four stars. Pizza my heart!"}
{"text":"Good slice of big pizza if you're super hungry. Dropped by lunch on a weekday and was greeted by friendly staff. Better than the big chain pizza places; I believe the place services only 4-5 kinds of pizzas. Would come back for more if I'm around the area!"}
{"text":"It gets 2 stars because it's just slightly better than Pizza Pizza next door.  For those who went to Vinny Massimo's... you would know the caprese pizza was one of the best slices in the city.  Period.  Sadly king slice doesn't live up Vinny's or any solo / small chain pizza joint in the city.    Avoid if possible... and if you're still hungry and in the area of Queen W, head to Barton's snacks, Fat Bastard Burrito or Poutinis.  Food * Service ** Ambiance *1/2 (out of ****)"}
