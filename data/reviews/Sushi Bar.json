{"text":"Not just sushi, but Japanese cuisine!! Every time I go here I have to pinch myself to believe that this place is in Madison, Indiana. The family that runs the restaurant are crazy friendly and amazing cooks. Yes, the location is in an old Wendy's, but I think it adds to the charm and if the food is great... I really don't care. 
If you have never tried sushi, this is a great place to start. A bento box has a sushi option that allows you to eat a mixture of Japanese food and if you don't like the sushi, you still get full. It's not just raw fish either, because there are many cooked options to choose from. 
If you like sushi, I enjoy the jaguar, yummy, Fujiyama, and Hoosier roll. I like to get one I have tried and always pick something different. I have never had a roll I didn't like. 
AMAZING! This places parking lot should be full everyday!"}
{"text":"Sushi Bar is a brand new addition to Leslieville.  They have taken over the location formerly occupied by SOMA Lounge right at the corner of Queen and Broadview.  If you are looking for reasonably priced sushi with a large menu, but nothing too fancy, this is your place.

Considering how brand new the place is, the service was quite good and the staff was very friendly.  We ordered a selection of fish and veggie sushi which was all extremely tasty with huge portions.  Everything was fresh and well presented.  The fact that they also threw in some really solid \"on the house\" appetizers left us happily stuffed.

Highlights included an amazing fried tofu and a really nice salmon and avocado roll.  The Rainbow roll and Veggie Dragon roles were massive in size and taste.

Considering 2 of us were able to stuff our bellies full and still had leftovers to take home, all for $40 (tax included), I'd say this place has a lot of potential to become a neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"Damnit sushi bar I really, really REALLY want to like you...nay, even love you! But you make it so effing hard!!

I live in the neighbourhood and have eaten her about 3 times, and ordered take out probably about 4-5 times. And every time something just isn't right! 
I say no tilapia, you give me tilapia.
I say spicy mayo, you charge me a $1 and then no spicy mayo
I say spicy salmon roll, you give me tuna. And one time, just the crunchy stuff and no fish.

Korean food is absolutely atrocious. as a Korean, when I'm desperate for kimchi and some kind of soup and am completely out of options, I grudgingly order soon tofu. Praying that it will comfort my kimchi craving soul. No such luck. Absolutely pathetic excuse for Korean stew. There was NO TOFU IN THE TOFU SOUP. You should be ashamed of yourselves.

So then, on a cold winter day I tell my boyfriend lets get udon, because TD freezing and I'm craving a warm hug for my belly. \"You can't fuck up udon\" I confidently state.

I was wrong. So so wrong. The udon was literally broth, noodles, two prices of broccoli, and one piece of onion. This is their Nabayaki people. And you forgot my California roll but obviously remembered to charge for it. 

You get the idea. To boot, there's one lady who does take out who appears to have some authority, is the rudest server I've ever seen. 

BUT I try to overlook all this because you're conveniently close, and the sushi is pretty good. 

Today was the last straw. They must have run out of miso soup because what I got is best described as salt water. No cloudy miso, not a speck of anything in the clear salty water.

Enough is enough."}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie dynamite + mango maki roll set. Overall, I was quite happy with this restaurant! The sushi was good quality. The green salad was as expected. I liked that they provided a lot of free side dishes (edamame, soup, deep-fried tofu etc.), especially since we were only 2 people. You definitely get a lot of food for what you're paying, so I would say it is definitely worth it. The sushis themselves are pretty big, too. Service was good - had three different employees regularly passing by to check on us. I am somewhat picky about sushi, but this is definitely a restaurant I will come back to."}
{"text":"Wow. Absolutely delicious sushi!! Great food, great service. Truly give it a try. And, what a wonderful sweet family that owns it."}
{"text":"Another 2.5 star review. It's becoming a trend.

Last night was my second visit to Sushi Bar. Leslieville/Riverside is SERIOUSLY lacking decent sushi. Seriously. 

Have been to Sushi District (good but expensive), Sushi Marche (don't understand the fuss, it was totally meh!) and have ordered delivery from a few places on the Danforth (TERRIBLE).

First time at Sushi Bar, we had Bentos. Terrible, mixed veggies was full of under-cooked onions, tempura was soggy (not hot enough oil) and meat was chewy in a bad way.

A few friends in the hood recommended trying it out again, for their rolls. 

Ordered a sushi and maki combo (8 sushi, 8 dynamite rolls), yellowtail sushi, spicy tuna maki & tofu skin roll.

Sushi was fresh, rolls good, I especially liked the spicy tuna. Overall the food was better than I anticipated but still not as good as many of the sushi places in the Annex.

My real problem with Sushi Bar was the service. It was slow and scattered, we had to flag down our waitress multiple times throughout the meal, first to order, then to ask for more water. Seems like they do more business in takeout than eat-in, and the staff works harder to keep up with phone orders than servicing the dining room."}
{"text":"I've been getting takeout from here for a few years now and it is always a good choice. However, the last two times I have dined in, I have woken up in the middle of the night running to the bathroom to throw up. Both times I had ordered sushi rolls and wakame salad. I've never experienced anything like it but it came on so suddenly."}
{"text":"As other reviewers made note, the building does not look like much, but the service and food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have eaten sushi across the city for many years. I had a favourite place, Vincent sushi, in my old neighbourhood of Roncesvalles village. Sadly the original chef and owner moved on to a new restaurant a while ago, and I have been searching for my new favourite sushi joint ever since.

Well I have found it! This place rocks. The fish here is fresh and tasty, and the portions are sizeable. I hate ordering nigiri at some sushi places and then you get a minuscule sliver of flavourless fish on a large ball of equally flavourless rice. Well not here!

The maki is also delicious. The spicy tuna roll is the highlight for me. Perfectly balanced, with spicy, sweet and savoury all well represented. 

I would recommend this place highly to anyone who loves sushi. Prices are reasonable for what you get. Try this place if you are sick of the bland boring AYCE places on college street and you want some great sushi but don't want to spend an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's one of my favourite Sushi places in the city not least of which is because as someone allergic to fish, they are amazing at ensuring that my food doesn't come in contact. I have NEVER gotten sick from here. Huge bonus points for cleanliness and customer accommodation. Their sushi is also great. I've even converted one of my sushi hating friends over to this place.

I've never dined in but take-out is fast and easy. I usually get an order of Avocado rolls, Cucumber rolls, Age Dashi Tofu (just ask them to leave off the fish scales), and a side of steamed rice. Unlike many sushi places who save a buck by using mostly sticky rice in their rolls, Sushi Bar loads them up on the vegetables and meats that they promise. So an Avocado roll? STUFFED full of yummy goodness. And the pieces are easy to fit in your mouth so no awkward overstuffed mouth. 

If you're in the east end I definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"We eat here once a week. Always have the lunch specials, which I think are fairly priced and pretty good. 
The fish always taste fresh and the rice is perfect. Service is funny and confusing at times, but never had any problems."}
{"text":"Huge veggie sushi selection with much more creativity than most veg selections. The interior is pretty cute. Take out and delivery- but no menu posted on the net. Trying to order by phone without the menu handy is pretty much impossible. Having said that- we keep the menu handy. Crunch mango roll and Pink Flower roll are my favourites- order with no mayo to make vegan."}
{"text":"Came back tonight cos, well I'm stupid.

Ordered take out. As I was waiting, the sushi chef prepared another customer's order and not once, but twice, ate some of the fish out of his fingers and then proceeded to continue preparing the sushi without washing his hands.

Spicy salmon maki with a side of saliva. 

Gross. Definitely not coming back now."}
{"text":"If you like your \"sushi\" made by Chinese staff who aren't real sushi chefs, or you don't know the difference between real sushi and crap, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Decent sushi in South Riverside community in Toronto.  Dine-in service is good, the food is always fresh.  The complimentary little bowl of noodles is quite tasty.

Delivery is also good.  The food doesn't sit around before delivery, so you get to eat the same quality of food in the comfort of your own home.  I noticed that the delivered maki rolls did not have softened nori by the time we actually sat down to eat."}
{"text":"Korean style chirashi is excellent. Along with the nigiri style sushi.  Always fresh.  Continue to come back."}
{"text":"Definitely the best sushi in Madison, Indiana! Not quite as good as that you get on the coast, but very, very good.  Great family atmosphere, and very friendly, attentive staff."}
{"text":"I've been here many times before but lately the quality of cuts isn't as good and they just give me lots of salmon"}
{"text":"If I was rating just for food, it would be 5 stars.  The restaurant is an old Wendy's, but as other reviewers noted, do not let this keep you from enjoying the food.  A great family runs this place.  Wonderful food.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"Several people had told us this was a great place, so we tried it tonight. We ordered 6 rolls, shrimp and veggie tempura and soba yaki. Everything was delicious! They have great sushi roll combos that are very reasonably priced, create your own bento boxes, extensive specialty and traditional rolls. The salmon was very fresh and delicious! They also have items like noodles, soups, katsu, and teriyaki. I cannot wait to go back and try new things! The service was also fast and friendly, not that I would have minded otherwise since the food was so good!"}
{"text":"Prices have gone up, quality has gone down. Such a shame. Seems to be a trend in this neighborhood lately."}
{"text":"not quite sure what the deal is with sushi.  it all tastes the same to me.  i mean how different can raw fish be in taste.  i can see a difference if the fish is straight out of lake ontario or something.   but seriously it's all the same to me.

however - and this is the catch here- sushi bar is my favourite place for sushi.  OK i'll be honest, i haven't been to too many sushi bars across the city, and im sure those places that charge hundreds of dollars are entitled to make your palate explode, but i have to say (again) that this is my favourite place for sushi.

the service is what it should be, but inside the restaurant is pretty cool.  yesterday i walked in for lunch and they were playing the japanese classic 7 samurai.  it hit me how this place is somewhat of the japanese version of the drake hotel.

anyways back to the food.  their salmon bento is pretty good.  i like the taste of charcoal in my food - but in this case i had both that and salmon massaging my mouth.  their sushi is pretty good too.  it doesn't really stand out in flavour - not quite sure if sushi should?  but i do enjoy it.  i really like their sticky rice because there is a hint of sweetness and with a little soya drizzled over the sushi, i think all these flavours go nicely together.  not overpowering, but very subtle.

anyhow, serivce, food, place = 2 thumbs up.  give it a try.... the price is more than decent and the food is good.  4 stars for sure."}
{"text":"We order delivery from this place on a pretty regular basis and overall it is good - they have a great sush pizza and their dynamite rolls are dynamite (sorry...)  The only reason I didnt give a higher score is that we have had a couple of experiences (but not on the same days so I dont know if there is a pattern) where the fish seemed not quite as fresh.  Not really bad mind you, but with raw fish you dont want any doubt.  With that said, 9 times out of 10 it has been solid..."}
{"text":"Great place, and didn't expect so many extras. Between ordering and when my sushi came I was given a fried banana with honey, noodle soup, miso soup, seaweed salad, house salad, and edamame."}
{"text":"Nine times out of 10 a sushi resto will create maki and sushi with way too much rice.  Sushi Bar has both fresh-tasting fish and excellent fish-to-rice ratio: noticeably larger portions of fish compared to other sushi places in the downtown core.  Try any salmon maki, spicy rainbow roll and yam & avocado maki with brown rice.  The decorating is pretty nice as well."}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE!!! I've never written a bad review before but this place is awful. I ordered the dancing unagi (eel) roll and it had no unagi in it!!  Most of it tasted and smelled not fresh... Save your money and don't eat from this dreadful place."}
{"text":"Food and wait staff here are excellent. All of the sushi is fantastic. Highly recommend the bento boxes. Unlike most places you get to choose your sushi roll in the bento box. Fantastic sushi here. Everything is awesome here."}
{"text":"I come at lunch time and the price for the agedashi tofu bento box is quite reasonable. There is this nice soup that comes with your meal, very thin noodles in it with some of the tempura bits in it. But it was really good. The portion size was decent too. I really enjoyed my agedashi tofu box, plus the small appetizers that come with it. The service is also very friendly and quick. I will continue to come here for sure."}
{"text":"My friend always orders from here but I have yet to have a good experience. First tome we ordered from uber eats and the second time we sat at the restaurant. As for uber eats, let's just say that their sushi doesn't travel well. Their sushi pizza (which is supposed to be crispy rice with raw salmon on it) had soggy rice and the salmon had cooked because it was out on the rice when it was still warm. The other sushi just was nothing special. When we sat there it just got worse. Their servers have no idea what is on their menu. I pointed at a picture that was not marked as an item and the server couldn't figure out what it was. Then I asked the difference between two salmon sashimi options and they had no idea. When the salmon did come out I literally had to spit it out. Was not fresh at all. I'm going to avoid it here."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on our way through town and everything was amazing. Even the salad dressing (which I'm usually not a fan of at Japanese restaurants) was the best I've ever had. The Gyoza was delicious and only $3.50 for 5 dumplings. All the sushi rolls we had were really good. No wait either. A great spot."}
{"text":"Had takeout. Was supposed to get 10 percent discount for cash takeout, they charged regular price until I called them out on it. Missing rice with my sashimi dinner when I opened the bag. Asked for low sodium soy sauce when I was leaving, woman claimed it was already in bag. When I opened bag was regular soy sauce. Seriously, is lying to save 5 cents on soy sauce worth it? Just shows what a scam this place is.

Oh and the sashimi is low quality garbage similar to the all you can eat places. Except those places would be half the price. Cheapest cuts of fish, the salmon tasted off. Be warned."}
{"text":"Spacious Sushi Bar was a great early lunch option when I was in the area on a Sunday with my fellow coffee-crawling Yelpers. Not a small group, we were for some reason seated at the back of an empty restaurant, but nevertheless given enough attention.

The menu is HUGE - \"you could probably do some damage smacking someone with it\"-kinda huge. There were loads and loads of lunch special offers (endless sushi platters & bento boxes) plus the regular menu. I ordered some rolls from the pretty extensive vegetarian section of the main menu, and they were pretty decent. Everyone got a great little cup of (vegetarian) noodle soup with puffed rice, and also some shared plates of agedashi tofu as standard, which was a really lovely (and tasty) touch.

Other points to mention: 10% on takeout would be handy if you live in the area; the washrooms look like they've been transplanted from a nightclub, only clean; music ranged from Kenny-G-esque easy listening cover songs to bluegrass; prices could do with being $1 - 2 cheaper per item.

A solid 3.5 stars - if i'm in the area again i'll consider it an option, but Bloor's sushi-land offers more to me."}
{"text":"Hey, Sushi Bar, it's the year 2012! I think it's time to get a menu on to the Internet, especially since you have take out and delivery. Much to the chagrin of my life partner, I am not returning to this place for a long time. I won't say it's a lifelong ban because that's a little melodramatic. 
I ordered for pick up one of the vegetarian roll sets. Running low on cash, I opted for the very dull yam roll, avocado & cucumber roll and avocado roll set. I'm against ordering sushi with fruit (in this case mango which affects me in a very unpleasant gastralintestinal way). I pick it up and notice it costs the same as the fish maki set. Is there a cucumber shortage? Should an uninspiring veggie roll set cost as much as a fish rolll set?
This was an omen that the meal was going downhill. I get home and find some kind of mango roll! Okay, maybe it's not something to send someone into a rage over but I'm pregnant and I was damn hungry so I felt like overturning the dining room table like the incredible hulk. 
I called them and discovered the takeout menu I had (which wasn't that old) had changed. Why?! Sure, confuse people and just move this veggie roll set up a number. Why not just change the lettering system so people who have the older version don't get so pissed off when they find mango in their sushi roll. Fruit, I repeat, has no place in a sushi roll (ok, avocado excepted so no sweet fruit should be in sushi). 
After my fit of rage, I begrudgingly ate the yam roll and a&c roll. They were cold and it tasted like the yam tempura had been prepared hours before. The rice was a bit hard too. I'm not being nitpicky because of my massive disappointment up to this point. The sushi was pretty crappy!
So Sushi Bar, I part ways with you for an undetermined amount of time. Maybe when I return, you'll have an updated menu online."}
{"text":"Yikes,

There was something seriously wrong with the food here. Everything kinda tasted meh and wasn't as fresh as you want in a Sushi place. Yelpers beware!"}
{"text":"Sushi Bar is my go to delivery sushi when Friday night come faster than you expect and youre  lining up Netflix bingefest. Everything I've had so far from there has been good. The litmus test for me in a Sushi place is the Spicy Salmon the establishment offers, and this place definitley checks that box for me. 

I also like that the ratio of fish to rice in each item. Been living in the city for over a year now and this is my go to place for sushi satisfaction"}
{"text":"What to get: chicago roll, spicy salmon roll
Service: 5/5

BEST sushi in Madison, IN. I always love coming here at lunch time to get the 3 sushi roll special for just $10 (that's a steal!), the sushi is ALWAYS fresh & delicious. The raw fish is very well prepared & preserved. The staff is always so nice & helpful with things on the menu if you have any questions. They also have a bento box where you can choose which sushi roll you would like which is really great. I haven't tried a bad sushi roll here yet! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Sushi Bar is one of those happy accidents where we randomly walked in without any idea what we were getting into and discovered something great!  

From the exterior, you wouldn't have expected that the interior is actually very modern, with décor leaning toward dark, sleek and calming.  It is a surprisingly big space and I've always been seated immediately.  With the entrance located right behind a bus shelter on the south west corner of Queen Street West and Broadview, Sushi Bar is very accessible by streetcar.  There is free parking on the street on Broadview generally after 6pm right around the corner.

The maki and sushi here are very fresh and tasty.  As a heavy indulger in maki, I was impressed with the thin, rather than unacceptably thick, layer of rice wrapping the delicious ingredients.  The bits of avocado in the maki are huge.  On this occasion, I had the Roll Set 2 that consists of 8 dynamite rolls and 8 spicy rolls.  Mmm... so good!  

The meals come with snacks like miso soup, a yummy noodle cup, and various things like spicy bean sprouts and chilled deep fried tofu.  There are various Asian-style pub specials like a pitcher of beer with 4 chicken wings or 4 takoyaki (I think!) for $20.95. 

I would definitely go out of my way for another visit!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised, it looks super shady on the outside but the food was delicious.  I would defiantly eat here again"}
{"text":"Sushi Bar is a brand spanking new Japanese restaurant at the corner of Queen & Broadview (across from Jilly's).  Sushi Bar offers a huge menu - including a wide selection of vegetarian options. The fish was fresh & tasty, the tempura was crisp and the overall experience was quite enjoyable! The price was definitely right - $40 for 2 people (and we had leftovers). 

Sushi Bar has only been open for about a week, so it was quiet when we got there (also a little on the early side), but I do expect that in the next little while business will be booming for them. Good thing they've got a lot of seating :)"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I patronize this place regularly in a variety of capacities: 10$ take out lunch which includes a perfect portion of sushi, salad, and miso. Or for long, lazy sushi sit-downs when our bosses have effed off early on Fridays. Or for emergency giant Bowls of Udon when we are hungover. 

The 10$ lunch special is available as eat-in or take-out, but when you have time to sit down you are rewarded with a nicely paced parade of edamame, noodle soup, then miso, then salad, then your lunch, then oranges.

I've never had anything but tasty food here. My dining companions have never complained either. I guess there isn't enough salt on the edamame but my palette is shot. 

The menu is huge and there is absolutely something for everyone. It's pleasantly and reassuringly busy but even large groups can usually get a table (we try to do reservations when we are 5+.) The decor is very tidy and relaxing. They always ask if you want to split the bill and offer quick card payments at table, which is always appreciate when you are eating with coworkers and friends.

They let us call our orders in early too, if we like, making it a really great option for us.

Love it!"}
{"text":"I was passing through town doing a side job.  I admit I was hesitant of a Sushi place in this area.  I'm so glad I tried it.  Delicious!!!!  I'm not really excited about the Miso soup, but the spicy crab roll, avocado roll and Philadelphia roll were amazing! Yummy alert!"}
{"text":"I loved the food. It was really good. 
They have nice separations into 6 Person settings which visibly blocks the rest of the restaurant and also worked very well with just my wife and son. They provide high chairs.
Very cozy and gives you more privacy than most others.
Very friendly staff.
My coupon (Groupon or Teambuy, I don't remember) didn't cover the whole bill, but they said: Don't worry about it! (What?)
So I left a very nice Tip and will be back..."}
{"text":"clean, fresh, good value and lots of variety.  I work nearby and come here often.  The free service appetizers are good too."}
{"text":"Decent place..decor is better than what I expected.. ..price is a bit high..the portion of steamed rice was also small..but the miso and complimentary noodle was really good. 

I think they deliver too."}
{"text":"I was just in town for a few days and saw the positive reviews on yelp so I stopped in. The guys were super helpful and friendly and the food was great. I had the Fujiyama roll and Tiger roll. Both were good but the Tiger was my favorite. Just the right amount of crunch and spice. I would definitely come here again. I'm no sushi snob, but I thought it was yummy."}
{"text":"This was very affordable and delicious. Staff was kind and our food came out quickly. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place is just down the street from my office so I have been here many times to pick up  one of their lunch specials.   For about $12  you can walk away with a nice bento box or 2 rolls including soup and an appetizer.

I have also been here for team lunches and can easily accommodate a party of 12 people.  If you have this many people, get 3 boats and a few orders of tempura and you will be full for about $20 a head.

Only 3 stars because I find the staff slow and inattentive.  You always have to ask for more water, or food. They never come by to see how you are doing or if you need any extras."}
{"text":"I've been to this Korean-run Japanese restaurant a few times over the years. It's right in front of your face when you get off an eastbound streetcar at Queen and Broadview, and across the street from the disgustingly ancient Jilly's strip bar.

For an east-end commercial space, the restaurant is incredibly huge and can accommodate large groups, through the place is never packed. The decor is clean and dark, modern Asian, with dividers splitting much of the space, and usually top 40 pop music filling it. The menu is extensive, yet very typical of a sushi restaurant. The food ranges from okay to yummy. Never impressive, but relatively inexpensive. 

They will in a typical sitting serve you miso soup and some side dishes, like in a Korean restaurant. The sides seems to be random and usually sitting-around-for-a-while-cold--edamame and cooked bean sprouts, and at one time, even kimchi. I think this sides thing is an influence of the establishment's Korean owners.

The service quality varies. It may be attentive some days, or slow and ignorant on others.

If I am craving some sushi or a stomach-stuffing bento box and could care less where it's coming from, this place will do, not too far from home.

{TTC: Any Queen or King streetcar to Queen/Broadview. Eastbound cars literally dump you right in front of this place.}"}
{"text":"We were here earlier this evening, and of course, we ordered too much again.
The selection of rolls here is large.  Today we settled on a Crunchy Spicy Salmon Roll, maybe a CN Tower roll (it had unagi in it), the Pacific Roll and the Skydom Roll, plus a veggie tempura appetizer.  I can safely tell you, that it was too much food.

I think the quality of the food is ok, but what I really like is the variety there are no less than 4 pages of rolls to choose from, given many of them are mild variations of each other, it's always interesting to try something new from here.

It was delish."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place in town!! Went for the first time last night for dinner and were all very satisfied. Even though it was a Friday night, the restaurant was empty other than one other couple...maybe because the restaurant just recently opened? Our waitress was attentive and friendly. We tried some of the more basic rolls: the blackened tuna roll, spicy asparagus roll, shitake mushroom roll, salmon skin roll, sweet potato roll, spicy tuna roll, and the philly roll. The sweet potato and spicy rolls didn't have sauce over them, so we asked for the sauce on the side and our waitress was really nice about it. The salmon skin roll wasn't great, but the other rolls were very fresh and tasted great. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Sushi Bar doesn't look like much on the outside, since it is an old Wendy's. But once you sit down and order the food is out of this world. And the lunch specials were a great deal. We were on our way to Clifty Falls for the day and was checking Yelp for a place with good reviews and lots of stars. So glad we stopped in.

My husband ordered the 2 rolls special that came with soup or salad. He picked the spicy crab and a California roll and salad. I ordered the bento box with chicken teriyaki, fried rice and a shrimp tempura roll. It also came with miso soup and a salad. The only thing I didn't like was all of the onions under my chicken breast. I am not an onion eater. So I could have done without them. But everything else was great. And the food was beautiful! Since you eat with your eyes first, just look at the pictures. You will be hungry for sushi. 

If we are back in Madison Indiana we will go back. Great food nice staff and reasonably priced. Works for us!"}
{"text":"There were four of us, we dined on a Tuesday night just before Christmas. They underestimated how busy it would get and there were only two waitresses on to serve a 3/4 full house. We experienced a bit of slowness but it wasn't too bad, at least they were always super polite about it. We had a mixture of items, my favourite was the spicy salmon and spicy crab hand roles. They serve tall cans of Asahi beer for 8.95. The meal was overall very enjoyable and cost $100.00 + tip."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from Sushi Bar for about 5 years and the quality and freshness of their food is top notch. We are creatures of habit and usually order the Love Boat Sushi and Sashimi (for two). The rolls are fresh, the nigiri are the correct size, the flavours are clean and balanced. Occasionally we will add to our order: sushi pizza, crispy salmon skin hand roll, extra sashimi, too. The service is very fast, friendly and accommodating. The menu is also very well priced."}
{"text":"I have to say the food here was amazing!  The service was excellent. The outside may look a little off setting but don't let that fool you. I have frequented Yomatos  ever since I moved to this area and after finally trying out this place I feel like there a strong possibility that I'll be visiting this sushi establishment more often"}
{"text":"Don't let the looks fool you, this is the best sushi in Madison! The couple that runs the place are very courteous and the food is excellent. I haven't found a better sushi place within 60 miles!"}
{"text":"We came across this place after wandering down Queen St. E. one night, and am I ever glad we did! They have some of the freshest sushi I've tasted, a wide selection of sashimi, and awesome service to boot. 

Right across from Jilly's, the facade of Sushi Bar is pretty unassuming, and despite all the times I've passed by before, I never really gave it a second glance (no, *not* because I was distracted by the full length posters plastered on the other side of the street). Once you get inside though, you'll realize it's definitely a step above your average, cookie cutter, all-you-can-eat sushi joint.

I really liked the lanterns and the embroidered hangings they had over the bar. Sure, the characters were on the lanterns were Chinese rather than Japanese, but then again, the owners are neither, Korean in fact...just call it pan-asian fusion! The plastic screens dividing the booths are a nice touch and add a bit of privacy to your meal.

I'd definitely recommend getting the Love Boat platter, it has a nice variety of rolls (some spicy ones too, mmm) and fish, plus offers good value if you're going in for dinner. Also really loved their miso soup. Normally I shy away from the overly salty brew, but Sushi Bar added a cute little bundle of thin noodles to theirs, yum! 

Our server was attentive and constantly smiling; she really helped make it a memorable experience. I'd definitely come back here again, even if only to hear her say \"Sapporo piiitcher?\"...err, I mean, to try the unagi! Open until 2 AM, this is the perfect place to drop in and refuel on some real food during those summer all-nighter adventures!"}
{"text":"I was really excited when I learned that a Japanese place was moving in only a block away from me.  Finally, sushi without the commute!!!

Sushi Bar is good.  It's not the best I've had, but it's usually solid though not particularly inventive.  Though I often will do the Love Boat take out after a long day at work, I do prefer eating there.  I really like the noodle with tempura flake appetizer they bring gratis.  The five or six edamame that accompany it always makes me smile.

In regards to service, generally it's pretty good.  One time we went and sat in one of the booths near the back of the restaurant, they forgot that we were there.  When they realized their mistake, they were very apologetic.  I blame it on those dividers.  I learned my lesson and I always try to take a table closer to the front where we are more visible.  

The space is attractive, but it's also large.  Sometimes that's a good thing since there's lots of room, but other times it makes it feel a little empty.  At least you never have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Just wow! Sushi Bar is incredible. Its super disappointing to see empty tables all over but the upside is getting a seat is no problem. The chef is incredible. Definitely top of my list for sushi bars and this place is up against some tough competition from San Diego to Palm Desert. Small rice portions underneath generous fish pieces. The rolls were inventive and delicious as well.   If you know good sushi you won't be disappointed.  If you don't know good sushi-come here!  They'll show you.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"There is something lacking in Sushi Bar's sushi.... I love the deco, the ambiance, the service (it was lacking in the beginning, but after I complained then all good from then on), the quantity, but the quality of the food was very disappointing! 

Sushi Dinner 1 ($17.95) 
- 9 pieces of nigiri and a choice of either Spicy Tuna/Salmon 
- the fish was not too fresh...and was slice really thin and each sushi made with huge ball of rice 
- no wasabi at all in any sushi... I know some Japanese restaurant will ask if you prefer not to (Mikado does that) but Sushi Bar is one of the first one that I been to that does not put any wasabi inside. 
- the Tuna Spicy roll was just so so.. the spiciness is really from the spicy mayo on top... 
- The shari rice was not made properly, as I notice it really lack the taste of rice vinegar... 

I do like the nice touch that my meal came with a lot of appetizers: soup with tempura bits and noodle, edamane, pickled bean sprouts and teriyaki tofu. And an ice cream to finish off... 

Those Japanese screens does provide some privacy.. but if you need the attention of the wait staffs.. you really have to scream and wave them down... 

As Sushi Bar is right across from Jilly's, I don't feel too safe and comfortable coming here after dark....."}
{"text":"Expensive sushi for what they offer. 
Sashimi combo costs $23 and doesn't come with rice (I had asked if it did and they said yes). Next, I asked for a side of spicy mayo, they said $1 extra. 

I don't appreciate it when a restaurant nickel and dimes me. 

I just moved into the neighbourhood and it was my first time there, also my last time there."}
{"text":"Sushi Bar at Broadview and Queen is as close to a local sushi/izakaya place as I could get. I have fancy, gourmet sushi around the corner from my place so sometimes I like the calm, sushi-all-the-time-with-decent-prices feel of Sushi Bar. 

They always start off with a bunch of try-ems. Tonight is was a small noodle soup, edamame, cellophane noodle salad and the neighborhood friendly deep fried tofu. I've had a bunch of other little bites here, and usually the spicy bean sprouts are my favourite (regardless of how Korean they feel) but tonight I took the time to enjoy the savory marshmallow qualities in the tofu. 

Because I was in a real sushi mood, I only ordered tuna tataki, yellowtail sushi, salmon sushi and unagi sushi. 

The tataki showed up looking like tuna tartar on corn chips. The waitress admitted to me that she made a mistake and asked me if I would like the tartar dish instead. I politely declined and asked for what I had ordered. 

When I received my sushi and tataki they were very hardy, filling pieces of fish. I wouldn't order the tataki again. Maybe I should take the corn chip substitute next time.

My bill still ended up being ridiculously high for one person. Maybe I should read it next time."}
{"text":"Me and a sizeable group of yelpers descended upon this Riverdale sushi spot on a Sunday afternoon. It's a long space with heaps of seating and cute Japanese screens dividing booths. It's clean and very sleek.

The menu is a bit hard to understand. There were lunch specials, premium bento boxes, regular bento boxes, teriyaki, and so forth. I managed some spicy rolls and sushi. Our waitress (who was attentive and quick) brought over some complimentary appetizers including a delicious noodle soup, miso soup, and deep fried tofu.

My sushi was so-so. I liked the sushi but my rolls were soft in the middle. A huge turn-off. That said, from the strength of the appetizers and their expansive menu, I'm sure they have solid options here. Might just take some experimenting -- or culling the menu of subpar options.

I would return.

Obligatory Title Pun: This BAR'S NONE too shabby.

Menu Readability: A tonne of different typefaces, bold and italics thrown hither and thither, weird unaligned leaders, and too many colours. It's atrocious.

Need to mention: \"Brown rice available for extra dollars.\"

What this place teaches me about myself: Brown costs more, baby."}
{"text":"This place is awful and over-priced. I ordered the lunch box with beef teriyaki and the beef was so so so hard that I couldn't chew them and had to spit them out. And guess what? I paid $17 for this damn lunch box dish. The service was not good either since the waitress didn't even give us water. Save your money and DO NOT go to this place or you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Gosh, do I ever love listening to the likes of Hanson (\"Isn't It Weird?\") , Britney Spears (\"Lucky\") and Robbie Williams (\"Millennium\") while slurping up salty broth and munching on sushi bites!

This place is brand new (open only a month) and the decor is beautiful. They have lovely wallpaper, paper lamps, private booths separated by Japanese-style screens and it's very clean. 

My friend ordered the sushi and sashimi plate ($25) and while he said it was pricey, his eyes were bugging out of his skull for the duration of the meal. 

I also love all of the little extras that you get at Korean and Japanese restaurants. We ordered edamame and the sushi plate, but we also got salad, two types of soup, crispy tofu cutlets and some other weird cabbagey thing. There is never an explanation as to what's what, you just dig in.

The meal was capped off with freshly prepared orange segments. I loved that touch!

Note: This is a sushi restaurant operated by Koreans, if this is important to you."}
{"text":"I really like this a la carte sushi place. Whenever I go in though it is so slow, which is good for me.

I ordered the sushi combo #2 which came with 9 pieces of assorted sushi and 8 pieces of California roll. It also came with a salad (or miso soup if you wanted), a mini noodle soup, and a fried tofu appetizer which was great! It came to about $20 for me after taxes.

Great value, great service, and great food."}
