{"text":"Staff were friendly food was great. We had the chicken tacos, Philly sandwich and loaded fries. Would have given a five star rating however the fries were a little undercooked."}
{"text":"Best Food Truck around!!!!!  I've seen them at Gilbert food truck events, scottsdale downtown and at the Cardinals games.  The staff is so amazing and friendly!  Best part is the food.... The cash, the chubby checker and the jerry lee are all my favorites!  Full of flavor and warmed my belly!  If you are looking for the best truck in town look for Rock A Belly!  Chef Chrissy is amazing!"}
{"text":"I am so glad this truck was selected for our company party!  Super food, great service, all around A+."}
{"text":"Rock-A-Belly is amazing! They recently catered for our wedding and we couldn't have asked for a better partner. The food was fantastic and the setup was beautiful; every single one of our 95 guests had complimentary things to say about the food, buffet-style setup and service. Jordan and his crew were truly great - Jordan knew that as the bride and groom, my wife and I would have a hard time sneaking away for a quick bite so he prepared a tray of apps just for us, which he brought all the way out into the desert for us as we were finishing our post-ceremony photos. Then he set us both up with a full plate of tacos each, which he had waiting for us at our sweetheart table. It was a really thoughtful gesture that we both really appreciated. I can't say enough good things about Rock-A-Belly. Delicious food, streamlined setup and awesome, personable people! If we had it to do over again, there would be no one else we'd consider calling. Thanks again Jordan!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Took forever to get it. Not overly busy at the gilbert good truck event but we had to wait 20mins for our food. The guy at the register was less interested in the people and more interested in bantering with the other good truck owner."}
{"text":"We had Rockabelly cater our wedding and it was absolutely amazing. We had a backyard wedding and they added perfectly to the ambiance of the night. First of all, the food is amazing! Everyone raved about it and still rave about how delicious it was, especially the nachos. My husband and I didn't get to eat much but I asked Jordan to box us up some tacos for later and that is exactly what he did! They were just as good the next day! Hiring Rockabelly for the wedding was the best choice we made and on top of how good the food was, Jordan was completely accommodating the whole time leading up to the wedding and always answering my millions of questions, even if I had asked them once before! So patient and so excited to help in any way he could. We are so happy with the experience and would recommend this food truck to anyone!"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed their food at the Tempe Festival of the Arts, and it was delicious! The Willie Nelson was a great eat and tasted fantastic! I even had to go back for more when I was finished! I highly recommend grabbing food from Rock A Belly whenever possible!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best customer service I've gotten in years. Very friendly and fast! The food was amazing. I got The Cash, which was $8. I feel this was fair for the amount of food I received. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best food truck. We used them for my twins 1st birthday and Rock a Belly was amazing. Arrived before our party started and was ready to go when guests arrived. All entrees came out in about 3mins and food was flowing. 

Everyone raved about the food. Guests ordered right off the regular menu and they met all guest request gluten free, kids menu items, vegetarian etc.

Attitude of the owners and chef were great we could have not asked for anything more."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere that this truck brings. Not to mention the food is good. Love the tacos"}
{"text":"Had the Mash Pit fries with chicken. Asked for the fries to be cooked longer than usual so they'd be crispy yet soft inside and I'm glad I did. Hefty portion with decent flavor. I was expecting a bit more from the chicken but would still recommend it. Just add hot sauce or ketchup!"}
{"text":"I feel like it's been forever you guys came to Liberty Mutual for Food Truck Wednesdays. Had the Chubby Checker ... still amazing, gotta be one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. And must agree with review by B. Moody, your order guy is super friendly, love the service and the music. Come back soon!"}
{"text":"Found this truck in Queen Creek Friday night. They had more people on line than the other trucks plus they had interesting menu. Debating over the Chubby Checker cheese steak or Big Bopper. Wife and I both chose the Big Bopper for $8 and fries for $3. When we got the food thought they made a mistake. No burger. Just finely ground chop meat sitting on an oversized flat pita covered with tomatoes, some lettuce, parsley, and I'm guessing some sort of mustard and mayo sauce. We both got three bites through it and gave up before throwing the rest out. Tasteless meat and the sauce is still repeating on me. Fries were ok but we didn't just drop $20 to have French fries for dinner. Truly disappointed and felt totally ripped off."}
{"text":"The Jerry Lee taco is my favorite! Nice big portions for a good price. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"These tacos are amazing!! The meat is super tasty and the pico de gallo was so fresh and delicious! Can't wait to have some more of these tacos!"}
{"text":"We hired Rock A Belly for our daughter's graduation party and had around 50 guests. This was the best decision! They were prompt and the food was seriously amazing! Our guests were raving about how delicious it all was. We had a few guests with dietary restrictions and Rock A Belly took such good care of them!! I will definitely be having them to our next party. 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"These folks were and are awesome! Loved to food and the hospitality they offer. My tattoo shop had a benefit early this month for Cystic Fibrosis and we wanted to have a food truck to feed all of our guests. Not only we they punctual but they make great food. I had the Chubby Checker and the mosh fried. Out FREAKING standing!! Very fresh tasting food with great flavors all around. Fully recommend these folks for your private function or if you see em around, stop! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I thought it was a BBQ truck. I didn't know what to get and asked the cashier to surprise me. He ordered me the chubby checker and it was awesome! Had I seen their menu I never would have tried it. I urged a few people in the office to try the food and everyone enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Wasn't a fan of the big bopper. It was pretty bland other than the overpowering taste of yellow mustard. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. Unfortunately, I don't think I will bother trying any of their other tacos for fear of repeated disappointment."}
{"text":"Rock a Belly is a lot of fun!  Great atmosphere and friendly people.  I've tried the shaved ribeye tacos, and they were good, but the Willie Nelson is really something special.  The falafel is delicious and I loved the cilantro tzatziki!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Rock A Belly for some time now and I'm glad I finally did. It was a windy Saturday night at the Scottsdale Food Truck Caravan and the Jerry Lee steak tacos sounded delicious. Knowing exactly what we wanted, my husband and I each ordered The Jerry Lee ($8 each). The tacos came with ribeye, cheese, cabbage, pico de gallo, and sour cream on corn tortillas. The tacos were delicious. The flavors blended well together and the meat was tender and flavorful. All entrees come with a side of freshly made tortilla chips. These were delicious and helped scoop up any of the taco filling that might have fallen out during eating. The employee who served us was friendly and the service was fast. Overall, I really liked the tacos and I would definitely order them again. In case steak tacos are not your thing, there are several other items on the menu (chicken tacos, sandwiches, sides, etc) and you can build your own."}
{"text":"Wow what an awesome experience! Rockabelly was a guest food cart at our community event. Out of the two carts invited, this one was by far the fastest, friendliest, best quality, and all around an awesome set up. My daughter and I enjoyed several of the main features including the cheeseburger, steak taco, and the amazing fries with lots of goodies on top. The gentleman ( I believe the owner) who took our orders was friendly, and patience with our questions. He gave good recommendations. The Food was VERY good, and the portions were large enough to fill us up! Highly recommend, don't miss out!!"}
{"text":"The chicken tacos were tasty, but the portions are SMALL! I just finished my food (2 little tacos) and I'm still hungry. I'm a small lady, imagine if I were a big guy. For $8, I expect to get full. It'd be better if the tacos came with a side of rice and beans and some salsa for the tortilla chips, or give at least 3 tacos. Now I have to get more food some place..."}
{"text":"Every week there's a different food truck at my work and Rock A Belly is one of them. I love the art on their truck it really makes them stand out from your basic food truck. Service is great and they are always willing to answer any question so I can figure out what I might like. I tried the chicken tacos. They were good, but not my favorite. I'd definitely try something different though."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing taco today when your food truck came to my office!!!  Wish you would open a restaurant!  I am a very picky eater, and this taco was truly one of the best ever!"}
{"text":"On October 9th, my wife and I had Rock-A-Belly cater our wedding.  To say Jordan and his team did a fantastic job would be an understatement.  These guys have been our favorite Food Truck in the Valley since we found them and the experience they provided us and our guests at the wedding did not disappoint.

The guests raved about the variety of food they had available and both the kids and adults loved the 'Mosh Pit Fry Bar' that they had setup for everyone.

If you haven't tried their food truck yet, go to their Facebook page each week to find out where they will be working and go.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  If you've already been, then you know what I'm talking about.  This is just another reason they are our favorite food truck and will continue to be so for years to come.  Thank you Jordan and the Rock-A-Belly family for making our wedding extra-ordinary and, from the words of our guests....'Best...Wedding...Ever!!!'"}
{"text":"Was out looking for a job and decided to treat myself to lunch . . . even though I am watching every penny . . . and decided to try a Food Truck . . . since I have wanted too for some time.

Well guess what . . . I happened to spot Rock-A-Belly in the parking lot of a local business in the area I was job searching.  Ordered the Chubby Checker and a Coke . . . The sandwich was off the hook . . . full of flavor, hot, and very tasty . . . and don't get me started on their signature chips . . . I could eat those things all day.  The only thing wrong was that the soda wasn't as cold as I usually like . . . but what can I expect for being the first customer o the day.

I will definitely be stopping back again . . . keep Rocking . . . Rock-A-Belly . . ."}
{"text":"Still happy I chose this food truck over the other options that night. 
The rest seemed more the generic variety and not offering anything special. 

I appreciated Rock-A-Belly's more unique offerings setting themselves apart from the other options.  

I had the Mash Pit fries, they had good flavor but also were not very crispy at all, which left me a little disappointed for the price.  I think if they were cooked longer they could have been really good.  

I also had the Chubby I think.  And it was good though the meat seemed a little dry to me.  

Not writing this be harsh in anyway, the even we were had was packed and I was still happy with my choice over the others offered.  If the fries were cooked longer the meat was a little juicer or had more flavor to them and not just flavorful sauce on top, this would be 4 stars for sure.  Food did come out quick which was nice considering how many people were at the event."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! ! Had the Chubby Checker. Enough meat,  veg and sauce fell out while I was eating it that I had dippin's for the crispy flour tortilla chips that come with it, BONUS FOR ME!  
It's two, two, two meals in one!  Although this sandwich was not a healthy choice (by my choice), I'll definitely eat here again so I can try something else."}
{"text":"Had the Rock A Belly Truck for our twins first birthday party. Showed up early and was serving food when the first guest arrived.  Killer food , great vibe and the owner Jordan and Chef Chrissy Rock. Served 46 guests during a 2 hr party and wait time for the cooked to order food was 3 min tops. Food was out quick and very consistent. As in consistently good all 5 different entrees.  Everyone loved the food and did not hear anything negative had lots people ask how they can find them again. Both chicken and steak tacos were great. My favorite is the cubby checker cheese steak. Rock bread with salt infused wine was killer. Go for the side chips w the salt if you don't love fries. Highly recommend for A bite to eat or for a rocking Party!

{"text":"I wish I could give 100 stars, 25 thumbs ups, and 50 high fives because Rock A Belly was simply amazing! They catered our wedding a few weeks ago, and the wedding guests are still raving about the delicious food that was served up. Jordan was such a pleasure to work with prior to the big day, and he took such great care of my husband, myself, and our wedding party when we were in desperate need of food in between the ceremony and picture taking. If you're looking for delicious food, fabulous service, and overall an amazing catering experience then definitely look into Jordan and his incredible crew! Even if you're looking for a rad food truck with delicious options then hunt down where the truck will be, because you will not be disappointed! Thank you so much guys"}
{"text":"Food truck came by the building I was at and looked them up online. They had rave reviews so 'I'm im trying them. Ordered the Mosh Pit fries with Shaved Rib Eye, Wow is all I can say. A lot of food for $8 and Im very full at the moment which is rare with food trucks. Next time im going order double meat that shaved rib eye is like heaven. One of the few trucks that makes my mouth water when I think of fries and rib eye"}
