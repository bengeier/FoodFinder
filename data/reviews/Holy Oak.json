{"text":"Despite it's seemingly religious name, this Blansdowne cafe has nothing to do religion. It's a little cafe chock-full of character and a cool, homey-sorta vibe. You know the type of place I'm talking about: mismatched plates and cutlery on the tables, Value Village-esque paintings and pictures on the walls, slightly damaged panelling on the ceiling. It sorta looks like one day someone decided: 'Well, we have a stove. Why don't we open a restaurant?' It seems random, but truthfully, it doesn't matter all that much. If anything, those details make it better and much more comfortable.

There really isn't that much for food here. They've got a couple of items that are fairly easy for the lone person working to make when the place gets busy, which it definitely does. Mostly it's just the standard pressed sandwich kind of thing. No soup, no fries, no salad, as a side anyways. The friendly guy working there told me that it's not that kinda place. He said that it's mostly a cafe and a place to drink booze.

The menu is up on a chalkboard, and like I mentioned, it mostly has pressed sandwiches, like grilled cheese with apples and Tandoori chicken stuffed Naan bread. The sandwiches certainly aren't bad, but sadly, the majority of the stuff they make seems to have been brought in with little of it made in-house, like the Naan bread. The Naan was the kinda stuff pressed and packaged somewhere distant, and then bought at some grocery retail giant. It definitely would have been better if they worked with someone local to get some truly authentic stuff. They do have quite a few baked goods too. I'm not sure if those were made in-house or not, but they look nice next to a cup of the great coffee they serve.

I've seen some pictures of brunch items at Holy Oak, like eggs Benny, but based on when I was there I couldn't see that happening. Maybe they do bring someone in on the weekends to cook, but they guy working never mentioned it to me when I asked him about the food or the limited menu.

I went during the week for lunch, and this little place was pretty packed. Mostly with twenty and thirty somethings in front of laptops. It seems like a pretty cool place to work for those of us that frequent coffee shops for that sorta thing, because there really isn't much else in the neighborhood that offers it. It's cozy and comfortable, and I could easily see myself sitting there with a coffee, comfortably typing away.

Holy Cafe is a neat place, but it certainly doesn't warrant a big trip to get to it. If you happen to be in the neighborhood and you're looking for a comfortable place to soak up WiFi and get a decent cup of coffee, Holy Oak can definitely provide. But it doesn't offer much more than that."}
{"text":"My favourite place to come for an afternoon pint (or 2), a snack, and a really delicious coffee.  Very laid back atmosphere and free wifi.  The staff are really friendly too.   It's a cozy little space so it sometimes fills up on weekends, but never gets too crazy.  They seem to always have St. Ambroise on tap, but they have a fair number of beers available by the bottle, too."}
{"text":"I have only been here once for brunch. My favourite brunch place is the Swan and that is how I measure other brunches.

My Mum makes the best scrambled eggs EVER and she sets the standard there. The only ones that compare are served at Frank (the AGO) and cost $16! 

The Holy Oak is Swaneriffic and the eggs are Mumtastic. The food is a proper mix of honouring the traditional and adding signature twists that make this place special. The potatoes are flavoured with lemon and mint(?) - sounds weird but is very nice. And the scrambled eggs are PERFECT.

My companion had a version of eggs benedict served on grilled halloumi and she liked it so much she returned the next week.

Good coffee is essential to the brunch experience and some of the very best coffee in Toronto is served here.

The only quibble I have is beet salad comes with almost everything and I am not a fan of beets."}
{"text":"Holy Oak is down the street from a sewing place where I've been taking lessons and it's the closest place to get coffee, so I've been a few times.  Very hipster, the kind of hipster where the owners don't think an overhead sign is necessary, instead there is a little small one on a sandwich board out front.  The servers are pleasant in a cautious sort of way, as though they know I'm not a regular and don't want to get too close.  No drip coffee, but the latte was decent and they have tasty ginger molasses cookies."}
{"text":"This place is great, great drinks, super atmosphere, open early for coffee, open late for drinks and music. I've seen so many good shows here in this tiny little venue I'm so appreciated that it's in my neighbourhood.
I can't think of another venue in general where you can see experimental electronic music, folk, country, rock, hip hop,poetry readings etc etc... 
Great place"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area I make the time to stop in Holy Oak.  Its a great find with lovely vintage diningroom tables and lots of kitchy decor details.  They sandwiches are awesome - everyone should try the aged cheddar/apple/basil one at least once.  

The staff are always helpful and nice and the homey feel is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This little rectangle of a joint does a great job of transforming from a sun-drenched cafe during the day--that's replete with laptop-toting hipsters--in to a moody, candlelit bar come night fall. (Post 9 pm they ask that creative professionals close their laptops, so as to not distract from the vibe.)

Great selection of cocktails for under $9. Pert Vert is probably my favourite. Their food is also pretty tasty. The soups are always scrumptious and I adore their tandoori chicken-stuffed nan. They also pull one mean espresso shot--always have had nice creamy, cremas."}
{"text":"This place is like the old Kensington Market. Hippy-ish, authentic and sincere. And fun. the staff have an edge...there seems to be lots of diversity in the music that's played - both live and canned. The coffee is delicious, so is the creamy beer on tap. I forget the brand but the cream stuff is good and I'm not a beer lover at all. Some of the tables have plugs for computers - their internet works. This place is an oasis in a neighborhood that is crying out for more. The prices are reasonable and there is a vibe of openness and welcoming. Cafe (salon) culture comes to Bloor and Landsdowne, finally..."}
{"text":"Tasty coffee, amazing vibe and setup. Only ever been during the day. Very kid friendly (there's a basket of toddler toys) and superb taste in recorded and live music. Food is tolerable. Great staff. Should go down as one of the businesses that helped revive/grow Bloordale."}
{"text":"Great place! fantastic atmosphere, it was even better listing to a live band play! Not a bad selection of beer on tap and for pretty cheap too! Next time i'm in the area i will be going back."}
{"text":"the Toronto Lover system:

This is a very nice cafe in a very cool area. You're sitting in here read a book, write a book, chat with a hipster friend of yours, or to have a decent breakfast. The Holy Oak Cafe does almost everything you want it to; however, the breakfasts are a little overpriced (they can be over $10 for meals that really should be under) and the room is a little small, so you might have to move chairs around to figure out a comfortable seating arrangement.

3 stars"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and it was for a very special event. A friend of mine was launching a book of photos he had taken of some of the many lost and forgotten rivers under Toronto.

The staff were all very friendly, and the drinks were reasonably priced. After having a terrible dining experience just minutes earlier, I was very relieved to see that they offered a quinoa salad, and banana coconut muffins. The salad was fantastic, it was just the right balance of everything, and the lemon tang was not too overpowering. The portion size was much bigger than I expected, and still reasonably priced. My boyfriend had the muffin and he said that although it wasn't as tasty as the ones I bake, it was second best. 

Although the food menu is limited, I think it was very suitable in hosting the book launch. It became quite packed, but atmosphere always remained relaxed and welcoming. The only disappointment was the beer selection, which wasn't that great, but still passable."}
{"text":"My business partner and I ended up at the Holy Oak on a Tuesday after realizing that almost every other coffee shop in Blansdowne closes around 4-5pm on weekdays (which is a bit ridiculous).  We were happy to find Holy Oak open and with a couple available tables where we could get some work done.  We ordered coffee, which was great, and the atmosphere was really nice and cozy, but the door was kept open and there was a steady stream of people (including the barista, I believe) smoking on a bench directly outside the door so the whole place reeked of cigarette smoke.  I really wanted to like this place, I really liked their coffee and their prices were decent, but that just ruined it for me and we ended up leaving quickly and going to a tea shop across the street.  

Bottom line, good coffee and good atmosphere, but if you are someone who cares about their right to decide whether or not to smoke, this unfortunately is not the place for you (until they clue in and decide to either close their door or remove their conveniently placed bench outside the window)."}
{"text":"What a lovely and quirky place this is. It's warm and inviting and very casual. One of my faves in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The last time I was there the place was FULL of flies. And whenever I've been there, the barista's do not appear to have a systematic way of taking orders and money. It's this kinda, whoever-pounces-first cluster around the bar. 
And So Dark! for a cafe. It's not for me."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Toronto. (They time each espresso run and ensure that each coffee has three tones in the crema!) The spanakopita is amazing and is usually so fresh it's often warm.

The staff is friendly, openminded, extremely intelligent and knowledgeable. The music is great and varied, and the ambience is cozy. 

I love that I not only leave with a delicious Americano that doesn't leave me feeling over caffeinated, I also learn about art, culture, literature, and music each time I visit."}
{"text":"Great casual place for breakfast/bruch....didn't know about the free WIFI...even better!

Great food, went on a weekend and did not have to wait in any lineup.  

Def recommend Holy Oak."}
{"text":"I entered Holy Oak to escape the cold, without intention of necessarily making a purchase. The friend that I was with intended to buy an Americano and an empanada, which I paid for because he could not get the ATM to work. Cash only establishment. The first thing I noticed, and kept noticing for whatever reason, was the chalkboard sign that read 'NO LAPTOPS AFTER 9PM.' The chalk sign may have read differently, said 'PLEASE' maybe, but those are the words i remember. The barista looked very familiar to me. I think he reminded me of someone, or maybe several people, from back home. He was kind, pleasant, seemed to enjoy his job, and exuded a managerial presence. I wish I could remember which band t-shirt he was wearing. He made many trips to and from the basement packing away a new shipment of beer while I was in the restroom, which I stayed in longer than I normally would have because I was concerned that the toilet was perhaps not functioning correctly. 

It can be interesting the subtext that might reveal itself about an establishment with the discovery of the wifi password."}
{"text":"Holy Oak is one of my favourite daytime hangs, as well as one of my favourite evening destinations -- they cover pretty much all of my needs!

Daytime: There is no cozier cafe than Holy Oak. The friendliest, sweetest staff. Delicious espresso. A variety of sweet and savoury treats (I developed a spanikopita addiction throughout my frequent visits). House-made soup, several kinds of grilled cheese sandwiches (one with apple and basil - yum!). Very reasonable prices. No pretension or bullshit.

Nighttime: An intimate, candle-lit music venue and bar, featuring some of the best musical acts in Toronto. A good selection of beers on tap (usually a couple of St Ambroise, Beau's, Cheval Blanc, and more). Great cocktails. Not feeling like alcohol? There is also juice, tea, hot chocolate, etc.

Happy fifth birthday, Holy Oak! Bloordale wouldn't be the same without you."}
{"text":"I love the Holy Oak. I love that it's a bit weird and shabby but the Americanos are perfect, the baristas are lovely, and it's cozy as hell. 

I need background noise to work so the music and chatter of the customers means I spend some pretty productive days here pounding coffee until my heart can no longer tolerate it."}
{"text":"Excellent value, warm service, like being at grandma's house.

Try the croissants and americanos!"}
{"text":"Great place to read a book over a cup of coffee or get some studying done. They're also licensed and have some food options. And there's a bunch of board games downstairs if you need something to do."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, nice ambiance, great service and free wifi.  I love it.

The atmosphere is very chill at the Holy Oak and I always feel totally welcome.  When I'm in Toronto, I generally stay nearby but even if I didn't, I would probably make the trek here because it is such a great place to set up and be productive for a few hours."}
{"text":"I'm an east-ender, but nice to see such a fine coffee shop in the west end. I figured out it was a west-end place pretty quick because I was the only person there without a computer on my tabletop. 
Anyway, nice to see that people who get cabin fever at home or who have small and busy apartments have a nice place to do some thinking and writing. It's one of the important contributions of coffee shops-- they allow people to live densely because they already have an office close to home. We need to find some way to support that role of coffee shops.
I and two friends dropped in yesterday afternoon after a day-long meeting, intending to have a coffee, but instead ordered cider and beer.
It's nice to see a little mix, as long as the liquor license doesn't exclude young people from coming in.  It's a clever way to let a coffee house have a life after dark, when most people don't want to drink a lot of coffee.
Given that the light meals seem to feature local and sustainable, it would have been nice to have a few more local craft beers presented."}
{"text":"Drip coffee please! Your espresso-based bevs are delicious, but $4 for a latte is not always something I can swing. That said, I welcome Intelligentsia's entry to Toronto, and this is a cute cafe in an area that could use a few more cute places."}
{"text":"Holy Oak Cafe might not seem like much as you peer in from the outside but I assure you it's what's inside that counts! It's kinda an ad hoc cafe, where the bulk of the start up money went into what was important: coffee and snacks. The remaining funds were used to install an eclectic mix of old, second hand tables and chairs to accommodate the clientele. As you stand in the place the impression you'll get of Holy Oak is that it's essentially a new soul in an old body. For what tends to be an otherwise dreary section of town Holy Oak Cafe is a welcome addition.

The coffee is purely espresso based here and the shots are competently pulled getting a nice reddish brown crema. The coffee in question is none other than Intelligentsia's Black Cat Espresso. This particular espresso in flavor is exactly as the roaster describes: Notes of cherry, syrupy, molasses. It's an interesting espresso blend that differentiates itself from other espresso I've had round the city. Yummy.

Aside from the espresso I enjoyed I also had one of their croissants and it was easily one of the best croissants I've had in the city. In fact I'm tempted to wonder if they were hauled in from Bonjour Brioche cross city. So definitely have a croissant with your coffee if they still have some available. On the downside their muffins are pricey for the tiny morsels they are, but they did look appetizing.

Staff was friendly and attentive and importantly the lady knew what she was doing on the espresso machine. Prices are reasonable. I'm a fan. Makes a nice stopover on your way to or from Value Village."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm on a cafe binge recently to find the best ones to work in. Holy Oak is definitely a contender for a top notch spot.  Cute little mixed matched chairs and a warm welcoming atmosphere makes this Bloor west cafe one of my new favourites. Really friendly staff and really great coffee too. It seemed to be the place for people without offices to meet up and talk business because everyone around me was in a meeting or in an interview. 

Also another spot that turns into a bar past 9pm. Will definitely need to check this place out for beers one day. Also whatever they were cooking while I was there smelt way too good. I can't believe I didn't order any food! Oh well next time!"}
{"text":"This update is for the cappuccino served at this place.
As part of the indie passport I came here for my Cappuccino fix.
The serving is small and they don't have any sweetener as well (on the plus side they use organic milk which done right can balance the drink) 
The Latte art was nothing special  and the espresso had not much taste either and was way too mellow.
The place was busy with a younger crowd. 
2 Star for the Cappuccino."}
{"text":"Decent  bar and coffeehouse. Nice ambiance friendly staff and decent local beers on tap (if my memory serves). A little dark to read ( I was killing time last time I got here) but nice vibe from the place. 

Can't comment on the food as I've just had the beer here."}
{"text":"Came here to meet up with someone and just ordered some juice to drink (just under $4 seems like a lot for a cup of juice!). Be warned, $4.50 (or something like that) minimum to be able to pay with debit. 

Cute little space, decent amount of seating (not comfortable). My friend tried to order a grilled cheese and they were out or something (this was at 2pm, odd that they wouldn't have a basic item in stock around what's still considered lunch rush). 

Not a place to sit for any period of time, not exactly sure I would come back. Left much to be desired."}
{"text":"What a quaint little cafe... and yes, the Indie Passport is the one reason that brought me here as Lansdowne and Bloor is one of intersections of the city I generally tend to skip altogether. 

Don't get me wrong, there is the odd and quaint dive bar nearby, the interesting restaurants that seems to be starting to spring up here and there and... Who can forget that strip joint adjacent to the church just west of Lansdowne? That setup is golded and definitely a one stop shop for the local sin-ridden-strip-joint-lover. However it is hard to fight the slightly soul sucking vibe you get when hanging around this hood for too long, SPECIALLY at night. 

No, I am not being snobbish, in fact, this used to be my hood for a few months back in '03 and I knew the hood well and let just say, gentrification has ways to go.

Anyway, this cafe is trying to go all out, and transcend being just a mere cafe. Oh yes, they are going for the \"artistic venue\" approach normally found in larger locales like the Tranzac, Victory Cafe and to a lesser extend The Central. 

As a word of warning, The Oak's website is a bit half-cooked but you can see they are keeping themselves busy with ongoing live music, dj fueled nights and even a live dating game show? For real?

However this 'dive cafe' is just one room in size and cannot compete when it comes to sheer space to other venues and as such they try to make due with what they go. So, don't be surprised if you are having a latte at 8:45pm and all of the sudden the staff beings taking adjacent tables to the back to make room. 

Also they are LCBO licensed, and before I left they were setting up a DJ as it seems they stay open past at least midnight and wait for the ringing techno music to lure willing dancers to chill the night away. 

Now, the place is very low key, with rickety looking tables and chairs. Heck, my chair felt as it might actually break on me, so expect for everything to have that retro, Queen Street West cheap look with some random painting/photos hanging from the wall. 

Sadly, my latte was really 'meh,' and although the staff seemed more than friendly, I would more likely recommend this locale as a place to hang out with a beer than  with a coffee. 

I do applaud them for trying to be a far more diverse venue than just a cafe, like El Cafecito, located just east of here and in fact, I  might check them out again if there something in their calendar which sparks my interest. But fix your website though."}
{"text":"We came here late on a Friday night to grab some drinks. This is a nice spot. There was one bartender working and they had a good variety of beers and cocktails and service was friendly. I had a couple of very tasty old fashioneds. We also had a great view of people walking around outside.

The atmosphere was comfortable and relaxed, and tables were spaced far apart for it to feel pretty intimate. 

We will likely come back."}
{"text":"Came here early morning to kill some time and do work before my appointment at 10am. I was an early bird at 8am, and although lots of coffee shops in Bloordale, only this was one was open this early. 

Lots of tables, and wifi to use. It was a little dark, and seemed way more suited to be a bar than a working coffee shop. 

I got a latte, and proceeded to do work. My only complaint was the loud loud music and choice of tunes. I was okay with the reggae, but it was so loud that I couldn't hear myself. But then it switched to a slow electronic dubstep (I don't know what it's called), which started to give me a headache, I asked it to be turned down just a little. 
It wasn't really the atmosphere that I could spend a long time in, especially in the morning."}
{"text":"Great environment. Had a Mocha. Tastes amazing. Service is good too!"}
{"text":"Best americanos and lattes in the city. There, I said it. Or at any rate, the best espresso-based drinks I've ever had. 

You walk into this quaint, small space, and yet somehow, they've managed to lay it out perfectly, so that even if you're in a smaller, two-seater table against the wall, you feel as if you have space to move, and gather your belongings safely about you. The last thing I want is to go write at a coffee shop, try to enjoy my coffee, and feel as if I'm having a conversation with the two people who are sitting next to me, at a separate table, and Holy Oak has managed to space everything out so that this doesn't happen.

As night falls, the staff turns down the over-head lights little by little, and place candles on the tables, and very discreetly, might I add, so as not to interrupt whatever you're doing. Sitting in that little cafe, with the candles twinkling all around, good music pouring out of the speakers at the most appropriate level, makes you feel cozy, but more importantly for me, it provides me with an extremely relaxing and comfortable environment to work within, enabling me to get more done. And when I'm trying to get writing accomplished, that's the most important thing for me that a coffee shop provide. That, and a damn good coffee. (Or even a beer, of which they've got an excellent selection). 

Definitely worth the travel-time, if you don't live in this area!"}
{"text":"So many reviews already, I feel like a pebble in the pond!

Consequently, let's make it snappy!

*  EXCELLENT $2 Americanos.  Yum!
*  Delicious sandwiches on artisan bread.  Apple and Chedder... Yum!
*  Wicked good quinoa salad.  Yum!  (Pattern?)
*  Super relaxed, but not overbearingly hipster, atmosphere.  Yum!  (er... ahem)
*  Boardgame nights on Wednesdays.  Though I've still yet to make it to one.  It's gotta be good, right?  It's a groovy cafe with boardgames.  I even saw a copy of Pandemic.  Huzzah!

So, Holy Oak?  Holy HELL YEAH!

(Note:  Outdoor seating is a bench.  Still, I think that counts.  I hope so, I like the bench, and I had an Americano sitting upon it.)"}
{"text":"What a gem! Holy Oak does it all and does it well! Great drinks (try the Pear and Bourbon, it had a good name, but I can't remember it now), casual cafe vibe, a coffee-shop by day, bar by night, with food!

They even have live music! I will have to return for the live music, because this place is small so you would get up close with the performers.

Recommend."}
{"text":"Went here this morning after reading all the breakfast/brunch reviews. Only to discover... they no longer serve brunch! The server was very apologetic and said she'd asked the boss to update their website. They have coffee and a few baked goods, but no eggs, and worse luck, NO BACON. 

So, neutral review, because it's not really their fault, but wanted to let Yelp know."}
{"text":"I've been to Holy Oak a few times now. It opened up recently in the Blansdowne neighbourhood, down the road from the sort-of-sketchy Coffee Time. To say it's a welcome addition to the area would be an understatement. Americano's are $2, and they are all kinds of good. I haven't tried any of their pastries yet, though they look quite tasty. They also sell sandwiches. I had one of their grilled cheese sandwiches, which was enjoyable. The place is filled with some eclectic furniture and a piano. It's very spartan. I quite like the way it looks. This is definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"Holy Smokes, Holy Oak!

This coffee shop cum bar transitions during the course of the day from a cozy place to study to an awesome spot for cocktails in the evening.   One of the awesome trendy spots that is transforming Bloordale to the next hip spot.

The shop is definitely casual (think normcore fashion in a restaurant).  I still wouldn't call it a dive bar though.  The dimly lit bar in the evening has a really intimate vibe to it with a just appropriate enough amount of background noise to make it feel quite pleasant.  It's homey and trendy at the same time.

The COCKTAIL list here is really pretty interesting.  I enjoyed two cocktails last time:
1) A cynar sour.  For those of you who don't know, cynar is a liquor made from artichokes.  It's a bracing taste, but actually shockingly pleasant as a sour. They also had a few other cocktails with cynar in them.  It takes some talent to employ this potent potable.

2) The Last Word.  I ordered this drink off-menu after spying bottles of both green chartreuse and maraschino liquor on the shelf.  These libations are often absent from many pretty solid bars. The super-friendly bartender was thrilled to give a new cocktail a try and gladly followed my directions for a general success. 

I only ended up here because 3Speed has been slammed every time I tried to go there.  Holy Oak is a great little serendipitous discovery for me.  Perfect for a cocktail before or after your outing to The Emerson.

FYI, no laptops after 9 PM...that's the official time for the coffee shop to bar transition."}
{"text":"Nice little place out of the way, has a very earthy feel and lots of trendy artistic folk and students, had a good date there and had never been before. Prices were good,  a pot of tea is 3 bucks!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite neighbourhood hangout. 

I've had many an okcupid date here (if the staff has been paying any attention they probably think I'm a bit of a floozy) because of the laid back vibe and drink options varying from great coffee and tea to stiff drinks. 

I haven't tried the food but it looks and smells delicious. The service is always friendly and speedy. 

A great place to relax or catch one if many fantastic shows at night."}
{"text":"Hard to believe I'm only trying out this place now. Where have I been all this time? Really! Coffee is just amazing! These guys will be the new Starbucks in no time."}
{"text":"whole wheat bread + aged cheddar + basil + sliced apple + chillax atmosphere = mmmmm"}
{"text":"Another hipster bar.

The furniture here is even more ghetto than the average hipster bar. Some of the tables looked like they had been salvaged from a garbage disposal site or from the \"free\" pile of a garage sale. Yikes.

Very friendly bartender and good selection of both coffee type drinks and boozy beverages.

It was so fecking hot in this place. I honestly don't think I can return until at least the end of September. They need to get some A/C, or if they are too hipster for that, at least get a couple fans please. I suppose the lack of air was meant to add to the whole \"grandmother's living room\" theme."}
{"text":"maybe the best establishment in toronto, except for the fact that 99% of their playlist is Dr. John."}
{"text":"Ordered a latte. Server was friendly. Simple olive walls, mismatched furniture, and eclectic playlist. At 430 in the afternoon, quiet and relaxed atmosphere. Low murmur of several conversations and a family with a moderately quiet infant. Good place to get some light work done. Latte was average... Beer list looks good. Solid 3... Would need come back at night to see if it could be a 4."}
{"text":"Indie Passport brought me here again to Holy Oak Cafe. This time cappuccino was on my mine instead of beer.... 

It was quite busy on a Wednesday afternoon full with locals chilling. The atmosphere was really relaxing as most of the patrons were either reading or on their laptop. 

Cappuccino was average. I would just ordering a beer next time............ and my Yelp friend can just keep drinking his coffee!"}
{"text":"Great supporters of local live music!! Beer, coffee and good sound. Bring cash because they don't use debit."}
{"text":"Cute cafe cum bar in Bloordale! Decent (if small) drink and food menu, but definitely the place I'd want to work remotely. Bar service only, but that's ok. Good tea selection and they offer some music events some nights."}
{"text":"Yep, welcome outpost in an underserved area.  Great place to grab a coffee (at a nice price too!) and relax, as predicted by previous reviews.  They have baked goods, sandwiches and beer!  Also, they have free wi-fi.  Tip:  Take the Emerson street exit from the subway.

I have occasion to be in the area on a weekly basis and will now look forward to it!"}
{"text":"You've heard of dive bars? This is is a dive cafe. Just about everything at the Holy Oak has a rustic and mismatched air about it -- and the faintest hint of grime. When I walked up to the bar tucked at the back of this diminutive shop, I almost wanted to order a round of PBRs, but it was Sunday morning and I thought better of it.

It's located steps from Lansdowne subway station which makes it a highly convenient meeting point for Bloordale Villagers. They make a solid espresso here (Intelligensia) and also offer tea, hot chocolate, and baked goods. It was a rock solid place to spend a few hours with my laptop plunking out reviews. The vibe is quiet enough to chill out without feeling that you are in a library or mausoleum. There is free wifi, but outlets are far and few between.

If the HOC has a failing it's the filthy washrooms (which included a note on the urinal imploring me to turn a knob as I \"wizzed\" (sic) to prevent stink) but my feelings were quickly ameliorated when I spotted a mirror outside the loo emblazoned with the Def Leppard logo. So I guess I don't mind so much. This entire paragraph was useless. I apologise.

On my last visit the staff was painstakingly applying gold leaf to the acoustic tiles on the ceiling; I wonder if they're done yet?

Obligatory Title Pun: Holy Oak Cafe Batman!

Menu Readability: I can't remember, but if I had to guess... chalkboard?

Need to mention: They really do sell beer and other boozies.

What this place teaches me about myself: I might need to rethink my Sunday morning teetotaling ways."}
{"text":"I've been to the Holy Oak a handful of times now, that in itself means I'm impressed. Friendly, quality, affordable cafes frequented by the sane(er) members of the neighbourhood are a commodity for me, and the competition is getting thicker.

Great brunch on the weekends -if not for its limited hours- delicious americano's all week, good tunes (not radio) and lots of tables (and plugs), make Holy Oak a go-to spot.

Holy Oak also has live music often and board game nights/special events on the various weeknights. That, combined with bonus points for being a few doors down from Vintage 69 Collective, where I found sweet pair of winter boots for 45 bucks the other week, puts it in the ranks of Three Speed and Saving Gigi for places I like to read/eat/listen/drink in the neighbourhood."}
