{"text":"This place is very disappointed.   The staffs in the front are Not friendly.   And now they nickle and dime you.  I ordered a half dozen bagel and they charged you extra to have your bagel cut in half.  I almost walked out and I should have."}
{"text":"Stopped here quick embarking on the next leg of our roadtrip.   Service was a little slow, but it wasn't unreasonable.   This place is owned by New Yorkers, so you know that they know bagels. The bacon egg and cheese was pretty good. Also the coffee was great. If you ask for sugar and cream, they make it in a way that is phenomenal."}
{"text":"The Good - These are genuine NY bagels and Boars Head meats.  It reminds me of the bagel stores in NY back when I was a kid.  The service is friendly, you see the same faces every time you go, and you hear them call regular customers by name.  The sandwiches are NY sized as well.  A grown man will be full, even if he's able to finish it.  They also have real NY deli rolls that remind me of what my mom would bring home from the bakery on Sundays.  The Bad - The place reminds me of bagel stores I used to visit as a kid.  Great food, but dirty and nasty and not kept up with.  I know they get really busy but that's no excuse for the way the meat slicer looks a lot of the time.  The formica used to house their bagel bins is chipped and pealed back and really needs to be redone.  The ceiling tiles and vent fan back by the cash register are just plain nasty and look like they've never been cleaned.  Considering the place consistently has a line you would think they'd just have a cleaning crew come in once or twice a week to clean the entire place.  The drop down ceiling tiles are easy and cheap to change if they can't be cleaned.  The Depending on your Point of View - I have an issue with pickles, I simply detest them.  When they make you a sandwich they are nice enough to give you a slice of a NY deli pickle.  The problem, they pack it in with your sandwich.  If you don't like pickles, half your sandwich is ruined with pickle juice.  Hence my headline \"Pickles are NOT a garnish!\"   The bottom line is if you want good NY bagels there is no where else I've found in Charlotte to go.  You'll wait in line and be happy about it.  You'll see the dirty tiles as you're paying and won't care.  Well that is, until someone else moves down and decides to open a newer, cleaner bagel shop.  Don't think it'll happen?  Look at the number of pizza places that have opened in the last 3-4 years and think again."}
{"text":"If you havnt been here you are missing out! After we moved from NJ it was hard to find a good bagel place. We tried everything and Bagel Bin tops it all, even bagel places in New Jersey! I love this place and the charismatic employees who make the best bagel sandwiches EVER!"}
{"text":"I've been a Bagel Bin customer for many years, and the food is consistently excellent. The staff remembers my name, asks about my family, and are very pleasant considering the customer crush some mornings. Bagel Bin is a top quality food experience, though you may have to wait in line during busy times. Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"yes another NYer commenting about bagels! I was impressed with these bagels - chewy outside and soft inside.  Not bready bagels which I hate. Even in NY I hated those bready ones. and the everything bagel had a good amount of everything on it! I will drive the 20min to get these bagels. The people working there were very nice too. They froze and defrosted well so I can stock up so I don't have to make a 40min trek on a weekend morning! Side note - NY styles are all different just like are pizza! But a good bagel is a good bagel whether its the twisted style (my total favorite and hard to find anywhere) or traditional. And adding good service like at the bagel bin it means it a place to return to!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area about 3 months ago and this has become a new favorite spot! There is always a line, but it is always worth it! You can get just about anything on the hawaiian bagel and you'll never go wrong! I love chicken salad and McAlister's is probably my all-time favorite, but this place gives McAlister's a run for their money! I've never had any bad customer service experiences here like some reviews have stated. The girls behind the counter (though probably tired and hot working in close range to hot ovens in this awful NC heat) have always been very nice and try to give speedy and accurate service! As far as prices go, my boyfriend and I usually go in and get 2 sandwiches and 2 sweet teas for around $20!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 103, and I was informed they closed at 1 and would not serve me even though there was plenty of other guests in line and still eating inside. Not a good way to treat a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst restaurant the ever serve Bagels in my life. I waited for 10 minutes while the girls talk to each other and didn't even move an inch in the line therefore I had no breakfast only go if you have plenty of time and you don't mind the people being nasty the people meaning the employees"}
{"text":"Incredible sandwiches!  If you think you can find a better bagel or sandwich I would definitely like to know where?  They pile sandwiches with a ton of meet and only the best boars head..."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever! Busy time (11:45 am Saturday) but the speed was atrocious. 30 minutes to serve about 15 people in line. How hard can bagels and sandwiches take? They should either take a course in Service Operations or watch other bagel shops in action (Einstein's, Poppy's, Brooklyn Bagel in Arlington, VA).   I just wanted a half dozen bagels to go and asked politely if I could just go to the cashier. Nope - you have to wait in the agonizing line.  The bagels are average. Nothing special but fine for Charlotte. Certainly not worth 30 minutes. Having Boar's Head and lots of other sandwich options is nice but it just adds so much assembly time. Make it simple and give people less choice so they don't have to wait in line forever for a bagel and cream cheese.  Won't go back. Poppy's is better anyway, as is Noah's Bagel & Deli."}
{"text":"Awesome home made bagels!  Great varieties of bagels and meats. Small and quaint, similar to what I remember from childhood in NJ."}
{"text":"I love the bagels but the staff is very unpleasant and unwelcoming. Seems to be a negative working atmosphere too. Not a single person seems to like their job or the people they are working with. I've been in quite a few times and have never gotten a hello or have a great day."}
{"text":"While the bagels are decent, they are unfortunately over shadowed by the sub-par service from some very rude girls.  While waiting the guaranteed 25-30 minutes, you can expect unwelcome stories/drama about how one girl almost f$$ked another up, or at the very least, foul language, eye rolls and less than mediocre customer service. If you are patient enough to make it to the point where one can order, you are immediately rewarded with a short and indifferent check out.   You will see people waltz to the front, pay and leave after 2 minutes.  Wonder what that takes???    After taking my family here over the last 4 months, and being nice despite the terrible treatment,  we have decided to spend our money elsewhere.  Foul attitudes make for a foul experience... And the worst part is, these employees could care less.  By far the worst customer service I've experienced in Charlotte so far."}
{"text":"They would have 5 stars if they got a flat top grill and didn't microwave everything.  I am old school cream cheese on a non toasted bagel so it doesn't really effect me.  Need a dozen bagels to go?  Best bagels in town."}
{"text":"I visit here a lot, they make FRESH boiled bagels. I have tried all sorts of their products such as muffins, cinnamon rolls, deli meat and sandwiches. NO complaints. I just hate that the line is always very long and they're very understaffed a lot of the time. GET THERE EARLY!"}
{"text":"If you want to travel to NYC for some authentic \"deli,\" this is your place! Try the chicken salad on an everything bagel. Delish! Hubby had the Italian on ciabatta and loved it. The bagels are so fresh and delicious! Anything you choose will be great! This is our new fav lunch place and I can't wait to go for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite sandwich place, but employees are now slow and seem content working at their own pace. They used to work with a sense of urgency, now you get in line and you can expect at least a half hour wait until you get your food! Not sure why they slowed down, but customers don't want to wait 35 minutes to get a sandwich (yes we timed it on a saturday at noon). Owners need to shake up the current staff, or get some fresh faces in there working at a quicker pace!"}
{"text":"Everything is always fabulous when you come to the  bagel bin!! The girls are awesome, and that chicken salad is the best!!"}
{"text":"Not for anyone in a hurry! The Bagel Bin is very popular and ALWAYS has a line so save it for a lazy Saturday morning. The bagels are great and very fresh with a great deal of choices. They have fresh lox and other types of meat if you want a little protein with your bagel. The only thing I do not like about The Bagel Bin is their coffee: its disgusting. I have to have my coffee in the morning so I would suggest hitting up the Starbucks and then going to get your bagel. Great place for the bagel lover!"}
{"text":"Great bagel shop with a New York feel.  The amount of meat you get on a sandwich is incredible and the prices are very reasonable.  Very popular and often has a line."}
{"text":"The bagels are delicious but it will take you forever to get them. Employees have no sense of urgency and were talking and dance around as apposed to making orders.  There needs to be a better system of ordering and receiving the food because you should not have to wait over 30 minutes for bagels when the line is not even to the door."}
{"text":"Aside from the ridiculous wait times...service is great and so is food. Regular customer. They need to open another in mooresville to replace our dumpy bagel place!"}
{"text":"The one star is for their egg salad.  They lost all other stars because of their lack of customer service. Why do the workers have such bad attitude?! They are all angry & have  terrible attitude. When you walk in the negative energy slaps you in the face. God forbid you ask any of the workers a question, they will give you the dirtiest look and act as if you are inconveniencing them. In addition I could not believe that the girl who helped me had a very dirty shirt on.  Perhaps the business here is consistent enough for the owner but Mr. Owner if you train your staff on customer service and professionalism I guarantee your sales will go up. Very poorly run business. I will get my bagels where the workers aren't so miserable & unprofessional."}
{"text":"Bagels are decent, nothing spectacular. Cream cheese is kinda bland and too \"fluffy.\" Coffee was pretty good, but cups are cheap and flimsy. Cheap plastic cover took away from the taste.... had to pour it in a real cup when I got to work. Service was RUDE...not friendly at all. Any business that has workers that seem annoyed to be there doing their job loses my dollar every time. Not going back."}
{"text":"I just love this place!!   It's about 20 min out of the way for me, but worth it! It's run / owned by authentic New Yorkers and OMG do they have the best bagels. They all work as a team and get it done. Even if you see a line, which is very possible. It's totally worth it!!    My order: Egg bagel toasted open face with butter and Munster melted on top  My friend likes the Lox. If you don't want pickles, remember to ask for no pickles."}
{"text":"While the food here is ok, the wait to get a bagel on the weekends is just ridiculous. I have no idea why anyone would come here on the weekend. 30+ minutes in line for microwaved egg product on my bagel made me angry and want to throw the bagel back at someone. There is a lot of chatting always going on between regulars and the girls who make the food, which I think is one of the main factors that slows down the line. Also, the fact that you can't order ahead for pick ups on weekend mornings is just crazy.   But for the positives, if you go on a random Tuesday around 10:30 am to pick up your lunch for the day, get any of their bagel sandwiches (like roast beef or turkey) and you won't be disappointed. Plus, hardly any wait in line. Their fresh bagel sandwiches earned then 3 stars while the weekend ridiculousness took away 2 stars"}
{"text":"so today was my first stop at Bagel on the recommendation from a Fellow Northern that they had a good NY bagel. I was in the area for once during breakfast, so i stopped. First it was crowded the line was almost out the door which tells me this place is popular already got my happy because if its popular then its good. I looked over the menu quick and saw Fresh Lox on a bagel so that was my order. Because who doesn't love a bagel with lox and cream cheese and red onion and tomato. First review of the bagel we had a solid thick cream cheese layer with the required Cream cheese Plug. The Lox was fresh and so was the tomato and red onion. The bagel was crispy on the outside and chewy and wasnt too doughy. Pretty good bagel for not being in the tristate area prices were reasonable for sandwich like this. They get my vote so ill be heading there instead of whole foods for breaksfast on the weekends. That its better to support local especially if its good."}
{"text":"Wonderful little breakfast stop. Two dozen different varieties of bagels, as well as sandwiches and a few bakery treats. Fast friendly staff. This place opens up as early as 6am and there's always someone waiting to get in. I recommend trying the spinach, salt, or chocolate chip bagels."}
{"text":"Not bad bagels and cream cheese. But any sort of breakfast sandwhich is made with microwaved bacon and eggs. If you can get past that and the flies that cover that place go for it."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since they opened the doors. The bagels are excellent and they have a nice selection of Boars Head meats. The portions are generous and the service is usually quick, consistent and friendly."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I come in here whenever I am in town on military duty, I always make time for this place. It is like stepping into a real NYC bagel shop. Customer service is amazing and the food is delicious! Do not change a thing!"}
{"text":"Well this place is just delicious. I'd heard that it was the best bagel place in town, but I hadn't visited yet. Shame on me. I should visit every day, but also I should probably run a lot because otherwise daily bagel trips would make me chubby."}
{"text":"Great place, but the lines are just too long on weekends, the only time I can really go :-( Maybe the service line can be changed to improve?"}
{"text":"Reminds me of home. I'm a Long Island girl so I'm big on bagels. These are the most authentic NY style bagels I've found out here. Crisp on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. Sure the line can get a little long but its definitely worth it. I've never had bad service. I'm out there almost every weekend since I've found the place."}
{"text":"Bagels are good. Not NY good but for down in NC they are the best I've found. But here is my question. How come they don't have a separate line just for bagels on the weekends and in the mornings in general? It's totally ridiculous that someone coming in to grab a dozen bagels has to wait 30 min while they make egg sandwiches, etc for all these other customers. I would come in much more frequently if they just had a separate person running a bagel only line. They would sell 10 times the number of bagels and cream cheese. I hope someone from the restaurant reads this and takes the suggestion. You would make a lot more money and your customers would be a lot more satisfied. It's a simple solution to a very evident problem."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time & at 11:15 AM, there was a line! I figured this spot must be good!   Serving delicious Boar's Head meats, I knew I was in for a good sandwich. The menu is a plenty. I went with the blackened turkey with a plain bagel. I waited a bit long than I felt I should, but one of the employees thanked me for waiting. I was so hungry, that as soon as I got in my car, I had to eat! I was very surprised at how big the \"sandwich\" was! The lettuce, bacon & tomato all looked nice & the bagel, while a bit harder than my liking, it complemented the turkey & other toppings well. My total came to $7.54, for just the sandwich, which I felt like was a bit pricey, but again, Boar's Head meat isn't cheap. The sandwich was very filling & very tasty!  Place is very tiny, but there are places to sit. Parking is pretty ample, but there are busy businesses adjacent, so be prepared there."}
{"text":"Okay, so I was born in NY, transplanted to NC by my parents, moved back to NYC, and came back to NC.  So I know from delis.    And so do the folks at Bagel Bin.  They're from NY as well, so they know what they're doing.  Big, doughy, perfect bagels in every flavor and lots of cream cheeses.  I'm a plain/plain girl so I can't exactly comment on how good the flavors are, but the plain/plain is so good I always wish I had ordered 2.    But let's talk sandwiches.  If you're a fan of egg salad, you HAVE to try their egg salad on white.  I've attempted to recreate it and have only come close once, but unfortunately I wasn't in possession of fluffy, fresh texas toast to pile it on.  Whenever Bagel Bin is suggested for lunch, I've never turned it down.  There's just no way I am never not craving either a bagel or an egg salad.  So try it, for the love of god (and your tummy!)  Served with a perfect briny, garlicky pickle slice, chips, and authentic black & white cookies, and it's just like a taste of NYC way out here in a suburban strip mall in north carolina.    Took away the perfect 5th star because they don't ever have ginger ale, which isn't very NYC deli-ish of them!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Food is awesome and their all about business. Other customer complaints that their not overly nice is because they're busting their butts to focus on my food getting made so I can get to work. They always say good morning and ask for your order and get it out ASAP. I eat here at least 3 times a week and have never had a bad experience. Amazing sandwiches at a great price and no awkward small talk to worry about, just amazing food and the assurance you'll get the same consistent food when you come in again. Those ladies are awesome!! I'm on my way there now ;)"}
{"text":"Like other people have stated - great bagels for this area. I usually buy plain bagels and leave however I still have to wait at least 5 minutes and at most 25 minutes just for bagels. I think for $5 they should cook the food instead of microwaving eggs and bacon. The system in place to order and get the food is pretty poor. It says you can call in orders but when I tried they said its not allowed and then hung up. When I have ordered sandwiches, the staff messed up my order half the time and I'd rather not here about their personal lives in such great depth. The foul language is just unnecessary. They are great bagels though."}
{"text":"I've had bagels in New York from artisan bakeries and yet, this is still the best bagel that I have ever had!! This restaurant is an amazing local spot I grab an extremely reasonable and delicious bagel of any kind!! Their breakfast bagels are incredible and their lunch bagels are loaded with plenty of fresh sliced boars head meat. I love this place and have been coming here since I was a little boy. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in NC.  They are delicious and remind me of home (Jersey).   Cream cheese?  You'll get TONS of it on your bagel, so that it oozes out the sides, just like it should.  Try their homemade Veggie Cream Cheese.  Giant chunks of veggies on an everything bagel!  Yes, please. I've seen a few reviews about attitudes.  Don't like their attitudes?  Well don't ever go to Jersey then because the screaming across the shop makes me feel right. at. home."}
{"text":"So when you walk up to the counter there's sort of a Soup Nazi vibe. The staff isn't the friendliest. I ordered an Italian sandwich and it was meh. The table tops were filthy so all in all I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The Bagel Bin is a great place to grab a bagel or bagel sandwich or, if it's your thing, a coffee, on the go.  The sandwiches they pile on their bagels are huge and delicious, with fresh turkey and ham and whatever toppings you might want.  The most recent turkey bagel sammich I got from the Bagel Bin was so huge I would have had to unhinge my jaw to actually take a bite. I wound up deconstructing it slightly to get it down to normal-size.   It was still delicious though, and even though the service isn't the fastest, the end result is worth the wait in line."}
{"text":"There was a very long line which meant it was good. I go there a lot. The ladies that work there seem to enjoy their job. It is a small place. The bagels are very good. I would recommend all of them. When I looked at it, there was a perfect amount of butter and the water tasted very fresh. Overall I would recommend it to all."}
{"text":"The best bagel I've ever had.  I am from the south so I don't have experience with true NY bagels, but I could only think they are the same.  I get an egg bagel with turkey, lettuce, tomato, and scallion cream cheese.  It's a massive sandwich and beyond yummy!  The wait can look long, but the line moves so fast.  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"You can always count on their bagels to be fresh and delicious. I check in from time to time and the food is always consistently good. I usually get a bagel with either butter or cream cheese if I'm planning on working out later in the day.  I've never tried the Italian sandwich for lunch but I heard it's crazy good. I like the deli atmosphere and the regulars that frequent the bagel bin as well as the people behind the counter, they are really friendly and the other main reason customers keep coming back. If this is your first time here be prepared to be called baby or sweetie, a little southern charm to a New York business"}
{"text":"Considering the fact that there are so many positive reviews of the place, I will keep my review sweet and simple.   Moving to the Lake Norman area about 10+ years ago, my family needed a bagel shop close by. We're big fans of Einstein Bagels, but the closest one is in Charlotte and we aren't going to drive down there every other day. So, we wanted something local. And the Bagel Bin does just that.  The girls up front are always looking to help you in a timely fashion with whatever kind of order you have. We usually only get bagels and nothing like the sandwiches or Boars Head meats. I've found that the consistency of the bagels is off-and-on, but as of late, the bagels (everything bagels) have been consistent in both size and seasoning. Bagels are doughy and perfectly sized and definitely genuine NY bagels as far as I know. Prices are $0.89 a bagel and their baker dozen deals are the best around town. I'd skip getting cream cheese and stick with store bought cream cheese (cheaper and tastier).   Expect a long wait on the weekends and morning rush. I definitely recommend this local and small business bagel shop!   *Bring cash- much easier and faster for the front cashier."}
{"text":"I have only been here once to get a dozen bagels but I only had to go once to know that these bagels are yummy as well as their homemade cream cheeses.  I got lox and raisin walnut the day I went it but they have a good variety of cream cheese to choose from.  I will definitely be back to try more bagels, as well as their bagel sandwiches."}
{"text":"The bagels are good but the lady at the cash register is so condescending and rude. I watched her belittle a mentally handicapped person. Who does that? Anyway, I won't support this business anymore."}
{"text":"Decent spot to grab a bagel to-go or dine-in, if you so choose. It's tucked away in the Northcross shopping center and is bustling with a lively crew of workers. I visited early(ish) on a Saturday morning around 9:00 and the ladies behind the counter were wide awake! Lots of chatter and interaction with the customers in line which seemed to consist heavily of regulars.  Their selection that morning included plain, honey wheat, blueberry, everything, salt, from what I can remember. While I waited in line (which wasn't that long), I saw employees bringing out fresh, new bins of bagels. I placed my order for a bacon & egg on an everything bagel. I noticed that they pop their eggs in the microwave (I'm not the biggest fan of that) so don't come here expecting otherwise.  My total for the sandwich and a plain bagel (just sliced) came to just under $5 which is a pretty good deal. However, I found my bagel sandwich to be dry. It was hot but the texture of the bagel was less than chewy. Even though I already have a personal favorite when it comes to bagel shops (Poppy's!), I still like to support other local shops whenever I get the chance. I can't see myself becoming a Bagel Bin regular but I won't be deterred from stopping in if I happen to be in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"If the rating was based on food alone it would be five stars. The reason it's two stars is because of the poor service. The employees often talk about personal business and neglect waiting customers... you will also get a dose of bad attitude often as well. my last experience was so bad, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Italian on ciabatta. No italian dressing. Add onion and spicy mustard. Boom. Best sandwich in the area. Add a brownie and a pickle and you're set."}
{"text":"Great bagel place, priced well, staff is hardworking and handles hundreds if not thousands of customers daily in an extremely efficient but polite way. My only complaint is that they don't want to talk to you if you're on the phone, which is understandable, but for the calls you can't miss it becomes annoying to get glared at when the school calls, or the vet calls, or the funeral home calls, etc. Life happens, give me a bagel."}
{"text":"A great product made there.  Closest I have found to NJ or NY, having lived there, I do know the imposters."}
{"text":"The Bagel Bin is a great local place in Huntersville.  I have been here a few times for a quick breakfast sandwich.     In the mornings (especially on the weekends) the line is out the door.   Try have a large variety of bagels and can accommodate any request.  In addition to the bagels they also do sandwiches  in case you need a quick lunch.    Quality is always good.  Will repeat."}
{"text":"Great bagels. The line to order is out the door . Be prepared to wait. Took 45 minutes to get 2 bagels.its good but I won't stand in line that long again. I will only go if there is a short line."}
{"text":"Bagel Bin is one of my favorite places to get bagels here in Charlotte. Growing up on the west coast I was spoiled with bagels. It was tough intitally to find anywhere that had the same deli bagel vibe that I am used to. I absolutely love coming in here when I can to get their lox and cream cheese bagel and get a dozen more for my house. The women making the bagels are very fast and friendly and have such great energy. They also have deli case if you want a quality boars head deli sandwich with their fresh made bagels as well. I don't leave without a giant pickle from their pickle jar."}
{"text":"Reminds me of home (NJ)! Best bagels in the area by far!  I had the chocolate chip bagel with plain cream cheese and a small coffee (a breakfast special which included any bagel with plain cc). The coffee was meh, but that's typical of a NJ/NY deli, so it still met expectations haha.  My boyfriend got the everything bagel, also with plain cc.  They put way too much cc on the bagels, but you can always take it off."}
{"text":"Bagel Bin is our favorite spot for a quick breakfast.The bagels are fresh, the staff is friendly, and service is super fast. They offer up a variety of bagels and cream cheeses including lox! Check them out!"}
{"text":"THESE are REAL NY bagels. Best bagels in western NC. Period."}
{"text":"Not impressed at ALL. I have passed by this place a million times on my way to another business and it always appears to be very busy. I have always told myself one day I'm going to stop in there to see what all the hubbub is about. Well today was the day. I went in around lunchtime and the line wasn't very long but as soon as I got into line several more people arrived and the line became very long. I guess I just had a good timing. As I stood there studying the menu I could see that the young girls behind the counter were very busy making sandwiches. I didn't hear any foul language like some of the other reviewers said but I also did not get a very good vibe from them. When it was my turn, the young lady seemed to be annoyed that I was standing there. No smile, no how are you, no thank you for coming in - nothing. I had a few questions about the menu being that this was my first time but I was afraid to ask. So I just ordered a chicken salad sandwich on a Kaiser roll. When I asked if cheese came with it she just said \"I can put it on there\" in a tone that again seemed like she was annoyed by me. When I paid for my food I asked her if she had a menu that I could get she looked at me, rolled her eyes and said \"what now?\" I requested a menu again and someone dug one up from underneath the counter. Now, onto the food. Not impressed with the chicken salad. Very plain, a whole lot of mayonnaise, the bread was harder than it should've been for a Kaiser roll in my opinion. I may have been tempted to return to try something else on the menu however I don't want to deal with the nasty attitudes of the young ladies working there acting like they are doing me a favor by making me a sandwich that I am paying them for."}
{"text":"I went here based on the reviews, but found that they bagels werent very flavorful, or really new york style at all. Perhaps it was just the eggs bagel, but it was very \"fluffy\", not dense or chewy with a crisp outside like a NY style bagel. The place was also small and crammed, but service was good and prices were low. That might be why people go.... Ill try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"The place is always packed when we come (Sunday around lunch) and the sandwiches never seem to disappoint. I usually get a egg and cheese on a bagel toasted (only way to do it). Come early if you want a seat and quick service!"}
{"text":"Loved this bagel spot! Long line that moved quickly, fresh bagels that didn't need toasting and huge portions.  Great variety of bagels and cream cheese, reasonably priced AND a really friendly staff."}
{"text":"Came in because Scott said to, he also suggested walking here but should have mentioned calling ahead because I was about 20 minutes getting a sandwich. Not really such a long wait since there's usually a line and your order is made to order but still... There's a couple three ladies behind the counter making sandwiches, bagging bagels, and schmeering schmeer like you'd expect. Good selection of bagels (including egg, spinach, and hawaiian) plus some muffins and danish. I went with the 'Bronx Bomber' because a roasted beef sandwich with swiss & slaw on toasted rye shouldn't be too tough. Sandwich comes in just under a pound which is pretty OK. Meats are lean and moist, slaw is crisp and tangy, pickle is gone way too soon. Second time in called ahead for a Reuben: hot corned beef + kraut + swiss on rye with a pickle. Didn't quite get this one on the scale but it looked and felt every bit of 16 oz. Again the meats were fresh and flavory, the cabbage sharp and tasty, and the pickle gone too soon.  $8 for a $7.00 sandwich is not too bad but would it kill you to serve up a whole 1/4 of a pickle?"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The wait time in line to get a bagel was too long.. Possibly a new staff was the issue.. But the food was just as I adored in my local deli in NYC!"}
{"text":"The only negative thing I can comment on is the wait time. They should come up with a better method of serving the patrons quicker. The food is always of the freshest quality. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. They have a consistent staff who runs the place everyday."}
{"text":"Are you familiar with the Seinfeld episode, \"The Soup Nazi\"? Well, this place kinda reminds me of that. While the bagels are phenomenal, the staff seems very impatient, stressed, and at times rude. There was a line going out the door that day so perhaps feeling under pressure was the factor but someone needs to tell these ladies to relax and chill out. Maybe they want to give you that authentic NYC attitude but check your GPS sweetie, you're not in NYC, and don't roll your eyes at me cause I asked for my bagels sliced, that's your job. I talked to a few of my neighbors and friends about my experience and they have had similar experiences, then reading some of the other reviews here, I'm glad I'm not the only one. Management should gather all these \"poor attitude reviews\" and read them to his or her staff."}
{"text":"Place is awsome. Wish the hours were little earlier and longer in afternoon. But they def have great bagels."}
{"text":"We have been frequent weekend breakfast customers of Bagel Bin since we discovered them three or four years ago.  My husband and I always split a bagel with cream cheese, and a breakfast sandwich with either ham or bacon.  They are generous with their cream cheese and meats, and we love their NY style bagels.    The line for breakfast on weekends is usually out the door, but it moves fast.  And regardless of how complicated your order is, the gals never have any trouble remembering what filings go on what bagels.    I'd add a star if they actually fried the eggs for the breakfast sandwiches, rather than microwaving the eggs.  But they just aren't set up to be able to do this.  Regardless, we still get their egg sandwiches every time.    Definitely give Bagel Bin a try if you are in the mood for a delicious NY style bagel!"}
{"text":"First time here today... Great experience! Service was speedy and friendly. My bacon, egg & cheese bagel sandwich was delicious and I'll definitely be back to try more!!"}
{"text":"The food and especially the hard working ladies behind the counter deserve all the praise!! The service is always quick friendly and they always have a smile on their faces! Oh and the bagels are poppin too lol"}
{"text":"I hope that every person who follows me, everyone I know and anyone contemplating this establishment reads this first and NEVER bothers to give this place with the crappiest staff of all time a second thought. Earlier today my friend and I dropped in to grab some lunch.. the staff either all lost their dogs this morning, or just have the absolute worst attitudes you've ever seen in human beings. Not only was the nasty woman who served me avoiding any type of pleasantry but she was yelling across two other workers and a line of patrons asking what I wanted from the other end of the shop. When I asked the server for lettuce, onion and roasted red peppers on my sandwich she quite literally moaned very loud and followed it with yelling \"ughhhhh god help me!\" Before adding my toppings to my turkey sandwich. When one of the other servers asked us if our food was for \"here or to go\" the original server says aloudly \"to-go hopefully!!!\" Wtf... I'd love to know who this terrible human being thinks she is! I found my jaw on the floor more than once, wondered why she thought I was such a headache, and my friend and I decided right there that we would NEVER return nor would we let this review go untold to everyone we know!! I feel the owners somehow have to be to blame! How the hell do you allow someone so miserable represent your livelihood? You don't expect livelihood for very much longer, that's how.  Ps... maybe this server will look a little less \"I just woke up\" at her next job."}
{"text":"Recently moved here from New Jersey and was so happy to find bagels that tasted as good as the ones I was used to.  I went around 11:00 and there was no wait.  The people working there were friendly and even gave me an extra bagel to try.  I will be buying all my bagels from Bagel Bin."}
{"text":"This place is truly the greatest. The staff is friendly, warm and go out they way to give you that extra to make your visit a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I have always been a huge fan of Bagel Bin, and I still recommend it, but customer service is really imperative. I know this rating/review won't mean much, but I need to share what happened to me today.   After going to the AT&T store for almost two hours, I needed lunch. Logically, I chose Bagel Bin due to proximity. I usually get bagels, but I wanted a turkey sandwich on a toasted sesame bagel. So ... feel free to let me know if I did anything wrong here.  I opened the door to Bagel Bin at 1:45 p.m. Three points here:  1. I didn't look at the hours on the door prior to entering, which stated that the store closed at 1 p.m. on Sunday. My bad, but I think it's an honest mistake.  2. The door should have been locked if they were closed.  3. I was hungry.   The instant I opened the door, a female employee I had never seen before looked at me and whined out loud (frustrated head tilt included), \"Are you serious?\"   My reply, \"I guess that means you're closed.\"  One of the long-time (and friendly) employees said, \"You missed by 45 minutes.\"  My friendly reply, \"No problem. I'll head over to Jimmy John's.\"   I have learned something important about life (it took a while). If you're cool to people, they will be cool to you 99% of the time. That's a lock! In this instance, I didn't have a chance to be cool to someone. If she didn't have her wall up so high, I would have recognized they were cleaning, asked if they were closed, she would have said, \"Yes, sorry,\" and I would have been eager to return to Bagel Bin.  In her defense, it's possible she was having a bad day. I unintentionally say/do stupid things sometimes. I get it. I'll always give Bagel Bin another chance because the food is great and the long-time employees are way cool."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to trying this place. Came at 2:30 on a Wednesday afternoon and a worker flipped the \"open\" sign right in my face to \"closed\". Online it says they close at 4, wouldn't have drove 15 minutes if I had known they were going to close early for no apparent reason. Unprofessional."}
{"text":"I usually stray away from eating bagels down here because they are usually disappointing despite being \"NY authentic\". Well I'm pleased to say Bagel Bin did not dissapoint. I asked for a everything toasted with lox spread and they didn't look at me like I was speaking a foreign language. The bagel was toasted perfectly and an appropriate amount of lox spread applied to my bagel which tasted amazing might I add. The service was the icing on the cake as you couldn't ask for a friendlier staff that is very efficient. To sum in up: great produxt + great service + great prices=a very happy customer. Can't wait to try their deli sandwiches."}
{"text":"I think it's funny that for any given bagel place in the south, you'll have a handful of northerners be like \"This is the real thing!!\" and then another handful of northerners be like \"What are you talking about, this is NOTHING like the real thing\". Makes me wonder if there is such a thing as a New York/New Jersey bagel, or if it's just pride...  I work right across the street from Bagel Bin, so it's by far the most convenient bagel place for me. I will always, 100% of the time, choose Bagel Bin over Panera or Bruggers if I have the chance because of the quality of the bagels. Not coming from up north, I've never really experienced the true NJ/NY bagel experience so I've grown up blissfully unaware of what makes a good bagel, and why northerners always yell at me that I'm wrong about asiago being a real bagel flavor.  Whatever. I like asiago.  But you won't find that here (except on rare occasion). You'll find your staples, and probably the best everything bagel in Charlotte, if not NC. If you want CC, you'll get a massive amount of it. If you have too much, wipe if off, fuhgeddaboudit. They have a good Boars Head meat/cheese selection that they use to make a lot of sandwiches, but I haven't personally experienced this yet. Maybe next time I forget my lunch at home....  Bottom line, with the owners coming straight from NY and a line that says \"you better know what you want by the time we can talk to you\", Bagel Bin is legit and delicious."}
{"text":"Great staff - very friendly. Good bagels. The everything bagel was delicious. The place is really tight and it's like you're herded in and out. I didn't like that I couldn't see what kind of bagels they had until I placed my order, felt like a rushed decision. I didn't see any obvious signs of flavors by the entrance, but probably because they change frequently.  I would come back here because there's no brueggers anywhere nearby it seems and Starbucks bagels are nasty and paneras are overpriced. They were priced great here."}
{"text":"Ok, the best way to get your bagel... call in your order ahead of time.  This place is ALWAYS packed and quickly runs out of many of the popular bagels.  I've been getting bagels here for years and they are a staple of the community.  They offer always fresh bagels and plenty of smiles from the girls in the assembly line.  Everyone is super friendly!   The only downside is that they have outgrown their space.  The tables are always full.  My favorite is the Asiago Parmesan with egg and Muenster cheese.  The parking is plentiful with it being in the same plaza as Target.    Definitely check them out!  It's worth the wait and experience."}
{"text":"I got the Ruben sandwich and it was delicious. I can't wait to try the breakfast sandwiches as well. It's a convenient location from my home."}
{"text":"OK, who ever makes the bagels in this joint, 5 stars to you're great bagel making ability. The everything bagels were on point. If I'm around Huntersville again, I might stop in for the bagels. However, the reason for my lackluster score is literally EVERYTHING ELSE.   I wanted to get a good sample of the place, so we ordered bagel with butter, bacon egg & cheese, and a Reuben. Only thing I'd eat again was the bagel. The main cooking appliance for cooking in this joint in the microwave, eggs included. Nasty!! There is no flat top to be seen! I've never been to any NY deli serving hot food without a grill or flat top.   Another reason I will hesitate to come back is the staff. Very loud, rude, pretty much the customers were an interference with whatever they were talking about. I'm all for camaraderie, but this was just obnoxious. Great everything bagel is the only reason for not getting 1 star.   Poppyseeds Bagel is still the #1 bagel deli in the Charlotte area by far."}
{"text":"Hailing from Jersey, I'm spoiled when it comes to bagels but this place makes a decent bagel and the staff is super friendly. I had the lox bagel with everything and it was very tasty!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I work nights sometimes and this is my stop on the way home! Love the egg bagel and veggie cream cheese. Def my go to every time!"}
{"text":"Please note that this review is mainly about the sandwiches and with that in mind, 5 stars.  Can the staff be ornery sometimes, yup.  They can also be friendly and chatty.  Does it take a while to get said sandwich when the line is long (that means still inside, to the door)?  Yeppers.  All that said, the sandwiches are very, very good.  Quality Boar's Head meats and served on the Bin's bagels and as much as anything it's the latter that's what really makes the sandwich.  Those bagels are as good as I've found in Charlotte and certainly beat the heck out of options from Panera, Einstein's, etc. Throw in that the meats are piled high and the veggies are fresh and, voila a 5 star sandwich.  My fave... Roast beef, turkey, provolone with lettuce, mayo, S&P on a toasted onion bagel.  Go and get one."}
