{"text":"This place felt like home the second I walked in the door for the first time a couple months ago. Ive tried the jerk pork and the jerk chicken and both were outstanding. I'm also allergic to carrots and couldn't eat the coleslaw but after the head cook heard that he went out of his way to make me a side slaw from scratch without carrots. Noones ever done that for me, so it was kind of a big deal, plus... it was amazing! Highly suggest this place to anyone that wants real home made style Caribbean cooking."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Gerry's for a few years now but it still remains my fav. place for roti in T.O. I always recommend it because of their most tasty goat as well as chicken roti.
Nice fresh dough as well for the wraps.
Good times. 
Gotta make a trip there over the holidays."}
{"text":"If it's Friday or Saturday, do yourself a favour and order the ackee and saltfish. It's the best. Home style island food with friendly service.

Another reviewer complained about being asked to step away from the door... it's only because the doorbell is on a sensor and will keep ringing until you step completely inside."}
{"text":"I tend to only post when I love or hate a place.  I found myself reminded over East of how much I loooooove Gerry's.  I went in to stock up on sweet potato pudding for a visiting friend and succumbed to a goat roti.  They really are, I think, the best in Toronto--not just great cooks and great bakers, a combo hard to find in most of the West Indian places in Toronto, but they start with quality ingredients.  The meat is a good cut and there is a wonderful absence of the oily scum many places seem to believe imparts authenticity.  And their fruit cake--ooh aaahhhhh!  Finally, their prices are reasonable, perhaps because, unlike a lot of places, they play first to their own community, something I think accounts for the always pleasant and friendly atmosphere here.  Good folks, good food."}
{"text":"I was offended when I was asked to \"move away from the door\" upon my first entry into this hole. (BTW, it's an outward swinging door and in no way was I impeding other patrons' entry). I ordered a beef roti and a beef patty.

As I munched on my bitter beef patty which had an \"off\" flavour, the cook came out and told me they had no beef. So I switched to chicken.

Almost 20 minutes later, my teeny package of roti arrived, wrapped in household wax paper and aluminum foil which made it particularly hard to open. I got to the nearby park to eat it and found that it had no cutlery (which I usually get with to-go roti). But in this case, it wasn't required because it had about as much filling as a beef patty, next-to-none. And most of that filling was bone. And the flavour was bland and under-salted. The roti shell was dry and chalky.

I won't think twice about never returning."}
{"text":"Been coming here for awhile now, always consistent and is a friendly family who run it. It's been around since the 1950's. Make sure to check out this piece of Toronto's Carribean history, and get yourself some delicious home cooking too. #Jamaica #curry #yum"}
{"text":"Tried the curry goat and oxtail  with rice and peas. Not too bad and I like how the sauce was not overly salty. Portions are also large so you get a filling meal. I still prefer the oxtail at Randy's or P Jays which I think are run by the some owners."}
{"text":"Zang!  That's a great patty.  Too bad they only come in mild and not spicy"}
