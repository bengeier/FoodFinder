{"text":"The only food that was good was the chicken wings , The Pasta and meatballs were gross and the shrimp scampi was disgusting, The pasta was burned and only had white wine no garlic nothing i was sick Never would I go there again"}
{"text":"Well as you can see from the reviews, all recent reviews are stating how terrible this restaurant is I saw that the reviews months ago were five stars, must have be different owners or management, I've never been in this restaurant but I've ordered delivery twice and each time I had a problem with missing items I purchased and how long it took to be delivered, close to two hours they are 10 minutes away, for simple items like salad, Philly sandwich, cheesecake, chicken wings, Pizza and everything taste like items you buy at 7-Eleven or Circle K... Ridiculous! They will not get another damn dime from me"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night, 8:30.   One couple at one table.  A family of four at another table.  During the time we were there no one else came to dine in.  Asked for coffee; was told no, coffee is not served.  They serve breakfast (or at least the sign says that they do).  I guess the  espresso machine in full view at the bar is not intended for dinner?   Several people came and went who had ordered pizza to go.  I think that is what the management prefers.  The music (radio) was annoying.  2 televisions - one playing a 20 year old Adam Sandler movie and the other was showing Doogie Howser reruns!   I know we don't go out to eat to watch TV, but I can take a hint.    The pizza was very good.   I will make mine to go from now on.  Would have given four stars if not for the odd, slightly uncomfortable vibe."}
{"text":"The pizza was so good, lots of topping choices and it was a great value. The garlic bread by far was the best part, delicious! Not having to pay delivery fees was pretty awesome too. Definitely ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza from them on Yelp they charged $48.62 then about 30 minutes later they called and said they have to cancel my order due to maintenance."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pepperoni pizza, wings, and cheesecake.  The pizza had literally no sauce, and way too much cheese! One of the worst pizzas I've ever had.  The wings came in 6, and was the smallest wings I have ever seen. This place is awful."}
{"text":"Ordered desert to satisfy a sweet tooth. Tiramisu was frozen and preportioned... very disappointed,  both my husband and I feel we wasted money as tiramisu had a grainy texture due to being frozen."}
{"text":"Update to my review: They responded to my posting and THIS shows me that they truly care about not only the customer but the very food they are serving. Customer service is alive and well here @ Divinos.  I've had my Cox service switched quite a few times and I understand that it's frustrating as all heck when you get a new number but it happens to be an recently active old number. You get all sorts of strange calls.  I did actually get a chance to order up some pizza and mozz sticks.. BOTH were yummy!! Nice crust, thick sauce with some consistency (not like a watery mess), slices were good to perfection and they use really good cheese!! I highly recommend this place!!! I loved it and and will be back again!"}
{"text":"I could write a novel talking about how amazing this place is. But why do that when I can sum it all up in one word? \"\"AWESOME\"!!!  Pizza is very good. Sandwiches are over stuffed with delicious meat. Pastas good.   But one thing that makes this place rock is the staff.  Family owned and operated. Nicest people you can ever meet. When my wife and I eat there we are treated like family.   And on Friday and Saturday nights it's connected to Cloud 9 night club. Perfect date night."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing and great price haven't tried anything else but love the pizza definitely recommend the large 28 inch it's awesome"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! I have been here several times and are usually just get the wings and fries. The fries are nice big steak fries and they are delicious! My whole family loves the wings. Today I tried something different and I got the Philly cheese steak.OMG!!!! It melts in your mouth. I highly recommend this place. It's just a small little place kind of hidden. What does the best places? The little hole in the wall places? Great food! Great service and I'm always happy."}
{"text":"Ordered the bambino and only received 12 wings when it says 24. Guy I talked to said \"yeah it only comes with 12 that's why it's cheap.\""}
{"text":"Oops - sorry Pizza Divinos is on Cactus.  Both have great food made with fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this location thinking it was Pizza Divino on Cactus...figured it was the same place, different location, but the quality between two identical orders in each place was different & we definitely prefer Pizza Divino on Cactus. Most noticeable difference was the wing quality. This place wasn't bad, but I wouldn't say it was as good as the Divinos on Cactus."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and wings. Try out the Honey Hot wings as they are awesome.  Great place and they do Family night on Wednesday from 5 - 8 PM."}
{"text":"First time ordering from Divinos, through Uber Eats, and it was so good!! We got the sampler so we could try their wings and mozzarella sticks, delicious!! The marinara was so good, I bet the pasta is great! We also got a small pizza which was also really tasty. We will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Best wings for the best price!!! Clean good people and you can't beat the beer prices !"}
{"text":"Wife and I both ordered shrimp scampi and asked for mozzarella sticks as an appetizer.  All the food arrived together, instead of the appetizer first. No issue with the mozzarella sticks, but the shrimp scampi had an inordinate amount of ground pepper to the point of being overwhelming.  Additionally, cooked green pepper was added to the recipe, which was odd.    We won't return."}
{"text":"I'm not going to sugar code this. You will have better luck ordering from a gentleman's club. I waited over a hour. I got BBQ wings that were extremely dry and overly fried, giving them a hard chewy texture. The BBQ sauce was almost pure vinegar with a bit of seasoning. I also got a order of monsterella sticks. The first bite I got a mouth full of oil and something that was cheese... I think.  Well to end on a lighter note customer service was okay friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place, went to a couple of private events there and just overall great atmosphere with an awesome staff. Food is to die for!"}
{"text":"The pizza was bland, too much crust, no flavor. The cheesecake was inedible, I don't know what that was but it wasn't a cheesecake. I took one bite and threw it in the garbage. The calzone was too doughy and baked with marinara inside instead of served on the side, and bland. Wow just all around bad. They better come around quick if they plan to stay competitive."}
{"text":"Finally I found an awesome Italian Pizzeria that you can bring the whole family to without breaking the bank! Considering that this is a pizzeria in the west coast I wasn't expecting much, walked in sat down had excellent service freezing cold beer! Then came the grand finale the pizza... Fresh mozzarella you could taste rhe freshness, freshly baked cheese was falling off of the bread absolutely delicious sauce you gotta come try this place out!"}
{"text":"Great night life ambiance. Owner always on-site and welcoming to guests. Food is extra large portions and the food is FRESH!  The night I went there must've been a party of 250-300 and I met some great people. MUST TRY THE DIVINO SHOT!!!!!!! Yum, a dessert in itself."}
