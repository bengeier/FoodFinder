{"text":"Ended up going here after a hockey game on a Saturday night. I doubt if I will be back. The place has all the ambiance of a cafeteria. Hard floors, hard walls, lots of noise, and the place wasn't even crowded.
The food took forever to get to our table, okay it was 45 minutes, and it's not like we ordered difficult foods to make. Wings, Bruschetta, etc. No explanation why it took so long. Food was mediocre, just like most of these places."}
{"text":"it's the local bar. 

it recently went a name change and a facelift (kinda) but it's still whatever.

this place use to be really good with their service and food, but lately it's been declining. 

I give it 3 stars because their wings are still
delicious and that's the only reason I go there. they're not small and still very tasty. I couldn't recommend anything else on the menu because I gave up on that years ago."}
{"text":"Formerly known as Turtle Jacks and Tee Jays, this place has recently come under new ownership, but thankfully they did not drastically the menu. The food here, such as the various sandwiches and burgers , is generally quite good. They have daily specials on different items. My favorite thing in the menu, and the best value, are the wings. They abolished the small ones, and now only carry the larger ones. To make a good deal better, they are half priced on Mondays. I now have a few of my friends hooked on the half priced wings. $15 for two pounds and a pop ain't a bad deal. My favorite flavour is Buffalo butter, followed by mango habanero and creel dijon. The latter gives me heart burn, but I still enjoy it. The only downside to this place is that the service is less than spectacular,  and the interior needs work. Meh, as long as the prices stat low, I  am ok with that as it is essentially a  bar."}
{"text":"Worst place ever.  8:00pm I came here with friends to enjoy the basketball game and eat some fish and chips. I had a table of 11 people and it took them 20 minutes to take our order. Half our table ordered fish and chips and it took them another 20minutes to come and tell us that they don't have any fish left.... we ordered and at 9:15pm  our food came out one by one. Thanks for a waste of 2 hours."}
{"text":"Sitting at The Kort Haus. Half of us have food, half of us don't. After waiting an hour and a half we decided that the only way we're all going to eat is if we share the few dishes that did come out. 

I was one of the lucky people... I got my steak sandwich but the bun was so burnt that it was unedible. It came with 3 mushrooms, 2 un-carmelized onions, and a steak so dry it was like I stuffed my face with kitty litter. 

3 bottles of ketchup on the table... no ketchup in any of them! 

I can go on but i'll stop here. Do not eat here!!! Food sucks and service is slow. Wish I could give this place a zero."}
{"text":"*3.5 rating*
Came after softball for obligatory wings and beer. The place is fairly nicely decorated and open; however we went with the patio with it being summertime.

There's a pretty large menu, but I was in wing mode. There's over a dozen flavors and you can have them breaded or regular. The wings are about $11 per pound - and they stick to the true pound: so about 7-8 larger wings. They do offer slightly cheaper for every extra pound, but emphasis on the slightly (like 25 cents). Not bad, but not great value either. That said, they do have a wing platter at just over $13 which includes a pound of wings, a side, dip with carrot and celery, and coleslaw. That's actually great value.

I had the habenero-mango. They were spicy, and I could detect some tangy-ness - but the mango could've been a little more evident. My wife had the same platter but had the standard hot. We both felt the wings were solid and worth getting again - albeit not much to distinguish themselves. Our sides could be described the same.

It's enough to try again, and I know from the YELP event that their burgers are pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is Closed.  The landlord has distrained and locked out the former owners of this place."}
{"text":"Was invited to a yelp function and the turn out was amazing. The Kort Haus had a great assortment of quality pub foods from fries, cross hatched potatoes, chicken wings and chicken and burger sliders. Full proportions and assortment of dips. And the craft beer from Beaus and Lake Wilcox Brewing was great."}
{"text":"Visited during Burger Binge Week #2.

At 6pm on a Monday the Kort Haus was quite empty. We were seated and served immediately. Out of my party of 3, 2 of us ordered the Yelp $5 Burger special and the other decided on the Monday half-priced wings deal. 

Service for the most part was good at the Kort Haus, but we had to wait over 40 minutes for our food. Our waitress came by about 30 minutes into our wait to tell us that the order wasn't received in the kitchen because they had just programmed their system for the Yelp special (It was the 2nd day of the promotion). She said that it would be another 10 minutes and apologized for the wait. Fair enough, so we waited another 10 minutes and our orders arrived.

The burger itself was presented very nicely, stacked high and exhibited all its many ingredients. The mixture of flavours was new and very tasty. There were a lot of ingredients... From Yelp's Event page: [jalepenos, jalepeno havarti cheese, crispy onion straws, homemade Buffalo butter sauce, lettuce tomatoes, pickles, jerk aioli, in a toasted potato scallion bun]. The burger itself [prime rib burger stuffed with jalepenos, roasted red peppers and a medley of cheeses] was just alright and was definitely not the highlight. However, the mixture of the other stuff definitely helped the burger still taste amazing as a whole.

The Kort Haus also has many TVs for your viewing pleasure. At the time we were there, they were all set to the Jays game. One thing I did notice was that not all of the TVs were HD.

The patio outside also had a couple of outdoor TVs, which was a nice touch.

Overall, my first experience at the Kool Haus was pleasant. The food and service was good, but as a customer in a restaurant with not too many people, 40 minute wait times are simply unacceptable, regardless of the circumstances. I'll still be back though, that burger was quite good and I'd like to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"I came for the burger, stayed for the burger and devoured the burger.
I was a huge fan of the burger The Kort Haus offered for the burger binge week, it was cheesy with jalapenos galore, what is not to love?
We also ordered the poutine and that was a huge let down, the gravy was terrible, it was so thick and bland..it tasted like one of those cheap packs of instant gravy, not something you wanna pay for at a restaurant. 
The service was pretty good, it was a quiet Saturday afternoon and we received our food twenty minutes after ordering.
All in all, a pretty good first time but based on the menu I don't know if there will be a second."}
{"text":"I really cannot give it full 5 stars because i just went for the burger binge week. I just ate my burger n left so i'll just base this review on that. 

The burger was ok. It was tasty but will the ingrrdients (jalapeno peppers, spicy havarti cheese etc) i thought i would get a kick in the spicy department. That failed but it was a tasty burger.

Dont know how the place would be during a busy time but i'd like to try it again with a couple of friends for one of their daily specials."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. The waitresses are (were?) nice, but service has always been on the slow side, the place has look run down for years, and while the kitchen was visible on the way to the can, it was rarely an encouraging sight.

As of Aug 7 2015 the landlord had padlocked the door, so look elsewhere for now."}
{"text":"2nd visit here and this time I brought the wife and we had 5lbs of delicious wings for the half price Monday special! (see my pic) 

We tried various sauces like the honey garlic and the x-treme buffalo butter. Our favourite sauce was the creole Dijon. 

Service was better this time as our waitress was much more attentive.  Our food also arrived quicker. 

This time I'll give it 4* overall. 

I'll be back!"}
