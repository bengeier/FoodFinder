{"text":"Ordered cashew chicken but it had peanuts not cashews. Either they don't know the difference or they are cutting costs. Makes you wonder what else they substitute? Also, the staff is not friendly, very abrupt and rude."}
{"text":"Good food but read news articles on it. They cooked and cut roadkill in here. Go here unless you have any concerns about the safety of their cooking or your own well being."}
{"text":"I don't usually give bad reviews but if you don't stand up and say something then you're part of the problem.   I am Chinese and a select group amongst us need to stop doing this crap.   I hope it gets shut down and they just leave the country. They are giving other Asian folks a bad name.   http://6abc.com/food/restaurant-manager-seen-hauling-roadkill-into-eatery/1168144/"}
{"text":"If it's time for lunch and you are really hungry, this place is a must!  There are a host of $4.95 lunch specials that include entree and eggroll or soup.  You can eat in, or take out.  The downside to eating in is the table service.  The food is served in a three compartment takeout box, and the plastic silverware is way too small!  I might just bring my own untensils on my next visit."}
{"text":"FUN!!!!!!!!!  Well, not really, but thats what the name says.  This is your basic sauce ladened, sodium drenched, cheap/quick lunch chinese spot.  Everybody needs one, but this one just ain't mine.  I stumbled accross this place while roaming through concord killing some time.  It didn't look that promising, and I got what I expected.  Lots of food, for a good price.  It wasn't good food, but it was lots of it.  Be wary, but decent for a luncheon quickie."}
{"text":"The food is good, until it isn't. Definitely cheap and the portions are large. However the old saying you get what you pay for is true. Lunch special is $5.25 delivery is extra.   However the fun, friendly staff is absolutely non existent. Ordered lunch today, like very many days for my whole staff. And when I called to let them know there was a mistake with one. The lady in the phone was super rude."}
