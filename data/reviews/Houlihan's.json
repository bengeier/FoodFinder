{"text":"Servers are very sweet to your face then go into the back room and roll their eyes and make inappropriate gestures. Were here for valentines day and expected A LOT better....... Very disappointed. Very."}
{"text":"Wow, impressed.  Not the Houlihan's that I remember.  Definitely changed for the better!

The starter menu had a great selection.  We ordered bruschettas that came with goat cheese and olives.  I was skeptical of the goat cheese...but, oh my goodness...YUM!  I forgot for a second that I wasn't in San Francisco!

Key Lime Pie martini.....absolutely necessary.

Completely new menu.  Asian dishes, fish, meat....a huge, wide variety.  When I think of Houlihan's, I used to think of typical chain American restaurant with nothing but fried food and burgers.  Not anymore!

Check it out.  Worth revisiting."}
{"text":"Went in with the family around 11:30 am on a Saturday.  There was no one in the dining area but when we left about an hour later the place was about half full.  Our server (Matt) was efficient and polite.  Ordered a side of mashed potatoes for my infant son.  They showed up a little too fast, as though they we sitting in a warmer waiting to be scooped out.  The wife ordered the angus burger minus the bun (she has a gluten intorerlance) with fries.  She enjoyed both though she thought the burger was just a little over done even though she asked for 'close to well done'.  I had the spinach, berries, goat cheese and chicken salad minus dressing.  It was very good though the chicken seemed a little sparse.  When it comes to chain restaurants, Houlihan's is average.  I will go back again when I'm at the mall."}
{"text":"I like Houlahan's food and they have a nice selection of meatless items. This particular location presented us with genuine friendly service, which was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Love the options here. Always get the scallops and risotto. It's delicious! Family friendly, good kids menu and choices."}
{"text":"Love the ahi tuna salad and the French onion soup ! Great happy hour prices as well !"}
{"text":"Staying at the iHotel for a conference. Pleasantly surprised at how good the food was! Tomato bisque (with grilled cheese fritter) and veggie mini burger were yummy and both tasted freshly made. Very quick service. Friendly bartenders both nights (sat at bar)."}
{"text":"Karlee was our waitress and she was awesome. We had 20 people in our group and she was efficient and delightful. Food was good. Ahi tuna salad good, grilled shrimp and mojo sausage was good and salmon was great. Best appetizer was egg rolls."}
{"text":"I have had many visits here, to the inside and outside.  One of my favorites to go for business lunches or happy hour.  Great food selection, have never had anything I didn't like.  They put their own little touches and flares.  Get a wine or martini flight to enjoy on the patio while they cook your food outside as well."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for happy hour for the older crowd. Great for and old girl like myself looking to find 'Mr. Rightnow'. Also love parking below in the garage-instant Super8!"}
{"text":"Hmm .. well this place sucks. I would not try this out. The only thing good about this place is their service. Their local drafts are ok. I just was not ok with the quality and the taste"}
{"text":"In Cleveland for a Tiger game on the 4th of July.  Had a hard time finding something open for lunch. Found this place and I am so glad I did. Had the spinach salad with shaved chicken...perfect! Highly recommended.  Also the Tuscan white bean salad is a must. I might make another trip to Cleveland just to eat here."}
{"text":"For some reason we keep ending up going back here. Every time we do, the service is horrible. You have to keep asking for the same thing over and over. Expect at least an hour waiting for the food to be prepared. If you can stand the horrible service, the food is not bad. We definitely prefer the Houlihan's in Strongsville!"}
{"text":"Don't come here on game day because you'll get a \"special event\" menu and there isn't anything good on it.  Yes this makes it easy for kitchen and staff, but it inconveniences the paying customer.  Why even stay open.  The service is ok, but you can tell some employees don't want to be here.

Skip it on Illinois game days."}
{"text":"A shout out to Heather who helped me organize a dinner for  50 people in their private room which was beautiful. Emily and Savanah were our Amazing servers that kept up with the drink orders and food. You kept our hungry high school swimmers happy! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Decent food terrible service practically have to beg the staff to wait on you in the bar area"}
{"text":"Food pretty good, service needs work. I've been here many times and usually everything is fine. Not great, but fine. Yesterday I brought my Mom in for a late lunch. The place was quiet, only a few tables were full. Waitress was very kind and friendly, took our order promptly. When the food arrived, Mom got her soup along with her entree at the same time. By the time she finished her soup the entree was cold. No big deal, we thought, let's ask the waitress to re-heat. Unfortunately our waitress paid little attention to us and kept disappearing for long stretches. Eventually someone else reheated the entree for Mom. When the waitress brought the check she offered to box up our leftover dessert (huge portion). We thanked her and she took the cake away to be boxed ...and never returned.  I'd say 3 stars for food, 1 for service."}
{"text":"I have visited other Houlihans and this one is the worst I have ever seen! Place is so disgusting. The floor is super sticky and you can see crumbs everywhere. The plate my salad came on was obviously dirty. The spoon that came with my soup had water stains on it. So much for a fancy restaurant. I could hear the inappropriate conversations the employees were having behind that large glass that separates the kitchen from the dining room table. Just because we cant see you doesn't mean we can't hear you. Gotta love seeing dirty tables while everyone stands around on their phone. This place is a joke! Also after seeing their last health inspection I definitely wouldn't recommend coming here. Dirty dirty dirty."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was pretty good.  We had the blue cheese bacon bites to start off and they were unique and very tasty.  I had the rosemary chicken, vegetables, and mashed potatoes and it was ok.  I didn't eat all of the chicken, the potatoes were good, and the vegetables were swimming in butter and seemed a bit over cooked.  The drinks were overpriced but for a nice night out, this was a good choice."}
{"text":"I have to say service was good ,food was delicious, and it was a great dining experience forsure!! New favorite place .Check them out"}
{"text":"Houlihan's is so inconsistent that I've come to avoid it because of the better-than-not chance it will disappoint. It's a shame because I really thought/think that it has the potential to be a really nice little place.

I've been there three times and each time the experience was uneven. I really liked a sandwich I got there, but found the appetizer I ordered to be overpriced for the size. The service ranged from great to downright awful-- so bad that we had to ask for the manager, something that I have never done before. 

With all this said, the drinks have been consistently good and I would probably still consider it for just getting a drink, and maybe an appetizer, particularly if I was staying at or visiting the i-Hotel."}
{"text":"Yesterday we had an early dinner  here with friends. Three of us ordered the Barbecue Salmon Salad and it was fantastic! A generous, perfectly cooked piece of salmon with a light barbecue sauce was served to the side of the salad. The salad was a nice mixture of greens, mandarin oranges, spiced pecans, corn tortilla straws, served with a sweet citrus vinaigrette dressing. I would go back just to have this again."}
{"text":"Every time my family comes to visit Pittsburgh we come here because we all love the Filet Mignon here! The food is great and all of our steaks were cooked to our own individual liking. The meal is served with your choice of two sides (I got grilled asparagus and a twice baked potato- both delicious) and then as a meal add-on, my father and I got the firecracker shrimp. Literally the shrimp were AMAZING!! To top it off we had some type of cake for desert and it was also delicious. My mojito was also extremely yummy and overall I have not one bad thing to say about my experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a medium sized party  on a tight lunch schedule, so meals were preordered to save time. The waiter never introduced himself, never asked when our whole
Party had arrived and we had to ask for our meals which arrived at 12:45. Just about 5 minutes to eat before heading back to work. The others in the party said they could be a few minutes late so they were able to \"enjoy\" their food. I give quotes because I think my dish was terrible. Im not sure what the others thought but there were no oohs and aahs.I ordered the scallops which were small, way over cooked, and made me sick about a 1/2 hour later.  This is a major disappointment to be so bad when there is so much potential and talent in this town."}
{"text":"Great meal and service! Christian was very knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations. French dip and chicken tortilla soup both great - also salmon was very good"}
{"text":"Each time I visit Houlihan's I am reminded of how much I enjoy it! The menu is excellent and the taste of the food is even better. All of the prices are quite reasonable, especially during happy hour, which is one of the best! The half-price deals on drinks and good deals on delicious apps makes visiting Houlihan's from 5-7pm an irresistible deal. 
I always visit each summer for my birthday, when I am offered a buy one, get one deal on entrées, which is a great deal. 
As someone who lives in the city, I most often visit the Station Square location, which has a nice view of the city and an outdoor seating option that I like. The only downside is having to pay for parking in the garage. Years ago Houlihan's validated parking and that was a nice perk for that location."}
{"text":"Wow. That was really bad... My boyfriend and I went to have appetizers and drinks on the patio. Got a seat at the 12-person bar, but it took us about 15 minutes to get the attention of the bartender - - 3 feet away. No personality there! 

They were out of the beer I ordered, so I sucked it up and ordered a $10 glass of wine. The appetizers were mediocre at best. The  spicy chicken and avocado egg rolls were the mushy and the salsa horrible. The flatbread mushroom and arugula pizza tasted like it was on barely cooked pillsbury croissant dough and I think they forgot the truffle oil and seasoning. Patio was pretty, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"As we are having a class reunion dinner there, another committee member and myself went to \"confirm\" the food.  I had the prime rib, he had the scampies.  The prime rib was very good, but the scampies were fantastic!  
Beverly (the owner) took good care of us.  We were quite happy with the food and the service.  
And drinks were good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Food was mediocore. Way overpriced! Staff was obnoxious we sat near the kitchen so lots of traffic from employees. Offered no specials. Only thing positive was stuffed mushrooms. Atmosphere was mediocore as well. Pass coming here."}
{"text":"Great service but the food was horrible. Today is my birthday and we decided to check out houlihans in Robinson for the first time. I ordered a chicken fettuchini alfredo, it was overpriced and it didn't come with a side. It was dry, the plate felt like it sat in the window for 20 mins, the plate was hotter than my food itself. The noodles were so dry that i had to ask for extra alfredo sauce. The cook then gave me about an ounce size cup for my birthday meal. Thanks. And then to hear my husband and 2 kids also complain about their food was really the icing on the cake. My husband ordered the french dip which the bun was so hard and the auju tasted like hot water, he had to add salt and pepper just to give it flavor. Their kids menu consists of hamburgers and chicken fingers so we were forced to order a hamburger for my one son and my other son wanted shrimp so we ordered an appetizer without the hot chili sauce on it. When my son took one bite his mouth was on fire. I didnt want to make a big deal about it so i didnt say anything but it tasted like they accidentally put the sauce on it then dropped it back it the deep fryer to get the sauce off but the flavor was still there. We were so over it at this point, we asked for 4-5 boxes and left. We couldnt eat any of the food so we boxed it up just so we didnt hurt anyones feelings. My husband wanted to see about them singing happy birthday to me and giving me a free desert but it was just so disappointing at this point we just wanted to get out of there. We left and threw all of our food away. Our bill was $75 and on our way home, my husband was crying that my birthday was ruined and he worked all.day to pay for this dinner that was completely overpriced and discusting. I rate this a 1 out of 5 and the only reason is because our server was super friendly, this was not her fault she did everything to go above an  beyond to atleast try to make us happy. I didnt say anything to her about us not liking our food because i did not want to get anything free or anything like that. Im just writing this so that other families out there are aware that this place is an OVERPRICED eat n park!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could leave a 1/2 star I would. I understand busy and even mistakes but the lying...

A few weeks ago I made reservations for 6 12-26 at 1. I called again last week and confirmed them.

So we're inbound and there's a traffic snafu. We call and talk to the manager, tell her we'll be 15 minutes late, she said no problem, we'd probably have to wait another 15. OK.

Still in bumper to bumper 15 minutes later but right around the corner, we call, 'OK', still 15 minute wait.

Get there 10 minutes later. Surprise! A 45 minute wait. I explain nicely that we have a 85 year old with a 1 hour drive home, and could something be done, considering they just told us 15 minutes? (we easily could've gone somewhere else had they been up front in the first place!)

The manager said repeatedly, she's sorry, it's not table space, it's the kitchen, they're behind. But, she'd do what she could.

I said OK, we'll take it. By this time my family is outside (we have a smoker), I pop outside and explain the situation. OK it happens. We come back inside to be seated and - guess what?

This same manager, that I just explained about my 85 year old father, and who just told me it wasn't a seating problem, REFUSED to seat us, saying they don't seat until serving! 

I call BS and everyone knew it. I gave her ANOTHER chance to make it right and she just clung to her lie. Upon leaving I told her she earned this review. 

And, she did. We were going there because my dad liked them. Now, never again."}
{"text":"If you're visiting the university on business, there's a good chance they'll house you in the I-Hotel (reviewed separately). This is especially true if you're visiting offices in the research park. In such cases Houlihan's will be by far your most convenient dining option. I stayed at the I-Hotel last year when interviewing for my current job, and ate at Houlihan's both for dinner and breakfast. I don't even remember what I ordered for dinner, but I remember it being of good quality. Service was pretty attentive. They had live music that evening, but I left just as they were beginning. I don't know what the prices were because I didn't pay.

Breakfast was another story. The breakfast buffet was almost empty, so I actually had to ask the staff if I came at the wrong time. The lack of customers means all the hot items were cold and obviously not fresh. The scrambled eggs were stale and quite disgusting. I really regretted having breakfast here, even if it was only $9."}
{"text":"Great place!  Customer service is really good.  I had an issue there several months ago and stopped going there.  After writing to the company twice, I received a call from the Westlake manager.  He definitely made things right.  Now, this place is definitely back in our regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Does this make sense to you?  I ordered a half size salad today for lunch and the price was $1 less than the full size salad.  They have a nice patio and the staff is very pleasant and helpful but a dollar off on a half size salad is pretty nutty."}
{"text":"Carly our server was very good and why I could give one star. I ordered an Absolute on the rocks and the bartender gave me an Absolute Vaniila. It sounds like they ran out of Absolute behind the bar and figured it wouldn't matter. It took quite a while before they went to the storeroom to get a another bottle and my drink arrived seconds before my food. Ordered a burger cooked medium well and it was delivered bright red inside. Swear I heard it moo when I bit in. We ordered charred pineapple brown rice and it tasted like reheated canned pineapple bits with a heavy unmentioned peanut oil flavor."}
{"text":"Bad. Just bad. Nothing is special. Its overpriced. Horrible service. Horrible management. Food tasted like it came out of the freezer. Drinks from the bar were warm. Bleh."}
{"text":"Good drinks, good prices, good location. I especially like the special flavors of long island iced tea pitchers."}
{"text":"Real nice place to visit.  I had the Thai 'Noodle' Salad with the grilled Salmon and it was fantastic.  Very different and enjoyable.  We went with a group of 11 for lunch and it was an event to be remembered by all.  The atmosphere is nice, staff is fantastic and welcoming.  The food was very good and everyone enjoyed every thing they ordered."}
{"text":"Sunday night we expected it to be slow, diners that is. However everything was slow. I ordered a filet mignon-medium rare and my wife ordered an almond crusted tilapia. We waited 30 minutes for our food and my filet was over cooked. It had no sear marks and appeared to be oven cooked. How do you mess up a steak? The tilapia was thickly crusted with something, with little specks of what may have been almonds. I asked to have my steak redone and to their credit they obliged, agreeing it was not done correctly. As my wife picked the mystery crust off her fish, my steak was redone. The second steak appeared promising (sear marks visible), but the cook obviously did not time or let the steak rest because this time it was rare (raw). Now I enjoy med rare bloody, but not cold raw steak. We had enough. Asked for a doggy bag and may give my dog a once in a lifetime treat."}
{"text":"We went there at 5:30, thinking it would be busy on a Friday night and it was DEAD. That should be saying something...

My young daughter ordered a grilled cheese off the kids menu, and sadly it was half a sandwich. Really, I just paid almost $3 for my soda, but you can't afford the white bread that it would take to make a kids whole sandwich?!  Why don't you post that on the menu? 

We had wings as an app, which were okay...But nothing about them says I want business. I mean maybe a side of celery to the dish? Any dive restaurant that serve wings gives you that much...

I had fish tacos- which the waitress said was popular- and they were nothing special. 

I gave this place 2 stars only because our server was nice and on top of refills, checking in.  Otherwise, overpriced and not worth it.  

I should have used the money we spent there tonight to buy my wife that coach clutch at Macy's she was eyeing up...

Lesson: I will never trust a place that is completely dead on a Fri. Night during dinner hours!"}
{"text":"I am typically not a \"chain restaurant\" fan, but Houlihans is one of my exceptions. Oddly enough, I didn't find this one to be as awesome as the one we typically frequent. Food was just a little different. Service was a little rough. However, I must say the manager more than made up for it when we said something to her. As a past waitress, I am more than tolerant of waiting, etc. but it was a bit ridiculous. All that said, If your in town in need a decent meal (chicken wrap, fish tacos, burgers, salads) then I definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Run by a bunch of incompetent managers who have no idea how to take care of customers."}
{"text":"Champaign Houlihans is the best. I must say that Mina and his staff are attentive and try to service the best way they can. My graduate student friends and I were able to have a place to do work, then have drinks, and have a great time. The manager brought blankets, lit the Fire and made sure we had a great time. Thank you for the amazing time! We appreciate you !"}
{"text":"Houlihan's is kind of a pseudo fine dining version of a TGI Friday's.  The menu is similar to what I would expect from TGI Friday's, but the decor is a lot more trendy right down to the super obnoxious aluminum menus.  Although the menu items are fairly pedestrian, they have little twists (chevre on the bruschetta instead of the more expected mozzarella, for example) and there is a big focus on presentation.  This makes for wonderful looking food, but the taste doesn't quite hit the mark.  Some of the cool looking little food sculptures are also very difficult to eat.  My bruschetta came with a little minced olive tower that looked like a cross between a wine cork and something out of the cat box, which was none to appetizing.

Most of the food I had tasted OK, but the fried asparagus stands out as being notably bad. One of my pet peeves is tough asparagus, and the stuff here was enough to make me go postal.  It was over breaded, over cooked, and the asparagus was actually chewy.  Gross.  I couldn't bite through the asparagus, so when I tried to eat it, the asparagus slid out of the breading leaving a pile of greasy panko straws on the plate.  The horseradish dipping sauce was good, but lacked zing.  At $10 for a dozen bad pieces of asparagus, this should definitely be skipped.

As is usually the case with chains, the menu descriptions made the food sound divine but the taste did not live up to it.  It's not bad, mind you, it's just forgettable.  This was particularly the case with the \"mini desserts,\" which are actually full sized desserts; one is plenty for two people.  Thinking they were much smaller than they turned out to be, we got a $6 trio of pecan pie, banana cream pie, and chocolate cake.  All were very cold as if they had just been removed from a long stay in the fridge.  All were also very bland and had terrible texture.  The pies were both runny, and the chocolate cake was dry and made Hostess cupcakes look gourmet.  Like everything else, they looked fabulous, and were also very reasonably priced, but don't let that fool you.  They're really not worth it.  

So overall, I give Houlihan's a resounding \"meh.\"  It's not bad, but I certainly didn't find it to be particularly good.  I'm giving three stars because the service was better than I would expect from a newer place so close to campus, and they definitely deserve credit for having such a well trained and capable staff."}
{"text":"First and last time, I've ever been to a Houlihan's.  Nothing was memorable other than long wait for an empty restaurant and cold food."}
{"text":"I was hungry but wasn't in the mood for a big meal. I like Houlihan's because the offer small plates that include some healthy options. My dinner selection was all over the place I know lol. I ordered the mini veggie burger , Tuscan white bean salad and chips and salsa. The chips in salsa looked like it came from a jar. The veggie burger was just enough it had cheese and a coleslaw. The Tuscan bean salad was very flavorful. This place is always in my rotation it never disappoints"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on 9-1-17. They were basically empty. We placed our orders and received drinks and my salad. One hour later and two requests to the waiter later and we still had no food. The manager came over me and offered to comp our entire meal but at that point it wasn't worth it. Come on Houlihan's you're better than that (or at least you used to be)"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for awhile and remembered why.     Slow service. Long wait for drinks. Food cold. No compensation. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I stayed at the iHotel for two weeks and ate at Houlihans at least once a day. While there were definitely dishes that I liked more than others, nothing was ever just bad. Almost every dish I tried, I loved! Being that I was alone, I often sat at the bar and Nate took great care of me, remembering what I was up to in town and my preferred cocktail. The staff were gracious and kind across the restaurant. The only thing I am upset about it that this place isn't in NC!"}
{"text":"It's just your basic American restaurant, but one of my favorites. Everything is just really good; they have a nice variety to choose from so there's something to suit everyone's tastes. Sunday morning brunch is really good too. Not overly expensive; the stuffed shrooms with their ranch  (which has a little kick) are to die for!!"}
{"text":"We were there on Easter Sunday for an early dinner. The service was very good and the food was delicious. I had the Fish and Chips. Only thing were my fries were a little on the cold side, but the cod was perfect."}
{"text":"Have been going there quite a bit over the years....when corporate took over quality of food has gone down, smaller portions, less value, higher prices ...lost hometown feel. Now you can tell it's all about money...not the customer. They still do have the best patio around, I'll give them that."}
{"text":"Great service with good food. While the quality is not the best, it's certainly not bad. I got the filet with 2 others, all medium-rare, and the doneness was fairly inconsistent. So most were medium, while mine was medium-rare. Everything tasted great, but the overall quality is something that can fluctuate. For the price, I would recommend going here at least one."}
{"text":"They've got great drink specials during the week.  My love and I like to sneak away for a reasonably quiet dinner and drinks.  The menu options are unique with healthier choices.  We have been to this location a handful of times and the food its consistently good!"}
{"text":"You expect a certain level of a quality when you go to a chain, that's why you go there.  This Houlihan's doesn't measure up to others I've been to.  The service was awful, we waited 20 minutes for our waitress to show up at the table.  We then placed our order immediately so as to not wait even longer, and we saw her go to several other tables for very long minutes before even turning in our order.  So we waited another 30 minutes to get our food, which was NOT worth the wait.  I had the fish tacos, and the fish was dry and overcooked.    There are better places to eat in Champaign."}
{"text":"I love this place in the summer time. They have a nice patio with an open concept by having open doors at the bar to the outside. We loved our drinks and the food!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere and the quesadilla's are awesome.  The drinks are kinda expensive."}
{"text":"This is a good upper-mid range restaurant that has a good selection of food. I was very pleased with the calamari when I had it."}
{"text":"Went tonight around 6 pm. Nice weather so the lower patio area was pretty full. Walked in and it smelled like bathroom cleaner! Happy hour\" was 75 cents off some drinks. The server had a weird reaction to the request for separate check. 1 person got something other than what she ordered because the server misunderstood what she wanted. I ordered the veggie burger and was warned that it was considered awful by some people but the bar tender loved it. Description said it had \"ranch style greens\" that the server explained was a\"fancy term for mixed greens\"- it was actually shredded iceberg and chopped tomatoes soaked in ranch dressing. I scraped it off and bit into crunchy bits of black beans with a burnt taste. Saw the other side of my burger  looked like the sizzling skillet my friend's fajita was served on. Her toppings and tortillas came out about 5 minutes before the steak part came. Server explained service was slow because there used to be a  separate kitchen for the patio but now there's just 1 kitchen for the whole place. Don't most restaurants have just 1 kitchen? My burnt burger was comped. Not going back."}
{"text":"The service was good, long wait for food, the food itself was satisfactory. The Chicken Parmesan Sandwich was the highlight in my mind."}
{"text":"Been to Houlihan's a few times.  Good place.  I'd describe it as \"Generically Nice\" if that makes sense.  It doesn't really have character or a theme to it, but I do prefer it to other \"Chain\" restaurants.  Good place for a date or dinner with a small group."}
{"text":"Overall, just okay. 

The food was decent, but not for the prices. The wine flight was my favorite part of the restaurant (though none of the wine was actually 'good'). Good bar service, though it wasn't very busy when we went. 

Ahi tuna was fairly dry and not very flavorful; you really had to use the sauces to get a decent tasting of food."}
{"text":"Love the stuffed chicken breast. Great drinks, too! One of my favorite spots for cocktails :-) A little pricy, but over all, great place!"}
{"text":"This places blows! Very slow service. Don't know what the food is like waited an hr. Still no food. Manager had attitude when asked where our food was. At least the Coca-Cola was cold. Which they comped. Whoo-hoo(sarcasm)"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. A little pricey but they have stuff you can't find anywhere else. Recommend stuffed chicken.. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"The service in this place is a true disaster. We walked in on a Thursday at around 7PM, even though the place seemed pretty empty with a ton of free tables, they said we had to wait 15-20 mins to be seated with no real explanation. I would have been surprised if they said they were under staffed the place has 4 hostesses. We sat down, ordered an appetizer and had to wait another 45 minutes for our main course for no reason whatsoever. Do not come here."}
{"text":"I always forget how much I love Houlihan's. Guinness on Tap and The Best Baked Potato Soup On The Planet. 

Valerie was our server In the bar. Very polite

Love the buffalo chicken salad, tasty and fills me up"}
{"text":"Love the mushroom appetizer!  Always a good meal. Haven't tried the drinks but the iced tea is great!"}
{"text":"For a chain, it's off the chain.  I have always been partial to Houlihans, but unfortunatly, the only one I know of in Columbus closed several years ago, and I haven't been back to one til this visit.  I was pretty blown away by the menu.  Ordered a strawberry basil lemonade(with gin), and it was pretty good, but the food was just perfect.  I don't like mushrooms, but the stuffed shrooms got rave reviews.  The only thing that was so-so was the spinach dip, but I think thats only because I wanted the tuna app that looked really amazing, and I was bitter.  Guess I'll just thave to go back to try the tuna.  I have always stuck by the stuffed chicken which was perfect.  As a bonus, the server dropped the two bites that I couldn't finish, and made me another one to go, and it was just as good.  Friends had the pot roast which was \"just amazing\" and the enchiladas were better than any of the mexican restaurants that I have had since moving to Cleveland. 
Service started off a bit slow, as we were indecisive, and she didn't want to keep coming back to the table to bother us, but as soon as we started actually making up our minds, she was quite attentive, and very nice.  Atmosphere was semi upscale, but very relaxed, and being part of a mall, you could show up in a suit or sweats and not feel too out of place, though I wouldn't personally do the latter, you could if you really wanted to. 
Believe me, I usually save five stars for independent restaurants, and really cool experiences, but so far as being corporate, I would recommend this for a safe consistent meal.  Whatever they are doing, they have made some good decisions, and wish there was one a little closer to where I live."}

{"text":"They openly allowed racist comments to be made to the tv by a patron including, but not the least, \"hotentot\" directed at black waitress. Pulling the race card isn't my thing but when you don't address openly insensitive and disrespectful comments then something will and must be said.  Period."}
{"text":"Totally a nightmare. Cannot be salty anymore and It combines the worst part of litalian & Japanese & American style all together. What a disaster lunch."}
{"text":"We went here on Mom's weekend when campus and downtown were booked.    What an ice surprise.  I had the best veggie burger I have eaten.  Their own special recipe.  The fish tacos got rave reviews and the ironic steak was  very good.  Service was excellent.    If they would switch their burgers to homemade and not frozen patties they would have had everyone at our table pleased.  Also, the asian slaw and salad were super"}
{"text":"The food here is always good. Knock on wood we have not had anything here that was bad or poorly prepared. The kitchen management and staff do a great job.  Great meatloaf, chicken and biscuit, fish tacos, stuffed chicken breast. All solid picks. 

Really good atmosphere and nice bar area with TV's, fireplace etc. The only bad thing we have had are the rolls. Which you have ask for. They microwave them or something. Half the time they are cold or just not worth eating. But I can't knock them for something that is an only per request/free item. If they had a really good, hot and fresh bread they bring out as part of their normal service, we might be here twice a week or more. Can you tell I am into good bread? Lol. 

Great job overall from servers here too. They have always been really good."}
{"text":"Great food.  Today however they sat us by the super cold door and was chilly. Steak was dry and a little bit over cooked.  Generally experience has been good."}
{"text":"We held my daughters baptism lunch at Houlihan's today. The food was delicious and service was great. I always enjoy the food at Houlihan's, especially this location. I would host another large gathering here again soon!"}
{"text":"You are literally insane if you don't LOVE this food.  When I go, I always get the ahi tuna salad--it's amazing.  I also love the artichoke hummus.  I don't think anything I've ever ordered here wasn't enjoyable.

The staff is always very polite and quick."}
{"text":"They have changed the fish tacos and I do not like them as well as I did before.  If you sign up on Houlihan's website they send you a coupon on your birthday for a free entree up to $15.00.  I went today and ordered the Tao Chipolte turkey wrap with chips and salsa and french onion soup.  The wrap wasn't bad.  It had good flavor but the wrap itself was dry so it crumbled some.  The french onion soup was really good and the chips and salsa were OK.  All in all it was a good free meal.  The server was attentive and the atmosphere pleasant.  Very clean and chic."}
{"text":"Poorest customer service I've ever seen in not just the restaurant industry but in any service.  Manager was unbelievably rude.  Will never go back next time I'm in Champaign and hope nobody else makes the mistake of going here."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I each got the flight of martinis. 
The cons: 
First off it took nearly 15 minutes to get them in an uncrowded bar/restaurant. They were not presented properly on the black martini glass holder. PRESENTATION MATTERS! I've seen them brought out correctly before and it looks cool and feels fun. The martinis were good. I could critique each one but it is what it is. Oh ya... Fill the glasses up to the top! Very easily done. 

The Pros:
The martinis were good, they were. It was nice to try and assortment of different martinis. The flavors were all good, nothing special and could def be approved upon, but we are at houlihans. 

Over all, we would go back. it was good and fun. I think our experience could have been better with a more enthusiastic bar tender and drinks that were better prepared. But it was good. Remember: presentation matters."}
{"text":"If I could have given no stars I would. Worst restaurant experience in Chambana, again. Here for business lunch, group of 10. Out of veggie burgers, out of flatbreads, discovered both of these  several minutes after placing first ordering.  Waitress offered me the vegetarian alternative of a chicken salad; I explained to her that chickens are animals and murdered to be put in the salad.  Wait staff has messed up more than one order, can't remember who order what, meals are coming out one at a time. My suggestion, avoid and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Staying at the iHotel for the second time in a month. Staff is very nice but the lunch from Houlihan's was very disappointing. The tomato bisque was acceptable (I would give it 3 stars) but the flatbread was absolutely horrible (0 stars) -- oily, doughy, wilted arugula with 0 taste, and I am pretty sure some of the mushrooms were past their prime. The flavor and texture of the flatbread made me wonder if it was pre-made and then just microwaved, there was nothing fresh about it."}
{"text":"In Strongsville, OH you can't go wrong at Houlihan's for Happy Hour. $4.50 1/2 sized appetizers that are delicious, filling, and won't break the bank. Add to the tastes, they open the doors between the bar and outdoor patio allowing a nice breeze in. When in this area give it a try.

Service was good.
Cleanliness was good."}
{"text":"The service at Houlihan's is the slowest of all the places I've been to in Urbana-Champaign. We went looking for a server after sitting down and waiting for 15 minutes, and after he came, he took the longest time to bring the menu, drinks, bill, etc.

The food was meh, nothing that stood out."}
{"text":"The manager was the rudest person we have ever met.  Went in there last Friday night with 6 other people and we walked into the bar and grabbed a table that was open.  He walked over and started to berate our group for not checking in at the hostess stand.  Then he proceeded to slam down menu's for us and said in a rude tone \"Here are your menu's\"  needless to say his lack of professionalism forces us to leave this horrible establishment.  

I will never go back there and will tell everyone else to never go there!"}
{"text":"Stopped in there after the Penguins game, it appeared that the kitchen was closed but the manager Patrick went back and made us some shrooms'. Jess the bartender was great and suggested a few cocktails for my wife. She went for the bleeding rose and really enjoyed it.   We were both pleasantly surprised by the service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Excellent place to eat out near campus. Could do better with reservations. They have missed mine twice."}
{"text":"Great service and very good food.   Bartender has been very attentive and served a great pomegranate martini.  
Recommend eating/drinking here   

Went back for take out and they said it would be 15 minutes. I arrived at the restaurant early knowing food would not be ready.  Surprise the food was ready (like in 5 minutes) and i realized it appeared i got what seemed like pre-made. Food was not as good quality like it was made before as i ordered the same appetizer as prior visit.  Also bartender wanted a tip for handing me my order and taking my money on a carry out.  REALLY?"}
{"text":"nice change from the congested side of Champaign. would definitely go back but by 7:00 pm it started getting busy. i do wish they would use real bacon on the loaded baked potato."}
{"text":"If you're visiting UIUC and staying at the iHotel, highly recommend visiting this place. Delicious, friendly service, professional yet relaxing and calm ambience, Houlihans does not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is decent but nothing to get excited about. We just came in last night for a beer and an app.  Sat at the bar and watched the Buckeyes and the Mets/Cubs simultaneously. The service was a little slow, but nothing to get mad at.  My wife had a flatbread and I had the stuffed mushrooms. They were both average. The stuffing in the mushrooms is a bit much and I didn't like them as much as I expected from reading Yelp reviews. The flatbread was decent.  Wouldn't rush back but will probably return."}
{"text":"Simply OK. I've been to much better ones. I figured with the Tower City location that it might be taken up a notch from the others but I wasn't really impressed..."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a restaurant chain person but we were going for a friend's bday. I was pleasantly surprised as we had a large party, were seated right away and had 2 waitresses.  This place is huge inside and great for a large gathering. The private room in the back looked really nice to have an event in. I started off with an Angry Orchard-one of my favorite ciders. I def. recommend getting one of the large glasses of long islands as they are huge and come in all different flavors.  This is the place to go for happy hour as all the drinks are half off! For dinner I ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans. It was really tasty and enough for two meals."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this was so bad I have to save people from going there. Stood at the hostess stand for several minutes before someone from the bar decided to give us some attention. Our server was not pleasant, barely said thank you and the restrooms smelled horrible. They smelled like sewage and potpourri and they were missing pieces of toilet paper dispensers causing the roll to fall on the ground. No hook for your purse, just overall dirty. In fact, the place was overall kind of dirty and hasn't changed a bit and I haven't been there in almost three years. That goes for the menu too. Same old same old. Just awful. Upon leaving, we past several workers who didn't even look our way. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"A friend of mine swears by Houlihan's- she's pushed me over from thinking its mediocre to being a fan...ive been 3-4 times for lunch and the salads are good especially the one with blackberries.  Last night was my deciding factor on giving Houli's a 4 star rating...I had a deliciously comforting stuffed chicken breast served with mashed pots and asparagus.  It was a great meal!  The chicken had a parmesean crusted coating and the stuffing was a white cheese.  It was just what the doc ordered!"}
{"text":"i hadn't been to Houlihan's in ages. I'm glad we went tonight.

Since I'd last been there, they totally redesigned the place. It looks really nice. 

I had the Down Home Black Angus Pot Roast. It was delicious, although i don't get the fried onion garnish on dishes. They're not very good and are unnecessary. 
I had a hankerin' for some french fries so i ordered a side of fries also. they were damn near perfectly fried, though a little bit over-seasoned. 
Daneille had Thai Grilled Chicken. She always let's me try her meals for some reason and i thought it was really good also. 

Houlihan's has come up a number of times when we try to figure out where to eat and i've always put them off. Now i look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"I visited this Houlihan's for the first time last night. It was a celebration dinner for my commencement. 

The location is a little hidden, but once inside, the restaurant is absolutely worth it. The decor is beautiful. Low lighting makes for a romantic atmosphere. I would definitely come back here for a nice date! The restaurant was pretty large and I also spotted a beautiful party room.

Our service was amazing. The server was super attentive and gave us all great suggestions. There is now a new $18 3-course meal deal that they are doing on sundays. Two of the people at my table tried the deal and it was an incredible value. 

I myself started with a pink elephant cocktail, which was very good. My starter was a French onion soup that I would definitely return for. It was delicious! My entree was their delicious chicken stuffed with garlic and herb cream cheese, panko-crusted and deep fried. Basically, what dreams are made of. It was SO good. I finished my meal by sharing the creme brûlée mini trio with my mother. The trio comes with three, shot-glass sized portions of unique flavors of creme brûlée. I loved the chocolate rhubarb and the vanilla ginger!

I definitely will be returning here soon. I could see this being a great place for date night or to grab drinks after work with coworkers. The atmosphere is quiet, peaceful, and the staff is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Food always good. Too bad they hire inexperienced managers who don't realize WE are his income.  They just lost a ton of business by being disrespectful and immature  -- laughing that the order was incorrect"}
{"text":"Must try the mushroom appetizer - stuffed with Parmesan cheese and a horseradish sauce. We ordered ahi tuna salad - too much banana (props for their creativity though) & seared scallops with risotto. Quality of food was great and they had a good cocktail menu. Beer selection was ok."}
{"text":"We always enjoy our meals here! We even had our rehearsal dinner here. Inside, I enjoy the salmon. My husband likes the steak or the stuffed chicken. The patio has a great atmosphere. The service is a little slow outside, probably because it is so busy. The shrimp and fish tacos are ok.  Entrees are better.  The mushroom appetizer is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain. Definitely only do dinner or happy hour. Breakfast is a total bust both if you order off the menu or go with the buffet. The bartenders are excellent at customer service and very attentive."}
{"text":"Came at lunch time on a Saturday afternoon with the wifey. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and immediately brought to our seats. Our waitress was super friendly, our drinks never ran dry, and the food was fantastic. The wife had the pot pie, which was the best pot pie either of us had ever had. Just perfection. I had a burger that was also good, but hard to beat the pot pie!"}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times now and the food and drinks are very good, but the service is atrocious.  If you are going for lunch, expect to be there for awhile.  We have yet to go and not wait a ridiculous length of time just for a waiter or waitress.  Then, expect to wait forever for the bill.  I actually have gone to the bar on a few occasions just to get the bill, because the waiter or waitress never came back.  I am really trying to like this place, but can't get over the bad service."}
{"text":"An extremely disappointing \"brunch\" experience. The menu was limited and unappealing...did not offer lunch options at 1:45. Waited 10+ minutes after we were seated before we were given water. We ordered a very simple pancakes and Caesar salad with chicken. Our food was delivered quickly only because it was bland and rushed. The chicken was obviously frozen, thawed and grilled.. tasted processed and couldn't finish. The dressing 
 (on the side) had a long, gross noodle looking ingredient that made me totally lose my appetite!
We enjoyed Houlihan's in years past, but this visit was beyond enjoyable or worth the money!!! 
Hamilton Walkers is a much better choice!"}
{"text":"Service was slow, but new. Thai salad was mostly cabbage. Stuffed mushroom appetizer was bland. Both sound better on the menu."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visits at Houlihan's.  Meals are very tasty and staff members are nice.  The vibe there is really mellow (I usually go around 6pm)"}
{"text":"Its a chain and in a mall, but I don't care.   These are far and few between where I travel, and I was excited to see one here when I was in Pittsburgh on business. 

I had this stuffed chicken breast with garlic cream cheese and mashed potatoes and I couldn't have been happier.  Really hit the spot, and I was so full from it, I wish my hotel was within walking distance so I could have gone and taken a nap:)

Loved! Loved! my server, and I wish I remembered his name.  I am going to try to find it off my receipt.   GREAT Service !!!"}
{"text":"Houlihans is a spot I would generally not eat at since I know of much better independent spots downtown with similar prices. However it is near my work so on occasion I end up there with coworkers due to the proximity. I guess you could say it is good enough that I won't refuse to go there.

It is typical chain restaurant fair aka Fridays. Personally I think the food is a step below Fridays. I don't really like the decor or atmosphere at all. Servers are nice enough and they usually do a good job moving the lunch crowd. Some items I have ordered include the burger (not great) ahi tuna salad (dumb of me to try), soup and sandwich combo (acceptable), pot roast (negative), buffalo chicken salad (ok fried chicken tenders aren't my thing). 

My go to selection is a steak chopped salad. It is a decent cut of steak with a wedge salad, asparagus, some sort if potato and some Gouda cheese. You can see this in the picture minus the cheese block. The dish is a one of the higher priced items on the lunch menu at $16 or so but is tasty. As you can likely tell in the picture the presentation isn't the best. 

Overall the only reason I would go this place is convenience and even then only because someone else wants to."}
{"text":"Wow!! Used to be My Favorite Restaurant until the Monroeville Location closed HAD the Best Ranch dressing...where do I start! I've been eating Chicken Salads at Houlihans for 13 years. I usually place a pick up order at Station Square location the past 4 years has been going down hill! Romaine lettuce is wilted, Ranch dressing taste like Tangy Mayo, Polenta is either dark & Greasy, EXTRA salty or EXTRA Bland! 4 times I ordered The Mocha cappuccino cake was stale or had a stale bread smell to it. WTF Don't understand what the problem is GET IT TOGETHER PEOPLE! Fire the Management & the Cooks! That's probably why it's always so empty! Smh sad but I have to find a new spot! I will say There is still some Hope....the Mall at Robinson location is still pretty decent ; )"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Houlihan's last night-  the service was excellent and the food was pretty good. If you're planning to eat, I would recommend sitting on the restaurant side as I agree with some of the other comments here about service in the bar area being slow and the bar set-up is horrible. While I do appreciate live music- it's just too loud if you are trying to speak to each other during dinner."}
{"text":"Got right in after a late concert.  Server was friendly.  Limited menu, but food was good.  Price seemed a little high.  Our table and restrooms were clean.  They did forget my ranch, but just a small mistake."}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  The food is raunchy,  it comes out cold and the Restaurant was so cold inside I wore a winter jacket in the summer.  Avoid this place unless you are almost starving."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. 

Waited an hour for food after waiting an hour to sit down. Not busy at all. I was told that the wait staff told the manager not to sit more people bc the kitchen was a disaster according to one if the servers. But he did anyway. Took absolutely forever. Sporadically they came out and told us they were out of x y z.

I don't write yelp reviews often but this experienced forced this out of me.

Oh yeah, they served the toddlers food last. So, umm, if you have kids you'll probably be better off to find another place.

The manager said he was sorry but then started point counter-pointing me about the wait, where we sat, etc. Wrong move. He asked what I'd like to have done. Wrong move #2. You're the manager. You need to offer more than an appetizer the next time we return. Which will be never. 

I've given this place way more ink than it deserves. Again though, not. Going. Back."}
{"text":"Great Salmon Dish here! Cool atmosphere... but lame that they have a patio and occasionally decide not to staff it correctly so they close the patio on a beautiful summer evening."}
{"text":"So houlihans is one of those wonderful restaurants that gives you free birthday dinner if you sign up for their mailing list. I got the fajita with shrimp (not actually on the menu). It wad good, but they ended up charging me close to $20 for it... I think $5 more than the steak version is a little steep for shrimp but whatever. Sarah S. says the mushroom enchiladas are good too. Happy hour doesn't  include half price apps anymore. Sad-ness."}
{"text":"Overpriced and small portions, but oh so delicious. Nice location. Not so friendly staff though."}
{"text":"Visited once. Personally, I thought it was overpriced for the quality and quantity of food received, and the service was lackluster at best.

Five of us went after work for drinks; we didn't expect to have dinner, but we were all a little hungry, so decided to get a light fare before some went out to a party later that evening. 

I don't drink alcohol, so I ordered lemonade ($2.50, and it was just ok - not very tangy), and a cup of their potato soup, and house salad with blue cheese (each $3.95). I can't believe they don't have light French dressing......this is criminal.

I was disappointed that the server couldn't keep the salad orders straight; unfortunately, two of us ordered salads with white dressings; her's ranch, mine blue cheese (since there was no French dressing!). The other gal had to serve as 'taste tester' to determine which salad had ranch and which had blue cheese dressing.

For $11.26 (plus my decent tip since I'm not usually bitchy unless the service is really really bad!) I don't think I will likely return to Houlihans on my own free will. If however, someone really wanted to meet me there, I might go for the company and stop at McD's on my way home."}
{"text":"So here's the thing: after 4 times here the service has been consistently friendly but incompetent.

For example, today I got sat in a nearly empty restaurant, and the host forgot to bring a menu. She said she'd bring one right back, and then forgot (I watched her stand at the host stand, bored). Took 5 minutes to get one from waiter. 

This is the kind of thing you'd forgive as a fluke, but you watch and see table-waiting basics being flubbed all over the place. Last time, I watched *three* different customers standing up and approach a waiter stand asking to find their waiter. My service was slow, and didn't anticipate common needs (like a coffee refill at breakfast).

My food came out partially cold and partially hot, which is either a kitchen timing issue or a tardy waiter who left food sitting in the window too long.

Seeing as it doesn't seem to be one bad server, I'd guess this the result of poor training--which is usually a management issue.

If you can survive the service, the hip/classy atmosphere has rich dark wood, orange lighting, and attractive window bays looking at Memorial Stadium on the south tip of campus. The menu items I've had have been either decent or great.

Worth a try, I suppose, but bring patience."}
{"text":"Had dinner there Saturday night with my wife. Arrived a little after 6 and got a table right away - NICE. Our waiter was great and really took care of us during our visit.  We started with a nice glass of wine. Our food arrived quickly and was good. I wouldn't say outstanding but good.  I had the Brentwood sandwich.  It was tasty although the chicken breast was a bit thick for a sandwhich. (I personally would have pounded it and tenderized it a little - but that's just me!) The fries were a bit of a disappointment. They weren't really hot and appeared to have been pulled from the oil a little too soon. Still a bit white. Fries should be golden brown - right?

My wife had the fish tacos. The came out in flour tortillas.  Really?? Who eats fish tacos in flour tortillas? (use fresh corn tortillas man! - doubled up of course!) Anyway.  If they had been hand made thick hot fresh tortillas, well, that would have been a little better.   But these things looked and tasted like they were right out of the bag from the wholesale food supplier. Pity, the filling of the taco was quite tasty according to my wife. She ate the filling of the second one and left the shell.

The service - excellent. The food, well, maybe it was just bad timing.  I would definitely give them another shot. Check them out for yourself and let us yelpers know what you thought!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. Service is hit or miss. Food portions are small and the size fluctuates. The only good thing is the happy hour specials. 
I have been here 3 times and each time was a completely different experience. There is no consistency between the visits."}
{"text":"I want to give Houlihan's 3.5 stars but that isn't an option.

My movie-star handsome beau and I stopped by here to enjoy the patio for our post-errand-running Sunday.  I do love this patio.  It might be one of the better in the city with plenty of seating and an outdoor bar and an outdoor grille.  

I loved my Bloody Mary.  It was perfect; a garden in my glass, just the way I asked for!  My beau ordered the Frito Burger (Frito on the side) and it was a really good burger!  I'm not a big meat eater, but this thing was yummy!  I opted for the frittata which I was disappointed with.  It was more omelet-esq and I wasn't thrilled with the flavors.  This however, is not Houlihan's fault.  We split the white bean salad which was O-SO-GOOD!!!!  I would order that again and again.

I'd go back again.  There were several items that looked good on this menu.  And the patio is a great place to kick back with some friends."}
{"text":"Grilled Salmon salad is awesome! I arrived after a long day of travel in 3 cities and Gina was my server at the bar, she has great energy, be sure to ask for her, great service also"}
{"text":"Das Mann and I had a drink & a snack after a movie here.  The bar is nice.  The app selections were incredibly appealing to me, but hey, that's just me.  I'm sure others would find them very exciting.  My man & I opted for a simple chips, salsa, and quac.  It was all very good.  The drinks were ok too.  All in all, an average, a-ok place for a quick drink."}
{"text":"Should be HouliHand's in your pockets!
After this visit, it will off our list. Lunch portions were tiny for the price. Fish & Asparagus w/ cup o soup.$12.50. Chick tortilla soup =tasty. Then entree came.. server said \"Wow, looks bigger w/ the Fries.\" Single pc of Fish was so small I asked if it seemed ridiculous.. server said yep I'll get it fixed & took whole plate away. 20 mins later same portions came out but w/ 2 smaller pcs of fish! (See Pics)
Plus only got 5 pcs of asparagus, measly! Meanwhile wife was done w/ her meal. Her salmon was a tad larger but $15. They shoulda left my food to eat and brought out 2 extra pcs.. One I deserved, other as a 'make-up'. 
Plus no manager came to say boo. They want to charge you like it's uppity but not treat you uppity when there's a problem.  Side of slaw was merely a garnish -meager!
Server apologized and said all portions have shrunk in last year, huh ..bunch of Houli-gans!!

Houli-Cow! These prices are Magically Ridiculous!
Salmon Salad was petite for nearly $16. Plus they forgot her tomatoes. And very skimpy on feta!  SMH
My Asian salad was larger. Good I got dressing on side since it was not good for me, lucky chicken had awesome sauce on it I spread around! At $13 a lil more reasonable. 
Lunch hour was dead and dim in there.  'Guess twas kinda romantical'"}
{"text":"Delicious restaurant, kind of pricey but worth it! They always make you feel at home, as we go very often. Make sure to try the espresso martini, so good. The wings are excellent, but I wish they would bring back the Mac & Cheese."}
{"text":"Last minute,. Food was very good, my friend had the pot roast, she liked very much, p
  lenty left to take home
  I had a special, Mediterranean Chicken, portion was small but mighty on taste.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I was staying at the adjacent hotel (which is spectacular), and I didn't feel like driving elsewhere for dinner and decided to give this place a shot. It was a Friday evening, and there were very few other guests in the restaurant, but it still took 15 minutes for me to be acknowledged and another 5 minutes for me to be seated. My waiter had no knowledge of the menu and seemed to be quite new. He should not have been on his own. The food was of a poorer quality that one would expect from a fast food restaurant, though the prices said otherwise. The service form the waiter was poor from start to finish, and I never once got a refill on my drink. Next time I stay at the hotel, I will definitely be driving elsewhere to dine. There are so many other great places in Champaign, that it would be a shame to waste time and money here. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Service was good and food was delicious. Cocktail and martini menu had great options. Had martini flights on menu but no longer offer so that was bummer but besides that everything was great and had a good time with one of my best friends."}
{"text":"Finally went to Houlihan's last night after all these years of living in CU. I've been by this place hundreds of times, but never stopped by. Boy, was I missing out.

When we came we asked to sit outside and enjoyed the atmosphere. Plenty of seating, umbrellas over the tables, and plenty of foliage surrounding the patio area. Their beer selection left a lot to be desired, especially since it lacked lacked location brewery selections, but overall it wasn't too bad. 

We split the chipotle chicken nachos and loved them. There was more than enough for the two of us, and they were fantastic. We also split their fish tacos and were pleasantly surprised how good they were. As amateur connoisseurs of fish tacos, these hold up with some of the best we've had. So good.

All I can really say is that I'm a little sorry to have waited to long to check this place out. It's close to Memorial Stadium and the State Farm Center so it's ideal for both game day or post work drinks and appetizers. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is above board, lacking in ths selection dept. Unless you like chicken. Drinks are very well prepared. We will be back."}
{"text":"This review is more about the service than the food. Arrived here Sunday evening around 5:30 pm or so and requested a table for 3. The hostess advised us that it would be at least a 30min wait. We looked around and the restaurant was was almost empty. There was only 3 tables in the bar area in use not to mention only 4 tables in the actual restaurant used. When we questioned her she stated there were a bunch of reservations scheduled for 6pm. We ended up finding seats at the bar and just ate there. 

The girl at the bar was initially attentive but after getting us the first round of drinks and taking our order we actually had to flag her down for a second and third rounds. The other guy working the bar seemed to struggle with making drinks quickly and while he was there when she wasn't he never checked on us even though our glasses were empty. 

The girl bartender was the one that actually brought our salads out and not a food runner. After the meal was over we had noticed that all the tables supposedly waiting on guests who made reservations were still empty. When we asked her about it she said that on Sunday's they are short staffed and they didn't have any food runners. Perhaps if you are short staffed on Sunday's you should just close early or altogether instead of telling guests the place is booked and they can't be seated. 

Even the the food was great I doubt I would come back."}
{"text":"OK so if you are stranded at Station Square in Pittsburgh and can't get out, then Houlihan's is the best option.  Good food and reasonably priced plus the service is solid and they even have a 15-minutes-or-it's-free deal during lunch on the weekdays.

The soundtrack they play is even pretty good so if you need to eat and can't get outta the complex, take yourself to Houlihans!"}
{"text":"Think of this place like it's a fancy TGI Friday's, or Applebee's.

Standard American fare like burger's, steaks, and a decent selection of seafood."}
{"text":"I formerly was a regular customer at Houlihan's Tower City. However, my friends and I decided to stop hanging out there for 2 reasons. We asked the manager if he could stock Beck's Beer and he stated absolutely not, no way.  We found this incredulous because they were already selling Beck's Light, what is the problem with stocking Beck's? Second, there was a discrepancy with our check the final evening we spent there. We were charged for food we did not order and the server was very rude. The manager eventually adjusted the check, but the damage was done. There are far too many bars in the Downtown Cleveland area to worry about this place. In addition, I walked by Houlihan's several months ago and noticed that they have redecorated and the new bar seating is comprised of the old fashioned stools with no back support. Well, that really does it for this place. If you like slow service and rude managers, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Was just visiting Pittsburgh for the weekend seeing a friend and we decided to eat here after coming down from the incline. It was going to be our last meal before heading back to New York, so we were hoping for a good last meal, and it was a great choice! Located in the Station Square mall, it's easily accessible and looks pretty nice from the outside (and it's clean inside too).

The food is pretty traditional American fare, though the name kind of threw me off because I thought it was going to be an Irish restaurant. If you have FourSquare, DON'T FORGET TO CHECK IN because you get free fries with a check in! And it's not just the regular fries, you can get any of them (though I'm not sure about the poutine). We got the Truck Stop Fries (Chipotle Cheddar fries) and it was delicious! The fries were crunchy and savory and the toppings of cheese and scallions made it pretty enjoyable.

I saw the prices for the Long Island Iced Teas and was really confused. One glass for $5.95 and a liter pitcher for $6.65? WHAT? How can it be less than one dollar more to upgrade? I pulled over our waitress and asked about it because I thought it might have been a typo. She smiled and said it wasn't, so I asked her to recommend one of them for me. I wanted to get the Jack and... something one, but she said that the Georgia Peach was her favorite so I went for it. Didn't realize the drink was going to be so freaking pink though... I think maybe the entire drink had one/two shots in it and was pretty weak. It tasted really good though.

The rest of the food... to be honest, my chicken alfredo fettuccine was not impressive at all. I was disappointed by the arrangement of the chicken, which looked like they shoved it through a food grater and dropped it all on my plate with no aesthetic intentions at all. The pasta and sauce were also pretty bland and was nothing special. The sauce was somewhat watery and had no taste. It wasn't even cheesy, which is the worst thing alfredo sauce could do without just being terrible. My friend's sliders looked pretty good, though I'm not sure how they tasted. My other friend ordered the poutine, which seemed pretty standard though a bit lacking in the duck meat department. The large drink kind of just made my day. 

I think overall it was a pretty standard chain restaurant. The FourSquare deal, large drink, and calm atmosphere are what sold it for me. The mediocre food and weak alcohol content pulled away the star. I'd definitely be back, though I'll definitely avoid the pasta next time."}
{"text":"Houlihan's is attached to the I Hotel and offers the free continental breakfast offered with their standard hotel room stay. From reviews I had read I wasn't expecting much, and not having eaten the day before, being in a college town and it nearing the end of the buffet hours, my expectations were especially modest as a vegan patron. We were pleasantly surprised to be greeted by the manager, Nathaniel, who was attentive to our needs from the moment we arrived. I asked for a menu (still not expecting too much of the breakfast itself) and he directed us to the continental breakfast - an ample choice of breads (perhaps muffins?), spreads, toaster available, fresh fruit including a mix of fresh watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupe, oatmeal, cold cereals, warm breakfast wraps, fresh juice, soda fountain choices and Starbucks coffee. Nathaniel returned with my menu and I mentioned I was looking for some hash browns or potatoes not cooked in butter, and he suggested the roasted hash brown potatoes with onions. Perfect! A toasted bagel with peanut butter and banana, a bowl of fresh fruit, side of roasted hash browns with some juice - a lovely breakfast! The husband had a couple of the breakfast wraps and said they were quite tasty. Nathaniel continued to check on us and let us know when the buffet would be closing down. Though he kept just enough coffee to the side for those of us who needed to grab a cup to go.   One of the other things he did which was above and beyond was when I was telling him that everything was closed when we got in the night before and I couldn't cook the frozen burritos I had brought because I couldn't find a microwave he told me I could have asked the front desk to bring one up. Then he offered to have the front desk note my account so that the next time I'm at the hotel a microwave will be available for my room! Not many people seem to truly enjoy their jobs to the point where their good mood is infectious, but Nathaniel fits that bill. And the breakfast was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"$7 lunch special Monday thru Friday from 11-4pm?  I just started a new job at Wesco and I figured I'd try this out.  I ordered the fish sandwich, fries & an iced tea.  The fish was bigger than the bun, the bun was toasted but not overdone, the fries were nice & crispy to the last bite.  This is a great special, sure to not be around very long, but for a good lunch at a decent price- I'll be coming back here at least once a week...  :)"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my time here, I'm underage so I can't exactly review the bar or drinks, but the food is definitely something I'll talk about. Me and my mom were looking around Station Square after visiting a nearby school and we decided to stop on because the menu looked good. When we got in we were seated and had a very friendly waiter greet us and get our drinks (coke product). We decided to order the Prime Rib(4 oz.). That comes with the steak, fries or mashed potatoes, and your choice of vegetables. We asked for medium well steaks and I had the fries and green beans. He asked what soup we wanted as an appetizer and I got the Baked Potato Soup. The restaurant has a policy that parties of 6 or less will receive their food in 20 minutes guaranteed. The soup came in maybe 6-8 minutes and was absolutely very good, thick and creamy potato soup with chunks of baked potato, topped off with a good amount of bacon and cheese, 2 packs of crackers on the side. The Entree came in another 10-12 minutes and was clearly well made; absolutely delicious. The steak was perfectly cooked to my liking and so tender I could pull it apart with my fork, it came with a side sauce for dipping that I also enjoyed. The fries were thick but still crispy, and came with fresh ketchup on the side. The green Mon-Thu 11am-10pm (bar 12am) 
Fri-Sat 11am-11pm (bar 1am) 
Sun 11am-9pm (bar 11pm) was just amazing, and it was good portions for the price. I ended up being too full for dessert. Our meals came to $39 combined and the bill had the tip amounts for 15-22%, in which I tipped 20%. Overall a great experience and I will definitely be eating there again if I go to school there."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible management! We were told there was a 10 minute wait. 10 minutes was 1 hour. Why? The kitchen told the hostess not to seat tables because they couldn't keep up. There were 1/2 of the tables empty. I feel terrible for the hostess and wait staff. This manager should be fired."}
{"text":"I give it a solid three. Maybe even 3.5. Did not experience any of the negatives stated previously. Sure it is a chain and in a mall, but food and service was good, 

I had Chicken Parmesan. The mix of Alfredo and Marinara made it unique as well as yummy. Portion size was large. I was stuff after. 

Nothing fancy or special and much more deserving than the current rating. Don't be scared of here.  A respectable place to eat."}
{"text":"Decided to do Happy Hour here,  they had some new drinks on the menu. The server said at 5:00 pm, they were still setting up the bar, and she didn't know the drink that it would be a while. It was at least 20 minutes. It was the Oak something drink.it was good but it should've been free I drank a whole glass of water before it came. Food was good but considering Happy Hour is 3-6, and the outdoor bar was pretty filled with people,  they should know what's on the menus."}
{"text":"We went here for my sister's birthday. It took 1 hour for the food to come out. We got our entrees then our appetizers and salads. What a joke! Our server never checked on us at all during our hour wait. My sides were cold, so I assume they sat for quite some time. This is the worst place I've ever been to, and I won't be back! Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I seem to choose Houlihan's often for our dinner and a movie date nights. The price is decent and the food has never disappointed us. The margarita flatbread, white bean and artichoke hummus, chicken Parmesan sandwich, stuffed chicken breast, and the filet mignon have all been fabulous dishes. The service is sometimes a little slow, but nothing that's too irritating. We obviously keep going back!"}
{"text":"This is delicious! I had never been to a Houlihans before and it is great. At lunch I get the mini burgers and salad combo and it is great- a little pricey. If it was $7.95 or so I think that it would be a better deal but the food is really good. At dinner time they have a menu that included mac and cheese for $6 and it is GREAT!!!! This is a place worth going!!"}
{"text":"I don't come here often because it's pricey and you have to pay to park, but I ADORE the stuffed chicken breast meal. I've never had anything here that I didn't like - even the freshly brewed iced tea is delicious. Just wish their prices were a bit better."}
{"text":"I will be super blunt here. These guys are complete idiots. Ok. Garth Brooks on a Saturday night. Hmm. Lets schedule no servers and no bartenders and let's see what happens when the 7:30 concert gets out. I guess this is the norm for this area. Too many people that have no clue what is going on. If this were in Atlanta, this place would be closed down. This place is quite the joke. So next time fellas, either close or staff up. Geez"}
{"text":"Waiter was very contradicting and seemed confused. Food was at best average for the prices."}
{"text":"We got seated immediately, and our server was friendly & efficient.  I got the So. Cal Fish Tacos, which were fabulous.  Houlihans is an occasional fave in our hometown and this location did nothing to discourage a prompt return.  The Creme' Brûlée, served with sweet fresh Blackberries, was a large portion and absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"Our server was extremely inattentive to our table's time and needs. My table felt our 2 hour meal for 2 of the 4 ordering was a bit excessive. Upon asking for a GF menu out of need and not preference I was served a drink containing gluten (yes, I had to find out the hard way). Boo on service."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 15 (we had a reservation). They were completely unprepared for us. We arrived at 7 and they first tried to seat us at a table for 8. They then moved us to the bar area and sat us on 4 different round high top tables. Whatever, we can make that work.

We all ordered our drinks and it took over 20 minutes for them to all be delivered. Mind you, many of us just ordered water to start with as we were going to be going out afterwards. 20 minutes is just insane to wait for water!

Another 20 minutes goes by and our waiter (who's name I never caught) FINALLY came to take our orders. We knew it would take awhile for our food so we all sat and chatted. Food finally started coming out and as it came out he had no idea who ordered what, so we had to figure out what was on the plate and who ordered it. My food was alright, though at first it didn't come with the potato's that I ordered. Instead of just bringing me a side, he took my entire plate back and came back with mashed potato's very haphazardly placed on the side.

One of our diners didn't get their food until almost everyone had already eaten. She ordered chicken tenders...they aren't that difficult to make!

So up until this point we were all a bit peeved but could deal with it.

The real disaster hit when he went to give us our tickets. Out of 15 checks, only 2 of them were right. He charged a pregnant lady 2 alcoholic beverages! It's not like he just gave her the wrong ticket, she was the only one that ordered what she got! So he just had no idea who ordered what.

I got my check and it had an iced tea on it that I didn't order. He took my check to take it off and I didn't get a new check for another 30 minutes. I almost walked out without paying because we were getting tired of waiting, but I'm an honest person and I wouldn't have felt right leaving without paying.

FINALLY the manager came out to assist him. Why wasn't she there the entire time? I have no idea! But she was about as much help as a log. She apologized, of course. But did we get any sort of compensation? Nope. She did decide to send the person that the party was in honor of a gift card to come back. Something tells me that gift card will go unused. I know I will never return to this establishment.

Why was that poor waiter left on his own with a party of 15? Why didn't ANYONE help him? I saw at least 3 or 4 waiters pass by our table and not a single one of them thought that maybe he was struggling. Now, don't get me wrong...our waiter was about as personable as a stick in the mud, but still...we couldn't help but feel sorry for him, he obviously had no support from management.

Get it together, Houlihan's. If you can't handle a 15 top, don't allow them. I doubt ANY of us will ever return to your establishment. And you really put a damper on what was supposed to be a really awesome night for our bride-to-be."}
{"text":"Love it here!

Don't let the bad reviews deter you!  I always get the French dip and my wife always tries something different and we are never disappointed. 

The lettuce wraps are the best you can get."}
{"text":"Id never been to Houliahan's before but after visiting Id like for them to change their name from Houlihan's to HoTGIApp (that's Houlihans + TGI Friday's + Applebee's, for the uninitiated.)  If you love these kinds of places, you'll love Houlihan's.  If you hate them, like I do, then you'll do like me and just grin and bear it while you're there.  Nothing interesting or exciting going on here.  Just mass produced food that's tied to some kind of weird theme that no one understands."}
{"text":"Went to Houlihans for the Happy Hour tonight.  So disappointing! $5 appetizers are scant portions that are a complete joke.  This is truly the worst happy hour I have ever been at.  No wonder this bar is empty and Bar Louie  a few doors down is rocking.  Never going back."}
{"text":"I am definitely not new to ordering Uber eats and I just had to mention that both times that I've ordered from here the food has came hot wrapped up and neatly put together and delicious every time"}
{"text":"After I offered a bunch of fun downtown options of bars/restaurants to go for happy hour before a concert at the Q, somehow it was decided that Houlihan's would be it. I didn't realize that it's just a chain, and a boring one at that. The food was just ok. The service was just ok. Oh, and they have NO HAPPY HOUR! WTH? How does a place not have happy hour and even compete downtown?

They were offering  half off bottles of wine, which is a good deal, and I guess they do every Tuesday, but the wine selection is nothing special, so it wasn't that exciting. Everything else was full price. I don't get it. I don't get why we went there. I don't get what place it has in Cleveland's culinary advancement. 

And the much touted stuffed mushrooms were crunchy coated, fried, with little wet lumps of mushrooms inside. I'm about to talk myself into 1 star. 
Our bill for wine, 3 appetizers and 2 light beers was $60 plus tip. Did I mention that was during HAPPY HOUR!!!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've order from here... Spending basically $21 for dinner I said well done over the phone that's most definitely medium well & not well done. What was the purpose of asking in the first place? No pork for anything, lets guess what's in my salad bacon crumbles . Now I am truly done with this establishment! 
Okay because it's the only place I can order to meet my diet requirements I tried again I said very well done & it's not well done I said no pink it's still fucking pink clearly they need a new cook!"}
{"text":"Flat bread pizza was pretty good.  Clean restaurant and the staff is very attentive. Not much of chain restaurant person but I don't mind dining here. It's always nice to come down to Station Square and get a change of scenery."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Surprisingly tasty and consistent food. Service has always been adequate. I always come here with my aunt and cousins for drinks and dinner when I am in town. We have a fun time and the staff is alright with us hanging out at our table for a while without ordering more. 

My biggest peeve with this place is the prices. It is WAY too expensive for what it is (which is basically an upcharged TGI Fridays). My aunt's martinis were $17 or $18 each. My well grade vodka sodas were $8.50 each, and my cousin's vodka soda with mint and lime they decided to call a \"mojito\" and charge $13.50 each. My aunt ordered the small plate of scallops, which contained 2 scallops and it was $17, for 2 scallops and the white bean salad.

Seriously, this is Strongsville, OH not the Las Vegas Strip!"}
{"text":"Watered down cocktails
Side salad portion a joke
Service sub par
Ever since under new corporate management a real rip off"}
{"text":"Such a nice relaxed atmosphere. Always get the almond crusted tilapia and it never dissapoints. My husband got the 9 oz. sirloin and liked it particularly because he ordered it medium and was cooked to perfection. Dessert was apple pie and the smores crock- so good! It is a little pricier than I think its worth though not outrageous. Service has always been attentive and not bothersome. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience, nor a bad meal here, I'm just not a big fan of chain restaurants.  This location is fairly close to where I work, and therefore is usually the site for celebratory lunches.   I most recently dine here on a Friday afternoon.  My favorite meal here is the Asian Chicken Chop Chop salad.  The portion is HUGE and price is sufficient ($11).  The salad consists of assorted greens, scallions, grilled/marinated chicken, jicama, and wonton strips.  The salad is topped with peanuts and tossed with a sesame dressing.   Chopsticks are provided with the meal.  This is a VERY good salad.  I've had the fish tacos here in the past, as well as burgers, and a number of other selections including the the traditional baked potato soup, which is always good.   The service is ALWAYS on point.   I will continue to return to Houlihans."}
{"text":"Unacceptable service. One of our party's entrees was not made to specification, and it took 5 minutes to flag down a server and inform them of this. Then, the corrected entree did not arrive for another 20 minutes. During this time our server (or a manager) was nowhere to be seen, despite the restaurant being half empty. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"The tuscan white bean salad was PHENOMENAL! I like this so much I am going to atempt to make it at home. Beautifully plated. Also has the wild mushroom enchiladas which were good, but not special. They have a fifteen minute guarantee on your food arriving from the time the order is placed, so it would be a great choice for a lunch break. Also, very nice wait staff."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience at this location. We have had the same server each time we have visited (not sure the odds of that) and he is absolutely awesome. I don't recall his name, but he has been here for a while & is just great- fills your water constantly, super knowledgeable and really friendly.

The food is always great too. It's a chain, so don't expect it to be a 5-star meal, but honestly we have never been disappointed. My boyfriend always gets their brentwood chicken sandwich and their side salad, which honestly is one of the best house salads around. Their ranch is so unique and really flavorful. I try different items each time I visit and most recently had a house salad and the Firecracker shrimp appetizer, which was really tasty.

Their drinks are tasty as well. I have visited for happy hour a few times and always enjoyed my cocktail or beer.

I would be a little weary about coming here on the weekends, as I am sure it gets really packed. However, on a weekday it's quite calm."}
{"text":"A group of about 15 of us went here for a friend's birthday. The staff was super friendly, attentive, and accomodating. They were quick with the drinks, everyone's checks were correct, and they didn't mind us getting rather rowdy/drunk. We will certainly be back for happy hours in the future."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a disaster. It made me question my life for half an hour: do you guys have to pay for salts here in the States? I have never had so many salts in my entire 22 years life. Worst restaurant I have ever had."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner last night. Seared ahi tuna and calamari for apps, scallops and stuffed chicken for dinner. The food was very good. I expected to wait much longer than we did for food since the campus was flooded with marathon runners. In and out in about an hour. 
My only complaint is with the service. Our waiter looked like he had just rolled out of bed and was annoyed he had to work. By the end of the meal we were finally able to get one smile out of him. 
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here on numerous occasions. At least 6 times. It's a convenient location and I always think my bad experiences are a fluke. I've come for brunch once, that was a bust. My other visits are during dinner. Of all the dishes I've tried, the worst was the veggie burger. Cold white rice with a few black beans thrown in and shaped into a patty.

I'd prefer a bowl of cereal at home over this place. Hands down."}
{"text":"I hate writing these kind of reviews, because I always try to find the positive in restaurant experiences having worked in the service and restaurant industry as a Server/Bartender for 10+ years.  I know the nuances of restaurants, and how seemingly innocuous things spiral into, or are exhibits of a larger problem or lack of training. 

This was the case yesterday. I was seated promptly, though the girl at the Hostess stand could have gave two shits as I walked passed her without a word or a smile. Too busy texting. Oh well.

Found my way to the patio where I was seated by a young chap, forget his name, but he looked no older than 16. Nice kid. Until he started crushing some snacks while walking around to tables.

I get it - you work in a restaurant - You're constantly surrounded by food you're not allowed to eat, that you in fact for hours on end, have to give to other people so they can eat. In my experience there are certain non-negotiables in the industry and that includes eating food in front of guests, carrying and eating food in front of guests, and drinking drinks in plain-view of guests.

This guy was seemingly more interested that his group of teen-somethings had come to hang out at his new establishment and forgot some basic restaurant etiquette. This is actually a good teaching point for the Manager should he read this.

If you want to work, work. If you want to hang out with your friends, great. But it's somewhat hard to do both when you're busy. We all make mistakes. I once got fired from a place because my manager told me I could have a drink at the bar after my shift on my birthday, and the owner came in and fired me on the spot. Things happen. 

It looks really bad when an employee is walking around to tables eating food that I hope wasn't from a guests plate, but it bothered me enough that I couldn't stop wondering what else went on here. This guy also was  walking around with a styrofoam cup drinking from it frequently visiting his friends, at one point sitting down with them. Maybe they gave him the snack. It was just awkward. Keep employee food and drinks out of sight of dining customers."}
{"text":"I had breakfast with my guest who stayed at the I hotel. The food was ok; the baked potato and bacon were both slightly overcooked and dried. The ultimate bad experience came from the waitress. She is in her mid-age and was super in a hurry for everything. She spilled coffee, forgot the tobasco, dropped the plate, etc. Most terrible thing is that, my guest does not eat pork due to his religion. We specifically told her twice that \"no bacon\". Guess what, it came with a load of bacon. Maybe it is the cook who forgot about it, but she did not notice it either. It was not a plasant experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Houlihan's while shopping at South Park Mall, and am glad I did. We started with the chipotle chicken nachos, which were excellent.  My girlfriend ordered the black Angus burger and loved it. Large burger cooked just how she wanted it. I chose the seared scallops with lemon-asparagus risotto, baby spinach and basil infused olive oil. This was one of the best dishes I've ever had, without a doubt the best meal at a chain restaurant. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the olive oil perfectly complemented the risotto. Our server, Cassandra, was fantastic. Total pro. Attentive and knowledgeable, but not overbearing. Overall, an awesome experience. Can't wait to go back. My sister recommended the fish tacos highly, so maybe I'll try them also."}
{"text":"Deserves essentially the same score as TGI Fridays because they are essentially they same, with Fridays edging maybe slightly ahead

Yes, compared to the neighboring areas, this place is on the boring side, but as for quality, consistency, and value, it is fair, especially the pitcher of long islander!

If you are craving seafood, I recommend the Almond Crusted Tilapia or Fish Tacos
If you are hungry, don't worry, Houlihan's will fill you up (portions are on the large side)

I don't recommend the steak unless you are really craving it. Underwhelming, arrived room temperature, boring, with synonymous side dishes

Overall, I probably wouldn't come back unless all the more exciting downtown offers are fully booked.."}

{"text":"Awful experience from beginning to end. Hostess seemed bothered, waitress detached & indifferent, Blue Moon on tap but \"oh sorry,sold out\", double charged for other drinks, waited 40 minutes for subpar food & extremely small portions, left hungry & disappointed. With all the restaurants in the Strongsville area, do yourself a favor & go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"A big group of us came to houlihans tonight to celebrate some birthdays. We started off at tap house but it was way too crowded. There was a group that sat at the bar, and a group that sat at the round table in the corner. Our table had about 9 people. 

We got there at nine and the server promptly told us that they were closing at ten. We ordered drinks almost right away, and tried to order apps but holly said that she was \"only taking drink orders.\" I guess she thought better of it because she took the appetizer order. I tried to tell her at the beginning we were on separate checks but she said she'd deal with that later. Our drinks took forever, and the apps came out in Bits and pieces. Finally my friend that ordered nachos asked where they were and holly said they burnt them. So we ordered and again our food came out in pieces. The birthday girl got tired of waiting for a drink so she went to the bar to get one and then had to wait forever to pay for it! Our table was disgusting the entire time, was never cleared of excess plates until it was time for holly to come pick up the signed credit card receipts. Every time we asked for something we were reminded that they were closing and given an eye roll. One friend swore the spinach dip was spoiled (it wasn't, it was just different than what she was used to) and asked what kind of cheese/cream and the answer was, \"I'm not going to lie, I have no idea.\"

The food was stupidly priced. This is not a gourmet restaurant. This is a bar restaurant. With $10 apps and $18 entrees, you'd expect A LOT more from the food. That coupled with the experience of being hit up for money and a meal from a bum did not make me happy!

What's worse is I left a less than great tip. Being a former server I have a LOT of patience, but don't rush a party out the door who's table alone spent at least $400! Especially when we are all tipped employees and tip extra big for great service! I've never left a bad tip. 

And then Holly cried about it to the rest of the table! How tacky! You had other people in the restaurant. If you would have just treated us with respect I would have tipped way over the top. 

If this was just my first bad experience I'd let it slide. Everybody has a bad night. But I went in about six weeks ago with one other person and sat at the bar. Our server/bartender was so engrossed with the other guy at the end of the bar we couldn't even get drink refills! 

So for my $52 I could have gone somewhere else, got better food and service, and been a lot happier. For being a prime spot in downtown Cleveland you'd better step it up!"}
{"text":"Chains like Houlihan's have their place.  They're generally reliable, no surprises, and they're good \"go-to\" places if you're meeting up with friends.  Such was the case when I was out with a couple of friends the other night.

After forgoing appetizers for some soup, my friend Lisa settled on the Brentwood Chicken sandwich (could it be because she once lived in Brentwood), while my friend Maryann went for the salmon.  I opted for the pot roast, which I had to admit was pretty good.

This Houlihan's has been here for many years--ever since I was a kid.  I'd give it 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Some of the worst food I've ever had in a restaurant. Absolutely horrible. The burger I got was dry and flavorless, and the side dishes tasted like cafeteria food. My wife got the fish tacos and I swear they mush have caught the fish in the Monongahela. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"While there was nothing terrible about it, it basically struck me as a local version of Applebee's or something like that. Let's just throw some stupid decorations on the wall and serve up some okay-ish food with friendly servers. It just isn't nice at all. I could get some much better food for if not the same price, only slightly more, a price I would gladly pay.

Not a fan. Won't be going back unless I'm at Tower City and the group all wants to go there."}
{"text":"Service was great and manager was present interacting with the guests but the food was horrible. This was our first visit to Pittsburgh and had high expectations but the food just killed it... it had a great atmosphere and looked like an upper scale dining establishment. The prices defiantly reflect this. Not somewhere we would visit again."}
{"text":"This is a nice family restaurant it's also good for couples or if you were single and want to late lunch... Good sitting by the indoor bar and wonderful sitting on the outdoor patio. The staff is friendly and as attentive of those you want them to be. I've been here twice over a year apart actually three times twice for lunch and once for dinner and it's always been good."}
{"text":"An okay place to go if you are looking for a cheaper place to eat in Station Square.  The food is decent and they have a large variety of liquor at the bar."}
{"text":"Lunch portion \"scallop\" dish was a bowl of risotto with diver scallop garnish. I love balsamic reduction but the amount on this dish was overpowering. Risotto needed salt. Ceasar salad was delicious, but that's hard to really mess up...wish they used shaved parmesan as opposed to the powder stuff from a plastic container. 3 stars for friendly and fast service. Would not return for the food."}
{"text":"Oh, Houlihan's. I try SO hard to like you. I really do. I've always had good experiences at Houlihan's in other towns, so I was excited that Champaign was not only getting one, but that it would actually be located on the south side of town near my home instead of the urban blight that is North Prospect. 

But sadly, my experiences there have been haphazard at best. One time the food will be good and the service atrocious. Then the next, the service will be friendly (if not terribly professional or well-trained) and the food will just be downright BAD. 

I had a really exceptionally good lunch experience about a month ago--best server I've had in any Champaign restaurant in a LONG time--and the food was really good that day, too. (I'm sure this young lady would not take a plate out of the kitchen if it didn't meet her exacting standards, so I give her partial credit there, too). But then a couple of weeks later I stopped in with my son for lunch on a Sunday and had a pretty bad time of it. (The lettuce in my salad had been frozen and was limp. The iced tea had that 'old' oxidized taste. Blech. His burger was cooked to the consistency of a doorstop.). So sad. 

Consistency is what gains a restaurant success. And the chef and the front of house manager BOTH need to have incredible expectations and hold their people to that EVERY SINGLE DAY.  Furthermore, they need to train, train, train, and train so their people know what those expectations are and how they can meet them and exceed them. 

I'll keep going back, of course. I want this place to succeed. I want it to represent Champaign-Urbana to all the people who stay in the hotel or attend a conference or cheer on the Illini at a game. I have hope, because there is SO much potential. Houlihan's has all the ingredients to make a great, fun restaurant. They just need to have the right people putting together the recipe."}
{"text":"Houlihan's is probably my favorite restaurant in Station Square for lunch.

The power greens salad with chicken blows my mind!  Its seriously the only time I like kale, and trust me, I've tried all the Pinterest recipies!

They've got an excellent lunch menu.  I haven't been there for dinner so I haven't had any of the entrees.  I do know that the food here is consistently good, and so is the service.  And its QUICK.  

Houlihan's is not the cheapest restaurant for lunch, but it's a go to on pay day when I feel like spending money.  The salad and a drink end up being $17.00.  You also get a really good cookie with your bill.

Also, try the tortilla soup, because it is DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Whomever is in charge of this place should be fired. Not only was staff walking out in droves, we paid and never received our food. Absolutely horrible experience."}
{"text":"Surprisingly tasty Thai Chicken with asparagus.  I recommend substituting the rice because it was too bland to warrant the carbs."}
{"text":"Houlihans constantly underwhelms me... and by constantly, I mean the two times I've gone there.  I think that for the quality/taste of food, it's way over priced.  I have had the SW chicken wrap, which mentions jalepenos, but I found it incredibly bland.  My dad liked his sandwich... but it was like ham and cheese with mixed greens, it's not that hard.

The decor is cool, I just think the prices are a little bit ridiculous for the quality of food in Champaign."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I so badly want to go into a long rant, but I'm going to leave it short & simple. Hostess was straight off the Hot Mess Express and couldn't figure out how to seat people. Didn't get menus when we were sat, so I had to go get them off the host stand myself. Server didn't come to get our drink orders for 15 minutes! Food wasn't great. Lobby & bathrooms filthy. 

Don't waste your time trying to eat here. There are better places to go."}
{"text":"We ate the club and chicken sandwich. They were both pretty good. All the wait staff are dressed very professionally which was nice to see. Our server was attentive and polite. All in all a good dinner."}
{"text":"Ah, who doesn't love a cliche Valentine's Day prix fixe menu? 

Publicly? Not many.
Privately? Everyone. 

Naturally, I'm included. I love it. I want to try everything for the best price!

Anyway, my date and I came in on Saturday and were super intrigued by the Valentine's menu. 

We got the guacamole for an appetizer and it was fantastic. I've had a lot of different kinds of guac but the pomegranate seeds were a great touch. Touché. Oh god, plus the cojita cheese..unf! delish.

We both got salads and they were great. Fresh, tasty, etc. 

It only sort of starts to fall apart here, but not catastrophically. The steak was very, very not good. Super dry, too well done, was very hard to cut and didn't really taste like anything.The stuffed chicken, however, was on point, as well as all the sides (brown rice, baked potato, mashed potatoes and green beans).

The bag of donuts was an incredible way to end this experience. They were so chocolatey, warm and gooey! 

I really am not a fan of tourist traps or chain restaurants but Houlihan's is A-OK in my book. They definitely have a lot worth trying."}
{"text":"I like Houlihan's. They have a good french dip $12.95 and you can get green beans as your side at no extra charge, I dig the flexibility. A lot of places make you pay more if you want a healthier side than french fries. But if you are craving fried potatoes, go with their parmesan frites $5.95 which come with three different dipping sauces. Now the chicken avocado eggrolls $9.25 are good, but mine weren't cooked long enough or maybe the roll wasn't thick enough because the outside was soft and fragile, not crispy. I'd recommend against getting their loaded potato soup $3.50 as it was pretty meh and I didn't even finish it. The queso dip $6.95 though? Get that. It comes with tortilla chips AND potato skins! 

The crowd does seem a bit older here so I have always gotten my food to-go, the problem with that though is they seem to have an issue with charging tax. The tax law for Ohio is that food purchased for consumption off premises where sold is tax free. So make sure you double check your bill and have them remove the tax if they put it on there. 

My other issue would be that they sell creme brulee but you can't get it to-go unless you want them to scoop up your dessert in chunks and plop it into another container. Why not just purchase some aluminum to-go containers and make the dessert in that so you don't have use a traditional ramekin? 

Overall, not bad prices and the food is mostly satisfying."}
{"text":"I've been to Houlihan's in other cities, but was sorely disappointed in the Station Square chain.  We waited a solid 20 minutes for someone to take our drink order once we were seated.  Wait staff walked by us several times.  Finally I asked someone to help us.  When we put in our food order (appetizers only) it also seemed to take forever.  I had to get up and ask the hostess to find us some place settings so we could eat, and that took forever as well.  The food was nothing special.  If they are busy, skip this place."}
{"text":"i've had decent food and service a few times, but it's honestly iffy on the food, so i stopped going for a little while.

i went one night recently with some friends for late night drinks & food on the patio. the food wasnt th the best and had little effort put into it. I ordered the southwest grill wrap, however it wasn't even wrapped! i went to take a bite and half of it fell out.. as if it should've been called a soft taco, not a wrap.

also, i understand it was late night, but the fries were just terrible because of the old old grease. i ate about 3, then handed them over to my s/o without saying my opinion who later agreed they tasted terrible. They were grease sogged + luke warm as if sitting around waiting for us to order them. the worst concoction for a french fry. 

i know none of these reasons are horrifying, but i'm not going to waste time and cross my fingers that my food is good.  There are too many places to eat in the robinson area for the exact same price and I bet your food is atleast hot!"}
{"text":"I have visited other Houlihan's and not liked them. I did enjoy this location, though. Even my many coworkers commented on how much they enjoyed the taste of the food. I appreciated how our large group was seated during a busy lunch time and how the staff rushed the service so that we could all catch our flights at the airport. Price was moderate."}
{"text":"Many issues with this location. 

Appetizers:
 Edamame - good
 Calamari - undercooked breading and a lot of it
 Wings - funky (not good funky) sauce but meaty wings
     Lots of vinegar

Main:
 Fish tacos - happy with entree
 Burger ($$) - cooked properly but strange taste and
     Mashed potatoes strange
 Steak ($$) - steak little dry but cooked correctly. 
     Same mashed issues. 4 sticks of asparagus only
 Margherita pizza - painfully dry and light on flavor

For the price, I expect much more consistency. Hoping a bad night!!!!!"}
{"text":"Houlihans is ok. Not as good as when it was at parmatown. This one has no character. No warmth, no ambiance. Food is good but it'll never be what it once was. Very sad!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located near offices, this is a nice place to go to meet people for a drink or for their happy hour specials. Happy hour consists of drink specials & small plates for $3.95. Today, I had an Angus slider with fries. Aside from that, the menu offers various entrées, salads, appetisers which they call apps, sandwiches which they call handhelds. There's a decent drinks menu. I've tried a number of their martinis ($4.95 on Thursdays) with the guavatini being my favourite. There's a short list of desserts as well. I had the cappuccino cake ($6.95), which was ok & gave me my sugar fix. While the food & service isn't outer worldly, it is a convenient place. When the weather is nice, the outdoor seating is great. (Bonus: Tesla charging stations at the iHotel.)"}
{"text":"Why is Laura M., PGH's intrepid reviewer of hidden gem, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, reviewing a chain casual dining restaurant like Houlihan's?  Well, like many people, I ended up at Houlihan's at the behest of a friend (who I hadn't seen for months) for her birthday, along with a large group. (Said friend received a $15 off coupon for her birthday, hence her incentive to come.)  Quite frankly, I came for the company, with low expectations for the food, and those expectations were met.

As soon as we walked in, I noticed a strange, slightly unpleasant smell that I couldn't quite put my finger on, which I later determined to be emanating from the restroom.  We stood at the hostess stand for several minutes before someone acknowledged us, and then we waited several more minutes while she put some tables together, during which time we were awkwardly greeted by another hostess. When we were finally seated, we inquired about the happy hour, and our waitress told us that we had to go to the bar to purchase drinks and apps at the happy hour price.  So, we awkwardly got up a few at a time to get our drinks, and ended up getting regular apps.  Per the bartender's recommendation, I got the raspberry long island iced tea ($5.75, HH price), which I thought was a glass, but turned out the be a liter.  Though I've never had a long island before and don't have any standard of judgment, it was cloyingly sweet and wasn't strong at all, since I didn't feel tipsy in the slightest even after drinking the entire liter.  I tried several different variants ordered by my friends, and they were all very sweet and not very strong--the only drink I thought had a better balance was the angry orchard cocktail.

For food, we ordered several appetizers to share between us: parmesan frites, \"shrooms,\" and pretzel sticks.  They were all predictably mediocre and salty, with little depth of flavor.  In particular, I was not a fan of the bier cheese, which had a strange aftertaste, or the horseradish sauce incorporated into the shrooms.  For my entree, I ordered the quiche Lorraine with a cup of potato soup, which came with it ($11.95).  To my surprise, the potato soup wasn't salty--if anything, it was bland and underseasoned, such that I added some salt and pepper to spice it up.  The quiche was okay, but nothing very special--I'd definitely had much better renditions elsewhere.  I felt that the amount of food that I received for the price was lacking.  Several other members of our group ordered flatbreads, including my friend who sat next to me, who ordered the gluten free version.  Her flatbread was served at room temperature, such that she sent it back to the kitchen to be warmed up.  To their credit, the kitchen remade it and the manager comped it--but at the end of the day, this shouldn't have happened in the first place.

Needless to say, I was less than impressed with the quality of food and drinks that I received from Houlihan's, especially given the price (total check: around $20 w/ tip), not to mention that you have to pay for parking (you're looking at around $5 for a couple of hours).  I'd never been to a Houlihan's before, and to be honest, I doubt I'd return.  There are many restaurants with more character and better--and less expensive--drinks and bar food not far away on East Carson St., including Piper's Pub, Fat Heads, and the Smiling Moose, to name just a few.  Experiences like this are why I always try to talk my friends (and boyfriend!) into trying somewhere new, and avoiding chain casual dining whenever possible, esp. given the richness of the dining scene in PGH.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"If you get food poisoning do you rate the restaurant with 1 star or no stars. I ordered the pot roast and it was fatty and generally pretty disgusting. I was hungry so I ate a little bit of it anyway. Big mistake. I ended up with food poisoning that seemed like it might kill me. I called to tell them about it and get an apology. They were indifferent and said tough luck. I would never order any food here and they were not very nice either."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the food I've gotten here and the service is usually good too. It's not 5 star service or 5-star food but all around a decent place for dinner."}
{"text":"Was here for a wedding rehearsal dinner, service was quick and efficient. The private room was beautiful and far away enough from the main restaurant to not be disturbed. I had salmon, the stuffed chicken also looked wonderful."}
{"text":"This place one of my favorites in town. Good service, great environment and awesome food. Their fish tacos are absolutely delicious and you can't go wrong with them, but the steaks, burgers, grilled stuff is delectable too. Most appetizers are shareable which is great if you're going as a group. Portions are good sized and very filling but if you go for dessert they have this Serious Brownie Sundae which is absolute perfection."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain, and for me that instantly drops it down a few notches. But, that being said, we just rolled in there after shopping. We ordered a few appetizers; spinach dip, flatbread pizza and goat cheese poppers. The quality of the flatbread was ok (kind of cracker-like) and the bread crisps that came with the spinach dip seemed to be about the same. That was the bad part. The good part was that it ALL tasted pretty darn good. So, if you happen to be close, it is definitely worth running in."}
{"text":"Went out tonight specifically looking for a place with a patio. This location has one, but be advised: there are no umbrellas or shade of any kind. We ended up dining inside because sitting in direct sunlight on a hot & humid day was not going to happen. Our food, service, and drinks were good though."}
{"text":"Long wait. Ahí tuna appetizer, delicious. 
The $26-6oz filet minion was the size of my fork and definitely not worth the $$$"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 12 and they sat us at a table for 8. Instead of moving us they added chairs too the table and squished us at the ends. The service was awful. They kept telling us that the service and table issues were because they were so busy. The restaurant was about 1/4 full. It took an eternity to get my sunny side up eggs and they were completely raw. The table next to me had the same issue and set it back. It took so long for it to come back that I didn't even bother sending mine back. I gave them 1 star because I asked for crispy bacon and they did 1 thing right."}
{"text":"Went for a work meeting they have a great room off of main dining area which is good for parties with doors that close to make it private.  Food is so so I ordered the salmon BLT with homemade salsa and chips and French onion soup. I wish I could review the soup but i never received it. The BLT came out with the pineapple rice instead not the chips. To rectify The waitress immediately brought out chips and salsa. The salsa did not taste house made I would not have been able to tell the difference from a store bought jar of salsa. The salmon BLT was good but not as good as I expected from the description. If it wasn't for the bacon there would not have been much flavor  over all I would say it was a little better than the typical bar food but thought is was over priced for what you receive . You are paying for the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"I stopped here with coworkers for lunch.  The food was just okay.  I would describe the the food as a highend Friday's."}
{"text":"Usually I am not a fan of chain restaurants, but when your traveling, sometimes it is just easier. I stopped in for a late dinner and the food was good. Nothing spectacular and based on the food alone I would give it three stars. What was really great though was the bartender. For the life of me, I can't remember his name, sorry! We got to chatting, because I was traveling home to the NYC area, and he used to live in NYC, but is originally from Cleveland. Super interesting guy and gave me a ton of information about things to do, places to see and even some Cleveland history. Great bartender and because of his tips I left as they were getting ready to close and had a fun night in Cleveland. I will stop back next time I am passing through the area."}
{"text":"Came here for a conference and got to enjoy the reception here at the on site restaurant. Great wings, pizza, spinach dip, and fried mushrooms. Also great service  at the bar! The bar tenders were extremely accommodating and found chargers for my friend and I (with different phones) after ours had died.

I would say 5 for service, and 3 for food."}
{"text":"Gross.  Fiance ordered a beer and was given a can and a frozen glass.  The glass was a nice touch but when he poured the beer, black flecks of mold were in the head.  The top of the can was slimy and had mold all over it.  The nacho appetizer came out and the guac was brown and fruit flies soon began to swarm, which makes me think that food is being left out in the kitchen.  The steak was dry and hard to chew.  I think the highlight was my pumpkin creme brulee for just $5 and my toddler's kraft macaroni meal.  They did comp that moldy beer and service was okay for a large party but one person at our table sat without a water refill for more than 30 minutes.  I was lucky enough to be seated near my dad who is always sure to get the attention of his server."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to grab bite to eat.  Food is not fantastic, but it was very goo for the price you pay.  It's attached to the Station Square shopping mall - that gave us something to do while we waited for our table - plus they send you a text when your table is ready, so there is no worrying about being out if range."}
{"text":"I live on Mt. Washington, so this place is convenient via incline to try something other than Redbeard's.  The happy hour specials are decent and the app's are tasty and diverse.  
My biggest complaint are the wait staff both in the bar area and the dining area.  They are just not attentive.  If you get to the happy hour at 6 and expect to have two drinks, guess again.  They will take your drink order at 6:15, meal order at 6:30, deliver your drinks at 6:20 and return with your food only in time for 7:05 to see if you need a refill.  Ask before the specials end.
Otherwise, this is a nice change of pace.  From my prior review, the drinks are still pricey"}
{"text":"I love Houlihans, and I am there once or twice a week. Food is high quality and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Have been visiting this place for 20 years. Have never been disappointed.  On this trip we ordered the mushroom appetizer which is awesome and has been for years.  I had heartland chicken salad and it is always awesome.  My kids live the handmade chicken tenders there are big tasty and fries always good.  Coffee great   everything all good very good. If u had a bad experience u must have been responsible."}
{"text":"I'll tell you the only reason that this restaurant is getting four stars is for the service that I received from Susie as well as the quality of food and drink that we had when we decided to come back to sit at the bar .
 I was meeting a coworker after work she was running about 30 minutes late I grab us a table and started to do some paperwork.  I was approached by a male server who asked if I would like something to drink.  I asked if they had herbal tea with caffeine he said he was unsure. I asked him to check and he just looked at me.  So I asked if they had cappuccino...  he looked at me and said \"This isn't Starbucks\" he did not appear to be joking or crack a smile. I responded \"Nevermind I'll just have coffee thank you\". 
 30 minutes later I get a text that my coworker is there and I realize he never brought my coffee. I packed my things and left. We had a snack elsewhere and returned to eat and drink for happy hour and sat the bar.  As previously stated the quality of the food drink and Susie the bartender rectified my initial situation.  Thank you Susie for your amazing customer service."}
{"text":"For lunch, the waiter said I could have a dinner portion instead of having soup or a salad. When I got the bill, I was charged the dinner price, which was almost twice as much and I still didn't even get soup or a salad."}
{"text":"I was only there once, waiting for the bus after the Home Show at Assembly Hall.  I was there after lunch hour but before dinner, on a Saturday, so things were very quiet.  Sat at the bar, was almost alone.
The Fish Tacos were the best I've had \"inland\".  I'll go back just for them!
The prices were a bit high, like many in-hotel places I guess they assume everyone is on an expense account."}
{"text":"The flat bread and the tomato soup and potato soup was fantastic! The service was great too. Our server for Saturday lunch was very friendly and knowledgeable. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is between tried the cubano egg rolls and they were NOT good. The batter is odd. Other than the egg rolls the experience was wonderful. We were visiting for a work meeting from south Florida and now I'm going to look to see if this restaurant has any locations close to home ."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure I get Houlihan's. It really doesn't do it for me. The last time I was here, I ordered the stuffed chicken and I had a hard time understanding what it was stuffed with, as it just tasted like an overcooked chicken breast. Which usually costs me maybe $2 to make at home. I tried a couple of my friends' dishes and didn't feel like anything stood out there either. For the prices they charge, I was quite disappointed with the quality and unoriginality of the food."}
{"text":"The customer service after my review was excellent.  They apologized for our service and kept in contact with me and welcomed me back to try and right things. Thank you everyone involved."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed by this restaurant. Whether I'm going for a lunch or dinner, the menu is unbeatable. They have so many options, and awesome appetizers. The staff is so friendly and attentive. My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner in their party room and the buffet options were fantastic and our guests raved about the food! 

The patio is the shining star in the place. The lighting, giant fire place and outdoor kitchen create an awesome atmosphere and a relaxing place to unwind. 

I am pretty disappointed they took my favorite meal off the menu (the fritos chicken sandwich), but there are so many more awesome options. I could rave about this place all day!"}
{"text":"Our meal was excellant, the ribs I had were amazing, my girlfriend loved her chicken tenders, and her mother made sure to down her burger. I only have 2 complaints, one is that the sauces were kinda bad (honey mustard comes to my mind the most), and they didn't provide me with wet-naps for my ribs."}
{"text":"stopped down here for a quick lunch. my friend and i ordered a few of the small plates to share which ended up being the perfect amount of food. we shared the bbq chicken flat bread pizza and the spinach dip appetizer. we also each got a cup of soup. i had the french onion, which was alright. the pizza was tasty and the dip was relatively light considering how heavy spinach dips can be sometimes.

service was great. our waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on July 31st. Hostess told us she had one table available outdoors, although we noticed many more, and nobody was ever seated while we have been there. Our waitress was absolutely overwhelmed, it took her forever to take our order, no small plates for the appetizer, beverage refills never came. Guests next to us have been there before us, but got their food after us, and we noticed the manager making some price adjustments for the inconvenience. We ordered the potstickers, they were slimey and obviously undercooked. Not much meat on the ribs either. Extra BBQ sauce upon request, but by the time the waitress delivered we were almost done eating. Not a very pleasent experience."}
{"text":"man, i feel bad writing this b/c our waiter was great and the host was friendly as well but the food was disappointing. the lettuce wrap appetizer was soooooo salty. what in the world. the burger was good but the fries were old and looked unappetizing. the ribs were good but the pineapple fried rice was dry and almost lacked pineapples. the salmon came out burned and black on one side so we had it taken off the tab. the thai chicken was so thin and small but cost $14.25. the asparagus was so burnt it left black streaks on my plate. didn't eat those.

the manager came and apologized but i'm guessing this isn't the first time he had to deal with this issue by the look on his face.

i wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great wings. The thai chili wings are a must. Great service and a bonus...live music. That was a surprise on the patio on a beautiful Tuesday night.

Never ever had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"There was nothing good about our experience there who a group from work. Service was awful, waited 15 minutes for cutlery after food arrived .  Food was cold and 2 orders were wrong. Soda water was mixed with sprite.  Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong.  Hope it's not the norm for this place"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Houlihan's in general and have been to this location a few times.  My favorite item on the menu are the fish tacos.  Every time, I've ordered them they've been flavorful and fresh.  

Most recently, I tried the firecracker shrimp (appetizer as an entree).  They were very good and the portion was very filling for one person.  The shrimp was still tender inside, not rubbery  and had a crispy coating covered in a somewhat spicy sauce.  

My only complaint is that we came during a weekday during their advertised \"appy-hour\".  We were seated in the dining area since we had our baby with us and wanted to order some appetizers and drinks on the happy hour special.  We were told that the special is only in the bar area (which was literally 5 feet away).  

It was disappointing that they couldn't extend the specials to the dining area.  Especially since we weren't really able to sit at the bar or a hi-top table with a baby needing a hi-chair."}
{"text":"Walking into Houlihan's in Westlake is pretty exciting. The decor and atmosphere reminds me of something out of Mad Men. You can almost see Don Draper and Roger Sterling having a drink and enjoying a steak in the dimly lit but warm confines. I have lived in Lakewood for nearly 5 years and yet I completely forgot this place was just down the road. I won't forget that again.

Aside from the classic and elegant decor, the food was very good, the menu broad and eclectic and the service friendly and attentive.

I had the New Orleans Jambalaya. It was hearty, well seasoned and came with 5-6 large shrimp sitting on top of the dish. My wife ordered the Stuffed Chicken Breast and had no complaints. She ordered the Asparagus instead of the Green Beans. The waiter accidentally brought green beans, but it was an honest mistake as it is quite dark inside and I think he saw the green color and assumed. Within 2 minutes the mistake was corrected and hey, free green beans. 

Not an everyday kind of place based in the pricing, $17.95 for Jambalaya, but the quality, ambiance and service make this a place worth spending a little more.

The menu is pretty vast and I am excited to back as soon as possible to try a few more dishes. I might have to order an Old Fashioned, Mr. Draper would approve."}
{"text":"Good service. Food was good. Nothing amazing in the salad that my wife got and the French Onion Soup was just average. But the Flatbread and the fish tacos are amazing. So I would recommend those.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time, everyone's plates were great, great beer assortment. Will definitely be back, bacon app was not the fav but the other apps we got were amazing.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a tall Yuengling before our Duck Tour. 

The place was empty but the beer was cold.

And that's all that mattered."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely horrible. We would only see our server every 30 minutes or longer. Our friend's steak was overcooked. I would definitely not eat here again. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"I am sitting in the restaurant as I type this: service is poor and food is not worth it. We ordered calamari which was hot but had onion rings in it, presumably from the fryer.  Kids ordered a flatbread pizza and a salad so they were decent.  I ordered a 3 pack of sliders.  Awful, just awful. Cold, lacking flavor and not even a fork full of meat. Service is lackluster to the point where I had to go to the bar to get my water refilled.  There are many other choices around the Westlake area to choose from."}
{"text":"Houlihan's is a Houlihan's right? Well yes, and no. This one, located at the edge of a mall happens to have a very nice outdoor patio, with table service. And it's really quite a nice place for lunch or dinner with friends. Service here is very friendly and they have a new gluten free menu. The Parmesan fries totally kick butt. Trust me on this one. Yes, they are GF too."}
{"text":"Hmm, how do I put this?  Ok, straight up then...if you're over 65, this place is for you.  Older crowd and not much more.  Service is at the same pace.

If hit the happy hour on the patio, you might catch a 40 year old.  Not bad, just be prepared to be the youngest in the crowd!"}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos, hubby had a bacon cheeseburger, and the kids had corn dogs. The fish tacos were very tasty!"}
{"text":"An unexpected pleasure just south of the UIUC main campus. I agree with some others that this is an upscale version of TGIF.  Burgers were good, price was fair, food was prepared correctly, and service was okay.  I never pin my hopes too high on anything in this town (except for the outstanding academics), but as stated, my positive experience here is noteworthy."}
{"text":"This is honestly a great place for larger groups. I had a get together of about 12 people and we all came in at different times. Luckily we were there in time for Happy Apps. Appetizers in smaller portions for $3.95. If you sign up for their mailing list, you also get emails about specials on Wednesdays. This time we had $11 specials for entrees.

I ordered the chicken avocado egg rolls as an app and they were hot and crispy. So delicious and shareable. 

My entree was the chicken fettuccine Alfredo. It was a nice portion and the garlic bread it came with was fresh. 

Our server was pretty awesome too. I think his name was Alan. He did a good job with a group of 13 who had a lot of fun and it was a great dinner."}
{"text":"Before a recent night out with a large group of friends, we came to Houlihan's for drinks and appetizers. The atmosphere felt a little traditional and dated. Even though it was Saturday evening, the restaurant was practically empty, and our party of 15 or so really had an entire wing of the place to ourselves. 

Both the service and food were unimpressive. We had two waitresses helping out the table, and the waitress helping my end of the table had an odd personality. As soon as someone would join the table - literally as they were still saying \"hello\" to the group - she would dash over and ask for their order. I'm pretty sure that everyone had to tell her to give them a few minutes before they could order. Her pouncing tactic made the new arrival feel awkward and start searching the menu quickly before they could even settle down. She seemed nice enough otherwise but just needed some common sense and better training.

I ordered a liter of Long Island Iced Tea to share with my husband, but since he wasn't a fan of the flavor, he ordered an additional liter. I normally would be tipsy after 3 drinks, but this entire liter didn't even get me buzzed. We also ordered the White Bean & Artichoke Hummus, which wasn't very special. It all tasted like something that I could've gotten in an average grocery store."}
{"text":"Since this facility is attached to the i-Hotel, the premiere hotel for the University of Illinois, I expected this to be a nicer establishment. What a disappointment!
During the 2-day conference I was attending, I had two meals at Houlihan's. Our group found the lunch specials to be inconsistent, sometimes you received the correct side or topping, sometimes you did not. Both times the service was VERY slow, but the wait staff was kind and genuinely attentive. 
At one point we spoke with a manager regarding our concerns, but did not receive the traditional \"I'll take care of this immediately\", which is the customary Houlihan's reply to complaints.
My best suggestion, go to the Starbucks next door and call it a day."}
{"text":"In my hometown to visit my mom. This place was within walking distance from our hotel. Upon arrival, the place was deserted. Our party of 3 arrived around 4:30. The staff that greeted us were friendly. We ordered the chicken nachos appetizer and it was delicious! Huge! Enough for all 3 of us. I then ordered the So. Cal Fish Tacos and they were just ok - I've had better. The tilapia was had a bit too much breading on it. Generous portions though. My son ordered the chicken tenders with fries and a bowl of tomato bisque soup. He said the soup was buttery! I was surprised at the amount of tenders he had, like 8 or 9 huge pieces. However, they appeared to be left in the grease too long as they were dark colored. He seemed to like them. My other son ordered the fish and chips - again dark colored batter but tasted good (I stole one!). Our server was friendly, attentive and patient with our questions. Service was excellent. I'd probably return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal or experience here. Been a few years since I have been back to the Cleveland area and nope it hasn't changed, except for a couple items on the menu.  I cant see negative reviews here being honest considering I have been to 4 locations in 4 different states and the service is top notch as well as the food.  Shrooms.....best appetizer ever....French onion soup....best....and better than the soup in France......guess the reviewers here don't know that you don't go to this type of place for a steak since its not a steak house.  Any chicken dish or seafood is what you want here.  Would give 5 stars but I subtracted one star since they subtracted the best dish in the place....The Dijon crusted salmon....boo!"}
{"text":"I know, it's a chain restaurant. But don't hate me for going to a non-local restaurant. Each Houlihans in Pittsburgh has a different decor which makes them unique, but across the board the food is consistent, so I like this as a go-to for a quick bite.
I normally go to Houlihans for lunch- their combo lunches are a great deal and the portions are big for lunch. My favorites include the pot roast, which is moist and layered on a pile of mashed potatoes and topped with fried onion straws. I also enjoy their creamy baked potato soup (and it surprisingly isn't that bad nutritionally) and the tortilla soup that is spicy and comes with a dollop of sour cream.
Recently, my wife brought home an ahi tuna salad. When I opened it, I was met with mixed greens, cabbage, sushi grade ahi tuna, and bananas. Wait- bananas and tuna?? I know, I was skeptical too, but surprisingly they go very well together. Definitely give this salad a try.
When I was in college, I lived on their long island iced teas, which come in huge mugs and you can pick from different alcohols to have them mixed with. They also have a decent mix of beers, and the prices aren't too bad. 
Plus, Houlihans has a 15 minute lunch guarantee, and they will actually tell you when it's been longer then 15 minutes which i think is pretty cool.
Make sure you sign up with their loyalty program- free food for your birthday and lots of deals the rest of the year."}
{"text":"This is a mediocre place.  The only thing nice about this location, is that it's in the middle of Station Square Pittsburgh.  Came here with a friend.  The waitress was not too friendly and it seems as though she didn't want to be there.  The food took longer than usual which was frustrating in itself and we started questioning it when we noticed people who came after us, getting their food before us.  When we questioned it, the manager came over and tried to justify the delay but couldn't answer any of my logical questions.  After he said he would look in to it, his answer was half fast and still not satisfy factory.  We had the black angus beef burger cooked to a medium, which doesn't take long to cook.  Even to pay them after we as for the bill, took a long time.  I don't think we will paying this place a visit anymore."}
{"text":"I agree with the first review...I get the feeling it is a step up from Friday's, but is a bit more trendy and refined. I was impressed nonetheless. The lighting was intimate and a great start to the evening of debauchery ahead.

I had the herb-grilled chicken. Healthy, delicious. As a desert, my date and I split a creme brulee and a white chocolate banana cream pie. HEAVEN on my Houlihan's table!"}
{"text":"You know this place is deceiving. It's been there a few years but I never ventured in. I figured, how good could it be...it's a restaurant in the MALL. But I was pleasantly surprised. 

They have a very reasonably priced, yet still interesting menu and great drink specials. They have an active Twitter/Facebook thing going on, sending out special deals and contests to followers, which is something I appreciate. I love the design of the place to boot. The service has always been pleasant and the food is pretty darn good too. Most recently I had a burger there and it was cooked properly and had crispy bacon on top, which is a must for me. I really like the small plates menu they have, especially the spicy chicken avocado egg rolls. For a chain restaurant, they do a really good job at putting out some relatively classy food, and at a great price."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Kind of expensive and the table we were seated at was dirty. The $16 \"big salad\" was about one cup of salad. Do not waste your time or money here. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Great ambiance!  We arrived at six on a Saturday  without a reservation and decided to eat at the bar even though the wait for a table was only 15 minutes.  This was an excellent choice - fantastic bar staff, very comfortable.  Nice menu - reasonably priced.  The food was outstanding and the whole evening was beautiful.  We look forward to coming back soon and enjoying their lovely patio in better weather."}
{"text":"I've been Houlihans several times and I am definitely a fan. While the service has definitely been dopey at times, our food has always been very good. The apps, entre's and even the salads have all been great. I really recommend giving this place more than one chance to shine. The only downfall I feel this place has is the prices- but it's in a hotel, when's the last time you got anything for a normal price in a hotel? It's like buying hot tamales at the theater-"}
{"text":"Had never been here before, went for my free birthday dinner. The host and server were great. Best fish tacos I've had in awhile, and the brownie sundae was amazing! Will be going back just for that sundae!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good at Houlihan's.  It is a fun place to hang out with friends.  Calamari is delicious. French Onion soup is very good. The service is adequate but not great.  Our friends dessert was added to our bill, by mistake.  It is an okay place to eat."}
{"text":"The food here is just ok. The service is absolutely terrible every time I go here. I swear nobody here actually knows the menu or what they have to offer for food or even drinks. Last time I was here I received the wrong food twice before they actually brought of the right food which took another 20 minutes and I couldn't even eat because we had a play to attend at the Assembly Hall. I don't know if they need a management change or just better training but something for sure needs to change for this place to be successful."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday. Was totally empty. Slow service with a new waiter but the food is awesome. Overpriced for what it is, solid menu."}
{"text":"This is not the Houlihan's of my childhood! This is a classy, someone expensive, upscale establishment. With 4 adults and 2 toddlers, we were seated (thankfully) away from all the other guests (it was early maybe just 5p so there was a lot of extra space). The food was good and the staff was friendly and helpful. I don't live in the area, but if I did, I would be adding this to my list of go-to places for when company is in town."}
{"text":"For our first visit to Station Square, we were looking for a place to grab some dinner before a night out at Whim.  There is no shortage of restaurants in Station Square, but they're all (I think) chains and franchises and nothing really caught our fancy.  I remembered Houlihan's from my childhood back in Michigan, and the menu looked tasty, so we stopped in to check it out.

Boy, is this NOT the Houlihan's from my childhood!  A glance at their Wikipedia page shows that back in 2002, Houlihan's revamped their concept from a cozy family restaurant to a still cozy but more trendy restaurant fit for both families and for other groups of folks.  It's still pretty casual and we felt overdressed in our club clothes!

They have a large drink menu with some interesting options, like a \"martini flight\" that lets you try smaller portions of cocktails.  I ordered the X-Rated Flirtini which I was a little embarrassed to say out loud, but it ended up being a tasty, sweet, and strong concoction of champagne and vodka with some exotic fruit juices.  Unfortunately, our server forgot to bring it out.  I did remind him, after our appetizers had already come, and then he went off to get it, but I was disappointed that the whole thing took about 15 minutes.  By the time I got it, our entrees were out.

There is a FourSquare deal here for a free order of fries when you check-in, so we took advantage and ordered the Truckstop Fries, which were covered in \"chipotle cheese sauce.\"  They were tasty, and we observed that they were less salty than we expected, which was a good thing.  I definitely didn't get the \"chipotle\" flavor, which to me is smoky and rich.  They were clearly going for a southwestern vibe, I think there were scallions and such on the fries, but the chipotle flavor was missing.

We ordered some mini-sliders that were tastier than we expected - I think the pulled pork in particular we enjoyed, and we split the Brentwood Chicken Sandwich which was simple but fresh and well-prepared.  It was a good amount of food for two people and we were way too full for dessert.

I wouldn't go out of my way to return here, but I feel like this is a good option if you are down in Station Square and need to grab a bite.  The menu is creative, you will absolutely find something that satisfies a craving.  Even the unhealthy options taste a little more fresh, because they don't overdo the salt.  Still, service was a bit slow and forgetful, and the food really wasn't memorable.  But sometimes you don't need memorable, you just need dinner."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped here for dinner on the way to a weekend event in a Pittsburgh Airport hotel, having driven several hours thru the pouring rain from the DC-area. Needless to say, we were exhausted and famished. Something sit-down, casual, but not fast food. I remember Houlihan's from college happy hour days, but don't recall eating anything but nachos. 

This place was pleasant enough, but in a plain way, and the food wasn't particularly memorable. I ordered the Fish & Chips, but when I asked for some malt vinegar -- a pub staple condiment -- I got a look as if I had a 3rd eye (in the center of my forehead). \"We have balsamic, we have white, but what's malt vinegar?\"

Never mind, I'll just use this catsup over here..."}
{"text":"This is a really decent chain of casual dining restaurants. Good food, friendly service, and not too expensive. MILES above Chilis, TGI Fridays or Applebee's."}
{"text":"Every time the beautiful weather comes back Houlihann's is the first place I want to go. It is my go to for happy hour and appetizers on their outdoor patios. They offer $3.99 appetizers and drink specials on their amazing long islands. They have an array of different flavored long islands you can choose from such as peach, angry orchard, Texas, raspberry, etc. And the best part is that they offer pitcher sizes! My go to appetizer is always the shrooms. Mushrooms with a cream cheese mixture and a breeding around the whole thing served with a horseradish dipping sauce. It has amazing flavor and it's a must try. If you are looking to order an entree as well I would give the fish tacos a try. I haven't been able to try anything else because they are that good. 

My only complaint is that they don't do happy hour specials if you are dining. You must be seated at the bar on at a table on the patio to receive the specials. This isn't clearly displayed anywhere and the staff doesn't let you know either. I went here in the winter months for dinner during happy hour and obviously I couldn't sit outside on the patio so we sat inside. I ordered drinks to later find out on my bill they don't do happy hour pricing. Which is why I only go here during the warmer months.

{"text":"Stopped in after a long day of shopping and was looking forward to a great meal. We were greeted and seated quickly and ordered soft drinks. It was stifling hot inside, enough to where you're just sweating while sitting. The server brought our drinks and gave us a few minutes to decide on food. We couldn't stop fanning ourselves with our menus and decided to walk to other parts of the restaurant to see if it was cooler in another spot. It wasn't, so we mentioned to our server that we couldn't possibly stay because of the heat, and she agreed that it was really hot in there. We had barely taken a few sips of our drinks, but we were charged $6.24 for them. Don't get me wrong, I don't ever proclaim that something is wrong to get free food. But to charge us for two Cokes in a situation that we couldn't control, seemed like poor customer service. We won't be back and that's a shame."}
{"text":"Arrived at Houlihans on a Tuesday a little after 5:00. We were shown to a table in the bar which was strange because the dining room was empty. But ok. Soon after we order an older man comes in trying to pick up older women. Ok. The check comes and I give the waitress a birthday certificate which gives you one free entree with the purchase of another. Soon a manager? comes over to tell us since we ordered two sandwiches we were not entitled to one free.   I wasn't aware that a 50 cent difference in an entree and a sandwich would cause the certificate to be invalid. The way the menu reads it really doesn't state the entrees. Needless to say we paid for both sandwiches about 25.00. No offer of a free dessert to make up for it. To add insult to injury my husband lost his crown eating his chicken sandwich. All in all a terrible experience. We will never be back! Very bad customer service."}
{"text":"It's bar food.  The server was friendly, but it's definitely more of a bar than a restaurant.  Crawl for Cancer was there and the Ohio game was on, so it was packed, but fun."}
{"text":"me and a friend went on friday 13th ... and service was nice food was awesome .. i had the chicken nachos and 4 an appetizer i had the smushrooms and a couple of caborna mojhitos .. nice portion and friendly wait staff ... just a great dining experience"}
{"text":"I like houlihans, I really do. However, tonight made it drop a star or two in my view.

We had a table of 8 before seeing a movie. The server was very quick and took care of everything no problem. The food was very good and my drinks were delicious. I like that they have a lot of healthy options for food. They also have different side dishes than what you are used to seeing.

Get the black cherry mojito! Second best mojito at a chain (number one is Cheesecake Factory)

My problem is that we came here for Happy Hour and it is only at the bar. With 8 girls, we could not fit at the bar. 2 drinks and a flatbread pizza cost me $38 dollars which is just crazy. So just beware, do not plan to have your happy hour here! This is more of a date night restaurant!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you something.... it is not easy to make a good French Onion Soup! It is quite easy to screw this one dish up....But Houlihan's passes the test and serves one of the best French Onion soups that I have had the pleasure of eating. In fact, I peeled off the cheese on the side of the bowl because it was that delicious! 

My main course was an Atlantic Salmon with bread salad and asparagus.... I will just have to deal with the \"smelly pee-pee\" that is commonly associated with asparagus! The salad consisted of arugula (or Rocket) and was served with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. 

This place was packed on a Friday night, was very clean, and the service was friendly to the point that the servers were constantly apologetic for things that did not require apology. They definitely had an \"I can do it\" attitude and believed in good customer service."}
{"text":"The stuffed mushrooms are the reason why I keep returning here.  They are fantastic.  We didn't finish them all and our server kindly boxed them and put a fresh side sauce in the container - small things like that matter in service.

I had the TAOS CHIPOTLE TURKEY WRAP smoked turkey, guacamole, pepper jack cheese, cilantro, lettuce, tomato & chipotle dressing $9.95.  I couldn't taste the guacamole or the cilantro.  The wrap was just OK and I probably wouldn't order it again.  My friend got the SOUTHWEST GRILLED CHICKEN WRAP  spicy pecans, red peppers, bacon, tortilla straws, pepper jack cheese, garlic ranch, house salsa $9.95, and again it was just O.K.  Nothing special and no real outstanding flavors. 

This might just be a cocktail and appetizer place for me.  

Food was a 3 STAR, service was a 4 STAR"}
{"text":"A good place to take a break from shopping! Nice upscale decor and very good service. The stuffed mushroom are very good. I had the buffalo chicken salad and it was really good! A glass of wine comes in a carafe so it's more like a glass and a half, okay by this girl! Seems kinda pricey for what you get, but eh, I guess you pay for not having to eat at the food court."}
{"text":"I've always loved Houlihans  I have a mixed review for my visit yesterday.  

Pros:  the service is always the best. Yesterday was no exception. Chelsea was attentive without being intrusive.  

Whoever was cooking knows how to cook chicken!  I'm low carbing and I got the Brentwood chicken sandwich and ditched the bun.  The chicken was grilled and had that perfect black grill mark and taste in the outside and juicy inside.  Not easy to accomplish. I loved my lunch!  


Cons: water with no ice is big in other countries.  They have the water glasses sitting on the table already and they bring a bottle of water for the table to share.  The water had a funny taste and without ice, it wasn't cold enough.  It's a nice concept, but doesn't work. 

The side salads used to be a full portion. Yesterday it was a very tiny portion. This place isn't cheap, and they need to give full portions.  

Overall, I still love Houlihans.  I'll be back. :)."}
{"text":"Service was alright. Prompt and I tend to not base reviews off of service because as a service industry person myself, I know that's super unfair. They were out of what I wanted so I settled for a veggie burger and fries with a side salad. The side salad was good, it was the best part. My burger was gross. It had clearly been sitting under a hot lamp for a while. Fries were that weird - have been sitting out texture. The burger was burnt and room temp and the cheese was solidified. Also when you pay 8.50 for a Long Island iced tea, you'd expect there would be alcohol in it, right? Well, I didn't even feel a buzz. It has to have been watered down. It was a huge glass and I was sober as a nun. Anyway I was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just got the keys to our new apartment today! We decided to stop for lunch because we knew it would be a longgggg day today. We wanted somewhere that we could sit down and just enjoy a meal together. We drove over to the Houlihan's in Southpark Mall, we always like to try places we've never been to, so needless to say, it was our first visit here. We loved the interior and how it was very contemporary, and very cozy! It was happy hour so I was extra happy! I ordered a $4 Angry Orchard, and we also ordered house salads, and the spinach dip with chips as an appetizer. Our salads came out first, and when Houlihan's says their food is fresh and housemade, they aren't kidding! Everything in the salads was so fresh and delicious. When the chips came out.... I COULDN'T STOP EATING THEM! They were the best restaurant chips I have ever had, very thin and crispy, I just loved them. We waited about 15 minutes before asking where my Angry Orchard was. They said they had to change the keg and since they are in a mall, they had to go out of the restaurant and around the corner to get it and then they had to clean out the line. But when that beer came out.... omg it was so fresh!! We waited.a little while for our entrees but then they came out the portion size was huge! I really wish that I could give this place 4 stars but the service just wasn't there for me personally. The food though, was really good!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying I hate chain restaurants.  That said, Houlihan's really surprised me.  We were entertaining a prospective student and Houlihan's seemed like an American enough option that would please any palate, so we went for lunch on a Saturday.  I got the grilled shrimp and the parmesan frites, and damn, they were pretty good!  The shrimp were cooked perfectly, seemed fresh, and came with guac (love!).  The fries came with three awesome sauces--the garlic aioli was the best but there was also a ranch and a spicy barbecue.  Other folks got fish tacos and the veggie burger, and they were also pleasantly surprised.  Service was attentive, interior was pretty classy, and a good enough value that I'd go back again if I find myself in Station Square.  If you have a picky eater but still want to find some decent selections for yourself, Houlihan's is a solid option."}
{"text":"I would've given 4-5 stars but they just discontinued my all time favorite menu item--the grilled mahi mahi topped with citrus crab salad.   The rest of the menu is pretty good but this was absolutely delicious every time. We literally would go 2-3 times a week to order this.   Now we are more once every couple months diners.    Hopefully Mgmt will read this review and bring the mahi mahi back permanently."}
{"text":"I actually think this place is decent for a nicer version of TGI Friday. 

Service was good. Food was nicely decorated and tasted good. I got the filet mignon which was good but it wasn't worth 22 bucks. my friends on the other hand got fish tacos and they all liked it ($10). we got Bruschetta(?) for appetizer which was really good. Ambiance was cool. Decent (albeit expensive) drink menu. I mean, it's a fine dining version of TGI, what did you expect?

Overall, I enjoyed my visit there. I would go back there again."}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast menu is a little limited in options, but the egg white omelette I ordered was delicious. $9 got a full plate of bacon, toast, omelette, and breakfast potatoes. Not very busy on Sunday morning either!"}
{"text":"I have been working in downtown Cleveland for 14 years. I have had lunch nearly every place possible. But one thing I have always loved is the chicken fingers from Houlihans. ( The Shrooms were also on this list but over the years they have drastically gone downhill)  I know businesses needed to change and grow but I sincerely feel it has been for the worst. Me and 5 of my buddies ate at this location for months every Friday. I would get the chicken fingers platter with mashed potatoes instead of fries with green beans and a salad. The price was fair. But after a while the price went up and you got less food. No more green beans. Which caused us to find food elsewhere. Today in Cleveland it was terribly cold and I decided to give Houlihans another try. But I was wrong in making this choice.  The chicken fingers have lost part of their luster. The Mashed potatoes were flavorless lumpy & watery. When waiting for my food I was largely ignored while my call in order sat there getting colder. I know from time to time I will want more chicken fingers from here but I will hesitate and think about it long and hard"}
{"text":"Excellent meal- had the Prime meat loaf and they know how to make martinis!
Wonderful atmosphere and not too crowded."}
{"text":"Over a year passed since I had last stopped by Houlihan's.  A friend recommended coming here for happy hour.  Based on my prior experiences, I knew to keep my expectations low.  Instead, I had a great time.  I came back a few days later and had another pleasant meal.  As far as chain restaurants go, Houlihan's ranks well above average.  I've skimmed the other reviews, and I can't be sure if I've just been lucky, but I certainly didn't suffer the problems of other customers (e.g., bland food, poor service).

Lunch options are generously portioned and reasonably priced.  Complimentary soup or salad is served with entrees, sandwiches/wraps, and pizzas.  I've tried the baked potato soup and chicken tortilla soup and have trouble picking a favorite; both are savory and very thick/hearty.  If you're concerned about skimpy salads, each of the signature salads come with a healthy proportion of greens-to-\"toppings\" (candied pecans, Gorgonzola cheese, chicken, etc.).

The tapas-style menu really makes this a fun spot for happy hour.  There are a LOT of options here (more than 40+), ranging in size from small to medium to entree-size.  You'll find something, even if you're a picky eater (and Houlihan's takes special consideration if you mention being gluten-intolerant, vegetarian/vegan, etc.).  I love being able to pick out a few things to share with friends, but I can also see this as a great option if you have a light appetite and want truly modest portions of rich mashed potatoes or filling pasta.  (Or if you have a diverse appetite and just want to eat bites of a lot of different things!)  You can get small, \"appetizer\"-sized portions of their mac-and-cheese (yum!), grilled skewers, asparagus salad, and white bean hummus (DELISH).  I eat hummus as an appetizer at many places, and while they vary in success, I found Houlihan's hummus with grilled pita to be plate-lickingly GOOD (surprising especially for a chain!).

The other essential element for happy hour are drinks, and Houlihan's is stocked with a full bar, along with a menu of suggested cocktails.  Some of these drinks are more sophisticated, compared to the corn-syrupy messes you get served at most chain restaurants.  For women watching their weight, Houlihan's also serves a number of fruity drinks from the \"Skinny Girl\" brand (great for minimizing the damage that restaurants can do to your diet)."}
{"text":"We have been Houlihan's customers for 15 years or so, but cannot continue to go there anymore.  Their prices have skyrocketed as of late, and I don't find eating there a decent value anymore.  They lost our business for that reason alone."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner after a Duck boat tour of Pittsburgh!
We were sat at a table right away, after a few min were greeted and ordered drinks and a app.  I then checked in on four square and was given a special offer for free fries, I asked about it and yes FREE !
So I order fries and we ll ordered of dinners.... My fried pork sandwich was out of this world good... But when the bill came the FREE fries were still on the check but my other half had already paid the check. :-(
On our way out 2 employees and a female manger talking at the hospo desk never said goodbye or asked how things were.... So food A but service and overall staff D..  Hospitality and service employees don't know what service really means anymore!"}
{"text":"Was just ok - and expensive to just be ok. Tuna appetizer was not very good, tuna had funky taste. Ribs were good, wife's salmon was good. 

Service was good but there are better food options in the area. 

Yelp wants me to write more but there isn't much more to say, the layout is nice, service staff is excellent but the food just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"First of all, was meeting a friend but wanted to order a drink and appetizer. Waitress ignored me. Finally asked hostess to have SOMEONE wait on me. Be very wary of their happy hour appetizer $5 \"deals\"...they reduce the sizes! Had spinach dip and chips, and the bowl of dip was ridiculously small. Then, wanted to try a \"new\" summer blue drink. Couldn't get because they were out of Rumchatta. Waitress started walking away. No suggestions offered. Had to flag her down for another choice. So sad that Strongsville chains are really pathetic!"}
{"text":"This was an unexpected stop during my most recent trip to Station Square. Originally, my party and I were going to stop to eat at Hard Rock, but there was a 30 minute wait time and we were all starving, so off to Houlihan's we went. 

We walked and and we were seated immediately. Our waitress was really great. She went out of her way and met every request. At first glace of the menu, I was a bit underwhelmed. Burger, steak, and salads are your main options. Perhaps I expected a larger menu selection. 

Regardless of the menu, my party and I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer. It was delicious. It came with slices of (I think) pita bread and it was so, so good. All of us commented on how good it was. 

For my entree I ordered a burger. I will say the burger was quite tasty. It had some flavor and was decently seasoned. The fries it came with were also very good. 

Everyone with me commented that the food was good. 

All in all, I have to say the food was good and satisfying, but it was overpriced. Maybe that's to be somewhat expected for the area, but even then, it was a bit much. 

It was a satisfying meal, but unless I have a coupon I'm not sure if I'll return right away."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. The food was not tasty and ended up returning the pot roast because my friend could not stomach it. Appetizers were okay, better than the main entrees"}
{"text":"I typically really like Houlihan's, but my recent experience at this location left a lot to be desired.  We wandered in on a Tuesday night and managed to get a table right away as it wasn't crowded.  After perusing the massive menu, my brother and I decided that we'd get some appetizers to share.

We started with the nachos - they were just OK.  They were topped with ground chicken that seemed to be completely unseasoned.  We both ate around the chicken.  It was also an odd gray color, but I won't dwell on that.  Then we opted to try a couple of sliders and the Houlihan's version of the \"poutine.\"  The sliders were decent, but the poutine was awful.  It's fries topped with their pot roast and gravy and some cheese.  The fries were obviously straight out of the freezer and hadn't been cooked quite long enough so they weren't crispy at all.  They also appeared to not have stuck the entire dish in the oven, but just topped the undercooked fries with the gravy and pot roast, and then some cheese.  So the cheese wasn't melted, and it was all just kind of gross.  It was really disappointing.

And then finally we got the bill - we each had 2 glasses of wine, and 3 appetizers and it was $70?  No thanks.  I can think of many other places to spend less of my money on much better food."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Food was acceptable. I had a burger. It wasn't huge, but cooked well. Server was nice and food came out fast. I there were more people working there than people eating there. Place was clean and location is convenient."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday, chosen because it was food allergen friendly.
The lettuce wraps were good, but overall still felt overpriced."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm surprised, too.  We used to go to Houli's all the time until about 3-4 years ago when it started to seriously go downhill.  After it was rehabbed (and, man, was it rehabbed!), somebody mentioned it had really been upgraded in every respect, so we gave it a try. 

And, man, are we glad we did. While we haven't tried a large percentage of what's on their menu (which would take us eating there 5x a week for twenty-seven years), what we have tried was excellent. 

LOVED the burger sliders app, the seared rare tuna wrap, the bruchetta, their chicken quesadilla damn near achieves legendary status (I'm sorry I cheated on you, Mi Pueblo, but she is SOOOO delectable and yummy!!), their Tuscan salad is so unique it deserves special mention, and on and on. 

NO, I don't work there. NO, I don't prefer chains and would much rather visit locally owned places, NO, I haven't lost my mind, but, YES, I'm damn well going back there next week. GOOD IS GOOD, FOLKS, regardless of the name on the front!! This place deserves your attention."}
{"text":"I'm done with this place.  I have been several times to this location always during lunch with varying results.  Today a friend and I were seated in a bar booth without asking, although there were plenty of other places on the restaurant side.  Our waitress was ridiculously slow.  She actually got slower as lunch wore on although I only saw she had three tables to wait on.  We were there from 11:50 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. for lunch in a near empty restaurant.  Asked for our checks at 1:05 she said in a minute.  10 minutes later she brought them.  We waited another 15 and she never came back to run our cards.  We had to go to the hostess stand and get a manager to check us out.  The food isn't that good to give this another chance.  Won't go back, ever."}
{"text":"YELPING as I sit in the restaurant!! Been here several times. Today may just be the very last. Service BLOWS!
Got seat immediately waiter (male) came right over, I couldn't decide what I would like to order, I the midst of getting a drink ordered and severed, he was cut! Really, mid service, tacky! Not his fault! Laura became our non existent waitress, AWFUL!  Don't done with my soup and my entree was on the heels. SPREAD IT OUT! Got fajitas, served with ONE tortilla! That's right folks, ONE! Such crap! I was able to get TWO more by a girl walking thru the place! If you don't have enough help, how about not cutting people when they have a table already. Management Fail! No one smiles in this place! Oh wait, the runner delivering the food is at least smirking."}
{"text":"A really bad bar and an incredibly poorly run restaurant.  A U shaped bar, high top tables scattered everywhere.  TV's in every direction.  Everything has that cheesy, corny chain vibe.  Bartenders are not intentionally bad, but when it is obvious that management doesn't care, why should anyone else?

Generic, frozen food that is just reheated when ordered.  Still, they manage to get grease fires.  Literally, came to the hotel to pick up a friend as I was going to a wedding.  We decided to have a drink before hand.  Everyone was evacuated because there was a grease fire in the kitchen.  Fire department shows up and quickly takes care of everything.  They let us back in to finish our drinks, but no food :)

Have eaten here before that, and might as well just buy everything from the frozen section at Schnucks, and reheat.  It is the same thing.

They do have Bell's on tap, but frozen pint glasses, and ice crystals form in the glass.  Yeah, don't know what the point of drinking frozen beer is?  Maybe the Macros have brainwashed people to think otherwise, but no reason to drink Bells Best Brown like that.

For some reason a popular spot before an Illini game, and apparently a nice hotel.  Though one of my least favorite bars and restaurants in Chambana."}
{"text":"This place has tasty food but is rather pricey. The drinks are usually good but sometimes mixed poorly. The staff is friendly but it often is a long time between visits, especially on the patio. The beer garden/ patio is the nicest one in town until the live music starts which generally makes any conversation impossible. Their version of a \"pitcher\" is a big glass that is pretty much impossible to pour from and actually meant for one person so don't get too excited about Friday's special of $6 pitchers of long island iced teas. Their brownie sundae is amazing and adequate for 4 adults to share. They have a good variety on their menu and plenty of tasty vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Wow, I knew the place was filthy but after looking at the Champaign Co health departments most recent inspection report, I'm surprised no one has gotten severely sick from here. Score of 70 but after weighing repeat, critical violations, adjusted score of 38.  NASTY!!  Employees handling food without gloves. Food not being held at temp. Report shows Italian sausage at 60 degrees. Can we say all bacteria growth is welcome here. It was bad when I worked there with the roaches, centipedes, millipedes, fruit flies. Just nasty, gross. Even had a roach walk across the table while a server was taking an order. This place should be shut down. Such a shame that a beautiful hotel has a filthy, gross restaurant attached. 
Check out their reports here. They're all bad with repeats of several critical violations.

{"text":"Because I would be arriving during Mother's Day weekend at U of I, I emailed ahead and asked if I could make a reservation since I knew it would be packed.   I received an answer promptly and was accommodated.  Service was great and friendly.  Our party enjoyed chicken parm, fish tacos and the chicken wraps.  All were very tasty.    My contact via email, Sam, came over to our table and checked how things were going.   We all enjoyed our experience and will be back.  Thanks to Sam and Pete for going out of their way to make our dining experience a pleasant one!"}
{"text":"I had the Veggie Burger which was excellent with a hint of spice.

My wife had the Salmon Burger with bacon which she said was very good."}
{"text":"I had the pot roast. 3 bite size pieces of cold meat and a pile of soggy fried onions over mashed potatoes. Not impressive. Not worth the money. The potato soup was pretty tasty though."}
{"text":"We don't have Hoolihans in Toronto so I wasn't sure what to expect when I came to this one during a trip to Cleveland.
I loved it. LOVED IT! The prices were great, the food that we had was AWESOME. My friend had the chicken parm and couldn't even finish it even though it was so delicious that he wanted to. I had the stuffed mushroom caps and I was in HEAVEN. It was the first time I'd ever had them and I couldn't believe that I had missed out for so long. 
Not only was the food amazing, but the music they played in the restaurant was kick-ass as well. On the last page of the menu it listed all the music they played which I thought was pretty cool, I'd never seen that before. 
My next trip to the States will definitely include a visit to a Hoolihans."}
{"text":"The food is always very good when we visit. My husband thinks Houlihans lettuce wrap appetizer isn't as good as PF Changs. 
I love their smaller portion menu. Today I had their chopped side salad and \"small portion\" BBQ chicken flatbread. I have no complaints. :) 
The restrooms were nice and clean, which is a definate plus in my book."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Houlihan's on date night before a movie inside the mall. We were thoroughly impressed. Well decorated, nice bathrooms, all of the staff that we came into contact with was pleasant and friendly. The spinach dip appetizer was absolutely delicious. Our meals took a little longer than usual but the waitress explained that she had made a mistake in putting in our orders and she corrected herself and was extremely apologetic. After our meals arrived two different managers came to check on us and were very friendly and helpful. I had a steak and it was decadent, as well as a huge loaded baked potato. My husband loved his food as well. They had American pub fare with a twist. We will be back to Houlihan's! Thank you for a great date night meal."}
{"text":"What a neat little place! Amazing ambience. Of course, the place will really light up on a game day.

They have got a good menu. A good selection of small plates (2-4 of these would be one meal) with very reasonable prices. A traditional selection of regular appetizers. 

The drink selection is great. They have pretty much everything on the menu but I dont know if they really have it behind the bar. The happy hours are very attractive. Not as much as other places but still great. 

We went for a dinner one evening. We were served by an apprentice waiter. She did a good job and the person over seeing her was very courteous and respectful too. They offered to correct our drink when we were not satisfied with the one we got. The beer selection is satisfying. 

The small plates are delicious and will leave you wanting more. But thats what they are designed to be. Delicious small portions. The sliders are tasty. The chicken is moist and tender. Great going so far.

The entrees are a hit or miss. I particularly did not like my Salmon. It was tough, chewy and smelled a little. I do no like seafood when it smells of seafood. Yeah .. fresh seafood does not smell at all and feels tender yet firm when you cut it / chew. This one was definitely a miss. The grilled shrimp entree was good. The shrimp did not suffer the same fate as the salmon.

Save room for desserts for sure! Good selection of individual desserts priced reasonably.

Highly recommended for:
happy hours
small plates
appetizers
desserts
bar menu

Inconsistent about:
entrees

Looking forward to try their brunch!

Watch out for:
the happy hour listed on the site is no longer valid. They have a different happy hour configuration now."}
{"text":"I am staying at the IHotel, which is connected to Houlihans.  I went down to put in a take out order, because there is no takeout menu in my room.  They got my drink and gave me a menu at the bar, but never came back for my order.  I was trying to make eye contact and waving the menu and my glass for awhile, then starting waving my arms in the air.  Nothing.  Granted, they were busy but I watched them wait on other people coming in while I got nothing.  I felt like I was invisible!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food,  drinks and the location are equally amazing. My favorite is their peach long Island ice tea and the chicken avocado egg rolls. The service is always fast and the servers are always caring. Good service and good food always brings me back."}
{"text":"Note: The kitchen is only open until 10PM Sundays through Thursdays and until 12:30AM on Friday and Saturday nights. The bar's open until 12AM Sundays through Thursdays and until 2AM on Friday and Saturday nights. 

Each time I've come here, it was for a pre-concert meal. Back in 2007,  first visited Houlihan's with my sister (shut up) prior to catching the Concert Express out to Burgettstown to see Rush (the band, not the gasbag conservative). Back then, I ordered what turned out to be a pretty spiffy steak salad along with a fine, Asian-style calamari appetizer and their brilliantly desconstructed S'Mores dessert. Early last week, Kay and I stopped in before seeing  two bands you won't hear on Houlihan's alterna-indy playlist (trying too hard?), at the Trib Total Media Amphitheatre nearby; Whitesnake and Mr. Big. 

I wanted that steak salad again, but they no longer carry it. Instead, I got something similar called the Prime Steak and Wedge Salad; the wedding of a 5 ounce sirloin steak and a hunk of iceberg lettuce decorated with pecans, bacon bits, and scallions. Golden beet chunks, grilled asparagus, fried polenta triangles, and a slice of gorgonzola fill up the pews. Blue cheese, a dressing I loathe more than any other, is your default. I was thankfully allowed to opt for their ranch dressing instead. 

Making for a nice, light dinner, the small steak was as tender as a kiss. juicy as a celebrity scandal, and was gorgeously dark on the outside, neon pink on the inside. The iceberg wedge was fresh, crispy, its garnishes giving it snap further texture. The dark horse components of the plate were the polenta triangles, which resembled a crouton-tater tot hybrid in taste and appearance. If the ranch dressing was bottled, I couldn't tell. Speaking of the dressing, it was served on the side in a metal cup, and there was enough left over after dressing the lettuce, so you know I dipped everything else into the ranch to saporific effect, including the immaculately cooked asparagus. 

Our appetizer was a plate of he Disco Fries; an orgy of french fries, gravy, pot roast, and mozzarella cheese. In Canada they use cheese curds and call it poutine. I call it pretty damn groovy despite the cheese not being gooey enough. Put this between two slices of white bread, serve it at a diner, and you'll make some truckers happy. 

Kay got their godly, incomparable S'Mores Crock for dessert. I had a Chocolate Cappuccino Cake, and it's essentially Little Debbie marrying for money; a high-end lunch cake served with ice cream. I liked it, but once Kay enlisted me to help her finish her S'Mores crock, I had forgotten about it. Let's face it, Houlihan's needs no other dessert. 

P.S. I have nothing bad to say about the service. Our waiter Tony did his job well. 

P.P.S. My playlist would likely chase people out of the place and perhaps bring in a whole new clientele. I'll counter your Black Keys  with some Black Label Society...

{"text":"First off, Houlihan's is 3.5 stars, not 3. I usually reserve 4 stars for places I adore but it's still quite good, for what it is, which is a chain/mall/cookie cutter restaurant.

What sets Houlihan's apart for me is the service, which is almost always fantastic. The day we visited I had a problem with my veggie burger, which was fixed immediately, and the manager came out to check and make sure the remedy was satisfactory. Our server Matt M. was a doll, energetic and sweet and personable, without being too over the top.

We had the stuffed mushrooms appetizer and the arugula flatbread, which were both delicious, if not incredibly original. 
I originally ordered the veggie burger, which was inedible and was immediately replaced with the veggie enchiladas, which were good and filling. 
The happy hour prices are ridiculously cheap, so next time we'll come here for that."}
{"text":"Years ago, Houlihan's used to be a really trendy place to go and we frequently did. 

It's been awhile since we've dined there and we won't be returning. 

First, I want to say that our service was absolutely 5 star. The waiter was friendly, accommodating, professional and attentive. However, that's where the positivity ends. 

They seem to have switched to the refillable glass bottle for their water like some other restaurants have.  Usually, this adds tons of convenience and we enjoy not having to wait for refills. However the stench and taste of the presented water made us question if it was even safe for consumption. It smelled and tasted like sewage. We aren't sure if the bottle itself doesn't get clean enough, if it doesn't get dry or if the water is just that bad. We opted not to continue drinking it and instead ordered other drinks. 

We ordered our meals and we both used the restroom. The odor outside of the restroom was absolutely horrific. It continued inside the restroom. It smelled worse than any porta potty I've ever encountered. I held my breath as much as possible. They seem to be aware of the smell as there are air fresheners inside the actual restrooms. It again, smells like sewage. For as long as I can remember, their bathroom has had an unpleasant smell and was dirty, however this time, it was absolutely unbearable. It seems like their plumbing problem has significantly worsened over the years. 

The cleanliness of the bathroom was also extremely worrisome. It was absolutely disgusting. It seems like it doesn't ever get actually cleaned. The floors, walls and even sink were just caked with nastiness. We were so grossed out, that we literally discussed leaving for fear of the kitchens cleanliness. 

We returned to our booth and started noticing how filthy that was too. There was hair, crumbs and other dirt visible in the booth seams. The table itself wasn't cleaned. At this point we were gagging and didn't know what to do. 

Our food arrived and everything had a very weird taste to it, it made us too nervous to eat the food so we opted not to. It wasn't worth becoming sick over. We paid our check (it wasn't the waiters fault) and left and had dinner at another restaurant inside the galleria. 

When public spaces in a restaurant are grimy, you have to seriously consider how disgusting non-public spaces (aka the kitchen) might be. If people aren't taking the care to clean the tables or the restrooms, then I have to question whether or not my food is being prepared in a sanitary way. 

I genuinely hope that Houlihan's gets the deep clean that they need and figure out whatever plumbing issues they are dealing with. The galleria is now home to all kinds of great new restaurants and they are all clean and smell free. They won't be able to compete."}
{"text":"We are regular customers here. Stopped in for dinner tonight with my wife who always gets the salmon. The meal came out and she asked that it be cooked slightly longer (which has never happened before). The manager (who we also have not seen before) proceeds to come out to tell her that \"next time she should tell the server she wants it well done because that is how it is supposed to be cooked\". After a short conversation she ended up admitting they are training a new cook. Poor service especially when we are regulars. Hope that the cook learns the correct way to cook a fish! We will be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for afternoon drinks and appetizers. Our waitress seemed like she didn't want to be there and wasn't happy at all. We ordered the potstickers, the chicken egg rolls & the peach Long Island iced teas for our mom's day out. I was sadly disappointed in the potstickers which were very dark on the bottom and had a burnt taste to them. The chicken egg rolls were good and so was our drink, but this visit was just okay... Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Yum!  That hit the spot!  I wandered around campus for a good hour looking for a place to enjoy a nice meal and glass of wine but had no luck near the college, so I came back to the hotel where I am staying. I wanted a steak but thought the 8 oz filet was a little pricey and large so I settled on the 4 oz filet (and subbed fries for a house salad for $2).  My steak was perfectly cooked and was served with a side of broccolini and a dab of buttery sauce for only $10!!  The 8 oz fillet is only $25 and comes with sides and a salad so that's not a bad deal either. I also had breakfast here this morning and was very satisfied with my scrambled eggs and bacon. I would definitely recommend this place. I know it's my first review, but it's legit. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Houlihan's the other night for dinner with the family.  We were told we had a 10 minute wait, so I went to JCPenney while my family waited for the table.  I was able to make it to JCPenney and back just in time to place my order.  I recall Houlihan's having great fish tacos, so that is what I ordered on this visit.  I also ordered a yummy craft beer that I can't seem to recall the name of.  It was unfiltered and on tap, which I loved.

I was shopping online while waiting for our food, which was cool, but no free wifi and the mall wifi was out of range, unfortunately.  Finally, our food arrived.  My daughter ordered blackened chicken Alfredo pasta, my son ordered chicken tenders and french fries, and my wife ordered the margarita flat bread.  I tasted the chicken in my daughter's pasta and it was grilled and very tasty.  She wasn't able to finish her portion though.  My wife gave me a piece of her pizza and it was good, but not remarkable.  My fish tacos were stellar.  I received two heaping fish tacos that had all the right fixins.  I loved them and can't wait to eat them again.  The salsa and tortilla chips were good too.  This is definitely one of my favorite dishes anywhere.

The only drawback is the prices are creeping up."}
{"text":"Nothing horrible to write, yet nothing spectacular either. 

We were brought the wrong appetizer, they corrected that quickly.
The thai grilled chicken was fantastic, the rice was bad. The other persons in my group got salad and fried food, they said they were good.

Our server was wonderful and kept on-top of things. We got another server briefly for some reason who was rude and kept getting things wrong.  (Note: they were busy)

Very mixed experience, but I would love to come back again sometime to try it out once more."}
{"text":"In Cleveland tonight & found this place. Quite nice, great atmosphere, and good food. The staff was also friendly, quick service.  I highly recommended it."}
{"text":"We arrived at 7:20 last night and asked for a seat outside since it was a gorgeous day. We were immediately seated outside. However, the waitress avoided eye contact with us and no one even asked us for a drink of water for 20 minutes. When my fiancé went up to the bar to get someone's attention,  the manager was too busy speaking to his friend. My fiancé literally had to gesture him to come his way. Then, the manager yelled at the waitress in front of customers instead of picking up the slack. The waitress who was also the busboy looked overworked. My fiancé ordered a short beer but was given a large and charged for it too. I ordered a water with a lemon and I never got the lemon.  Our nachos arrived a little cold. We were given dirty looks by the workers. All we wanted was beer and nachos.  It's not that much to ask for. Needless to say, we probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I give it one star because it was clean. Everything else was horrible! The food tasted bland and conjured up memories of really bad TV dinners. I had the pot roast - icky, icky, icky. I probably could have had better pot roast from a frozen meal at a much cheaper price! My friend had a dry piece of \"Thai\" chicken with rice and rubbery asparagus. Again, icky! 45$ for a crappy lunch! Live and learn...."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, great choices for vegetarians and those with gluten sensitivity. Our group has several dietary restrictions and they were very accommodating. The flatbreads were fabulous, the Tuscan bean salad was so full of flavor and the perfect size. Our server, Chris, was probably the most efficient and friendly server I've had in a long time. The place was pretty packed and he always made us feel like we were his only table. Great food, great service, great atmosphere! P"}
{"text":"The food here is decent.  Started off with the Chipotle Chicken Nachos...definitely not what I'm used to, but I still had no issue finishing them.  I then followed with the fish tacos, another average dish. 

Our original waitress was amazing - very attentive, always kept our glasses filled with soda (and even replaced my friend's soda before he complained it was flat)..unfortunately her shift ended midway through our meal and we were passed on to another waiter (who was also behind the bar) who immediately asked if we were ready for the check (although my friends were still eating).  For the next half hour or so we weren't paid attention to!  Service between the two were night and day. I'm going to attribute it to the fact that the kitchen was closed after our original waitress left, but I still would have liked to be checked up on at least once...don't believe that's unreasonable."}
{"text":"How long is a reasonable wait for carry out? 15 minutes?  30? Well, we waited close to an hour for our carryout at Houlihan's.  At no point did someone come over and update us on our order. We were not there during weekend dinner or any particular rush. So what happened?

We placed our order with a bartender who was prompt and made recommendations. His initial friendliness is what left us shocked at what happened next. After sitting and waiting over 30 minutes after paying (and tipping), we still had not received our food. We did not even given an update on whether our food was coming soon. So we asked another bartender what the status of our food was. Turns out the food had been sitting there (not kept warm) for awhile.  Why?  The bartender who took our initial order had left. He did not tell anyone about our carryout order. 

So after this wait, the fish tacos we ordered was inedible (cold) and one order of our fries. Houlihan's was nice enough to remake the fish tacos, but there was no offer to remake any of the other dishes we had. Does no one realize that cold fries means soggy fries? Plus we were driving home! That's why carryout needs to be given to the diners as soon as possible (so you have time to drive home too)!  Anyways, we ended up with remade fish tacos and new soup (not made to order so easy to replace). At this point a simple carryout has translated to an hour wait.

While Mike (the manager) was apologetic about us having to wait. There was no offer of anything else to make up for what happened. We did not ask because at that point we just wanted to get home and eat dinner. He implied that he'll speak with the bartender, but if I do go back and see him. I will not be tipping."}
{"text":"Average dining experience.  

Went with a party of 8 and reserved a private room on a busy Friday night.  The service was average, not too friendly but got the job done in a timely manner.  Drinks took a long time to get to you but we were a little demanding all ordering different specialty drinks. 

A lot  of (maybe too many) options on the menu as we all had a hard time choosing what to order.  
We began sharing an order of their 'shrooms, which are always great.  They seem to keep getting smaller and smaller though.  
For our main course, my sister and I split the southwest chicken wrap and the Prime Steak and Iceberg salad.  The salad was very good but the cut of meat wasn't nearly as big as the image shows above.  It was served with beets, a slice gorgonzola cheese and grilled asparagus.  It was a nice variety of flavors.  The wrap was nothing too exciting.  
All desserts are 'bite size' for $2.99.  Kind of an interesting idea, as you can choose a set of 3 or 5 too and sample everything.  We ordered a few desserts which I didn't have room for.  We also got a complimentary cappuccino cake for my sister's birthday which is delicious therefore I did make room for.  

Between the 8 of us we sampled a lot of beverages.  Many drinks to choose from and prices are listed on the menu which was nice. Had some new drinks with the whipped vodka which were sweet and good, like candy.  Also got a1L pitcher of long islands (which they had about 7 varieties of) for only $10.  Mojitos always a safe bet here; one of the better ones I've had at a chain restaurant.

Accommodating to our large party and no complaints, this place is a safe bet for an average dinner."}
{"text":"I used to love Houlihan's!  They had the BEST ahi tuna salad - with all the changes in the menu - I'm so glad that they left it on, as well as always have amazing drink specials.  
My salad at this location was good and the drink specials were good too.  I was just a little underwhelmed.  I remember it being \"the\" place to be and it just wasn't."}
{"text":"The stuffed mushrooms here are incredible! Also, the Asian lettuce wraps are very good. But my favorite food item on the whole menu are the fish tacos... They are fresh, always done to perfection and comes with chips and salsa that has a little kick.  If you are going for drinks, I recommend the skinny raspberry mojito. It's only like $6 and it is delicious."}
{"text":"We walked into Houlihans for a table of 6 at 5:45pm on a Wednesday. Looking at the restaurant there weren't many people around at all. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes but a manager had to talk to us about exactly how long it would be to be seated. We waited 10 minutes for the manager before we decided to choose another restaurant. We weren't apologized to or tried to convinced to stay. For a struggling restaurant you'd think they'd try harder"}
{"text":"One word: Meh...

I don't really have any reason to ever eat here on purpose because it's so generic, and there are so many awesome, unique places downtown. But I have been here twice in the last month, both times because I was with people who couldn't get into the casino (last week, my friend didn't have her ID and looked under 30, LOL). 

The veggie burger is not good - very doughy and bland...and I bit into a big chunk of hidden hot pepper that ruined my day (my tongue was still burning two hours later). Interestingly, my mini veggie burgers were accompanied by, no joke, 7 shoestring french fries. I didn't really care because after tasting the food, quantity was the least of my concerns.

On the plus side, the fountain soda was really good (making this a 2-star review).

Annoyed that our waiter \"rounded up\" our change to the dollar from about 10 cents for both me and my friend (ie, her bill was, say, $10.13, she paid with a twenty and got $9 back). My bill was similar... Not a big deal, I guess, just annoying that he probably skims money off checks like this all the time to ensure a bigger \"tip\" for lackluster service. Still tipped, just annoyed...

Meh..."}
{"text":"If you like chain sports bars that look like they were built in the 80s you will love this place.  This is not my type of place at all but I was starving and parched, having walked for miles.  I was happy to stop there just the once for a lemonade and some fries.  Both of which were fine, but this is not my sort of place."}
{"text":"Big disappointment... I have eaten at other locations (Hershey, PA and Long Island) and the food was outstanding!!!   I have eaten the same dish at all of them.   Sad!!"}
{"text":"The food and service are both very good. We have eaten here many times and never had a bad meal.
We like the daily specials, they are always something different and delicious."}
{"text":"Favorite place for drinks and appetizers!!!! Bartenders are great and the food always tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free...I'm hyper-sensitive and they were top notch! The Chicken enchilada soup was amazing!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to have dinner here. We often past this restaurant when we visit this mall but never thought to try it.

We know it is a chain but when we arrived we were given a choice of eating either outside or inside. We chose inside since it was extremely hot outside. They had a special offering on the menu so I wanted to try the grilled salmon over quinoa along with edamme peas. My girlfriend settled for steak with a rice blend.

Both of us love French onion soup so our waitress whom we later learned her name was Melissa brought us the best tasting soup we tried. We asked for rolls and immediately got them with our soup.

We both loved our entrees. I found the peas since they were still in their pod a little hard to crunch on but otherwise we were full and very satisfied. We had no room for dessert even though we were offered it.

We found the place wasn't too crowded so it just met our needs. We certainly will return here on a future visit."}
{"text":"Many years ago I was in love with the idea of restaurants like Fridays, Chili's, Applebee's and the like. Not so much today as my tastes in food matures. Besides cooking at home, I'd much rather spend my disposable income on family owned businesses, people who put their heart and souls into their business. 

Houlihan's was never my to go to place, even when I was frequenting these so called casual dining spots. The food was never well done in my opinion. But then again, these restaurants always seemed to copy each other's menus. Houlihan's just never caught their niche. They basically just serve dishes that are nothing special. I've had the salmon, completely under seasoned, overcooked and dry. Served  with green beans and rice. Is that Beaver Cleever's mother cooking back there? It was pretty unremarkable.  

Houlihan's will always be like taking your cousin to the prom. It doesn't excite me at all."}
{"text":"It had been years since coming here, so when the opportunity arose, I took it!  My mother, sister, son and I came here from lunch on a Friday afternoon and were pleasantly greeted and quickly seated!  There weren't packed, but pleasantly full!  Our waitress was extremely friendly, fast and patient with us as we always had questions, needed napkins for my younger son and needed drink refills often.  We never lacked in anything.  Our food was prompt and hot!  Wonderful in look and taste.  WE HAVE NO COMPLAINTS!  The bathrooms were clean and neat.  Service was wonderful.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Do I look electrified?  I should because I was shocked at how much I enjoyed a meal here.

In town for a couple of days and wandered over to Station Square and decided to drop in here for a meal.  I'd eaten here once before and it was unmemorable but figured it was worth another shot.  

Sat at the bar where I received fast and friendly service.  My glass of club soda was never empty, which I appreciated.  I ordered a pasta dish and it came out looking like a Kraft Mac n Cheese reject, but then I tasted it and it was very good.  The sauce was nice and spicy and the chicken was tender and moist.

They talked me into the brownie sundae for dessert and like a strong wind, it blew me away.

Okay, so this isn't fine dining but if the food is good, the service is great and the price is reasonable, then that means four stars in my book."}
{"text":"After Christmas shopping at the mall, hubby and I decided to have dinner here. We were told it's a 10 minute wait, sat down with buzzer, hostess came back and said she has a booth at the bar. Restaurant find appear to be busy. It was almost 7pm when waitress came by. We ordered water and food. Told her we needed time to decide on drinks

About 20 minutes go by, no drink menu. My husband got up and grabbed one from the bar. We decided on drinks but our server did not come back. 30 minutes after our meal was ordered, our server came back and asked how we are doing, as soon as she finished her question, she said she would check on our food. 

Approximately five minutes go by, she comes back and says they need another minute. By this time we were the only ones still sitting on the one side of the bar. We waited another five minutes, waitress walked over to the other side of bar with, I'm assuming food runner and delivered food. By this time we were starving and angry that our drink order wasn't taken and out sandwiches were not done. 

We decided to leave. On our way out, my husband told the hostess he was very updated about the lack of service and we were leaving. She said \"aim sorry, thank you for coming.\" We were shocked at her response. We walked out. Two minutes later my husband furious, decided to call and speak to manager. He called, asked for manager. Placed on hold for a long time. He decided to hang up. We are shocked and disgusted by the lack of service and care. One star was too good for our experience!"}
{"text":"The service here is awful.  Though I can't say it was all bad, our waitress was pretty awesome.  She was on top of her shtuff.  First off, we wanted to sit in the bar Saturday night to watch the Olympics but there was a wedding reception going on.  Weird? Yes, but that's Illinois I guess.  
We waited around for at least five minutes before flagging another server down to finally get a table.  I also gotta say, the drinks here (besides the long islands) are expensive!  They're about twice as expensive as other/nicer Houlihan's I've been to.  It must be because it's connected to the hotel.  
Anyways, the food was hit and miss.  My bf ordered the panko shrimp.  Everything was perfect and delicious except for the coleslaw, which was like shredded cabbage and mayo that had been mixed two seconds before so it wasn't marinated at all.  I had the seared sea scallops.  Sadly, the scallops were more like bay scallops.  Pretty tiny in comparison to the same entree I got at a different location a few days earlier.  At least they were perfectly cooked, since the risotto was a fail.  It was starchy and unappetizing.  
Needless to say, I doubt I will be returning to this location though Houlihan's is one of my favorite restaurant chains."}
{"text":"I feel oddly guilty for saying I'm a fan of a chain, but I liked it here. I used to go here a lot; having had more than a year break, I can say Houlihan's, this location at least, is still serving up consistent food. 

I showed up for Saturday lunch in the early afternoon. When checking in with the hostess I was asked if I was okay with a high top in the bar. The main dinging room and the rest of the bar for that matter was surprisingly full. 

Service and the entire experience really was pretty fast. I just got a soup (French Onion) and salad (House), both of which were good. The House salad wasn't your typical plain side salad - this one had corn in it, which was not overwhelmingly present. 

Before that we started with the White Bean and Artichoke Hummus. It was served with 3 slices of cucumber, carrots, celery and flavorful toasted pita. The hummus had basil oil on it and was scattered on top with kalamata olives.

If I'm back in Southpark Mall around lunch I'll for sure keep this place in mind. Large lunch menu should easily please everyone."}
{"text":"Make sure you order the grease on the side.  

 When I told our (clearly hungover) waitress that my grease-laden sandwich on stale bread was unacceptable, she took it back to the kitchen, where they clearly wiped it off with paper towels and threw it in the microwave before re-serving it to me.  She barely apologized before taking it off the bill.  Classy. 

The rest of my party's food was below average, as well.  

Don't waste your money here. just use the little iHotel vouchers at the coffee shop. It may not be as large a meal, but at least it won't take half an hour for a hungover waitress to bring you coffee."}
{"text":"I've always liked Houlihan's! They have great happy hour specials and we happened to watch the Warriors game along with 1/2 off Houlihan's Long Island's. The wait staff and bartender were super nice. It was a little on the empty side but I still enjoyed the vibe. This is next to the I-Hotel so it's easy to frequent here after a meeting or if you're staying a night."}
{"text":"I stay at the IHotel for business often (bi-weekly) and have had dinner at Houlihan's on many occasions.  This restaurant is very consistent.  I haven't had a bad meal yet.  The filet mignon with mashed potatoes hits the spot on a cold night in U-C.  I'm pretty addicted to their Fat Spaghetti and Potstickers.  Weird combo?  Yes, but I crave them as soon as I check into the hotel.  

The waitstaff is excellent, but a couple of the hostesses could be a tad \"warmer\".  Overall, this is great spot."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Terrible customer service. Stood at bar for seven minutes to pick up order to go. No one manning bar. Several servers passed by; no offer to assist. Chain establishment-typical."}
{"text":"Great happy hour food and drink deals. Even 9-11 on weekends! Good menu with both trendy and traditional items."}
{"text":"Always have had great service! Great food, consistent on refills, and are always willing to help you! I would personally recommend their French onion soup or their teriyaki chicken wings!"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, nice Irish pub. Not really much else to say.
Their dining room overlooks the street, they have a bar that seats a dozen patrons, and more space around the way. Good staple."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Just terrible.

Had dinner here last night with the family.  I had to wait a day to write my review I was so mad when I left this place last night.

Emily S. was our server.  She was a nice girl.  Terrible server.  We were seated in a table near the bar area.  We waited about 10 minutes after we were seated before she came by to get our drink order.  We also ordered their famous Shrooms appetizer.  At this point a couple was seated next to us at a high top.  Emily took care of them as well.  She delivered their drinks before we got ours.  We got our drinks 10 minutes after we ordered them.  So we got our drinks 20 minutes after we sat down.  And after I ate the appetizer that came out well before the drinks.

My wife asked her if she forgot to get her wine?  She said it must be at the bar.  Then came back to our table a few minutes later and said her order was lost.  She wanted to know again what she ordered.

About that time the couple next to us got their dinners.  Before my wife got her wine she ordered before the couple next to us was even seated!

I noticed a manager visiting all of the tables around us.  At this point I couldn't wait to have him come by and talk to our table.

I ordered Jambalaya and asked for the French Onion soup to come out first.  Our dinner came out and everything on my plate was overcooked.  The shrimp was overcooked and hard.  The rice was dry.  The chicken pieces in the rice were dry.  The veggies in the creole sauce were cooked next to nothing.  Then, I had to ask to have the soup taken off the bill that never came.

They took the soup and wine off the bill.  With tax and tip for the 3 of us I still spent over $50.  And the manager never came to our table.  He visited every table in our section except for ours.  And Emily was training someone to be a server here as well.  If she's the best they have.  Wow.

I walked out of this place furious.  I won't be going to back.  Ever.  You couldn't even give me free meals in this place for a year to go back!"}
{"text":"C'mon, Houlihan's.  With a little more effort, you can do it.  

Maybe five or six visits in the past ten years, and again---just like before---I've left dissatisfied.  For me, the food has never been what I'd expect from a restaurant in their affordable TGI Friday's / Applebee's price range.  Basic...uninspired.  Something that your friend---who can't cook, but gives it a try---might serve if you were invited over for dinner.  

This last time was a $10 luncheon special.  The price was right---but it's what I got for the money.  Fried Perch, love that.  But not when it's overdone dry.  Bun was okay, fries, too.  Lettuce, tomato, and onion slices were fresh, but their woeful tartar sauce was nothing but mayo and a few small specks of pickle, mixed together.  Not tartar sauce.  This is probably one of the easiest condiments to make---and have wonderful results every time.  I like a little tartar with fried, but not other fish preparations, so---for a moment---I thought of asking the waitress for the few ingredients I'd need to make my own right there in our cozy booth.  Quickly decided against that---too extreme and too weird.  I could live without it.  Impressive flourishing dining room displays should be reserved for Crepes Suzette or Banana's Foster.  I wouldn't have been as theatrical, but tableside tartar sauce?  Not so much.

A really good thing that Houlihan's is here, though.  I'm sure that the scores of office workers in this same building---and others near-by---appreciate having a welcome diversion from Kentucky Fried Chicken down the block, and McDonald's across the street.  And we can't forget the alcohol---which might be the main attraction for many patrons. Three star food choices just might taste 4 or 5 stars with a side or two of booze.  Could these liquid refreshments be what Houlihan's counts on for repeat business?"}
{"text":"Convenient restaurant to grab a bite while shopping in the area.  Ordered 2 entrees to make use of a coupon out of an entertainment book.  
Ordered the Korean Chicken-marinated chicken breast, gochujang (a Korean hot chili paste)
sauce, charred pineapple brown rice, garlic green beans, pineapple relish, $15.50, and the fish and chips- Samuel Adams batter-fried fish, french fries, dill tartar sauce, malt vinegar and chipotle slaw $13.95.
Korean chicken was the winner for sure.  Great combination of flavors with fresh green beans and pineapple relish.  Had a nice spice to it, but not too hot.  Not sure if this is what \"Korean\" food should taste like as I have not ordered before, but would def try it again.
Advice - pass on the fish and chips though.  Very thick breading that was gummy.  Sent the first order back because it was not crispy in addition to being gummy.  The next batch was crispy, but still gummy.  I think it was due to the batter being way too thick.  Anyway, subbed out the slaw for the garlic green beans which was the star of the plate.  The french fries are the frozen, out of a bag variety.

Server was attentive and helpful."}
