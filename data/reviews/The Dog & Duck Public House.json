{"text":"We've been to the Dog & Duck several times, it's a cute little place.  It seems like an authentic English pub and the service is usually friendly.  My husband LOVES the liver & onions, and the portion is huge.  My experience with the food is that it's just OK. On the last visit I tried the fish & chips (halibut) since this is the house speciality. It was served on a very loose weave basket with checkered paper on top.  After the paper started to disintergrate into my food I told the server and asked for a plate.  She brought me a plate so I had to transfer the food myself while hoping not to wear it.  The fish was good, but not spectacular so I felt that it was a little overpriced at about $18.  I'm sure we will go there again, next time I'll try something else."}
{"text":"Tucked away in an old house on a side street, but near MacLeod Trail and Spiller Road, this English pub has surprisingly good food and generous portions. Had the prime rib special: good value for money, and not overcooked like at many places. Otherwise the bevvies, service and atmosphere are not notable.  The only culinary knock on it is that they have no pudding, or desserts as we Canucks call it."}
{"text":"I enjoy this pub as it usually has one unique beer offering which is currently Fulelrs London Pride. I've eaten here several times however today I had a turkey wrap for the first time. One of the best wraps I;ve ever had. The opposite of what you usually get. Usually there is a lot of lettuce and you have to serach for the meat. This wrap had a lot of turkey and you had to search for the lettuce. Upon reflection lettuce may have been completely absent, I will to return and confirm this."}
{"text":"What a neat hole in the wall! Busy with live music on a Friday but relaxing during the week. Everyone who goes there seems to know each other and everyone gets along. It's primarily a Baby Boomer bar but that doesn't stop us \"kids\" from joining the fun.   That being said, they have some great pub food that range from the traditional irish supper to ethnic fusion. A few things that you need to try are the Cranberry sandwich,  Angus burger, Yummy Guinness soup and most importantly Butter Chicken Poutine!"}
{"text":"I experienced a tortoise pace evening of service at The Dog & Duck Public House on one recent Saturday evening.  I didn't try any of the food, just had drinks, but my friends had a few food items and the comments ranged from okay to terrible.  The main issue for me was the service, as it was super slow, and a bit incompetent as well.  I might try this pub again on a week night in order to try the food, but it would take a lot for me to come back as it is a fair distance from my home."}
{"text":"We had the halibut and chips.Fish was very good.Fries were overcooked and a small portion.They tasted as if the oil had not been changed for a long time.Outside seating on picnic tables was fine.Inside is gritty and uninteresting.Not a fancy pub at all,just rather run down looking.The service was lousy overall.I won't be going back.Calgary has better pubs than this.I thought the prices were high considering the place."}
{"text":"I found this place to attract a \"Niche\" crowd, and if you're one of those regulars the staff seem to be friendly. As it was my first time to visit here, I felt ignored, and staff didn't  like me asking questions about menu &beers on tap. I had the Shepherd's Pie which was SMALL, bland  tasteless. Basically minced beef with no gravy/sauce, a tablespoon of those frozen \"mixed veg\", and plain INSTANT mashed potatoes on top. I paid $7.25 for a pjnt of Big Rock domestic beer. This place is overpriced and they rate themselves highly, but to me it's just a place NOT to go back to !"}
{"text":"This is a great little pub that has pretty good food. I've eaten there several times and have had mostly pizza (i've had other dishes too, but can't remember what I had so won't comment on that). The spicy beef pizza is really good, and the fish n' chips pizza is EXCELLENT. I know it sounds \"weird,\" but you really should try it!  I also like how they have the big pot of soup just chillin' on the side of the room, i don't know if you help yourself but i've always dreamed of doing that LOL.  The only thing that could improve is the beer selection, as they only really have products from the giant national brands (coors, molson, rickards, etc.). Would be nice to see some more micro/craft brews, like The Hop in Brew has."}
{"text":"To be honest, the outside looks a bit sketchy in the dark but it fits with the old English pub decor on the inside. Service is a bit slow and although the meal tasted good, to be honest I felt sick that entire night."}
{"text":"What an awesome little place! This is a house turned into a bar and defiantly my favourite British Pub in the city now!   What makes it so awesome is the d√©cor, ambiance, awesome friendly staff (our waitress sat down beside us at the table and hung out for a few min discussing the menu and all the different options and her top picks; who does that in Calgary these days? So used to 'Earl's like zombie girls' to talk to a waitress with an opinion was a breath of fresh air. No \"well our feature is...\" or \"customers like...\"instead we got real feedback. I love it!)  and a really cool patio and live music.  The menu has some of the best pub fries in the city - perfectly crispy and nicely salted with some other cool British Favourites such as: a Chip Buddy.  I had the Prime Rib Burger + fries and was very happy. This is the same burger as Boston Pizza uses and that is sold at Costco. I forget the company that makes the patty but it tastes amazing.   So check this place out. Come when there is live music too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great (and interesting) atmosphere.  The had a prime rib and mash potatoes special that was fantastic.  Will definitely be back, and I will bring friends."}
{"text":"Halibut and chips $19. Hmmm a little steep for pub food  Halibut pieces smaller than most places who stretch the look with batter. This was all fish  Tasted a little fishy , ie past best before but vinegar lemon and ketchup covered  Fries very crunchy, oil a little old, cole slaw sweet  A solid 3"}
{"text":"This is a good, local dive bar. On Saturday nights, local bands can come on and play for a pretty empty house. It's probably a great place to just try out some new material or get use to standing up in front of a mic.   Anyway, the food is pretty good. There is your typical pub fare (wings, ribs, fish and chips, etc.) that is reasonably priced ($9-$14 range). There is a good number of beers, local and imported, on tap although the guiness I had was pretty terrible. (It tasted like there was something wrong with the keg.) However, I can't judge a place too badly on that as the other beers (local) seemed to come out fine.  Honestly, the place isn't anything remarkable but if you live in the area and are looking for a good place to be a regular then this seems like a great spot for you. There are darts, a pool table, booths, and tons of table seating so this would be a great place to unwind without dealing with numerous crowds. Honestly, we went because we were in the area and wanted a drink and didn't want a crowd. Dog and Duck satisfied all of those requirements."}
{"text":"I loved this place (and it definitely felt like my new spot) from the second I walked in. Great band was playing, crowd was small but welcoming, and the waitress was awesome!! My friends and I already plan on making this our 'go to' for day (and night) beers.   Atmosphere: cute little pub with a rustic touch  Food: damn good. Perfect British Pub fair and HELLO! Tempura banana peppers? YES PLEASE. I'm drooling just thinking about it.  Drinks: average prices, great selection and even their own Cider! Made by Big Rock-correct me if I'm wrong :)  I was himming and hawing about writing a review, as I want this place all to myself, but it's too good not to shout out!"}
{"text":"Dog and Duck is a place where customers are treated at the staff discretion.  Which means, if for some reasons you aren't liked, you should get out.  I have been to Dog and Duck six times because it is close to the place where I stay during this business travel, got my food 5 times out of 6, and received anything that looks like a friendly and polite service only 3 times out of 6.  Today I literally haven't got any food - the server was passing by my table dozen of times, disregarding any attempts to order.  Ok guys, so you give me a finger - I give you a finger, that's only fair. I thought that after leaving you honest 15% tip and being nice to you every time before I earned a chance to get some food in the evening, but if that's too much to ask, then ok - no more visits to Dog and Duck, I got it.  Food is good, by the way - and not expensive. The place is old, but it actually helps. Public is mostly locals, of all types common for the Chinook area residents.  Despite my ugly experience, you may wish to give this place a try - who knows, maybe you'd be lucky? That's a good pub after all, just not everyone is welcome..."}
