{"text":"The new owners don't know how to make general toa chicken.

They didn't make it crispy and she started arguing that at least it is chicken and the chef said it went soggy in the sauce.  Both untrue. 

They wouldn't exchange or give a refund.  I even told them that I come there all the time.  Never again."}
{"text":"Very budget friendly westernized Chinese food. 

Food tastes okay with big portions. Meat/vegetable selection is limited. Nothing to blow your mind but is good to satiate hunger and price is very reasonable. You get free candies with your purchase as well.

Service is alright. People are friendly but the lady seems to have little grasp of English.

 There is better choices in Village By The Grange."}
{"text":"This place is inexpensive, service is friendly. and it's pretty yummy."}
{"text":"It's cheap, greasy food court Chinese food.  I think my BBQ pork with noodles and 'salad' was $5.

However, even at this price point -- pretty horrible food.  BBQ pork was thinly sliced, noodles were limp and the 'salad' was haphazardly chopped into huge chunks of lettuce and carrots.

It's decent if you're a broke student, but I would recommend staying away."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff. Asked a simple question about the special. Staff ignored me and helped the person behind me. I used to come here years ago and the menu was different and the service was much better. Not sure what happened. If you like terrible and rude service this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Located in the food court of Village by the Grange

Service: one person hot food counter fast food service (and another person cooking in the back kitchen), efficient when not busy, could be a bit of wait during busy meal hours.

Food: I've been coming here often recently for a quick work lunch. It's definitely cheaper than most fast Chinese food places outside this food court as everything is pretty cheap here. Limited varieties of meat (mostly pork, some chicken, 1 fish), always 3 types of vegetarian options.

Knowing what kind of food it serves, you can't complain much for the price, pretty mediocre quality.

Overall: if you are craving for the typical fast chinese food, this will do, and a great quick lunch spot with many other options around. If you are looking for great gourmet chinese food, this is definitely not the place.

P.S. they charge an extra of 25 cents if you pay by card, so have cash!"}
{"text":"For a filling meal priced at 5 dollars, you can't really have high demands. I like that their batter is not super thick like how it is at some fast food places. The amount of chicken is good for general tso. The value is good for a cheap meal."}
{"text":"Other reviewers have noted \"it's cheap, greasy food court Chinese food\". They couldn't be more right, and I dig them for it. 

Located in what I now consider to be the greatest food court in Toronto, Tasty Chinese Food shares its name with a late, lamented sit-down joint that used to be near my hood. Often, my pregnant wife and I would visit that restaurant to satisfy cravings for moo shu or hot and sour soup; leaving with full bellies and relatively full wallets. 

I don't know if this food court stall has the same owners (in fact, I doubt it), but points for random nostalgia. 

Clearly, value is the draw here. Despite a wide variety of options I keep coming back to the steam table for the $5 special. One meat, one veg, one carb. If I felt flush I might compliment it with a slightly underdone spring roll or a bowl of \"spicy\" and sour soup (why \"spicy\" instead of \"hot\", I have no idea). Of course, if I felt flush I wouldn't be slumming it in the OCAD food court. Also, I might explode. Seriously. They pile the tray pretty darned high here. 

I have a rule at places like Tasty. Given the choice between fried rice (which is inherently a by-product, if yummy), or noodles, I go for noodles. Lo mein has a good chew and pleasantly crisp assortment of veggies, but I opt for Singapore. The veg therein are limited to onion, cabbage, carrot and the occasional sprout but the curry sauce that stains it is pleasant, and a good foil for whatever else I pile on. 

Proteins vary, but highlights include barbecue pork, a fried pork dish featuring crispy strips tossed with carrot and celery (which is really really good stir fried and spiced generously), capable General Tsao and spicy tofu. 

Vegetable options include standard-issue mixed veg, green beans, and my recommendation-sticky-sweet-spicy eggplant, cooked until it's creamy. It's a great foil for anything else you can think of. If the plate weren't already inexpensive, I'd just get an order of that over steamed rice. 

Hmmmmm for under $4, that might be lunch tomorrow..."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly not that bad.

Their BBQ pork with veggies combo is pretty good in my opinion.  When the lady asks if you want BBQ sauce on your pork, definitely accept, it is delicious!  It comes in at just around $5 and is more than enough food to fill you up for lunch.

Unlike many of the other restaurants in the food court, they have good value regardless of if you are a student or not, which is a nice touch.

Really nothing mind blowing here, but if you aren't sure which place to go to when at this food court and you enjoy Chinese then this place is a decent option.  It is also really cheap, in case your wallet took a big hit from last night's bar hopping."}
{"text":"This generically-named spot in the Village by the Grange food court is A-OK. A two item combo is a little over $6 and they stuff that little styro container silly. It's more food than you can shake a stick at. (Go on, try it.) They have your expected standard ersatz-Sino fast food fare here: chicken balls, sweet and sour pork, spring rolls, sesame chicken, beef and vegetables, and a surprisingly decent BBQ pork.

I grew up on great food court stuff like this, so I have a soft spot for the Chinese grease-a-thon offered here. But for a discount (and hefty) portion at lunch time, you could do worse.

Try the broad noodles.

Obligatory Title Pun: I couldn't possibly.

Menu Readability: TYPICAL.

Need to mention: They have debit and credit and don't charge extra for it.

What this place teaches me about myself:"}
{"text":"Unbelievably inexpensive - you can get a meal here for less than $4. I was a tad disappointed, though, by the quality of the food. Food court Chinese isn't necessarily bad (Modern Wok does it reasonably well) - though Tasty Chinese doesn't buck the trend of standard, greasy, Americanized Chinese fare. Village by the Grange is filled with other gems - avoid, unless you absolutely must have Chinese food."}
