{"text":"Pizza is consistently great! I personally love the New York style, it's as close as it gets outside of NYC. Would've given five stars but delivery was 1.5 hours after promising 40 minutes. Pizza was cold and over cooked. Not typical for them but will not have it delivered in the future"}
{"text":"States their delivery driver went home sick. And offered sub par customer service. Also their \"large\" pizza is pathetic for the cost. Their large is comparable to other places medium. 

Pizza tastes OK. Crust could be more flavorful. Better than the bigger chains but value is questionable comparatively."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious.  The crust was not too thick or thin,  and the amount of cheese and sauce was perfect.   The large is smaller than other places, though."}
{"text":"My family has been ordering pizza from this place for at least 15 years. It really is consistently delicious. Big fan of the square cut as well. The wings are also really good. Cooked properly, unlike a lot of places where the wings are usually mushy and undercooked. They're are a lot of crappy pizza places in the area, but this is NOT one of them."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good.  Sausage is a little spicy for my liking.  Sauce is good and the square style is unique.  Always ready quick and on time.  Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Very tasty Sicilian style pizza! I would order from this mom and pop take out place any day rather than any other mass marketed pizza chain.  I just learned there are a few locations around town but I would not consider it a \"chain\".  The sauce has a touch of sweetness to it, delicious!"}
{"text":"I really didn't feel welcomed when I came into the shop. The employee gave me very little eye contact. 

The price for a large is outrageous! They charge $12 for one topping pizza. I can get so much more from larger chain like pizza hut or Marco's. 

The place is fairly clean."}
{"text":"First time ever going to this Pizza Place, Must say I loved the Pizza, The Crust was Perfect and the sauce was tangy and sweet but very very good. Think I found my NEW pizza Place!!"}
{"text":"Just recieved my Giuseppe's delivery calzone 5 minutes ago.
Absolute garbage.
The calzone I thought I was getting shown on their site turned out looking like a cheap quesadilla.

See for yourself."}
{"text":"Like the pizza but the have that the deliver but when we call the delivery guys car always seems to be broke down. Don't have delivery on your site if you don't really deliver."}
{"text":"Full disclosure- I grew up on this pizza...  It's a small  mom and pop, carry out only pizzeria.  They consistently make a good Sicilian type pizza (square shape).  The pizza/slices are not very big.  A family of four may want to order one large and one small pizza.  They now have \"New York\" style pizza on the menu, but I have yet to try it.  The subs are good but nothing special.  My favorite topping is here is sausage!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! The people who work there are great and the food is amazing. Subs, pizza, salads - everything is made fresh and tastes amazing."}
{"text":"I always loved their food here. Years ago I worked near by and we would all order from them all the time. I am taking a friend of mine to get the veggie supreme and will get one for myself too! Everything that I had ever tried was delicious."}
{"text":"Ok.....this is our 3rd pizza. Dang it's good. I walked in and saw a mature woman sitting in a chair....hmmmm...what? The customer came in to order as she forgot her phone so while she waited, they offered her a chair to wait. Isn't that sweet??? If the owner is taking care of his clients this way, he's caring for everyone!
We just moved here in Dec so we have no clue as to reputations of location businesses so this review is completely genuine. 
I see us being a lifetime client!"}
{"text":"LOVE the pizza! Order pizza every Friday night. Staff and service is quick and courteous. The Margarita pizza is delicious and the gluten-free pizza crust is excellent too."}
{"text":"We ordered two half sheets & a small pizza to bring to a birthday party being held at a nearby plaza, and what a hit they were! Kids ate it all up, saying how delicious it was, and our order was hot and ready for pick-up at the exact time we specified. Very impressed with the outstanding food & service here and would highly recommend to anyone!!"}
{"text":"We specifically look for certain items on a pizza menu. One being a Margarita Pizza. Fresh Mozzarella, Fresh Ricotta Cheese, Fresh Basil, Fresh Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Romano Cheese sprinkled last. This was the description on the menu. All we got was an uncooked doughy pizza, with processed Mozzarella Cheese, dried basil, not fresh, NO RICOTTA Cheese & no Romano Cheese, sliced Tomatoes that were runny. Therefore; No taste at all. A make shift staff without hairnets & no one wearing hand gloves.A BIG disappointment!!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Dough made fresh every morning by the best pizza maker around, Eugene. 
Best pizza. best subs. best food."}
{"text":"This is the mayfield hts location Very unpleasant, this is the nastiest owner I have never seen, doesn't matter if this food is good or bad. Service and owner is terrible, I used to eat there often. Many mistakes on orders have been made and owner Tony will not own up to his mistake. HOW IS THIS MAN STILL IN BUSINESS!! I would give this -0 stars but It doesn't offer it. I have had hair in my food, and still he refused to refund my money or make me another pizza. Tony do you know the meaning of customer service? Do you remember the people, your customers are what kept you in business, at this rate you are going to lose all your business , as you should."}
