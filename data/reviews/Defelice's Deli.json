{"text":"This place has good food, but the service is the worst I have ever experienced, not only at a restaurant; but anywhere. I live near this deli and have wanted to try it for sometime... well I went and I will not go back. I arrived and not only was I ignored, but the guy standing behind me in line had his order taken ahead of me, literally while talking over my head. Finally I got the lady taking orders to acknowledge me and was told it would be 30 minutes for any sandwich, unless I got the special (fish or ribs), which would \"be fast\". We'll I didn't really want the special, but I also didn't want to wait 30 minutes for a turkey club, so I ordered the fish sandwich. During my 45 minute \"fast\" wait for my fish sandwich, I heard the lady drop the F bomb twice, say \"holy shit I wish people would stop ordering by phone\" (and throw the phone down) and shove a guy his meal with the parting words of \"Jesus Christ here's your order\". The guys manning the grill seemed like good guys, their only mistake is not firing the lady handeling the orders. When they saw me waiting after about 30 minutes, one said \"that guy has been waiting forever, what was his order\". The rude order taker responds with \"he can wait, you have to take orders in which they come\". 

Okay, in any other situation I would have agreed with this wack job, but the only reason I ordered the special was so I didn't have to wait. I actually think my blood pressure went up just watching this crazed lunatic run around like a chicken with her head cut off. 

Once my order FINALLY was ready, the apologetic cook tried to lend a hand and get the condiments for my meal while she quickly jumped down his throat for \"trying to mess up her system\". They actually told me as I left that I should come at 10:30 next time because they won't be as busy. I wanted to that is because nobody eats lunch at 10:30!

The food actually ended up being very good, however I will not return simply due to the horrible experience. 5 stars for food and negative 4 for the worst service I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian subs and home made soup.  Everything is home made and subs are huge.

Only complaint is the they do not have regular hours.  I would eat there more often, but half the time it is closed."}
{"text":"The woman giving me a to-go order scratched her nose and ass crack in shorts as I was getting my food. Didn't care that I was standing right at the counter. I've been to street food stands in third world countries and I have never seen that.

I didn't eat the sandwich but for what its worth it had more oil drenched on it than the deepwater horizon."}
{"text":"I went for lunch to this friendly lunch counter. You can take your food to go or eat in their dining room. 

I had soup and one of their subs. The half sandwich was close to 10\". 

The wedding soup was a little different than usual, but I really enjoyed it. 

I saw them dishing up some pierogies and they will definitely be the reason for a return visit. 

The guy who was cooking went out of his way to welcome us and point out a few menu items. 

Parking is a bit limited"}
{"text":"Finally stopped into this place. Glad I did!  Their menu was way more than I expected. We had a spicy Italian and deluxe steak. Both really good quality and flavor.  We also had an order of fresh cut fries.  They were great!  I have never had such crispy fresh cut fries!  I'm looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"Even in Italy, people would be impressed by the quality of their Italian food.  My family loves the subs and every pasta dish I've tried here is amazing!  While not a classically Italian food, their pierogi is the best I've ever tasted.  If I could only eat at one place for the rest of my life, Defelice's Deli would be that place."}
{"text":"Ordered the catering option from Defelice's Deli in March for a luncheon in South Fayette. They delivered the food, set it up, and had everything ready when the group of 40 people arrived at the venue. Presentation was great, the gnocchi is fantastic and highly recommended, the entire pan was empty.  Ron is a pleasure to work with and I would use them again."}
