{"text":"Poutine to die for!  Excellent pomme frite, gravy & cheese curds from top to bottom, no need to ask for extra sauce.  The pork was moist & tender.  Almost didn't need a drink from the salivating.  Not a fan of the no English but we were with a bi-lingual friend so that worked out."}
{"text":"La poutine est délicieuse!! Surtout celle aux côtes levées faut vraiment y aller très bon petit resto mais très occupé sur l'heure du midi"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The shop is small, cute and really fun. There is a school bus like wall between the entrance and place you order. The place I sat down reminded me of a old car cushion!

Like the previous reviewer said, there is no English translation on the menu board and it was a little difficult for us! We got it figured out quickly and ordered! He got a burger and a mini poutine while I got pulled pork poutine. Holy moly, it was amazing. The pulled pork was tender, flavorful and really added a lot to the poutine. Hubby wasn't a fan of the burger and agreed with a statement I had made earlier in the trip about how the ketchup in canada was quite a bit sweeter than the ketchup in the states. 

This stop was actually one of my favorite things we did on our trip! I'm happy to have found it."}
