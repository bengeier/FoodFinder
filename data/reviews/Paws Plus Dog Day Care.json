{"text":"Original Review: Ordered some dog treats online. Got a confirmation email and a tracking number. Never shipped. Tried emailing and calling multiple times. No answer. Had to file a dispute with the CC company to get the $$ back. Avoid!  Updated: Still Avoid - this vendor is a troll. Next stop BBB. How to make a customer livid: Not answer emails or phone calls.  Then post redacted personal details in a response to a negative review. Classy. Real classy.  The fact that people move around this country and not update social media profiles somehow eluded this vendor. If you would like to respond, please do so without posting my redacted details.  Otherwise, personal message or a REPLY TO MY EMAIL OR A PHONE CALL will do."}
{"text":"No communication on online orders. Called a few times,  emailed,  nothing. Been two weeks since online order and it seems we will be needing to go through our bank for a refund. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"Contrary to Yelp this place is open Sundays. So nice and clean with a helpful gal. Prices better than many plus all the new brands u want to try.  Got several new cans of dog food the boys are going to have fun testing. Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"DO NOT do business with this company. I too ordered dog treats online, received an order confirmation and was charged immediately but I never received my order. After multiple attempts to reach this company by phone and email and no response, I've filed a complaint with the BBB. I plan on also disputing the charge with my credit card company."}
{"text":"I placed an order July 22, 2016. I have spoke to one person at the beginning of August, my order was suppose to have shipped and delivered to me by Wednesday, August 10, 2016. It is not here. I have filled 2 different forms. Called and left messages... I CANNOT GET AHOLD OF ANYONE!!!!! THEY STOLE MY MONEY!!!!! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!"}
{"text":"Can not fulfill orders!  DO NOT ORDER FROM.  I ordered food from the website to be delivered to me on vacation.  There is no estimated shipping date or information - had to call several times to get an answer when the food would ship.  Finally I got a shipping confirmation number that said estimated delivery was Friday.  On Friday I get an update from FedEx that they have CANCELLED my order without notification.  I was in a remote location where I could not buy food for my pet and they cancelled my order on the day it was to be delivered.  Terrible customer service - never order from!!  Can not be trusted."}
{"text":"I love this store!! Wonderful prices and a very helpful staff. I got online and google said the store was closed yesterday, so I called and no one answered . Today it also says on Google its closed?? What is going on?? I buy my dog food there all the time and I really don't want to give anyone else business."}
