{"text":"On Sunday 4/10/16 we purchased a large half plain half sausage pizza. With our coupon the price was reasonable at a little under $12. 
Environment was clean and friendly.
Having a background in pizza I was curious and excited (I live close to the shop) to try this new local pizzeria.
As I entered the shop I noticed the conveyor oven and had to tell myself not to pre-judge as I don't generally care for this method of cooking pizza. To my surprise and delight the folks at Pizza Authority managed to pull it off.
The pizza was excellent. They use a quality Grande cheese and an interesting style of sausage which I found very tasty. The pizza was cooked properly and their homemade sauce was delicious. 
Very glad to have a winner in the neighborhood!
Excellent pie-
Congratulations Pizza Authority! Keep up the good work!
