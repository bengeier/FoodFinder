{"text":"My wife and I needed a break from the outrageous hotel and restaurants cost for lunch, so we decided to try something local! Food was really good and the staff is super friendly, honest and accommodating to menu options! Would recommend this place and will come back next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I can't say enough of this place. I've been here three times and every single time has been exceptional! I try my best to order something different so I can really get a taste of the menu and every time I order a new dish it has always been extremely delicious. If you can, be sure to order your katsu with cheese inside. Ordering it with double cheese is not necessary, one cheese was enough. 

It was also nice that you get a hot little bowl of miso before your order arrives (no limits on how many refills of miso by the way). The best part is that the portion sizes are huge. So I promise you that you will leave full."}
{"text":"Finally, somewhere to satisfy my tonkatsu cravings without having to make the trek downtown!

The meat is fried to perfection and does not taste greasy at all. Each order comes with a generous portion of your chosen sauce for your gigantic pork or chicken cutlet and to soak up with the all-you-can-eat rice. I didn't taste a huge difference between the pork loin and the pork tenders, which is a $1 upgrade, but I highly recommend ordering the Cheese Katsu if it's your cheat day.  I eyed the Double Cheese but wasn't brave enough to try it.  Maybe some day... 

Having tried four of the sauces over several visits, I settled on Sweet Chili as my favourite.  Their curry sauce is decent but lacks the deep flavour of Kaiju's curry and I would go to Mr. Tonkatsu if you crave the original Japanese tonkatsu sauce.  Remember to ask for the sauce on the side for ease of sharing and to keep the meat nice and crispy.

Unfortunately, the Tako Wasabi was way too sweet and contained the kind of low quality seaweed salad usually found at an AYCE sushi restaurant.  It was served with nori strips that are too thin to pick up the octopus.  Based on some of the other comments about their appetizers, I think it'd be a safe bet to skip the apps here and go straight to the tonkatsu. 

The staff was attentive, polite, and quick.  No complaints about the cleanliness aside from the sticky wooden tabletops, which admittedly is a pet peeve of mine.

Like many of the more popular restaurants in the area, this place gets busy at dinner time on weekends.  If you want to try your luck in their tiny parking lot, watch out for the big pot hole as you turn in from Yonge St."}
{"text":"I love Katsuya ~ been here too many times to count, and their carbonara pork cutlet set is the best ! I also like how they cheerfully replenish your rice, salad and soup :)"}
{"text":"Great fried chicken/pork/pork with cheese and cod. Each order comes with miso soup rice and some cabbage with pickled ginger. The price is great for the quality and portions you get. The cabbage is a bit on the plain side but everything else is amazing. Perfectly friend protein portions and good service. I would highly recommend this joint. A must try at least once in your lifetime :)"}
{"text":"What a 5 star experience!!! We were in town for the SEMA show and the manager Jesus made us feel so welcome and took care of us like we were family. Service was excellent, all the staff has amazing personalities and the food is outstanding!!!! I am a sushi fanatic and this is the best crispy rice with spicy tuna I've ever had. We went back 3 times and will certainly return next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Surpringly good, albeit expensive. 

Had a piece of kampachi, the sake made for Katsuya, and the wagyu beef with foie gras.  Beef was EXCELLENT, kampachi was good, sake was above average. 

Walk in and you get what you'd expect.  Fantastic and kind service, fancy atmosphere, and good but small portions (though tasty).  Sushi prices are for single pieces. 

Went in for my birthday month to get credit for my bill.  Otherwise, I wouldn't go back unless I won the lottery."}
{"text":"The best katsu place I've ever been to! The breading is so light and the sauces were amazing. The portion is very large for their price. They refill every him if you want besides the meat. I had my miso soup and pickled radish refilled. We had the curry and carbonara katsu, they were both very good. I would definitely come again to try the other sauces. The service was also very good, the staff were so approachable and attentive."}
{"text":"Got the Spicy White Snow Pork Katsu and was pretty impressed. It's not the most complex dish but it's tasty and they give you quite a large portion for what you're playing. They're also very nice and top up your miso soup constantly.

I'd come again!

Note: Was at the 66 Gerrard location but couldn't find the business."}
{"text":"Amazing! We had the best meal here. Dustin was the best server. Must haves - the crunchy corn roll and my friends loved the one with gold flakes and caviar. The owner even called us a limo back to our hotel."}
{"text":"I would give this place one star, but I know the workers there are simply doing there job.. 

So two stars... I'm giving one star back since I did read the menu, and was cognizant of how overpriced this place is..

 It is really pricey, for pedestrian food.. My girlfriend and I went on Superbowl Sunday just after the game, I asked that we be seated at the Sushi bar. The place was not busy, and only a few tables came in after we were seated (around 7:15)

After awhile I  told my girlfriend we are leaving if someone doesn't take our order.... Since the Sushi chef couldn't be bothered to see we were sitting in front of him... And then someone shows up to take my order....

Service is lacking... this was the first time I have ever sat at a sushi bar, where the  Sushi chef  didn't even acknowledge that someone was there..... not a hello, not a teeny amuse bouche, and then there was the \"wasabi\" bait and switch... I noticed one of the helpers grinding fresh wasabi root,  That gave me pause and optimism that I would have a great memorable sushi dinner.. However, when my sushi was presented to me..it had that rehydrated 
 green powder as an accompaniment

In all I got 8 pieces of sushi and one cocktail... cost $85... and I tip....the waitress and server  just work there, they are not responsible for fustercluck that are celeb restaurants..

So $100 8 pieces of fish, one drink....  I left unsatisfied, Ill never  ever go to one the this Katsuya branded restaurants ever again
..

Given the hype.. restaurants that allege to operate at this level need to get everything right every time... Katsuya Las Vegas fails...


So if you are OK with paying stupid prices for food you can get elsewhere for a lot less go for it,,,"}
{"text":"Blue fin tuna has a great texture and taste -no soy sauce needed for newbies to sushi. Please tell me where this is flown in from?
The bar takes a great approach of spicing things up using muddled Serrano peppers and Nigori sake in a favorite classic sidecar. 
Has a great environment and large selection of cold sake for upcoming 100 degree weather."}
{"text":"Katsuya has very good customer service, they accommodated to what I needed and was very happy to help. The portions were large, you can probably share the katsu with a friend. I recommend this place if you want to try out new ways to eat your katsu ! And they also offer free soups, salad and rice."}
{"text":"Had an AWESOME experience at the bar with Alice and Jose were amazing for social hour!  Best food we have had in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was staying at SLS about a week and a half ago, and was pretty disappointed with the check in and Unami burger.  With the lack of service from Unami burger, I was really skeptical about trying Katsuya.  I was with my mom and a friend walking around the hotel, and decided to try it out.  And, I have to say that I am glad that we did!!!!

We made reservations around 7, upon arriving I could tell that the service would meet my expectations.  When we were seated, Dash was every prompt on filling our glasses and recommending some items on the menu.  Of course he commended the chawanmushi, crab rolls, omakase geta, and the carbonara.  Shortly, after giving us his recommendations our server Jen (?) made sure that we were doing alright with the menu, and suggested that we try the watermelon cucumber mojito.

After letting us decided, we order the slider, omakase geta (which feeds 2-4 people), watermelon cucmber mojito, and a couple of apps that I really can't remember.  First off, the chawanmushi was AMAZING!!!!! I have to say that it is THE BEST that I ever had!!!!! And, the omakase geta was AMAZING as well,  Coming from Hawaii, we know our seafood and Japanese food.  And, I have to say that omakase geta was probable the fresh fish I had in a really long time.  The ama ebi was so sweet!!!

While dining there, Dash and Jen were excellent!!! Their service surpassed all my expectations, and really turned my feelings around about the hotel and their service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Something different yet sooo delicious. The experience gave us a quick taste of Japan. Definitely in love with their food, which was beyond our wildest imagination of what deep fried pork chop could be! We came around 3/4 pm and the restaurant was already packed. I would definitely recommend coming when it's not rushed hours."}
{"text":"It was great! We tried white snow chili sauce pork tender katsu. The sauce was really good. It was packed on a weekday night. Will come back!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 3 years. We love sushi and are very picky. This place is excellent and we are never disappointed. My favorite is the cucumber island and the yummy crunch. My husband loves the mangiere. It is a baked roll. Quite delicious. I would recommend it to anyone I like"}
{"text":"Great fish. Everything else pretty much a disaster. Service juvenile. Hours for follow up on simple asks. Ran out of unfiltered saki at 7:30pm. Give them a year to pull it together."}
{"text":"Always delicious: Crispy rice with spicy tuna, sparkling sake and any cocktail made by Alice and Rashan."}
{"text":"Such a nice restaurant. Loved restaurant we will defiantly come back fore more Cheers."}
{"text":"We've driven past this restaurant a few times, meaning to try it for awhile. Not disappointed! The tonkatsu is nice and crispy without being burnt. Even though the prices are a bit higher than others, the portions are big and tastes great. Would recommend"}
{"text":"SLS is an interesting resort. It's too isolated to be mediocre, but (aside from the veneer of elegance) is rather charmless. This carries over to Katsuya, a Zagat rated sushi joint, with stained wall coverings, and a harried staff unwilling or unable to explain what customers will be served while ordering. 

We had the Chef's Choice sashimi, and each selection was fresh and tasty to be sure. However, do you remember that girl in 6th grade who started wearing blue eyeshadow, before all of the other girls were wearing makeup?  Remember how awesome you thought it was? How chic and adult she looked?  The reality was quite different, and time reveals what a disastrous choice she made (I mean, really, blue eyeshadow?) Katsuya is that girl in restaurant form, and she still hasn't figured out just why people are looking at her with a small smirk.

Katsuya chose trendy over satisfying, and that's just not good enough. I can't believe that we are the only people who've chosen that dish, only to be confronted with a meager selection of food and fake wasabi.  At the very least have a picture for us rubes who aren't used to trendy food selections.  Encourage your staff to ask the question, \"have you ever ordered a dish like this before?  You're getting the chef's best selections, but the portions are modest and intended to be savored, so if you have an appetite you may want to order some rolls.\""}
{"text":"Very tasty. ..
awesome..
good location  

Nice staffs.
I want to recommend others.
weldone.."}
{"text":"We had great food and service....however the place is dirty from the floors to the dust above in the open ceiling to the bathrooms....chairs and table are kind of falling apart.
clean this place up and it could be one of the best."}
{"text":"Just went here over the weekend for the first time. Got rolls and chirashi. Was really good-- legit sushi. Chef Stephen was our sushi chef and he was really friendly, recommended a coupe
Hand rolls for us that we're amazing!"}
{"text":"Love love love. The appetizer portions are a WEE bit bigger here than in Brentwood. Loved the mixed greens, shishito peppers and mochi ice cream. However, was not a fan of the lobster dynamite. Maybe it was just that particular lobster. Loved the ambiance, too!"}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices. Pork tender and loin with sweet garlic chili and curry sauces were great. Carbo udon and chicken thighs were the best."}
{"text":"good spot for sushi with a design decor. Food was good and the cocktails were good. A little over priced for what you get, but it is what you would expect from a hotel restaurant in Vegas. Definitely worht a try if you are down at this end of town."}
{"text":"It was OK. It is tonkatsu with identity crisis. Not typical Japanese style and not typical Korean style either. Portion was ok but I would personally go to Kingyo for tonkatsu during lunch."}
{"text":"Came for an early dinner over the weekend. We ordered two different katsudons and some tempura for two. Our waitress was extremely friendly, and checked up on us frequently. The food came surprisingly fast (around 15 mins), even though the waitress told us it might be a while. The katsudons were rather large, but quite delicious. The miso soup was also refillable, which was a plus. We ended up with some leftovers that we took home for the next day. Overall, the food, service, and atmosphere were great. However, the menu is quite limited, it would be nice if more dish options were added."}
{"text":"Went to dinner on Saturday night. The patrons were young and hip. Ordered the rock shrimp appetizer, hamachi jalapeño, crispy rice (free with coupon from SLS), Katsuya special roll and salmon sashimi. Not to toot my own horn but I feel like I ordered like a boss. Would not change a thing! Had to order a second salmon sashimi because it was too melt in your mouth amazing. Overall the quality of sushi and food here was amazing. Five stars for sure. The service, on the other hand, was lacking. They claimed they didn't have our reservation, but seated the two of us quickly anyways. The waitress hardly ever came by to check on us, had no recommendations and overall was mediocre. It was easy to only have one round at drinks when you only see your waitress once. She also forgot our hamachi order and then charged us for the crispy rice after we gave her the coupon. In conclusion, 5 stars for food, 3 for service and 4 for overall vibe."}
{"text":"The katsu itself was only ok, it got soggy quickly in the sauce, but the meat was tender, not dry. The sauce though... heavenly. Get the garlic chilli one, it's absolutely delicious. I wiped up every drop with the rice. The curry was meh. 
We also got the crab cheese croquette, dressed in tartar sauce and that was really good, too. Light, fluffy, with a gooey cheese centre. The serving was generous as well, I was stuffed from my katsu on its own. 
They have a promotion on right now where if you gram a picture of yourself eating there, they'll give you a free pop. Naturally you'll do it so it's a total steal. 
The wait staff were friendly, quick, and had a sense of humour. Tried their hardest to serve us the fattiest pork in the kitchen when we couldn't tell the difference between loin and tender. 
Student area so this is bang for buck. You get your money's worth. But maybe a bit bougie for a student lunch."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me here and I was instantly hooked.  Big servings, unlimited miso soup, and rice if I'm not mistaken.  I have yet to try the other flavours.  I shall return."}

Alice is an Asian goddess and so easy on the eyes and amazing and Peter is a craftsman...ask him to make you an \"old fashioned\" his way!"}
{"text":"So happy that Katsuya opened up a downtown location! Their 1st location is in North York so when I saw the coming soon sign for this location I was eagerly counting down the days.

The katsu is spot on. The breading was wonderfully crisp, light, and did not feel oily at oil. Our table ordered the pork loin, pork tender, cheese, and double cheese katsus. The pork was juicy and just the right thickness, not too thin and not too thick. The double cheese did feel quite rich so probably would not pair that with the carbonara sauce which is delectably rich as well. We tried the katsuya original, carbonara, garlic chili, and terri mayo sauces. No complaints all around. The shredded cabbage, rice, and soup all have unlimited refills.

Service was great. The two servers were patient with explaining their promotion and answering any other questions that we had."}
{"text":"The fish at Katsuya SLS is not only some of the freshest fish you can get, but without a doubt the highest quality. Do not let price deter you, every bite is worth every penny, over and over again. Stephan, the sushi chef is not only kind and friendly, but so knowledgeable with fish. My two girl friends and I had an amazing experience. And we have our server Ashley and our sushi chef Stephan to thank for a happy and delicious dinner.  It will be impossible to be pleased with sushi anywhere else. If you appreciate flavor,  please try this sushi for your own good."}
{"text":"got the sweet chilli katsu, can definitely taste the korean japanese fusion in the sauce
wonderful service, wonderful food
will definitely come back :3"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my friends recently and the customer service was awesome! Waitresses were super friendly and always checked up on us to see if we needed anything. The restaurant is small but a has a really nice decor and good place to socialize with friends. The food was super delicious and will definitely be going back again soon."}
{"text":"I've been here two times, the food and service is very good. I love the curry pork tender rice and this time I ordered the tako wasabi. The seaweeds are a bit small hope they can change it to a bigger size."}
{"text":"Good sized portions, yummy food. Couldn't ask for anything more!

Tried the curry, sweet and spicy, spicy and garlic, and the carbonara sauces. I liked the curry and sweet and spicy the best. 

Free refills of salad and rice are an added bonus."}
{"text":"We dined on August 28th; shortly after the SLS grand opening! It was our anniversary and we love trying new places, so why not Katsuya. Upon being seated the hostess wished us a happy anniversary, and so did our server Jennifer when she greeted us. We appreciated that. We already knew we wanted to do some sort of omakase or tasting menu. Jennifer suggested the Omakase Geta (pictured) and we were very pleased with her selection. We also ordered a wagyu foie gras (not sure if its the exact name on the menu but it is also pictured)To our surprise they ran very smoothly seeing as they just opened. Everyone seemed to pride themselves on perfection and being happy to be there. The omakase geta (serves 2-4) filled us up so we didnt have space for any other plates off the robata or hot kitchen, but thats okay we will be back. We also got the omakase desert which was very tasty. I believe the yuzu cheesecake was our favorite!"}
{"text":"Nice katsu place to try out!!! The Carbonara chicken tasted good! And the service was very good too. Free refill of miso soup, rice and salad!!"}
{"text":"Price is a bit high for lunch, but the portions are big and food is good. They don't take credit cards (cash or debit only) which is what is keeping me from visiting them again for lunch. Overall a good experience but I wasn't wowed."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas I come at least once depending on the length of my stay. 100x better than the one in Miami."}
{"text":"Went here for my friends birthday.  
wagyu fried rice and wafu carbonara were to Die for!  And the sushi platter we had was fresh and beautiful presentation.   
Dash was our server/ runner and he was awesome.  He knew all the best dishes to order and was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Always came to check on us and see how everything was.  He should get a raise!_
One thing I didn't like tho was the chairs...they were cold and hard and uncomfortable"}
{"text":"We went to Katsuya for my boyfriends birthday and the atmosphere and service was amazing!! We stopped off at the bar first for drinks and Alice and Chelsea were GREAT! I loved the Katsuya fresh and had at least 4 

Our server was Kenny and he was outstanding! It was MY first time there so he was very patient and helpful in making sure we ordered the best of the best! 

I will definitely be going back for the octopus carpaccio & wagyu foie gras!!"}
{"text":"The one of the best tonkatsu place I've ever been to! Very tender meat, definitely recommend getting the cheese katsu. Theres a good selection for sauces and the portion size is very big so its worth the price."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Wonderful presentation, and friendly waiter with a killer Stache. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Our regular go to place for comfort Japanese food within our group. You can never go wrong with donkatsu for any occassion. Quality of food and service never disappoints. 

Pro tip - AYCE rice, salad, and soup"}
{"text":"I loved my experience here. Our waitress was amazing and had a ton of knowledge about the menu. We had a little bit of everything. The chicken and corn from the robata grill were exceptionally good considering I would think of this place more for its sushi and seafood options. The sushi rolls were really good as well and tasted fresh. The double hibachi roll was my favorite! We also got the Sahara, Tuna Tataki and Lobster rolls, I would recommend all of them. I had eaten at two places at SLS previously (the pizza place and The Griddle Cafe) and was super disappointed but Katsuya made up for that."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant in the SLS. Loved the crispy rice spicy tuna and the baked lobster roll. Sushi chef was great and service was good."}
{"text":"Best meal we've eaten! The Brussels sprouts, sashimi omakase and spicy tuna crispy rice were our favorites!"}
{"text":"Emily was fantastic! We got basically every roll on the menu and they were all totally solid. We live in San Francisco so it was refreshing to get great sushi outside the bay. Emily had good recommendations and was charming throughout our meal. Next time we're in Vegas we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic overall experience @ Katsuya! It beats Katsuya in Hollywood and Brentwood with the amazing Brussel sprouts and mushroom bop! And of course there's still the old must have-crispy rice with spicy tuna!  Best of all was service by Matt- best server and new friend!! I will be back and will tell all my friends!"}
{"text":"This is a tonkatsu place that serves Japanese/Korean style chicken or pork \"schnitzels.\" I went on a Sunday around lunch and was seated right away, as there weren't too much people. 

Honestly, I was disappointed with the food quality of this restaurant. It just didn't taste good although on photos it looks super appetizing.  We ordered the carbonara chicken katsu and the spicy garlic chicken katsu. 

The carbonara chicken katsu tasted very soggy and the sauce tasted a bit unfresh, like when warm milk is left for a long time and it tastes a bit like dirty socks afterwards. The spicy garlic katsu was better, but even then, the chicken katsu was just soggy :/

The service was good and I appreciated the atmosphere. But overall, I don't think I would come back here, there are other better katsu places around the city."}
{"text":"5/5

This is the best katsu I have ever had in my life.  I have been to Katsuya quite a few times(mostly at their Yonge/Steeles location) and the taste and quality has been consistently top notch.

For first timers, I would recommend the Original Japanese Katsu section.


This time at this location we ordered:

-Original Japanese Katsu: Pork Tender Katsu($12.50): A very generous portion of pork tender, crispy on the outside and so tender on the inside.
-Original Fish Katsu ($13.50):  Again, crispy on the outside and flaky inside.  Amazing.

Both come with unlimited(all you can eat/drink) cabbage, miso soup, and rice.

This place also takes credit card as payment(unlike the Yonge/Steeles location.

This is a must go in Toronto! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I like the fact that they focus on Katsu and not spreading themselves thinly by having too many things on the menu. If you are looking for a good katsu/cutlet dish, this is the place you want to come. As simple as that. Good service, nice ambiance, good food!"}
{"text":"I ended up dining here 3 nights out of my seven night stay at SLS Las Vegas so that alone probably says something lol. Being a cheapo and not having any dates/guests to entertain, I stuck to the happy hour (5-7p) and tried the crispy rice spicy tuna ($10), nigiri sampler ($10), california roll ($5), and spicy tuna roll ($7). All good stuff. I'd also recommend the Coedo on draft (not a happy hour special), but certain cocktails, beer, and well drinks would run $6-7. The service was great, with attentive staff. Even got to know the manager (who rotates between all the restaurants in the SLS) and he was very personable."}
{"text":"Matt our server was awesome best server we have had out whole trip.. The food was amazing as well"}
{"text":"Super. Nice place to eat specially all the katsu!!! 
Will come back for sure
Love the katsu here 
Just like back in Japan"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant, great food, attentive service. The busser Tirso was always spot on; a really nice genuine guy. We kept coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food! 
Sashimi and wagyu all you want!
Great cocktails!
Amazing wait staff!
And music gets you warmed up for the club!"}
{"text":"On my recent business trip to Las Vegas I decided to stop by Katsura for some happy hour. There was an excellent variety of appetizers, rolls, and sushi to choose from, complimented by their delicious drinks. The Brussels sprouts were a definite stand out with the albacore crispy onion being a close second. My bartenders Alice and Jose were very knowledgeable and friendly; all while making great suggestions like their new grapefruit IPA and apple cobbler. The whole experience made for a perfect way to wind down after a long day of meeting and seminars."}
{"text":"OMG...best sushi in Las Vegas!  If you have not been here you have to go.  Food is delicious, ambiance is fabulous and service is great.   We love Katsuya in LA and Katsuya in Vegas is just as good."}
{"text":"Best katsu restaurant in Toronto! The food here is just absolutely delicious, and I was really impressed their amazing service. 
What I tried was chilli garlic katsu with double cheese, which had so much cheese inside with crispy bread crumbs. Portions are really big and the prices are reasonable. I strongly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The sushi quality and creativeness was top notch!  Highly recommend eating here.   Service was great as well.  If you go during their \"social\" hours you can save $$$."}
{"text":"Cheese crabmeat croquette is great!!
The spicy garlic pork tender is a bit too spicy.. 
The staff is super considerate and we were offered soft drinks and hot green tea on the house!!!"}
{"text":"We tried the deep fried fresh oyster, Katsuya original pork loin katsu and Japanese pork tender katus. They all taste good, and the pork were tender and moist. The cabbage salad was Japanese style. The sauces were flavourful. We will come back again. There is free parking by the way."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the portion is a good size. Definitely filling. The service was also really friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best restaurants in town! This place never lets me down every time I visit, in terms of quality, quantity, and service. It was my friend's birthday this time and they gave us free appetizers and drinks on the house and even played the birthday song for her (probably cause it wasn't too busy?). I could feel that they care so much about the food and service their customers receive. I definitely leave full and happy every visit.

5/5 for food. I love how you have such a wide selection of tonkatsu sauces, toppings, and meat. Even the appetizers and karaage chicken are delicious, worth every penny. They give three sauces for karaage now, and I heard they even make all their sauces, panko (breadcrumbs), pickles freshly in house. Although the rice, salad, and soup portions seem a bit small sometimes, they give free refills! 

4.5/5 for service and atmosphere. The servers always check if I need anything in time, and are always so cheerful and caring. Pretty relaxed atmosphere at off-peak hours so it's good for casual dining, and they change up the mood after sunset (with louder music and dimmed lighting) which makes it a good place for light drinking too. 

Tips:
-cash and debit only
-more parking at the side and rear of the building"}
{"text":"So I was pretty disappointed with the food. The katsu was just so-so. The batter is a bit heavy and nothing like what you would find in Japan, and I used to Iive there, so I've eaten my share of katsu!

The ritual of crushing the sesames and making your sauce isnt done here. They also do not offer you extra rice or extra shredded cabbage. The katsu sauce had a very strange taste to it as well. 

Alcohol list was tiny... Only Kirin and Sapporo... No ????or anything special. There wasn't a wait for a table at 7pm (note they do not take reservations on the weekend) and it wasn't very busy. I had great company with me so the two of us were there for 3 hours and they didn't rush us out at all which was very Japanese and I really appreciated that. In that respect, ONLY, is similar to Japan. It looks like it's run by Japanese as I spoke to the waiters in Japanese.

All in all there's a much better one downtown (Mr Tonkatsu) so don't waste your time coming here."}
{"text":"We frequent their North York location and welcome their addition to the downtown Ryerson neighborhood. 

Came here shortly before 6 pm on Friday and the place was already 90% full. Reservations recommended for larger groups.

Check into Yelp for a free pop.  And post a review for a $5 coupon for your next visit.  

Ordered Katsuya Original fish katsu ($14.50) and pork loin katsu ($12.50).  Similar huge portions as their North York location.  Service is 10x better here though. 

I don't mind my katsu saucy, but if you don't like the sauce to make it soggy, then ask for it on the side.  Miso soup, salad and rice come with free refills.  Come hungry!"}
{"text":"While fairly pricey (13-16cad) Katsuya offers top quality katsu cuisine. With the Carbonara Cheese Pork katsu being their most well cooked ( and presented) dish. I had the sweet chili katsu rice which is also superb.

Regardless of whether you are bringing your first date, having a small family gathering or just wishing to find a ppace to catch up with old friends, Katsuya offers a fine environment along with top quality japanese cuisine for you and your close ones to enjoy."}
{"text":"Had double cheese pork katsu. Great food and nice sauce that comes along with it. Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb, must go for social hour.  The double hamachi and corn crunch rolls are my fav!"}
{"text":"The service was nice at this place. Me and a girlfriend went during happy hour. Prices were decent kind of expensive, regular price is definitely  expensive. atmosphere was nice. We had about five happy hour orders and each one of them was really good especially the Rock'n shrimp. I would return back to this place but I would definitely go during happy hour."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best place for katsu in Toronto. This is already my second visit in the same week! The pork loin is so juicy and tender. The panko is so fluffy, light and crispy. The original sauce balances out the rich flavour of the meat so perfectly. The cabbage salad on the side is so refreshing and fresh that I actually finish all of it. My boyfriend has the carbonara katsu. The sauce is very creamy and rich, but it has a kick to it. Watch out for the unexpected chili flakes!"}
{"text":"We tried the fish katsu and tonkatsu in original sauce and curry. The original sauce is interesting but my personal preferences is no sauce. Overall, it's a great lunch spot. 

I would add that when ordering your dish, make sure the salad is in a separate bowl or else the salad dressing will spill over to your rice."}
{"text":"Natasha served us such a great meal, not really a meal but an experience. Living in Manhattan I've been to some of the best sushi restaurants in the world and this has topped all of them. Inside the SLS Hotel you will find this gem of a sushi restaurant. The fish is exquisite and super fresh. The Spanish mackerel was the best I've had. Daniel, our sushi chef, prepared us a halibut meal garnished in 24k gold flakes that was the most tender sashimi. Definitely don't pass this place up, this will be your best sushi experience in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best thing to ever strike my taste buds! The staff were very professional,  swift service, and welcoming attitude. Only one word describes the food, \"Phenomenal!\" If you're in Vegas and looking for the best dining experience, look no further! Thank you again for such an experience Katsuya! Looking forward to our next encounter"}
{"text":"Lots of flavors of katsu. Like the garlic chili pork tender katsu. The pork tender is super soft and well cooked. Yummy but the size is a little bit too much for girls. Friendly for hungry guys
Nice place for gathering~"}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious food. The portions are huge with unlimited rice and cabbage salad!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience bringing clients here. Our waitress Natosha steered us in the direction of all the really good food and Saki we were looking for. She seemed to know the menu well and heard what we wanted. The Rock Nigori unfiltered Sake was a real crowd pleaser x2. Glad we listened. She also recommended the Wagyu Rib Eye.. Holy Heaven, we ordered another for dessert. All our sushi was top notch. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food came very fast and hot. Large portions, worth every penny. Very crunchy and crispy. Service was amazing. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well this is a mind blowing experience. I love las vegas and its sushi spots.  Especially when you get of a long night of running a restaurant and you just want to have a bite and a drink with some friends at goyemon. But this place trumps blue ribbon, social house and kumi. It's not the all you can eat vegas tradition but even know it is pricy, it is worth every cent and scent. I love the servers, all knowledgeable as a well managed spot should be. Food was impeccable from presentation to taste. Atmosphere was mind blowing, especially when you think that this is a building that is over a half of century old. 

Server made recommendations and all were on point. The fried rice here crazy good, not like the crab fried rice I had at the other Japanese spot, gross. She set us up with a bottle and some hand crafted drinks and it did nothing but elevate the experience.  Managers touching tables, chef made apperinces to the tables. This was a well trained room with quality training of server sequence.

As for the food, you will leave happy.   Fish was not to cold allowing the oils to release nicely and giving full flavor to the  sushimi. Fried rice as I said, crazy good. And overall just a great experience.  I love my job but I love to see when the industry produces venues like this, so I can up our game and my standards. 

THANKS KATSUYA"}
{"text":"Great spot with unique and high quality dishes! Service was excellent! Would definitely recommend this spot to anyone wanting to try some unique dishes that you may not find other places! Try the Mushroom Bop!"}
{"text":"Food was great and ASHLEY our waitress was not only beautiful but she was awesome from beginning to end...... First class service!! Told them it was my bday and received all type of comped food and champagne...... Thanks again ASHLEY!"}
{"text":"* Cheese crabmeat croquette * is the bomb !
Lightest crust & stringy-eat moz cheese inside!
What not to love to get 5 pcs for $5.50?

* Curry Pork Loin Katsu * Deep-flavoured curry 
* Carbonara Fish Katsu *
* Original Chicken Katsu * 
* Miso Soup, salad, rice refill! * 
 
Friendliest staff who's v attentive - bonus!"}
{"text":"Was introduced to Katsuya a year ago, and it's quickly become our favourite restaurant in the city. We always try a different appetizer and our go-to we recommend is the Kara-age, it's 1 lbs. of chicken heaven.

Our Tonkatsu go-to is always the Original Japanese pork, and it comes fully loaded with miso soup, rice and cabbage.

We love this place! Great staff and service everything one we come here."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been in town for about a week and this was by far one of our favorite experiences of the trip. Our server Chris was extremely helpful in choosing our dishes and was super personable. The food, overall, was fantastic. We were at Nobu a few days ago and I tell you what, this gives it a run for the money! Just little things about the service and atmosphere really helped to set it apart from the rest. Kudos Katsuya for making our trip grade AA! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Wombo was our server tonite and he was great. When he heard we were locals he treated us to the broccoli dish and it was savory and delicious. Another item that was unique and flavorful was the crunchy rice w/ahi tuna. I will order this again and again."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Wednesday evening. Had to wait a little time for there to be a seat. The staff are very nice and very smiley, felt bad that I'm not much of a smiley guy. Our server was happy to take our order and was very pleasant to speak to. Gotta get used to the yelling when someone comes in and when people also leave. 
Once seated, we were served some hot salty miso soup which definitely whet the appetite. Might have been a little salty for me. While waiting for the food, I found the Korean music a little loud, and I wondered to myself why they'd play Korean music at a restaurant subtitled Japanese Fusion. The crab cheese croquettes came and were very crispy on the outside and mushy on the insides. I think I just liked the cheese. No, wait. I also like the crispy outside and the sauce. So good. The other food came out very soon after and we had the whole table covered with food. I'm gonna go eat now. This is a good place to try once. Or 59 times."}
{"text":"Jennifer (our server) is the real MVP!! Had the BEST dinner- def get the creamy rock shrimp. So delicious!! Great evening with my girlfriends - great food, cocktails and service.  thank you Katsuya!!"}
{"text":"Really good service and good food!!! Our food came fairly fast and was very enjoyable. We had the carbonara katsu and udon, both were delicious. Will come again."}
{"text":"It's good but definitely not worth the money.  Spent well over $250 with a couple of drinks for my wife and I. Service was great but orders took a long time to come out. Also the seating was horrible I got a table that was in a corner with no view what so ever.  Other than the service I don't think I would recommend."}
{"text":"Great first time experience with my SO here! Servers were quick and attentive. Japanese and Korean music play in the background which adds to the Katsu-ya experience. 
Ordered the Cheese Croquette, Curry tender Katsu and Teriyaki Mayo Katsu. Huge portions which adds value to the price (Expect to pay at least $13-15 before taxes for one dish). 
Pork Katsu was fried to crispy perfection and the croquette/korokke came with a sweet sour citrus dressing that matched well. Pickled radish and shredded cabbage came with the rice. All in all I left very satisfied and full by the portions. Definitely don't miss the Zteca here before this!"}
{"text":"I originally gave this place 2 stars mainly because of the long wait and lack of staff. Every thing I had tasted really good. However we waited over an hour and 15 minutes for our sushi. The waiter warned that it would be a little while before we got our sushi. However I seen some tables that sat after us get their sushi before us. After inquiring about it they said they accidentally gave my sushi platter away to someone else. I had a flight to catch and was not expecting to wait this long. Food was excellent. Just ruined by under staffed sushi chefs and poor attention to detail. The manager apologized for the long wait and took the sushi off my bill  he also threw in a free dessert. So I changed my review of 2 stars to 4. Had I not have to wait they would of got a 5. Food is worth going there for. I'm sure it's an amazing place if you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"Went here last night for sushi. Overall I would recommend. Had the Katsuya special roll, light, crisp, great way to start. Then had the double Hamachi and Tiger roll (liquid gold!) - highly recommend all those. The disappointment was the lobster roll - too rich and mushy lobster. I would come here again but would skip the lobster."}
{"text":"We had the classic katsu with cheese. Katsu was crispy and juicy, not dry. The sauce goes really well with it. Overall amazing food and service!! Will definitely come back for their carbonara katsu."}
{"text":"The Best Donkatsu in Toronto!! I am a Donkatsu lover and I've tried donkatsu is many places in Toronto and I can say it without hesitation. Absolutely the best. You have to try this place."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the double cheese carbonara katsu and the garlic chili katsu. The portions were great and so was the service. Will definitely be back.

Note that it's a small restaurant with only about 10 tables. If you have a medium to large sized party, make sure to call ahead to see if they can accommodate you. Also, the parking is scarce if you come on a weekday for lunch."}
{"text":"We were recently in Vegas and my friend wanted sushi so we decided to try Katsuya as it boasted the most vegetarian options (for me) to choose from. We were there around 8pm on a Friday and though we made a reservation we didn't need to as it was not even half way full. We didn't order anything crazy and stuck to some simple basic fare, so for us this was the most well-priced meal we had on our trip to Las Vegas costing just about $50 total for 2 people (before tip and with no booze).  We started with the corn tempura which came stacked high in a beautiful presentation.  Interesting and unique twist on the basic tempura that every Asian style restaurant offers and equally delicious.  We also got the Japanese Caprese Salad which was also very good.  Additionally we ordered a spicy tuna roll, the cucumber roll, and the vegetable roll.  Even though we got a lot of basic menu items they were all fresh, wonderfully presented and executed perfectly. One thing I also enjoyed was the size of the pieces that they sliced the sushi rolls into...they were perfect true 'bite size' pieces. Greatly appreciated since I am always the person either practically choking myself trying to eat sushi in one bite or trying to take it in two and having the whole piece fall apart onto my plate.  With how wonderful even the most basic of menu items were, I can only imagine how good everything else on the menu must be.  Atmosphere is pretty simple, modern with clean lines, and casual.  Bathrooms had a nice decor and were clean.  I liked that the sushi bar was the focal point, located in the center of the restaurant with the regular bar located against the wall to the right.  Service was good-waters were always full and our server was able to answer all of our questions and make suggestions.  Dining at Katsuya was one of two good meals I had for the four nights I was in Las Vegas.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best katsu in Toronto. Great atmosphere, good staff as well.  Usually get the curry. Remember to ask for sauce on the side, else the batter gets soggy by the end."}
{"text":"Had the wagyu steak and asked for medium with no blood and it came out completely well done. Such a waste of a great piece of beef! I couldn't believe a restaurant this nice could mess up that badly. They were accommodating to the situation and gave my boyfriend a free roll, but they really should've just removed the steak all together. Went to Ellis Island and had a better $7 steak than the $50 piece here."}
{"text":"Come here if you want to eat the best katsu in Toronto. Don't listen to some guy below claiming Katsuya's rating is fake news. Big portions and fair prices, you can't go wrong by coming here. Carbonara and teri-mayo options highly recommended. 

Uptown and downtown are both great 5/5"}
{"text":"Katsuya was amazing! The most delicious katsu i had in a while, lots of variety for sauces, type of meat. Crispy on the outside and sooooooo tender in the inside. Very friendly staff, great atmosphere, clean washrooms! You should def try here!"}
{"text":"Katsuya definitely lived up to its hype! This place is located in the North York koreatown, and there are a few parking spots in front of the restaurant. The place is quite small, but there are a few long tables for bigger groups. I got the carbonara cheese katsu and it was SOOO good! The portions here are huge and I could only finish half. The cheese katsu is a pork katsu stuffed with Parmesan cheese and it's as delicious as it sounds! The katsu itself is perfectly crispy, and the cheese is melted when you pull the katsu apart! The sauce had a little bit of spice, but it was not overwhelming. It was very creamy and flavourful! Each plate comes with bottomless rice and cabbage salad. I definitely recommend the carbonara and I can't wait to try their other sauces!"}
{"text":"Katsuya is one of my must go spots in Las Vegas when on my days off. Service is always impeccable both serving and management staff. Will be see you guys next week! Thanks for what you do!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good. Melissa our waitress rocked and hooked us up with some great food. The Aria O roll is the way to go!"}
{"text":"The cooked food is solid and the sushi is fresh and tastes great. Good selection of alcohols that pair nicely with food.  It is on the pricier end for the quantity, but your expextations should have been set accordingly prior to coming here. Staff and service are on the cool/impersonal/take your order and move on style, so 1 star off for having to pay 4+ star prices for 3 star service."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, excellent staff, and fresh sushi. I came here with my girlfriend over Labor Day weekend and had a very pleasant experience. We had baked crab, rock shrimp, and the Brussel sprouts to start. What an excellent balance of flavor on the sprouts! I would highly recommend them. Our main rolls were the Tiger and Corn Crunch. By far my favorite roll would be the Tiger. Such an excellent mixture of flavor profiles. 

The chefs even brought us a free piece of Cod! It was a great touch to our meal.  I would highly recommend Katsuya and will be back again in the future!"}
{"text":"So many different selections of katsu. The fried chicken appetizers were really good. We ordered the pork katsus and it was huge! Very filling and crispy. The meat wasn't too dry or underdone. Would definitely go back again. The place is just a little small and only three parking spaces out front."}
{"text":"Fish katsu is so juicy. Chicken katsu is my favourite. Japanese Katsu is fun to have cauz you have to mix the sesame with the sauce on your own. In general, the Katsu original sauce is very unique that you may want to have a try!"}
{"text":"Got there at 10:20pm and the staff took us in and we had a great dinner. Everything was delicious"}
{"text":"If you a fan of garlic, get the garlic Chilli,  it's good!! And they have good anime taste, if they have subtitle it will be perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Came here when it was still Tonkatsu.  Overall, the food quality is consistent, still delicious. Worth coming to try if you're a big fan of deep fried pork/chicken cutlet.  

Food:
Lots of choice and customization options for the entree. I had the double cheese pork cutlet.  It came with miso soup and salad.  Both good additions to the meal.  I was brave to try the double cheese option.  Although good and moist, it was very heavy and filling.  Great portion size.  Next time, I will stick with just the mozzarella cheese filled one.  

Service:
Service was good and attentive.  They made a mistake on one of the items and gave us free pop to go with our meal even though we said it was okay."}
{"text":"We're originally from LA and I was ecstatic to find out there was a Katsuya out on the strip. Love knowing that I will get exactly what I expect. The fish is fresh, the service is amazing, staff is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing. 

Walked in with a party of 9 and had no problem getting seated. Our waitress was amazing and handled a large party with ease. The Tiger roll was to die for and would definitely be stopping by for some more rolls on my next visit."}
{"text":"We've been here many times! Occasionally, twice a week depending how long my stay is! This place is great to soothe your sushi craving pains! Try everything at least once! You won't be able to say which one is your favorite because everything becomes your favorite dish! Quality of food can't be beat and my taste buds don't lie! I suggest not to rush through eat bite! Your belly will be very happy! Don't forget to try their signature drinks! I love the mojito!

Service was excellent! Wish we could have that same level of service in every place we go out to eat! From the hostess to the manager, everyone in between were very attentive and accommodating to our friend's needs!  Our friend had never eaten Japanese food before and thoroughly enjoyed everything that was suggested minus the raw fish items! He wants to make it a regular stop when we all meet in town again! And yes, it is on our \"favorite place to eat\" list!!!"}
{"text":"We came at somewhat an inconvenient time after going to the movie. 40min before they close. Despite the time pressure, the waiter was nice enough to offer us with miso refill. 

The chicken katsu batter was nicely fried to a thin crispy crust and sauce was delish. Finely sliced cabbage salad is a nice compliment. However, the texture of the chicken was rather mushy and really lack of meat texture.

My husband ordered the pork katsu and was better in terms of meat texture. Nevertheless, we both like their chili sauce a lot. My house special had a nice hint of peanuts, which is not bad. His chili sauce was a definite hit with both of us. We both eat mild, and their chili sauce was able to preserve the spicy note to our smell and taste without the burn."}
{"text":"Went there again and I had to wait about 10-15 min or something which I didnt mind at all. Surprisingly, once we are seated, their server apologized for the wait and gave us two free pops. Although it wasnt even long wait time it was very thoughtful"}
{"text":"I went here back in February on a weekend and the wait in line was short despite it being busy as hell. The waiter kept checking back with people in line. I ordered the Carbonara Chicken Katsu and Crab Meat Croquettes appetizer to share. My boyfriend ordered the Sweet Chili Pork Katsu with cheese. Everything was delicious except the pork would have tasted better without the cheese option. It's loud in the table area but you can hear conversations better if you eat at the counter. The meal was cozy and the service was excellent even sitting at the counter."}
{"text":"I've been to the first location uptown and was super excited to find out they were opening up in downtown. It is right beside Starbucks on Church & Gerrald and you have to go up tiny flight of stairs.

My absolute favorite is Carbonara Cheese Katsu and I usually get it with sauce on the side. Don't expect creamy carbonara sauce though, it's more of a light cream sauce with some seafood bits. It is super delicious and I get it everytime! I get the sauce on the side because I like my tonkatsu crispy and you can just dip it as you eat it.

Would go back in a heartbeat! :)"}
{"text":"4 stars for Katsuya!

Pros - Food is delicious! Hands down! I used to come here almost every other week with friends. I absolutely love their baked crab handroll & their yellowtail sashimi. Those are my absolute two favorites. Their service is great and you don't have to wait long for the food. 

Cons - Everything is wayyy too overpriced and their decor and furnishings aren't that great for an overpriced restaurant. Their tables look cheap and almost feels like they cut down on the decor. Secondly, they're not open everyday. They're closed on Tues-Weds and only open for a few hours a night for dinner. Call and check first to make sure they're even open that day or that hour."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and fast. Environment was warm and welcoming. Tables were clean. An excellent restaurant to dine in."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, the wine bottles were reasonable (we had the Faust cabernet), but the food was just okay.  We had the Octopus Carpaccio which was just fine but nothing spectacular.  For our entrees we had the Black Cod and the Wagyu topped with Foie Gras with a side of overly salty brussel sprouts.  They entrees literally came with nothing, and even though we got a side, I still felt like I needed carbs, especially since there is no bread for the table.  I ended up ordering a side of vegetable fried rice, and it was pretty much the worst I've ever had.  It was so salty that I felt parched and had a horrible taste in my mouth the rest of the night.  Yuck.  I don't think I'd ever come back, but if I found myself here again I would give the sushi a try instead."}
{"text":"This place has become a Vegas tradition for my boyfriend and I. Vibe, quality, and service are all five stars! Social hour is a MUST! 
Favorites: Spicy tuna on crispy rice, Katsuya Fresh, and Jose at the bar!"}
{"text":"TOTALLY Delish.  We tried so many different dishes and they were all great.  A cucumber tuna roll, the lobster tempera, the crispy mushroom rice was so freaking good.  Great customer service clean establishment 

We had such a great time.  Nice music and ambiance"}
{"text":"I found the fish katsu to be a surprising option. The portions are very generous and the carbonara was cheesy with good amounts of bacon and agitators squid bits. 

The miso soup is not bad and they offer free refills (on all except protein; though the protein serving is already big to begin with). 

Would come back again in the future!"}
{"text":"We went to Katsuya for our daughter's 20th birthday. The food was beyond amazing!!! Definitely not your typical sushi place. The menu is extensive with a huge variety to please everyone's taste.  The service was first class! Our waiter was Juan who couldn't  have been more attentive and available. Then, Jessica, the manager came over to introduce herself and to make certain all our needs were met. She was so warm and sincere. Both Jessica and Juan made us feel welcome and so we'll taken care of at all times. My new favorite restaurant in all of Vegas!!!! You will love it!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour selections can scarcely be beat. Worth coming all the way up from south Strip for."}
{"text":"If you want to win your friends over who haven't had katsu before, definitely bring them here. There's a strong lineup of katsu choices and you're bound to pick one you'll love.

I've been here on several occasions for dinner (around 6pm-8pm) and it never fails to satisfy. It's easily become my go-to place for downtown katsu. I've had karaage to start and it was lovely. Their original katsu is great but I'm a huge fan of their carbonara katsu. If you're craving something creamy, definitely go for that. If you're not sure which protein to pick, you can never go wrong with a random selection since they're cooked perfectly every time. The price to portion ratio is more than reasonable, too!

Their customer service is super friendly. Seating is limited so most restaurant goers arrive in groups of 4 or less."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Went for lunch. The music WAY to loud. More like a bar on Friday night"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best experience our server Chris was amazing!! The general manager Leslie came out several times as well to check on our dinner excellent service all the way around. The menu is  impeccable, everything was delicious so many  selections you cannot go wrong with this restaurant  a must try while in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with happy hour here. Full portions with half the price. We had the rock shrimp, crab hand rolls, and tuna tataki. Everything was delicious and fresh! The only thing I could have done without was the piece of fried garlic on top of the tuna. Too much garlic for me but easy just to pick it off the top. 

They had a nice selection of non happy hour sparking/champagne with decent prices. Always a plus for me. My husband had the HH cucumber watermelon mojito ($8). Excellent! Can easily suck down a ton of those if you're not careful!"}
{"text":"Katsuya's Japanese kanji symbol \"katsu\" means victory, and this place definitely won our hearts! Had a date night here inside SLS and definitely enjoyed our entire dining experience! With innovative Japanese dishes, everything not only was presented very well -- but also was full of flavor. The venue was very open and with dim lighting, and the service was amazing from start to finish! :)

We started the night off with some of their signature cocktails, which were delicious! Highly recommend:
- BURNING MANDARIN: Absolut mandarin vodka, hand crushed serrano chili, fresh lemon & orange juice with a splash of cranberry. 
- WATERMELON CUCUMBER MOJITO: Bacardi rum, crushed seedless watermelon, englist cucumbers, fresh mind & freshly squeezed lime juice.

In terms of what we ordered, we shared:
- KATSUYA CEVICHE ($18.00): A generous amount of a refreshing blend of sashimi, dressed with yusu and lime -- with a side of light shrimp chips. Such a perfect appetizer!
- CRISPY BRUSSEL SPROUTS ($13.00): A large helping of brussel sprouts with salsalmic soy reduction & toasted almonds. Amazing! We HAD to get two orders of this... that's how good it was! 
- CRISPY RICE W/ SPICY TUNA: Four individual spicy tuna sushi -- supposedly their most flavorful dish, no soy sauce or anything needed! A definite must try! 
- LOBSTER ROLL ($24.00): Cajun spiced lobster on top of a California roll with dynamite sauce.

We also ordered dessert, but I regretfully cannot tell you what it was called! Please see photos. ;)"}
{"text":"Honestly the best donkatsu in the area! We had deep fried oysters as an app.  Then we ordered the pork tender katsu and hot spicy chicken katsu. Everything was deep fried just right.  Our server was very friendly and polite, checked up on us at the right times. I like everything about this place. The music, the art on the walls, and to top it off, the presentation of the dishes"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very nice dinner at Katsuya! We were a bit full from dinner, so we ordered a little light. Wished we could try so much more! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on katsu- it probably doesn't even crack my top 20, but if it's in front of me, I'll have a piece or two. Katsuya has somewhat changed this for me. I've been wanting to go here after seeing the lineups form around dinner and late-dinner time. It doesn't disappoint. 

Came here after the lunch rush (around 3pm) and we were seated right away. BF and I shared the fried crabmeat balls and one regular chicken katsu. The fried crabmeat balls had just the right amount of sweet/tangy tartar sauce and they were fried perfectly. The chicken katsu is HUGE. If you have a regular person's appetite, you won't be able to finish it. SPLIT SOMETHING! Trust me. Honestly, we could have gone without the appetizer as we still had a few pieces of katsu and rice leftover between the two of us. 

This place gets big points for cheap and cheerful. The katsu here is perfect and it starts with the perfect panko crust. The chicken was also surprisingly tender. I'm definitely coming back here- I'm curious to try the pork curry katsu with cheese. 

Oink oink."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place as well as my family. We are Japanese and we always have family get togethers here. Having Japanese waiters/cooks really makes all the difference and the esthetic is hip and full of energy. I wish it was a larger space but the food is always amazing, fresh and fast, so overall, no complaints. 100% recommend!!"}
{"text":"Originally Mr. Tonkatsu, I'm not sure why the name changes to Katsuya, but the food is just as good! 

Changes to the menu include DOUBLE cheese katsu! DOUBLE! I love cheese so this dish has me going back again and again.

The pork is always perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy/tender on the inside. You still get unlimited cabbage and with the rice, you get pretty full. 

The chicken thigh karage is also a must-order! I actually prefer this to any other fried chicken. 

Overall, service has always been great but remember to bring cash/debit because they don't accept credit cards!"}
{"text":"Good Tonkatsu with many flavours. I've tried Original, Spicy Garlic, Carbonara and Curry. The first 3 are really good except for the Curry. Unlimited soup rice and salad. 

The place is quite small and fits about 30 people, mostly bar stool type seats so it's a quick in and out spot. Very limited parking spots available."}
{"text":"Best curry katsu in the city! Fresh, flavourful, and delicious! The parking is limited here that's the only down fall. Unlimited refills for salad, rice and soup if you order a   Tonkatsu lunch/dinner set. The music is great and so is the service! Lunch is about $15/$16 per person depending what you order. Definitely worth it !"}
{"text":"Delicious. Very fresh fish and outstanding service. I highly recommend this. Off the strip but worth it."}
{"text":"If you crave some Katsu, look no further. This is the place. This is it. I've always ordered online from this place, at least 15 times, and everytime it has been spot-on 5 stars quality. Okay there was that one time with a small error in the system where I got a different dish, but they rectified it fairly afterwards.

-Great portion
-Great taste
-Just the right amount of breading and tender, juicy meat
-Great sauces
-I shouldn't be writing this while hungry

In terms of quality and consistency, Katsuya is probably one of the best restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"This restaurant was okay. There's so much buzz about this chain between Vegas and LA, so I was excited to try it. Our server was amazing and super personable, but the food came in smaller portions and really didn't wow me. We tried about 8 dishes overall, as well as the sake (which was actually pretty good). I don't think I'll return to this location."}
{"text":"For anyone not only looking for great sushi, but some of the most incredible creative food in the world, look no further.  They treat both locals and visitors like royalty with their 5 star servers and bartenders.  I can stay and eat anywhere I come to Vegas and I make a point to always eat at Katsuya.  If you get lucky enough to visit on a night that Jose is tending bar or serving, ask for his section.  You'll be happy you did as he makes you feel like family and friends with his incredible service and suggestions for any meal or drink you may be craving.  He's one of the highest quality bartenders and servers in the business.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"IRASSHAIMASE!!!!! First things you hear when walking to your table, I think our hostess said it first. Then bam all the other employees chime in saying \"IRASSHAIMASE\" aswell!!! Kinda funny, but it got old fast as they do it for all the guest coming in to eat... 

So I got to eat at Katsuya a couple nights ago, I must say the food was amazing! Our server was Ashley and boy was she just the best!!! The hotel itself was nice, I did expect it to be a lot more crowded tho. The restaurant had a really good vibe to it, it was clean, the staff was friendly! 

So we started out with some Rock Shrimp, Brussels, jalapeño Hamachi, Crispy Rice w/spicy Tuna... Everything was good, no complaints... 

I ordered the Miso Cod which was good aswell, didn't care much for the potato thing. Really had a plain taste to it, but the cod itself was good! Nice and hot, miso was perfect on the fish! My friends ordered some sushi rolls believe it was Sahara, Baked Crab, lobster roll. All the rolls where great actually, and I found it neat that they plate the lobster body with the roll!!!! We had sashimi which was nice n fresh, think that was my favorite part of the meal was the sashimi! Dessert was Mochi Ice Cream and this Yuzu tart thing. Not a fan of the Yuzu tart, and the Mochi ice cream was nothing special. 

Now would I return? Of course I would!!! I would recommend trying out This restaurant when you're in Vegas... Yes it's a little pricey but for the experience, atmosphere that this place has you won't be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never had sushi like I had here. I'm usually not a raw fish kind of person but almost everything I had was just that and it blew my mind. Besides the taste bud appeal, the food looks almost too go to eat, the ambiance of the restaurant is amazing and I can't say enough good things about the staff. Matt was our server and he always made sure our waters were filled and answered any questions we had. The manager is gorgeous and brought over our shots that were hot fire flames. I really can't say enough about this place so I'll just show how amazing it is."}
{"text":"Loved this place! After driving by it, at least 100 times since moving to Thornhill, we finally went in! We had the crab and cheese croquettes, chicken karage, my partner had the curry pork loin katsu and I had the spicy white snow chicken katsu...all four dishes, did NOT disappoint! We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"We were a bit worried when we arrived to find Mr. Tonkatsu replaced by Katsuya. Luckily, it was nothing to worry about - it's basically exactly the same, with the addition of a few more items to the menu. **With the exception of the 86'd honey butter chicken, which is now a lovely distant memory ~~

What's new? The most notable difference I saw are the sauce options. You can still get the regular tonkatsu with the tonkatsu dipping sauce & ground sesame (under the Original Japanese Tonkatsu menu), but now you can also get house-made curries and sauces made of seasonal fruits and veggies. 

We tried the house-made sauce, which is normally served right atop the tonkatsu piece. The taste was similar to butter chicken, with the texture of gravy. 
It was tasty, but I recommend asking for the sauce on the side to keep the tonkatsu breading nice and crispy. 

I'm down to try the other sauces too, which I'm sure will be fun to try through the year to taste the differences through the availability/freshness of produce. But today feels like an Original kind of day..."}
{"text":"Ordered the Katsuya Original, I wasn't a huge fan of the original sauce, it was too sweet. The Japanese original was the best and the curry as well. The portions are huge, I wasn't able to finish and the rice is unlimited!"}
{"text":"Katsuya has a good ambience and tasty food."}
{"text":"Great tasting fresh sushi!!! Highly recommended.. best higher end sushi in the city!!! Decent potions for being higher end.. definitely my new sushi spot"}
{"text":"Had the best experience here tonight. From the food to the service provided by Chris, everything was top notch. The A4 Wagyu meat that was in the fried rice, was truly the best I've had in my mouth in so long."}
{"text":"This vibe is really nice. The udon is really good have to try, but a little bit spicy, if you like spicy that's perfect :)"}
{"text":"We dropped by for an early Saturday lunch, since nearby Kaiju has closed and we were craving katsu. The restaurant itself is well lit with plenty of communal seating and an open kitchen which is pretty cool. 

I ordered the hot and spicy chicken, and my friend ordered the regular pork tenderloin. The food arrived quickly and was piping hot. The meats were good, and the tempura coating added a decent amount of crunch. 

General consensus was that the chicken was more flavourful than the pork. I liked the hot and spicy curry, although for some reason it had a very tomato-like flavour. I tried the regular curry and it looked and tasted like turkey gravy. If I'm honest, the curry was the most disappointing part of both our meals. 

Both dishes came with rice and coleslaw. The sesame dressing at the table is absolutely delicious and I found myself adding more a couple of times.

Total cost for two - $38 including tax and tip. This is not cheap, especially given that we didn't have any sides or anything to drink. The portions were very large, however, so you could definitely take some home if you're not super hungry. 

I'll come back to try some of the other curry options, but at $20 a person I won't be coming here every day!"}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight. Although its a small restaurant, they were able to accomodate a group of ten people with little trouble. They told us it would be a 30 minute wait (which we we didnt mind) and it was exactly 30 minutes! They dont take reservations on weekends, so they had us sign up on a waiting list. To the important stuff: food was delish. I actually went to the downtown one first and i thought this location had better customer service (they kept asking us if we needed anything) and i felt like we got slightly bigger portions? I highly recommend the chicken karage thighs. Soooooo tender. My fiance preferred the terri mayo pork lion cutlet. Everyone left here happy and satisfied. Cant wait to come back!

P.s. cash/debit only. Very limited parking. Maybe come on a weekend to use the free street parking nearby."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. I recommend the lobster dynamite and  crunch roll. Best sake is the hananomai."}
{"text":"I've never been to Katsuya before and now, I can't WAIT to go back when I'm in town!  This review is for the Happy Hour menu.  

Stephen Lim was the sushi chef who stuffed me so full, I had a hard time leaving Katsuya and this is as a pregnant woman who gave up raw fish while pregnant.  Thanks to his suggestion, I tried the crispy brussel sprouts.  Omg.  It was SO GOOD!!  It was incredibly tasty and crispy but without being greasy.  I don't know how they managed to do that.  It must be culinary magic.

The hamachi kama was also amazing.  It was fresh and the dipping sauce was both tangy and light.  The chicken karaage was also amazing.  Light, crispy and magical.

I wish I could remember what the name of the roll of was that Stephen made for me.  He understood my craving for sushi but my hesitation to eat raw fish.  While I don't remember the name of the roll, what I DO remember was how delicious it was!  On one hand, I'm glad I got to try it.  On the other hand, I'm sad I ate it because now I want more!!  MOAR!!!

I guess that means I'll have to come back when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had a GREAT time! The food was amazing! Our server Julie had me try things that were a little out of my comfort zone but I ended up LOVING everything. You have to try the corn tempura its addicting!! Will come back!"}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering the Foie Gras & the famous fried rice with wagyu! OH MY --- DELICIOUS!!! The Foie Gras is a rich, buttery, tender, melt in your mouth delicacy. ...A must try for everyone. The rolls was amazing as well..."}
{"text":"the food was very tasty and service was great. Pete was incredible and so funny oh and that facial hair really gets me going.  thank you keep it up"}
{"text":"Not what it's cracked up to be. You're better off going to Nobu and spend a lot of money if you want the trendy out the box sushi. If you want real sushi, go to Torrance
."}
{"text":"Great value and well executed katsu! Had terrimayo and curry katsu where the sauces were on point and generous portions. Lots of different varieties and options of katsu. Had the crab croquette for an appetizer which was so delicious. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area or like katsu!!"}
{"text":"I love this place in Los Angeles, and during my last Vegas trip I got the opportunity to visit the one in Las Vegas, located in the SLS Hotel.  The food is always consistently good at Katsuya, and so is the service.  I always have to get the creamy rock shrimp and soft-shell crap appetizers when I go, but honestly, I've never tried anything I didn't like.  The fish, the sushi, the salads...you can't go wrong.  The vibe is also nice."}
{"text":"Had a really great time here! Ordered the White Snow Chili Katsu and absolutely loved how crispy it was. My girlfriend ordered the terri mayo katsu, which I did not expect to be as appetizing. I generally skip dishes like that but Katsuya is an exception for me! 

Aside the food, the atmosphere and staff was perfect! Friendly, and quick to serve, I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and come back again to try out more dishes."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! At the end of the day, a restaurant has to have great food.. Katsuya is beyond delicious. Highly recommend hitting Happy Hour. But what makes Katsuya SPECIAL is the staff! They truly want you to have a great experience! And make sure to ask for Peter and José, they will make sure you do! 

Great place!"}
{"text":"This happy hour is amazing. The rock shrimp is to die for. I really like the Sahara roll."}
{"text":"Awesome Katsu place! Best in town !  The service is very good. all you can drink miso soup, salad and rice !  Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, awesome food. The tuna tataki roll was the bomb. Jesus the manager was extremely nice, and suggested the Brussels sprouts which were very tasty as well. It's not cheap but worth it! I have been to the one in Miami and didn't like it as much as this one. This Japanese restaurant sets the bar high."}
{"text":"I've just been there for happy hour.
The food and drinks are excellent, the rice crispy spicy tune is like heaven.
The tall black bar tender looks like a God and is so nice and helpful, very professional.
Great restaurant, really."}
{"text":"Really flavourful and cruncy katsu and karage! Not to mention the customer service was great as well. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've been to the LA location and really enjoyed the food there. This one is no different. There was a group of 15 of us and we were seated in the \"dragon room\" as I call it because the wall had a huge drawing of a dragon. There was one other smaller table in the room with us. We ordered tons of food since they were small portions and very easy to share. Can't remember which items stood out the most - they were all very delicious. I think the dry noodles/ramen was my favorite. It was served in a ceramic pot. I liked that you get some of the crispiness from the noodles mixed in with the softer ingredients and the flavors were all there. I didn't have the sushi but someone from our table ordered the sushi boat - it was quite extravagant! The cocktails were very good - we had the special that they made but I can't remember the name of it. Oh we also met Lamar Odom when we dined here. I love the decor of this restaurant and the openness even though it was a small restaurant. Definitely try this place if you cannot get to the one in LA."}
{"text":"I have to say for a Katsu resto, this place hits pretty much all the marks for me. Industrial chic interior, friendly service and most importantly, the food is great. The miso is a bit too salty for my taste but it doesn't take away from the overall experience.  I noticed that most of the staff is Korean (rather than Japanese), but that's just an observation.  Came here with family and everyone (kids, adults and elderly) enjoyed the meal.  Unlimited salad and miso soup is a nice bonus.  Prices are definitely fair for what you are getting.  The only thing that bothered me was that it was a two minute walk away from my work and I didn't know about it lol."}
{"text":"Amazing food and really great service! The location is right by our place so it's super easy to walk over. 

I ordered the classic katsu and it was delicious! They also don't skimp on portions as I could barely finish it there was so much. 

Definitely plan on becoming a regular!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food. The pork tender curry katsu and it was delicious! I am very satisfied with the taste and the service I received here. The server was very friendly and kind. The taste of the pork tender was soft and very filling. The portion was huge! We also did not have the wait long for our food. Definitely a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"DINNER

This place is legit! 

Came in around 6pm on a Friday night and was seated quickly. Restaurant was half full but by the time we left around 630 pm the dinner rush started coming in.

Ordered the curry katsu tender pork and the carbonara katsu tender pork. Food came in quick and both dishes were great but the carbonara stole the show. 

Service was also kind and proficient. And the ambiance had a chill vibe with Korean hip hop/rnb playing in the background.

Will definitely visit this place again!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Japanese restaurants made and seems like a wanna be restaurant. The servers were extremely rude to us and the meat inside the katsu was stiff (I ordered curry katsu). I asked for new chopsticks but it took them ten minutes even after my reminders in order to get them. And also after I got my chopsticks  I found hair in my rice. It was disgusting and it is definitely not a happy atmosphere and wouldn't even dare to go back again."}
{"text":"I tried many tonkatsu places in Toronto, this tasted fabulous. We went as a party of 3, and we all would reorder the 3 different dishes we had. Prices are about $20 tips and tax in.

Little parking so carpool or transit! 

The carbonara tonkatsu was amazing and highly recommended. It does have a littls spice to it, so the cream helps to cool your lips down.  All the tonkatsu were crispy and tendor.  Keep in mind it is refillable soup, salad and rice.  Get more rice to soak up all the delicious sauce you ordered with the tonkatsu.

Limited seating, mostly high chairs.  Not short legs friendly!"}
{"text":"Amazing katsu!!!
I got the original sauce katsu with cheese and honestly - it. Is. Amazing!!!
The katsu is so fresh, not too oily, and the original sauce was sweet and fruity and savoury all at the same time. I am a huge fan! It came with rice and a salad and the portions are generous (had to pack up mine because I couldn't finish it)
Also tried the Chili katsu which was so yummy with the garlic flakes.

For an appetizer we got the crab and cheese croquette, which surpassed all expectations - super delicious and a great way to start the meal.

Can't wait to go back and try some more sauces!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was good!!! The ceviche and cod was to die for ! If you are a Las Vegas local you can get 50% on selected days . Service was ok but it's inside a casino and it seems to be pretty busy . If you come here make sure not to be in a hurry :)"}
{"text":"REALLY GOOD KATSU ! 
Got the pork tender original ($13.50) and the pork loin carbonara ($15.50). The original sauce is kinda tomatoey but sill pretty good. The carbonara is really good! It's pretty light. 

FREE POP WITH CHECK IN

UNLIMITED MISO SOUP AND SALAD
The miso soup is super gooooood. The salad is just cabbage but the dressing IS SO GOOD. Its kinda sesamey. 

BIG PORTIONS WORTH THE PRICE :) 

Servers are also super nice!"}
{"text":"What a find!! My wife had the Wagu beef, I had a lobster dish. Price, service and food was excellent. 5 stars if we didn't have to listen to the sounds of the casino. We will be back."}
{"text":"I was finally able to come to the social hour my friends have been telling me about it for a while, finally made some time to come in!! Crispy rice spicy tuna and tuna tataki roll my favorite!! Overall great service def coming back!"}
{"text":"Been driving past this place so many times and always wanted to give it a try. Finally decided to stop by on this holiday Monday with my lady! What a gem! This place is great! Clean, friendly, speedy service with fantastic food. The deep fried goodness is light and non greasy. Portions are large and all in all fantastic flavour. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place. Enjoy going during their happy hour and getting the corn crunch roll."}
{"text":"Don't miss it if you like tonkatsu! It's unusual to have such a big plate of meal! And it taste really good!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out before heading to the Foundry. The sushi was delicious and our bartender Peter was awesome! Our mojitos were so yummy! Definitely coming back! Totally recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Love this place! One of the hidden gems in Vegas.    No matter where we stay we come back to the SLS for katsuya! We have been to nobu and koi and love sushi and this place is top notch. The service is impeccable and most importantly the fish is very fresh!!  We love Christopher who is very attentive and gives great service and the sushi chefs are awesome. Highly recommend: The Brussels sprouts ( we ordered two bowls!), Sahara, tuna tataki, spicy albacore sashimi with crispy onion. The watermelon cucumber mojito is yummy. Try to make the happy hour 5-7 for great deals but come for the sushi anytime!!"}
{"text":"Went here for an evening dinner and it was a great experience. Food was tasty, atmosphere was great, and service was above and beyond excellent. Our server, Matt, really took the time to make sure that our dining experience was great. He explained the menu thoroughly, made sure our drinks were always filled, and most of all made the entire table laugh many times. The sushi was some of the best we've had in the valley and I would definitely recommend this place to any of my friends. Thank you Matt and Katsuya!"}
{"text":"I came to check this place out because of the 50% local discount (very smart!) 

Food came out fast and was delicious. I really liked the yellowtail and rock shrimp appetizer. I also had the lobster roll and I didn't love the sauce on it but other than that it was very good. 

The place was really busy and looks very similar to Andreas at Encore.

I live right by this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had a memorable dinner and night celebrating our Anniversary and our friends 40th. The food was as amazing as the reviews and their reputation. The Katsuya known dish is the spicy fired tuna - we loved it! So much that we ordered 3 of them! :0 
We ordered several rolls and all of them were yummy one after the other. The Katsuya roll was one of my favorites (I got it without the scallops). What really made this a perfect 5 star review was the above and beyond exceptional service by Chris. Good satisfies the tummy, good service makes the entire experience making the food even tastier! Thank you Chris and Katsuya for a wonderful Vegas dinner experience. We will be back again!!! Xo"}
{"text":"Cheesey fried chicken goodness with perks -- unlimited refills on the miso soup (which btw is super tasty, really warms your soul haha), rice and the salad. Katsuya is a great new addition to downtown Toronto eats. 

I've been to the Katsuya on Yonge and Steeles and I would say the vibe is the consistent. The signature wooden Japanese decor with simple light bulbs always makes for a casual bar vibe. A little taken aback that they didn't serve liquor at this location, but I guess they're still awaiting a permit.

The food was consistent with the North York location as well --- crispy chicken with wonderful variations that all deliver. I ordered the White Snow Chili and the Cheese Chicken Katsu option. I went for a cheesey inside and cheesey outside (which is the standard of how white snow chili is made); great dish for cheese lovers. The sauce was sweet and savoury with a seemingly tomato base. The portions were very large but everything was so delicious you wouldn't want to stop eating! 

If it's your first time here, the front pages of the menu describes what each option including protein choices on each different seasoning of katsu.

It's a bit on the pricey side as it's around $15-17 dollars in average for a katsu dish. I'm not too sure about the udon or other dishes/appetizers, but I would come back to experience the other katsus. I've tried the okonomiyaki, carbonara, and original and they were all great so I'm sure the rest of the menu would not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Like fixing bikes, home appliances, need bikes, friendship add me.

If you check in on Yelp here, you get a free soft drink of your choice from Katsura restaurant."}
{"text":"Without a doubt some of the best sushi in vegas..the hotel is also very cool. The service was oustanding and they pointed us to some of the best their menu had to offer...definitely will return when back in vegas"}
{"text":"Krazy for Katsu at Katsuya! 

I came here last night with my sister after reading all these wonderful reviews and looking at the mouthwatering pictures. It was about 5 pm and we were able to be seated right away, but it was busy as there is limited seating. 

To start we got Cheese Crabmeat  Croquettes and Takoyaki. Both were delicious! They give you a bowl of miso soup after you order which I thought had a great miso flavour, better than many restaurants. I got the Hot Spicy Cheese Katsu and my sister got the Cheese Katsu burger. I loved the hot spicy sauce, it had a good spice level and a nice chili flavour. My sister really enjoyed her burger and would get it again. It was messy to eat though, so a fork and knife seems required which they provided when they brought her plate. She got the combo which comes with fries and a pop so I had a couple fries to try and they were nicely coated and crispy. 

Everything was beautifully presented, tasted great, and service was friendly and quick. There are lots of different sauces to choose from and you can get pork, chicken, or fish. The portion size is also good for what you are paying.  Location is a plus for me as it's close to my work. Will definitely be returning and telling everyone to try this place!"}
{"text":"KATSUYA BY STARCK
SLS Las Vegas
2535 S Las Vegas Blvd
Las Vegas, NV 89109
5 STAR

The night started out badly due to a flood warning and heavy rains in our area.  The parking garage at the SLS is an extremely old structure.  Thankfully, we parked on the first floor because the elevators were shorted out due to the rain.  I am disabled, so struggling down one flight of stairs along the outside of a very wet, roof pouring water on top of me, uncovered stairwell, was a bad start and a bad reflection on the SLS Hotel only (not the restaurant).  I also had to walk through large puddles of water in some very expensive leather shoes.  This put me in a very bad mood before even starting dinner.  But enough of that.  

Our reservation was for 8:30pm.  We arrived at 8:22pm at the Hostess Station but no one was manning it.  However, a hostess showed up within minutes. and we were seated at our choice of table or bar.  If I'm seated within ten minutes of my reservation, I consider it five stars.  We were seated a few minutes prior to our reservation.  So, kudos again.  Our waitress' name is Ashley.  She, along with two helping servers/bus persons, did an excellent job.

Although I have rated everything for the evening, I do have to point out that the reservation was well known by the staff and we were being presented the best service, table seating, timely food service, just the best of everything under the direct supervision of the general manager.  We expected no less.  So this review should be judged by readers completely on the taste and presentation of the food alone.

We chose our food selections according to reviews we read, selecting only the items people had raved about and that we had not ordered on our first time in the restaurant.  We order two drinks, a Burning Mandarin and a watermelon/cucumber cooler (not sure the price but Happy Hour showed them for $7 each), and two waters with lemon.  At the same time we also ordered our appetizers, Crispy Brussels Sprouts ($13) and Wagyu Shashimi ($18).  The drinks came out instantly and were quickly followed by the appetizers.  The watermelon/cucumber cooler was delicious.  The waitress remembered the lemon slices for the water.  I didn't like the Burning Mandarin, it seemed too strong to me, but my son loved it.  The Crispy Brussels Sprouts were not anything like I imagined.  They looked more like wilted mini leaves in a bowl.  Looks were deceiving.  They were sooo delicious and different (in a good way).  I cannot wait for someone to leak the recipe so I can make them at home.  The Wagyu Shashimi was outstanding too.  It was medium rare tender beef strips with a light flavored oil on top.  Also delicious.  I added wasabi to my bites and it just elevated the flavor.

For our main course, we ordered a Wagyu Rib Eye ($48) medium rare, A4 Wagyu Fried Rice, Pork Belly and a Tiger Roll with fresh wasabi.  The Pork Belly and Tiger Roll arrived first, shortly followed by the Rib Eye and Fried Rice.  The Pork Belly should get 10 stars.  I died and went to heaven with my first bite.  My son does not eat or like fatty meats, and yet, he fell in love with it on the first bite, too.  I will be ordering a side of Pork Belly every time I eat there from now on.  It was the star of my meal.  The Tiger Roll was large with about 12 pieces, and scrumptious, a definite 5 stars.  The Wagyu Rib Eye arrives on a sizzling plate topped with truffle butter and a side of wasabi-ponzu sauce which you can use for dip or to pour over the beef.  The beef is sliced atop two large caramelized onion slices.  Perfect for sharing, which is what we did.  The Wagyu Rib Eye was good, very tender, but not extraordinary, but definitely 4 stars.  My son felt like the Wagyu Fried Rice was the star of his meal.  The rice is sticky style so it's easy to pick up with chop sticks.  It has a luscious sauce and was topped with five larger than bite-size portions of Wagyu beef, very tender, and sooo flavorful.

Lastly, I have to mention the General Manager Jonathan Toobi.  He was awesome (and gorgeous (but that's a different review *grin*).  He made us feel so welcome that it was almost like eating with family.

Overall, I have to give the experience and food 5 full stars.  I am also attempting to remove my original one star review, because I no longer feel it does the restaurant justice.  If you have had a bad experience at Katsuya, it may be in your best interest to give it a second chance, and mention to the hostess that your first experience was not good and you are hoping for better service.  I'm sure they will make note of your request and go out of their way to show you your experience may not be the norm for the restaurant.  Also, maybe stick to the food items that have received gushing remarks of goodness.  They have a new summer menu featuring an appetizer, entre and dessert for $39 a person.  We'll be trying that soon and will let you know if the great experience continues to stand."}
{"text":"A little bit pricy, but the taste is good. We ordered Carbonara Katsu and Curry Katsuya, both tasted great."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, supreme service, and excellent food. Came here for lunch and luckily it's not busy. Their bread crumbs are made in-house and made daily. I got the original sauce chicken Katsu and sweet chilli pork tender Katsu. Love them both as both Katsu are crispy and fluffy and not oily. Meats are tender and juicy. Overall food is very good. Will try other flavors.
For the service, girl greeted us with good smile and very attentive. She even ask if we want more miso soup which other place will never asked you that.
Overall, I'll highly recommend to come try this place if you are around the area. The price is reasonable and very good portion, and again food is good. Definitely will come back and hope service and food will still good"}
{"text":"Katsuya is a nice addition to the Japanese food scene on the strip. It should be categorized as a Nobu-like upscale Japanese with a modern American twist.

Items selected:

- Lobster & Truffle Chawan-mushi
- Baked crab hand rolls
- Creamy rock shrimp
- Wafu carbonara
- Wagyu tobanyaki
- Negima
- Sunset roll

Everything was tasty. The lobster-Truffle Chawan-mushi was an invention that has a potential to be reimported to Japan... It could go straight into a traditional Kaiseki."}
{"text":"Great food nice server. Wish they did a smaller portion though because it's way too big!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time with the Katsuya crew and I am ridiculously pleased. The food was amazing and the service was impeccable. Alice, my bartender, is super personable and attentive while maintaining an impressive level of efficiency. I had Brussels sprouts, a spicy tuna roll, a cucumber sunomono salad and a watermelon cucumber mojito. The mojito alone would make want to come back, but the entire experience was lovely. Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"It was amazing!!! Highly recommend especially the hot spicy katsu! Will come back again! Good for quick dinner or lunch with friends!"}
{"text":"I've been to the North York location, and this place is just as good! My favourite is the crab-cheese appetizer. The katsu here is really good and always fried perfectly. I always get the sauce on the side so that the katsu doesn't get soggy. 
It comes with unlimited refills of rice, cabbage and soup.
They don't take reservations and seating is limited so I suggest calling ahead before going over to see how busy they are. There is also no time limit for sitting there so I had a great time catching up with friends here."}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to its rating. As someone who just recently went to Japan and had tonkatsu there, I was thoroughly impressed with the quality at Katsuya! 

We ordered the cheese crabmeat croquette (which is delicious and worth every penny), the original pork loin and the carbonara double-cheese. 
Everything was cooked perfectly and crispy. Portions are good and you can get refills on soup, salad and rice! You will definitely not leave hungry!
The only regret I have is not asking for the sauce on the side. Because they pour sauce on half the tonkatsu, it ends up being pretty soggy."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

I recommend Japanese katsu, my friend ordered chilli souce one tho, it tastes not good. Chicken wing also didn't taste much."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?? From the exceptional customer service provided by our super star server Natasha to the amazing food! This place has made me a customer for life! Natasha recommended a great cold sake which I have to admit, initially I was a bit reluctant to try as I usually order hot sake, but she said this one was great and she was correct! The chicken fried rice was absolutely delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ras, tres bien, le restaurant authentique japonais, on est transporté !
A real Japanese atmosphere, the decor is amazing; wooden combined with rock elements like the table, I love that ! The meal was good, enough warm, and the prices are fair, I don't hesitate for a good tip, it was a very good experience !!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times in the past, but the overall service quality has taken a massive hit. Today we were passed off 4 times, took 15 minutes each time for a server to stop by. Never had anyone offer refills. Took three people and 5+ minutes for utensils. It took the server over 15 minutes to bring back the check when we were trying to pay. I could continue, but you get the point.

I am also not certain, but the menu has changed for the worse. Yes it is mainly sushi, but the meat entree options are virtually non existent. The LA location has a *much* better menu. As a whole, I used to recommend this place, but now I would suggest avoiding altogether. Would also encourage avoiding SLS outright."}
{"text":"Came here with a buddy. The service was fantastic, especially aiding in picking out Saki for two Saki novices. We ordered the Ceviche as an App that was pretty good, but not 5 star worthy. We ordered a total of 4 rolls.. 2 of which were AMAZING.. the other two were just ok. The Saki that was recommended was FANTASTIC.

  The sum of the review above equals a 4 star review."}
{"text":"Definitely did not disappoint! My friends and I came to eat here during our trip to Las Vegas and the rolls & small plates were all fantastic!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting. This time I made sure to sample two of their katsus with sauces so I wouldn't be eating just fried cutlet - don't want to be parched with a side of their salty miso soup 

Their curry tastes identical to Glico curry if you make it well - not sure if this is kudos to Glico or if it's dissing Katsuya...

Homemade sauce is most likely tomato based/canned soup, like the sauce you would get on a Hong Kong style pork chop rice. 

Katsu itself is great!!! - thick piece of CRISPY tender pork which 100% will have you taking home a good 33% of the cutlet. Would definitely come back if I was craving cutlets (the cutlets I usually opt for are thin and beat with a hammer at a 24 hour Korean resto lel.)"}
{"text":"Salmon and Caviar was delicious as was the Mushroom Bop - look out for local special/using players card otherwise it's pricey for the quantity, quality and location."}
{"text":"They make the bread crumbs by themselves using a big loaf of bread, I guess for this reason, the cutlet batter very light and crispy. Tonight we've ordered the cheese crabmeat croquette, curry katsu (pork loin) & original katsu (pork tender) they were so good, most of the scores from their sauce. 

This restaurant like a hidden gem in Mississauga, it's really good to have such unique restaurant and the fact is I don't need to go downtown anymore.

In conclusion, good food & friendly staffs."}
{"text":"Good food and excellent atmosphere! Large portion for the price. Would definitely recommend and will come back. We ordered the Katsuya original chicken and garlic spicy pork with cheese filling and both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Large portions. Got the pork tenderloin katsu curry. It was massive, freshly fried, nice and crispy and not oily/heavy. Curry was tasty.I was looking forward to enjoying the sliced onion as pictured in the menu..but alas, it just looked like it with solo curry with small/nonexistent onion inside. Would've also liked a bit more rice as well. Comes with a humongous mountain of veggies.

Unlimited miso soup which was nice. Free pop with check-in on social media."}
{"text":"Katsuya has made a name for himself in sushi, but I've been disappointed by the Strip versions of other chefs' restaurants before. I'm happy to say I was delighted by most of the dishes here!

CRISPY RICE WITH SPICY TUNA: it's crispy, it's spicy, it's delicious! But with a menu descriptor calling it \"our most flavorful dish\" and \"the one Katsuya is most famous for\", I had higher hopes. This version did not stand out from others I've had elsewhere but it is good.
LOBSTER & TRUFFLE \"CHAWAN-MUSHI\": I'll never know how great this dish is unless I come back. I ordered it, but it never arrived. More on this later, as service is why my rating is not higher.
CRISPY BRUSSELS SPROUTS: with balsamic soy reduction, green onion, and toasted almonds. What the heck?! These sprouts are flipping delicious. Didn't see this coming, but the sauce perfectly complements the roasted veggie, and the onion and almonds add texture. Going to try to replicate this dish at home!
SALMON SASHIMI WITH CAVIAR: fresh, flavorful salmon wrapped with onion chutney, topped with caviar, and placed on a slice of cucumber. The artful presentation was as good as the flavor. Be sure to use the accompanying lemon wedge, as the burst of acidity elevates the flavors.
TIGER ROLL: Only Katsuya can put shrimp tempura, truffle oil, and caviar in my sushi- AND make me like it! I don't even understand how everything works together but it just does. A stand-out roll for sure. 

Starck has made a modern space with traditional, custom accents to perfectly showcase the upscale take on sushi presented here. The service is friendly, but unfortunately I had significant difficulties receiving a dish I ordered. 

TLDR:
The chawanmushi was ordered as an appetizer. Halfway through my entrée, I asked my server to check on it and he admitted he forgot to put it in.  He added it in and assured me it would be here soon. After a considerable wait, it was removed from my bill for the inconvenience, and I was assured it would be out any minute. Bartender was extremely embarrassed and apologized profusely, and I ultimately left over an hour after placing my order- and never received the dish.  Mine is not the first to mention significant delays and miscommunications between the servers and kitchen staff."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas this past weekend, and I really wanted to try this sushi place. I heard they had great sushi, but I was not Impressed at all. The sushi reminded me of fast food Sushi!  over priced and over rated. I will not be back here."}
{"text":"Katsuya offers large portions for low prices and high quality flavour. During my visit, I got the crab meat croquette, deep frier oysters, and the snow white chilli katsu.

The crab meat croquette was absoulutely delicious. It is definitely a must try!

The deep fried oysters could have been larger and although I am not a fan of the wasabi mayo, I can see why it was an appropriate sauce topper.

Finally, the snow white chilli katsu. It was sweet (judt the way I like it), but for some without a sweettooth (like my boyfriend) I can see why this would not be the best choice.

Overall, the restaurant offers delicious food and I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place when it was mister tonkatsu but two noticeable changes really disappointed me. 1. I found the meat to be much thinner and less flavorful when trying a classic cheese tonkatsu set. It used to have a meat and cheese taste but now it is literally just cheese and breadcrumbs to me. 2. The salad dressing has completely changed to this watered down vinaigrette I told them they didn't give me enough dressing thinking it was a mistake, but when they gave me a dish of watery dressing my frown got bigger. The dressing completely sinks to the bottom of the dish, leaving the top with no flavour at all. The salad dressing was my favorite thing about mr tonkatsu and I am very disappointed about this. I also found the miso soup to be a bit more watery but overall flavour was fine. I will probably not be returning until they thicken their salad dressing, completely serious. I would rather go to the downtown one if they still had the original owner and chefs."}
{"text":"I have had sushi at three different spots this week and Katsuya was my least favorite. The service was good, but the meal was average. I was told it would be the best sushi ever and I simply wasn't blown away. Their famous crispy rice/tuna dish was overcooked and the rolls were okay; however, their snow crab hand roll was delicious and memorable."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great!  Real quality food, not your typical bar food happy hour crap you normally put up with. Start with the Brussels sprouts, move on the the Crispy rice with spicy tuna, then finish with the double hamachi rolls. Heaven. Bonus if Jose is behind the bar girls!"}
{"text":"I had way too much to drink the day befor so our original dinner plan got cancelled.
I wanted something like porridge or soup so I found this place!
Thinking rice will be better in my stomach than greasy buttery steak.

I had not expectation since I never been or looked at this place before.

We got chicken karaage, lobster roll, sushi rice, wagyu, and salmon roll.

I was looking for some miso soup or something but since I didn't see any I got the lobster roll.
FYI, I don't eay raw fish.

The chicken karaage came out a little late dispite the fact that it's an appetizer.
But luckily the salmon roll came out right away and soon after the lobster roll came.
I did not try the salmon roll but my bf said it was good.
I tried the lobster roll and it was delicious!
I was a bit skeptical since CA calls crawfish as lobster too. But they do use lobster! Just the onems without claws.

The chicken karaage was great!!! By far the best!!
Even though I was sick, I couldn't stop eating it!

But sadly, the wagyu that I was expecting to be great was not so good...
It was too cold... i don't know why but it seemed like it waited out in the open too long before it made it to our table.
The butter on top wasn't even melted and still hard and cold..
I was going to ask them to redo it but I wasn't feeling good to wait for another one to get cooked.
Won't get the wagyu again.


But next time I stay at SLS hotel, I will definately come again to try others as well!"}
{"text":"Udon Tempura * Pork Tender Katsu * The udon was good, but the pork katsu was AMAZING - best I've had in the city. The serving size was good, the pork was juicy, and the batter had the perfect texture - light yet crispy. I tried the Original sauce, which was freshly made, but a bit sweet for me - looking forward to trying the curry sauce or hot sauce versions. Only downside was that, although it made for a great visual, the part of the katsu that was covered in sauce became soggy too quickly. The restaurant decor was a nicely done industrial with stone, wood and exposed brick. Unfortunately no booze,  but currently applying for a liquor license. Will return!"}
{"text":"We schleped up here from Planet Hollywood and it was worth it. Come during the Social Hour (5-7 Tues-Sat) to try stuff at reduced prices."}
{"text":"I was visiting my three brothers in Las Vegas over the weekend and decided to come check out Katsuya by Starck. As soon as we approached the main entrance I knew this would be an experience like no other. We were greeted by a beautiful hostess, the decor and set up of the dining room was sleek, and the ambiance was electric. We had many items from tempura corn, and crispy rice to negiri, and sushi. It was incredible! The quality of the ingredients and execution of all the dishes more then exceeded our expectations. I will definitely be coming back and would absolutely recommend it for anyone."}
{"text":"Very delicious and extravagant experience cooking my own BBQ in front of us in a restaurant serving authentic Asian food! 11/10 would come again and order everything no matter what the price is!"}
{"text":"Cash or debit only.

Can get quite busy so prepare to wait during peak times. Servers are friendly although there's a bit of a language barrier. You get a very big portion of katsu and is worth what you pay! The tenderloin is very tender and the sauce is very good. Most dishes come with a salad and a small portion of rice. Simple menu with good options. There is no vegan option. Can't go wrong here and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't see the attraction. Fried chicken. Yep, soooooo... line ups, check. Tasty veg? No."}
{"text":"The pork cutlet was really crispy and the garlic chilli sauce really complemented it well. I love how they give unlimited rice, salad and miso soup! Will come again."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Katsura for sometime. It is my daughter's favorite sushi restaurant in Los Angeles, and she has excellent taste. Plus the Yelp reviews for the restaurant here in Vegas were pretty good. So when I saw that they were offering half-price for locals, the deal was too good to pass up.
The restaurant itself is right off the casino in the SLS. And the entrance is completely open to the casino. So there is a significant noise level while you are eating.
The busboy was to our table almost immediately to fill our water glasses. Our server also came by fairly quickly. Because we were first timers, he explained many of the menu items for us. Overall I would rate the service is very good to excellent.
We wanted to try things that would not be readily available at our local sushi restaurant. Based on several of the yelp reviews plus the recommendations of our server, we decided to start with three appetizers. We chose the lobster truffle chawanmushi, Japanese octopus carpaccio, and the crispy rice with spicy tuna. The chawanmushi is a very small cup of what I would describe as a cross between a flan and miso soup. It was interesting, but not great. The crispy rice with spicy tuna was also interesting but nothing special. And the octopus was a real disappointment. For our main courses, we decided to try the double hamachi roll and the mushroom bop. I would say the double hamachi roll was ordinary. Not bad but certainly not outstanding. The one truly outstanding dish that we had was the mushroom bop. This is primarily a rice and mushroom dish that is served in a smoking hot bowl. The rice continues to cook as it sits in the bowl. So when you start the dish the rice is soft. By the time you finish the dish the rice that is touching the bowl is quite crispy. Variety and flavor of the mushrooms in the dish were spectacular. Getting to try this dish made the drive to the Strip worthwhile.
I really wanted to like this restaurant more. To their credit, the service and the presentation of the food were quite good. But you need much more than that to justify the very high prices. The food did not distinguish itself from my local sushi restaurant, which is quite good, to justify the price and the inconvenience of schlepping to the Strip for a sushi dinner. I don't anticipate returning."}
{"text":"Chicken carbonera katsu was soft and juicy. Sauce was very creamy and more than expected. Would come back here for another round of katsu."}
{"text":"My partner and I have eaten at the North York location and that was fine. We tried this location where I ordered the spicy udon carbonara and he ordered the curry cutlet and takoyaki. We thought the food was good, then udon very creamy and quite spicy. Unfortunately, we both had upset stomaches the next day."}
{"text":"So happy that another katsu place has opened up downtown! Katsuya offers different types of katsu sets, with proteins like pork and chicken served with various sauces to choose from (original sauce, carbonara, chili garlic, spicy garlic, curry, etc.). All of the sets come with unlimited refills of miso soup, cabbage salad, and rice.

We came on a Thursday night and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. I reckon they will get more and more popular in the coming days though.  Interior is very cute - rustic with cozy lighting. Service is attentive and friendly. My fiance ordered the carbonara chicken katsu ($17.50) and I ordered the original chicken katsu ($13.50). The chicken was soft and juicy inside the crispy batter. We both got our sauces on the side, which I would recommend as the sauces can get heavy! The carbonara is creamy and comes with tiny pieces of shrimp. The sauce that comes with the original chicken katsu is reminiscent of ketchup and you add self-grinded sesame seeds to it.

{"text":"A new absolute favourite.

For me this place is one of those random discoveries that only happen every once in a while - it was a lucky day! I had been having a Katsu craving for weeks and this place met all my craving needs and then some.

There is a wide variety of plates and katsu varieties to choose from - I decided to try the Terri Mayo Katsu and oooh boy. Perfect Teriyaki sauce, meat was tender and perfectly cooked, the mayo added a spot-on creamy texture and the bonito flakes on top gave a really interesting crunchy touch to the plate. 

I am still surprised that I came here with a friend during lunch hour and the place was not busy at all - we were immediately seated and service was excellent and quick.

Curious to try the curry Katsu next time :)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, tasty food, free refill on rice, miso soup, and cabbage. Solid semi-fancy lunch location."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Katsuya in LA and that one was much better. I ate at this one in Vegas on a Thursday night. wakled up without a reservation at about 8:45 and got seated right away. Unfortunately my experience was one were the food was better than the service. We started off with our drink orders, everything went well with that. When the drinks arrived we placeded orders for appetizers, some gyoza and a few bowls of miso soup. So then just one bowl of miso soup shows up, we said we needed two more I gave her the benefit of the doubt maybe she mis heard us. By then we went ahead and ordered our entrees. Not sure if they thought we were sharing or going tapas style or family style wbecause they started bringing out plates of our entrees but not all together...keep in mind we have still not recieved the gyoza we ordered for appetizers. Things just kept coming but not all together, it was a mess. Finally the gyoza came out after we were finished with our entrees. 

All in al the flavor and quality of the food was good but the service was not so good. I would probably not recommend Katsuya to anyone unless they were staying at SLS(which I would not recommend either) since it is so far off the beaten path."}
{"text":"Love the food here, especially the double cheese original Katsu, gonna come tomorrow!"}
{"text":"A4 wagyu fried rice is amazing. Must try. So worth it. Try the tuna on crispy rice, lobster and truffle starter, and crab roll. Awesome meal.

The wagyu fried rice may be the best thing I've ever had, well at least in the Asian category.

Service was excellent."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I are regulars at the SLS, and we LOVE katsuya everytime we go we get the yellow tail starter and it is amazing and so fresh. We used to go to yellow tail in Bellagio but we have switched to here since it is so good. 5 stars for this sushi! We will be back next week!"}
{"text":"Lighting is key when dining.  K is WAY too bright especially for Vegas.  Even the darker areas, like the sushi bar were a strange, unflattering tone.  

I expected there to be blips through the evening but overall the service and the food were good.  Great timing between dishes.  

Missteps in the eats: 
-crab salad, greens lightly dressed but the crab was watery and super salty, reminded me of the meat from the legs of a buffet
-salmon caviar, bitter and what's the mystery creamy stuff inside?

Definitely do: wagyu foie, chutoro and double hamachi roll.  

Ok black miso cod, generous portioning, would not order again.  Not as buttery as other renditions.  

Carry watari bune, ferry boat daiginjo.

The sushi fish quality is quite good.  Rice is a bit al dente for my taste."}
{"text":"It Is My First Time Here At Katsuya Restaurant There Food Is Great,There Service Is Great,There Scenery Is Great I Loved It And It Is So Crowded That I Wouldn't Know Where To Sit,But I Know Where To Sit Because I Know There Food Is Famous And Innovative Thats Is What Will Convince Me To Come Back Here For More Food. ! ? Great Job. ! ? I Will Come Back Here Again. ! ?"}
{"text":"I was staying at the SLS and decided to have dinner here on a Friday night.

Its much smaller than the LA location, but the food is actually better.  You MUST get the brussel sprouts and the crispy rice with spicy tuna.  It was literally the best spicy tuna I ever had.

Also, they french press their coffee.  It was great coffee!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch! The sauces are mouth watering especially the curry!!!! I love the pork Katsu I had left me satisfied and super satisfied. They offer refreshing water with lemon for your table and will soon be offering Sapporo! Service was fast and on point. Friendly server with a smile complimented by a chill atmosphere. Definitely will be returning. Work it 100."}
{"text":"An impressive sushi house.  My server was outstanding..Jose..attentive, good recommendations, and always available. Had the dynamite lobster..was expecting a bit more spice, but the sauce and mushrooms more than made up for it.  Would order again for sure.
Good food, great service...what else do you want?
An impressive place in a hotel way out on the strip"}
{"text":"Great miso soup. Amazing lemon water that came right away. Great service with friendly people. The katsu was really good. We particularly enjoyed the carbonara one. Definitely worth a visit and we'd come back :)"}
{"text":"May have been the best sushi I've ever experienced. Excellent quality and taste. Presentation was so effective that other tables inquired about my selection. I stopped at the bar for a pre-dinner drink and was met with very capable and pleasant bartenders. Selection of cocktails was enticing and the drinks themselves were wonderful.  This restaurants alone is reason enough to visit SLS."}
{"text":"We had a dining comp from the hotel, and decided to go here.  We asked about the Social Hour, and were told initially that we would have to go into the bar for that, and then could move to the main dining room after for the rest of our meal. 

  Rhassan sat us down and told us that he would take  care of us the whole time in the bar.   He did!!  We started with cocktails, I had the Kiwi Envy, and it was wonderful. 
 We ordered the Lobster Tempura, Crispy Brussel Sprouts, Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna, Wagyu Sliders, Baked Crab Hand Roll and Edamame.  Everything was very delicious. 
 The Lobster Tempura was one of the best entrees I have had.   The Crispy Brussel Sprouts were absolutely delicious and addicting.  

We finished our meal with two glasses of White Wine and could not get dessert because we were so full!!   We will definitely go here again, and Rhassan is Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The food here was awesome! The service was lacking, they brought out our food at very random times, so the party did not get to eat together. But the food made up for it. Everything was REALLY good. Especially the Mushroom Ramen. The best I've ever had. Lots of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional. The service, not so much. I'm hoping I popped in on a busy night and the server couldn't help it. The yellow tail sashimi is my favorite thing on the planet. I also had the spicy tuna on crispy rice...which could have been a little more crispy rice. The food was delightful."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here so bad and since it was my birthday and locals night it was a perfect reason to, and why not?

We expected it to be a cool and busy place because we knew how hip and trendy it was but never the less there was a variant in the crowd which was nice not a \"night club\" turn Resturant with a bunch of annoying  drunk 20 something's and a bad DJ with loud music. 

The Resturant was immediately packed right when the ropes went down but service was never behind. Our waitress Ashley was very nice, super attentive and extremely accommodating. She must have went back to ask the chef if they can revise their tasting menu to suit my needs about 5 times. But every time she did they pleasantly did what I asked and I was very happy. 

My wife and I ordered the tasting menu for me with a Lobster Roll, Tiger Roll, fried chicken Karanga, Tempura veggie (not your typical) love the exotic veggie verity and dessert Sampler. There was only 3 minor mishaps 1. The Fried chicken app didn't come out till almost last and after we asked about it 4 times 2. Lobster roll came out without the lobster tail and head shells like the one served to the people next to us and 3. My wife asked for candles to be put on the dessert (being that it was my bday) and the dessert came out without it. But it did come out from a different server. So our original waitress took care of it right away apologized and was very sincere about it.

But all that didn't matter because everything was so good (except for the Green Tea Cheese cake) I didn't really like it at all. Our waitress and servers were great the whole staff was so friendly and nice and the food and Burning aka \"Spicy\" Mandarine drink was amazing. This is and awesome resturant with great food great staff and great atmosphere. I had an amazing experience and will return again and again. Thank you Katsuya and my wife for a great Birthday.

P.S. I appreciate food that not only taste good but look good as well, presentation was beautiful and on point!!!"}
{"text":"Very small portions but excellent sushi and sashimi. The servers are very nice as well and it's a comfortable atmosphere.  Definitely go again, just not when you're hungry LOL"}
{"text":"Katsu done right! This location serves the best Katsu around.

Location is impressive and staff go above and beyond in terms of service and friendliness. Portions are generous and delicious. If you're craving Katsu, look no further, Katsuya will fill ALL your desires."}
{"text":"Dined here after attending an event at Ryerson University tonight.  I ordered the Fish Katsu with Katsuya Original sauce, my friend the Cheese Katsu (cheese and pork) with Hot Chili sauce, and we shared the Curry Karaage Thigh appetizer. We thought the fried chicken appetizer would come with curry sauce (hence I didn't go for the curry sauce for my main..) but it didn't. When we asked if it was forgotten, the server said that the curry was infused in the batter.. it was still a decent dish though. As for the mains, I wasn't too thrilled with the original sauce but really enjoyed the chili sauce. The chili paired really well with the cheese and pork and I can say I would come back and order this one again. The sauce you pick really makes a difference. I may come back to try the curry sauce too. I rate this first experience a 3 and my friend a 4."}
{"text":"Came here after a fitness competition about a month ago and was looking forward to this meal for weeks!!!!!! Unfortunately, our server got some of our order wrong and I was so upset but the manager on the floor took over and made everything so perfect again. There was a sushi roll that I ordered that I will never forget. It had truffle oil. I LOVED it. I am sad though because I will be going to the Katsuya in Miami and they do not carry that roll on their menu :-( Wish they did! I could eat it everyday. Thank you for a turn around and making the night better to whoever the floor manager is on Saturday nights! You were wonderful and the sushi was delicious."}
{"text":"Take Japanese variations of chicken primavera with a side of steamed rice and cabbage salad you get Katsuya. 

This was a last minute reservation for a group of 8 but I was content the staff was able to accomodate our group on such short notice! vs kinka Izakaya didn't even respond to any of my phone calls. A short walk away from St Michael's hospital through Ryerson's campus. 

We were greeted by a very friendly staff. The decor was cute- with a small intimate atmosphere. There were a lot of students in and out of the place. The tables were high styled. The menus were simple and I liked how the menu gives a little introduction about their main dishes & sides. I was happy to see a yelp Check-In deal - get a free soft drink! 

I ordered the chicken teri mayo dish that was in the sweeter side. It was topped worth flaky pastry paper that looked so beautiful dancing in my food - it was quite entertaining. The dish was great and was very filling! You will be taking home leftovers! I was so happy to hear we had unlimited servings of miso soup, rice and salad! I only took advantage of this deal with one refill of miso soup - I was stuffed. 
And my meal only cost me 17$! 

A meal on a budget is a star in my Toronto books!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious experience on our friends bday. We ordered several rolls, saki and dessert for the bday boy. I visited several Katsuya locations in LA and was surprised to find that this location was decorated as nicely (minus 1 star) or as busy. The food was delicious though and consistent with my other Katsuya experiences and the food taste/quality was as expected."}
{"text":"Came here for a late Friday dinner with another fellow Yelpie! The food was fantastic! I'm a huge katsu person and had been craving any sort of katsu dish almost every week. Of all the places that I've gone, Katsuya definitely takes the cake. The menu is small which I loved because it made making my choice for dinner a lot easier but each page also had a picture of the dish. You can also choose your choice of protein so if you prefer chicken over pork that's another great option. 

The curry karage chicken thigh appetizer was very delicious and so is the miso soup (free refills!). For dinner I ordered the Terri Mayo Katsu which was topped with Bonito Flakes. It was really delicious and although I only ate half, it was definitely still delicious the next day. My friend ordered the carbonara katsu which I think was a very unique twist to your typical katsu. This dish was a lot tastier than I had originally expected and would definitely order it for myself the next time I go. 

If you're craving some katsu, this resto is definitely the place to go. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Must come if you want fusion-Japanese katsu taste! Varieties of flavours makes me come back!"}
{"text":"After the manager reached out about our experience last time, we decided to give them another try and have to say our experience was way more positive this time around.  Hostess was really nice and sat us right away at one of the tables with couches on one side.  Our server came to our table right away and introduced her self and recommended drinks to us.  My sister got the jalapeño cucumber drink that she loved.  I was a little under the weather and coughing so she asked if I wanted hot water with lemon which helped my cough.  We started with the Goyza and Japanese fried chicken which were both really good and beautiful presentation. We also ordered 4 over rolls which were all really good. My favorite were the corn crunch roll and rock shrimp tempura roll.  Our server also recommended the warm chocolate cake with ice cream and fruit sauce which was absolutely delicious.  We had such a great time and can't wait to come back and try happy hour."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for cutlets and am quite picky however this location exceeded my expectations in flavour. I have try their spicy garlic (the garlic was a little too overpowering) and their cream katsu. I prefer the cream and can't wait to try their many other options on the menu. The atmosphere is laid back and retro. Definitely has a down-to-earth vibe. Servers are friendly and quick. I would definitely recommend this location if you enjoy cutlets."}
{"text":"This place was small but the food was great. I had the creamy carbonara udon (so good) and my boyfriend had the carbonara pork tenderloin with rice  service was also great! We will be back"}
{"text":"FOOD: 5/5 -  I was here with my family during winter time and was very pleased with the food here at Katsuya. I ordered the Carbonara cream sauce and seafood with katsu (pork cutlet). I'm a big fan of creamy and cheesy things so this was a great combo for me! The pork cutlet was huge! And very crispy yet tender at the same time. We also ordered the original curry with cheese and teriyaki with cheese. They were all delicious in their own way. Not only did we feel full from the meal itself but we were surprised to know that we also got unlimited miso soup and rice on top! This was one of the rare times where you get BOTH quality AND quantity in one place!

SERVICE:4.5/5 - Cheerful and attentive staffs even though we kept ordering more miso soups and wanted hot water instead of cold water. 

ENVIRONMENT: 4/5 - A hip, modern environment with wooden decors and tables. Though, the seats aren't the most comfortable to sit on. They were also playing anime on the TV when we visited."}
{"text":"MUST GET: CARBONARA KATSU.

Katsuya is probably my favourite place for Japanese Katsu! 

They have several options besides the Original, including Garlic Spicy Katsu and my all time favourite - Carbonara Katsu. In addition to the katsu, you get bottomless soup, rice and salad, which is perfect when you're looking for a filling meal on a cold winter's day. The katsu portion itself is quite large. You can get pork loin, pork tender, chicken katsu, cheese, double cheese, and fish katsu. We ordered a variety, and I still preferred the basic pork loin katsu.

Definitely worth coming here!"}
{"text":"Katsuya on Gerrard is such a cute restaurant located just above the stairs on Gerrard. A group of three of us came for dinner around 5:30pm on a Monday and it was pretty quiet. 

The interior is pretty modern - I really like the stools with room to put your bag inside. Immediately after ordering, we received hot miso soups. Yum! And then I found out its bottomless! OMG. We ordered the original and the carbonara. You have to get the original - which will be your reference point. Then when you taste that carbonara....it's got so much flavour and a kick of spiciness. Two of the katsus were enough for three of us. And then, get this, I found out the rice and salad is also bottomless! DAAAAAMMMNNN. BOOM 5 STARS."}

Don't forget to order a specialty cocktail.. these bartenders know how to mix a drink!!! Well done to all the staff!! Loved!"}
{"text":"Good value for money. We tried the curry karaage thigh, crispy and mildly flavored...fried fresh oysters, good too...our favorite was the cheese crabmeat croquettes. We also got 5 different kinds of katsu...my favorite was the original. Check out my pictures and my opinion on the dishes."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this 10 stars... It is my absolute favorite restaurant and I would go there everyday if I could.  I've tried mostly everything on their menu and I've never enjoyed eating more than when I've eaten here.  I would walk 500 miles barefoot through the hot vegas desert for a bite of that Wagyu fried rice... or the corn tempura... or the sushi... or the balsamic kale appetizer... basically all the food there.  I go there every year and it's an amazing experience every single time.  The staff there is really nice and attentive too! This is really as good as it gets. If you're ever in Vegas... You NEED to stop here."}
{"text":"Came to Katsuya for lunch around 1230. We were seated very quickly.  

We ordered the pork tender katsu (the waitress said it's softer than the pork loin katsu.) It came with miso soup and a salad which was nice, I didn't know it's a lunch set. We also ordered the chicken karrage. The karrage had an unusual flavour (Too garlicky?? I don't remember now but I thought it tasted weird.)"}
{"text":"Took my dad out for lunch today. He is old and set in his ways, which is a true testament to the quality and flavours of Katsuya. The staff are very warm and inviting, as well as accommodating. We were seated right away and water as well as a dish of homemade pickles were placed on the table right away. Water was nice and cold too! 
Portions are huge. I ordered the crab and cheese croquettes. I expected there to be 2, maybe 3 in the dish. I was pleasantly surprised when dish arrived with 5 large croquettes and they were delicious! Not greasy at all, crispy and hot filled with gooey cheese. 
Both of us had the curry katsu chicken. The chicken was tender with a delicious, crispy coating. The curry gravy is different than I have had before as it has braised onion in it, but it was just as delicious as everything else. The steamed rice was perfect. 
I will be back here, once I finish what I had to take away as, like I wrote earlier, the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Loved it! We ordered katsu OG, carbonara, and Japanese original. Also got the takoyaki to start. Everything was really yummy. The carbonara sauce is a bit heavy for me but if you like rich and spicy then this is for you! You can get sauce on the side which I recommend since I had to get part of my katsu to go! Would come back again"}
{"text":"We've tried few things from their menu and found the fusion interesting, though most didn't leave too much of an impression. Theirs doesn't quite have the crunch I look for in a katsu, especially when drenched in sauces. 
Portion is bigger than other places, like Mr. Tonkatsu and the price is fair based on that. But I have had better."}
{"text":"Kept us waiting for food for over half an hour. Said they were having trouble with the fryer in the kitchen. When the food firnally arrived, it was nothing special, looked like it had been cold and cooked a while ago :(
Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We went for social hour. Good we did because I would not pay the regular prices (even though food was good). The fried shrimp were tasty but too fried tasting for me after a few (what did I expect). Seaweed salad was good, but cut a little too small for my taste. We got the corn crunch roll. Good flavor but the corn wasn't crunchy enough for my liking, it seemed a little soggy. We also got the unagi and cucumber roll. I don't like that avocado seemed to be an add on instead of standard in rolls as it should be in my opinion. Server was good and it was fun to sit at the sushi bar, but I thought it was overpriced and overrated. I would go again if we were here and wanted sushi but it wouldn't be my first choice, especially for the price point."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit very much!! It's a small restaurant, but I love the cozy/authentic vibe they have going on. Their menu has unique dishes and I enjoyed my dish a lot. We ordered fries w/ honey butter powder, pork loin carbonara katsu, and the white snow chili pork loin katsu. The katsu dishes came with cabbage, ginger, and a side of rice. They also give you unlimited miso soup (which is my fav!!) Having the fries on the side was very nice as it was a nice break from the katsu, I highly recommend having both at the same time. The servers were nice. I would definitely come back and try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Spicy Garlic Katsu, where have you been all my life? The staff was also very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious. Not particularly cheap but the portions are pretty big. We were told not to get the double stuffed and just got the one... So good! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best place to start of a girls night out. Had an amazing time celebrating my grilfriends birthday and I have to say their costumer service was great. Server was very attentive and the manager made sure everything was going well."}
{"text":"Starting off with a cocktail from the bar I reached towards the Watermelon Cucumber Mojito made by Sean. He was quick to make our cocktails while making conversation with me and my two girlfriends. The cocktail was amazing. It was very light & refreshing. We didnt have to ask but he made some suggestions from the menu that he thought we should try. 

As all five of us were seated at our table, we noticed the table was wobbly. Instead of putting something under it to control the wobble they had to move us which was kind of inconvenient already. Our server was Wombo who was very kind and had good knowledge of the menu. Some of the girls ordered appetizers to start then entrees later. One of the main issues I had was the food not coming out in any specific order and also very slow. The first set of items we ordered came all at different times and even some after our entrees. I did not enjoy my other friends eating their food while I watched and by the time I got my food, they were done. I had Edamame, Creamy Rock Shrimp, Tuna Tataki Roll and Miso marinated Black Cod. All were good. We were sent a round of sparkling wine compliments of Katsuya. Im not sure if that was for all the tables or because everything wasnt going smoothly. One of the Chef's came by to make sure everything was ok. His name is Derek Powers. He invited us back promising to make our experience better. They didnt have dessert menu's but Wombo told us what they had. We ordered the dessert platter with green tea creme brulee, chocolate molten cake and lychee ice cream. The small ice cream cones were presented in a plastic holder with two very tiny holes that did not hold them because the second the runner placed it down while warning us, it fell over. He mentioned its been an issue but it hasnt been fixed. We were suppose to get our cones replaced since they fell on the table and we were only brought one. We mentioned that both fell and came back with two more.

Overall, The food was 4 stars and the service was 3 stars. Our server was great the entire time and very apologetic about all the issues we had."}
{"text":"The food is not bad. There are lots of selection in terms of favor and meat choice. The portion is big. And you will have free miso soup.
However, I found that it is a bit pricy. Average menu price is about $16-18 for a katsu with a little bit salad on the side. I don't think I will go back again."}
{"text":"Super amazing place! Omg!! I have to say the Wagyu steak with Foie Gras is in my top 3 steak dishes of all time!
The red wine reduction was just perfect. The steak and Foie Gras were \"melt in your mouth\" delicious!!!
The staff was very attentive and professional.
Julie, my server, was friendly and on top of everything I needed.
Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Wowie Wow Wow.  The Very Best black Cod that I have ever tasted. It was like eating butterfish & the portion size was VERY generous. The wagyu beef was so tasty & tender. The Sushi platter was very colorful & the ginger was primo quality! 
Servers are so helpful, happily checking in, making suggestions, & inciting our party to return soon.  The sweets are so fresh & tasty.  This restaurant is such a bonus for the SLS casino. It makes the casino definitely worth going to!"}
{"text":"I know I'm being a bit picky here, but the advertising hype and talk of Katsuya being the best place for sushi in Vegas just reminds me that Vegas is in the middle of the desert and not a city for sushi.

The shishito peppers were a bit oily and not quite as snappy as I am used to, although adding a dash of coarse salt helped the flavor. As for the sushi itself, the yellowtail was only decent, but the shrimp and tuna were both excellent. I was definitely disappointed by the fact that the wasabi was the same green horseradish found at almost every other sushi restaurant although with better texture. I know asking for fresh wasabi is a tall order, but my expectations were high coming in.

Quite honestly if it hadn't been hyped so much, I'd be rating Katsuya a 4/5, but whatever happened with the shishito peppers was just a total disappointment. I get better than that in Oklahoma on a regular basis. Maybe that's a touch unfair, but I tend to rate places for what they are rather than comparing high end Japanese dining to a hole in the wall restaurant.

Also to their credit, the servers were great."}
{"text":"We go here for happy hour every time we're at the SLS.  I'm not a sushi connoisseur, but I think it's great food/drinks at a great price.  I've never had a problem getting a seat at the bar and the food comes out really fast.  If you want your items in a particular order, you should specify that (we ordered everything at once and got the edamame at the end which I thought was a little odd)."}
{"text":"The Skinny: mushy rice, hit or miss seasoning depending on the dish makes this joint an okay for me(3), service was okay but not extraordinary by any means(3) value: we came on Social Sundays (50% off for locals)so prices were more reasonable but for full price...I'd pass.(3)

We came for Social Sunday for locals which gives 50% off food and beverages to certain restaurants at the SLS. This week it was Katsuya. FYI - the Omakase Geta, A4 robata and the Toro is not included in this promotion.

Spicy Tuna Crispy rolls: 4 pieces for $16 is a bit pricey for this dish. The maguro used was okay but the rice was too soft, over seasoned. The crispy rice wasn't quite crispy enough. Pass.

Lobster Chawan mushi with truffles: texturally it was nice and silky. Flavorwise, the truffle wasn't really there. (Actually all their truffle dishes didn't taste at all like truffles-I think they used Chinese truffles which look similar but have no flavor) The sauce on top was rather overly salty although the dish did improve after scooping up from the very bottom of the cup. Kinda of a meh dish for me.

Vegetable tempura consisted of about 10 small pieces of mushrooms, asparagus, sweet potato and zucchini. Nothing special except the exorbitant price.

Brussel sprouts, fried with dashi and vinegar were delicious. The crispy texture matched well with the nuts and mildly sweet glaze.  and definitely the best dish of the night.

Kakuni (\"stewed pork belly\"): sent it back because it was an entirely large piece of pork fat without little to no meat on it. Would not recommend.

Wagyu beef with Foie Gras: served with an overly sweet sauce, the dish lacked balance and could have used a bit more salt. The beef was perfectly cooked though and the foie had a nice sear to it. It was okay but not worth full price.

Tuna Tataki roll: too much sauce, mushier sushi rice caused the roll to break apart easily. The amount of tuna was generous enough though. Meh, don't need to order this again.

Omakase sashimi: the quality of the fish was very good however the serving size was rather small given the price.

Given the level of the cuisine we experienced, it is definitely not worth the full price of admission. There are definitely better sushi restaurants in the city at more reasonable prices too. (3-starred review)"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Vegas !! Simply amazing, coming back ASAP."}
{"text":"Had the Katsuya Original Pork Loin while my two friends had the Katsuya Original Cheese Katsu and the Sweet Chili Double Cheese Katsu. The sauces were very flavourful and enjoyable. I really enjoyed the original sauce and thought the sweet chili sauce was definitely a good option too. I thought that my pork loin was a little dry, was definitely expecting something juicier. I found the ones with cheese to be more tender. The breading was also falling apart from the pork. Though the sauces were good, I would also say that the it makes the katsu soggy and the breading is quickly gone. They also have free refills of soup, salad, and rice - which is great if you want more. 

Staff were friendly and nice. Overall it was ok, but not sure if I'd go again."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here and it was more than anyone expected; This was hands-down the best sushi I've ever had in my life! Favorites of the night were: Tuna Crispy Rice, Brussel Sprouts, Sashimi w/ Fried Onions, Seaweed Salad, and their rolls are to die for. Also, their birthday dessert platter is so incredible (recommending the cheesecake). The service was immaculate as well. Go to Katsuya for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends on a saturday night and was greeted with a nice warm welcoming in Korean. The food was amazing. Pretty good portions. I had the the original katsu. The sauce was amazing. It came with unlimited rice, cabbage salad & miso soup.  The atmosphere was very warm and welcoming ."}
{"text":"The food was great and the server was really nice. Definitely would come back here again. The portions are really big. I had the terrimayo with cheese katsu and it was really delicious."}
{"text":"We tried their original katsu with cheese and the Japanese traditional katsu. The original katsu with cheese was heavy but so delicious - highly recommend. The Japanese traditional katsu was good, but we prefer the one from Mr. Tonkatsu. So I would say to stick to the katsu's with sauce."}
{"text":"Katsuya is one of the top choices for katsu dishes in the heart of North York. They often a range of meat, from pork, to chicken and to fish. There are also a lot of choices on the type of sauce, for example, garlic chili, curry, carbonara, to name a few. 

We ordered the Pork Loin Katsu and a side order of curry karage chicken wings. Both were a delish, with really tasty breading.

The waitress was really friendly and she also offered an extra bowl of miso soup, when our order only suppose to come with one.

You can check in here with your instagram/facebook for a free pop as well. Smart marketing idea ;)"}
{"text":"Small restaurant with seating for about 30.

Ordered the original pork tenderloin katsu. Fairly large cutlet, decent thickness as well. I found the meat somewhat dry here and there. The breading coated on top is very light and crunchy. Half of the cutlet is covered in curry sauce, while the other half is bare, allowing you to taste both offerings. I find the meat itself doesn't have much flavor if you choose to eat the naked side, but the texture and the sauce make up for it I suppose.

The sauce itself is quite flavorful, somewhat sweet somewhat salty. Definitely lots of things going into their sauce.

If you order the combo, they provide unlimited miso soup, cabbage, and rice if you like to eat at a balanced rate.

Some people might not like the idea of having all that sauce all over the meat cause it loses its crisp, but it wasn't that big of a deal to me. You could probably request to have the sauce on the side to see what happens."}
{"text":"Truthfully, I would give them 0 stars but it requires you to rate. Myself and two friends of mine visited Katsuya on our first night staying at the SLS hotel and were so excited to try the decadent menu that only THIS location had to offer. Needless to say, the service was incredibly terrible. Our dishes took an hour to come out, with little to no attention from anyone that worked in the restaurant. The food was cold, the drinks took 15-20 minutes to get... we even watched the server stand at the bar laughing and talking with the bartender while our drinks sat there. So disappointing. 
The icing on the cake: when our server went to cash out our bill, I asked her take the $80 in cash and put the rest on the card I provided. She comes back having charged the card for the full amount ($200), and the cash was gone. I still am waiting for that pending charge to fall off, as she had to run my card again for the amount that should've been charged initially! 
I work in service, I've worked in the retail industry for 15+ years, 5 of them I served at a handful of busy bars/restaurants that required high patience and your full attention. My party visiting Katsuya was not high maintenance nor did we want to be a nuisance. It would have been easy to take care of our party, seriously. 
Such a bad experience. Never again!"}
{"text":"I've got to hand it to Jessica, she was prompt and persistent about getting this right. Yes I was sick yes it was raw fish, so I don't who's to blame. The food its self was actually good and he service was good. I guess I was just unlucky. I appreciate the customer service and the fact that they wanted to make things right."}
{"text":"Had the curry chicken katsu, slight amount of spice and the flavour was not too overpowering. Fills the Japanese curry fix that I was having. You get a huge piece of katsu when you order so be hungry!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars

I was in the area and looked on Yelp to find a good spot for a quick bite.  Decided to check it out because of all the positive reviews.

The katsu was pretty good but not great.  I had the curry flavour which was again ok, not great.  The accompanying rice was a cold lump and the \"salad\" was shredded cabbage with some dressing.  My katsu was a little over $20 with tax/tip, I think 25% overpriced for what I got.

When I was done, I wondered why/how this place could get such high ratings...and then I figured it out.  They give discounts to guests who show them they put up a positive Yelp review.  I get it - they are trying to spread the word.  But Yelp should indicate somewhere if the restaurant provides \"Yelp incentives\" or the like.  Don't get me wrong - this place wasn't bad, but it's Yelp rating is misleading."}
{"text":"It's rare that you find a restaurant outside Japan that cares so much about their cuisine. Their fish, in particular, is as varied as it is fresh. Not a hint of fishiness from the maguro, Suzuki, hirame, or amberjack. The uni was rich without any bitterness, and the marbling in the chu honmaguro would have converted my religion was I not already a Sushitarian. Stephan, in particular, was knowledgable, friendly, and deft with his knife. Too many American sushi chefs don't know that it's okay to have fun while partaking! Overall this is a diamond for sure, but not in the rough! I'll be back, and with friends."}
{"text":"So we had the original Japanese double cheese Katsu as well as the carbonara Katsu. They were both really good and tasty. I really recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great food, great service. I specially loved their oolong tea and jalapeño martini. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food and experience. We were able to make bar-side RSVPs with Jonathon weeks before, and he was professional enough to stop by and greet our party of 3 once we were seated. Thanks Jonathon!

Excellent service and great food. The Brussell sprouts, pork belly, and the yellowtail with jalepeno were standouts. Kept to the happy hour menu for the most part and it was all awesome.

Sushi Roku has been our usual Sushi stop for Happy Hour, now Katsuya is #1.

Don't forget to ask for the free Yelp check-in crispy rice with spicy tuna: it was very unique and tasty. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Katsu?!?!? Ya!!!! This place is a hidden gem around the corner from izakaya! They have unlimited soup salad and rice with your meal and the service was just amazing. I came here with a group of 27 people on a Sunday after church. They sat us at separate tables which was perfectly reasonable and everybody got their menus and ordered different kinds of katsu. I had the carbonara katsu which was very heavy with cheese and everything came with soup salad and rice. Also ordered the deep fried fresh oysters which was pretty crispy. 

The servers are really friendly and happy and the portions are enormous! 

The decor here is very nice and industrial with exposed brick walls and wood stools and chairs. Very appropriate for the ambience here. 

The location is a bit hidden as it is off of Gerrard and and not church. 

Food came pretty fast and overall a great experience for a group of 27 people! 

The only down is the price which is a bit expensive for lunch. Around $18 with tax for one katsu meal. It's pretty big so would recommend sharing the meal with someone else if you're not a big eater. 

Either way, we will be back!"}
{"text":"If ask me of a katsu restaurant in uptown I'll always recommend Katsuya. The portion is very generous. Normally I'm not able to finish all of them and pack up the leftover for my next day lunch. 

We order Tako wasabi as the appetizer. The wasabi flavour is light and good. But the seaweed is rather too small, making it difficult to wrap the tako up.

Katsuya offer x types of sauces to add on your katsu. Also you can choose from loin, tender, chicken and etc. to make a customized meal. The meal come with a miso soup, sliced cabbage and steamed rice as sides. Doesn't it sounds great?

I choose the carbonara loin katsu. The sauce tastes awesome and the pork loin is very crunchy. I like this kind of heavy and smooth taste very much.

The place only accepts debit card and cash. The staff there are all very friendly. Overall a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Fantastic katsu place in north York. If you don't want to go all the way downtown to mr tonkatsu then this place might be an even better alternative with plenty of different sauces to choose from for your tonkatsu. We tried the Japanese curry and original sauce tonkatsu and were delighted by the dishes. It was a large serving too and we couldn't finish it all and packed it to go. For an appetizer we got the curry chicken karaage and it was delicious! Even better than our current fave of sansotei karaage.

Parking is limited but there is street parking after 4pm."}
{"text":"We ordered a chicken and a pork tender katsu. Both were delicious!! I loved how tender and juicy the meat was and how light and crisp the breading was. The sauces (sweet chili and original) were yummy, but make sure you ask for them on the side if you don't want soggy breading. Most importantly, I liked how there wasn't strong onion flavours in their sauces or salad dressing. The portion sizes were huge and definitely was filling!! Overall, I enjoyed the interior and the food."}
{"text":"Oh I'm just salivating thinking about the fried chicken cutlet! Katsuya is known for their delicious Japanese katsu (panko chicken) and good service. And this time was no different with excellent service! I got the Katsuya original with chicken. The sauce tasted like a butternut squash soup with other fruits and vegetables but it mainly tasted like butternut. I appreciate how they use fresh ingredients and rotate the vegetables and fruits they use. Even though the taste won't be consistent, the freshness and work that went into making it does! I also love how the dishes are made to order which partially justifies the price along with the ingredients they use.

I would say the Katsuya original with chicken was a 3.5/5 and it was partially my fault as I should have gotten something more savoury and saltier. My friend got the terri mayo pork loin and wooooow, it was a solid 5. The curry one was also good with a creamy sauce. So I would recommend the teriyaki pork loin katsuya and next time I will definitely get that one!

Once again, service was great with delicious lemon water (fancy!), window seats, and polite greetings! Would totally return again."}
{"text":"I HAVE STAYED AT THE SLS HOTEL religiously for the past three years and a highlight of my stay has the Katsuya restaurant.  I usually attend to the happy hour from 5 - 7 pm and the first thing that is impressive is that I see the familiar faces I have grown to be accustomed and feel at home. The bartenders that have been very good always are Alice, Dana, and Jose.

While all three are exceptional , one whom I admire is Jose who is an apprentice bartender.  Jose (from Mexico) is the friendliest bartender and has such drive that I know he will be a success to any  organization.  Customer service comes almost naturally to Jose and this is a characteristic hard to find. 

BTW- did I mention that the drinks at Katsuya are amazing.   I have never had a bad drink here - the bartenders have their act together.  I live in Miami and the Katsuya here beats out Miami any day."}
{"text":"Stayed at the W for a conference and ended the night quietly at Katsuya. Never been keen on chains, but the food wasn't too shabby. Ordered: a bottle of Sapporo, Hamachi roll, & seafood Yakisoba. It was also entertaining overhearing a guy sitting next to me at the sushi bar, who claimed how much he loved Japan and Katsuya is the place to go for Japanese food in Vegas??"}
{"text":"Amazing rock shrimp. The chicken defiantly superior to what I have had in the past. Execution was excellent. The wavy steak amazing. They defiantly hit on all sides of the board, the food is pricey for what it really is, but it's vegas defiantly no regrets."}
{"text":"Katsuya is one of the best hidden gems you'll find in Las Vegas for sushi, Japanese whiskies and service. The service was top notch from the hostess, to our server Matt, all the way to the bussers, food runners and even the manager who stopped by tables to check how everything was going. Everyone was very knowledgeable about each product they brought out and we didn't feel rushed with the perfect timing of each item we ordered. Which brings me to the food - INCREDIBLE! Katsuya has some of the best sashimi quality I've had in Vegas. You can tell the chef is very talented and each dish highlights the flavor profile of the fish. Don't skip out on Katsuya - it's a must if you're near the strip!"}
{"text":"really nice chef and wait staff. wish i could give 4 stars but the food was meh (hi, sushi snob over here). 

there was just too much rice and it wasn't anything special. the prices are quite high as well. i had the yellowtail with jalapeno, crispy roll, and mochi."}
{"text":"I've dined at many sushi restaurants around Las Vegas and I'm glad I finally got the opportunity to check out Katsuya!!  Wow! I was definitely impressed from the second the host introduced herself to closing out our tab.  Our waitress Julie was so professional and convincing, it opened us up to try everything she recommended on and off the menu.  The presentation, the flavors, and the textures of food were all amazing!  Every person at the table had nothing but positive things to say about their experience.  The energy, presence of the restaurant was very comfortable, elegant, and refined .  Even the music was on point.  Bottom line, just ask Julie :) and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Small portions, very expensive. Extremely loud environment. Skip it. Plenty of better places. The ONLY bad meal I've ever had in Las Vegas. 

Got the chef's choice sashimi. Got a few small bites.  Still hungry.  Fish I got was fine, but precious little of it. Fine I get it. This is your best stuff so you're going to be very sparing with it. But it also was presented very carelessly. Came in one small serving. Thought maybe they'd put a little flare in the presentation for $55 a person -- a couple plates brought out in sequence. Some small thing to start. No!  Dropped one plate for me and one for my guest, rushed through the description of what's what and left us to our disappointment. The one she said was halibut (and I asked specifically) didn't seem like halibut to me. But who knows.  No starch anywhere to be found. A little blob of seaweed propping up some of the fish.  You get the fish, pay a fortune per bite, and better be happy with that. Well im not.  

Ordered dessert. Got a bland little tart with a second rate sorbet. Sorbet wasn't smooth--still frozen pretty hard.  Had a bit of rock sugar type stuff on the top, which was  tasteless.  Pretty blah. 

Service wasn't bad. Glasses were kept full. Things were delivered promptly. 

The environment was as mentioned very noisy. I couldn't hear my guest. 

Not going back.  Contemplating what I'm going to eat now that I'm home since I'm still fairly hungry. $170 btw for two people including meager tip (meager %wise because it was a ripoff). One can of beer was the only alcohol. What a huge f***ing ripoff.  I was EXTREMELY pissed off paying that bill.  I walked out of there hungry, angry, and ready to Yelp :)"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!
Happy hour is a must!!!
Sahara and crunch roll are delicious.  
All the specialty drinks on the happy hour menu are orgasmic!!!
Definitely give this place a try! You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I went alone to Katsuya after work during their social hour. Between 5 pm to 7pm, the social hour  has many of their dishes at half price. The sushi rolls are the same quality and size, however their sashimi are slightly smaller.

I ordered my food at 6:55pm and most of my good came out within 10 minutes. The food service was extremely fast while maintaining great quality.

My server was really nice and honest. I asked him that I have a certain budget, should I order off regular menu or social hour. He responded with social hour as they only reduce th  price but not the quality of the food. I really appreciated his honesty.

I ended up ordering the nigiri sampler, albacore sashimi with crispy onion, the tuna taki roll, the tuna tataki with crispy onion, and the Sahara roll. Their rolls and nigiri were great (4/5), but their sashimi were amazing (5/5). The sashimi were just so flavourful and fresh.

In retrospective, I woild just order 4 plates of sashimi and one plate of the nigiri sampler.

I'd try this place again during social hour! Not sure how I'd feel paying full price as the menu gets fairly pricey!"}
{"text":"I would remove a star due to no air conditioning but I can't because the service and food were too good! I got the Teri Mayo pork loin (after I got their original katsuya in their downtown location) and this one was way better! I'm unsure but the pork cutlet here was much bigger than the one I had downtown. The portion was excellent, miso soup was delicious, and you will definitely be full with unlimited refills of miso soup, cabbage/salad, and rice. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Visited Katsuya during our vacation stay and it was absolutely perfect! The food was hands down the best we've had the entire time we were in Vegas. We loved the crispy rice spicy tuna and the rolls were to die for!! Ambiance was lovely and a good spot for groups. Def got this place up for a grab before going out. Service was amazing from beginning to end! The manager, Jessica helped us with getting checked in and told us about some great spots in the hotel to check out as well as some lounges to go to. Thanks Katsuya!"}
{"text":"No exaggeration, best sushi I have ever had and service was amazing will definitely be coming back next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"AmaIng value. The katsu is really big and the rice, miso soup and salad are unlimited. We had the curry katsu and spicy katsu. It's a bit on the sweet side but if you like sweet sauces this place is for you. I enjoyed the Honey butter fries and my brother loved the takoyaki. Great service and I love how there's a lot of wood and warm lighting in the restaurant. Highly recommend, especially for students in the area. It's a nice place if you're very hungry. One thing to note is that they do not serve any alcohol."}
{"text":"This place is pricy ($14-$18), you can get the same quality food with 1/3 of their price. Food is OK, very average, wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"This Japanese-Korean style dish was a king of katsu.  This katsu is a decadent dish with fried, breaded pork topped with sweet chilli, mozzarella and cheddar cheese.  The breaded pork was moist and tender on the inside and golden brown and crisp on the outside.  Chilli sauce, mozzarella and cheddar cheese added a special flavour altogether made this a top-notch, second to none katsu dish.  Mmm...so lit..
Thanks @katsuya_toronto for the excellent service and flavourful katsu.  I will definitely come back to try other katsu dishes."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! From the host to the waiters and especially the sushi chefs! Everybody is so kind and food is flawless! The sushi here melts in your mouth. By far the freshest sushi I've ever had in Vegas. The cooked food selection is also delicious. I can't even begin to recommend anything because everything taste THAT good. But if I must, I'd say the uni sushi, Gyoza appetizer, omakasa sushi, Katsuya roll and chicken salad are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Ironically not the food or the service disappointed me.  It was the menu and \"the rules\".  I wanted 3 or 4 pieces of Maguro sashimi as an appetizer.  Nope - you get 7 explained the server.  I only want 3 or 4....   Ok I'll skip an appetizer.  Response: OK Sir.  Seriously???   Who's the customer here?   And isn't Japanese about fresh food - as you want, as you order?  Not impressed- at all.  As good as the food might be, I'll not return. 

Rules are for playgrounds - not restaurants."}
{"text":"Prices are a little high compared to other places, although it's pretty reasonable because their sauces are exceptional.
 I don't really like the starters though, because their katsu is so much better"}
{"text":"Saldana sushi is a little hole on the wall but it is definitely a hidden deliciousness treasure. I bring my friends and family and we all found that everything here is prepared to perfection and we loved everything we have ordered. You want to eat good and not waste a lot? Be sure to try Sakana!"}
{"text":"i purchased three orders today and i found a very long hair stick with the rice when was eating it. it is really disgusting,worst experience. I deeply doubt the 4.5 stars rating ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are from SoCal but we come to Vegas every now and then for fun. We actually loved the SLS hotel itself but the food here is absolutely delicious, it's definitely something I would go back to. I don't remember much of the service but the food itself was worth the price for us."}
{"text":"Love this place , went here for a broker party and the food was so good we ce back for happy hour.  The rock shrimp is ridiculously good , the Brussel sprouts out of this world and the crispy rice with spicy ahi, is my absolute favorite,  other places do it but Katsuya does it better than any other place in town !! The hand crafted cocktails were refreshing and I can't wait to go back !!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner. We ordered the crab croquette to share. The outside was crispy and inside was soft and cheesy. The mayo sauce on top was really tasty and made the whole dish creamy. 

The katsu was pretty good but not as tender and juicy as I would like it to be. Large portion and crispy. The japanese curry was also creamy. There is unlimited refill of soup, cabbage and rice if you ask but with the portions you already received, it's not really necessary. One down side was the rice was a little bit too soft for my liking. 

Space is kind of tight and parking is limited (even in the back). Reasonable price. Good service."}
{"text":"Food - The katsu sauces are really interesting and the katsu itself is really good. I personally liked the one filled with cheese!

Service - Excellent service!

Decor - Clean and modern looking.

Cons - The inside is pretty small and parking is ridiculous."}
{"text":"4.5/5

Came here with a party of 4, around 7:30 pm on a Tuesday night. I arrived late, but my group already had a table and it seemed there was no wait. The atmosphere is quite casual and they had Howl's Moving Castle playing on the TV as well! One thing I noticed right away was that service was very attentive and enthusiastic. Seeing that there were so many styles of katsu being offered, I asked for some recommendations: original, sweet chili, and the curry, as well as the pork tender. You pick the sauce, and then pick the type of meat that you want for your katsu. 

Ordered the original chicken katsu while others ordered original pork tender, sweet chili pork tender and curry chicken. The food came quickly and the katsu portion was definitely a plus (half our party couldn't finish). Rice, salad and soup have free refills as well! The katsu was very crispy and tasted very light, and was consistent across all of our plates. The servers made sure to ask us throughout if we were enjoying our food and if we needed refills. Will definitely return to try the different meats and sauces! 

If it is a busier time, parking might be an issue. Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant, love to visit again! Always go and grab lunch here. The chicken Katsu was the best katsu I've ever had! Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We ordered cheese crab croquette and that's a bomb!  Pork Tenderloin cooked perfect!  Salad dressing is great. Definitely worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm huge fan of Katsu and the spin on the common dish from Japan is definitely genius. 

Food: If your looking for Tonkatsu done right, you are looking at coming to Katsuya. I have tried both the original tonkatsu and the chicken curry Katsu with cheese and definitely I can tell that it's a cut above any other Asian fusion joint trying to do Katsus'. 

Service: Staff is friendly and attentive which in my book is already five stars. Come on people this is technically Japanese fast food, can't expect much. 

Atmosphere: The joint is quite small, so expect wait times with regards to seating if it gets busy. I totally dig their decor and playing anime is also a nice touch for a laugh. 

Recommendation? Oh gawd yes! Seriously have to give props to the owner(s). Fantastic business venture and may I say... Please expand to Markham it will definitely do well as it is the Katsu joint we so desperately need."}
{"text":"Came to check out this new location with my friend on the Monday afternoon. I ordered the cheese katsu with curry sauce and my friend got the snow white with the sweet potato and cheese filling. We also ordered cheese crab croquette which was THE BOMB. I love the tartar sauce that they put on the croquette. The staffs were super friendly and always came to check in if we need anything. Everything tasted very yummy!"}
{"text":"This is a place that has exceeded my expectations in every way possible. I never thought much about don katsu but this restaurant has forever reshaped how I think about this dish.

I had donkatsu in Japan and Korea and I know it's a thing there. In Canada you can find this dish in many Korean and Japanese restaurants. But Katsuya elevates it to new levels. 

The first innovation is allowing different types of sauces. Most other places give you some standard sauce. Here, you can choose what sauce you want, and also what kind of meat you want (fish/chicken/pork). You can also choose things like adding extra cheese if you want. I've tried the original and also the cabonara and these are easily the best don katsu sauces I've ever had in my life.

The second thing that really impresses me is the price for value. The price here is more expensive but believe me when I say you more than get your money's worth. The amount of meat you get is easily 40-60% more than other places that sell don katsu. If you dine in, rice and miso soup are unlimited. You can't possibly leave here hungry. The prices are higher but totally reasonable and worth it.

I typically don't talk about service for Korean/Chinese run places but I must say this place has excellent service. The décor is nice too. If I have to nitpick, the only downside to this place is the parking space but that's out of their control and I don't hold it against them.

You absolutely must come here. It will change how you perceive don katsu forever. If you're not into don katsu, they also sell excellent fried chicken for very reasonable prices. Comes with 3 dipping sauces and all are excellent."}
{"text":"This place does NOT disappoint! GREAT drinks, great food and great service! 

Definitely try the jasmine pomegranate margaritas and any of the sushi rolls! The server brought us complimentary champagne to celebrate our engagement... made us feel VERY special!"}
{"text":"Best donkatsu i had.. Great service and enviroment.. Carbonara katsu is a must! Big portion tender meat and taste amazing :-D"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Came here for the second time for dinner tonight. Amazing food and service."}
{"text":"I must say this is my favourite Japanese curry in GTA!! I got the Original fish katsu and it was soooo good. The batter was light and you do get a decent size portion. The sauce was by far the best part - a bit sweeter than the one i tried in J-Town and if you were to use the curry bars you buy at T&T. Oh man it was perfect. Writing this makes me want to eat it now. It also comes with all you can eat rice, although i don't think you'll need it. The service was decently fast, and the servers were nice. Being on Yonge, parking could get a little more difficult as they only have two dedicated parking spots for the restaurant. There are some street parking right behind the restaurant, I believe."}
{"text":"Selection, service, hospitality - this place was great. Phenomenal food, great service with like 20 different people approaching your table to bring up yet another dish or refill glasses.

We were with a baby, which adds an additional layer of complexity in a Japanese place, but everybody from hostess to the waiters took great care of our experience. Will definitely come back.

Humble suggestion - the menu is generous as far and selection and everything looks good. Do something like an iPad version of it at the table - with each person ordering 5-6 dishes keeping track of them is hard."}
{"text":"I came back to Katsuya!  We arrived at around 5 p.m. on a Saturday and there were already people dining inside!  This time, I ordered the Curry Katsu with Double Cheese.  It was indeed very cheesy within the katsu.  The curry sauce was pretty good too.  Just like last time, the rice, miso soup, and salad were refillable.  I asked for a second round of miso soup because I found it so hot and comforting.  It wasn't salty either and I didn't find myself very thirsty after the two soups which was a good sign.  I also wasn't able to finish my portion this time so I took the katsu strips home.

K ordered the Spicy Garlic Katsu with the original Katsuya sauce.  The garlic one was also really good!  There were large slices of garlic on it and the garlic was very fragrant.  (It wasn't actually very spicy.)"}
{"text":"Food is great, portion is great, parking is very hard tho

I have heard the sides are free to refill but the original portion is already too large for me to finish, so I didn't opt for the refill."}
{"text":"I have never really been a fan of katsu, much to my BF's dismay since he's a katsu eating machine.  However, Katsuya earned two thumbs up from me.  My BF agrees and he's quite a katsu snob, mind you.  We have been to Mr. Tonkatsu from the same owner as Katsuya, but Mr. Tonkatsu was just barely decent to me from what I recall.  Katsuya, on the other hand, seems to up the ante on all aspects from portion size to quality to decor and so forth.  

Katsuya has various meats and a host of different styles that you don't find elsewhere in Toronto.  You can even get katsu udon or a katsu burger, so you're sure to have something that peaks your interest here. We ordered the Original and the Spicy Garlic Chilli.  Both came with rice, cabbage, and miso soup, all of which are refillable (for free), so rest assured that you're never going to leave with an empty stomach! Also, as mentioned by other Yelpers, the portion sizes are generous and the meat is tender with light breading.  I did not like the Original's sauce as much as my Spicy Garlic Chilli sauce because the former resembled Thanksgiving gravy for some odd reason.  However, this may just be me because my BF thoroughly enjoyed the Original's sauce.  In the end, both of us concluded that Katsuya serves flavourful, high quality katsu at a fair price and  higher quantity.

If you're a light eater, you may want to piggyback on someone else's order and share a katsu set with them.  You get refillable cabbage, miso soup, and rice anyway.  Nevertheless, the best choice is still to get your own set beacuse you won't want to stop eating the katsu.  Keep in mind, however, that the bottom of the katsu gets a tad bit soggy after a while, so don't save it for last. Eat it while it's fresh! 

I highly recommend everyone to give Katsuya a go! Their seating is limited to smaller groups of 4 and under, though it's not impossible for them to push tables together.  Remember to check in on social media and Yelp for a free can of pop!"}
{"text":"Great good!!!!, but they do not offer extra rice for taje out or delivery.. a drawback"}
{"text":"Best happy hour and my favorite sushi in Vegas.  Love everything about Katsuya. Food is always fresh and there is a bus Boy there who calls us \"my friend\" and we adore him. He is a ray of sunshine and makes us smile. They serve their rainbow roll with lime which I would have never thought to put lime on a sushi Roll and now I can't have a rainbow roll without lime.  The Chinese chicken salad is my favorite. It comes really cold and the dressing is so good. Highly recommend the rock shrimp as well.  We hope it doesn't close down with the change of ownership of the sls."}
{"text":"Best Katsuya I've ever had! Got an order of the chicken carbonara katsuya, a mix I've never had before but it was incredible. The portions are large so you might consider splitting a dish if you're not that hungry but for around $14, it's worth it if you can take
It home. My dinner partner and I shared the cheese crabmeat croquette which were much larger than we expected. I believe there were 5 in total but we couldn't finish that along with the chicken. 

The atmosphere was cool. It's a bit tiny but a lot of seating and the customer service was very friendly and attentive. At the end of your meal, you have to go up to the cashier to pay which we didn't realize at first but this is fine.

I'm not local to Toronto but I absolutely would come back if I visit again. If I could've taken leftovers, I would've. I'm still thinking of this place days later!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was great. I would recommend this place to anyone. They also have great happy hour from 5-7pm- pretty sure it's only on the weekdays but I could be wrong."}
{"text":"A wide variety of katsu for all kinds of taste buds. Be prepared for large portions, and inner battle of \"Should I take some home? Or finish it all now?!\" 

I came here with a friend on a Tuesday night, and they were pretty busy. I tried the spicy garlic katsu, and let me tell you... it's not a lie. The right amount of kick, with an intense hit of fried garlic. As someone who loves garlic, this may have been a bit much for me. So fair warning!
My friend had the original, and she said it was good. The katsu comes with a side of rice (not overloaded), and shredded cabbage. Everything balances out quite nicely, without being too greasy. 

The service was friendly, and pretty fast. For a restaurant in the Ryerson area, they seem to be prepared for quick turn around and lunch/dinner rushes. 

NOTE: No LLBO yet - as of October 10th."}
{"text":"HH nightly from 5-7.

Watermelon cucumber mojito $7 - get it 

double hamachi roll $11 - pretty good

Gyoza $14 - pretty and good. A little on the greasy side though. (No HH)"}
{"text":"Katsuya offers a variety of creative Japanese and asian fusion dishes to compliment a traditional high quality sushi bar. While perfect sushi all shares the same technique rolling technique and rice quality, Katsuya has managed to differentiate itself by adding unique flavors and cooking methods to some of the roll toppings and fillings. 

The corn crunch roll is a particular favorite. The lobster roll is also delicious however I feel it is much better after having sat in a refrigerator to cool as the warm lobster and California roll combo takes on a mushy texture that's hard to hold together as well as a certain muted flavor that seems to be unlocked through the chilling of the roll."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food. The wagyu fried rice was my favorite, but the sushi was amazing as well, pretty sure you can't really go wrong with anything"}
{"text":"LOVED the food here! Everything was delish, from the fried chicken to the crispy rice and tuna. Really great servers as well. Very impressive."}
{"text":"Social hour is the best time to be here!
My first time in & I was not disappointed. The ambience was nice & so were the staff. 
The social hour menu wasn't huge, but included a lot of great items for a great price. 
I got the Kiwi Envy cocktail & it was so refreshing! Not overly sweet or too strong. 
I also order the creamy rock shrimp, karaage japanese fried chicken & baked crab hand roll. 
All of it was delicious! The fried chicken was perfectly seasoned & juicy + the sauce on the side was yummy. The baked crab roll was my favorite. It tasted fresh & it was full of flavor. 
This is def one of new favorite spots!"}
{"text":"This is THE best Japanese restaurant in LV. I am Japanese and have had great Japanese food but that is far greater than I've ever had before. Chef Josh is the best chef there and his creations are so beautiful and tastes out of this world. Try the wagyu fried rice. .it's to die for! The uni is one of the best I've ever tasted.. so fresh and clean.  Try the mushroom hot pot is also very tasty.  The sushi platter is impressive but also there is caviar on the salmon sushi and it gives it a outburst of flavors when you bite into it.  The service is also outstanding...they're always there when you run out of drinks and right when you're ready for your next course, and of course it's always with a smile.  Even the happy hour menu is a good variety and good quality, so make sure that you come to the place whenever you have even a short amount of time...you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We heard of a discount for locals at all SLS restaurants until just before Christmas; 50% off if you have a local id and a membership to the SLS players club. We researched and decided to try Katsuya."}
{"text":"I've just recently been converted to a fan sashimi and Katsuya is one of my favorite spots. The service is superb, the staff is super friendly, and the food is amazing. The rock shrimp appetizers are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love the newly updated menu! If you like unique sauce pairings with your katsu then try this place out! I had the carbonara cheese katsu and I loved the sauce, it was well made and even had bits of broccoli and little shrimps in them. This is better than crazydon that's for sure. 

Rice and cabbage is still refillable, and you get miso soup in the beginning of your meal.

One star off for no AC :(, but luckily the fan was next to me :)."}
{"text":"I have alwys loved Katsuya, but I must say coming to this one has been so great! Jesus Sanchez is great-- thank you for alwys taking cAre of me and my guest. I definitely recommend this place!!! And the Brussels sprouts plate is to die for :)"}
{"text":"Takoyaki isn't made like typical style takoyaki, balls are crusted with katsu outer shell. The pork loin katsu is a good size and the sauce us good. Overall 4/5. Only downside was the cabbage side given, not much flavour in it."}
{"text":"First, let me get this off my chest.  Our server reminded me of Peppermint Patty from Charlie Brown.  Sorry.   All in all, our dining experience was impressive, but not unforgettable.  The Brussels sprouts were phenomenal. The quality of the fish was better than Morimoto but not quite Nobu quality.  The fried rice was tasty but I've had better concoctions when I lived in Vietnam and Korea.  The stand outs here are the cocktails and the service."}
{"text":"Service was great. Cool looking restaurant. We had the rock shrimp which was amazing. Definitely get again. We also ordered the ahi with crispy rice which was not good for a dish they said they are known for.  The ahi was very mushy and no flavor. The best thing there was a corn shrimp roll."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed this quiet oasis in amongst the kaching, Fresh ingredients make the finest sushi, and they make the best for a long ways, The service is so sweet, really thoughtful and entertaining, I'm sure to wei big tonight! My favorite is the spider roll!"}
{"text":"Great selection of fish great service, great ambiance. Matt our server was very knowledgeable of the menu/ drinks and made my 21st special recommend and comped a Sake for me made my birthday  special. Will be back in the future would recommend for all sushi lovers."}
{"text":"I had the curry karaage and the original Pork tonkatsu.  The curry karaage is really good.  The pork tonkatsu is also very good and it is a large piece of pork.  The staff is really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Pretty good tonkatsu, portions are very big and service was good. Although I found the fried oysters to be really oily. The place is pretty small but I would come back again."}
{"text":"Heard this place was amazing so I had to try it out myself. Usually when I go with high expectations, it always disappoints. However, Katsuya did not at all. We ordered the wagyu with foie gras, scallop sashimi, wagyu sashimi, wagyu fried rice, yellowtail with jalapeño, rock shrimp. Everything was perfect and it melted in your mouth, that's how fresh it was. Especially the wagyu fried rice is a must try. After eating that, the wagyu taste will linger in your mouth wanting more."}
{"text":"Amazing tasting food and probably the best katsu place in Toronto. Service is great and enviroment is cozy. I normally eat a lot but even the portions here I could'nt manage to finish. Katsuya may be a bit pricey but is worth it for sure. I recommend to come here with friends or on date."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner! The sushi was so fresh. Probably the freshest yellowtail sashimi I have had in years.

They have some signature drinks to test out. The Katsuya fresh which is a cucumber refreshing treat. Barely sweet but amazing!

The tempura as an appetizer was delicate and light. We had some wimpy California rolls with snow crab and they were also phenomenal. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Have been twice for Happy/Social Hour.  Will make it a point to eat and drink here every time in Vegas. All of the food I've ordered was better than good. Fried rice was impressive and the wagyu sliders melted in my mouth and made me instantly happy!  
The bartenders make great cocktails too!"}
{"text":"This cute hidden Japanese restaurant is along Yonge st (right after Steeles ave).

There's minimal parking spots in the lot, but room to park into the neighbourhood! 

They don't take reservations so first come first serve! I went on a Friday night around 7 which was perfect because right after there was a rush of people. The seats are wooden stools, with a combination of high top and low top tables. I really liked the overall ambiance of the restaurant because it felt very authentic and the staff always greets you when you walk in!!

As for the food...
Come here with an appetite!!! The portions are large. 

The prices vary between pork and chicken, oh and if you want cheese in it! I got the pork tender Terri Mayo Pork Tender Katsu w/o cheese and shared an appetizer of Crab Croquettes as everyone recommends.

Crab croquette (4/5): Large portions, really taste the crab, stuffed with cheesed, not too crunchy - very flavourful! 

Terri Mayo Pork Tender Katsu (4/5): You definitely get your required protein servings for the day with this one. Lots of flavour, Pork Tender crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The sauce drizzled on top complements the texture. (You can ask for extra sauce on the side). The salad that came with it was different, not too sure how to explain it but it was white and yummy.. 
pretty good overall! If I were to come back I may try something with stuffed cheese!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the SLS for a Bachelorette party and decided to dine at Katsuya for a last minute dinner meal. The sushi was fresh and the appetizers were good. My girlfriends weren't as happy with their meal and left most of it untouched. It was pricey without the ambience justification, but it's Vegas so that's that. Will be back if we stay at the SLS again."}
{"text":"Stayed at SLS Las Vegas in June and July of 2017. Katsuya was by far my favorite restaurant in the hotel! The happy hour menu is awesome and the pricing is extremely reasonable. When I returned in July, the manager sent over a round of premium shots for ALL 12 of us. Absolutely recommend this sushi spot to anyone traveling to LV- get the Crispy Rice Spicy Tuna... you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"I was a bit worried at how deserted SLS looked when I stopped by on a weekday evening - and became even more worried when I found Katsuya, just off the casino floor, looking just as empty. Then again, I was coming right at the beginning of happy hour, and, reassuringly, the restaurant began to fill with patrons.

Here, they call it \"social hour,\" and there are discounted drinks and small bites. I stuck with several craft beers as well as an assortment of bites. The yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and the spicy albacore sashimi with crispy onion didn't disappoint, and perhaps the real highlight of the meal was the baked crab hand rolls.

Service was also professional too - there was an Asian-American waitress whose name I can't remember but was really sharp and on top of things. Definitely a happy hour worth seeking out in an area just a bit north of the main action on the Strip."}
{"text":"Small cozy restaurant, but well staffed. Parking are limited on the premise. Katsu was well executed w/ great flavours (spiced). Excellent service made the night even better! Will defiantly repeat."}
{"text":"I ran into this place by coincidence, and \"wow\" I simply love it!!! Definitely coming back for more..."}
{"text":"After a long day of traveling from WV to Las Vegas, we got into Katsuya at the SLS around 9:45pm. Being that I am living in a mountain town in the middle of nowhere at the moment, lol, getting good Japanese is not very likely to say the least. So I was looking forward to having some great cuisine.

Katsuya is a very open space, with a large bar in the middle and the casino of the SLS is in plain view. Even that being the case, by the time we got there it was fairly vacant and not at all noisy. We were seated right away, ordered promptly, and within a few minutes our plates started to come in at a good pace

We started with some pan fried pork dumplings, and crispy cauliflower. Both of these were fantastic. Then followed our main course, which was the Fried Rice with A5 Wagyu, the Wagyu Ribeye, and a Sunset roll. Now a lot of places like to advertise wagyu steak, but don't really taste any different then a prime steak. So here I would say is the first time I tried what I imagine is an authentic wagyu steak. 

The ribeye just melted in your mouth and was cut into pieces with a spoon, almost like steak jello but with just enough bite to still eat like steak. That might not be an appetizing way of describing steak, but I can assure you it was delicious. It also came with grilled onion rings that were a nice touch.

The fried rice was excellent, and the wagyu steak that came with it was equally delicious but with a different texture than the ribeye. It was cut into cubes with a seared outside but soft middle. Really good stuff!

The Sunset roll was also great. I am not a big sushi guy myself (my girlfriend is), but I enjoyed it thoroughly. Dessert was delicious, and overall just a great meal. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is a really great spot. The social hour menu is incredible. The sushi is so fresh, great service and great prices from 5:30-7:30. This is one of our favorite sushi spots. We enjoy the spicy edamame, Sahara roll, and the rainbow roll. Jose is very nice and always helpful!"}
{"text":"This was an overall great experience. The service was top notch, they paid very close attention to when we finished each course and the next was whisked in front of us immediately. A friend in from out of town and each had the chef's tasting menu, I think the price was around $75. 

The rock shrimp and spicy tuna over crispy rice were great. The marinated black cod was simply perfection - melts in your mouth and has this rich velvety texture that was great."}
{"text":"Great food and generous katsu portion. It is on the pricier side though, my meal came up to a little over $20 after tax and tips for just ordering curry chicken katsu. Overall would recommend for the variety of katsu choice, quality, and service."}
{"text":"Katsuya, like the name suggests, primarily serves different types of katsu (breaded deep fried meat cutlets).

I was most impressed with the size of the meal. While manageable for one, it is guaranteed to leave you stuffed! I ordered the chicken katsu curry here. While I enjoyed the overal taste, I felt like the batter did not hold its own when mixed with curry, as the skin would lose its crunch and would fall apart from the meat when I try to pick up a piece

My first experience here was pleasant, but not outstanding. I would pick Kaijiu over this if it remained open, but perhaps I'll drop by again if I'm feeling a katsu meal."}
{"text":"A little pricey for average sushi, but it is Vegas.  But the happy hour is awesome, my friends ordered off the hour hour menu and my daughter and I ordered standard Vegan rolls.  We got the vegi roll that was really good as well and a cucumber roll, and the avocado roll,  all were really good, we also ordered soy beans.  Oh warning we ordered something that was a pickled plum roll,  that was one of the worst things I have eaten in a long time just don't do it.

The service was ok, I have mixed feelings, basically here it is.  In order to enjoy the happy hour you must be in the bar section.  So we request the bar and the rest of the place was empty but the bar was at capacity. The hostess takes us to the actual bar and Byutercup asks me if it ok to sit there as the bartender is asking how old she is.  oops not 21 so not sitting at the sushi bar we go back to the hostess, my friend is about to throw a fit (totally not necessary)  anyway a couple tell me they are getting ready to leave and we can have their table.  I love people.  So we go back to the hostess station I let her know what the couple had said and let her do her job.  She took the information that I gave her and she seats us at a table that is marked reserved to make sure that we are seated.  The other table was cleared by the time the people with the reservation arrived; everybody wins.  The service was a little slow and It was annoying that our friends had received all 3 of their rolls before we even got our soy beans.  The server can only bring out what the chef's give her.  

The location was convenient in the hotel that we stayed in SLS.  When I go back to Vegas I don't see myself eating there again."}
{"text":"Superb entrees- the cod and striped bass are particularly recommended. The salmon was also very good. 

Solidly good sushi - the unagi was good if not great- Not quite as fresh and authentic as you may expect.

Subpar service - hurried, harried, impersonal : minus 1 star."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! You may take a look at the menu and think that it's a tad pricey as I did, but don't be fooled - you get A LOT of deep fried porky goodness for what you pay! I've tried almost all of their sauces, and I'm torn between the original... and everything else. The best way to go about it is to go with a bunch of other (non germaphobic) people and just dip your pork into their plates. I recommend the pork tender, but several of my friends can't tell the different between the loin (cheapest and bigger) and the tender. I've also tried some of their appetizers, which are good but I don't remember what they were because THE KATSU. BASICALLY WHAT I AM SAYING IS if you like katsu please come here and get almost anything and you will be happy. Unless you're from Japan, in which case you'll at least be content. Kthxbye."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The consistency in the food is a huge reason why I keep going back.  The service is good.  The staff is incredibly friendly.  The fish is always fresh.  The crispy rice with spicy tuna is one of my favorites.  The marinated miso cod is a must try.  My boyfriend hates veggies and even he loves the crispy brussel sprout leaves with balsamic soy reduction, sliced almonds and bonito flakes.  All of the cocktails are so well balanced.  My favorite is the katsuya fresh with vodka, rock sake, and fresh cucumber and lime.  For anyone who is a seafood fan Kastsuya is a must try.  You don't need to enjoy sushi or raw because there are so so many other options.  Came here recently with some family members and they absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"Love the food here.  Come here very often,  always great! Chicken and pork tender are the best!!"}
{"text":"Jose was my server , profesional, kind and sweet and knows his menus so well. He recommended the Chicken salad , WOW and for my second plate I had the Noodles with Sea food . That was a magical plate ! I will go back really soon.
Thanks Jose I love the food , how clean this place always is and love the way you served me... you rock Jose thanks"}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for the longest time. Hopped in with a friend right before closing on a Sunday night and it was still busy. No waiting but the resto was still packed. Ordered the pork loin katsu with curry and boy was it a treat. Very, very generous portion of deep fried deliciousness. Staff was friendly, attentive, and eye candy. =P  

Great vibes overall.
BTW, I almost regret not going sooner."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed katsuya and their Tonkatsu. Both the pork and the chicken option were soft and light and not overpowered by the crispy batter. Their sauces were flavourful and each had its own unique taste.

The curry was reminiscent of those in Japan (although still can't compare, its decent if we compare it to other Japanese places that serves curry in the GTA). Paired well with the Katsu for sure. Got the pork tenderloin so that might've given it a kick as it's the more expensive option of out the other parts of the pig.

The carbonara was tasty as well. A little heavy with the cream but they also added Chili flakes to give it a kick. Different experience but a nice one.

Their takoyaki was different and their wings weren't the best. Both used their Katsu batter which took away the authenticity of the actual dish. Wings were also hard.

Overall great flavours, crispy and light tonkatsu. Would come again for the Katsu no doubt."}

{"text":"The katsu is good, way better than Mr.Tonkatsu in my opinion. Came on Sunday night, surprised to find there's no line up. Service was fast and on point. Ordered the original, katsu pork loin, chewy and the sauce is a good match with the meat. Heard u can get free refill on rice, but didn't opt for that. Overall experience was good. Beer on menu but not available yet, guess they haven't got the licence yet. Will come back to try other items on menu."}
{"text":"WOOO DOGGIES! I don't normally eat meat anymore, but holyy, this place makes me want to again.  

(Food:)
CARBONARA CHEESE KATSU is soo good!  They somehow put a layer of cheese in between the pork and the breaded/deep fried part, and then coated the whole thing in a seafood creamy carbonara sauce.  Honestly the portions that they give here are amazinggg.  The cut of pork is larger than my fist.  They definitely do not skimp here.  Added to the side is also a touch of raw cabbage, just to keep the dish a bit more balanced.  

(Price:)
CARBONARA CHEESE KATSU: $19.75

(Ambience:)
I like the feel of this place, it's rustic and cozy.

(Service:)
Great!

(Comparable:)
There's no real comparable place!  The best in Toronto for Katsu by far!

(Overall:)
Great portions, great tasting!  You do leave feeling quite heavy, but what can you expect from pork wrapped in cheese, breaded and then deep-fried?"}
{"text":"Amazing! Prices are awesome the food is fresh & delicious. The drinks are great. Perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"I have nothing but more good things to say about katsuya.
Every so often, they do a 50% off for locals night- which is like a gift from God. But EVERYDAY there is now a happy hour which offers a limited menu- but all amazing things, at REALLY good prices.
The food here is AMAZING and the service is beyond. They bend over backwards here to make sure you are happy.
Their new manager came to my table and introduced herself to me because she was told that I am a regular, and sent us out some of the most amazing treats. It was so sweet and very appreciated!.
I wanna hug you so hard, katsuya!"}
{"text":"Definitely a 4.5/5 for this place. 

The katsu pieces are HUGE and rice/miso/salad is endless. It's a pretty smallish place, that can get packed pretty easily. The waiters are very attentive and they have excellent service. I got the Terri-mayo katsu (same toppings as takoyaki - mayo, bbq sauce, bonito flakes, and seaweed) - it was really good, I didn't feel extremely heavy afterwards. I guess my only gripe was that there was too much mayo for me at the time, which kind left the middle of the katsu slightly soggy - however, STILL DELICIOUS and I would go back. Prices are between $12-16, which is pretty fair for Toronto and the amount that you get. 

I would definitely recommend the takoyaki - it's soft and crunchy on the outside, unlike some Japanese places! They use the same panko crumbs, I'm assuming, for the outside batter and it leaves it crunchy on the outside, and not too piping hot on the inside."}
{"text":"Read reviews 
Had to try
I agreed 
Affordable, tasty and great service 
Had the sweet chilli 
Great job"}
{"text":"I was expecting something different I guess as I have been in Japan and I remember enjoying this restaurant there. Not a big fan of seafood, so I think this was my mistake. Staff very friendly, though."}
{"text":"All you can eat salad , soup. Pork is good. I order the one with cheese. $17 is so worth it. It is my go to pork place"}
{"text":"I decided to stop in to Katsuya for social hour (happy hour). Great deals, great service and nice decor. I had a few questions about the drinks and the bartender helped sell me on one of the options by allowing me to sample it before ordering. Next I had a seaweed salad and a roll. Both were delicious and during happy hour, the price is definitely right. Overall, great experience and I definitely recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"Continuing to frequent this place because of the great service and quality food. I love the vibes too! Favourite place to eat in the neighbourhood, hands down."}
{"text":"One of the best donkatsu I've ever had. Service is friendly and fast. Small menu, but delicious food"}
{"text":"So delicious! We got the original chicken and the sweet chili and both were phenomenal. So light and crispy. They make their own bread fresh for their Japanese Pablo breadcrumbs. So impressed."}
{"text":"Really great cocktails and friendly bartender.
Burning Mandarin - my favorite of the 3 that i tried that night
Fallen Angel
Samurai
I truly thought all 3 cocktails were very well balanced and pretty refreshing.  I couldn't stop licking the rim of my glass of the Burning mandarin.  It tasted like it was rimmed with tang!"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but so tasty! I got the white snow chili pork tender. The pork tender was cooked very well! Crispy on the outside, not too dry on the inside. I also feel like the service was really good. The waitress was friendly and personable, and they also offered us free bottomless miso soup due to the cold weather!"}
{"text":"Yes, just yes. I want to come back to Katsuya again because it is great!

I usually come into these Asian-fusion restaurants like Katsuya with some doubt in mind because they have failed to impress me. With a SLS $75 F&B credit to my name, I was intrigued to try Katsuya with my dad because of the high rating on Yelp. 

My pops and I went with the following choices:
the summer 3-course dinner
Corn crunch roll
Lobster Tempura

Corn Crunch Roll (4/5): Garlic-butter sauteed shrimp and avocado, accompanied by corn tempura on top. Absolutely a must-get for people who don't like raw fish sushi rolls. This was full of flavor and a nice of change of pace from the typical shrimp tempura roll at most places. 

Lobster Tempura (4/5): Amazing, lightly battered with a mild-spicy sauce. Lots of meat within the 1/2 lobster.

Summer 3-course dinner (5/5): Easily the best part of the dinner. Choose the mushroom salad as starter, seafood yakisoba noodles as main entree and chocolate cake with tapioca for dessert. I LOVED the mushroom salad and seafood yakisoba noodles. There were many varieties of oriental fresh mushrooms inside the salad, they complemented the greens very well.  Seafood yakisoba noodles consisted  an abundance of shrimp, calamari, scallops and lobster and was seasoned to perfection. 

Service was probably the only negative highlight of the dinner experience. They brought another table's food to us two separate times and were slow to refilling water glasses. Aside from that, I was happy with the food at Katsuya and I can't wait to be back again!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was pretty modern Japanese design, it has very open dining floor where you can see basically the whole restaurant no more where you are sitting.

The Brussels sprouts and ceviche were the dishes I remembered most. The mushroom salad also good, but the butter lettuce needed to be cut into smaller pieces.  Whole lettuce leaf and chopstick for a salad makes it difficult to eat.  

The serve was average, even though they were on top of things.  The server had to inquire with another person about at least three items on the menu. 

We ordered numerous amount of drinks: watermelon mojito, kiwi envy, espresso martini, hot sake, jasmine margarita & two IPAs.   If I were to ask which drink had the highest price point, which one would you chose?  

Answer... 12oz IPA = $22 (I ordered two not knowing totaling $44).  I'm a pretty avid drinker if IPA and was also a GM at a bar, so I feel I have a good understand of the average price of IPAs.  But $22 for one beer ... Is more than I would even consider to call pricey.

Would definitely go eat there again but I will start asking for the cost of each alcoholic beverage I order."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere and food was very good. Steak and foie gras was amazing, also the tuna with crispy rice was special. Enjoyed the samurai drink, we tasty.

Service was very attentive, only let down was no fried chicken. 

Price was a bit high."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here this Tuesday night at about 7 p.m. it was busy they sat us right away. Everything we got was excellent we got the cucumber salad miso soup the corn sushi California roll and the rainbow one and it was all excellent the corn one is a must!!!!! It's a really good-looking Place service was good..food outstanding will go back!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi I ever had. Come during their 'social hour' which I believe is 4pm-7pm or so. The prices that time are incredible: $9 for specialty rolls that are normally $22 any other time of the night! A real value during this happy hour time. All the rolls I ordered were delicious and I highly recommend Katsuya whether going with friends, family or a date; the food is impressive."}
{"text":"Best of the best....easy to write this, service, food, and management is first rate. 
The food. So fresh. If you are into Japanese food you can tell fresh, that is what you get here. 

A must is spicy tuna on crispy rice.  Wooo it is so good. Also a must, the yellow tail, the freshness is as good as the presentation . Cut thin and rolled up with small jalapeno slice on top...a 10. 

The manager Jesus, cares about your experience here. Many on his position are hidden away in an office, not Jesus.  

The service, as good as the food. Great to have a server who knows the food and the Saki...real good to. 

Yes a bit pricey but here you get what you pay for, a great dinning experience. 

Don't pass this up. 

Thanks to you all."}
{"text":"This is the second time I was able to eat at SLS's Katsuya. The decor, designed by Phillipe Starcke is just amazing and provides a great framing of the delicacies arriving to the table.
The reason its not a 5 star review is because the 2 times I was there a weeknight and Saturday early evening dinner they were \"out\" of uni. 

That killed me, since I love it so and in a gunkan, mmmm. But I was able to recover and eat a lot of other great seafood. This past trip was for my parents' 53rd anniversary. We ordered the omakase geta. Their largest sushi platter. All the fishes were awesome, the rolls were great and I really liked the play on their crunchy rice spicy tuna. Being 1/2 Puerto Rican, it make me think of pegao with fish. Great mouth feel and contrast on texture.

Service was overall great, manager sent out a cool ice cream with crunchy honey comb. Very yummy, indeed. 

Just get some uni in and this local will be back for a lot more!"}
{"text":"Great quick bite in the GTA. Portions are huge for lunch, be sure to go on an empty stomach or go for dinner. There is no specific \"lunch\" menu so the portion and price is the same for dinner. I tried the carbonara pork tender which I loved. Would recommend that dish. The carbonara complemented the dish well with a hint of spice.

Tip: free pop when you check in yelp!"}
{"text":"I was beyond impressed with this location. I was expecting it just to be pretty good. I typically eat and stay at higher end locations in Vegas. I can't say enough how good it was. This was on a pretty dead Sunday night for Vegas also. I usually don't stay that far north of the strip, but I'd journey to Katsuya anytime for some great Sushi!"}
{"text":"This is not the original store I want to go to but I don't think it matters since it is the same restaurant. After reading all these reviews, I believe most of them are fake or maybe they just want to get that 5 dollars coupon after they write the review. Unfortunately, many of these reviews is not what I experienced during my visit. 

This is a new location inside downtown Toronto very close to the university. Outside there was a flyer that said 100 best restaurants in Canada. I guess it might be. When I walk up, I saw two doors. The one that you have to walk up the stair is the real entrance. Everything inside were tidy and clean with enough space between each table that made me feel very comfortable. We sat down at a table with four chairs and the waitress came over with the menus. 

The menus has many pages but pretty much everything is the same except for the different varies of the sauce. The waitress gave us a compliment soup right after we ordered. There was not much selection of appetizers so we got the classic takoyaki which was decent. The texture is too mushy but the flavor is good. For the meal, I got the pork loin katsu with the carbonara sauce(seafood white sauce) that cost $14 CAD. It came out in a huge shell shape plate with rice and salad and a huge pork katsu. When I tasted, it was crispy but after two minutes, it became soggy because of the sauce on the top. The katsu was oily in my mouth that I don't like at all. I recommended asking the waiter or the waitress to put the sauce on the side to keep the outside crispy and used it as a dipping sauce. With the size of the food, it is definitely sharable meal. 

The service was great but the food was decent. Without the services I would give this 2 stars. It was a nice experience but not memorable. If you are at Toronto then why not try it."}
{"text":"Mmm, the Katsu here certainly lived up to my expectations after reading all of its highly rated reviews! The menu is simple yet holds a lot of variety and the Katsu is super crispy, flavourful, and delicious. 

Must get: Curry or Carbonara flavoured Katsu. I opted for the cheapest option out of all the meats (pork loin) which was still really good, and the unique sauces definitely topped the dish off. In fact, the Carbonara even makes your Katsu taste like pasta - it was great. Don't forget to take advantage of the unlimited refills of miso soup, cabbage, and rice with your meal! 

The inside of the restaurant is quite small and casual, and the service was pretty good. I would come back."}
{"text":"Cons: 1) miso soup was too salty; 2) regular salmon was too big, I could put it in a mouth.

Pros: 1) beautiful design and decoration; 2) nice stuff"}
{"text":"Katsu-bla....what makes the LA version good is the scene...when you take the scene away and expose the mediocre food and double the price, it makes for a disappointing experience.  I have to say the service is great...but the food was just not good...nothing was balanced or seasoned correctly and the fish was below average. Dropped $380 on 2 people so we sample quite a lot...but not nearly as much as you would expect for that price and a thoroughly disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Hmmm this place is kind of average in taste for me. I ordered the original cheese katsu and my bf ordered the garlic Chili sauce katsu without cheese. In terms of the sauce, it was slightly sweet and not much of a kick or depth to it. The katsu was huge which is good but the meat was bland even with sauce. The garlic Chili sauce that I tried from my bf's plate was definitely better, had more of a kick and if you order this , order the sauce on the side unless you like soggy meat. The meal is definitely filling if you come hungry but I don't see the hype about this place. If you are planning to drive here, good luck with that since there are only three small parking spaces. I had to park across the street at the timmies cause their place was full"}
{"text":"It's a great restaurant. Small and intimate, is usually busy at night time but is worth the wait. The food is portioned well. It does come with soup, salad and rice. There are refills for the side dishes with katsu combos."}
{"text":"This place was really,  really good!!  I came here for a chill Friday night dinner with D and a friend tonight.  This location is their downtown location and it is not very big.  But the seating is not crammed in anyways.  In fact,  it is decorated in a cross between industrial and urban chic.  I felt it was nice,  comfortable,  and at the same time I wasn't crampt.  
The servers were all very nice and friendly.  The food was delicious!  Their menu is not huge but still plenty of choices to pick from.  We ordered a fee dishes to share.  The portions are big.  We ordered curry chicken karaga,  deep fried oysters,  a chicken katsu dish and the pork tender carbonara katsu.  Their wasbi mayo sauce is my favorite.  It is so GOOD.  For the prices that they charge,  I think this place definitely give you quality and quantity.  I am so coming back and next time I am going to try the croquettes!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, Excellent Service

I would definitely go back here again.  However, given all the availability of the sushi restaurants in Vegas, I would probably go with Japaneiro first since it is a local restaurant, and then I would consider either going to Katsuya or Sushi Roku if I wanted to eat on the strip.  If I just wanted sushi, I would go to SoHo or Yama Sushi."}
{"text":"My favorite Katsuya location so far! This restaurant has a very nice layout, the dining area in the back is very romantic and intimate, with booth or half booth seatings. At first we were seated at a very uncomfortable table with hard chairs right in the middle of all seatings in the sushi bar dining area, it was unacceptable cause we never sit at hard chairs whenever we dine at Katsuya! I guess it was section manager saw us looking around, asked if we needed anything, we complained, she moved us to a big booth for four in the back corner of the dining area, it was so private and intimate, that's more like it for our favorite sushi dinner date!

We have tried pretty much all the items on the menu in LA, Just when we couldn't decide what to have again this time, we saw Omakase?!!! That's awesome, we LOVE Omakase! I love to see what beautiful creations chef has to offer! Omakase it is! I ordered a refreshing vodka specialty cocktail, hubby had our favorite sake Kikusui, they were light and tasty drinks that are perfect for sushi and sashmi.

When our Omakase came, it was WOW!!! It looked so beautiful, spectacular presentation, with assorted sashimi, nigiri sushi, signature rolls and hand rolls. It also came with signature apps like the new chawanmushi, it's steamed eggs with lobster in mini size, marinated raw octopus cucumber salad, and my favorite spicy tuna on crispy rice. It was a lot of food for two people! I think it could easily feed up to four people! 

Everything was so fresh, probably the freshest among the fresh! We took time to sip on drinks and enjoy this amazing Omakase, it was so romantic and lovely! Our server was extremely friendly and attentive, all the staffs and section managers were very professional, checked up on us now and then, great job! 

I plan to eat here every time we are in Vegas, they open till late on Fridays and Saturdays, this is the only fine dining restaurant that opens till late at SLS. 

Again Katsuya?! You are the BEST! 

Ps. Our server gave us free LIFE nightclub pass, not that we needed it but it was nice of him.
Starck likes to design all whites with popped out colors, it's so beautiful, but can he just let go of the hard chairs, why some of the dining people deserve to sit on uncomfortable hard chairs eating at the same restaurant? It's not fair!"}
{"text":"Third time wasn't a charm at Katsuya! Our two previous times at this restaurant (for the summer tasting menu & my birthday) were both truly spectacular! Awesome service, drinks, & totally unforgettable dining experiences!

This time, however, not so much...This time, server just seemed to be \"phoning it in...\" No recommendations from the menu (which is always a nice touch) and just a pretty \"meh\" vibe in general. The food was still oh so tasty (but truly overpriced w/out the tasting menu or my cool SLS birthday discount)...

Will we return? Maybe, if there's a cool deal or special--but my most recent experience really was disappointing."}
{"text":"Great Sushi! Open late. Friendly service. The Baja Crispy Roll was amazing! And amazing cheese cake in a sushi restaurant. Who would have guessed?"}
{"text":"Tried it for lunch for the first time today and was impressed with the quality of the food. As the name suggests, the main dish is Katsu - nearly every variety of it! Cheese Katsu? Yep :) Oh, how CRISPY it was, just a pleasure to crunch through. And super-tender on the inside! I went for the original tender. Simple, delicious, filling, perfect. Excellent ambiance, super-friendly service. It does get a bit busy though, plan an hour to enjoy for lunch. The Takoyaki was superb as well. Probably the best I've tried. I almost dozed off multiple times at my meeting after. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Dining options are fairly limited inside the SLS. You have an expensive steak house; so does every other hotel casino.  You have a sub-par burger joint relying upon LA hype...yawn.  Don't forget the pizza place that has already been in Vegas at the Monte Carlo and nobody took notice until it was at the SLS.  Buffet?  Closed.

Moving on, you have Katsuya; my favorite place to dine at this property. Service has been excellent every time I've been here; the wait staff knows the menu inside and out and also knows what to recommend to the folks who may not be interested in roe, squid or other \"interesting\" items. On a few occasions the GM stopped by the table to check in; nice touch. 

The 5 items that I've had repeatedly are my favorites:  Yellowtail jalapeño, Special Katsuya roll, Lobster roll, Corn crunch roll and the Wagyu fried rice.  For 38 dollars the A4 grade beef in the fried rice is simply amazing; enough for two to share."}
{"text":"So so so very good. 8 of us here for a Galantines Day weekend and... Y.U.M. 

Dustin was our server and we adored him. We let him know we had a show to see and that we were on a bit of a schedule and he let us know \"if we were in it to win it then he was too.\" He let us excitedly shout or our order to him... And made some stellar recommendations. Everything came out so fast and SO DELICIOUS. I'm pretty sure I didn't breathe while I ate. My fave was the Brussels sprouts. 

We wound up with extra time so he suggested that he'd pick some desserts for us and we couldn't have been more grateful. Enough decisions already! EVERYTHING was exquisite.

Anyway. We loved it. Hard to say what was better... The food or the service. Thank you to Dustin and thank you to the management and thank you to the super talented chefs!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! I always love katsuya and the Vegas location is just as good as the la spots. Dustin and Emily were our servers- really knowledgable and super friendly. Fun dinner!"}
{"text":"After a name change of what used to be Mr Tonkatsu, Katsuya provides a hip and fantastic Japanese cuisine option in North York, comparable to what one would find in downtown Toronto. 

The decor and furniture give a rustic first impression of Asian  authenticity. It's not difficult to find prints of Sakura on pieces of woods that decorates the wall of the restaurant. 

The presentation of the food is very appetizing and the portions are very generous. Free refills of rice, salad and miso soup are included with an order of a set meal. Meat options include pork loin, pork tender, chicken, cod, all prepared in tasty cutlets. What makes Katsuya's tonkatsu unique and refreshing is that one can choose various sauce to go along with their meal, such as carbonara, sweet chili, spicy and garlic. 

Dining at Katsuya is an overall very satisfying and pleasant experience, enhanced by various opportunities to get a free beverage or discount through their promotional incentives."}
{"text":"Ate here for our wedding dinner!!! The server, Julie, was on point with her recommendations!!! Best sushi I've ever eaten.... truly! Management checked on us and provided complimentary champagne which was soooo perfect!!! Ty Katsuya for helping make our special evening ballin!!!!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with my experience at Katsuya.  A lot of friends and family have raved about it being one of the better sushi spots around so I anticipated going there for a while.  

I finally went last night with a party of 11. The ambience is great.  It's located in the middle of the SLS, straight in front of the doors when you walk in.  The restaurant is well lit and has a fun dinner party vibe. 

Unfortunately, the service my table got was terrible.  It took 25 minutes for the waitress to introduce herself to the table and ask for drinks and literally another 45 minute for them to be delivered and order food.

I ordered two sushi rolls and two pieces of sashimi.  The takenuri roll was basically a spicy tuna roll for 25 dollars and each piece of sashimi was 5 bucks.  My asahi was 15 dollars.  All orders of our food were just mediocre at best and it was quite pricey.  

I will definitely not return to Katsuya and prefer YAMA (all you can eat sushi about .5 miles off of the strip down flamingo) for 25 dollars and way higher quality sushi."}
{"text":"The sauce for the cheese tonkatsu is so amazing! Light and delicious, definitely a new place for tonkatsu for us. Plus the service is great and the pace clean and relaxed. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi, the atmosphere is amazing and their service is over the top. Their happy hour is pretty good as well with a decent selection of their best sushi rolls and appetizers.  A must to try whenever your in town. You would love It."}
{"text":"Very happy with the service here from my server, Mario. It takes a lot to be a great server and I would say he definitely has that skill. The food was also top notch. Lobster roll with dynamite sauce is mind blowing while the sunset roll with eel was lighter and easier to eat quickly (which shouldn't be done, savor). Drink wise the watermelon and cucumber mojito was light and refreshing with a little kick in the end. All in all this will be a repeat trip next time I am in this area."}
{"text":"Katsuya is amazing! Delicious flavor, friendly service, and incredibly fresh fish! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Our first time visiting SLS and being at this end of strip - found it to be a lot less chaotic. The restaurant was easy to find once you walk into lobby/casino area. It is on main level at back of casino floor. We shared several small plates and since we arrived 15 minutes before end of Happy Hour, they still allowed us to order at HP prices! Crispy rice tuna sashimi, tuna and crisp onions, fried chicken, corn tempura roll, gyoza... All nicely presented and delicious. Service was a little slow (bringing food and drinks out), but they were all very friendly and attentive. Everything at \"Vegas prices\" but walked out full and satisfied."}
{"text":"decent food and service but minus a star for not taking credit card...unacceptable in this day and age"}
{"text":"Had one of the best Tonkatsu (pork cutlet) ever here at Katsuya. Nice thick cut of lean and extremely tender pork with just the right amount of breading. Fried perfectly to a golden brown, leaving the inside super moist while the outside nice and crisp. They even have the tonkatsu resting on a rack to ensure it doesn't get soggy!

The chicken karage thighs were also delicious, served with 3 different sauces. The one drawback of this place is everything is deep-fried, except 2 dishes: a regular Japanese style udon and a creamy version of the udon. So if you are health-conscious and tagging along with your buddies that couldn't care less about their cholesterol level, your options will be limited. Would be nice if they had some salad options to balance out the meal. 

The servers here are extremely friendly and very attentive. The atmosphere is nice, although I find the seats here uncomfortable (hard chair with no cushion). Finally, the parking situation here is horrible! Very limited parking to begin with and most spots are reserved for the other shops. So if you come during prime hours, may have to park at a different mall and walk. 

If you have a tonkatsu craving, this is the place to go! If parking wasn't such a nightmare, I would be here more often."}
{"text":"Katsuya had great service and the portions were extremely big! There was a large selection of different sauces that accompanied the katsu and each one tasted pretty good. 

Overall, great experience and I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Don't come expecting good food or good service. Has that sake bomb restaurant feel. Not special at all."}
{"text":"I came because I heard all the hype about this place. I ended up only getting the cheesy crab croquettes. The rest of it I'm still trying to justify in my head. The prices aren't ridiculously overblown, but for what it is, is it really that great? I'm sure a part of this is the social aspect of it, but as I went alone, I was left rather unimpressed. I couldn't taste the crab in the croquette, although I could see small bits of it. I could feel some of the cheese, but I expected more of it, and more distinctly flavored. The croquettes were tasty overall, but for the price, I'm left wanting more."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, we stumbled upon it through YELP!  As always had a great tip.

It is a bit pricey here, but if you can make it for their happy hour, the food and drinks are almost half price.  My friend and I were able to try about 6 dishes, and have some nice beer and wine, for a great value.

The sushi here is high end, and the presentation is amazing.  You will definitely be impressed.  The lounge is also funky, matches the SLS hotel style, and it was a great spot to start the night.  We went for dinner, and jumped on the tram and hit the Cirque show after.

Happy Hour details are every Thursday through Monday from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. on June 11 at the bar. Find dishes for $4-$10, specialty cocktails for $7, hot sake, well drinks, house wine and draft Kirin for $6 each."}
{"text":"I can see why they are one of the top 100 Restaurants in the country. 

The food was delicious, and portions are generous. Service was quick. Ambiance fits everything perfectly. Topping it all off was a price that was so reasonable, I was amazed. 

Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Good service and food.   Not going to elaborate beyond this since I actually gave an extensive review for the other North York location.  No disappointment here!"}
{"text":"Very good place for many different types Japanese curry!   Not a very large place but turnover is fairly quick.   They actually have parking...kind of (3 spots) but when you consider most places at Yonge and Finch have none this is a bonus.   The place was very lively and service is very good.   The curry fish, pork etc have many different sauces (styles) that you can order.  We tried many different ones and frankly they were all good!  So close your eyes and pick one-no disappointments.   The portions were good as well.   Even though the meat was fried there was no hint of oil or the oil aftertaste (cooking with old oil).   Your chance to experience authentic Japanese cutlet without going to Japan!"}
{"text":"I'm not a tonkatsu connoisseur by any means but I know good food when I taste it and Katsuya is doing great things with their tonkatsu. I was skeptical about a Tonkatsu place receiving 4.5 stars on Yelp but after eating here, I can see what the fuss is about.

I went with the server's recommendation to try the Original Japanese pork tender Katsu since it was my first time eating there. My meal came with sauce on the side, sesame seeds with a pestle to grind the seeds, steamed rice, cabbage salad/slaw with a light dressing, as well as miso soup. 

Hubby ordered the spicy garlic pork katsu with cheese. The sauce on his meal had a real kick and lots of ooey gooey cheese. My brother in law got the Katsuya original with a delicious non-spicy sauce. It too was really good (I would get this next time). As if the meal wasn't of decent value already, they give you refills on soup and salad. But the real star of the meal truly is the katsu. The perfectly battered, non-greasy, light and crispy pieces of meat were really delicious! I would definitely come back here to eat.

Katsuya is located in the same plaza as Mr Meat, and parking is limited. One should consider parking on a nearby side street if the lot is full. Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Stayed at the SLS Las Vegas knowing that it had just changed ownerships however, the restaurants are still under SLS.  Katsuya was deffinately an amazing exoerience. The sushi chefs are deffinately talented as the presentation and cut of the Omakase Sashimi was impeccable as well as the chefs choices of fish.  Crispy rice with tuna obviously was amazing as always and the rock fish tempura roll was mouthwatering.  Deffinately a must do quality sushi of you are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is consistent and delicious. All the fried items never tasted like dirty reused oil. The sauce is bang on. I always come back for the carbonara. The dinning area is a bit small but I never had to wait too long."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant! & the amazing hospitality of the staff really made me feel welcome. By the way you have to try there Cucumber Sunomono Salad is to die for!"}
{"text":"Super random night, ended up at SLS and decided to try this place out. We were greeted by this young lady named Gia, loved her! We sat right up front at the sushi bar to get more of a faster service. Our waiter's name was Matt and he was so nice. 

Food:
Started off w/ Brussels sprouts, super crispy w/ a hint of a sweet taste to them.
Miso soup, tasted like any other miso soup.
Crispy rice, good portion of tuna on top.
Octopus, was served with a green sauce, can't remember what it was. 
Crispy glazed shrimp, yum very good. 
Sashimi yellow tail, delicious. 
And of course I had to have dessert.
We decided on their Bread Pudding and ohhhhh my gosh!!!
It was amazing, it came w/ a side of Hennessy to drizzle all over and it gave it such a distinct taste. The warm bread pudding paired w/ vanilla ice cream was amazing. 

Thank you Gia for recommending it to us, and Matt for providing excellent service."}
{"text":"Great Japanese fusion. Beat the dinner rush. Wait time was 5-7 minutes. Was served right away. Great food and beer selection. Servings are a good enough portion. Great for groups, and couples."}
{"text":"Yummy - the pork tender is super crispy and doesn't feel greasy at all

I especially love the curry pork tender with cheese and the spicy fish katsu

The portions are big though - if you want to try the different sauces - suggest ordering diff dishes and share amongst friends"}
{"text":"Very similar to an original Katsuya Experience  once I had in Tokyo. Very polite and lovely people and great food."}
{"text":"We decided to give them a try for dessert before trying them for dinner. The server told us there was not a dessert menu but they had yuzu cheesecake, green tea creme brûlée, chocolate lava cake, and yuzu sorbet. None of the desserts seemed inspired to me. Especially the chocolate lava cake which is outdated and the green tea creme brûlée which is commonly served at Japanese restaurants. 

None of the desserts were well executed. Instead of coming with yuzu cheesecake, the dessert sampler came with black sesame mochi because they ran out of the cheesecake. 

I am in no rush to return for dinner because if they cannot execute straight forward desserts I do not feel they can execute straight forward Japanese food."}
{"text":"Was in town for the CES tradeshow so luckily we had made reservations far in advance because the restaurant was packed. Even with a reservation for 7:30PM, we weren't seated until around 8:10PM which wasn't a great start to the night. The hostess who is the first point of contact for people as they arrive at the restaurant also didn't have a great attitude.

Apart from the rough first impression, once we were seated the evening started looking up. The same hostess with the bad attitude came up to us and apologized for the long wait and gave us free champagne! Yay, all is forgiven. The servers were friendly and helpful and offered many menu suggestions to us. We ordered the spicy tuna crispy rice, mushroom bop & corn crunch roll to share between two people. The food all had really good flavour and I definitely enjoyed everything. One thing though, it didn't state on the menu that the mushroom bop had cheese in it. My colleague doesn't eat cheese so when the dish came, this was a big surprise for her. Luckily the server was super accommodating about this and replaced it for us without hesitation. 

Overall, the food was good, but each dish took SO long to come. I was surprised at how slow a sushi roll took to be served. Good food, but the extremely slow service and sub-par greeting in the beginning made it just an okay experience with room to improve."}
{"text":"I love Katsuya but this location is terrible. The service is bad and you can't even order from the chef when you sit at the bar. I asked what was apart of the \"nigiri sampler\" tonight  and the waiter had no idea, and didn't care to even find out. Take your money else where."}
{"text":"Katsuya is a great place if you're craving some good Katsu with some unique twists. 

I went with the classic pork tenderloin Katsu with their original house special sauce. The Katsu was really crispy yet was still really light and wasn't overly oily.  While the sauce wasn't bad by any stretch, I wasn't a huge fan of it. It didn't taste like anything, as nothing stood out in terms of a specific flavoring. I haven't tried but perhaps you can ask for their sauce separately if you don't like soggy Katsu. The warm sauce really seems to get all soaked up into that outer layer.

The portion size was massive and is quite understandable why they charge what they do here. Too add, I do appreciate that they offer unlimited soup, rice, and cabbage refills with the Katsu meals. They do give you a sizable amount to start off with, so I didn't end up needing to ask for more. But to have that option is a great thing, and that is what they do in Japan. The cabbage was nice and lightly dressed, and there was even some pickles for the extra sweetness if you're craving it.

Service was good, the restaurant? is nice and clean, and there's even some anime playing on the television! Just a heads up: they do not accept credit card here, so bring your debit and/or cash."}
{"text":"Excellent katsuya. Just the right amount of sauce and the pork loin (had the original pork loin katsu) broke apart easily, which is a good sign (means the meat is not chewy and is rather tender). Food-wise, everything was done perfectly. The deep fried oysters were good. Even the takoyaki balls were really good! In fact, these takoyaki balls were the best ones that I've tasted to date. It does not taste like batter, sauce was perfect, and presentation was really good. 

Some things that could be better:
- We were sitting at one of the end booths and the wall was concrete. Maybe replace the concrete with pleather? Or wood? I get that they are going for that Japanese alley restaurant look but the concrete wall had me feeling very wary of it as I felt like I could accidentally scrape my arm against it. 

- Service was good, but the hostess told us that the small box that she gave us for leftovers was \"just enough\". That small takeout box was definitely not enough to contain the food that my friend had on her plate. We ended up getting a bigger takeout box from one of the servers. 

- There needs to be more rice or cabbage salad. I ended up having a lot of meat and sauce leftover (not a bad thing!) but it would be nice to have some rice or cabbage soak up some of the sauce. 


I would have to say that Katsuya is one of the best places for some Japanese curry. Definitely a place to try out. There's a reason why there is always a long wait and that is due to how great this place is!"}
{"text":"Good meal. Love the way they make breaded pork."}
{"text":"Hhhmmmmm this is just a belly rub altogether. Always hits the spot. The servings are massive and it just always satisfies."}
{"text":"I can see why this place is so popular. The pork loin is juicy and the exterior is nice and crunchy. There's a fair portion for ~$15 worth of food. The sets come with unlimited refills of: sushi rice, miso soup, salad (cabbage slaw with some asian sesame dressing aka. incorporating sesame oil + soy sauce probably) 

Curry pork loin katsu set  
DELICIOUS! The curry is so flavourful and isn't super oily. *peanut free*

Original pork loin katsu set 
Nice tomato-ey flavour and has a very unique taste that I've never tried at any other place before! Pretty good! I would definitely recommend this to those who aren't allergic to peanuts. 

HUGE plus for complimentary parking right outside the restaurant. Especially since the general Yonge and Finch areadoesn't accommodate that on weekdays."}
{"text":"Tasty tonkatsu and you're able to top up your salad, rice and miso! Quality ingredients and food is cooked well. Very nice restaurant fit our too. Great value for money."}
{"text":"Made reservations & only waited less than 5 minutes. Was greeted right away. My husband ordered the uni & salmon sashimi, rock & shrimp tempura roll and i got the chawanmushi and the Wagyu Filet with Foie Gras. 

Lets put it this way.. I have been looking for The Japanese place who could serve the chawanmishi the way i'v grown up to back home -- Katsuya's was the BEST iv tasted. And believe me when i say - my husband and i dine at a lot of japanese places & we usually get disappointed. Uni & salmon sashimi was so fresh & my wagyu & foie gras was cooked to perfection! It was so good i had my husband taste it & he had to order one for himself! 

Service was great. Food was excellent. Ambiance was sheik & classy. 

Will def be back w family & friends!"}
{"text":"Expensive. But you're at a restaurant at the SLS. Really good quality of food. Really good sashimi. My boyfriend and I tried several dishes: chicken wings, several sushi rolls (rolls wrapped with cucumber is our favorite), and the sashimi special. All very good. We only ate here while we stayed at the SLS hotel."}
{"text":"If you want amazing service, food, and drinks, come here and have Jose and Jesus provide you with an amazing time. The sushi is great, and their specials at happy hour are too good to be true. Trust me! This is a regular stop on any Vegas trip. The staff is hip, professional, and friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Never disappoints. The chicken is so tender and crisp. I always go to this location and their service has been consistent."}
{"text":"While staying at the SLS, a friend and I ate here for our sushi fix. I'd absolutely recommend their Social Hour (happy hour) drinks and food were totally reasonably priced, even for Vegas! And there were still plenty of options. 

Their specialty cocktails are great. I may even return just for their watermelon cucumber mojito. The white grapefruit Cosmo was also tasty, and both had a good amount of alcohol!

We got the spicy edamame and Brussels sprouts. Both were good but pretty saucy/salty. We ordered the spicy tuna rice cakes because they were boasted as 'the most flavorful item on the menu' which we totally disagreed with. It was probably my least favorite dish we ordered, and most expensive. I'd recommend sticking to their rolls. The double hamachi roll was delicious and the crunchy corn roll was very unique and tasty. 

The staff were all very friendly and they even checked to see if we wanted anything more before happy hour ended, which I appreciated. 
If you're staying at or near SLS, come check this place out!"}
{"text":"We go here on default because you simply can't go wrong. I admit it can get a little pricey but the serving portion is huge (although Im surprisingly able to finish it). The food makes me feel all warm and cozy. First of all, I love Katsu. But Katsu with several options - you got me! All you can drink miso soup and cabbage salad with sesame dressing included - which are on point! Try the Terimayo. It's my favourite.

Also, don't be discouraged by the line up. The turnaround is fast. Remember though to sign up your name and the number of people in your party in the waitlist.

We come here with our baby and there is a room for car seat on the banquet seat. I wouldn't say its super family friendly but it works for us! It can get a bit loud (not too loud) but I have been able to put my baby to sleep with a little help of the baby noise cancelling headphones. I see a lot of other parents bring their kids too so it's not too bad.

Katsuya has grown to be our go-to comfort food restaurant in Toronto. Will definitely be coming back regularly."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night. 

First off, The service is really great. They have trained their staff to be very attentive! 

All of the food was very fresh-- I tried the rock shrimp (DELISH!)

And the seared tuna and yellowtail sashimi plates. Both were good but not mind blowing. The yellowtail was great but I didn't love the sauce they put on it- too much lemon. 

I had the tuna tataki roll and added avocado (definitely a good choice)

I got 50% because they were doing a Vegas local special and I'm glad I did because it's pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Food is very filling. Unlimited rice and salad. Place is very aesthetically pleasing and servers were very nice"}
{"text":"We visited Katsuya in SLS Las Vegas and it was a phenomenal experience. We originally saw a tasting menu for two on travelzoo, but unfortunately we were too late to purchase the deal. So, we called SLS / Katsuya to see if they would honour the deal, and they graciously did!

We went to celebrate my partner's birthday. Right from the check-in, the hostess quickly brought us to our seats and wished my partner happy birthday. Our server, Jennifer, was very friendly, knowledgable, and overall outgoing. The manager, Leslie, was also very friendly and came by our table a few times to introduce herself and make sure we had a pleasant experience. She even wished my partner a happy birthday, which we hadn't expected. We were a bit underdressed but the staff didn't let this affect the level of service we received. Jennifer put a candle on the dessert and also shared very kind birthday wishes. Overall the level of service exceeded our expectations -- we felt quite valued as customers.

The food itself was absolutely amazing. The lobster chowan-mushi was something new to us and was very delicious. Our favourite was the Sahara roll... Never had anything like this! The sashimi was nice and thick. Everything was very fresh. Their drinks were phenomenal as well (I had the watermelon cucumber mojito, and my partner had the -- if we recall correctly -- the burning Mandarin). 

Hands down, we would come back to katsuya Las Vegas. We had a great time and felt quite special as customers!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Service was awesome and I had the carbonara tenderloin. Portion was huge and delicious! It can get very busy here so use the nearby street to park and walk over. The batter on the tenderloin was super crispy and I had leftovers for lunch:) Really dislike those wooden stools that seems to be in many new Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"PRE-REVIEW
It was my last day in Toronto and meeting up with my pen pal before heading back home to the states. So, I thought it was a good idea to randomly choose a restaurant at, you know, random because we were both indecisive, but hungry. We felt a bit of Asian and this is what was decided we should go.

REVIEW
First impression of this place was \"wow.\" It has a very nice aesthetic. Very urban. Staff were very friendly and fun and I told the waiter I'd get what he recommends, which was takoyaki. Now, I've never had takoyaki and have always seen it in anime as something the characters have all enjoyed. The takoyaki are of a fairly big size and let me tell you, the taste is out there. I still remember the taste to this day, a few weeks later. Warm, creamy, and melts in your mouth. You expect octopus to be chewy, but this wasn't the case. Everything just melted in the mouth. I highly highly recommend.

The tonkatsu curry as my main meal was so good. Meat very tender. Good rice to meat ratio . Not overwhelming with flavor, just right. Filling but doesn't make you feel gross. Very memorable. I have been to many restaurants like this, but I have to say this is a super memorable experience. More than satisfied."}
{"text":"Their katsu are really big and there are a lot of different varieties. However the first time I had it, the sauce was too sweet and greasy--not how katsu should be. The second time I went and got the original katsu and it gave me diarrhea. The service is wonderful and they were refilling my miso soup. However their katsu was just not up to par."}
{"text":"I went on Saturday at 5:00 for the start of social hour and had a fantastic time. I think between my friend and I we tried 4 of the 5 signature drinks and amazing all around. The margarita was amazing and with a nice spice to it. Strong cocktails and only $7! The food and atmosphere was lovely as well. Both the bartenders were friendly and the food came out fast which was a plus."}
{"text":"It's always dicey if you give a questionable experience another chance. But, I am so glad I did.  It must've been a fluke before because this place has the makings of my new favorite !  The variety of rolls I tried this time gave me a better feel for how upscale Katsuya really is. The Crispy rice with spicy tuna is what I am going to say is my new \"go-to roll\" that I can't wait to have again! The Spicy albacore with crispy onion was the unexpected but perfect recommendation. My friend from Oregon who I was entertaining was extremely impressed with everything especially the service. She said we have to go back when she comes to town again. Why am I such a fan now? The attention to detail and personalization of any type of service in Las Vegas is hit and miss. Katsuya knows what they are all doing when it comes to food, professional service, attention to each customer and class. Just don't miss this place when you want to have an amazing night!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Katsuya and I was pretty impress with the food, service, and venue.  The location was in the center of the SLS hotel. We were invited into a private room for an intimate birthday celebration. Make sure you make a reservation in advance if you are planning to come in a large group. The staff was very attentive and the food came out fresh and hot. 

They offered a summer special that came with 2 entrees and a dessert for $39.  

Omakase sushi-Chef's selection of nigiri and hosomaki.  Total of 13 sushi: tuna, salmon, snapper, yellowtail, albacore, octopus, spicy stuns, and toro.  Very fresh and will fill you up. 

Crispy tuna sushi that came in 4 pieces. I love the crunch of the sushi rice served with a generous amount of tuna. 
 
Seafood Yakisoba- Generous amount of shrimp, scallop, calamari, mussels, and even a lobster claw served with stir fried with garlic cloves, chives, and sprouts in a hot clay pot. The seafood was fresh and had a lot of flavor with the noodles. 

Mochi Ice cream- Sesame, green tea, and mango flavored!!!! Yum... My fav was the sesame. Mochi was very chewy and tender."}
{"text":"New menu taste very good! Delicious! The pork cutlet with cheese is so juicy and soft.  People may be think the price is high but it is value and reasonable is this area.  Parking may be hard to find, just few in the front."}
{"text":"Katsuya! I heard many good things about this place and I finally get to try this with my friend on a Friday night! We went at around 7 and the lineup wasn't too bad, we waited for around 10 minutes and got a spot.

I like the vibe of this place as it was very hipster-ish and they were playing anime on TV!! We ordered the curry karage chicken thigh, carbonara katsu and Terri Mayo Katsu to share and i was surprised it came with complementary miso soup with free refills!! The curry Karage Chicken Thigh was amazing, the curry flavour was delicious and the chicken was juicy.  The carbonara katsu was surprisingly delicious, the additional of a little spice to make it spicy made a huge difference!  I did not feel heavy at all eating the katsu with carbonara sauce.  The Terri Mayo Katsu was also delicious too, it's katsu topped with their own version of BBQ sauce which gave it a little sweet taste and I really enjoyed it too.  Only think i would suggest is if they give a little bit more rice, it would of been perfect as you can scope up all the sauce and eat it with the rice!

Love this place a lot and will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I got the double cheese original Japanese katsu. It was $13.75. It comes with the katsu, a cabbage salad, sauce, sesame seeds and rice. You can grind your own sesame seeds to put into the sauce. The katsu was super juicy, tender and had a ton of cheese in it, so this is must get for cheese lovers. The breading on the katsu was nice and light."}
{"text":"So I went back a second time and ordered the Katsuya Burger with pork and cheese.   What a mistake.  First, when it arrived it looked pretty...but first thing...something on it was moving......apparently the put Bonita Flakes on the food, which writhe around in the steam...and the flakes are flakes of dried tuna.  Since I don't like seafood, it made the food really unpalatable.  (the dried tuna waving at me didn't  help either)  The bun was soggy and as such I could not pick it up to eat like a burger and the fries were just ok....kind of soft.  

Owners, I suggest you ask people ordered non-seafood dishes if they want bonita. And if I go back I will certainly let them know not to put any on my plate."}
{"text":"Great service with lots of friendly smiles!
No liquor license yet as of 11/15/2017.
Carbonara Katsu is worth a try.
Wish they didn't charge $1.50 for hot green tea."}
{"text":"Pretty solid pork loin Katsuya. Lightly picked cabbage and miso soup also tasty. Can't complain for a $12 dinner (takeout), but not really sure what all the hype is about. I recommend the spot if you want a quick bite at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I was afraid I'd over inflated my expectations for this place, but I'm pleased to say that they were met, and then some!  

First off, the atmosphere is hip and chill. If you are dressed too casually,  you will definitely be the odd one out, but it is not a stuffy scene in the least. The floor plan gives you a wide-angle view of the casino floor. You never forget you're on the Strip, but in the best possible way.

Our server, Mario, was A++. 

Now, for the food.... we started off with the crispy rice and spice tuna. it was the perfect 10 in texture and flavor. That will easily be a go-to the next time I'm here.

I had the crispy chicken salad, the California roll, and, the belle of the tasting ball, the Special Katsuya Roll. The flavors were clean, fresh, and delectable. 

For dessert, we shared the green tea mochi. Yummy! 

Glad we came! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here tonight with 7 girlfriends for my best friend's birthday. One word - PERFECTION. From start to finish. The hostess at the door was sweet, welcoming, and professional. Our server Jennifer has been attentive, fun and all around great. The FOOD!!! Everything we had was so so so good. The Tuna Tataki Roll, Tiger Roll and Yellowtail with Jalapeno are highlights of the menu, but honestly the whole menu is amazing! Eat here, you're welcome."}
{"text":"Coming here for first time after work, friendly staff and atmosphere katsu was lit as shit. the sweet potato cheese katsu and cheese katsu were delicious, cheese was meaty and portions were huge!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! As a vegetarian, I wasn't sure what to expect, but the manager Jesus was very helpful and the chef made some amazing vegetarian friendly dishes. The brussels sprouts were delicious!!!! I never thought I'd enjoy brussels sprouts that much LOL. The bartenders, Jose and Peter were also very helpful and friendly.  My friends and I tried several specialty cocktails and they were all delicious! We were all very impressed and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! I wish I remembered our server's name - She was WONDERFUL!! The food was great too, but the only reason I dinged down one star is because they overcharged my friend's credit card when they adjusted the tip... other than that - it was great!"}
{"text":"Menus were very easy to order with great selections. Friendly staff and clean kitchen and washroom. Definitely a place I would recommend for all"}
{"text":"Katsuya served the best tonkatsu I've ever had in Toronto. It almost as good as the ones I had in Japan, which is pretty damn high praise.

I ordered the pork Carbonara Katsu, which came with a rich creamy white sauce with shrimp, corn and juicy pieces of bacon. The pork tenderloin was fried to perfection that was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The first bite was heaven, no exaggeration.

The boyfriend loves garlic, so he had to order the Garlic Chili Katsu. I found the fried garlic chips too overpowering, but he loved it!

The portions are gigantic. Each dish comes with rice, salad and endless miso soup. I was only able to finish half of my plate (really enjoyed having leftovers the next day), so I think it's definitely worth the price. Next time, the boyfriend and I are excited to split a tonkatsu, probably one of the cheese ones, and try some of their appetizers.

Service was also very friendly and quick. The ambience was lively and fun. Definitely a great place for a date or hanging out with a small group of friends.

I highly recommend giving Katsuya a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pricey but excellent.  Go on a social Sunday when locals get 50% off.  Beautiful decor fantastic sake.   Everything is top quality and service"}
{"text":"We had black cod, rainbowb roll, crab meat handrolls and asahi draft. The best thing was  asahi beer unfortunately. Maybe I was too excited to be here. Black cod was very burned and the portion was small. I saw a picture that other customer took. Mine was all blackened and meager. It was too saucy and salty to eat without rice. We took the blackened skin off. I was expecting more since the dish was $35. Oh well."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of great things about Katsuya so I was eager to try this restaurant when I got to Las Vegas.  

-Rock shrimp appetizer:  I didn't like this dish.  I normally enjoy fried shrimp but this dish was drenched in sauce which made the shrimp mushy.  The sauce that they were drenched in tasted very heavy and mayo based.
-Crab handroll:  This was probably the worst dish I had at this restaurant.  It was very apparent that the crab they used for the handrolls were the pink imitation crab meat.  I wanted a crab handroll...not a california roll.  
-Uni sushi:  Their uni was very fresh!  I loved this one.
-Yellowtail sashimi with jalepeno:  The fish was fresh!  Also a good one to order.
-Tiger and Double Hamachi roll: NO NO NO!!!!  I think both these rolls were $20 each and both featured as their \"specialty rolls\".  Just trust me and do not order. 
-Crispy rice with spicy tuna:  I've had something similar for half the price at Gyu Kaku.  The spicy tuna lacked in flavor.  I would not order again.
-Halibut usuzukuri:  Flavorful!  I liked this one.

For the money spent at Katsuya, the whole experience was very underwhelming.  On a lighter note, our server was really sweet and their miso soup was really good."}
{"text":"I eat here 3 times over a 6 day stay at the W. Each meal was better than the next. 
The first night we were a group of 12. The wait staff and kitchen paced the meal perfectly. The drinks, appetizers and giant sushi boats were all 5 star. 
The second night I ate by myself at the sushi bar. The food arrived promptly and was on point. 
The 3rd night I was with a group of 6. Once again a flawless execution and delivery by the waitstaff. 
Highly recommend: 
Blueberry Sake 
Corn tempura App
Crispy Lobster Sushi. 
Mushroom And Rice tableside cooked dish. 

I will be back next year and will probably eat here 5 out of 6 nights.  Customer for life and you shouid be too. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Wow! I've Katsu before in Japan, and this is a good place to go to if you want authentic or even original Katsu. The place looks nice, the waiters are the sweetest and the portion are really generous for the price. I would recommend this place and come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Located close to Yonge and Cummer Katsuya is a Japanese restaurant that's serving some great Katsu set dishes.  Their menu features different types of Katsu (cutlets) are served 
rice, salad and various sauces.  From stuffed cheese katsu to a spicy garlic sauce or if you're feeling for a traditional katsu, they've got it all. If you order a Katsu set menu it comes with rice and it includes unlimited miso soup and refreshing cabbage salad.  
In terms of ambiance the place is clean, presentable and their service is friendly. 
Average price of a katsu set was between $11-$15.

For food Jen ordered their traditional Japanse Katsu stuffed with Cheese which was delicious.  This came with a sesame seed sauce used to compliment the cutlet.
As for me, I ordered their chili garlic katsu.  Covered with thinly sliced fried garlic mixed with a spicy sauce on the side, this condimient was packed with flavor. 

Overall, coming here for the first time this place didn't disappoint me. Food, service, presentation, cleanliness and prices all scored well for me. 
For those coming during dinner time, you may be subjected to waiting as there's limited seating.  Same goes for parking."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in toronto! I visited this place with my friend on last week. We ordered carbo tender katsu and garlic chili cheese katsu. I was so surprised because it was a huge portion!! Very crispy and delicious. Also, the meat was juicy. Amazingly delicious sauce. They give you unlimit refill for rice, miso soup, and salad. Great atmosphere and excellent customer service. I love this place. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Glad to finally see Katsuya come to Mississauga. While located in an inconspicuous plaza, the restaurant is beautifully furnished with ample parking. 

The flavours are bold and the quality is exactly like the YNF location. Only downside is once i eat a whole plate i cant eat pork katsu for months, given how rich and heavy the meal is.

Would definitely recommend anyone to try out this restaurant. Its a bit on the pricy side but well worth a night out."}
{"text":"Previously known as Mr Tonkatsu (North York branch), Katsuya not only has a new name now, but they have also changed their menu. They still offer the regular katsu sets and sauces, but have now included new flavours such as carbonara tonkatsu and garlic spicy tonkatsu! They also added a double cheese katsu option - filled with mozzarella cheese and cream cheese! 

We ordered the tenderloin katsu with original housemade sauce, garlic spicy katsu with cheese and deepfried oysters. The oysters were a bit too oily but the flavour was good. I would not recommend getting the cheese katsu if you are ordering a spicy or strong sauce such as Garlic Spicy because we could not taste the cheese at all! Nonetheless, their garlic spicy katsu set  and the original katsu set itself were delicious."}
{"text":"I just love it! My favourite is the Pork Tender Katsuya Original!! Omg it just melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"So good.

One of the best places for katsu. They honor the drink offer, so make sure you use it!

Katsu is always done well and service is sort of slow, but not enough to make it a bad thing.  I like their katsu sauce a lot but my SO said she preferred mr tonkatsu.

I really like their carbonera sauce as it has some shrimp and tastes very creamy and rich.

This is a bit on the pricey side, but you are garanteed to be full with their unlimited rice n miso soup. (17$ for an entree with soup n tice+ free soft drink.)"}
{"text":"This is definitely one my favourite restaurants ever. The food is amazing. The service is amazing. There's honestly nothing I don't like about this place. Shout out to Patrick for always being so kind and welcoming to my friends and I! :)"}
{"text":"Although it's  nothing compared to its original spot in Studio City, this one at the SLS Hotel is still really great. It's a fairly decent sized restaurant and it's  good for big parties due to the large squared tables that they have in the center. 

This was a comped meal from a specific group, so everything  was prix fixed. The service  was great and the food was as well. Some of the tastings I had were : Shishito Peppers (big fan), Corn Tempura, Wagyu Filet with Foie Gras (heaven in my mouth) and the Tuna Tataki Roll (pretty good). I plan on stopping by here this coming weekend!"}
{"text":"Ahh... modern Japanese, straight out of LA. One thing is certain when you visit this restaurant (make that three): the food will be beautiful, the space will be beautiful, and it will be jaw-droppingly expensive relative to the portion size.

True to form, the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño ($21) is both beautiful and tiny with just enough sauce to enhance the flavor of the fish without overpowering it. The octopus carpaccio ($19), after you dig it out from under the lemon herb relish, is firm and slightly chewy. The spicy albacore sashimi ($19) is excellent, but like the octopus is buried under other ingredients. In contrast, the wagyu sashimi ($18) is accompanied by a minimal amount of other ingredients that let the savoriness of the lightly seared beef shine.

Service was informative and friendly, without the pushiness to order more. Cocktails, including the watermelon cucumber mojito ($15) went down way too fast.

In the end, we got what we were expecting -- small, delicious dishes at typical Strip pricing that will bleed your wallet dry if you want to leave full. Locals should be on the lookout for SBE Social Sundays when they offer locals a discount."}
{"text":"I came to Katsuya super pumped after reading the reviews and got the carbonara katsu with cheese... it really was super delicious and filling and I was so happy and stuffed... until the next morning when I woke up with the worst case of food poisoning. Not sure if it was the two small pieces of shrimp, the sauce or the cheese.. but I regret ever coming here."}
{"text":"This is one of the best chicken fry places I've been to.

Their gravy selection are all delicious! I would suggest to get the sauce on the side or else your chicken fry will get soggy.

One order actually has 2 HUGE pieces of meat. I could not finish one meal on my own, neither could my date.

The service is above average. Very friendly, warm, and welcoming.

The decor is a rustic style and quite nice to look at.

I highly recommend this place if you like fried meats."}
{"text":"This may not be as fair but 1 star due to terrible service over the phone. I called to inquire if I could reserve, but the worker rudely said no. I then asked for an estimate of how long it would take if I came with a group of 8 in the next ten minutes, but then the worker said \"okay thank you bye...\" Thinking he didn't hear me, I asked again and he said \"sorry we're really busy so bye\" and he actually hung up. He could've responded in a thousand other ways that would've been more respectful and professional, and it could've only taken an addition 20 second. Never going here."}
{"text":"Do you love katsu? Then go here. There is no competition, and it is hands down the best katsu restaurant in Toronto. I am glad that it is somewhat far away from where I live or else I would be eating here everyday and would double in size.

Katsu is a balancing act between the crust and the meat and most katsu restaurants don't have the right balance - they either have too thin of a crust with too much meat lacking that crunch that you want from katsu, or there is too much crust and not enough meat which ends up tasting like you're eating fried batter (which could be what some people enjoy). Katsuya is the perfect balance to me, just enough crunch, and the right thickness of the meat to give it that juicy umami flavour. Nothing compares to it in my opinion.

There are a lot of different options for the katsu, ranging not only in the meats but also with the side sauce. You could choose from curry to their special Katsuya sauce (which I think is quite similar to demi-glace) or just a regular traditional katsu which all comes with sliced cabbage, rice, and miso soup. I do warn you though, their portions are quite massive, and I often have a hard time finishing it all despite having a fairly large appetite.

I can tell that the restaurant is catching on and more and more people are realizing the perfection that is Katsuya. Lines are starting to form, and the restaurant is getting crowded, and I'm sure this review isn't going to help ease that any time soon. It's not a hype so it likely won't die down, it's actually legit good.

Hopefully they will open another downtown location to ease some of the traffic in the near future, but for now this is your go-to spot for katsu in Toronto, nothing else comes close."}
{"text":"This is a Korean restaurant specializing in katsu. I had katsu original flavor and curry karaage thigh. All orders comes with a miso soup and lemonade water but no tea.

The katsu meat is super tender and chewy. And the panko that covers the katsu is amazingly crispy and not oily at all.The original flavor katsu is covered by curry which tastes a bit like the ordinary katsu sauce (a bit sour). 

I would not recommend the karaage. They uses yellow curry and there is no flavor inside the chicken."}
{"text":"We went in for a Saturday night dinner! Had the spicy garlic katsu and the yakatori ! Was amazing, loved it! Really friendly staff, great food! The fried garlic and soft pork tender was great with the spicy sauce! Will be back to try the other amazing choices of katsu!"}
{"text":"3.5, branded place and better than sushi roku.  but not the same playing field as morimoto or matsuhisa, although some imitation.  the crispy rice spicy tuna dish was actually very nice with texture and flavor combo.  if you like sushi samba and get hamachi jalapeño, then these sorts of dishes work.  the robata with short rib is like LA galbi.  the crab handroll was a miss, just a flop on texture and flavor with not enough crab."}
{"text":"Overrated place. Got one of their signature rolls with cabiar and spicy tuna that it was literally flavorless. It is extremely expensive for what it is (after all it is Vegas) the service was ok. The waiter took forever for the check and wasnt really around when we needed her. More of a hang out and drinking place than a sushi place. Leaving very unhappy and hungry (i couldnt even finish my roll)"}
{"text":"First time here, ordered the fish katsu teriyaki and I really enjoyed the fish itself along with the rice. Pretty big portion size, as I was struggling to finish the whole meal. It also came with thinly sliced cabbage but it didn't have any sort of sauce on it so    I didn't eat much of it. I tried eating it with the fish and rice but it was still too bland for my liking. It would have been great if they added something to it or maybe just made it into a salad instead. I really did enjoy the fish katsu itself, it was very flavourful with the sauce, didn't feel super greasy and had the perfect breaded crisp to it. Our waitress was also super nice, came to ask us how everything was a couple times and was very friendly. The place was smaller than I expected but had a cute ambience and wasn't busy. Would probably order their curry next time!"}
{"text":"We had the tasting menu and everything was perfect! Not very expensive at $80/person. LOVED the chocolate cake at the end with the coconut ice cream!! Yum."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Ordered the Original Japanese Cheese Katsu and it was delicious. 10/10 will come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! I ordered the salmon on cedar and substituted my tomatoes for mushrooms - perfectly seasoned and cooked. I ordered the potatoes as a side dish and they were delicious! Grilled baby potatoes, perfectly seasoned atop a mayo/soy sauce concoction. My date ordered the fried chicken as an appetizer and the wagyu fried rice, he loved both! I sampled the wagyu and it was top quality. I love the ambiance and decor. Not very crowded on a Friday night, we were seated immediately. Cannot wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Sunday evening around 6:30pm. The place was already packed. We were promptly seated. Waiting time was not too long. Everything looked delicious on the menu! I ordered carbonara double-cheese pork katsu. Different, but very good. Its was a bit salty from the sauce but the rice helped to reduce that saltiness. Only reason I give 4-star is the thickness of the meat. When I had mr. Tonkatsu downtown Toronto, I could see the texture and the meatiness of the dish. But my pork katsu was very thin. Even my brother's snow white pork katsu was thin. I'm nor sure if that is from pressing down the meat so hard with panko and made it thin. Anyways I was a little dissatisfied by the thickness. There are many Korean restaurants serve tonkatsu with very thin meat. Japanese pork katsu is think and juicy. I don't want to have thin pork katsu at special-pork-katsu place. But I'm going to give second try next time."}
{"text":"Small menu but everything I tried was good! The curry fried chicken was a little lacking in the curry flavor Department, but good nonetheless. They give you three dipping sauces that were very tasty. I had the tender pork katsu with the house sauce. The tonkatsu itself was very good, very light, crispy, and the meat was soft and perfectly cooked. The house sauce was a little bland, and not very noteworthy, and I would request the sauce in a cup for dipping next time. 

Service was very good, and prices were fair. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow! This was my first time here, and I will definitely be back. We came here on a Saturday night around 9:15pm and was quickly seated. The girls greeted us with great enthusiasm and friendliness. After browsing the menu, I opted to try the Terri Mayo as per some of other fellow Yelpers recommendation & my boyfriend the Spicy Garlic Cheese Katsu. 

Not being a huge fan of the Don Katsu dish, I was really impressed with the two dish we ordered. The $3 extra dollar for the cheese Katsu, was really worth it, as the pork loin was a little tough. Overall, for huge pieces of Katsu, unlimited refills on miso, rice and salad , and free pop for checkin, and most importantly impeccable service from the girls there, we couldn't have asked for more."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great experience here. We waited for 4 tables before being seated. It's a small open kitchen setting. We ordered the Curry Chicken Katsu and Chili Garlic Pork with one cheese. Both were very juicy and huge portions of meat. Rice, salad and miso soup are free refills.  The fried batter is light and we especially love how fluffy the chicken was. We were blown away by the attentive service of their wait staff. We accidentally dropped some napkins and one waiter quickly picked up new napkins for us as he brought food out. We had a small mix when the curry chicken was served with pork instead. They offered to give us a new serving of chicken and let us keep the pork. The waiter apologized and checked in on us a while later. Service makes everything better! We will be recommending this place to our friends."}
{"text":"Fried food, taste is ok but not exceptional, I thought it would be better from the reviews."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Strongly recommended. Enjoy with your friends! Have it with a beer. Beat combo in this place . I personally love the Garlic flavor"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with a couple of friends, arriving shortly before noon. The restaurant was empty, so we pretty much had a choice of tables. I'm not a fan of stools, so we took a lower table on the left side of the restaurant. Our server immediately brought over a bottle of water with cups, but couldn't be bothered to pour for us. No biggie. 

After browsing the menu, we decided to share a couple of appies and a selection of mains to share. We chose the udon carbonara, cheese & crab meat croquettes and 3 of the tonkastsu dishes: curry, white snow and traditional. 

I really loved how crispy the coating was on the croquettes as well as the pork. Very light taste, not greasy at all. The croquettes were super cheesy and creamy, with a nice crab flavour. But I think my favourite dish was the carbonara udon. I'd definitely order this again."}
{"text":"A great place to grab Katsu and unlimited refills of miso soup!

My friends and I came in at around 9PM today and we were seated by the windows due to the lack of space to accommodate us. After twenty minutes or so, they let us move to a table where all three of us could sit and talk comfortably 

(Don't remember the names of these dishes 100% so please bare with me!)
We got the pork loin original katsu while my other friend ordered the curry tender katsu. The curry definitely had a strong taste to it unlike the original, and I found to like it more since I'm a huge fan of strong curry. I also found that the pork loin was a lot more tender than pork tender... which sounds odd at first, but I highly recommend the pork loin over the pork tender. The pork loin was soft enough to be cut by a spoon!

Unlimited refills of miso soup are always great. Despite multiple requests from my table for it, the waiters never hesitated to give more to us. I felt like I was treated very well during my visit here!

Some tips:
- they do not accept credit card, but they do accept Apple Pay!
- all tonkotsu sets come with free refills of miso soup (so ordering an appetizer won't get you the soup)
- the seats aren't designed in a way to hold your jacket, but they do have racks on the side

{"text":"Super clean dinning environment and easy communication with the services people. The food was served very quick and fresh. 

Would be good to offer more variety of food or snacks in the futuee. 

Overall it was great"}
{"text":"Eating here was amazing! I had been to a lot of different Japanese/ Korean restaurants and tried their Katsu. However, this one is the best! The cutlet comes out tender and crispy! Also, it is quite big in size as well, and another plus is that you can get an endless refill of miso soup while you dine!"}
{"text":"Friend wanted to come here and saw that this place had good reviews so decided to come check this place out. The menu was simple - just different types of Katsu. I ordered original Chicken Katsu. Came with rice and shredded cabbage on the side and a bowl of Miso soup. The chicken was good, and the sauce that came with it paired well with the chicken. The menu said unlimited soup and salad - we took advantage of it by a few extra round of Miso soup.

Also the food was good but I think it is a bit overrated. Going through the previous reviews and pictures, I can now see why it has 218 review and overall 4.5 stars. The had a promotion some time ago where if you wrote a Yelp review and showed it it them you would get a discount coupon. Guess what kind of review you would write if you had to show them your review to get the coupon? Anyways I feel that the food is decent. Service was so so. The restaurant overall definitely not worth 4.5"}
{"text":"Such AMAZING service. There was a little mishap with a wrong order being given, but the way the staff responded to the event was phenomenal. Once again, this restaurant has such amazing service along with amazing food. It has definitely become one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"My friend was celebrating his birthday in Vegas and wanted to eat here for his birthday dinner. I've been to Katsuya in Glendale, CA three times and hate the place because both the food and service are terrible. I was pleasantly surprised by the food at this location!

I made a reservation for 14 via OpenTable (max party size before menu restrictions), but had it changed to 18 the day of in person without any problems. We actually ended up having 21 people, and were seated in a private room, which was fantastic. We got really lucky getting the private room without having to pay any fees or do any prix-fixe menus, which is usually the requirement.

Since we had such a large party, the birthday boy decided to do omakase for the table to share family-style, so it would be easier. We were served six bowls of Crispy Brussel Sprouts (normally $13 per) and six bowls of Creamy Rock Shrimp ($18). The brussel sprouts were cooked in a balsamic soy reduction with toasted almonds and were sooo bomb. I could eat two bowls of this by myself and be a happy camper.

Then we were served four giant boats with a variety of sushi, sashimi, and rolls. Included were these two small cups of steamed egg which were so delicious. Everything else on the boat was okay, as I don't eat a lot of raw fish. We thought there would be more food coming, including hot dishes, but that was it, so that was kind of disappointing. One of us made a birthday cake and the kitchen was kind enough to cut it for us.

I'm not sure how much everything cost as the birthday boy took care of us (thank you!). My friend did see in the menu that it was $75 for two to do omakase, so I can only imagine how expensive it was. I'm estimating it was around $1,500 because a lot of people also ordered cocktails. Katsuya is definitely not cheap!

The service was okay. We only got our water cups refilled once, so for the second half of our meal, I was dying of dehydration. But to be fair, there was another party of 40 in the restaurant and most of the staff was preoccupied with them."}
{"text":"My fav joint for Katsu! I ordered the pork katsu with cheese - it was hot and not dry, the perfect balance for katsu. The cabbage sauce was delicious too. 

Downside is the wait when the place gets busy and the seating is not the most comfortable. Otherwise great"}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday at lunch and it wasn't really busy. Really enjoy the environment. Though I'm not a fan of bench seating because it's obviously uncomfortable, the food and service makes up for it.

Tried the Spicy garlic pork katsu with cheese. It was massive, the pics don't show how massive the cutlet is. Meat was juicy, lots of flavour in the sauce and tons of fried cheesy garlic goodness.

Overall a nice experience with great service, would come back, but its an expensive lunch, was $17 before tax/tip for lunch."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch, location was easy to find, but there wasn't any parking left in the small lot so I had to park on the street. 

The restaurant is decorated well; has a rustic look, with pipes / taps as jacket hooks etc. 

I ordered the mayo katsu and my gf had the carbonara katsu with double cheese. We had the crab croquettes as an appetizer. Soup/rice/cabbage salad is unlimited so order as much as you want. 

Crab croquettes - they were decent. I could taste the crabmeat but the consistency seemed like they were also filled with mashed potatoes. The sauce they came with were very good though. 3.5/5

Mayo pork katsu - forgot the full name of it, but it is a new item on their menu. It was pretty much takoyako but with katsu. I wasn't a fan of the sauce nor the flakes on it as i don't think it went well with the katsu. 2.5/5

Carbonara Pork double cheese katsu - gf thought the double cheese was too much (mozzarella + cream cheese) as it was paired with the already very creamy carbonara sauce. The sauce itself was spicy and flavourful and you can taste Parmesan as well. 3/5

The portions were LARGE you're getting close to 10 strips along with a bowl of soup, rice and cabbage salad. On the expensive side as well, ranging from 14-17 per meal."}
{"text":"I give a 2 star rating, but my husband rate this place a four. So we average a 3. 

Nice ambience and cheerful music. Misleading photos on the menu. Cabbage instead of broccoli. 

Very crispy but not as flavourful. Not enough curry sauce. Repetitive taste."}
{"text":"Tried this sushi.place in the SLS, very good flavor and excellent service. Upscale so usually means smaller portions as was the case here..Favorite item was the Tempura Corn appetizer tasted like the best popcorn on the planet.  Ceviche eel roll and crispy rice were all spot on. Didn't care for the $4 10oz shot glass of Pepsi, but hey its Vegas. Would return as the sushi tasted very fresh."}
{"text":"A surprising sushi and Japanese food place hidden in SLS Las Vegas! Try their certified Wagyu fried rice, various sushi, rolls, sake and also enjoy the super modern samurai decor. Fun place to be. If you really think about it, it's pretty ironic to have sushi in the desert. Definitely fun to be. SLS is a bit far from the strip but imagine if you are stuck there, this place is magical"}
{"text":"This is my second time at Katsuya. Both times the service has been friendly and prompt. The downtown one was less busy than the North York one but maybe because we came at 1pm on a Tuesday!? Love the unlimited cabbage with the dressing. I stick to simplicity which is the original pork tender katsu, it is crispy and well battered. My husband ordered the katsu burger with cheese, which is only available at the downtown location. To both of our surprise the mozzarella gushed out of the pork chop as he cut it open, it was gooey and delicious the fries were crispy too! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Katsuya and it was delicious! I ordered the Katsuya pork loin (12.50$) and the sauce that came with it was very flavourful. You could taste a hint of tomato. I also ordered the tartar shrimp which is like tempura shrimp but crispier. The portion size was decent, I was more than full. Overall a great first time here!"}
{"text":"Quiet envionment?fridendly service and nice food?Delicious source?Will come back again?"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Sat at the bar. Love their sushi. Staff was nice and polite, everything came out in a timidly manner. Sushi was fresh and melted in our mouth. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Jose was great! It was my first time, and he gave me great recommendations on what to order, and had a smile on his face the whole time... great food and service!"}
{"text":"Food was very bland, burnt my mouth because they served it extremely hot. Service was lousy - bad communication. Overall quite disappointing - given the positive reviews, I was expecting a lot more."}
{"text":"Katsuya has been on my to go list for a while. The long anticipated wait was 100% worth it. The restaurant is a little small and was full when we arrived; however, we were promptly seated. The server was very nice- she brought over water and miso soup as we were sitting. 

My boyfriend and I got the curry pork katsu with cheese and a pound of curry karage (thigh). The
The curry karage came with 3 dipping sauces- chili, wasabi mayo, and teriyaki. All very good sauces that compliment the karage well. The karage was super tender and juicy. The portion sizes here are huge- one plate could probably feed 2 people. The pork katsu was stuffed with cheese and super tender. The curry, mild and not overpowering, paired wonderfully with the pork katsu. Everything tasted amazing. 

Overall a great experience with delicious food worth the price! We will definitely be coming back. I also enjoyed the anime playing in the background"}
{"text":"Katsuya is by far my favorite Japanese restaurant. Came here for date night and to check out their $39 summer menu. 

For cocktails we started with a Sapporo beer and the burning mandarin martini. I also had the watermelon cucumber mojito during dinner. 

We split an order of the crispy rice spicy tuna and the corn crunch roll for starters. Both of these dishes are excellent and had really good flavor. 

He ordered the Brussels sprouts, salmon on cedar, and chocolate cake off the $39 summer menu. I ordered the creamy rock shrimp, the NY strip teriyaki, and the bread pudding. 

Our server Matt was very attentive and paced our order so that we could enjoy each dish without anything getting cold. 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First off is that they went pretty cheap on the decor in this place. Figuring its in the SLS it would be really nice. We were seated and started to order immediately. Knowing Katsuya in LA we knew what we wanted. So we ordered some appetizers which were really good then all went downhill from there the entrees were mediocre at best we ordered an array off sushi rolls. Ended up being $100+ per person for that kind of money there are plenty of other restaurants to choose from. I won't be coming to the SLS nor this restaurant again!

Sorry but the new north is not the south!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Katsuya and the I've never had more fresh fish. It may be a little bit more pricer than your average sushi joint but it's definitely worth it. I'm new to eating raw sushi but it was my first time trying the Special Katsuya Roll which was out of this world. We also ordered the rock shrimp which was great. The garlic edamame was okay not so garlicky more sweet. The sake we ordered wasn't your average sake it was a bit more expensive but worth it. Thanks to Katsuya I can finally have \"real sushi\" lol."}
{"text":"No more driving to North York and Downtown for me! I remember the days me and my friend, KSTARRZ, would crave katsu and there was never any dedicated restaurants for it back then.

Fast forward a few years later now we have one in our backyard!

The sauce and katsu itself taste exactly as the other locations so we are definitely getting the real deal (outside of Japan). No liquor license yet (wanted some Sapporo but I guess that'll come in due time)

Location is a bit off but hey, add Katsuya as another reason to stay in the West End !"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Quiet out of the way next to the Westin Prince. You wouldn't think it was much until you come here. I have always thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience"}
{"text":"This place is the place to get katsu! The crust was cooked to perfection. It was not oily nor burnt. It had the right amount of crunch. I got the teriyaki katsu with pork lion as choice of meat. You can choose several different types of meats including fish.) Mine did not come with much sauce so I could really taste the crunchiness and the bonito flakes. Meanwhile, my friend got the original katsu with chicken. I thought it was soaked in sauce but he enjoyed the amount of sauce as you can put the rice on the sauce. I personally felt it ruined the crunchiness.

I'm not sure if I would come back but this is a place that's definitely work trying if you like katsu."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Loved the sushi here. Also, excellent service! Not to mention, the atmosphere was so calming, edgy, and clean! Very sharp and contemporary. Had a great time here! Loved the drinks as well! Will come back when I'm in Vegas again"}
{"text":"We had the cheese tonKatsu with garlic and spicy sauce. Really friendly service, delicious food: tender with a crispy crust. Just remember that the portions are very generous!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing--fantastic food, kind staff, and free refills of soup, salad and rice?! Are you serious!!! Such a cozy restaurant for warm, comforting, fulfilling food. I tried the curry kaarage, the hot pork katsu (tender), and the curry pork katsu (tender). The hot and spicy was definitely the winner! Also, don't forget to check in and get a free sodaaaa #YelpPerks"}
{"text":"Expensive , small small amount too much modern style I'm not recommend here at all at all. I stop eat in hotel restaurants I should have stay that!! Just waste money"}
{"text":"We ordered the omakaze geta because it looked so spectacular in the pictures. It was a beautiful presentation in a fun meal but I was disappointed that the sashimi was a little boring - tuna snapper halibut and salmon as I recall. The salmon was out of this world, but I was disappointed that for their top-of-the-line meal there wasn't some more exotic things included like sea urchin, scallops, row, things like that. Finally they say that the omakaze geta will feed four but my son and I easily polished it off and ordered several more appetiers and rolls. So I guess, for the price I was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for a casual family dinner a couple months back and tried their udon and the original pork loin katsu set. The udon could've been more flavourful and I personally don't do well with Katsuobushi (dried, fermented, and smoked skipjack tuna) so if you don't enjoy the fishiness, ask for it without. As for the Katsu, it was a good portion and juicy but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is not to be missed - refreshing cocktails (especially the Katsuya Fresh) & delicious rolls at a great price. Our waiter, Jose, was super friendly & gave us fantastic attentive service. The manager, Jesus, was very cordial to make sure we enjoyed our visit. Hidden gem for sure!"}
{"text":"Love the service here!  Everyone is friendly and nice, there's unlimited refills on rice, soup and salad!  The food is also amazing!  It ranges on the pricier side but is well worth the price and service!  The only issue would be that it fills up quick so you'll have to head over early if you want a seat at prime times.  10/10 would go again and have gone repeatedly!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible!!! Food was so flavorful and different with each course. I didn't know what to eat so the manager asked if it would be OK to send out some dishes. Couldn't have been happier!! Best dining experience I've had this far in my time eating food."}
{"text":"Solid katsu place.  Unlike Mr. Tonkatsu, which is more traditional, you get more variants -- like cheese, sweet chili sauce, carbonara, etc.

Tried the sweet chili and tomato sauce with freshly-fried garlic and it paired beautiful on the fried pork.  The lady really enjoyed her fish katsu fish as well.  Hard to say which is better -- Mr. Tonkatsu and Katsuya are both good, I would say Mr. Tonkatsu is slightly better but Katsuya has some great sauces.

The only complaint was the service.  Not sure if they dropped our order, but it was a long wait for us and people that ordered after us were served first.  Also, when they bought us our dishes, the waitress told me they were still frying my garlic and it would be another 5 minutes.  Honestly, a bit odd you would serve me an incomplete dish, so my dish just sat in front of me while I waited.  So, there is no garlic in my picture.  I waited.  And waited.  Until they brought me a bowl of fried garlic and I was too cranky and hungry to take more pictures and wolfed it down.

However, despite this -- the combination of sweet chili, katsu sauce, tomato and garlic was magical.  If you're a garlic fiend like me, I would definitely recommend paying the extra $1 for the fried garlic."}
{"text":"Not worth it. We asked to be sitting in a booth they put us in a corner where I had a chair. we told them it was our first time they brought us an appetizer so the manager wanted to give this to us for first time. We ordered a taster off the menu that would give us a variety they brought is the exact same appetizer that we just had for free. I asked if I could have sparkling water with lime they brought me sparkling water my wife asked for Diet Coke they didn't bring her Diet Coke. We have to request to have lime brought to the table they brought his lemon. we ordered two rolls off the menu recommended by the waitress. having lived in Japan for three years traveled around the world eating sushi all over I would say the sushi restaurant was average at best. As we were eating sushi one of the selected sushi was not good I had to spit it out into a napkin. I told this to the waiter all he did is apologize and shrug it off. The restaurant was half packed at most. The music was loud constant beat. I think we were sitting under an air conditioning vent it was cold we were sitting close to the exit. for dessert we ordered mochi ice cream. I think the tray that they brought the mochi ice cream was not completely clean. Because when we ate the mochi ice cream it tasted like fish. When we receive the bill it was over $200 for two people. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I actually came here with my girlfriend expecting to find Mr. Tonkatsu, but was surprised to find Katsuya serving similar fare and decided to give it a try.

I ordered the spicy chili tonkatsu with cheese. Each tonkatsu comes with rice, salad and miso soup. The neat thing is you can request more rice to go with your meal for free. Onto the tonkatsu, the meat was moist and the crust was crispy. The chili sauce was quite flavourful and went well with the rice, so the extra rice was much appreciated. While I left feeling satisfied, I thought the price was a little high for what you get."}
{"text":"This was the last stop on our food crawl so sharing an entree seemed like a good idea. We'd had some good food so far!

The menu had many choices, mostly variations of breaded and deep fried pieces of meat and/or cheese. We chose a spicy pork loin katsu with cheese. After some complimentary miso soup, we got our order, a huge piece of breaded goodness, served with tomato sauce, rice, and a slaw.

The meat was perfectly cooked and amazingly tender, lots of flavour. The sauce was a good match, not too spicy. I also enjoyed the slaw, albeit a bit understated.

In addition to the great tasting food, the service was excellent, with very friendly servers checking on us frequently. The only drawback to this place is the parking, or lack of..."}
{"text":"Rarely to I get excited by katsu, but Katsuya really delivered a memorable dish!

I came for a weekday lunch with my work team and everyone was delightfully surprised and enjoyed a great meal. The main staple of the menu is the katsu (a breaded thin piece of pork or chicken) but Katsuya takes it to the next level. The katsu can be stuffed with cheese, come in a burger or with noodles. The traditional rice option comes with a wide selection of sauces, from creamy carbonara to spicy tomato-garlic to sweet curry. 

I went traditional and had the Original Japanese Katsu. The katsu was done perfectly, crunchy on the outside while the meat was still moist and juicy. I appreciated the attention to detail in this dish. The katsu rests on a metal grate so it didn't get soggy through the meal. There is a little mortar and pestle to grind up the sesame seeds for the soft white rice. The little pile of cabbage cuts through the grease as you make your way through the meal. Also the portion size here is big! More than enough for lunch and a delicious snack later on. The service is great, helpful and friendly at all times. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Katsuya was definitely the highlight of my trip to Toronto. It was absolutely amazing! We passed by it on the first night and it looked super packed and crowded, so we came back the next day for lunch and it thankfully had open seats. There were also large windows and was brightly lit as a result.

Their whole menu is dedicated to Katsu. They had a variety of options but we ended up getting  traditional Katsu, curry Katsu, carbonara Katsu, and a Katsu burger. They had various protein options for the Katsu too but we all got pork. The traditional Katsu seemed super authentic where you have to grind your own sesame seeds. The Katsu burger was the cheapest but was definitely worth the money. It was enormous and filled with cheese. Honestly, it was a bit overwhelming for me but my friend absolutely loved it.

 I got the carbonara one and it was great. It was super creamy and filling. It had an interesting combination of bacon and seafood but worked well. The Katsu itself was amazingly crispy and tender. Definitely one of best Katsu I've eaten anywhere. Also super nice about the place is that it comes with free refills of miso soup, rice, or cabbage, but the Katsu itself was a huge portion so I didn't take advantage of the refill of rice or cabbage.

The service at Katsuya was very friendly and nice. All in all, it was an amazing restaurant and I would recommend anyone I know visiting Toronto to go there."}
{"text":"Another Social Sunday with 50% off for Nevada residents and I was back at Katsuya for my second time this evening and I was just as impressed as the first time.

This time I ordered the chef's tasting menu which is a five course dinner featuring \"the best of the best signature dishes\" from Chef Katsuya Uechi.  That's a quote from the menu.

Course 1 was an appetizer sampling.  There were four items--creamy rock shrimp, yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, crispy rice with spicy tuna, and spicy albacore sashimi with crispy onion.  The spicy albacore was hands down the best of the four but they were all good.

Course 2 was a ceviche of sashimi with yuzu and lime.  Very refreshing, served with a spoon, but I found it difficult to eat with a spoon so I used my chopsticks.  Much easier!  I believe this was meant to be the first course but it didn't matter.  It was small but very tasty.

Course 3 was miso marinated black cod.  The fish was superb.  Soft, moist, and very flavorful.  It was almost impossible to pick up using chopsticks but I managed to do it. 

Course 4 was the sushi course.  There were 5 pieces of nigiri style sushi.  Pretty standard.  Nothing exceptional but good.

Course 5 was dessert and I asked my server about two potential choices from the ones they serve.  He recommended the Yuzu tart and it was perfect.  A very pleasant, light dessert and a super way to finish this meal.

The restaurant was quite busy and alive tonight.  My server, Ken, was spot on with everything he described.  His knowledge of the menu was exactly what I needed in deciding to do the tasting menu or to order à la carte.  He was efficient, polite, and pleasant.

I really like this restaurant and after talking with a young couple next to me, I know have to come back and try some more dishes from the menu--the lobster dynamite being high on my list.  Eventually, I'll eat my way through the entire menu.  That's not a bad idea."}
{"text":"Very high end sushi place in the SLS Hotel and casino.  I don't know if I would have tried this place had it not been for their excellent happy hour (They called it \"social hour\") menu.  

The manager, Jesus Sanchez, happened to be at the host desk when I approached.  He convinced me to try this place and I was not disappointed.  All of the happy hour prices were similar to what a good sushi places charges normally, however, their food is far beyond what normal places offer.  

I started with the Katsura Ceviche which was full of flavorful fish in a light lime dressing.   The manager then sent over the delightful crispy Brussels sprouts which were like mini potato chips in a balsamic soy reduction.  

There were so many interesting choices for rolls but I ended up getting the Corn Crunch Roll.  Garlic butter-sautéed shrimp and avocado rolled with crispy corn tempura and drizzled with sweet soy.  Excellent!!!  

The happy hour wine was only $7....a bargain for this place and very well appointed. I will certainly be back on my next trip."}
{"text":"All good things:

Good service: we took our sweet time getting there and they had a table ready for us, the waitress was cheerful and friendly

Good food: I got the original pork loin katsu
- crispy but not greasy at all
- airy, melts in your mouth 
- sauce is creamy and rich, but not heavy 

By far the best katsu I have had, out of the tens of katsu restaurants I've been to in my lifetime"}
{"text":"That fish katsu... It's a no from me. 

The main flavour here was oil. I get it, it's fried, but I could barely get through half the fish before feeling repulsed. Maybe I had my expectations set too high? Since fish is a different kind of protein than pork/chicken... Either way, blegh. 

We also tried the takoyaki. Each piece was huge and deep fried. They weren't bad, but rather oddly sweet. Hm. 

On the positive side, I love that they offered miso soup (and refills) to both my friend and I, despite us sharing one main. That tasty bowl of sodium is essential in cutting the flavour of oil. 

Overall, I really wanted to love this place, but the fish katsu is just not worth the money!"}
{"text":"I've heard about the North York location and was really excited when I saw that they opened a location downtown. Everything about this place is amazing. The meat is fried to perfection. Crispy on the outside tender on the in. The sauce is super light and flavourful. The portions are really big. I went with 2 of my friends and we split 2 yet we could barely finish it. 
Would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"I love Katsu and this place knows how to do it well! Cute spot, very cozy feel and I almost feel like I'm in an episode of kdrama. 

This place can seat up to ~30 people. The service was fast and friendly. We went here on a Friday night for a party of 4 and we had to wait 10-15 mins at most for a table. I would suggest looking at the menu while you wait, the menu can get a little overwhelming as they have a LOT of Katsu selection! And btw, it's unlimited miso soup and salad! 

Once seated, I ordered the cheese Katsu ( poke cutlet stuffed with mozzarella cheese) with garlic! It was fantastic! Ooey Gooey cheese with the light crispy texture of the Katsu was a def craving fulfilled experience! The salad was light and crisp, the miso soup was amazing and not too salty. 

We also shared the cheese crab croquettes! A def must try!! And the fried oysters were tasty but the oysters were small. 

Overall I recommend this place if you ever have a craving for cheesy fried grub!"}
{"text":"My sister suggested this place for sashimi and sushi in Las Vegas, so I came here with my family. The interior is pretty simple and clean. Since we came here for Japanese food, we ordered sake and shishito pepper and we just asked them a chef's special sashimi. The server, Matt was serving us extremely kind and friendly with nice smile. Also the chef, Daniel, was treating us extremely special and gentle. 
The food was amazing. My family loves sashimi and tried then from all different places. However this was one of the best sashimi place ever. My parents and my younger sister also enjoyed it. I would definitely come back again if I visit Las Vegas again!!!!

Thank you Daniel and Matt :)"}
{"text":"Always have a craving for deep fry food after a long week.  Katsuya always hit the spot with its katsu (deep fried cutlet) set.  Comes with soup, salad, choice of meat & rice.  Starting at $12.50, you will be fully satisfy.  Definitely the best of its kind in Toronto.  Go for chicken if you want a juicer option.  You can always ask for more soup.  Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a katsu person which sounds insane because deep fried anything tastes amazing, but every time I order it the cutlet is either a shriveled up piece of fried batter or dry as helll. This place completely changed my mind.

I came here with some friends after a long, sleepless day to celebrate the end of abuse-- I mean exams. We were sat by the window and I already loved it because of all the coat hangers! They don't get enough appreciation!! I am always either drenching my bag and coat over my chair, sitting on it, or putting it on the floor. After my celebration we looked at the menu and my sleepy eyes did a little bit of a \"That's So Raven having-a-vision\" look because my, oh my I thought it was pretty steep for katsu ($15-$20 depending on your sauce/protein). No need to worry, it was 100% worth it. 

I ordered the Terri Mayo Katsu (pork loin) and my two friends ordered the Curry Katsu and the other ordered the Original Katsu (chicken). We were brought complimentary miso soup to start that was surprisingly flavourful. Then the katsus arrived and they were hUUUGE. No wonder it's more costly than average katsu; the portions are humongous and you can get free refills on rice. It also comes with a giant tower of shredded cabbage (highly recommend putting the vinaigrette on it before eating it). Not only that, but the katsu was crispy, juicy and very flavourful. Even the bonito flakes packed a punch of flavour which I never taste at other restaurants. The curry katsu was equally as good. It tasted similar to my old favourite curry spot Kaijuu but they're unfortunately closed now. The Original was a little more disappointing to me. The fried chicken part was good. It tasted \"cleaner\" than the pork if that makes any sense. The sauce was where I was put off because it's a little sweet and tart which isn't my preference. Or my friend's (glad I'm not the one that ordered it heh). By the end of the meal I was stuffed and wide awake. Not sure if the latter was caused by the food but who knows?

Obviously coming back to try their other katsu variations and maybe even some appetizers."}
{"text":"delicious food and great atmosphere. wod recpmmend to friends ans coworkers.

{"text":"WOW! This place is the actual BEST. I've been looking for a kaiju replacement since they closed due to the owners of the building raising the rent. And I just cannot explain how amazing they are. From the moment we walked in with a greeting, they were spectacular. The server for the night was so great. He was by himself and he made sure we were well taken care of and was quick to refill things for us and make sure we were doing well. He was so polite and I cannot justify to you how much we noticed how hard he was working. 
Secondly, the food is amazing. You can really tell they have perfected their craft. The breading is crispy, the chicken is moist. The cheese they put inside is either high quality or laced with some sort of drug . We got the curry chicken Katsu and the spicy garlic double cheese. I've also been told the terrimayo is the best one but we were told too late before we ordered. We'll definitely be back and with friends!"}
{"text":"The portions given and the price you pay for is very reasonable. Lots of food for the price - it was also delicious! If you checked in, you were able to get a free pop as well. 

The chicken katsu was so filling and big - I didn't think it was possible. The pictures definitely don't do justice! I was here for lunch on a weekday which it wasn't too bad when it comes to lineups and waits. 

The environment was relatively louder however it was still manageable to talk to the person ahead of you. They have a good selection of food as well which I would definitely try again in the future if I go back. Though it is a little out of the way for me, very close to Ryerson university for the students.

Overall it is worth giving it a try if you haven't before. Staff was nice and friendly as well."}
{"text":"We had the Croquette to start, which may have been my hunger speaking, but they were crispy, juicy, and flavorful, definitely worth it for 5 pieces.

We had the original curry, carbonara, and the katsuya curry in pork tendon and chicken - honestly, all were good choices, just check the ingredients added and pick what you like because you can't go wrong. 

Our favorite was Carbonara, it had little shrimps inside, and I'd choose it with pork tendon again.

Great pricing, nice staff, and delicious food - would come back again and again."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner with my boyfriend because he's been telling me this place is so good and tasted like the katsu's he had in Japan. I'm not really a big fan of katsu's but this place is surprisingly good. The batter is good! I ordered the original katsu and also asked for refills for the miso soup. Overall, I would highly recommend this place if you like katsu's. The downside is that the parking  lot is very small, we had to park on the side streets."}
{"text":"Since coming back from LA, I have been searching for a Katsu place that is up to par with a spot in the west called Wako. Since I heard great things about Katsuya, I decided to take a trip here! I ordered the most popular katsu dish with cheese. Advance apologies as I will be comparing to Wako, but I wish Katsuya's bed of shredded lettuce could be smothered with a thousand islands sauce like the one I'm so used to, but to each their own. The pork katsu was definitely delicious! Super filling and free rice refills! My friend got the spicy cutlet and hers was also delicious. 

I will definitely come back as I'd love to try the curry one! Cute spot too.

Update: I tried the curry one and it was incredible! My friend got the garlic chilli katsu and I think that one might be my fave. It's tangy and very savoury. Love this place. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night and saw an empty parking lot. Don't let that fool you, half of the place was filled up when we walked in.

I was drawn to this place by the high reviews on yelp. Out of all the tonkatsu places I've tried in toronto, this exceeded my expectations. Pricier than others, but they have a wide variety in sauces and meats. Most sauces are on the sweeter side. 

Curry Cheese Katsu: I'm not a fan of sweet sauces on a savoury plate, so the waitress recommended me the curry sauce, instead of the original sauce (it has hints of sweet flavours). The cheese was embedded between the layers of the batter and the meat. The best part of this dish was how light and flaky the batter was - appreciate them pouring the sauce on half of the Katsu only, which they do at most tonkatsu places.

Snow sweet chilli prok tenderlion: Obviously a sweeter sauce (by it's name) and more tender than the pork loin. 

Staff: Super friendly! All smiles :) 

Price: $$, $15 avg per tonkatsu, Cash and Debit only 

Environment: Clean, small tables, may not fit large group of parties all in one table 

Going back to try the carbonara next time!"}
{"text":"What I have tried
+ crabmeat croquette (4.5/5) omg these are the biggest balls i have ever eaten. They all were sooo cheesy and the outershells were extremely crispy. Really really enjoy it

+ carbonara katsu with pork loin (4/5) the sauce was soooo creamy and tasty. There were shrimps and squid mixed in the sauce which went very well together. My bf went crazy about this dish but i kinda got bored as I ate bc it was a bit creamy to my taste

+ spicy garlic katsu with fish (4.5/5) this sauce was a bit spicy to me at first but the more i ate it the sweeter it got. Fried garlic added extra flavour to the dish, really like it. 
- service was fast and attentive
- a bonus for unlimited refills of rice/cabbage/miso soup
- good location for ryerson students
- price is expensive ($15-16/dish) but the portions were huggggeee. Two ppl could be so full with just one katsu and one appetizer. My bf and I didnt know that the portion would be that big so we ordered three dishes and ended up taking half a dish out"}
{"text":"The most amazing sushi experience I have ever had.  I've eaten sushi in many states and this rivals all others in taste and complete experience.   Do not skip the Spanish mackerel -- it was unbelievable. Natasha was an amazing server and the sushi chef Daniel brought us the most amazingly beautiful halibut that melted in my mouth !!!!   Phenomenal and worth every minute of time and penny"}
{"text":"I had an AMAZING dinner here and the food was great. The salmon was very fresh and all of the other fish served had a fresh, non \"fishy\" taste as well. Our server (Jennifer) was top notch and was on top of everything for our rowdy group, which was throwing questions and orders left and right. Would 1000% go back again :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem.  I was so impressed by the menu, service and atmosphere.  The people running this establishment get it, I was blown away by the quality!  Awesome.."}
{"text":"I must say.  I'm still in shock.  This was pretty good.  I had my reservations about having sushi at the SLS.  But wow ... blew me away.  The Ikura sashimi was a piece of art!  Usually it's a bowl with .... a bowl. :)   But this was artwork that looked like a waterfall!  (pic attached).

And what's even better is the chef realized I liked ikura, based on what I ordered, so she sprinkled some extra ikura on my salad!  Also ordered beef and mushrooms.  The beef was so tender it was unbelievable.

I may have to stumble in this direction more often."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place ever since I had Kaiju. We ordered the crab balls and the chicken karaage as apps. The crab balls were filled with potato and imitation crab and saved with salad dressing. It was underwhelming with not too much crab flavor. The chicken karaage had no flavor - not even salt! 

We ordered the teri mayo chicken katsu and the curry chicken katsu. The curry one was not that great. I prefer Kaiju's. The teri mayo one was delicious!! I would order this again. 

They have many choices so I would definitely come back to try more. The staff are so nice and they greet you when you enter and are very attentive."}
{"text":"We did not like this restaurant. We ordered quite a bit off the menu, including most of the signature dishes. For example, the wagyu filet with foie gras came way overdone, we couldn't even eat it and the salmon sashimi with caviar was way overpowered by chopped onions. The lobster dynamite was overcooked and rubbery as well. We dine out a lot in town and this was agreed to be our least favorite meal thus far. Neither of us felt well after. The two rolls we ordered were good, but that was it, and the brussel sprout chips which are the same as Cleo's which we like more! Nice presentation, great service, but the food was simply not good. We should have stuck with my craving for Piero's that night!!!"}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. First timer experiencing any Katsuya anywhere. Located at the SLS hotel and casino which I was staying at for three nights.  I had reservations and opted to sit at a table right next to the sushi bar. It was a Monday so it was on the light side.  


Started off with a cold beer and an appetizer of Karaage chicken which was marinated, had a excellent flavor and fried perfectly. For my main entrée I selected the Omagase sushi combination which was beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked.  At $38.00 the selection of sushi was generous and fresh. Discussed market and new water jet machine we installed. Doing labor only of Marriott Timeshare

Service from my waiter was above average and although my food was pricier then places off the strip it was convenient not having to drive anywhere.

I enjoyed my dining experience at Katsuya and would recommend dining here."}
{"text":"Ive been to many asian restaurants on the strip but nothing tops katsuya phenomenal service great food and great atmosphere the manager was very nice aswell he came to our table twice to check up on us and made sure our expierence went great"}
{"text":"I've had Mr. TONKATSU before and thought it was great aside from the plain cabbage salad that they served. Once Katsuya opened up in it's place, I decided to give it a second try. 

Let me start this off by telling you these portions were quite big and I was unable to finish one plate to myself! Make sure to share with a buddy. Our favourites were the Terry Mayo cutlet and the deep fried oysters! So good with the sauces. People who love okonomiyaki will definitely like the Terry mayo. As for the other cutlets in spicy and cream sauce, those were okay. Nothing crazy! I still stand by on the agreement that Korean bars serve the best pork/chicken cutlets!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong - I still love Katsuya. It's still delicious and portions are still massive. They've opened a couple new locations - one downtown and one in Mississauga and since then, prices have gone up quite a bit from when it first opened. Like... a lot. At least 4 or 5 dollars since my last review, meaning that you are paying about $20 dollars for a piece of fried pork/chicken. 

I used to adore the cheese crabmeat croquettes but I like it a bit less now. Croquettes are supposed to have potato, but there shouldn't be actual potato chunks in the croquette so that you can reduce the amount of cheese and crab meat you put in. If you're going to Katsuya for the first time now, it'll probably blow you away because again, portions are huge and the food is delicious. I understand that Toronto has gotten more and more competitive and rents and food prices have gone up, but I guess I'm quite price-sensitive - I come here a lot less because I can't justify the price for myself. It'll be a occasional treat."}
{"text":"Wow ... this place surprised me w the food options and how delicious they are!! 
Service was great and I will need to come back to try different katsu !! Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant Japonais qui propose des plats originaux dans un cadre ultra moderne.
Les produits sont très bons.
Le prix reste le point négatif de ce restaurant mais cela vaut la peine d'y aller si vous dépenser sans compter"}
{"text":"I definitely wanted to like this place a whole lot but as an avid sushi eater it is just OK for me. The quality of fish was good but they barely gave you any. Customer service was definitely on point, just wish the food was a bit better. I guess my standards were set high because well, is it's Vegas. It definitely all could have had a little bit more flavor or at least more fish."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd find an awesome sushi house in the SLS Las Vegas, but this place blew my tastebuds AND my mind!

Aesthetically pleasing, this restaurant has an upscale feel, Art Deco samurai decor and a beautiful sushi bar area. 

Dress code: you can dress up for a romantic dinner or dress down for a chill happy hour. 

Seating: plenty of seating is provided around the sushi  bar, as well as tables for parties of 4 or more throughout the restaurant. 

Service: prompt, friendly, tentative and helpful with menu selections. 

Food: this place has a good selection of sashimi, sushi rolls, and an assortment of Asian inspired dishes. I highly recommend the happy hour with sake! Absolutely delicious!!!

Such a pleasant experience, delicious food and fun sushi chefs here at the SLS.  I'll definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Katsuya specializes in a dish called \"Tonkatsu\" in Japanese. It's basically a dish consisted of breaded deep fried pork cutlet served with rice and shredded cabbage. Instead of pork, you can also have it deep fried with fish or chicken. What makes this tonkatsu different is the variety of special house sauce that you can pick from. You can also add cheese to the mix to make it all snazzy.

For me these kind of restaurant is hard to review. It looks good, tasted good, smells good, everyone says it's good, the service is great, and the restaurant's atmosphere and decor are excellent. So why is it so hard to write about it, just give it a thumbs up and be done right? NO! I can't because I don't like it.

What's so special about a piece of breaded deep fried meat?! Any respectable chef can do this easily. The shredded cabbage is nothing special either, just cabbage and some vinaigrette. Don't forget plain white rice, perfectly cook white rice. Finally the sauce, the menu says it made from many types of ingredients and made a big deal out of it. I think they charge something like $3.50 for extra sauce! Honestly it tasted like a pureed vegetable soup.

Sorry, but I think this is all packaging and nothing inside. Sadly that's what works these day. People buy it, I don't.

{"text":"As we all know, Las Vegas is one of the most expensive cities in which one can dine. But it is also foodie heaven. One way to do this is Happy Hour! Yes, it's time for another round of...

- - - -- - ---- -------Happy Hour Smackdown!------- ---- - -- - - -

Typical Happy Hour        --=VS=--       Katsuya Social Hour
--------------------------                        ------------------------------
- Choice of 5 appetizers                      + over 20 appetizers
- 2 hours to play, 5-7pm                      + Daily 5-7pm

FOOD & DRINK:
-----------------
Due to SLS's awesome $100 daily dining credit deal (see TIP below for details), I was treated to a most excellent social hour indeed by my big sis Sue K.

We each started out with a **Watermelon Cucumber Mojito $8** minus the simple syrup. Not too sweet, and very refreshing. Perfect way to begin.

When it came time to order, we very nearly overdid it. We thought for these prices in Vegas, we'd need to overestimate food portions. Whoops! 

* Crispy Brussels Sprouts $8 - browned perfectly and dusted with bonito flakes, this ended up being one of my favorite dishes of the night.

* Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño $10 - thinly sliced, very delicious and not even mildly spicy once the peppers were removed (accommodating my spicy allergy).

* Creamy Rock Shrimp $10 - flavorful with a mild kick.

* Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna $10 - amazing blend of texture and taste! 

* \"Karaage\" Japanese Fried Chicken $6 - so well-flavored I didn't even need to use the sauce. 

* Double Hamachi Roll $11 - such a long roll and so much fish! Hamachi both inside and atop the roll.

* Black Sesame Panna Cotta $12 (dessert menu) - good thing we saved room for dessert! Really enjoyed this as the last taste for our very full meal. Nice and light.

SERVICE / AMBIANCE:
------------------------
The bartenders and manager were excellent. It's wonderfully convenient that they are able to serve their full menu at the bar. Super friendly service from every single person, including the busboy/wait staff. Props!

Located in the relatively new SLS Hotel, the decor is simple yet elegantly modern. Whether you sit at the bar or at a table, the view is pleasant and not extravagant, compared to many other Vegas establishments.

TIP: Through the end of 2016, SLS Hotel offers a $100 daily dining credit if you book your stay there. What a great deal!

DATE TIP: Social Hour is definitely more than date worthy. Stuff your date with amazing food at a smaller dent to your budget."}
{"text":"Being a local I rarely come to the strip for dinner. Katsuya has definitely changed my mind when it comes to sushi or their, \"happy hour.\" You are immediately greeted with a warm welcome and it doesn't just stop there. Management periodically checks on guest's to see if everything is to their liking, the server's are knowledgeable with the menu item's and will help you find something to your liking, last but not least, the food never siezes to amaze me. The chef's pay close attention to preparing each dish and is always bursting with flavor.

You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I definitely recommend Katsuya for both visitor's and locals."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!!  It's a modern take on sushi dishes, and I haven't had anything here that I didn't love.  My favorite items on the menu are the Crispy Brussels Sprouts, the Corn Crunch Roll, and the Rock Shrimp Tempura Roll.  The staff is always nice and attentive, and they give great recommendations.  GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy their food.  Definitely a place to go if you're in the area! The pork katsu with cheese is one of the kind."}
{"text":"Make sure you go early especially on a weekend because seating is limited but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"The sushi here was amazing.The toro melted in our mouths. Everything was very fresh. I also enjoyed the cucumber wrap sushi. They have more items on their menu here then the LA location."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday, and it wasn't tooo busy, though there was never more than one table free at any given time). Service was quick and very kind and accommodating. 

We got tried the original Katsu with their home sauce (the sauce is definitely on the sweeter side, so if you are not a fan of sweet and savoury together, this might not be your cup of tea, but you could definitely tell that it was a mix of different ingredients). The carbonera Katsu was good, with baby shrimps even. All the Katsu meals come with ENDLESS CABBAGE SALAD AND RICE AND MISO SOUP! AMAZING!! I also got the chicken wings which were delicious, hot and fresh with three different dipping sauces and a bed of potato chips. My meal didn't come with salad, but our server was really nice and gave me one as well so I had something green :D 

We checked in and got free cans of soda as well, SO DO THAT! 

They don't yet have their liquor license, but it's coming soon! I would definitely come back to try other Katsu flavours they have and eat more chicken wings!"}
{"text":"Delish is all I can say! We got the travel zoo coupon $99 excellent dinner for 2, four-course prix fixe dinner. It was all absolutely perfect! I love the fact that everything on the menu for the coupon is different from the next. My hubby was stuffed! We loved everything and would definitely go back. Sushi was perfect too!"}
{"text":"15.50 for spicy garlic katsu. With all you can eat rice and soup and cabbage. The portion is more than enough for one person. I actually ordered one more rice to take home with half my katsu. The only thing I didn't quite like was the seating. I had those wooden high chairs and during winter with all the jackets and mitts it's hard to find a place for it. Although they had hooks it was near the kitchen wall and I didn't feel comfortable hanging my jacket there. But the food was good I felt that it was better mr. Tonkatsu."}
{"text":"Passed by on Friday lunch time, got attracted by the ad outside , ranking top 100 restaurant in Canada, so decided to give it a try. The pork cutlet was quite tender and tastes as normal pork cutlet. Not sure if other flavor would be more special. Rice and miso soup were quite good, cabbage sald  was fresh. Good place for quick, casual lunch, a little pricy though. Not suitable for dinner, too simple."}
{"text":"How amazing! My friend and I have been serving at restaurants on the strip for over 10 years. We came here during the week and were given great hospitality from manager Jesus, server Chris and food runner/busser Lalo. Our favorites were the albacore with crispy onion, spicy edamame (with a twist) and the black sesame desert. They made sure to WOW our dining experience and finished it off with a beautiful desert platter!"}
{"text":"The double cheese pork katsu carbonara is my favourite there. They have limited free parking there. Price can seem steep but u can easily share a dish with two people."}
{"text":"After visiting Katsuya in Hollywood a couple of years ago, which was fabulous, we thought we would come to the Vegas restaurant at SLS Hotel and Casino. 
We started with Salmon Sashimi, Gyoza and the Creamy rock Shrimp, Salmon Sashimi with Caviar followed by Wagyu Fried rice. 

The shrimp was my favourite at Hollywood, but unfortunately there was no love in this. There was no crisp to it and no spice. 
The Gyoza impressed me with the cute edible crunchy case over it.. 
Sashimi with caviar was a refreshing change to the normal sushi Maki. 
Wagyu fried rice has been given great reviews by a lot of people. 
Dont get me wrong, it was nice.. Wagyu is always good.. but I found the overall dish to oily and I was actually quite disapointed. 
My overall experience was ok.. the server was lovely. 
The wine list needs to be looked into.... I know certain wines from New Zealand and they are more than 500% over cost price. I never like this when I see it in menus and you have to pay $60 for a $8 bottle of wine. 
So, finally, my night unfortunately ended up 4am in the bathroom with a tad of food poisoning. Lets say projectile vomiting was not pleasant. But I felt good once all was out. :( 
I have a feeling I must of had a bad shrimp or two.. but who knows, could have been anything on the spread.

I will venture back to Hollywood I think and give Katsuya another chance, but not sure if I can do SLS Katsuya again.. Sorry."}
{"text":"I love the SLS hotel and when I come here I like to eat at one of the fine restaurants in it. This time I tried Katsuya. I kept changing the reservation time because we were behind on schedule getting ready lol. 
When we got there we were seated right away. I liked  the set up that they got inside. I ordered the wagyu beef with the foie gras. The foie gras was so good, melt in your mouth. Also I got their omakase, which was good. And my friend got the wagyu fried rice. All the food was good here. Only complaint I had was the asparagus that we ordered with it took so long and by the time we were finished eating it came out. Nothing to eat it with so we told them forget it. Other than that I enjoyed my dinner."}
{"text":"I love katsu so I was excited to come to Katsuya to try out. The restaurant has nice looking decor, there are only however 3 parking spots that are a bit tight, if the place is any busier you'll probably have to park on a nearby street.

An order of katsu is around $12-15, and they come with a variety of sauces. I had a normal pork katsu with curry and my gf had the pork katsu stuffed with cheese and a fruit based sauce - which is like an okonomiyaki sauce.

The pork chops are very crispy and tender, however I found the breading slightly unauthentic, the panko that was used seems a bit thinner and lighter than what I normally have eaten in the past. Curry is just normal, it tastes like a typical Japanese curry that you can buy at a supermarket. 

The one with cheese appears to be a very thin pork chop wrapped around a huge piece of cheese and then fried. This one felt a bit of an overload, the portion feels like it can be shared with 2 people! While cheese is nice I think it was a bit too much. The sauce was slightly bland, could've been a bit more spiced and flavourful, it would bring out the dish a bit more if the sauce was better. I wouldn't order the one with cheese again.

There's also unlimited soup, rice and cabbage, so it can fill you up if you need extras!"}
{"text":"Came here at 6pm on Thursday night. Wasn't too packed and staff was friendly and attentive! My friends and I ordered Carbonara chicken katsu , pork loin terri mayo and chicken garlic chili katsu. We also each ordered apps as well. The oysters, cheese crab balls and takoyaki. Everyone was super delicious and portions were huge. Unlimited salad,miso and rice! I couldn't finish and had to go my leftovers!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the SLS/W property for a convention across the street. Had a large group dinner at Katsuya and ate there two more times. Each time the food was amazing and the service top notch. They are so obviously interested in the diner's experience being nothing but positive. Everyone was so sweet to me and brought me things to try. Fantastic service for our group. Try the mushroom bop, the crispy rice with tuna, the Brussels, the lobster and truffle,  the tuna tataki roll and the double hamachi, and the bread pudding. Really can't go wrong there. The happy hour was a fantastic deal! Can't wait to come back. Thank you so much for making me feel special!"}
{"text":"If you don't eat here while in Vegas you are missing out! The brussel sprouts and crispy rice with spicy tuna will change your life!  Matt our server was incredible with his knowledge of the menu and spot on recommendations! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutly delicious. Great service. We went for our 15 year anniversary last night and it was the best meal I have had in years

Service was 5 star as well."}
{"text":"I looooove Katsuya!!! I've tried a lot of katsu in Toronto, and even though Katsuya is a bit far from my house I am totally okay with walking for 20 minutes to come and eat here. 

I haven't tried their original location, but I did see a lot of hype around this restaurant, so I decided to check it out one day. I believe it's a Korean katsu place? I only say this because the staff is all Korean, and they greet us with Korean, while the restaurant has soft K-pop playing in the background... but I digress. (By the way, the staff is really friendly and attentive, thanks for the lovely service!)

The menu has so many different types of katsu! You can change the meat, stuff it with cheese, stuff it with DOUBLE CHEESE (cream cheese + cheese!), and change the sauce. I've tried a few- the carbonara, chili cheese, and the original. I think double cheese is a pretty cool concept, but I couldn't really taste the difference between that and just regular cheese-stuffed katsu, so I recommend maybe not getting it.

The portion is very big! At least, it was a bit big for me. Also, after a while the katsu gets a bit soggy from the sauce, so I recommend maybe getting a separate plate and putting your katsu there to help retain its crispiness. 

I didn't like the crabmeat croquette- it was very, very... mushy? Maybe that's how croquettes are supposed to taste? It didn't appeal to me that much so I'm going to stick with the katsu from now on. So excited to try out the other flavors! 

Tip: get the ones stuffed with cheese!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place and I'd give it a 3.5 star if I could. Keep in mind that parking is limited as it has only three spots available. Otherwise, you can try to park on the side street on weekends and evenings. Cash and debit only. Lunch and dinner hours get busy and you may have to wait in line.

The atmosphere is very casual, similar to a Japanese ramen restaurant.  The service seemed a bit disorganized and slow, possibly because the staff spoke limited English. You often just hear them saying \"thank you\" or \"sorry\"....

Food was good and tasty, but as another reviewer had mentioned, the panko was very thin and it almost seemed like it wasn't coated in all panko.  The katsu could have been crispier. They give you a bowl of miso soup and a side of cabbage salad which were good. I'd come back to try again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some good Katsu in town, I would suggest you to try out Katsuya. They made their own sauce with over 5 seasonal fruits, 10 veggies, and 6 organic herbs. Everyday it's packed, you may want to go a bit early for dinner to avoid the line."}
{"text":"Amazing Katsu! I've been here twice and tried the spicy garlic fish and cheese Katsu. The fish is definitely my favorite. Other positives include; their unlimited miso soup and customer service. As soon as you walk in, you're greeted right away and when you leave, everyone says bye to you. The servers are attentive and always check up on you. 

A couple cons: 
Parking- The restaurant is located in a small plaza and has limited parking (4 or 5 spots). I usually park in the neighborhood and just walk. 

No A/C- There is no a/c so it gets really hot in there during the summer. 

Limited seating- I've been here twice during the weekday and i've had to wait both times because there's only a few tables. 

Price- A bit on the pricier side, and not enough rice for the size of Katsu."}
{"text":"Katsuya is definitely worth trying!  Their service was prompt and friendly.  We both had the pork katsu and each ordered different sauces. The katsus are very generous and perfectly cooked. The breading is light and the pork was very tender. We both enjoyed the sauce selections - I had the hot and spicy, and my partner ordered the original.  Both sauces were very really flavourful. Our meals came with bottomless refills of rice, cabbage salad and miso soup. We also got complimentary crab/potato balls. Glad we gave it a try, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing good things about this restaurant and then we were able to sample a few things as part of a food tour we did at The SLS. This was definitely on our list after trying a few things. Then I heard they were doing 50% off for code members last Sunday and we were sold. 

I made a reservation because I heard they get busy. It wasn't too busy when we were seated at 6, but they filled up fast. The decor and vibe seems like it is geared toward people in their 20's and 30's. It definitely leans more hip than upscale.

For dinner we had the Japanese Fried Chicken, Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna, Rock Shrimp Tempura Roll, and Corn Crunch Roll. The Japanese Fried Chicken was the only disappoint. It wasn't bad, but it lacked flavor and didn't really have anything Japanese about it. The Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna is a signature item for a reason. Amazing! The combination of sweet and crispy rice with spicy tuna is so delicious. The Rock Shrimp Tempura Roll again blended spicy tuna with a sweet tempura shrimp and was our favorite roll. The Corn Crunch roll also followed our love of sweet and spicy. The corn tempura with avocado mixed with well a sweet soy sauce. We were definitely happy with the combinations of flavors and tastes of each dish.

We wrapped with the bread pudding which is the signature dessert. The bread pudding was tender, warm, and full of cinnamon flavor. It was topped with a little vanilla ice cream and a shot of Hennessy. We were told to either take the Hennessy as a shot or cover the bread pudding with it. We chose to drizzle it over the bread pudding and it definitely took the flavor to the next level."}
{"text":"One of the Best restaurants in the city. Katsuya has so many options to choose from and the portions are huge! I usually get the spicy snow cheese katsu. If you are a lover of cheese like me you would so appreciate this option. On top of the Katsu, they have various other options such as karage and takoyoki. Overall food is amazing and the servers are incredibly friendly! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Weren't really planning on having sushi this night but we're so glad that we stopped in! The service was top-notch and the environment was extremely nice.

Food: we had a little bit of everything from the edamame to the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeños to the wagyu sashimi and the Japanese octopus carpaccio, also tried a little bit of the bigger dishes such as the miso marinated black cod the lobster dynamite and let's not forget the A5 wagging fry rice. Hands-down everything we tried was delicious, especially the multiple varieties of sashimi!!! The way the garnishes on the plates were design was very pleasing to the eye.

Service: Julie was amazing! She was very attentive to our needs and always checked up on us to make sure that we were enjoying our meal. Her sake pairing went very well with the items we ordered! She knows her stuff!!!

Overall we are very happy that we stopped in, we can't wait to be back for more!"}
{"text":"Stayed @ SLS and ate here before heading to the house comedy show. GOOD food & decent happy hour prices for Vegas!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is good deal for the portion. i ordered double hamachi roll (huge), corn tempura (not good), katsuya fresh (vodka and sake not sure the dizziness), and chrispy chicken salad (water boiled chicken with some chrispy noodle bits..wont fit the style not japanese more chinese so skip it if you can). with all that, the bill runs about 32 usd. so it's pretty good deal. service is nice. way better than those at the strip."}
{"text":"A great new addition to the Ryerson area!  Inside is bright with Japanese tunes playing.  We had delicious, freshly made katsu. I recommend the Katsuya Original Katsu and the Garlic Cheese Katsu. Both sauces were AMAZING! The latter came with fried slices of garlic which added another dimension of flavour to the dish, just make sure you brush your teeth after  Both entrees were more than enough for us as we ended up packing our meal. Service was efficient and friendly. A great first experience here!"}
{"text":"Had our anniversary celebration there last night. Staff and service were outstanding. Gave us a great booth and all were very attentive. The food was amazing! crispy shrimp was outstanding, and all dishes were fresh and presented in a beautiful way. Thank you...we will be back!"}
{"text":"Lobster truffle chawan-mushi had such complex flavors that blended into a perfect bite.
Special katsuya roll was light and amazing, paired beautifully with the ponzu sauce accompanying.   Mario was there to make suggestions and to help with any needs...in fact the whole staff seemed to want your experience to be the best possible.
Sitting at the sushi bar is like watching artisans work with precision.  phenomenal.
Dessert came as a chocolate cake with coconut ice cream that will live in my dreams...such a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Food is great here.  It's definitely a bit pricey compared to what the service and serving sizes are, but the dishes are unique and the ambiance adds a lot. There are plenty of other options at the SLS and in Vegas as a whole, but I wanted to see how it compared to the short lived location that was in Upper Kirby (Houston).  If my date wouldn't have commented that it was overpriced (coming from her was a surprise) then you know it's pushing it.  Worth going and you will enjoy it.  They carry Amstel Light which is becoming to be a good light European Import that is not on many bar managers order list.  

Plan on having to walk a little ways to it as well which comparatively speaking to some restaurants in casinos, it isn't bad, but if your lady has heels and again...it's a date...it may annoy her a bit.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi and appetizers. I was staying at the SLS W Hotel and this place is in the casino. It's a great bargain for their social hour, 5:00-7:00. Several sushi rolls, appetizers and drinks are at a nice discount. I went 2 nights in a row!"}
{"text":"I finally ventured this side of the city for dinner! 

Upon entering, it looked more spacious than other katsu places - clean, airy and well-lit. The staff were welcoming and quick to escort us to our sits. 

As we were deciding what to eat, the server brought us water and after some time we ordered pork loin with cheese original, chicken original and takoyaki to start.

When the takoyaki came in, I could immediately tell that it was going to be delicious - it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a generous piece of octopus and katsuobushi on top. So when our mains came in, I had an expectation that it was also going to be yummy. The portions are substantial, definitely larger than other katsu places in Toronto - it was a bit oily towards the last few bites. 

Our server was attentive and came to ask a few times if we wanted more rice, miso soup or cabbage salad. Overall, a hearty meal and worth another visit!"}
{"text":"Had a nice time at Katsuya it was my 1st time. Emily Vu was a terrific server. She was very knowledgeable and was on point and just wonderful.. Tirso is wow! he is helpful and just loves assisting his guest. The manager Johnathan was a delight and so was chef Derek, great time and we will be back thank you so much oh and yes the food was superb we had the skirt steak, Brussels sprouts , the dessert tasting, also the crispy rice."}
{"text":"The main reason I am writing this review, other than the fact that this place is awesome is because of the honesty of the staff.  In vegas it is rare that you find such honesty and this place has it in abundance.
our bill was 240 between three of us, and we left a 60 dollar tip. 
My two friends got checks that were for a 100, so mine was for 40 and i wrote in 60, but accidentally wrote my total as 300 rather than 100.  The gracious host called my room and corrected my error which is not something that they had to do.
I have always loved Katsuya, pretty sure I wrote them a stellar review for their hollywood location.  Clearly they have a strong program for training staff, and their food is amazing too!
Go here!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Baked Crab hand roll appetizer in Rice Paper.  Amazing Sushi, Blue Fin Tuna, King Crab and Tamago!!  And impeccable service!!"}
{"text":"Had Katsuya Original the cheese katsu pork loin with mozzerella and fried oysters. It got me on the description and the server recommend us saying it is one of the most popular options. Katusya's house sauce made with over 5 seasonal fruits,10 vegetables, and 6 organic herbs... thus I am very curious about the the flavour of this original curry sauce. It is quite rich and the consistency is like a gravy. It taste like brown butter apple sauce with hint of sweetness and tangy from the seasonal fruits, goes really well with the pork. The portion is generous it is actually nice for me and my friend to share an appetizer and the main. There are lots of options to choose from as well, will be back to try the fish katsu."}
{"text":"Nice decor, I ordered the chicken Katsu and it was well fried. Meat was not dry. The service was attentive. The place is new and clean. Plus close to Ryerson and it was quick."}
{"text":"It was my first visit and I absolutely loved it! Food came fairly quickly and was delicious! I had the carbonara udon and the flavours were great! They also have a free pop promotion if you check in on Facebook! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Chris was an amazing server! Great personality and entertaining...def ask for him. The food was great. Had the brussel sprouts, rainbow roll and nagiri roll- all where  would def recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tried the double cheese terri mayo katsu and it was great.  What impressed me the most was the cheesiness and the huge portions

The top of the pork was decorated with bonito flakes, and drizzed with terriyaki sauce + mayo. The cheese was sandwiched within the pork. The experience of cutting and eating each piece of the katsu was like eating a slice of cheesy pizza where when you lift up each slice the cheese on the sides are so stringy and connected that you dont know how much higher you have to lift the slices before the cheese on the sides break off.

The katsu in general was light but crispy on the outside, yet it was not oily at all which was great.

Parking is limited with 4 spots in front of the restaurant, and they do not accept reservations for Fridays and Saturdays. But all in all the food was great and would come back"}
{"text":"We ended up having dinner here out of frustration with the Dine and Dash fundraiser/tasting event that was being held that night

Nothing good at all to say about the Dine and Dash event, it truly might have been the most UNORGANIZED event I have ever been to, a piss off of a couple hundred bucks for the both of us

Katsuya was the second restaurant venue on our tasting map of the aforementioned event....we just were so fed up with it, we decided to just call it quits there and have dinner at the sushi bar.

It took a few minutes to get the hostess to seat us, but really can't blame her since the host station was in the middle of everyone walking into the bar area for the D&D event

we actually had some nice seats towards the back of the sushi bar
not your traditional sushi bar, but we had a really nice view of the sushi chefs doing a carving presentation of a large tuna for the D&D attendees.

we just decided to go with the Omakase Geta

I'm not sure what our server's name was, he was a young Korean or Japanese kid, but he took our order brought us water.  We had some of the cocktails from the event, so we didn't need additional drinks.
things pretty much went downhill from there

a platter of some type of sushi roll was brought to us by another server, and since we weren't exactly clear as to how the Omakase was to be served, we began to prep our soy with wasabi, and took a bit of pickle ginger too.  About a minute later, our waiter came back and told us that was mistakenly brought to us and our order would be out shortly.  fair enough, mistakes happen, no big deal....BUT then he proceeded to take this dish and gave it straight to the party sitting next to us????? Yes, we did not take any of the rolls yet, but we had bogeyed some of the wasabi and ginger already.  He should have either 1)left the dish for us or 2)taken it back to kitchen to be re-plated or thrown out.  I don't think the group next to us saw what he did, but that does not excuse his action.

Our platter of sashimi and sushi was brought to us about 10 minutes later, and it was a decent looking presentation.  Assorted sushi and sashimi on a wooden serving vessel similar to some of the \"boats\" you see offered at Japanese restaurants.  It was a bit annoying though that again a different server, not our waiter brought this to us, and was not quite certain as to all of the components to our meal.

the sushi itself was nothing special, no real outstanding components to the sashimi either.  I had seen decent reviews of this place so maybe our expectations were too high? although that should never be an excuse for any restaurant....they should all strive to be the best they can be.

in any case, we actually just asked one of the sushi chefs about a few of the different fishes we were served and he was quite a bit more helpful.

I think the only thing that kept the meal enjoyable was my wonderful dining companion.  Always makes for a nicer meal when you have it with a pretty gal!
It was also nice that we enjoyed the drinks offered from the D&D event at the Katsuya bar, since it was only a few steps from our seats, we were able to get a few of the tasty Burning Mandarin's and Katsuya Fresh drinks....like an all you can drink option to our meal!

Our waiter finally showed up after a bit with our bill, I was really contemplating whether he even deserved a tip at all, since other than the removal of the wrong dish, it was the only other time we even saw him during our meal.  I only gave him 15% because he did mention how pretty my gal was when she went to the restroom....I know, pretty shallow, but it was true and was nice of him.
Gave the sushi chef a tip directly too, he deserved it....he actually brought us a small dish of tuna, cheek I believe, really good!

I would give the restaurant maybe 3 stars tops, but the shock of our waiter just moving the mistaken dish to group next to us was a bit much.
not sure we will try this place again, maybe stop by for drinks though, they were pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I loved katsu so this was always on our list to visit. We went on Saturday as the first customers of the day and the servers were all very nice. Tip for the yelpers - check in for a free pop! We ordered the Katsuya original pork katsu and the Japanese Cheese Katsu. The prices seemed quite expensive but the portions were large and honestly I left feeling super full!! It was my first time having cheese katsu and as a cheese lover, it was very nice to bite into the crispy hot katsu with some melted mozza cheese. I also really liked the sauce for the cabbage, it had a nice tang to it. Overall, I would said the best sit-in katsu place I've had in Toronto but hands down, value wise we'd still hafta give it to Kaiju..."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Katsu place in Toronto.. Tender , crisp and light Chicken Katsu was a delight to eat.. Will keep visiting for more.."}
{"text":"SLS Las Vegas had a lot to live up to. I have been to the Katsuya restaurant in Los Angeles and it was unreal . I am really glad I ended up in Las Vegas when the SLS opened up. I had high standards when I decided to take my friends to Katsuya and I wasn't let down. Our server, Chris O, was very knowledgable and was great at helping us pick out our perfect meal. The Katsuya roll was amazing!! Best thing to come to this city in a long time, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great good, awesome taste, and the staff where really friendly.. 200% im coming back love it."}
{"text":"The happy hour menu is great. I had the watermelon drink and it was the best!! And it got me pretty buzzed after 2. So good, it drank like lemonade.
We had 3 orders of the warm carb hand roll, our absolute favorite in any katsuya. And some happy hour dishes.
Never fails.



After many visits, still not tired of the baked crab hand roll! Also the rock  shrimp are very good. My girlfriend loved the baked rice with tuna, I'm not a fan but she ordered 2! We also had the edamame. Ended up not finishing all. 
Had the watermelon mojito again, she loved the margarita on the social hour menu.
6 drinks and 5 dishes for a $100 total, a must try!!"}
{"text":"Very average. I ordered the omakase and while the fish was reasonably fresh it was very uninspired. Simply fish and rice. Could've gotten the same thing at Whole Foods. It also took an hour to arrive."}
{"text":"Pros:
Very well done Katsu
Katsu portions are great

Cons:
On the pricey side

Are you a fan of Katsu?  If you answered yes. than Katsuya should definitely be on your radar.  Fans of this Japanese comfort food will definitely enjoy a meal here.  

We came here with our youngest daughter.  Katsuya is not the most kid friendly.  There are 3 tables on the side that have a padded bench.  You are limited to those tables if you have small children.  The place isn't too big overall so any group larger than 4 could have a tough time finding a table.

We ordered the Katsuya original and I've forgotten the name of the second one but it's basically like a takoyaki flavour one.  Both were pork tenderloin katsu. An order of curry chicken karaage was also ordered.  When it comes to the Katsu, you get an enormous piece per order.  It's one of the biggest I've ever seen at a restaurant.  The katsu was also super tender.  One of the best I've ever had.  I wished they gave you more rice though.  They give you suck a small amount for the size of katsu you get.  Still, it was hard to get mad because the katsu was so good.  The karaage was pretty good too.  It had a hint of curry but it wasn't spicy at all.  That was perfect for my eldest daughter when we brought some home for her.

The only gripe is the price.  You're going to be paying about $15 bucks for the katsu,  The little amount of rice and shredded cabbage you get don't help either.  It's a little steep for Katsu, albeit a very good one.

If you love Katsu, i highly recommend you come here. It's a bit pricey but you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is made well and good portions. 

Like traditional tonkatsu places Katsuya offers free refills on cabbage, miso soup and rice. 

Their pork cutlets are thicker cuts of high quality meat, not much fat and very lean. 

It comes out nice and hot and on a mesh tray so it doesn't get soggy. 

I haven't tried other dishes but I would definitely recommend to anyone craving deep fried meat with rice"}
{"text":"Food and service is always amazing. My favorite is the carbonara katsu. Favorite restaurant in Toronto"}
{"text":"Rating 3.5 stars
Gorgeous decor with 3 different food stations that can be seen from your seat. The staff were attentive,sociable & attractive (good food with a side of eye candy,yes please!). We went earlier because we had a show to go see at a different location & were able to get seated in a booth with a nice view of the restaurant.

You can get a free crispy rice with spicy tuna when you check in & buy 2 full priced cocktails or wine glasses,score. That being said,I had an Eastern raspberry sidecar & a fallen angel cocktail,they were both pleasurable. The martini glasses were rimmed with sugar which complimented the drinks well.

The miso soup was ok but nothing spectacular. The most famous & flavourful dish on the menu is the crispy rice with spicy tuna & it was truly appetizing & had a great texture (4 pcs for 18$ but I got it for free!). The special Katsuya roll was mouthwatering,it consisted of tuna,yellowtail,salmon,scallop,crab & avocado wrapped with rice,soy paper & cucumber served with wasabi ponzu on the side.

The robato hamachi kama was enjoyable but I wish the portion was a little bigger. I always finish my meal with a tamago & just like the miso it was good but didn't blow my mind.

The katsuya premiere cocktails are pricey & the bill reflected that hence the reason the 3.5 stars was given."}
{"text":"In terms of food - probably the best katsu I've had in Toronto. Only reason behind 4 stars is the price as it is quite expensive. It's semi-offset with the unlimited rice, miso soup and cabbage though."}
{"text":"Nice place for Japanese Katsu. I love the double cheese carbonara. The portions are huge and you can get refills on rice and salad. Great for sharing!"}
{"text":"THE best katsu I've ever had. Granted I've never been to japan so I still have yet to be proven wrong. For $14-$18 you can get a ginormous slice of pork or chicken covered in breading and deep fried, slathered in delectable sauce. We decided to go with the sweet chili cheese pork katsu. The $6 crab croquette is also with trying. The portion sizes are very large and definitely filling. I had leftovers of less than half the meal and that was enough to satisfy another meal later on! We also got $5 honey butter fries that were pretty good at first. However, the sugar got a bit sickening throughout and with that much fried food, it didn't seem like such a good idea to take home.

The place seemed pretty busy when we left around 7. With its primarily wood interior, it had a cozy calming effect on diners. There was also unlimited miso soup in addition to lemon water. Service seemed a bit unresponsive as most of our interaction with the waitresses seemed to be initiated by us. No matter, the food was enough to satisfy. The high yelp signs plastered in front of the restaurant and around its walls tell the truth! I would definitely come back to try other katsu's!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer at Katsuya and I've experienced nothing but excellent service! Jesus is an excellent host and takes care of us people in the industry. Courtney you're an awesome server! My personal favorites are roasted Brussel sprouts and literally everything else on the menu lol! Thanks for the hospitality guys! See you soon #TheSupperClub"}
{"text":"Food was great! We ordered the crab croquettes and carbonara katsu. It was large enough to share between two people and tasted amazing. I went to the North York location before and found that the croquettes tasted slightly better there. However, this store had better customer service. Our waitress was super friendly."}
{"text":"The food was superb:) we got the crab croquettes, original katsu, terri-mayo katsu, and japanese katsu. Not gonna lie, but the croquettes stole the show. In my opinion, terri-mayo was the best in flavour and value out of the three that we had. Great ambience and very filling. You could get away with sharing one katsu between two people. They give you free refills of rice and salad which is also great! Would come again to try other menu items."}
{"text":"I had a lunch with a friend. My friend had a carbonara katsu and i had a spicy garlic katsu.
They were both great. Carbonara was little spicy so didn't taste too heavy. I loved little garlic flakes. Meats were tender and juicy. Our server didn't say much but service was prompt."}
{"text":"Another katsu place but I think this one impressed me the most! The katsu itself is huge and juicy, but the sauce choice is very important! They even offer unlimited refills of miso soup, but to be honest, the meal itself is large enough that I'm willing to bet you won't need it. Comfortable seating, but it can get loud inside. Overall I really enjoyed the food and environment and would be happy to come back. 

Parking is very limited in the lot, so you may have to end up parking in the street and walking a little bit."}
{"text":"This place is quite small so make reservations for big groups! I ordered their chicken katsuya and an alfredo udon (can't remember the exact name) to split with my friend. Both items were delicious and came out fast. The slaw that came with the katsuya was actually my favorite part of the dish- so yummy! We didn't know that their miso soups and rice were unlimited refills so we were pleasantly surprised. All in all, a great place for some quick comfort food with friends."}
{"text":"I loved it! They give free refills of miso soup, rice and cabbage. I was really hungry so I got a second helping, but couldn't finish all the sides. Sigh. Haha, I don't like wasting things.

I ordered the double cheese donkatsu with the original sauce. The donkatsu was crispy and flakey and oh so good. I forgot to order the sauce on the side. After a while, it became soggy. I would recommend if you come to order the sauce on the side. I got the double cheese katsu and it was delicious. I really enjoyed the middle the best because that was where the cheese was mostly centred.

Service was great. The waitress came to check up on us once or twice. All food was prompt.

It cost about $17 in total, but was well worth it. I would come again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Checked out this tonkatsu place based off their rating on yelp and I was not disappointed.  It was particularly encouraging when I saw a big poster at the front of their shop saying that they were one of the top 100 restaurants in Yelp for 2016-2017.  

The shop specializes in tonkatsu and have a variety of different sauces to choose from.  They also allow you to choose between pork loin and pork tender or chicken for the meat.  They offer unlimited rice, miso soup and salad refills as well.  The flavours were authentic and the breading was crisp.  Apparently they make the breading in house fresh daily!  It still does not compare even to a standard tonkatsu shop in Japan but it hits the spot.

Tip: they had a promotion for a free pop if you check in on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Wow! I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. After an utterly terrible experience at another sushi joint on the strip, Sake Rok (review previously posted), this place gave our disappointing evening a complete 180.

We arrived only a half hour prior to the kitchen close time, but the friendly staff was happy to seat us without any sense of rush. In the course of conversation with our server, we described our disappointing experience at Sake Rok, after which the manager on duty personally offered to comp us a round of drinks simply for choosing their restaurant as an alternative.

That's before we get to the food... yes, it is pricey. But worth every penny, which is not something I often say about high end restaurants. The fish was insanely fresh and delicious, the flavors bold and unique, and the dishes beautifully presented. We had:
-Crispy rice with spicy tuna
-Wagyu beef sashimi 
-Tiger roll
-Double hamachi roll 

All four dishes were recommended by the server (and they were not the highest priced items on the menu by any stretch). Wonderful, friendly service and to die for sushi? You can bet this is now one of our must-go restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"While this place is at the end of the Strip in the SLS Hotel, it's a definite must go for the best Japanese food with pizzazz!  They have the freshest sushi/sashimi with flair served up with some Fresno Chili's.  Their Miso Butterfish is grilled to perfection with great Miso taste and not overpowering.   Even their Wagu Steak is better than most Steakhouses, served with truffle butter on a sizzling platter.  Thanks to Ex. Chef Brandon, Jennifer (our waitress), & Dash for making this a wonderful experience !!!  Forgot to mention the Watermelon / Cucumber Mohito was refreshing!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at Katsuya. I've been here twice and was impressed by both experiences.
My most recent visit, I ordered the Japanese Original Katsu (no sauce) in tenderloin.
The pork was very tender with a nice and crisp panko crust. The meat was a decent portion and the cabbage, rice and miso soup was bottomless.
The miso soup was not bad, nothing too special. The cabbage is a nice touch. It had some sesame dressing and goes great with the katsu. My only complaint is if the cabbage could be room temperature instead of being cold, it would be a 4.5 meal.
My companion had the Tenderloin Katsu with curry sauce. The sauce is sweet and mildly spicy. The crispness of the pork was not soggy from the sauce when they served it.
As the only place I'm aware of that exclusively serve Japanese katsu (deep fried food, especially pork chop), their quality is very good. They offer a variety of sauces from curry, teriyaki to cream based. They also have meat options outside of pork. This is definitely a must try in Toronto.
For those from Asia familiar with pork katsu establishment, the meat isn't the same melt in your mouth quality here, but Katsuya is by far the closest you can get.
They also do not take credit, so make sure you have enough cash or debit."}
{"text":"Portions are large and the sauce is fantastic sweet yet a little spicy :D (i got the garlic one)"}
{"text":"Came here and ordered curry cheese pork katsu. After my order has arrived I began to understand why they have that \"extra sauce cost\" option at the bottom of every page. It wasn't even enough to cover my whole katsu. Aside from that, I'd definitely recommend the cheese katsu. Even though I felt a bit grossed out after eating so much cheese+meat, it was still a very good selection imo. The portions are quite big, so definitely go when you're starving. The katsu itself was okay, the ones without cheese tasted a bit dry for me, I wouldn't come here for the katsu quality, but the idea of cheese katsu def caught my attention, if you like cheese, get it!

The waiter was nice enough for us to try some of the sauce before we made up our minds about which ones to order, so I thought that was very nice of the place."}
{"text":"We went to Katsuya on our stay-cation to celebrate Eric R.'s birthday.  It happened to be the 50% off locals Sunday pick.  We did not have reservations so we opted to sit at the cocktail bar.  Our bartender/server happened to recognize me from a past job in town and that made it a very personable experience.  We got there right at opening (6 PM) and ordered immediately.  I had iced green tea (apparently the SLS commissions its own tea plantation for exclusive hot and iced teas) and Eric R. had hot green tea and the Katsuya fresh cucumber cocktail.

Some things we ordered we waited over an hour for, and things our neighbor at the bar got we were told the kitchen ran out of even though we ordered them at the same time (like negi toro) so that was frustrating.  We tried a variety of dishes, including the seaweed sunomono, salmon sashimi appetizer with caviar, and the wagyu beef sashimi with hot oil (Nobu's was better).  We sampled yellowtail, salmon, toro, scallop, and mackerel sushi.  The mackerel was served with thin kelp on top of it.

I also tried a salmon skin handroll which had kaiware sprouts, gobo, and cucumber.  One of my favorite dishes of the night was the mushroom bop - a hot stone pot like dolsot bimibap with arborio rice, a variety of mushrooms, a hint of parmesan, and a sauce that brought it all together so deliciously.  We finished with the dessert omakase which had mochi, yuzu cheesecake, green tea creme brulee, and sorbet.  Service was great though we had a rush of food then a very long wait for the rest of the stuff.  With the half off and a few comps for the wait plus the $5 happy hour cocktails, we ended up right below our dining credit allotment so all we paid was tax and tip - sweet local deal and a great birthday present for Eric R."}
{"text":"Been here so many times and I love it! Delicious. Love the salad dressing!!! I tried the potato cheese croquets which were very large and filling. Wish there was more of the yummy sauce. Also tried the takoyaki twice. Hands down my favourite place to get takoyaki in the GTA. it has the same crispy breading as the katsu. The make the breadcrumbs in house and you can see the loaves of bread that surround the Kitchen. They also give unlimited salad and miso with your katsu, but you probably won't need a refill. My friends and I came STARVING. we had to be at school by 8:30 and got there at 1:30. However half of my group couldn't even finish because we were so full. I tried some from each of my friends. The original and snow chili I felt had okay sauce. I enjoy the pork katsu... My friend who went to Japan said that this wasn't even as good at cheap/low teir katsu places and at some places, they serve the katsu on a rack to prevent the bottom from getting soft which it definitely did at katsuya. All in all, I would come back as well as reccomend this place to friends!"}
{"text":"I was a regular at the Brentwood, Los Angeles location when I lived there many years ago. Katsuya Brentwood was the place I used to go with my friends for a celebration or special occasion of any kind. The food was always excellent...
I haven't lived in L.A. For years now and haven't been to a Katsuya for a very long time. So, when I happened to be in Las Vegas, I was so excited to re-visit \"Katsuya\" again...
Oh boy was that a huge mistake!
The food: My miso soup arrived at a couple degrees, at most, at room temperature. They were kind about replacing it and comp'ing it  from my check but, it was a bit of a reflection of what was to come.
The spicy lobster roll's tempura bits were not hot and too greasy, which makes me think perhaps the oil wasn't hot enough when they cooked it or, it wasn't served when it came out of the kitchen in a timely manner... I don't know. Then my miso black cod was just... Warm. Not hot. The middle part of the fish was so watery and it didn't flake like most of the other miso black cods I've had there. Was it because the fish wasn't fresh? Was it because the kitchen didn't cook it right? Was it because my server didn't bring it out before it cooled? Again, I don't know. 
All I do know is...
This Katsuya is nothing like the L.A. one and, not in a good way."}
{"text":"Banging restaurant in the new SLS. It is a pain to get to because it is so far north of the strip, but it's solid food.

Everything was delicious especially the wagyu and sushi. The service is top notch and friendly and offers great recommendations.

Great place!"}
{"text":"I'd been to one of the LA locations but don't remember it being memorable.  I met up yesterday with friends and had a good time - the cocktails were good as well as the food.  Not big on sushi, but enjoyed the California roll and spicy tuna roll.  The ceviche was ok.  Highly recommend the crispy Brussels sprouts.  The food was enough for the 3 of us to share.  Service was great as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING. The food is bomb af and the portions are huge. It kind of gives me that Kinton Ramen vibe cause of the decor, but it's a little hot inside - they had a small fan and the windows opened but it didn't do much tbh. 

My friends and I ordered the Carbonara Cheese Katsu and the Spicy Garlic Chicken Katsu. The Carbonara one was sooooooo goooooood. It was creamy with shrimps and bits of calamari. I also asked them to make it a little spicier by adding more chili flakes in it. The spicy garlic sauce was also really good, but it was a little overpowering. The fried garlic chips gave it a good crunch. Perhaps they can have the option of ordering a smaller portion and lowering the price instead of paying $18 for a huge dish that a typical Asian girl can't finish all on her own haha. 

Overall, it's a small and cute lil restaurant with amazing food and great service. The waiter even brought us takoyaki as an appetizer and said it was on the house! I will definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!!! A must go-to restaurant in Las Vegas located in the SLS. 
Our servicer Chris is super friendly, knowledgeable, funny. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Very similar to NOBU in so many ways.  From the Hamachi jalapeño, black cod miso to the rock shrimp.  It felt like i was in a trendier, hipper Nobu restaurant.

Dishes we had were

Crispy rice spicy tuna - a nice twist an a spicy tuna dish....good

Rock shrimp - deep fried shirmp tossed in spicy mayo sauce .... good

wagyu robotta - cooked with various mushrooms... alright

Lobster dynamite - lobster baked with mayo and some other goodies ... delish

King crab robotta - grilled king crab legs - huge pieces... delish

A4 wagyu sukiyaki - wagyu strips wrapped in mushrooms and other vege in sukiyaki sauce and a raw egg.  very interesting concept and very good.

A mixed seafood dish with various steamed seafood, potatoes, onions and sausage....pass on this.

Dessert omakase - small bites of yuzu cream cheese cake, lychee sorbet, creme brûlée, chocolate souffle, mocha ice cream and fresh berries.  for $8 this is a MUST ORDER it was all so delicious.

Overall a very enjoyable dining experience, but you may want to pass if you have been to Nobu or Morimoto's before."}
{"text":"Great sushi   really enjoy coming here every time I stay at the SLS or in Vegas. They have a great happy hour menu and wonderful service. You have to try the ceviche and the lobster roll. You won't be disappointed coming here!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was very nice. My partner and I had the carbonara chicken katsu and the curry cheese katsu respectfully. The presentation was quite pleasing. The food is very filling and delicious. Would not recommend an appetizer if you have a small stomach as you will get full very quickly into your main dish. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"One of my mother in law's fav foods has always been tonkatsu. We've been wanting to give this place a try for quite some time - even before the name change from Mr. Tonkatsu. We finally made our drive over for lunch the day after Christmas. 

The restaurant had very limited seating. The biggest table they had available was made for 4. In addition, it felt as if their heat system was not working. We kept out winter coat on through the entire meal and still left shivering. Thankfully our meals came with refillable miso soups to warm us up. 

We sampled a few of their signature items: original, carbonara, and snow sweet chili pork loins/tenders. I couldn't taste the loins and the tenders apart (the tenders were about a dollar more). My husband though thought the tenders were a bit softer. All the tonkatsu were extremely well made. The not smothered by sauce half was beautifully breaded and stayed really crunchy. Wished I asked for the sauce on the side since the saucy half did lose its signature crunch and became soggy. 

All three sauces were very tasty. I especially enjoyed the carbonara (had a bit of unexpected heat) - be warned though, the sauce was heavy - can be overwhelming for someone to eat the entire tonkatsu on this sauce alone. I was glad I was able to cut the heaviness with the tomato based sweet chilli and savoury original. 

Overall - very well done, generous portioned tonkatsu. A little pricy but definitely a once in a while treat."}
{"text":"One of my favourite eats downtown, Katsuya makes great katsus topped with a variety of sauces and flavours. Their menu also includes some interesting fusion items - udon in carbonara and katsu burgers. 

I usually have the carbonara katsu. It's a guilty pleasure because it's a cream sauce loaded with seafood and veggies on a crunchy large katsu. Additionally, I choose the double cheese katsu - it's a katsu loaded with cheese and then cream cheese on the inside. There's so much creamy goodness, it's addicting. The katsu dishes are all served with a variety of different sauces.... the original I'm not a fan of, the curry and chili sauces are good, the terrimayo I wish had more sauce and that the bonito flakes were thinner. The dishes also come with unlimited rice, salad and miso soup. I wish they'd proactively mention or offer this, but instead they rely on you seeing it in the menu.

Unfortunately, they very recently increased their prices and I find it too expensive to eat here. The double cheese carbonara katsu is now $22.54 after tax (before tip).

Service here is ok, sometimes you have to ask multiple times for the same thing but there is one waitress here who is excellent."}
{"text":"The food and drinks from here were just ok! Their Mushroom bop was yummy that we ordered several of these! My only complaint is that prices were much more expensive than other Casino sushi joints that are much better!! Our server was fantastic and very attentive! I would recommend other sushi places in Las Vegas vs this place!"}
{"text":"I already been to Katsuya twice and I will definitely be back more. I got their Sweet Chili Chicken Katsu and it did not disappoint! The service here is attentive and they are really nice! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"In the heart of downtown,  this japanese restaurant is actually run by korean people.   Expect to budget about $20-$25 in the end.  You'll be seated at a table  The portions are big.   When trying out these types of restaurants, I always try to go for the original meal as it gives you the intended taste of a katsu.  I heard that this place makes really good katsu with cheese.   I ended up ordering the original katsu with double cheese and i didn't regret it.  When eating original katsu, make sure you always get the pork katsu.   The tray comes with a small pestle where you can grind the sesame seeds to your liking.  It is a novelty but I'd rather they just give it to me in a bottle and i just sprinkle it on top of my katsu.  

I left feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"I ordered a simple vegetable tempura roll from my hotel room. When I went to pick it up I was told it would be an additional 20 minutes because they had never had a request for this roll before and their was some confusion if they could make it. Really odd. 50 minutes after I placed the order I received my food. It was decent, nothing special and not worth the price. I'm sure it's stellar for fancy rolls and of course seafood lovers but if you just want a simple roll avoid. It's too basic for them to figure out."}
{"text":"First off, I went with a large group for a girlfriends birthday and this was the best decision we could have made! The atmosphere, service, cocktails and food were all amazing. Some of my favorite dishes were: creamy rock shrimp (could eat the entire bowl), crispy rice with spicy tuna and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeños. The prices were very reasonable for the quality we received. Ive been craving this meal since we left. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! We ordered two of the 4 course dinners, every single dish was INCREDIBLE! But, Jose and Tomo were the reason this experience was even better--I wish every server was as great as them. Jose and Tomo made such amazing recommendations, and catered to us the entire time. We WILL be coming back, and requesting them! Thank you for such a great experience! We are happy to be loyal customers now."}
{"text":"A fancy Japanese place inside of SLS Luxe, it has a contemporary menu, with a lot of small eats that you can share with others. Surprisingly empty at 8pm on a Sunday night, we walked in and got seated right away.

We weren't too hungry so we opted to share a bunch of small plates. This included corn tempura, chicken kara-age (deep fried chicken), Wagyu sliders and Mushroom Bop. My favourite out of the bunch was the corn tempura -- it tasted so fresh, the corn was so deliciously sweet, and the sauce was nice and tangy. Mushroom Bop is a close second; it is a Korean-inspired dish (think Bibimbap), with the rice crisped up perfectly by the hot stone pot. However, the other 2 dishes are misses -- I usually like those items a lot but these don't even compare to my usual ramen joint, and we are paying a slight premium.

Service was so-so, I expected better, but then we've been having spotty service experience during this Vegas trip. Maybe I just need to realigned my expectations... but we did have a decent time there, and I expect to try their tasting menu some time."}
{"text":"We had a very friendly waitress and the sushi was amazing . The vibe is very relaxing and still very intimate in a very large space.



Plus they were great with my two girls 2 and 7 months."}
{"text":"It was my first time to visit although I live around here. Overall score is 4.5 out of 5 because of few tables. But the tasty of food was very good. We got extra service, Korokke which was compensated for long waiting. 
Each of us ordered different sauces. The nost enjoyest was sweet chili one. This taste was similar like Korean Yangnyuom chicken (seasoned chicken). 

Very casual place and comfy.
They have only free 3 spots of parking lot. 
It would park better at Wedgewood Plaza if you could. 
Cash and debit only. 
Very busy restaurant and no reservation is available between Friday and Sunday."}
{"text":"We dined here a couple weeks ago for their #SocialSundays promotion for locals (50% off your bill). There were a couple items that were excluded from the promotion: Omakase Geta, Otoro, Chutoro, and A4 Sukiyaki. I was disappointed since I wanted to order the Omakase Geta, but that didn't stop me.

We were sat next to the sushi bar, so I had a wonderful time watching the sushi chefs expertly craft their beautiful dishes. It was very busy that evening and service was just okay. We were constantly wondering where our server was and our beverages remained empty on a couple occasions.

Naturally, I had high expectations because of the stature of Katsuya and the prices to match. However, I was also anticipating it to be all \"hype,\" but I was pleasantly delighted with our meal. Besides some of the typical flavors you could find at any sushi joint in town, there were great surprises. Overall, the food is delicious and although the high prices may be a deterrent, there are several dishes that I would love to eat again.

Katsuya Ceviche ($18): Assorted sashimi, avocado, red onion, radish, cilantro, edible flowers, yuzu and lime dressing, and served with shrimp chips. This was wonderful. It was fresh like you'd expect from a ceviche and the dressing was fantastic!

Salmon Sashimi with Caviar ($25): Salmon sashimi is rolled around a Japanese onion chutney, topped with caviar, and served on a cucumber crisp. The chutney turned a simple dish into something a little more special. I could have done without the cucumber though; it didn't add anything to the experience.

Wagyu Sashimi ($18): The thinly-sliced wagyu is topped with hot oil, young garlic, and chives. The wagyu was fantastic and the oil/sauce was flavorful.

Wagyu Filet with Foie Gras ($39): Filets of perfectly cooked Wagyu with equal-sized medallions of foie gras, topped with a plum wine reduction. This dish was fantastic. The Wagyu was so, so tender and it was just euphoric with the custard-y foie.

Mushroom Bop ($18): It's a take on Korean Dolsot Bibimbap with a hot pot filled with rice, spinach, and miscellaneous fungi like Truffle, Procini, Enoki, and Shiitake. Now, this is a dish I would never have ordered and I was so pleased with it! The flavors were incredible.

Omakase Geta ($150): Lobster and Truffle Chawanmushi, Tako with Cucumber Sunomono, Special Katsuya Roll, Sahara Roll, Baked Crab Hand Roll, Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna, Negi Toro Roll, Assorted Nigiri (Ikura, Uni, Chutoro with Caviar, and Kanpachi), and Assorted Sashimi (Amaebi, Scallop, Otoro, Japanese Red Snapper, Aji, Bluefin Tuna, and Salmon). First, would I recommend ordering the Omakase Geta? Ehh, yes and no. It's a gorgeous, tasty masterpiece that is impossible to capture in one photograph, however, the items offered are rather boring. The exception being the Lobster and Truffle Chawanmushi (I recommend ordering a couple of these to start your meal). Everything else was delicious, but nothing I haven't had at other sushi restaurants (I would pass on the Sahara Roll as it tasted exactly like rolls found at AYCE sushi places). Oh, the Baked Crab Hand Roll was a surprise. I didn't think it was going to be much, but it was great!

Dessert Omakase ($8): Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream, Lychee Sorbet, Chocolate Cake, Yuzu Cheesecake, and Matcha Green Tea Creme Brûlée. I really enjoyed the Yuzu Cheesecake (although it was MUCH too small even to share), Lychee Sorbet, and Chocolate Cake."}
{"text":"Cute place in the corner of a tiny little plaza that has a huge selection of katsu (different meat, different types of katsu), and some appetizers. 

Got the original katsu and tako wasabi. Food came quickly and the portions for both were generous. Katsu had a very crispy and light outer layer and a tender inside layer (lol). Tako wasabi was also pretty good...but then, you can't really screw that up 

Our server didn't really follow up with us with our water/tea, but she was always around so it wasn't too big of a problem for us to get her attention."}
{"text":"Freaking amazing! Leslie the AGM and Chris our waiter were beyond top notch. No doubt I will be going back. With food and service like their's - who wouldn't?"}
{"text":"I've been going back and forth on whether to give 3 stars or 4 stars... Ultimately, it gets a 3.5. If the manager and waitress wouldn't have been so apologetic and kind about what happened, my husband and I were ready to give 2 stars... So, we made an 8PM reservation. Very long week, and we needed a romantic evening out with some amazing food. We showed at 7:40pm and were seated but not at a very romantic table, squished between two other couples, and the music was SO LOUD we could have a conversation across the table. We were literally yelling back and forth to communicate. I get it, SLS is going for an epic club, high class, party all night scene... But does the restaurant need to be louder than the club? I'm 29, so I'm not some old crotchety lady... They took musical ambience to a whole new extreme. 

Jennifer was our waitress, and let me point out that she was TOP NOTCH. This girl is good at her job and our experience was in no way her fault. She was probably the best waitress I've ever had. 

So, we've sat down, Jennifer comes to greet us right away and fill up our water. I order green tea, and 15 min later it comes out luke warm and very flowery. I just wanted some pure HOT green tea. But hey, it's a new experience, so I drank my luke warm flowery beverage. We promptly got the Brussels sprouts, and they were AMAZING. 

Then, 12-15 more minutes for our edamame... And then 20 more minutes for our crispy rice spicy tuna appetizer... And then the biggest wait of all... Over 30 MORE minutes pass after the spicy tuna, waiting for our next salmon/caviar appetizer and yellowtail sushi roll... We can't talk to each other, it's too loud, and my tea is now gone from luke warm to cold... So we give up and ask for our check, we were going to head over to umami burger for the dinner we never received at Katsuya. Jennifer is super apologetic, agreeing it's taken much too long. She assures that the sushi is on it's way, but she's taking it off our bill. The manager comes over and sees if there is anything else she could do and also apologizes. (It was really sweet, but then we became the center of attention... :( ) 

The sushi roll was good but the salmon appetizer was on soapy cucumbers which definitely took away from the freshness of the salmon caviar bite. 

We really appreciate their kindness, apologies, and the personal care after the fact. Jennifer had no control over how the food was coming out of the multiple kitchens, so we don't blame her. 

Am I dying to come back? Not after that, no. We will likely give it another shot in a few months when they've worked out the kinks of having four kitchens. I hope it's a better experience next time... When my husband surprises me with a nice dinner out, it's a letdown when it goes like this. :/"}
{"text":"Rhassan Rocks. Social hour 5-7:30pm. Great quality food. Good drinks. Rhassan makes great drinks too"}
{"text":"I stayed at the SLS hotel and unfortunately found out about this place on the last day. It was a great change from the Northside grille. The sushi was pretty good quality. Not the best I've ever had but tasted fresh. I would highly recommend going for the happy hour menu. You receive pretty nice portions for very fair prices. The sashimi app was good but not enough to split between two people. I also got two rolls which were nicely sized and fresh tasting. The happy hour menu doesn't explain what's in the rolls but you can use the main menu as a reference. I also went dressed in sandals and a cover up and was still sat for service. The service was also pretty quick which can be rare in Las Vegas. If you're staying in the hotel is a great place to eat for lunch or a quick bite during the day!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to see Julie  So friendly and awesome.  Can't beat the spicy tuna crispy rice. Trust me we have tried  still makes this LA girl homesick"}
{"text":"Wonderful service & great food! We had the Japanese fried chicken and a shrimp/avocado roll with tempura corn on the outside ... delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Clean restrooms, friendly staff! Chefs at sushi bar are totally awesome, Stephen was our chef and his entrees were the best I've had! Great place!"}
{"text":"Excellent! First of all, absolutely great service from start to finish! The server was very helpful in explaining the options since it was our first time dining there. She was friendly & attentive and all around wonderful. The food was excellent! Very tasty, well prepared, generous portions and plenty to eat and take home. The limitless miso soup and cabbage were a big hit! Our kids alps loved it which is no small feat! Our best meal so far while visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"Delicious katsu meals that are fresh and hot... you can really tell its made to order. The portions for each katsu meal is enormous. I think the portions need to be made smaller and the price accordingly... Had I known how large the portions were, I would have shared a plate and gotten something smaller. I loved the cheese filled katsu original... but the flavour of the sauce was really lacking. The tastiest katsu was the carbonara katsu... so good!!! I can wholeheartedly recommend this katsu. I also recommend sharing a katsu plate if you arent a big eater... by the end of my meal I felt like I could explode... and sadly katsu doesnt hold up well when taking it home after its been sogged in sauce."}
{"text":"Great spot! Had dinner here during Labor Day Weekend and it was great. The white cosmo drink is refreshing. I had a sushi roll and the waygu beef! Super good! The server recommended the waygu beef and it did not disappoint. The mushrooms and sauce are equally delicious and compliment the dish."}
{"text":"Although I'm not much of a sushi person, I did enjoy my experience at the Katsuya. Our server Boris was very knowledgeable about the menu items and suggested some great happy hour specials. All of their specialty drinks during happy hour were $7 and $5 well drinks. I ordered the Japanese fried chicken with the Jasmine margarita (spicy) and enjoyed it. Not your typical hotel restaurant..."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was really quick. Had the carbonara with double cheese. Yummm. Ask for sauce on the side!"}
{"text":"Great for happy hour in the W/SLS. The rolls contained very fresh ingredients, and the staff was very pleasant. The atmosphere left a little to be desired, but it was early on a Monday evening. 

I was not a big fan of the spicy edamame, and I thought the sashimi was slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my overall experience at Katsuya, from being seated to leaving the restaurant. I tend to refrain from ordering any type of katsu when dining at Japanese/Korean restaurants but I was intrigued by this shop that focuses on katsu. They offer a variety of different sauces and katsu types (e.g. chicken, pork loin, fish). 

I ordered the pork loin katsu with special house sauce, made from 5 fruits, 10 veggies and 6 herbs. The sauce carried a strong tomato and carrot taste, leaning towards a sweeter flavor. I thought it paired well with my katsu and rice. Katsu was great! Evenly coated with a thin layer of hot-out-of-the-fryer bread crumbs. 

I also tried the spicy garlic pork tender katsu. Spicy isn't for me but I LOVED the fried garlic slices. The difference between the pork loin and tender wasn't too noticeable- the loin texture was slightly rougher than the tender. 

Aside from the food, interior was cozy. Rustic with modern touches such as pipe coat hooks and unified wooden pieces. Service was brilliant. Both servers frequently checked in on us and one was observant enough to offer my friend a salad refill. Only downsides are very limited parking and slightly overpriced menu. But I'll be back to try their creative menu!"}
{"text":"This is my fav place to go for delicious crab potato cheese croquettes, super fresh and crispy exterior that when you bite down in filled with gooey cheese .

I also love their katsu carbonara, very creamy and crispy highly recommend."}
{"text":"We flew to Vegas to experience the last hurrah of Summer and try the food scene for us non gamblers +  a show ticket then we're good - 105-degree weather awaited us!
Usually, hubby and I would go to the nearest buffet (our last was at Aria 3 yrs ago) but this visit is buffet-free. So Katsuya here we come. To start, tried the Lobster/truffle \"chawan mushi\" $8 and the brussels sprouts $14 Sooooo gooood worth every bite!!!
Main course was the wagyu beef tobanyaki w wild mushrooms 38 The beef melts in your mouth like buttah!!!
yellowtail sashimi w jalapeno 23 wish there is more serving of this delicious sashimi, crispy rice w spicy salmon 14 first time in my life to try a crispy rice roll. Hubby ordered 2 orders of sake to celebrate the deliciousness.
For just the two of us the total bill is $220 Again it is worth the price. I will not complain for the price, Katsuya exceeded our expectations. I will def, try the happy hour on our next visit.
Hey they even fold their napkins and toilet paper in their restrooms - love it!
Our waitress gave great service too. I did not get her name, she is petite, with glasses and ponytail. Thanks for taking care of us. 
What happens in Vegas, stays in our tummy!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the SLS and ate here on Saturday July 11th. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. Different servers would bring us our dishes out as they came up. Dishes are family style, feeding 1-4 people.  The waitress pointed out some of her favorite dishes.  Good variety from steak to sushi to choose from."}
{"text":"The bathroom here was pretty disgusting. Outside of that, great service and the crispy rice tuna was awesome."}
{"text":"Came to Katsuya for the first time on a cold snowy night and it was the ultimate comfort food restaurant! Friends and I ordered three of the different variations and we couldn't decide who's was more delicious. They give you tons of food and leave your stomach full, warm, and happy. Plus for the price, the amount you get is extremely generous. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing tonkatsu reminiscent of japan. We had a wonderful and very (!!) filling meal here and will definitely return whenever we'll have that sudden craving of delicately deep fried morsels of tender and juicy meat laced with curry (ma fave). 

100% recommended, whether you're a tonkatsu lover or a tonkatsu newbie, this place is where your palate and belly will thank you."}
{"text":"Been there once and will definitely go again! This place has the best Katsu-don with lots of variety to choose from the menu. Although a bit pricey but once the food comes (large portion) to your table I guarantee you that you'll not regret it! For first timers, I'd recommend the seafood curry sauce Katsu-don."}
{"text":"Went here last night for some dinner and was very disappointed! To start the sushi rolls were average at best, not worth 20 dollars a roll.   I then ordered some pan fried noodles that had a mix of seafood in it, and let me tell you it was very disgusting!! It smelled and tasted very fishy!!!! Seafood should never smell or taste like that unless it's not fresh at all!!!  Which I hate to say was not fresh.  Soon as I left Katsura I went straight to my room where I then threw-up the food.  It spoiled one of my nights at Vegas as want not able to go out and have a good time. I also am from Boston and seafood is one of my favorite foods to eat, I also know what is fresh and not fresh. I will not be back there again."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at katsuya. 
The food was very good and service was awesome! 
The server was great! Each of us asked for miso soup 2 times and she served us with a great attitude.
I ordered original katsu (fish) and green tea and the photo shows how much I enjoyed the whole dish.
The combination of the Pickel radish, cabbage, rice and katsuya goes great together and the crumbs were so fresh and light too. Although katsuya is deep fried food but theirs feels as light as sushi to me :-)"}
{"text":"We just enjoyed our fifth time eating at Katsuya, which has become one of our favorites in Vegas.  The food is amazing and the place has a great vibe with fantastic service and truly a feast for the senses.  Our server Jose was once again very attentive and knowledgeable (and a good bartender too!).  Had the wagyu rib eye, which was huge and melt-in-your-mouth delicious! 
 
My other favorites are the wagyu with foie gras and the double Hamachi Roll.  Let me add that the roll is perfectly balanced and simply the best one that I've ever had!!!    
 
Every food choice we've made has been outstanding after trying a lot of what is on the menu.  I'd also recommend treating yourselves to the Omakase Geta sushi and sashimi plater -- great presentation and a delicious mix, yum!  
 
Really enjoyed EVERYTHING and the craft cocktails are yummy - especially the Fallen Angel and Burning Mandarin drinks because of the of serrano chili!
 
Jose and Peter will make you feel like million dollars -- with food that is amazing and service that is amazing, that means your night out will be awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Large portions. Trendy setting. Nice staff. Sapporo beer to wash it down."}
{"text":"Great spot for katsudon! The place is tiny so be prepared to wait. The parking is limited too. Portions for the katsudon is good. Ive been here multiple times and food quality is always on par! Atmosphere and the art of the place is cool too! Kudos."}
{"text":"Been there a few times, and never disappointed! Kinda pricy for a student, but very filling. Also comes with unlimited salad, miso soup & rice. Service was very nice!"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite place to get many varieties of donkatsu! My favourite was the original donkatsu."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. 
All you can eat coleslaw salad and rice.  I wouldn't eat a lot anyways but it's still a bonus.  
The Katsu is crispy and crunchy on the outside and the meat is tender on the inside."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Katsuya for a date night. We were greeted with a warm welcome from the hostess as well as the manager. The wait staff was friendly and the manager was very attentive on how our evening was going.

I highly recommend ordering from there social hour menu.  A great variety of appetizers and sushi ($10-$20) and drinks ($7-$9) at a reasonable price. There Jasmine Margarita is to die for; a sweet twist on the original margarita, with a spicy kick on the rim. I highly recommend trying the Sahara and Double Hamachi Roll!! 

Our experience was a night to remember. We plan on visiting Kaysuya again when we are back in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Everything was prepared fresh, food tasted great and servers were attentive.  I ordered the Katsuya Original which was nice and crisp.  Only wish the sauce was served on the side cause within a few minutes the breading on the katsu became soggy.  Overall good quality and would highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very good! This was my first experience with tonkatsu - a Japanese breaded pork cutlet with sauce - and I loved it. On the waitress's recommendation, I tried the carbonara katsu. 

I will be back."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Prefer curry to those with cream and cheese, which is too heavy for my taste. The place is always busy though. Prepare to wait for a table during lunch/dinner time."}
{"text":"Sat at sushi bar. Had spicy edamame and 8 pieces of sushi. Very tasty, very fresh. Good place."}
{"text":"Went here with family one Sunday and we loved it!! Excellent service & food !!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Got the original Katsuya! There is unlimited miso soup and cabbage salad, so take advantage of that. The Katsu was really yummy and huge, for the price you pay for. The tomato sauce compliments the katsu. I was super full by the time I've finished half of it. 

Service was very prompt, probably cause there were only 3 other tables.

It was my first time trying Katsuya and I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Was not impressive other than their sake selection. 
We had $75 per person deal because we had about 20 ppl. Nothing surpassed my expectation. 
I love rolls, fish whether they are cooked or raw, and salads. 
Cucumber salad had good dressing with crunch cucumber. It was a good dish but nothing you expect from $75 deal. 
Salad was horrible. Veggies weren't fresh and they are mainly made of romaine. I do not expect only romaines from my $75 per person deal especially when they are not even fresh. 
Splice tuna with crunch rice something under-it was ok. 
Miso glazed cod-I've had a better one. 
Toro-I've bad a better one. 
Skewered shrimps - ehh~
Rolls-rice weren't any different from rolls from any local sushi places. They weren't even marinated properly. Lots of avocado and shrimps which aren't expensive ingredients. They weren't even rolled properly. 


All in all, I can have this set of meals under $30 in any Japanese restaurants in CA. 
Their sake was good and our waiter knew what he was talking about. Don't like sake too much but it was sweet and awesomely smooth."}
{"text":"My sister and I were so excited to finally give this place a shot! We made reservations to ensure we had a spot! The server was excellent! I had a good idea of what I wanted to try, thanks to all the Yelp reviews and pictures. She agreed my choices were popular items and also recommended a few others. So we ordered everything she suggested and what I saw on Yelp! LOL Have to say we had a lot of food but it was SO GOOD! The only thing I didn't care for was the ceviche poke and the wagyu sashimi, I can definitely do without those two. But for sure get the double hamachi roll and the other items. I will post pics!"}
{"text":"This review is for the sushi bar.

- Very knowledgeable and friendly chef
- Nice open space
- Nice hum to the place without it being too loud
- The oh-toro was good (as it should be), but it wasn't amazing and oh-toro should be amazing
- The maguro was excellent.  Had a nice bite to it
- The king salmon (farmed) from New Zealand was delicious and I'm not typically a fan of farmed salmon.  Very fatty, meaty flavor
- The hamachi was hamachi.  Awesome buttery goodness!
- The red snapper had more flavor than usual for this fish.  I enjoyed it
- The kampachi had the right texture and also had that buttery/fish flavor mix that I crave
- The engawa (especially the preparation) was delicious.  I love engawa and this was exceptional engawa

Additionally, I always have the chef make me his/her favorite roll.  This chef made some kind of 6 kinds of fish cucumber roll.  It was good, but didn't blow my mind.

The only downer is that there just wasn't much of a fish selection.  The chef said Katsuya used to carry many additional kinds of fish, but no one bought them, so they simplified the menu.  From a business perspective, I get it.  However, it still made me sad."}
{"text":"This popular katsu joint is nice for casual Japanese comfort food.

I'm honestly not a big fan of fried food, but I came here to check it out because of the good reviews. The restaurant is simple (from the food to the service to the interior design), but everything is well done. I know I posted 18 pages from the menu, but don't fear that you'll have decision paralysis - you hardly have any options. They only sell one dish (katsu), and you just pick the base for your katsu (e.g. chicken, pork, fish, etc.) and the sauce (e.g. original, spicy, garlic, etc.). The katsu comes with miso soup, rice, and cabbage, as well.

Overall, it was a comfortable experience, and the food was better than most other fried food I've had. Check it out if you like katsu and just want a simple but good experience."}
{"text":"We tried their curry katsu with rice and Katsuya udon. The portion was perfect. Katsu was very crunchy however if the sauce could be served separated from the katsu would be even better."}
{"text":"Food portion and taste is very good!
Service was excellent, need to wait for awhile as they a not a big restaurant, but seat is very comfortable and kids friendly!
Really recommend!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome spot!  The sushi is fantastic.  I have not had better sushi anywhere.  The fish was very fresh and masterfully prepared. 

The service and kitchen food were excellent as well.  One small point (and the only thing that wasn't near perfect), the wagyu and foie gras was good but the cover it in a plum sauce.  There was nothing wrong with the sauce but it over powered the delicate and flavorful main ingredients.  The dish was still good.

I will definitely return next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is one of the best katsus I've had. Their cheese filled katsus are the best imo and can be ordered in any of the flavors they offer. Rice and side salad are refillable, although I always have a hard time finish just their giant katsus. Perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I think their Carbonara Katsu is a must try! Only down side is seating is limited and if you go during regular meal hours you're bound to be waiting for a while. It doesn't stop the line from accumulating regardless, which says a lot about their food."}
{"text":"First night in Vegas and wanted to check out the SLS so came here for dinner. What a huge disappointment!

Table for seven people was tiny! I felt like I was sitting at the kids table. Ten feet away is where people were able to smoke while we were eating. 

Service was very slow and spotty. Our service was very nice but we never knew when we were going to see him again. 

Food was not very good. We had one dish that was so bad that we sent back. Had another dish that was horrible and learned that they delivered us someone else's custom dish that had cod instead of crab. Waygu fried rice, one if their signature dishes, was not very good. Lacked depth and flavor. 

Waiter did bring out complimentary desserts due to all of our issues, which was very nice but did not make up for our expensive tasteless dinner. 

I do not recommend this place and will not come back!

Side note - the SLS hotel is very underwhelming and also a hotel that I would not come back to. This hotel cannot compare to any other high end hotels on the strip. SLS in Beverly Hills is much nicer."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Thank you Leslie for a wonderful night, I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town!

The sushi was so fresh and delicious, there wasn't one roll I didn't like! The crispy brussel sprouts are TO DIE FOR, you must try them!!  I almost forgot about the cocktails, they are handcrafted and sooo TASTY. I recommend the Melon and Mezcal  smokey and sweet and delicious!"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever!! This is my favorite sushi place.  Given the price and quality, it's A WIN FOR ALL!!
I'm especially in love with: spicy tuna on crispy rice, albacore with crispy onions, baked crab rolls, shrimp, tempura, their amazing brussel sprouts (TRY IT AND LOVE brussel sprouts even if you hated them before!), BSC speciality rolls, and the salmon caviar sashimi.   You get 8 pieces of the salmon caviar sashimi for $20!! 
Great cocktails too!!"}
{"text":"SOLID PLACE FOR SUSHI, the fish was very fresh, especially during their happy hour, worth every penny! service could be a bit more attentive, but overall a very pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Not a bad choice for simple comfort food. Price is slightly pricey for katsu type food but they give good service, no crazy line up, crunchy good quality Katsu, overall good experience. Oh, they have a variety of sauces to try - which makes them different."}
{"text":"SLS Summer Menu valid until 31 Aug 2015: http://slslasvegas.com/summermenus#!

Was here on a Sunday about 7 pm:
- Happy hour (I think 5 pm - 7:30 pm) was only valid at the bar (not restaurant) so sat there.  
- Had the $39 summer menu, happy hour $7 Katsuya Fresh cocktail (high recommended and deceptively strong; regular price is $15) and the happy hour sashimi sampler(?) for $9.  
- Truthfully the Philip Stark design was my favorite part of the restaurant but the food was great and the cocktail was delicious, especially at those prices.
- I've got 2 weeks left to hit the summer menu at Bazaar Meat and Cleo."}
{"text":"Not a katsu fan but most curry katsu dishes are tasty. I also love the carbonara. Give it a try! Usually no lineup. Even if there is a lineup, it's usually quick."}
{"text":"A \"Japanese\" chain restaurant in cities Brentwood, Dubai, Glendale, Hollywood, Kuwait, LA, Las Vegas and South Beach; an NO location in Japan.  It speaks volumes.

Sarcasm aside, and putting it mildly, this is yet another restaurant designed for the gaijin serving faux Japanese fare like silly 15 ingredient sushi creations with even more ridiculous names like a tiger roll or corn crunch roll.  That said, it does a better job than most.

Modern interior, clean lines, and a contemporary vibe provide a great setting for the culinary creations.  

In general, fresh seafood, beautiful, colorful plantings and wonderful presentation that heighten the experience and mask imperfections.

Creative dishes are very good.  A lobster and truffle chawanmushi with its soft, velvety texture, hints of dashi and sweet lobster accented by the earthy finish of truffle is good eats.  The scallop sashimi outstanding.  Brightened by the yuzu, perfect texture with apple and peppery finish of watercress.  The wagyu sashimi, gently seared with oil perfectly accented by the heat and pounced flavor of ginger and bitterness of chives.

Nice selection of wagyu beef dishes including some using A4 Japanese wagyu.  Be careful of the fatty richness.  It's very easy to fill up.  The wagu short rib, rib eye, and skirt steak from the robata grill are a great way to try different cuts and flavors.  The wagyu filet with foie and a plum wine reduction also worthy albeit excessively rich as the plum reduction lacks sufficient acidity to cut through the fat on fat pairing of the wagyu and foie.  Sadly the A4 wagyu rice was excessively oily with a cloying mouth feel paling in comparison to that of BarMASA.

Forget the silly rolls, they are a waste of the very good quality, fresh seafood.  Additionally, the rice for the nigiri is aggressively seasoned, sticky, and compacted with broken grains.  The seasoning takes away from the enjoyment.  Focus on sashimi offerings (ask for any sushi offering as sashimi).  Correctly graded chu and o-toro, very good mirugai, aji, and uni.

Well chosen selection of beer  and very well chosen selection of sake at Vegas resort markup.   

Good service but still showing the \"green\" uncertainty that will go away with time.

Definitely one of the better \"interpretive\" Japanese eateries in Vegas today."}
{"text":"Wow my favorite new restaurant! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted right away and sat immediately! All the staff were really welcoming and friendly. The restaurant is really bright and nice! 
We started our dinner with spicy edamame which was very flavorful and delicious, creamy rock shrimp and brussel sprouts which we did not regret! Everything tasted amazing!!!! The omakase sushi was one of my favorites and the cocktails were on point! Definitely telling all my friends and family about this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Recently opened in Mississauga!

They do have variety of appetizers such as crab croquette, takoyaki, karage and many more (ranging from $6-$12)

At first glance, menu seems pricey especially with their KATSU (from $14-$20, depending on which kind of katsu).But you'll definitely get full with your meal, especially if you order the katsu with double cheese (mozzarella & cream cheese inside) plus, we had the one with original sauce!! And it was good!!!


Plus..... here's a tip: The rice, salad, and miso soup are all refillables!!!!! Definitely worth the bucks!! Also, I suggest that you request for the sauce on the side so your katsu wouldn't get soggy easily."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Sat and waited for 40 minutes without anyone come up to us. Got ignored and had our spot taken by some rude Asian family came much later. DO NOT COME if you want to feel respected in any sense. Food is way too greasy and my friend threw up after eating. 

Ps. People work there are all Korean hence fake tonkatsu and everything else"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of traditional Japanese style Katsu which is usually served plain with Bull-Dog Katsu sauce but Katsuya has fancy up this dish with a variety of sauces like gravy.  I usually like to see Japanese dishes with a fusion flare to it but I'm not quite sure this is going to work.

What makes a perfect Tonkatsu dish?  Is it the bread coating?  Is it the crispness?  Is it the pork?  Is it the sauce?  If you are not a fan of deep fried meat then there's no point in you trying this place.   The menu is quite extensive with so many variety of sauces.  I really don't care for all these fancy sauces like sweet chilli.   We got the Katsuya's house sauce which is like a gravy described in their menu as a mix 5 seasonal fruits, 10 vegetables and 6 organic herbs.  I did enjoy the sauce but if I were to order this again I would prefer the sauce on aside so that I can taste the crispness all the way through to the very end to the last bite!  For each different sauce, you can choose the different meat - Pork Loin, Pork Tender, Chicken, Fish or Cheese.  
A really good Tonkatsu is the cut of the meat when is thick, tender and juicy.   Katsuya did use a real good cut for the Pork Tender and it was very tasty.  The portions were huge so the 2 orders that we had were more than enough for the 3 of us.   We also got the Curry Pork Tender that was slightly different from the sweet Japanese curry that I like but it was still nicely prepared.

I'll definitely be back if I feel like Katsu!"}
{"text":"I've only gotten katsu a couple times before this only because I never thought it was that special of a dish. Katsu at this place is great! Expect large portions and not too crowded interiors."}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant. The pork loin Katsu I ordered was made to perfection. It's so crispy and yummy! However, I strongly suggest that  they should put the sauce beside the pork instead of covering it. 
I will try the Japanese sauce next time"}
{"text":"I love restaurants make good use of social media. Katsuya is definitely a social media friendly place. Don't forget to get free soft drink by sharing your Katsuya photo on Facebook or Instagram and write a review to get discount in next visit. 

Katsuya is specialized in Katsu (Korean style deep fried pork/chicken cutlet). They offer unlimited refill of salad, rice and soup for Katsu meals. They made their own bread crumbs and I think it is better than the other Tonkatsu place. 

I enjoyed my Cheese Katsu very much; I love the cheesy and juicy pork tenderloin. My hubby ordered the Katsuya Original; he liked the special house made sauce but the sauce reduced the crispness. My kids enjoyed the Katsudon and fried chicken wings. The only problem is Korean loves pepper on fried chicken; I need to specifically ask for no spicy, no pepper since my kids cannot handle any hotness. 

Service was very friendly and efficient. They even offered us 4 free pops even though I was supposed to get one from sharing the photo on Instagram. 

The only problem was the limited parking of the plaza. You could find street parking nearby."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had. And I've had a lot of sushi. Went here twice on my recent trip in Vegas. I recommend the Tuna Tataki, karaage, crunchy rice... Actually everything was fantastic. Sit at the sushi bar and watch the masters work."}
{"text":"We all ordered the original one with cheese and it was amazing!! Just the portion was kinda too much for girls but I guess should be fine for a guy. Their karage thigh with wasabi mayo was great too! I'd definitely be going there again!"}
{"text":"Amazing katsu. Some of the best I've had outside Asia. 

Service- 5 star: We arrived as soon as the restaurant opened. We were seated and given water and miso soup right away. They were having trouble with the fryer, so we were given more miso soup and free tea during our super long 10 minute wait. Just incredible, considerate, and amazing. 

Food- 5 star: The miso soup was flavorful but overly salted. The katsu was perfectly balanced with just enough heat and was impeccably fried. 

I would return if I didn't live in Texas"}
{"text":"It was as expected.  Great service, good sushi.  The Katsuya roll was good with the exception of the really soft fish in there (I think it was scallop or shrimp; it just didn't fit in).  Also the Brussel sprouts were exceptional!"}
{"text":"Just had the carbonara cheese katsu. And the shredded cabbage works very well with it. Very appetizing. 

It also goes well with cold beer and the miso soup.

It was a good meal. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Unique flavors, traditional Japanese dishes. Everything is cooked fresh to order, quality is absolutely amazing. The double Hamachi role is excellent. It's a bit pricey... but honestly, totally worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary during social hour. Great value, half price for full portions, and everything tasted great. Drinks were discounted as well! The restaurant is in SLS, so a decent location too. Our server was delightful though I don't remember his name unfortunately. He came by frequently to check on us and make sure that we were enjoying everything, which we did. We ordered at least two sushi rolls, three other appetizers, and two drinks, all entirely off the social hour menu. Celebrated our five years of being fatasses together at a 50% discount so you could say we had a great time :)"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of sushi and you're in Vegas, I suggest you definitely don't want to skip out on Katsuya LV. 
The quality and freshness of the food is truly on point. The sushi chefs truly take their time to present you with quality dishes! I love them all. The creativity and skills of our fave Katsuya chef, Stephen, is something to rave about! We've known him since he was at Katsuya West Hollywood! He is one of the best! Get the Omakase- don't be shy!"}
{"text":"Food- Katsu!! If you're craving Katsu... this is the exact location you should be coming to. They offer various different sauces like the Katsuya blend (their original), sweet chilli, Snow White sweet chilli (cheese and sweet chilli), carbonara, curry, hot spicy, garlic etc etc! Lots of choices. My personal tip when choosing a katsu with sauce is GET THE SAUCE ON THE SIDE*** that's my personal preference because it does get soggy with all the sauce on top. You want it to remain crispy and yum! 

I ordered the carbonara cheese katsu with the sauce on the side. Excellent. Would recommend. After been looking for katsu with cheese inside the Panko layer, I finally found it. Be prepared though, getting the cheese katsu is quite heavy (can't even  imagine what the double cheese is like). Overall creamy, well flavoured with shrimp and bacon bits, different and unique. My friends ordered the Chicken Katsu sweet chilli and Chicken Katsu hot spicy. Both very similar sauces. Just the hot spicy with a little kick to it, a little on the sweet side as well. Sweet chilli is very well balanced, on the sweeter side and would definitely recommend! 

Keep in mind**** all you can refill rice, soup and cabbage salad! Take advantage ;)

Service- Excellent. Though we asked for sauce on the side, one of the orders came out with sauce on top of the katsu. The kitchen quickly realized their mistake as soon as the order came out (without me even opening up my mouth) and they quickly replaced it allowing me to nibble at the katsu pieces while they were re-making the proper order. 

Price- ranges from about $12 to their more expensive katsu about $16.75. 

Parking- only abut 4 parking spots dedicated to this food joint. 3 parked tightly along the way and one parked facing the street in an almost difficult manner. Would check to see if they're busy, but I came on a lunch hour and it wasn't so bad. 

Overall- Great experience. Would definitely recommend. Comfort food Japanese cravings and great service!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent cuisine but I'm not sure Yakisoba is worth $28.00 either way it was okay. This is good if you like modern decor and bouncy service."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal, the service was good, and overall I liked the soothing atmosphere of the restaurant. Music wasn't too loud and we went at a time when the restaurant wasn't super packed (Monday evening).

Please be CAREFUL. We ordered two Katsu dishes, takoyaki, and chicken thigh karaage. We were a party of two and found that just the katsu dishes along were GINORMOUS. We probably should have ordered just one to share. 

I ordered the Original Katsuya pork cutlet with cheese. That sauce is incredible. It was sweet, tangy, and very flavourful. They literally drenched my cutlet with this sauce which I was very welcome to. I also was served a side of rice and cabbage salad. My boyfriend got the Spicy Chili Katsu. I loved it as well. It had the right amount of spiciness. 

I wasn't too impressed with the takoyaki because it was made really large, and the outer
 coating was made of panko breadcrumbs. It made for an odd texture to the dish. The karaage wasn't anything special. I wish that they would have put more seasoning into it."}
{"text":"Crunchy tasty and definitely satisfying. The portions are huge though, I could only finish half of my meal before I surrendered to it. The side dishes were 6 dollars for 5 pieces of rich rich croquette which is a great price. Would come again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sat around noon, no wait and got a table really quickly. Server was nice ans attentive. Food was excellent. Sincw it was my first time, i got thr original sauce. Def better than the curry. Will come back again. Couple parking spots out in the front."}
{"text":"Had the carbonara double cheese pork katsu and omg it was soooo goood. It was creamy, cheesy and the meat was juicy but crispy on the outside. I've never had katsu like this before and I'm definitely going to come back!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Vegas for about two years now and Katsuya is by far my favorite sushi spot in the city. I have yet to have a roll that disappoints, and the cocktails are amazing. I would recommend specifics, but this is a rare gem where you can trust ANYTHING on the menu that looks appealing to you. Welcoming staff, especially Jose the bartender. Jose knows how to make some amazing specialty cocktails and is extremely personable. 

Pro tip: Visit between and 5pm and 7pm for an amazing happy hour menu, which includes some of their best speciality cocktails and sushi rolls at a fraction of their regular menu price."}
{"text":"Many different quality fish and kindly Sushi Chef try to promote all daily fresh products to guests (but not up sell type)"}
{"text":"We were looking to try Mr. Tonkatsu but realized that they had changed their name to Katsuya. I've never been to the old one but apparently it looks about the same. They re-vamped their menu and included a lot more selection of flavours and sauces. 

This place was fairly pricey at about $16+ CAD average for all of their meals. It came with refillable rice, miso soup and salad (something that was written at the end of of the menu!). It was nice this was available if you were still hungry since some of the sides were small. I ordered garlic spicy tonkatsu with cheese. It was quite yummy with the sauce and the crispy pork cutlet. The katsu also came in decent size. 

I would only go back once in a while but not something I could eat often. There is also limited parking if you intend to drive so we had to park on the streets."}
{"text":"By far the most amazing sushi I have ever had. Our server Jen provided fantastic service!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this katsu place for a while now & finally got around to trying it. I ordered the original Japanese pork katsu and my bf ordered the original pork katsu with cheese. The batter on the katsu is amazing very light and flaky. The pork was also very tender and the portion size is huge. I could only finish half of it and took the rest to go. I would definitely come again if I was craving katsu!"}
{"text":"Yay! They opened a location in mississauga, dont have to go all the way to North York/Toronto now. The same quality as the other locations. Very fresh and love how flaky the outside of the pork cutlet is. Definitely will come back when I'm craving some katsu."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites in Vegas! Ask for Stephan at the sushi bar - he introduced me to some of the best uni (sea urchin) and makes some fantastic rolls!"}
{"text":"Amazing crispy thick pork chops here. Unique sauce or traditional. Combo with a light side salad - great place if you feeling katsu."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! I am so glad Katsuya opened in Mississauga, didn't even know they were opening one until I stumbled upon the location here in yelp. First time my husband and I tried them was at their North York location and we were already impressed. The Mississauga location opened just 3 weeks ago. We came in around 10:15pm and everyone welcomed us with a smile. I love the interior of the restaurant, it is minimalist, a bit edgy yet sophisticated. Just not a big fan of the wooden chairs without backrests as they can get uncomfortable after sitting for a while but they have a few comfy bench seating, too. We were seated on one of the long tables at the end of the restaurant because there were 5 of us and the server came right away with the menus and water pitcher. We ordered the crab and cheese croquette and 1 lb curry karaage for apps, then 4 different types of tonkotsu: original with cheese, terimayo, garlic spicy katsu chicken and original fish katsu. All the food came fast, hot and tasty. We also got complimentary miso soup. There were a few items on the menu though that are not available to the location yet like the katsu salad. We love the generous amount of cabbage salad each plate came with and with just the right amount of white rice. The dressing for the cabbage is provided on the table and you can pour as much as you like. I go to try every one of our orders and everything tasted wonderful, the Katsu's are so tender. The katsu breading has just got the right amount of flaky bits to them and its not oily despite being deep fried. There are so much choices on the menu and the katsu is customizable ie, pork type: loin or tender, chicken or fish, sweet potato for their vegetarian option and even to add mozzarella cheese or cream cheese. I highly recommend their take wasabi as well, had it at their North York location and it's like a ceviche with octopus with wasabi dressing, we will try it here again next time we visit. We finished eating past 11pm and we did not feel rushed at all to leave. Prices are reasonable for the amount of serving you get. Can't wait to be back here and try their carbonara udon!"}
{"text":"Tried out their 5-7 pm happy hour at the bar, and It was decent.  Not sure I would pay regular price since the rolls were ok- good only.  The yellow tail with jalapeños happy hour and spicy edamame were probably their best dishes.   What gave them a great review was they had a bottle of Yamazaki 12 year old whisky!   Heaven in a bottle!   Overall, food came out quick and service was great.  4 solids stars!"}
{"text":"We ventured across the strip to try Katsuya's happy hour and it did not disappoint! As in all the other reviews, the tuna on crispy rice is worth getting, as well as the Sahana roll (which might be my favorite!) We had watermelon cucumber cocktail which was also refreshing. The one star off is because some of the dishes were a little too salty (brussel sprouts were served with bonito flakes; albacore with crispy onion). Service was also fantastic!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend last night at SLS and I have to say I love this place, every time Ive ate here the service and food is very consistent. Very fresh fish and delicious roles."}
{"text":"This place deserves the first place in the Katsu world. 
Always crispy, super fresh, and the thickness of the meat is just right. 
I have been here about 5-6 times now, and never disappoints!

First time I came here, they got my order wrong so I got Curry Katsu instead of Carbonara Katsu. They sincerely apologized and served me Carbonara although I told them it's really okay. (they let me keep Curry as well, which became my lunch next day lol) Curry was surprising tasty and I would get this again. 

However, Carbonara is my all-time-fav. If you like creamy sauce, you have to try it. Literally the best Katsu I had in my life! 
My husband always gets their Japanese Katsu, which comes with sesame seed that has to be grounded and mixd with the sauce. Simple and classic, yet tasty. 

Only downside is there's limited parking space. (about 4) But you can park on the side street in the residential area. 

Service is very friendly as well :) Can't wait for another visit to this gem."}

Like many of the Los Angeles offshoots within the SLS Hotel and Casino, Katsuya by Starck arrived to excited opening acclaim when the resort opened its doors just one year ago, and although time as well as legal troubles have led to a bit of negative press the restaurants themselves have continued to show well with trendy crowds and bumping EDM detracting only slightly from cuisine that fares far better than doubters may expect.

Admittedly known to the house, but ordering a la carte and treated to items no different to those served at tables around us, it was at a cozy booth decorated in katana and neon fans that our trio sat, and greeted by Chefs as well as a young server who proved above par for the course a ten-item sampler of signatures as well as a couple more eclectic items were ordered, the results ranging from truly excellent to surprisingly not bad.

No doubt a spot to be seen, the crowd well dressed and attractive with the sort of lighting and ambiance that intentionally screams 'cool,' the meal began with Japanese Beer alongside Sake and progressing to an atypical chawanmushi that saw custard atop black truffle mashed potatoes punched up with lobster there is little doubt the menu's high prices are at least in-part justified by the quality of ingredients, each bite utterly indulgent no matter how far from tradition it did stray.

Requesting the kitchen to roll out items at the Chef's discretion, plates two and three featured Katsuya's signature crab roll alongside rich pork gyoza interconnected by a flaky lattice, and although the former was indeed creamy and supple the crustacean itself seemed a touch muddled by semi-sweet sauce while the golden dumplings were a head-on assault on the senses, the thin shell breaking forth with juicy bekshire pig lent balance by a melange of herbs and spices.

Next offered an iced sashimi box along with a full order of tomago, suffice it to say that with exception of a few mispronunciations from the server everything spoke to quality fish sliced by a skilled hand, and with the half lobster arriving next given a whimsical 'walnut prawn' treatment the lightness of the batter almost seemed impossible, particularly when accounting for the fact that the flesh itself remained sweet, tender, and appropriately cooked just past raw.

Amused by the crunchy corn roll, an item selected almost entirely because it seemed destined to fail yet one that instead offered a complex flavor profile that saw discrepant ingredients each add something to the whole, savories concluded in a large bowl of wafu noodles steaming beneath a poached egg and tender bacon, the soy unfortunately pushing the salinity a bit past 'umami' and into the realm of outright salty, a shame as the noodles and bacon were each prepared quite well.

Unable to settle on just one dessert, the selection of sweets actually quite appealing compared to spots like Nobu or Koi, it was with two items served alongside a double espresso of LAMill over ice that the meal would end, and although the small tart of yuzu pudding on a buttery crust was a refreshing bite brightened by strawberries it simply couldn't compare to a creamy bread pudding given the 'baba au rhum' treatment by way of a pipette of booze, the addition of a honey tuille and rich vanilla ice cream adding complexity of temperature, texture, and taste.

Faring better than similarly branded swank sushi houses with a few standouts and the only real flaws in cuisine a result of too much sauce, Katsuya fulfills its role of offering tourists and club kids a good variety of light bites in a trendy setting while also providing high quality cuisine for more serious diners willing to look past the 'scene.'"}
{"text":"Tirso Cortez was our waiter and he was sooo amazing!! We came on Friday for the grand opening and had great service, then came back on Saturday and had the most amazing server!!!"}
{"text":"Loving their new menu! I got the carbonara tonkatsu. 
The pork is super tender And the outside is super crispy! 
Will def come back!"}
{"text":"It was a very delicious and filling experience at Katsuya downtown!

The service was good, and the portions are huge! My husband and I both ordered our own tonkatsu. I opted for their signature sauce with pork tender tonkatsu, and my husband ordered their cheese tonkatsu with chilli and garlic sauce.

You get unlimited miso soup, and they were quite decent tasting. The tonkatsu plate comes with shredded cabbage salad and rice. The salad dressing for the cabbage salad was tangy and delicious! The tonkatsu and cheese tonkatsu were both really good and tender. The batter for the tonkatsu is nice and light. 

We will definitely be back!! Perhaps we'll order one order to share next time. :)"}
{"text":"We finally got around to going to Katsuya on a Friday night, after I've been eyeing this place for so long! After our trip to Tokyo in December, I was craving tonkatsu. Katsuya did not disappoint!!

We arrived at around 7:30 pm, and there was a wait (not surprising). We wrote our names down and got called to our table ~30 minutes later, so the wait really wasn't too bad. The restaurant itself is quite small, but has a nice rustic decor. We sat at a communal table on little bar stools - not too comfortable, but it did the job for a quick meal. My one quip is that (I'm assuming) that Katsuya doesn't have a liquor license and doesn't serve booze. Their menu does have beer listed on it, with a \"coming soon\" sign next to it. This definitely isn't a huge deal for us, but it would have been nice to have a beer with my tonkatsu!

We ordered the cheese crab meat croquette ($6.00) to start. These were so delicious. There was a good amount of crab meat and cheese inside, and they were fried nice and crisp. They were served with some sort of honey mustard sauce on top and it was a really nice pairing. My husband ordered the Carbonara pork loin katsu set ($15.50) and I ordered the Katsuya original pork loin katsu ($12.50). The sets are served with refillable cabbage, rice and miso soup. The Carbonara absolutely STOLE the show. It's incredibly rich and filling, but so flavourful - the sauce has bacon, seafood and lots of cracked black pepper. I didn't love the Katsuya original sauce. It was a bit tangy, but next time I will get the original without sauce. I like the idea of sauce, but it makes the breading come off. Otherwise, the tonkatsu itself was excellent. The rice was perfectly cooked, and I loved the dressing for the cabbage. 

I can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Food is way over priced and basic to begin with. 
The place is empty for a reason- service is terrible. They forgot an order and so everyone ate at staggering times. The server glanced over quite often but was too afraid or something to come check on us or let us know food was coming. For an empty place their service should have been more attentive. 
The atmosphere and ambience is very cafeteria like as well, and it was freezing In there. Seemed like a half ass effort to bring a hip spot to the SLS."}
{"text":"Went there on a Wed and tried the social hour which was highly touted by fellow yelpers.  The food and environment was good but our whole experience was marred by our server.

Location: in SLS hotel inside the casino areas, easy to find
Ambience: new and contemporary and hip, music not too loud, good vibes, no complaints here.

Food/drinks: watermelon cucumber mojito was not bad, Hamachi kama was wonderful and was more than \"tapas\" size, the nigiri samplers, yellowtail sushi and Hamachi rolls were all descent, no complaints here.

Service: saw only one Asian lady behind the bar who took drink+ food orders.  After bringing our drinks, she never return once to check on us to see how we are doing, during our entire 45 min stay!!  This despite the fact that she walked by us multiple times and even chatted briefly with patrons in the next tables, WTH??  Based on her body language, I suspect she's one of those snobbish Asian ladies who found it beneath her to serve other Asian customers.  Au contraire, other servers who brought us food from the kitchen were pleasant and courteous enough.  

Price: $61 for 2 drinks and 4 \"appetizers\", not exactly cheap but reasonable for anything served inside a Vegas Casino

Conclusion:  social hour at Katsuya would have been a 4 star  experience if it wasn't for our \"inattentive\" server.  Would not return."}
{"text":"This is my go to katsu place. Very tasty very clean very polite customer service. I am highly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"I've visited this place twice and it was great both times. It's a small place with a modern woody look, with your typical izakaya square wooden stools, and industrial style light fixtures. I've only ever had their double cheese katsu, once with carbonara and the second time with the white snow spicy sauce. Their katsu entrees come with a side of miso soup, a small serving of rice, some pickled daikon, and a light cabbage slaw dressed with a fragrant sesame oil type vinaigrette (all refillable). Both the accompaniments I would say are necessary to cut through the richness that is their katsu slathered in sauce. The carbonara was creamy, with bacon and small shrimp and although ultimately not true to the carbonara name, was very delicious. The white snow option was my favourite, consisting of their house sauce (a medium-thin gravy with fruity and savoury notes) and shredded cheese. The katsu itself was well balanced; a crispy and rich exterior with a tender meat interior---it held together surprisingly well considering the layers of cheese incorporated on either side of the meat. The portions are more than generous and overall great value. Service was quick and friendly. I would say it's cheat-day worthy and as such, I hold Katsuya as the gold standard for katsu in the GTA."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at Katsuya twice during their Social Sundays.  Everything on their menu, except specialty sushi items was 50% off. Needless to say, after experiencing this culinary delight, I will never look at Japanese food the same way again. If you can dine here during this promotion, which I believe they have once or twice a month, then consider yourself blessed by the foodie Gods. Basically, you're getting the fine dining tasting experience --quality vs. quantity-- for a little over the price of mediocre local Japanese restaurants.

Ambiance: Katsuya is located at the end of the strip, inside of the new SLS casino. Bc it is a boutique establishment, restaurants here are  smaller than most on LV Blvd. However, what Katsuya lacks in size, it definitely makes up for in its seductive & intimate ambiance. Katsuya follows the upscale contemporary elegance theme very well. Upon walking into its open floor plan that overlooks the casino, you immediately feel the trendy city vibe right away. Most of its  decor is also more on the minimalistic side. Imagine neutral colors with bold accents, bright sofa pillows & large abstract paintings that make up the walls. The tbls also seat low to the ground w/ various combinations of booth, lounges & stools. The lighting is also not as dimmed as most places. You can definitely take decent pictures and read the menu w/o killing your eyes. Lastly, on a scale of 1-10, I'd rate the noise level a 7. Both times that I went here, the music playing in the background was either house or lounge music. IMO, it was perfect to set the mood. With that said, there is one flaw in its setting that I don't like: Their beverage bar. I've definitely seen bigger and nicer ones even in local places. IMO, Katsuya's bar doesn't have enough seating and it's also hidden on the far right side of the restaurant. Upon walking in, you're most likely to even miss it.

Service: The service here is excellent. However, there are times when the restuarant is so busy that the servers take longer than usual to tend to a tbl. Other than that, the front of house staffs is usually very accommodating. They'll recommend dishes and also explain each one as it is being dropped  

Favorite Dishes:
Crispy Brussels Sprouts - $13 Don't be fooled bc it's a vegetable! This is by far one of my favorite appetizers out there! Brussels sprouts come out in a bowl, deep fried and extremely crispy. It's also drizzled with a balsamic soy reduction that is slightly sweet to the taste and goes very well with the toasted almonds combined inside. Both of these ingredients compliments the slight bitterness of the Brussels sprouts perfectly. Overall, definitely one of those items that once you start eating, you can't stop because it's so addictive!

Mushroom Salad - $12 Mushroom lovers delight! This salad has a substantial amount of Japanese mushroom that I believe is sautéed in butter and some type of yuzu soy. It comes out slightly warm on top of a bed of butter lettuce. The combination of the two, warm and cool, is perfect in your mouth. If you're looking for a lighter appetizer for the palette, I'd recommend this item!

Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna - $18 Classic dish! Very beautiful presentation. Rice is squared, crispy but not hard. The tuna is also the perfect texture and amount of spice. Very fresh ingredients!

Wagyu and Foie Gras -$39 Absolutely amazing! If you're not a fan of fatty richness then I don't recommend. Waygu is beyond tender and juicy with a slight sweetness from the wine reduction. When combined with the buttery taste of Foie Gras. it's unbelievable! True to al la carte portions, they only serve 3 pieces in an order. However, it is the perfect amount because this item is extremely heavy on the palate.  Definitely good for sharing.

Wagyu Sliders - $14 Delicious dish. Wagyu has a delicious sweet teriyaki glaze that is served in traditional slider buns. It goes very well with the butter lettuce and creamy aioli sauce. Really wish there was a full size portion of this. It's another one of those items where once you start eating, you simply cannot stop. 

Braised Short Ribs - $31 RECOMMEND Best way to describe this dish is a Japanese version of southern comfort in your mouth. The meat is extremely tender and falls apart immediately when you put your fork through it. Also very generous portion. The wasabi mash potatoes have a pleasant kick to it. Really puts the \"Japanese\" taste to these short ribs. Presentation is also very beautiful. Meat is placed on top of the potato bed..Deep fried sugar glaze vegetable garnishes are also very good. The sweetness perfectly balances the wasabi potatoes' starchiness really well!

Miso Black Cod - $32 Yet another classic! Black cod is broiled perfectly with a deliciously sweet miso glaze. 

Seafood Yakisoba - $37 Very big portion with scallops, lobster, calamari and shrimp. Perfect combo of seafood and garlic chives. Very light as well, not salty at all. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the high reviews are about for this place on Yelp but after visiting it last night, it's definitely not as high as many people have rated in my opinion.  I ordered the spicy garlic pork loin Katsu.  It comes with unlimited miso soup and cabbage.  But don't be fooled, the miso soup was watery and not flavorful.  The cabbage dressing was so bland as well.

Now for the review on the pork loin.  If you have ever been to a proper tonkatsu restaurant, you probably noticed when they serve  you the fried meat, it was probably on a little cooling rack to keep its crispiness throughout your meal.  This place doesn't do that.  My pork loin was served directly on my dish and sauce was spooned a bit on top.  Of course by doing so, my pork loin got super soggy after a few minutes which affected the taste.  The batter became mushy and didn't have that crsipy crunch I was accustomed to when eating tonkatsu. The portion was pretty big which I  admit but the quality just wasn't there.  The sauce was spicy as advertised so if you can't handle the heat, better pass on they spicy katsu options.

Service was good and attentive which was nice.  The other downside was the parking.  There are so few spaces infront of the restaurant.  When all of the parking spots are full, there would be people waiting in their cars for a spot so even when  leaving your parking spot, it was a mission just trying not to swipe any cars to leave the small lot.  Would recommend parking somewhere nearby and walk over."}
{"text":"Not bad if your craving late night sushi . Service is decent , food very small portions."}
{"text":"I'm so conflicted. I love Katsuya. The atmosphere is so nice, the servers are nice. Everything is so yummy. My ABSOLUTE favourite thing to get are the crab croquettes. They're so great when they are fresh. 

The serving size is crazy big. I've been to the Katsuya on Yonge and have been to this one a couple of times and have never managed to finish my meal. As a filipino, the unlimited rice is also my weakness. You're definitely getting your money's worth when you come to Katsuya.

But the last time I visited, I found a hair inside my katsu. The server was nice enough to not charge me for the carbonara katsu that I ordered but I just can't get the memory of taking a bite out of my katsu and finding that short curly hair in the batter of my katsu out of my head. :("}
{"text":"Very fresh!  I ordered the sashimi dinner and it was a nice portion for dinner.  Everything was fresh.  The Brussels sprout appetizer was to die for.  Very crispy with a sweet sauce.  Our server was very helpful with our selections and attentive to our needs.  We are at the sushi bar and the conversation with the chef was amazing and informative."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to try a sample of their Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna and the Baked Crab Hand Roll. Both were super fresh no hint of fishy taste or smell. The Spicy Tuna didn't have an over powering heat like a lot of them do, it was just enough to be able to taste everything and hide nothing.
Staff was excellent. I'd love to give it another try.
The back private room, perfect for a group was very cool with the giant dragon tattoo surrounding us on every wall."}
{"text":"Shocking. It just got worse and worse. When I eat sushi I expect it to taste fresh and not fishy I expect the service to be on par at least with the prices that are being charged.
I
Not recommended whatsoever.

I could go on and on all the obvious mistakes starting with Nobu hack recipe (which was botched) yellowtail jalapeño to the shrimp tempura which was soggy and cooked in old oil."}
{"text":"Now, this place can roll some quality sushi. There might be another place or two in Vegas that will be able to compete, but not many. These guys take sushi and service serious, and believe me I love them for it. Quality at a decent price. I have paid more for sushi in Vegas, but Katsuya stands out. I am already looking forward to my next visit, and as long as they keep it up I will be back. My Yelp bros and sisters will keep me updated)))) 
By the way, drinks are good as well!!!"}
{"text":"Dustin our server ROCKED!!! The food was amazing and the service was even better! It's a complete 5 Star experience.....Don't miss an opportunity to eat an amazingly delicious meal and dine with Dustin the Rockstar!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Katsuya last night for date night and also to try out Social Sundays. Well, as always it was pretty amazing! We made reservations on open table for 8pm, when we arrived our table wasn't ready so we had to wait until a little after 8:30, which was slightly annoying but no big deal. I was pleasantly surprised that just about everything on the menu including drinks, was included on the 50% off deal. We had Baked Crab Hand Rolls (twice) which were amazing as always, the Crispy Spicy Tuna is usually my favorite menu item at Katsuya but this time it came out completely cold so that was disappointing. The Yellowtail Jalapeno Sashimi appetizer was very light. The Lobster Roll was one of the most delicious sushi rolls I have ever tasted, and I consider myself a connoisseur, it had so many incredible flavors. The Corn Crunch Roll also had great flavor, but took a while to come out and tasted like it had been sitting for a while, but it was still decent. Finally the Chocolate Cake with Coconut Ice Cream was pretty good, it could have been a bit more moist and I could have done without the tapioca that didn't add to the dish. All of that plus a glass of Cab and our bill was only $76! Of course we tipped on the pre-discounted amount, but it was still a great deal! We will definitely be going back the next time they do #SocialSundays"}
{"text":"I came here at 4pm and there was no one here. I ordered the terri mayo pork loin katsu and crab meat croquette. I did not expect the katsu to be so big. I am a big eater but I could not finish both of this and my sister could not either. Service was exceptional as the server kept coming to our table to check up on us, I counted 4 times to be exact. This location is literally next to Ryerson (you can see Kerr Hall outside the window). There are arrows to help lost foodies navigate their way to the restaurant! Highly recommend and I will come back to try the other katsu platters!

Terri mayo pork katsu - dang I did not expect this to be so good! As a fan of takoyaki, I was excited to try this platter. I was opting to get the original sauce katsu but when I saw that, I wanted to try it right away. The bonito flakes were a win and that it fit very well with the mayo and pork. There was a bottle of some sort of vinaigrette on the table and the waitress told me that you put that on the cabbage portion of the platter.

Crab meat croquette - 5 relatively larges pieces with mayo on top. It had crab meat (of course!), potato and I think cheese in the center. The coating of this appetizer was on a whole other level - hot, very crispy and flaky!

P.S. the washrooms are so clean!"}
{"text":"First time here. Greated by friendly host. Restaurant was packed on a Sunday evening. Nice ambiance with some cool wooden artwork on the wall. They had a TV on the wall playing anime. Lots of katsu choices of pork, chicken, fish. A variety of choices for sauces from original, garlic, spicy. Creamy Udon was sooo good too! Not sure how their washroom is, but my female friend who usually complains about dirty washrooms, didn't make any comments about it. Didn't score perfect because very limited parking and they also don't accept credit card. Cash or Debit clearly stated on their entrance. Otherwise delicious food and good overall experience."}
{"text":"Went with the GF. Got the original tonkatsu pork loin and tender. DELICIOUS! Great service, FRIENDLY and PROFESSIONAL staff, unlimited servings of sides - miso soup etc. One drawback, cabbage side was plain tasting. Other then that, would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Jessica (The lovely manager)  and Jennifer thank you for the most incredible 1 year anniversary dinner. My husband and I had such an incredible time. The food and service was amazing to say the least! Will definitely be back soon!  Please ask for Jennifer if you dine in. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten anything like this but I'm glad I tried it. The place looked packed but we managed to fit in without a reservation. Me and my friend ordered variations on the sweet chili katsu with chicken and were both happy. Breaded chicken with rice and cabbage (the sauce is a must) were combined a win. Plus they refill rice, cabbage, and miso soup as much as you want! 

I wouldn't come here for a business dinner or to get drinks, but I would come back for this unique dining experience."}
{"text":"Glad to see another katsuya open in downtown. I've been to north York location and was impressed with food and the food downtown location was also great. Their pork cutlets come in generous portion and meat is very soft and juicy. The breading outside is crunchy too. I also tried their fish cutlet and the tartar sauce had a good balance of lemon and mayo. Service is friendly and they come around few times to check on us."}
{"text":"Got the wagyu ribeye... disappointed :( It wasn't as tender as I had hoped, more chewy and way too over-seasoned. Expensive. Just meh. 

Serves me right for going to a sushi place in Vegas."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I had been to the Katsuya in Brentwood before, and while all these Japanese restaurants seem the same to me (Katsuya, Nobu, Sushi Samba, Social House, etc.) and are pricey for having such small portions, I keep coming back to them anyway :p  Each restaurant either has some kind of stand-out dish or ambiance nice enough to make me want to come back.  

For Katsuya, the stand-out dish is their Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna - it is a MUST!  Other than that, we got items that you usually can't go wrong with and they did not go wrong: Creamy Rock Shrimp, Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, Miso-Marinated Black Cod, and mochi for dessert.  Actually, I had never had mochi before so I had nothing to compare theirs to, but it was ok - nothing all that special.  

Service started out pretty good but started to slack off a bit.  For instance, the mochi my sister and I ordered never came out  - I think they had lost the ticket for it or something.  Meanwhile, our friend was done with her meal and dessert long before they finally ended up bringing us our mochi.  Our server though apologized and made up for it by taking it off our bill.  Also a nice touch was the rock shrimp being on the house - I heard the person who brought it out say something about it being a special for locals, and our friend we dined with is a local.  

We got seated at a booth which we requested when I made the reservation.  It was pretty full on the Sunday night we went.  Our reservation was for 8pm, and it stayed busy until closing.  It's a trendy place, and the later crowd seemed to be in their clubbing best :p

By the way, did I already mention how good their Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna is?  Hehe :)"}
{"text":"I went to Katusuya with my co-workers and we had a great experience. Service was bright and energetic, but not over the top. Our waiter Brian suggested a great sake that paired well with everything. Sushi was creative and delicious. The Cucumber salad was fresh crisp and perfectly seasoned. Was worth walking through the casino for dinner."}
{"text":"I tried the Original Pork Tender Tonkatsu and the Lion Pork Tonkatsu and both was really disappointed. It taste so basic for being a Tonkatsu restaurant. You should definitely try Mr. Tonkatsu on bloor street it is way better 10/10 (:"}
{"text":"Similar to the uptown location, this location provides a good selection of Katsu. Pork is the original, but of course if you're feeling adventurous they have many different meats and sauces to complement! 

The karaage (side app) is what you would expect but the star of the show is the pork! I would recommend to get your sauce on the side to maximize crispness. You can ask for more miso soup and rice. It's comparable to Mr Tonkatsu for less. 

All in all, it brings me back to Japan and is good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Had a delicious birthday dinner here. Probably the best meal I've had, drinks included.

Highlights were the rock shrimp, tiger roll, and spicy tuna on crispy rice. My Riesling was delicious, too.

Our server was friendly, the food came out quickly, and in comparison to other sushi restaurants on LVB... our total check with 7-8ish items and three drinks was about $215. Pretty cheap in comparison to other Katsuya locations or places like SushiSamba, etc.

10/10."}
{"text":"Ate here with friends. Nice location. Super friendly staff. Food pretty good. Restaurant extremely clean. I like it."}
{"text":"So happy that I made it to Katsuya last night for happy hour. The food, drinks and service was 5 star. I enjoyed the watermelon mojito as well as some of katsuya's top dishes that were on the happy hour menu. Between my daughters and I, we had the yellowtail with jalapeño, the crispy rice with spicy tuna, California rolls, the brussel sprouts and the fried chicken. All were excellent. We also took the advice of our server and ordered the bread pudding for dessert which was a great recommendation. The service was excellent as well- the manger Jesus even came over to make sure we were satisfied and enjoyed our meal. I would not hesitate to recommend Katsuya for its sushi and atmosphere. I will definitely make it a must do anytime I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dinner we had.  The sushi was amazing.  We tried the A4 Fried rice and it was amazing but expensive.  The service was perfect.  The attention the server have us was what you would want.  The pacing of the meal was great too.  Not everything came out at once.  It was well paced.  The only item I did not like was the meat on my Wagyu Tobanyaki.  It wasn't tasty and for the price, there was very little meat.  The mushrooms were better than the meat.  We would go back,  I highly recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"Great, affordable sushi. 
Located in the SLS, the restaurant is pretty spacious and carries a very nice ambience. From the host to the servers, everyone was kind and offered great service! They are very accommodating as my boyfriend and I showed up there at 7pm with no reservation. Understanding that we were on a date, the host gave us options to either sit us right away at a loud table in the middle of other tables or wait for a more private area to open up. We opted to wait and they let us sit at a table for the time being, offered us water and gave us the menu to look at as we waited. Very accommodating! 

As for food, they offer plenty of options. From rolls to sashimi and plenty more, the menu seems endless! Our food came out quick and tasted so fresh! The blue crab handrolls are a MUST try. 
I think that this is one of the better restaurants located in the SLS, so give it a try!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. The major problem we had was we sat at the bar and the service was the worst service we have ever had. And we eat out a lot and have worked in the service industry in the past. It was actually quite awkward and we could not wait to get out of there. The bartenders were gossiping most of the time and the one with the short blonde hair that was serving us stood there and watched us eat but did not talk to us. Very strange and uncomfortable. We normally enjoy sitting at the bar in restaurants but I would say avoid it here. Someone is not managing the bar properly for something like this to happen."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but the service was so good! I had high expectations for the food and it definitely met that. The katsu was huge and well cooked!"}
{"text":"This place is totally cool the good is top notch and the service is close to it. I have been several times and will continue to make the drive from Henderson"}
{"text":"Deep Fried Goodness+Happy Waitress with Smiley Faces+Huge Piece of Pork = Super Happy Me

Spicy Cheese Pork Tonkatsu. I love spicy so that's the way to go. If you want to have a cheese pull, maybe a double cheese one would be better for the perfect photo?

The breading just so crispy and the pork juicy and tender. I would have at the whole thing by myself but it is also good to share with your friend. 

There are so many different sauce option so I would be trying something different every time."}
{"text":"I ate here this past week and was totally blown away. Started with OToro, Chu Toro and Blue Fin tuna. Couldn't believe the quality of this fish!!  Had to try the Wagyu Sashimi, Wagyu Ribeye and Filet w/ fois...delicious as well. My friends had some awesome cocktails but I suck to Cakebread.  Though I did have an Old Fashioned and finished with cognac. I'm pretty specific (pain in the butt) but my server Ashley took great care of my friends and I. If you're in Vegas and want sushi do yourself a favor, go to Katsuya at the sls!!!  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Solid B-.... for social hour faire that is. 

When we asked for what was super fresh, they recommended the blue fin toro. It delivered - melt in your mouth goodness. It redeemed some of the other items. 

I LOVE yellowtail & anything sashimi so we ordered that off the social hour menu. Both my husband & I had a bad piece. Being regular sushi eaters- THESE THINGS HAPPEN! No biggie and they handled it well. Took away the fish & deducted it from our order. Thank you!

The edamame and shishito peppers were huge portions which was great so delicious we arrived hungry. The rainbow roll was shockingly good- my riceless self deconstructed it and devoured them. Our server recommended the baked crab hand roll which we had high expectations for but it fell short. It was a small portion and just didn't wow. 

Likewise for the tuna sashimi with crispy onion on happy hour. It wasn't bad but it wasn't necessarily good- it was edible.

I think it was my err honestly. We've always had amazing sushi in Vegas and have come to expect such- happy hour or not. But here, I think your best bet is to ask the Sushi chefs what's fresh and just order from the full price menu unless you prefer rolls. 
Needless to say lesson learned. I think we'll be back if we stay at SLS or W again but i don't think we'll return for social hour, unless it's just for the peppers and edamame."}
{"text":"Prior to dining, my only familiarity with the Katsuya name was from TMZ.  If I were making half a milly per TV episode, this would be in my regular dining rotation too!  The menu's prices are on par with Nobu, Sushi Roku or Blue Ribbon.  

At least those restaurants offer some kind of a chic atmosphere.  Katsuya felt like an upscale diner with a sushi bar plunked in the middle.  The bright lighting, noise from the casino and the constant yelling of \"Irashaimase!\" over and over and over by employees made this a decisively unsexy spot.  I can't imagine tourists would want this kind of setting for a pricey sushi meal on the strip.  If a booth at Nobu's outpost at Caesars Palace is Kate Upton, it's kind of Rosie O'Donnell here.  Power lunches or corporate dinners? Yes.  Anniversary dinners or bachelorette parties? No!  

For those reasons, my wife and I chose to sit at the bar since the people working there looked like they were having a good time.  All them were super nice and knowledgeable of all things Katsuya. They also made some awesome cocktails to boot.  I loved the \"Sahara Cooler\" which consisted of Ketel One Oranje vodka, Aperol, passion-fruit purée, fresh lime juice, and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit beer.  That was instant refreshment.  One of the bartenders, whose name escapes me but I remember being a Chargers/Eagles fan, created a wonderful version of a prickly pear cocktail for my wife. 

The plan was to not order items we could get at local, off the strip Japanese spots like Kyara or Raku.  So $8 edamame (shockingly saw lots of people order this), anything from the robata grill ($12 for asparagus with no bacon) and $11 karaage were out of the question.  

Want to know what was?  Rare Wagyu filet with foie gras on top!  So tender and soooo decadent, it was like a story I never wanted to end.  The plum wine sauce reduction really added a nice balance.  Lobster and truffle chawanmushi was another dish I don't see everyday.  Despite the small portion being steamed in a Japanese tea cup, I thought it tasted great and would probably order it again.  Dig in from the bottom for maximum truffle taste.

I thought the Wagyu sashimi seared with hot oil and topped with chives and ginger was very good too.  The oil they used made it taste more like a Chinese dish which was a nice little changeup from the other beef dish.  Seared tuna with Japanese salsa was equally as good.  The high quality of the fish was easy to see as well as taste.

My wife was still hungry and had her eye on the \"Wafu Carbonara\" which was simply described as \"slow-cooked bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg\".  I tried to talk her out of it since she makes a great version of this dish at home.  Unsurprisingly, I lost that battle.  One of the bartenders assured us this was something worth having and she was right.  The huge chunks of pork belly with bonito flakes and sauce/egg mix just oozing over the ramen noodles was a hearty dish and a nice ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Katsu Restaurants in town!
Upon entering we were impressed by the interior design and we really liked the vintage vibe it gave off. Fortunately it wasn't too busy so we were seated right away and were served water and Miso Soup. They offer \"unlimited\" miso soups so you can get refills if you're super hungry and/or your order is taking to long. Also, who doesn't like miso soup (especially with the terrible cold weather we've been having recently).

We ordered one Cheese Carbonara Katsu and one Chicken Terri Mayo. The Carbonara was pork and I tried a piece but it was a little too heavy for me with the cream and all the extra ingredients that were added on. Don't get me wrong, it was still super delicious and it is one their most popular dishes. 

The Chicken Terri Mayo was my dish and I was extremely happy with it. I just love chicken and mayo soooo much so that dish was literally heavenly. The chicken was solid and cooked well, the Teriyaki Sauce was a great addition to overall taste and it was just the right amount (not too much/too little).

Been seeing some great reviews on their crab croquettes and I will be sure to come back and give it a try :)"}
{"text":"I just got back from being in Las Vegas for my birthday and let me just say that Katsuya delivered! My friends and I were looking for a restaurant inside the SLS Hotel. I wanted a steak and my friends wanted sushi. I was hesitant to go to Katsuya because it is a sushi bar and not a steak house but since I was the only one who wanted steak I told them I would try out the Katsuya rib eye. And so I did! The rib eye steak was beyond good - it was perfection! Everyone must try this meat out. Only downside is the long wait, my advice is to order a small appetizer beaches it will take a while for the steak to be out. Nevertheless amazing food!"}
{"text":"Although the sushi was fabulous the noise level was ear splitting, the service was non existent,  and for that service they added an automatic 20% gratuity. Disappointing birthday dinner."}
{"text":"I've already been to katsuya a handful of times and every visit it has been on point. the breading, the meat, the sauces, the sides are all excellent. The service is extremely friendly. It's become a monthly ritual when my katsu craving comes around! Personal favourites include the carbonara udon and the katsu with spicy sauce."}
{"text":"Second time visiting this place for lunch. I ordered a carbonara katsu. It is slightly spice which is not very typical for a carbonara sauce but I think it is a very good balance for katsu and rice. The portion is on pretty big side. I cant even finish all the pork and rice.

My friends ordered the crab meat crochette to share and that was good too!

Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"It's my first time visiting Katsuya. I have visited this location under another name. Food is very good and portion size is very generous, especially the soup, rice and salad is bottomless. Service is great as servers were attentive and they often come to make sure things are ok. So bring an empty stomach and come enjoy some great katsu!"}
{"text":"This place is overall great. The staff is friendly and fast. The atmosphere is very nice and calm. Its a small restaurant and it was fairly busy but wasnt too loud or chaotic. Very cool place. 

I had the karaage appetizer (the thigh) and the curry katsu chicken meal. All the meals come with cabbage and miso. They also offer free refills on the miso and cabbage. I think drinks are included in that but im not too sure. It wasnt too expensive for the amount of food they give, i even brought some to-go. 

There curry is really good, but the one thing that made me 5 star it other than there amazing katsu, was there delicious miso soup, out of all the places i have been in brampton, it was worth the drive, cause they have the best. Really great restaurant and recommend you try it! 

Also minimal parking probably 7 or 8 spots as it is a really small place"}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner and service. WE drank the cucumber and watermelon mojitos which were light and not too sweet and very delicious. We shared the fois gras Waygu beef, crispy brussel sprouts (SOOO good), the black cod in miso, Lobster Truffle (in the starters), The katsuya Ceviche, Wagyu sashimi, and the Katsuya roll. All of the dishes were amazing. I could not pick a favorite one. I was very impressed by the Brussel Sprouts because I usually dislike brussel sprouts. The black cod in Miso is also just amazing, but nothing disappointed. Very fresh and light tasting. Service was spot on. VERY VERY GOOD ALL AROUND."}
{"text":"I will give 10star to PETER  for such a great service that he offered...very polite and professional. You have to hire more people like this guy for you to have a long life in this kind if business... hope to see more people like you peter..."}
{"text":"Very good Katsuya! I had the garlic and chili one on tender pork. Very large portions with endless supply of miso soup. Shaved cabbage was good and fresh. The fried oysters were meh. Very hip decor."}
{"text":"We got taken care of....PROPER! Amazing presentation and fresh as it comes. Stephan is definitely a master of his craft. We went for a bachelor party and the staff made it their priority to make sure our dinner was to our ridiculously high standards (we're elitists) and they delivered. Stephan took care of our needs in every way and we pretty much walked away fully satisfied. Y'all won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have to say this place simply amazing! Definitely a must try with the best Katsu in town! Katsuya never fails to impress my taste buds and satisfy my belly with their delicious and tender Katsu. It is located in a small plaza just north of Yonge and cummer. Parking is very limited and I would suggest avoiding peak hours as seating inside the restaurant is also limited. 

I usually get the sweet chili katsu. The sauce is amazing and very delicious with the righr amount of sweetness, garlic flavor and spiceness. The katsu itself is super tender and the coating is nice an crispy. It comes with a serving of rice and salad which are unlimited refills. Although most of the time refills will not be needed as the size of the katsu itself is huge! The price is around $13-15 depending on which type you order which is really worth the money for the portion and quality you are getting. Service is good and the staff are usually friendly and are very accomodating."}
{"text":"Located at the back of the SLS Hotel lobby it's small but mighty! The ambience is really just open to the casino floor, so it does not give a vibe of being in a restaurant which I really did not care for, however the sushi is really an experience. My group ordered another plate of the double hamachi roll as well as the gyoza and karaage chicken. If you want a more full restaurant experience, I would suggest Nobu but a quick authentic sushi experience visit Katsuya!"}
{"text":"Our faves? The regular Japanese curry with chicken cutlet and their honey butter powder french fries were really good. We also had the crab meat and cheese balls which were really tasty and we also ordered a pork tender cutlet and asked them to give us half/half sauce of original house + sweet chili. I wasn't a huge fan of the original house/sweet chili (same base as original) cus the flavours were just a little... Off for me? I can't even describe it, but their regular Japanese was a good solid sweet curry. Good joint for Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Happy hour here is good, and priced right. Otherwise, it is way too expensive, and not justified. The sushi rolls and nigiri were fresh. Not outstanding rainbow roll, but quite nice. Baked crab rolls were delicious though! Good sake, cheerful service. Considering it is Vegas, and can be hit or miss, quite enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food was amazing. For anyone looking for a premium sushi place to go this is it. 

Ask for Emily Phuong!!!!!!!  PHENOMENAL SERVER"}
{"text":"I'll give this place 3.5/5 because tbh Kaiju is more or less the same in terms of flavour but this is more of a sit down place which is why there is a price premium. I checked in on Yelp and got a free pop (bless). We stuck with the Katsuya katsu's (I got pork loin, my friend got the fish). Both were very nicely breaded and crispy without being too oily. The miso soup is free and free flowing. The katsu came with some cabbage and rice. Portions are a good size, ambiance is nice. It's a small restaurant and there is some communal seating."}
{"text":"I got the Katsu burger which was pretty good. I'd say it's a much better deal than the regular tokatsu dishes which are much pricier. It's a bit smaller of course but still the portion is huge for one person. I just removed the buns because I felt it tastes better without them. We also ordered the good chili tokatsu which was good too. Both were good but not outstanding.

The standout was the takoyaki. It was one of the best I've ever had. I also never seen panko style crumbs used on takoyaki so it was a bit unique too. We also got to try the the shrimp appetizer with tartar sauce. That was also good too.

Service was a bit hectic."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best katsus I've had locally. Lots of great flavors and the portions were very generous. Only complaint I have is their rice. They did not inform us that they don't offer white rice. Which unfortunately 90% of our party didn't eat any other types of rice other than white rice. But will definitely return."}
{"text":"Teriyaki mayo cheese. My friends ordered garlic chilli, carbonara, spicy chilli - but I liked mine the best . Cozy inside and I'm gonna try the other katsu and crab croquette next time! The other photo attached is crispy chicken with 3 different sauces: Teri yaki, wasabi mayo, sweet chilli. I liked the sweet chilli sauce the best. I hope they put some greens in salad thou."}
{"text":"Katsuya restaurant offers a great dinner menu for restaurant week with 4 courses at $50/person and the portions are all very generous; our server are very nice and professional. The food was very good, the chicken salad got me, it's a bomb."}
{"text":"Just dined at Katsuya, and we felt while it was not excellent, it was very good.  First, while the food is unque, the flavors are really not outstanding, say on a par with Nobu, but then, neither are the prices.  We sampled a few appetizers, a few rolls, and an entree.  All very good.

Service was prompt, althought the server, while friendly and attentive, spoke very quickly, and we had trouble understanding her for that reason.

I was very glad a came, and I would visit again."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Thursday night and had a good experience but, I didn't think this restaurant lived up to all the hype. 

When we arrived (at around 6:30PM), the restaurant wasn't too busy and still wasn't busy by the time we left. The staff are friendly and helpful and the menu that they offer is pretty self-explanatory.

To start, we ordered chicken karaage, which came with a spicy mayo and pickled radish. The karaage was crunchy on the outside while still being moist on the inside. The pieces of chicken were also large enough to be a satisfying bite! The meat was flavorful and also paired really well with the spicy mayo. Another thing to note: we were not offered unlimited miso soup and cabbage salad which is a common mention on this yelp page (maybe they missed us, maybe it's no longer offered. not sure)

For the main course, I ordered the pork tenders katsu in traditional Japanese style. This came with a side of cabbage salad, a dipping sauce, sesame seeds and rice making for a dish that was a pretty hefty meal. I'll start with the main part of the show: the katsu. It was not too bready and satisfyingly crunchy however, the meat was a bit bland. This was improved by the dipping sauce and sesame seeds that you could roll onto the meat. The cabbage salad was just made of finely shredded cabbage leaves with an Asian style vinaigrette dressing. Even with the dressing, this salad was also pretty forgettable but served well to lighten the heaviness of the dish.

Overall, a decent experience at Katsuya. Would be open to the idea of going back to try some of the other styles of katsu that they offer."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Carbonara Cheese Katsu\". The source is rich and creamy, with lots of little toppings like broccoli, prawns and squid! This is my only choice among the various choices of katsu in the menu! LOVE IT"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and the cheese inside is so melty and gooey. The place is a little small so it can be difficult to find seating for a larger group. Also very little parking. But the food is amazing so you still have to try"}
{"text":"Best pork cutlet I ever had, the line was long but we got seated pretty quickly considered we checked in on a busy day. Best part is that there's cheese inside the katsu plus unlimited refill on rice"}
{"text":"Loveeeee Katusya! Living in the neighborhood, it's one of my favorite places to go for happy hour! Every time I go service and food are spot on. Hostess greets with a smile, but I like to sit at the bar. Alice takes care of me, she's so sweet and makes a bomb jasmine margarita. Favorites are the crispy Brussel sprouts, lobster dynamite, spicy albacore with crispy onions, and creamy rock shrimp. My roommate raves about the Sahara roll and wagyu sashimi. Being in the service industry, I can appreciate that there was a blonde manager always on the floor who came around and filled up our water when Alice got busy and asked how everything was.  As a local I come back because it's always delicious and consistent, definitely my favorite place in SLS."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because the reviews were really good. So I did and I have no idea why it's 4.5 stars. This place is mediocre at best. Mr tonkostu was actually quite a bit better. I tried the katsu dish with the sweet fruit sauce and it was just okay. I was underwhelmed, it was generally average. I wouldn't go back because there's much better places to go to in Toronto."}
{"text":"Being a newly opened restaurant, it's service is exceptional, just that the server forgot about our miso soup. Large portions of food, if you are not suoer hungry you might want to share the main with someone. The breading of their katsu was excellent, and it comes with a fresh Japanese-style salad. The dressing is the key to the salad, without it it's basicslly a normal cole slaw that you can get at the supermarket. The atmosphere was living, but there were not enough hangers for coats and jackets. Overall it is quite a perfect experience. I will give it a 8.8/10."}
{"text":"Happy Hour menu is amazing here. When in town, I always come in for a early dinner. HH is daily from 5-7pm. You can't beat the half off price for drinks and sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Coming from a guy who has dined a few times at their other location back in Hollywood and also someone who eats sushi at least twice per week all around Los Angeles, I can tell you with certainty that the fish quality here was shameful and tarnishes the Katsuya brand. I personally can't remember the last time I had albacore as dubious as what was served to me here over the weekend, which probably gives you a good idea of how my other sashimi tasted!  I'm not sure if this place is just struggling and saves there's fish way too long, or if the management just isn't running this establishment properly -- Either way, I'll be sure not to overpay for sushi this awful ever again in Vegas. 
Frankly, the best part about this restaurant is the ambiance. The service was ok, and you already know how I feel about the fish... Do yourself a favor and don't waste a journey off the strip to this gift-wrapped gross sushi bar. 
PS: I really don't like writing reviews like this, which is why I mostly write about positive experiences (see my profile). My hopes are that I save fellow sushi lovers like me from a wrecked palate."}
{"text":"The food was really good. It was really flavourful. Service was nice. Place is clean and quiet. Very authentic-like feeling. Only gave a 4 star because they had no chicken left :( will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Spicy tuna crispy rice are my favorite. Also love the rock shrimp and crab hand rolls! Happy hour is the way to go here. Hard to believe its not busier but I guess its little off the main drag."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here while on a staycation. Looks pricey, but very affordable happy hour from 5-7 nightly. 
Ordered 3 rolls and an order of edamame. The serving of edamame was huge! Only $4 at happy hour. California roll was $5, spicy tuna roll was $7, and rainbow roll was $10. Such a deal at an upscale establishment! Definitely going back for a sushi fix!"}
{"text":"You should go to Katsuya - NOW.

A large group of us dined their for my birthday a couple of weeks ago.  I am not a huge sushi eater, but there are a few things I know that I enjoy - I chose this place because I knew that everyone else would really love it. Well, as it turns out, I also really enjoyed it.

I can't even tell you all about everything we had - but here were some of the highlights:

Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno: I've had this before, but it's one of my all-time favorites. So light and fresh.

Crispy Brussel Sprouts: I normally do not like this veggie at all, but holy crap were these amazing!! I have been dreaming about them ever since and can't stop telling everyone how delicious they were.

Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna: Not my favorite, but well done. I was confused as to whether it should be one bite or not - one bite is not a good idea, for future reference. Haha.

Katsuya Ceviche: Also really good. I am not normally a fish fan, but for some reason I love sashimi quality stuff. This was so fresh and the flavors were awesome!

Creamy Rock Shrimp: Another favorite of mine. Creamy and crunchy and spicy all at the same time. Yum.

Cucumber Sunomono: A pleasant surprise. I love cucumbers, and these were tasty.

We had so much food that I honestly don't remember everything we had. Everything is really well done and delicious and we were all so full and happy after dinner!

They make wonderful signature cocktails and have a good list of Japanese beers (and of course sake).  The vibe in the restaurant is young and hip and it's a great place to go before heading out for a night of gambling or clubbing. The service was amazing - fast, friendly and efficient.

Best part - they are currently offering a LIving Social deal - dinner for 2 for $99. Trust me, that's a great deal and you should do it - NOW!"}
{"text":"Great service & great food !
I would come back here anytime
The pics say it all :)

The portion was actually really big i couldn't finish it all. The seatings are not that flexible so I wouldn't recommend to groups more than 4 though."}
{"text":"I'll preface this review with the fact that I went in very hungry.  

The menu contains many different types of meat and sauce katsu combinations.  My wife and I ordered the original double cheese katsu, the original pork loin katsu, and cheese crab croquettes.  The miso arrived first, and I enjoyed it a lot.  It didn't have the same seaweedy taste that usually accompanies miso.  

Next to arrive was the croquettes.  They were AMAZING!  The tartar sauce was delicious as was the rest of the croquette.  Also, they were quite large.  After eating both the miso and the croquettes, I was very excited to try the katsu.

That's where there was a bit of a let-down.  The sauce wasn't what I was expecting.  It had a fairly strong cinnamon or nutmeg flavour to it that I felt threw off the taste of the katsu.  Both my wife and I agreed that something tasted a bit off for our tastes.  It wasn't bad, just...different.

The staff were friendly, and the atmosphere was nice.  It has a very open kitchen concept that allows you to see exactly what is happening with your food.  It was full when we arrived, but luckily there's a TV in the waiting area (which was showing Dragonball Z - not sure if it's a TV station or what.)

Overall, we had a pleasant experience and the food was good enough to warrant going back to try a different sauce for the katsu next time."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of katsu (mainly chicken) and my cousin who's the total opposite tried out this place and loved it so she suggested for me to try it out. I went here on a Saturday evening around 6pm and I thought it would be really busy but there was no line up and a lot of seats available. I really liked the interior decor of the place, had a nice ambiance to it. We were seated promptly and it didn't take long for us to decide what we wanted. I came with a part of 4 and we've never tried this place before so we all got pork katsu. I actually wanted chicken katsu so I could compare it to another katsu joint but I completely missed it on the menu!! I really wanted to try the one with cheese in it but it was only avail for pork so I didn't even notice the chicken to the left of the menu list. 

If you check in on Yelp here, you get a free soft drink of your choice. 

The katsu generally was really good and the portions are HUGE. So if you're super hungry then this place is for you. One katsu had about maybe 8 pieces to it? I only ate 3-4 and I packed the rest home. They curry sauce was very typical so nothing special here but I liked the taste of it. I ordered the katsu with cheese in it and when each piece was pulled apart, you can see the cheese ooze out. The cheese was good, but it was a little bit heavy and too much imo. I wouldn't get double cheese (that is an option on menu) unless you love cheese THAT much.

The plate also came with some rice and a salad. The salad sauce was on the table already and the waitress shakes it for you. General stuff here.

This place is expensive for lunch but not bad for dinner. You'll probably have to pack it to go because portions are so big. I toasted it in the oven the day after and it still tasted pretty good and crispy! I spent about $20-22 all in with tax and tips but the portions make up for the price and I'm okay with that!

I would def come back again to try the other katsus!!"}
{"text":"First time at Katsuya and it was a really good experience! There was a small wait, but we got in fairly quick. The interior was really nice and cozy, it was clean and the servers were friendly. They had a mix of English and Korean music which was nice to listen to. 

I ordered the original cheese filled katsu. The sauce was light and sweet, and paired well with the crispy, deep fried katsu. My boyfriend ordered the cheese filled curry katsu. The curry flavour was not overpowering at all. The miso soup was flavourful and the sesame dressing for the shredded cabbage was also very tasty. We also ordered the chicken karage that was served with a wasabi cream sauce which wasn't spicy at all. Everything tasted great!!

4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and the restaurant was pretty busy. We got served right away though and the waiters are super polite. Ordered the curry karaage thigh and two pork tender katsus (curry and chili garlic). The karaage thigh was delicious! Crunchy and flavourful. The mains were really juicy and had a flaky crunchy crust. We will be coming again!"}
{"text":"huge sushi foodie... I am trying to find the best of the best in vegas and i cannot find anything.. this place is way too expensive for poor taste in sushi. NOT HAPPY!"}
{"text":"Worthy sushi spot I. Vegas. Service was good and place is cool. Close to casino as side note . Sushi was above average but not great. I ordered Omakazi and the selection was not stellar. I would go back but not special. Sushi Roku still #1 for me"}
{"text":"This place has bomb katsu! Usually don't have much appetite for fried food but I decided to try this place since everyone had such positive reviews.

I tried the cheese katsu with the original sauce, which was really good! Batter wasn't too thick and the meat was tender. Free refills on sides definetely pushed it to 5 stars! 

Portions were huge...so its time for an afternoon nap 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"First time to Katsuya and I must say that I enjoyed the whole dining experience from beginning to end.  The atmosphere is pretty lively and loved the simple decor.  

The Omakase sashimi was delicious.   The selection of fish was fresh and tasty.  Must try the Crsipy Rice with tuna.  The lobster with house dynamite saucy was good as well, but I'd ask for light sauce.  I would have rather tasted more lobster.  I also enjoyed the yakisoba, they did not skimp on the seafood!

And on top of all the good food, the service was impeccable!  My server Ryan made sure my mom and I enjoyed our dinner and we had everything we needed.  It was a very busy night and it was just awesome that our server was always around when we needed.

I would definitely come back for more sashimi!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly interesting European twist on the sauce and presentation of their original katsu dish. It kind of ruined it for me, although for my Slavic parents, of course it was the dream restaurant as we are also incredible fanatics of Korean/Japanese food. Menu is incredible small, although reasonable. Interior is orgasm-worthy."}
{"text":"I came here because the menu looks extensive and the variety looks interesting. Plus, it's in SLS foodie hotel which i had great experience at Cleo and Bazaar. Must be good right? It was quite ordinary for the price tag. It wasn't bad, but wasn't an amazing sushi experience. 

Rock shrimp - Think of the chinese shrimp walnut with mayo sauce except this mixed in with sriracha sauce. It was okay, but not spectacular for $18. We didn't finish it. 

crispy spicy tuna - Check in Yelp to get it complimentary. The spicy tuna with the fried crispy rice was toasty! I like it!

wagyu ribeye - For $48, we probably had about 6 thin slices? Not bad for the wagyu price, but not high quality wagyu. We requested medium rare which appeared to be med rare, however the steak was dry and the flavor is not there. It was quite forgettable. 

porkbelly skewer - it was good and flaming. 

chef selection $175 - Very instagram photo worthy, but i would rather order my own sushi because we didnt eat the sushi roll. It came with lobster chawanmushi which was a small tea cup size portion (it was delish!), couple rolls, fresh sashimi, and the nigiri was quite enjoyable, but not amazing! The fish was fresh and i rather just order my own nigiri in the future. We had 3 people and couldnt finish the platter. 

Wagyu slider - mini burger that is juicy. 

Overall, our server was very attentive and the food was okay. It wasn't spectacular for me, but it was quite decent. I was expecting a bit more uniqueness in the taste and flavor."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Drinks are amazing! Came for happy hour on a Sunday when visiting Vegas. Customer service was great and sushi was very yummy"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick meal and was blown away. The A4 Fried Rice has set the bar for fried rice as the beef is flavorful and decadent. The sashimi was fresh leaving you to only crave more and the Crispy Rice w/ Spicy Tuna is the best I've had. Heard there was a Social Hour so I'll be sure to check that out sometime. Staff was great as well as the hospitality. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Probably worth a 4-4.5. At first I thought this place better be good because parking is a pain in the butt with the limited parking on property and there were any street parking around. Finally as able to find a tight squeeze after waiting for someone to leave. At first I thought this was going to be just another Katsu, but I was surprised. Although it was katsu, it was the sauce that was unique on each plate. 

Ordered the garlic chili katsu and it was surprisely good the fried garlic gave it really nice taste and smell to it. The sauce was well seasoned and the meat was nice and crispy, not like some places where you can taste the old oil. 

This place is worth checking out again."}
{"text":"I'd recommend coming here during their Social Hour at their regular bar (as opposed to their sushi bar). They have some great food and drink specials including their Watermelon Cucumber Mojito. It was really delicious! I have tried their Nigiri sampler which was five pieces of absolute delight. I love it when sushi melts in your mouth as you carefully take a bit into it. Then, I had their sauteed shishito peppers which were very well marinated and tasty. Finally, although I had their crispy brussel sprouts, it was okay. I really liked the nigiri sampler and the shishito peppers better.

Katsuya is always a good choice for great sushi. I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend lives right nearby this location so we pass by all the time and they finally opened!! I am so glad!

My boyfriend's best friend came up to Toronto for a day-trip so we decided to stop by for an early dinner and I must say that I am not disappointed in the slightest! The menu offers a plethora of variations on classic tonkatsu, and you can really get it just the way you like it! Each entrée comes with a delicious miso soup and the actual entrée itself is huge, making it a great value. I ordered the classic Japanese-style tonkatsu with cheese and it was perfectly crispy and had the perfect amount of cheese! The tonktasu sauce is served at the sauce and is nice and flavorful. The rice is well cooked, and the miso soup is replenished with a simple ask of your waiter or waitress. :)

I also need to mention that the ambience is great! The place is tucked in right across from the Starbucks. The place is really nice and clean and has a casual vibe. The staff are friendly and attentive, and overall we all had a great experience! I cannot wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! it was so close to my house so we eat there all the time. If you eat it, they offer refills on the miso soup! Everyone that works there are very nice and the katsu is the best in the city."}
{"text":"My favourite katsu spot. Super crispy on the outside and tender in the inside . Love their unlimited rice, miso soup, and cabbage too."}
{"text":"As an octogenarian attack helicopter, I came here with my old lady, a septuagenarian fighter jet (I know what you're thinking, we're both old huffers), this place was quite a treat!

Honestly, in my long years of service, I've seen it all--I've traversed the skies, touched the jetstream, bathed in the aurora borealis, locked eyes with Katrina, and zipped through hostile airspace of former USSR--my wizened old burners have seen better days. All that said, the katsu here was one of the best things I've ever experienced! Closest Katsu yet to the ones back in Osaka circa 2017. 

I can safely say that Katsuya has greased up both mine and my lady's rusty engines. Hot damn!"}
{"text":"I really love katsu and I grew up eating it as a kid, usually chicken katsu with regular tonkatsu sauce or with curry, but since moving away from home there aren't many options for good katsu. Coming to Toronto for a weekend trip with friends, definitely had a plan to get my fill of Japanese food and this restaurant caught our eye. 

We came for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It was pretty slow once we came in at 2pm, but started filling up later around 3-4pm. 

The menu was pretty extensive with so many types of katsu (pork loin, pork tender, chicken, fish, and cheese) and a lot of different types of sauces (original Katsuya, traditional Japanese, carbonara, sweet chili, garlic chili, curry, hot spicy, and terri mayo). There were so many types of different combinations of katsu and sauce that it was a bit overwhelming! They also had katsu burgers which ended up being really large and delicious. 

Each katsu set is served with miso soup, rice, cabbage, and the katsu (which is a very large portion). You can get unlimited refills on the miso soup, rice and cabbage which is awesome! 

Food: 
Traditional Japanese Pork Tender Katsu - I ended up ordering the traditional tonkatsu served with tonkatsu sauce and sesame seeds that you grind with a mortar and pestle. I wanted to go old-school and got exactly what I wanted. The classic tonkatsu sauce was perfect and the tonkatsu itself was so big and perfectly crispy and crunchy. 
Katsu Cheese Burger - One of my friends got the katsu cheese burger (cheese inside the tonkatsu that oozes out when you bite it) and she was having the time of her life eating that enormous but delicious looking burger. The tonkatsu was so big and basically falling out of the burger the whole time. The sauces in the burger reminded me of okonomiyaki sauces. I took a bite and it was pretty damn good and definitely worth the $12.

Server was really good and very friendly/funny! Our food came out pretty quickly and everyone was so full by the end of it because the portions are so large. It was very high quality of tonkatsu and even though I think the asian fusion options are kind of strange, I think they are good as well and people seem to like them."}
{"text":"I had he sweet chilli katsuya very savoury but lacked a bit of spice. The salad was very fresh and pork loin had a crispy layer."}
{"text":"This place used to be called Mr. Tonkatsu. Though the menu looks nicer it's prices seem to have gone up. 

The only reason I am giving this place three stars is the price to satisfaction ratio. The piece seemed small and the only way you would feel satisfied is if you eat the whole mound of rice (which isn't a good idea if you want to avoid getting diabetes). Parking spaces there are very limited and the AC was out so it felt a bit warm. 

Another thing though I am not penalizing them for it is I felt like I was invisible to the waitress staff. To the point that my friend had to let them know to take my order. I just found it funny and decided to laugh it off. 

The taste is good. The flavour of the meat shows through. The toasted sesame with tonkotsu sauce mixed with worsteshire sauce makes a good mix. Even their salad was great. 

However for $14 for the amount even given the area. I found it too expensive. And the portion was small for dinner. 

Crazy don is larger if you want better value."}
{"text":"Service was great and the portions were very generous! It's a small, cozy place to come for a date or with friends. The katsu was really flavourful and they had many different options as well. I went with the White Snow Chilli katsu and I really enjoyed it. Would have liked it a bit more if it was more spicy but I have a pretty high spice tolerance!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best katsu that I've ever had, and I don't even like katsu. Also, you MUST try their takoyaki, also, hands down the best takoyaki I've ever had! 

Check in and you get a free pop :) 

My friend and I came here on a Wednesday evening around 5:45PM. Located at the corner of Church and Gerrard. They weren't too busy, but the place isn't big either. They had about three cooks and one server. When you enter they greet you right away and seat you down. The menus are located on the tables already. The restaurant was super rustic, love the ambience. 

We ordered the takoyaki to share, my friend ordered one of their chilli garlic katsu ($15), and I ordered their katsu burger (w/cheese - $11 + $3 for combo). They started us off with a bowl of miso soup (complimentary), and you can get refills if you wanted ahah! First came the takoyaki, its basically the takoyaki ball deep fried, it was so yummy and smooth. Next, was the main, super hugemongous portion - can literally be two meals! 

Everything was great about it, no complaints. Will be back again! 

---

I went back again! This time with a couple more friends! Since I was sick, instead of killing my throats with the katsus, I stuck with their option of a soup udon with tempura shrimp. Let's just say, stick with the katsu options! The udon was pretty plain, came with two shrimp tempuras and a couple of different fish cakes."}
{"text":"Huge sized katsu portions! That was my first impression after ordering the Katsuya Original Pork Tenderloin. But I think it was just due to the large plates used. As for the taste, it was soft, crispy on the outside while tender on the inside. Plus the light sweetness of plum-like sauce somewhat  complimented the deep fried katsu. Also tried the Carbonara fish katsu, and I found the sauce to be quite creamy and tasty while the fish was alright. However, I wasn't impressed with the miso soup or the coleslaw/salad as they were both quite bland. 

Service was friendly but the server accidentally gave me the wrong order. Good thing she informed me before I dug in. At least they apologized and gave us tea on the house. 

Overall, I'd rate this place 3.5/5. Katsuya offers a variety of sauces and flavors for its katsu. It's a decent place to fill your deep fried cravings in a casual setting. Personally, I felt that their food tasted average. On a positive note, they do play nice Korean R&B and pop."}
{"text":"Baked Crab Hand Rolls are an absolute MUST.  We ordered them twice - after the first round we just had to have more.  The waitress told us these rolls are what made Chef Katsuya famous.  It is really easy to see why. 

Everything was divine except the spicy tuna rolls - topped with Serrano peppers - were actually not spicy at all.  Strange. 

If you are a champagne / sparkling wine lover, do pair your meal with both the Houhoushu Hana Pink and the Bunny Blueberry.  Served in Sake glasses and do ask your waitress to keep the bottles chilled next to your table.  

If you know Sushi, you know this food is perfection.  

By the way, the dress is quite casual.  We dressed up thinking \"SLS.\"  But there were many in there dressed casually and also lots of babies in strollers - which is way cool. We will bring baby next time cuz the walk from the SLS entrance to Katsuya is very short.  

It was very loud.  I appreciate the \"club\" atmosphere, but the music was trying too hard."}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant in the whole wide world and the food is so delicious ...and is must try and their sashimi omg super yummy ..."}
{"text":"Katsuya was sooooo good. The portions are big and definitely filling. We ordered the Carbonara and Original Cheese Tonkatsu which both came with miso soup and a side of salad. Both were flavourful and delicious. Definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, unlimited soup, rice, and cabbage.  Katsu(s) were all juicy inside and crisp on outside.  Leave full and satisfied every time.  Only thing is the seating is kinda stupid I don't want to sit on barstools for an hour eating a full meal."}
{"text":"Comfy place, casual ambiance, child-friendly.
Food-wise, I personally think they are trying too hard with the different sauces and toppings for katsu. I guess thats just their differentiation strategy, but some of them just dont make sense. The classic katsu and curry katsu tasted so-so, definitely not up there with Mr. Tonkatsu. Give it a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant and boy was it worth it.  I love sushi and always go for quality and not quantity.  Katsuya did not disappoint.  The fish was so fresh.  The wait staff is so attentive and even pours my drinks for me.  Felt like royalty. It is more on the pricier side.  There was a couple that took one look at the menu and left.  Their loss.
Also ordered uni, amaebi, and unagi.  Uni was one of the freshest I've had anywhere.  Be prepared to spend some cash if you can afford it, go there."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with three parking spots right in front. But don't worry, there's actually more spots at the back of the building. Crisis adverted, big sigh of relief. 

There's not a lot of variety to the menu. A few appetizers to choose from and the main is just fried protein with a selection of sauces to pair with. Even though the choices are limited, definitely wouldn't mind eating the same thing every time. It's simple but everything is just done right. Tried the original sauce, terri mayo, curry and carbonara and they were all amazing. Pork stuffed with ooey gooey cheese, big bonus. Miso soup, cabbage coleslaw and rice are unlimited so it says on the menu. Personally never asked for more because the huge piece of fried meat is intimidating enough. 

Overall, will definitely come back for more. There are actually times now where there's a slight katsuya craving during the week. Might want to bring a jacket, always find the restaurant a little chilly."}
{"text":"It's a nice place with a vast menu and interesting and unique proposal which worth a try"}
{"text":"Great food, portion sizes, price, and service. I loved it with the sweet/spicy sauce. 
I would definitely return."}
{"text":"We just had probably the most perfect meal I can remember, and I must say, we eat out quite a bit.  5 courses, 7 perfect dishes between my wife and me. Yellowtail sashimi, ceviche, brussels sprouts, rock shrimp, wagyu, black cod, omakase nigiri and a tasting of 4 desserts. Service was outstanding. Better than Sen, better than Raku, even better than the famed $$$ Guy Savoy. 

Oh yeah, it was Restaurant Week so it was $50/person. Mind blowing."}
{"text":"Too overpriced of an experience for 5 stars.

The $27 seafood yakisoba was the saltiest bowl of nonsense I ever had. I live in a Japanese community in LA, quality knows quality. My party of 5 ordered 3 yakisobas and nobody enjoyed it. 

The rolls were ok, but didn't blow anybody's mind. One girl from my party asked for chili sauce and it came when she already finished eating.

4 out of us 5 got our food right away, but one of us didn't get our rolls until the very end. 

Such a horrible experience from entrance to exit. The hostesses originally told me they close at 10:30pm but Yelp said 11pm.

*rolls eyes*

Trust me, this is Vegas, there are SO many better places that offer better food. 

The only thing that DID taste good was the $15 watermelon cucumber mojito- and even that wasn't strong enough to make me forget this bad experience."}
{"text":"Appetizers are 10/10, the mains themselves are pretty good. Portion sizes surprisingly large, overall a very pleasant experience for casual dining."}
{"text":"From sushi snob! That's me - Wow! I've never ever seen a restaurant like this in my life!!! Zuma + hakassan + roka + nobu + mortons = katsuya. 
It's amazing!!!! Chef Josh and our server Matt were incredible. We're here for 3 days and I don't want to eat anywhere else!"}
{"text":"The second location of this tonkatsu mini-chain is conveniently located downtown at Ryerson University. A great location considering its menu and pricing is appealing for the student crowd.

I ordered the Katsuya Original chicken katsu dish and was impressed by the portion size of the protein! The chicken katsu was huge and could easily be split between two people. It came with miso soup, rice and a cabbage salad as well, but the highlight was definitely the deliciously fried katsu-great value for around $14.

The restaurant serves their tonkatsu in many other styles as well, such as carbonera, chili cheese, terriyaki mayo, and the like. The Katsuya Original used a rich, savory sauce that had a hint of sweetness in it. The other styles looked more over the top, and I would love to try them on my next visit here =)

Another positive note about this place was the service that was provided. The hostess here was very friendly and accommodating, and she checked in with us often throughout our meal. A pleasant surprise given that this place was an affordable and casual eatery-not somewhere you'd typically expect to get great service at =)"}
{"text":"If you love Katsu curry, I would definitely check this place out.

They have a wide variety of katsu, so if you ever get bored of the same traditional flavours (how could you?), then you have 10 other unique styles and sauces here.

Parking sucks."}
{"text":"I went to a location in LA and loved the experience. Great food and great atmosphere. 
I've been to the one here at the SLS a few times and I'm never disappointed. The service is good, all the employees are friendly. And the food is still great. I don't like how the restaurant is open to the casino...it's not great smelling cigars and cigarettes while eating sushi. But what can you do. 
The summer menu is also an amazing deal. I was stuffed by the time dessert came. 
Overall, a great place to eat and take friends before a fun night out."}
{"text":"Good food and decent service (nothing special though).  Presentation was very nice, but I am looking to be more blown away at a place like this as far as the food goes.  Reading the other reviews, it seems to be liked more by others, which is fine, but the place was pretty empty and quiet when I was there, which made it feel cold, even in the booth.  Things didn't warm up until the food came which was sizzling and welcome, but I can't go higher than 3 stars."}
{"text":"This was one of the restaurants we looked forward on trying on our 6 day stay in Sin city. We got there at 8 PM when we had reservation and the restaurant was not even half full. In a city where popular places need reservation it could be because of the location at the fairly new SLS hotel far down in the north end of the strip close to Stratosphere where theres not that much action. 

Anyway when seated our waitress Jennifer tells me about the 50% of Sake bottles and i say we will think about it.  She comes and takes our order and again tries to sell us on the sake bottles where some bargains could be bottles that normally go for about 250 $ only is 125 $. We kindly decline since i dont like sake at all.  

We order 2 appetizers, another small dish to share and 3 mains. We ask Jennifer if the dishes are big as we had eaten a few hours earlier and she says that \"Its a good start\" and that we can order more afterwards.  

For the food:  

*Wagyu Sliders +2
We where informed by Jennifer that this little baby was cooked through since it was pork inside? Hmm why put pork in a slider with the expensive wagyu beef meat so you would have to cook it dry? What does people who dont eat pork out of religious reasons think about a beef slider that includes pork without it beeing mentioned in the menu? Anyway, the sliders where dry and tasteless and the taste of ginger was all we could find.  

*Sticky rice with spicy  tuna +3
Nice fresh tuna and the rice was ok on this signature dish though we couldnt call it spicy even if we tried. 

*Steamed lobster in broth +3
The lobster was cooked in a proper way and tasted ok but since we are from scandinavia we are used to exceptional seafood and this was more \"ok\".  The broth was tasty. 

*Wagyu Carpaccio +4
This was one of the best dishes where the gorgeous meat was the star. Thinly sliced and with lightly seasoned it was a hit dish.  

*Bass with szechuan sauce +4
By far the best dish of the evening. Superb cooked bass that well in pieces when touched. It had a crispy skin and an amazing szechuan sauce with a tangy nice kick.  Order this and thank me later!   

Our little Jennifer came by a third time to sell us some discount bottle Sake and asked if i really had tried it both hot and cold. I really dont like people who cant take a hint and her pushy ways was part of making this dinner one of the worst of our 6 days in Vegas.  I would rather eat on Fatburger or Dennys where the service is nice and with a smile. 

The price with 4 beers was a hefty 141 $ with tax but without tip.  
While the food was not bad but rather mediocre the price and Jennifer was what brought our experience down. And im not very sensitive to high prices as long as the quality of the  food is the same level. We had a +400 $ tasting menu at Alize a couple of days later that was worth every penny.  

Will not be coming back on my next Vegas vacation. 
Im feeling generous today and will give Katsuya a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"I came here with two friends for dinner on New Years Eve and was very disappointed with the overall experience. In short, our service was terrible. After a long wait for our waiter, we waited 25 minutes for our first dish to come out. By this point, our waters and beers were both drained and they sat empty for quite a while longer. I requested a side of sauce when one of my dishes arrived and was told by the waiter that the kitchen was too backed up. Too backed up for a side of sauce? After this, we remained mostly ignored while our waited visited the table of high rollers next to us 3 times. Our starter order of edamame came after we had finished the majority of our food. Our largest order of sashimi was completely forgotten and only brought to us after asking the waiter (for which he delivered with our check!). The food we got was all delicious and representative of a high end sushi restaurant however I would recommend the myriad of other great sushi options when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"The happy hour menu was AWESOME! service was fast and delightful...Jose at the bar was helpful and ensured a great time here at Katsuya. Would definitely recommend this sushi spot for all who are craving a fix!!"}
{"text":"Family came here for my birthday and the food is amazing!!! I ordered the classic katsuya plate while my husband ordered the carbonara one, as both pork loin. I prefer my husband's plate as it is so tasty!!!!! The portions are generous and they are deep fried nice and light and fluffily! Our friend ordered the takoyaki appy and that was also sooooo yummy!!! Our total bill was about $35.00 so it's very fair pricing and will ded  leave you full and very satisfied."}
{"text":"I found a bug in the raspberry in the Mochi ice cream. The waitress was very impatient, every time we needed to order something she would run off to get it but wasn't finish ordering.  She talked too fast that was hard to understand her.  The furniture was cheap and not comfortable.  other food was okay. The manager took some items off the bill though."}
{"text":"This restaurant experience was very good in my opinion. When I came, I got the original Japanese pork tender katsu. It tasted AMAZING. I also appreciate how the restaurant provides customers with unlimited bowls of miso soup, salad and rice. The portions were just right. I left feeling satisfied. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here for social hour. Paul was a great server. The house Pinot noir was middle of the road but it was \"fine\". What really shined here was the signature crispy rice with tuna. I likely could have eaten 4 serving a of it. California roll was decent as well.  Good option when you don't want to leave the hotel. I would return if staying at this hotel again."}
{"text":"From the host greeting us, to our server, Matt, and all the other guys who took care of us, we were treated so well at Katsuya. The staff was sensitive and knowledgeable about my egg allergy, with suggestions given to me because of it. 
Presentation of food was excellent! Order the Wagyu Filet with Foie Gras and Miso Marinated Black Cod. Yummy! Because of my egg allergy, they weren't able to give me a complimentary dessert for my birthday, so they opted instead to bring my husband and I glasses of champagne to celebrate. That was a very sweet gesture. 
My husband also ordered the rainbow roll and said that the fish on top was so fresh that he didn't really even have to chew his food. Lol. He ordered the Cucumber Watermelon Mojito, and loved it. He said it was very refreshing, and that the alcohol taste wasn't overpowering. He said it's the kind of drink that the alcohol effects could just sneak up on you. If there's a Burning Mandarin martini, I will definitely order it. This was the best one I've had yet! It had the perfect combination of fruit,  spice drop the Serrano chili, and sweetness from the sugared rim. 
Thank you for the memorable birthday dinner, guys!"}
{"text":"This is most definitely my favorite sushi spot to go to when I come to Vegas! I come specifically for the baked crab hand rolls And their delicious cocktails! I brought my girlfriends in for their first time. Food came out just in time. It was almost like they had a system! :)  we were all happy with the service from the greetings at the host stand to the server. Even the manager passed by to check on the table and made sure everything was great!! Thank you Katsuya family for making our girls night out so awesome!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. They just opened here but I've been to the downtown location before. The curry sauce is amazing and so are the wings!"}
{"text":"Holy crap. This place is great. Legit, the tonkatsu here is as good as it gets. I ordered the spicy garlic pork tonkatsu and OMGAH it was absolutely amazing. I'm a huge garlic lover and the fried garlic with the sauce had me making unnatural noises. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Each tonkatsu dish comes with a bowl of miso soup, radishes, rice, and some coleslaw(?) salad. The miso soup doesn't taste watery at all, and the best part is - the miso soup is refillable!! Not sure how many times you can ask to refill your bowl but it's good to know you can have more than one bowl. 

I can't believe this place has been open for so long already and this is only my first time here. Apparently it's a sister restaurant to Mr. Tonkatsu - which is also good but I think the food is much better here. I'm for sure coming back!"}
{"text":"Came to Katsuya for a girls night out. Made a reservation and was seated promptly even when it was a full house. The hostess was friendly and welcoming. 

Our waiter (sorry forgot his name) greeted us immediately and we started the night with his recommendation of a round of the house special cocktails \"Katsuya Fresh\" which was a mixture of lime, vodka, sake and cucumber. It was light and refreshing which paired with our meal perfectly. 

Now onto the food:

Appetizers: 

Corn Tempura: amazing! If you're a corn lover like me you'll love this dish. 

Crispy Brussels Sprouts: I try to be healthy even tho this dish is fried. 

Creamy Rock Shrimp: I've tried this dish both here and Yellowtail and I have to say this definitely beats YTs. It was crisped perfectly and not overly drenched with the mayo sauce. 

Crispy Rice w/Spicy Tuna: this one is a must order out of all the appetizers!!

Yellowtail Sashimi w/Jalapeño: super light and refreshing and it came perfectly right after all the fried apps we just had. 

Main Entrees:

Braised Short Ribs: marinated perfectly and so tender that you can eat with just the fork and if you like wasabi like me you'll love the mash potatoes along with it. 

A4 Wagyu Fried Rice: Wagyu Kobe Beef. No need for further explanation. 

Miso-Marinated Black Cod: mmmmmm my FAVORITE of all!! Amazing flavor and tasted so fresh and flaky. 

Sushi:

Corn Crunch Roll: like I mentioned I love corn and this roll was rolled with the corn tempura along with garlicky shrimp YUM!

Tiger Roll: just like all other ones I've tried at other places but this one took it another notch up by topping it with caviar and truffle oil.

Omakase Sashimi: super delicious and fresh. 

We ended the dinner with a hot steamy bowl of miso soup which was perfect after 3 rounds of cocktails. 

I highly recommend Katsuya. Even tho it is kind of off strip but definitely worth the drive over."}
