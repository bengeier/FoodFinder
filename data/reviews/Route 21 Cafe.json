{"text":"I've been here twice, and am not super impressed.  I am reluctant to give them a 2 star review because this restaurant is better than a vacant store-front, but at the same him \"meh\" pretty much sums up my experience here.  The food is fine, but not worth going out for.  The atmosphere makes me feel sad.  Service was good.

Both times I visited, I left thinking \"the next time I drive by, this place will be out of business.\""}
{"text":"This is a nice, very unassuming diner, good for breakfast and lunch. No dinner hours. Standard breakfast items, good salads, soups, sandwiches. Honest food, a step up from the standard \"family restaurant\" but at a good price. Free wifi, utilitarian decor and seating. I choose this above chain and family restaurants because the service is always good, the food is just a little better (for example, salads are mixed greens, no iceberg lettuce in sight), and there is never a wait."}
{"text":"Nice simple breakfast/lunch spot. Cute decor and well prepared food and a great price. I had the eggs, wheat toast, bacon and potatoes, but also sampled the chocolate chip pancakes. Everything was tasty and the service was freindly and effcient."}
{"text":"Don't believe what you read. I read the 4 reviews and decided to try this place out. But believe this:

The food served was breakfast: a hard meal to mess up. They messed it up by serving \"Gordon Food Service\" quality on our plates. Seriously, garbage. And it was eggs and potatoes. The wheat toast was good. Coffee was bland. Pancakes were terrible and all but two bites were left on the plate. And the sausage took the prize for \"worst ever\" being frozen links cooked up and plated. Gross. 

I feel bad for the owners that the plaza is under construction - another reason when we pulled up and had some reservations about going inside (but we wanted to support the local joint that appeared to be suffering due to the construction cones blocking patrons from bothering to go in) but they aren't going to make it with the awful decor and lack of atmosphere. 

Good luck with your endeavors. I'll be heading back to Sal's on West 25th or Charlie's on Broadview."}
{"text":"Great new addition to Independence.  This is a Breakfast/Lunch place ONLY- close at 2pm. They have a variety of sandwiches, salads, and soups, along with breakfast all day. Their food is extremely fresh and great proportions.  They also provide daily specials. 

I had the chicken, bacon, ranch  wrap with pasta salad- and it was delicious!"}
