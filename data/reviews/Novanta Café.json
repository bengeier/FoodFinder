{"text":"This place is as good as it gets in Montreal. Warmest welcome from Marco and Rocco as you enter, in the winter it's always an amazingly warm escape. Smell of amazing coffee and pizza cooking in the back.  Probably the best pizza I've eaten in North America, Rocco is a master. All the Italian goodies that you won't find anywhere else, such an awesome selection.  Everything is reasonably priced, gourmet sizeable pizza slice under $5? Crazy good.  Really busy at times, but you never feel left out or forgotten. There's just a really great atmosphere that the lads have created.  We'll miss this place leaving Montreal!"}
{"text":"What struck me most at Novanta was the warm welcome. The guy who served me (Marco?) is very energetic and friendly. I was there for a couple of hours in the middle of the week. Many of the customers were regulars there and the owner knew them by name and made their regular drinks. Some of them stayed for a short chat (more than talking about the weather). I also liked the pop playlist quite a bit.   They have a nice collection of pastries. They serve pizza, panini and breakfast as well, though I haven't tried them yet. The ambience is cool, with several tables throughout the place and high chairs by the large windows up front. The prices are reasonable.   There are shelves on one of the walls, lined with small Italian goodies of various sorts. It adds to the character of the place.   Overall, it is a tasteful neighbourhood cafe and a good place to catch up with a friend or work a bit."}
{"text":"This new café is full of Italian delicacies, from delicious coffee to tasty cannolis, bagels, pizzas, etc. They even have a section where you can buy Italian products!  We stopped by over the weekend and had fantastic service and delicious coffee! Definitively recommend stopping by for a quick bite, or for a cozy study spot. I bet this place will become very popular!"}
{"text":"Nice little café; the owner is super friendly and the coffee is good (Italian style). They have also food at very reasonable prices, make sure to try a slice of pizza and one of their desserts: you're not going to be disappointed!"}

{"text":"A small Italian invation in the heart of the pmateau. I was walking with my sun...a little gloomy outside and well felt like coffe. I never noticed this place so I said lets give it a try. The service may be a little slow but it is worth the waiting. Loved the coffe and the biscotti (needed a break from croissants) was just as it should be. The prices are more tge reasonable I mean 3$ for a latte is very good. Lots of candy and stuff from italy that not only create a nice atmosphere they are also delicious. Also being sourounded by italians for me is another evidance I discovered a hidden jem. I guess mt way to McGill just got longer now :)"}
