{"text":"Holy mackerel, I didn't expect to get fried rice and Thai ice tea of this caliber from a food truck in an Asian market parking lot. In fact it's the best fried rice and Thai ice tea I have had in a long time.  Five star food but I have to take one star away due to the litter around the business (I am pretty sure the food truck is part of the Asian market). There is a picnic table with benches outside of the market where you can sit down to eat."}
{"text":"I was lucky to stumble upon this place when I was stocking up for some ingredients to make summer rolls and curries at the V&K Asian Market off 85. The first time I came, the food truck was closed...but the second time it was open and I snuck in an order before a line formed. I wanted to order the red curry, but it was not available- so I tried their Pad Thai which was nice and pleasantly spicy and easily enough for three meals. I also got the spring rolls. Everything was a great deal and the Thai iced tea was great, too. It looks like the store and food truck are family run, which is nice to support. I am hesitant to give a five star rating since I have only eaten here once....so I will update my review next time I stop by....which should be soon!"}
{"text":"Best Laos food ever..aut seen..One of jp food togo specials for today..loved it...delicious...go get some before it's sold out"}
{"text":"I am always looking for great Thai or Asian food, thanks to Yelp I found this food truck not too far from Uptown. As soon as you get off of Little Rock exit be prepared to get in the left turning lane because its almost immediately on your left in a parking lot beside a shopping center strip. I was able to text in my order and I immediately received a response my order was received.  When I arrived my food was ready so I was impressed with the promptness.  I ordered the Pad Se Ew, it comes with chicken and I ordered the Chicken Larb. I wasn't sure what to expect with the Chicken Larb, I ordered it based off of the pictures from Yelp. It is extremely spicy which is noted on the menu but it was too spicy for me to enjoy. The Pad Se Ew was ok. The chicken had an interesting texture and taste to me. I did enjoy the noodles and sauce of the Pad Se Ew, for $5 I could not really complain. I will probably try this food truck again and try some different menu items, you really cant beat a meal for $5 and they are very prompt."}
{"text":"When you and your mama  too lazy to cook authentic Laos food , this is the place to go !"}
{"text":"My go to for Asian on the West Side.. I haven't order Chinese since I discovered this place. Fresh, amazing and inexpensive. I've never had Laotian food until I started going here and now I'm hooked Not far from my house and the White Water Center. They are always so friendly. I also go to their market for fresh produce and ingredient for my home made Pho."}
{"text":"Located next to hardees. I drove pass and had to turn around. Its a food truck! Quick, great prices and quality food. There is nooooooo where in Charlotte yiu can get 10 wings for $5 nowhere and they taste good. Excellent customer service and friendly smile. U can call in the order for quick pickup or walknup to the window then wait in your car or sit at the picnic table."}
{"text":"I love their nam khao. At first they sold out at lunch but was able to make more so I was lucky enough to get my order in (3). It's made perfectly with a nice crunch and sweet flavor. The veggies are a nice addition so I wrap it up to eat. I also ordered the papaya salad medium spice. It was sweet and spicy. Both were so good I ate it all by myself. You have to check them out. Their food and drinks are delicious."}
{"text":"This place is bomb!   At first glance, the place may seem a bit sketchy. This is a food truck parked on the side of V&K Asian Market. The parking lot fits a max of 7 cars at a time but with creative parking, It fills up with 20+ cars, no exaggeration. Between the store customers and food truck customers, it's rare to find the lot empty. Be patient, smile at those creative drivers and suck It up cause the food here is worth It.   I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume (based on the logo on the side of the truck) this place is run by 3 guys who are either friends or related. Nothing better than supporting locally owned joints around the hood. Just a few guys making an honest living and dishing out real AUTHENTIC TRADITIONAL Lao food. No shortcuts here, no fusion, just straight up the kind of food I grew up eating from my Lao friends' homes.   What do i love about this place, you ask?  Here, let me count the reasons.  1. Sticky rice. Good old steamed sticky rice that's been soaked overnight for maximum softness but still glutinous and sticky enough to grab the food.  2. Jeow Bong. A paste like sauce made with roasted Thai bird chili and seasonings ground by hand in a mortar and pestle.  3. Larb. Moist chunks of chicken and it's skin marinated in lime juice, toasted rice powder and other seasonings, topped with a variety of fresh chopped herbs. Or chopped beef with tripe in the same sauce - but the beef is cooked perfectly, maintaining a tender medium rare taste. Both served room temperature and usually only made at special gatherings.  4. Papaya salad, aka Thum Mahong. They're not modifying It for the tender of tastebuds. This salad has chunks of tamarind flesh and real homemade padek which is a type of fish sauce that may assault your nostrils but the umami of It just cant be substituted. If you've ever had Thai papaya salad, you haven't tasted the full umami flavor yet.  5. Lao sausage. Fatty chunks of pork mixed with all the perfect seasonings, a little bit of pork skin for texture and rice to give It a slightly sour taste - trust me, it's all good.   There are plenty of Thai restaurants in the Charlotte area and a few Lao stores that serve a few dishes but aside from the few gatherings I'm invited to and the annual Cambodian and Lao New Year celebrations at the temple, I don't have access to this type of food. This food truck has changed the Lao food scene. Go get yourself some!"}
{"text":"Omg love jp to go it's js a little too far but for the price and food yea I'll drive! Everything is awesome I need to try out other food they have been I'm always stuck on the Laos sausages!"}
{"text":"Cool concept, a  food truck next to an Oriental Market serving Laos food.  I had papaya salad, Lao sausages, sticky rice, and spicy meatballs, then iced coffee for a drink.  I know a lot of food for one person, but I wanted to try everything on the menu.  Lol.  A young boy took my order, basically I ordered my iced coffee with light on cream and sugar, I got it loaded with cream and tons of sugar.  Huge disappointment!  I ordered the papaya salad medium, he wrote \"hot\" and it was super spicy.  The tomatoes were not fresh.  Laos sausage was very fatty and blend.  The spicy meatballs on stick, mediocre. I did have to remind myself this is a food truck (street food), so I will get just that."}
{"text":"Papaya salad is great. Coconut curry fried rice is great...when fresh. And their bamboo soup is just like how the OGs make it!"}
