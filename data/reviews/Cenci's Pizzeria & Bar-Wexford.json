{"text":"This is one of our favorite place to eat in wexford. Nothing fancy, just pizza and wings as well as several other italian-american menu. There is a family dining area that are usually packed after children's sports practice. The bar area is quieter than most bars in shadyside and they serve food until 2am. My first time here, I ordered cajun pasta with wedding soup... I'm still ordering the same thing for a year since it became one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Horrible delivery experience. Very late, cold, greasy, Had to throw the zucchini away, it was so limp and cold. No responsiveness from staff when we called to complain."}
{"text":"Staying at hotel ordered pizza and it was just ok. Did not like the crust thought it was very very doughy and thought was expensive."}
{"text":"We got two extra large pizzas to go and we're very pleased with the pies and the size!! When they say Extra large they mean it!!  The five cheese was delicious and the veggie exactly what we hoped for! We preordered and everything was ready and hot when we picked it up. Would go back again. The menu looked inviting."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Delivery until 2 am seven days a week is a big deal for me since I work from 11 pm until 7:30 am. Most places around Warrendale/Cranberry are closed at 10 pm. The food is always fresh and tasty. I get eggplant or zucchini parmasean dinner, appetizer, or sandwich mostly and they are delicious and very generous portions. The Chicago pizza is soooo good. The stuffed pizza is incredible. The wings are just right. The stuffed banana peppers are spicy enough for my taste. I took my wife and daughter there once and they liked it a lot. There is a full bar and lots of tv's for watching the game. This place puts Spaghetti Warehouse to shame (see my review)"}
{"text":"Today, we decided to try a new pizza restaurant, Cenci's. This restaurant has the advantage of being proximal to home and boasts extended hours. In addition, I had a coupon for a large pizza and 15 wings. The first surprise was to learn that the 15 wings could only be served in one flavor. I had expected that this was a large enough number of wings that two flavors would be possible. Shrugging in disappointment, I placed the order anyway. When I arrived to pick up my order, I was given a total approximately $2 higher than was expected. Questioning this, the cashier broke down the total. This came to what I expected and I again questioned the extra $2. She did not know why this additional charge was present. When she sought the help of another employee, he informed us that mushrooms, ordinary, white button mushrooms garner an additional charge, just, as he stated, \"like seafood\". This is the first time that I have ever heard anyone classify ordinary, run of the mill, available in every grocery store, white, button mushrooms as such an expensive item as to be comparable to seafood. The employee volunteered that the prices were high, but that the customer must pay a premium because of the location (Wexford) of the establishment. He further stated that the high prices were justifiable because they make the best pizza around. Simply stating that the pizza is \"the best\" is insufficient to make it true. It is, rather, patently untrue. I shall address this assertion later in this discourse.

At this point, I figured I was just out of luck and would be forced to pay the premium for the mushrooms. The employee stated that it was company policy and that he could not change it. He did offer to get a manager, but stated that he doubted the manager could fix the issue. I accepted the offer to speak to the manager, if only to make my displeasure known.

It should be noted at this point that the prices at this restaurant are on the high side for pizza. With the coupon, the total for a large two topping pizza (I paid for an extra topping) and 15 wings came to over $25.

Fortunately, the manager was able to make an adjustment for the extra charge for mushrooms. He asserted that the extra charge is fair because mushrooms are expensive and because they are generous with the amount of mushrooms that are included. As previously mentioned, these are ordinary, white button mushrooms that sell for $1.39 (regular price) at the grocery store.

When I got home (about a 5 minute drive away), I tasted the pizza and the wings. The pizza was not bad, but neither was it good. It was quite ordinary and similar to other pizzas from chain restaurants. The crust was neither chewy nor crisp. It had no distinguishing flavor or texture. The sauce was slightly sweet, and had a faint hint of oregano. Again, quite ordinary and similar to other pizzas from chain restaurants. The cheese layer was thin, the crust poked through the cheese in numerous locations. Additionally, the cheese layer ended approximately 1/2 - 3/4\" before the sauce layer. (Yes, I measured it). The slices of mushroom were very thin and very sparse. The first slice of pizza that I randomly selected from the box boasted a scant half piece of mushroom. No piece had more than 3 thin slices of mushroom. The pepperoni was, perhaps, the pizza's only saving graceThe pepperoni did cover the pie completely and the edges of some of the pieces were crisp.

Next, I sampled the wings. Since only one flavor was allowed, I chose the medium sauce. The sauce was, as expected, a commercial buffalo sauce. There was just enough sauce to barely cover the 1.5\" long jumbo (so Cenci's claims) wings. This was enough to lightly flavor the wings without truly flavoring them. Despite the lack of the sauce, the wings were soft and soggy with none of the crispness one expects from well cooked wings. The meat inside was hard and dry. In one case, I bit into a wing and encountered something so hard that I was afraid I had inadvertently eaten a bone. Fortunately, it was not a bone. It was, however, a piece of rock hard meat. These wings were definitely overdone.

The best thing to come out of the whole experience is that I no longer have to wonder if there is a hidden gem in my neighborhood every time I drive by. Now, I know. I do not."}
{"text":"The worst take out they gave us the wrong order we had to go back and they gave us cold pizza with cold soggy subs. The food was not edible!"}
{"text":"Cenci's has the best pizza in Wexford.  The restaurant is your typical bar/pizza place with booths and tables for crowds.  The servers are consistent and friendly.  The specialty pizzas are great especially the buffalo chicken and steak onion ranch pizzas."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from Cenci's for years and the quality has really gone downhill. Tonight, we got undercooked meatballs on stale bread and a pizza so doughy, we couldn't pick it up to get it out of the box. This isn't the first time the pizza has been undercooked. The last few times, I've had to place it in the oven upon arrival to finish baking. Tonight, it was so raw we couldn't even get it to the oven. For a medium pizza, meatball sub, and delivery we spent almost $30 for an unedible meal. I will no longer give this place the benefit of the doubt based on how good it used to be."}
{"text":"Great family friendly atmosphere. Cenci's staff is friendly and very helpful. It's a great place to watch a game with friends or have dinner with family."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, they are rude, their food is over priced and it sucks!

I would not wipe my ass with this pizza!"}
{"text":"I stopped here a couple weeks ago and sat at the bar. After 5 minutes of the bartender texting on her phone and not even acknowledging me, I left.

I stopped here on Friday for a late lunch - hoping for a better outcome. It was pretty empty... and the service was still slow and inattentive. Food was just alright. 
Don't think I'll be back. It wasn't terrible; but there are plenty of better options in the area."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoy their food, especially the pizza. The atmosphere is usually upbeat and fun (I'm not a fan of trivia night, so I avoid going then). The service could definitely more more attentive, especially in the bar area, but the staff is always very friendly and accommodating. Their delivery service is great, too: the food arrives not soggy and piping hot to very warm. We order from them at least twice a month at work. We are fans!"}
{"text":"First time back since the remodel. There are some definite pros and cons to this place. Pro- food has always been fairly tasty and they have a decent beer selection. Con- service is painfully slow and beer is expensive. 
Wait staff has always been very friendly, but tend at times to not be all that attentive. Example from tonight: we sat at the table for 20 minutes after finishing our meals waiting for a check. At times waitress was taking drinks that were only half empty and filling right away, then later we would sit empty forever. But, she was very nice though.
The food always tends to be very slow to come out here as well. To the point where you wondering if something is wrong. 
Great beer selection but I was shocked when my pint of beer was $7.00. I really enjoy craft beers and I'm used to paying for it, but amazed that a standard draft pint was $7.
All in all this place has decent food, slow service, great beers but tends to be expensive. I'm sure I'll go back but kick myself again for going."}
{"text":"The specialty pizza's are fantastic (the Staub / Buffalo Chicken).  Wings are great (Hot BBQ is a winner) and I love that they serve food everyday till 2am...that right there is amazing.    Great bar TV set up.
I've been there with small kids a few times and the young waitresses understood timing that by getting them drinks and food first quickly.  Also was good at checking back to make sure things are smooth.
They should definitely get the NHL network."}
{"text":"This has become our go to place for hoagies and pizza, both sit down and delivery.  Try the wedding soup too.

Also, they always have an interesting selection of draft and bottled beers.

Friendly wait staff. Lots of regulars at the bars. Plenty of TVs everywhere for sports."}
{"text":"We visited Cenci's this past weekend and it was your typical Pittsburgh pizza joint.........  full of yinzers enjoying mediocre food. Everyone was nice and the service was good and their traditional crust was delicious. However, that where it ended.....  very skimpy toppings and flavorless cheese.   If you're looking for mediocre food with nice people, this is your kind of place. If not, move on."}
{"text":"The bread twists were very good as an appetizer. There was plenty of butter for dipping if desired. The salad was decent but for a bit pickier family members the dinner salad wasn't good for them bc of the amount of white lettuce. For what the salad cost a nice toss of spring mix would make it much more enjoyable. My chix parm was quite filling & I found it very tasty. The service was good and overall a good dinner. I'd actually score Cencis a 3.5. Look on Groupon for special offers."}
{"text":"We came to Cenci's for Trivia night. It was packed and getting a spot was crazy, and actually people were quite rude about that, but that's no fault of the  restaurant. Got a bunch of appetizers, cheese fries, jalapeño poppers, and garlic knots. All were pretty good. 

Got pizza with pepperoni mushroom and onion. Thought the pizza was average to good, but nothing spectacular. Maybe the dough just couldn't hold up all the toppings...

Sister got the Buffalo chicken salad. The Buffalo chicken actually tasted a lot like butter which I get is an essential component of Buffalo sauce but it was overpowering and the lettuce wasn't great. I get it, a salad at a pizza joint, but it was a Pittsburgh salad so...overall just okay. Service was friendly and attentive. I'd be back but again there are a lot of good pizza places in the burgh."}
{"text":"I have come here a total of 4 times and more often than not there is an issue. This last time will be my last. The POS system went down and we had to wait over 25 minutes before my card could be run. While waiting they offered us another beverage and then charged us for them. It is ridiculous that we are charged for their issues. The service also was less that desirable, with our server disappearing."}
{"text":"Got pizza for the first time. Looking for a new favorite pizza place. Not so much. Ordered a half pepperoni and mushroom. There was hardly any cheese on the pizza. It looked dry. Pizza tasted bland. Also ordered wings. Hardly any sauce on them. Did give us a lot of celery, though. The quest for great pizza is still on. Won't order here again."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza joint in this neck of the woods hands down. The staffs just as good as the pizza."}
{"text":"Update Nov. 2015: I've had great pizza a few times and great beers. It's one of the few places locally that is open very late (2am). For that, I salute Cenci's with 4 stars. 


I've come in here for drinks a couple of times. It can get rowdy on weekend nights, but I guess that is a given. For beers, I'd rather go down the road to the Wexford Ale House for selection. Although Cenci's has a nice, newer, spacious interior which I like. I find it's normally a younger crowd here, with the pool table, darts etc. Sometimes there are even groups of kids after their sports games in here for a pizza party which can be annoying if you don't find the concept of children running around shouting appealing. 

I have had pizza once here, which is definitely okay. I'd probably order to-go rather than eat in. 

Strictly for beers (and maybe a game of pool) I'll have maybe one here once and a while but I like a larger variety so on to the next one for me! This is definitely somewhere to go if you have a large group."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time eating there with my family and this was less than stellar.  The first time we were happy that we went back.  This time was much different.  It was a Wednesday night and there were only 3 other tables in the restaurant.  Our waitress started off well but then when she said she would be right back to take our order, we watched her walk around the restaurant multiple times (including cleaning tables) while we were sitting and watching her obviously waiting for her.

We place our order and our appetizer and salad came very quick.  Then came our entrees.  My daughter is a small child and her meal was brought last.  And when I mean last, it was a few minutes after the other meals were there.  That lead to lots of questions and complaining from her about her meal.  Then, when it came, it was so hot that she had to sit and look at it for a few minutes.  Luckily, we brought some applesauce for her to eat while sitting there.  When it was all said and done, she barely ate any of it because she got full from eating other things while waiting for her food to cool off.

I had the Seafood pasta and I was less than impressed.  The scallops were small and the shrimp had tails still so I had to pull them off before I could eat them with my pasta.  The red peppers in my pasta seemed as though they were from a can (watery with little taste) and the pasta was drenched in oil, so much so that there was a large pool of it at the bottom of my plate.  The taste was very generic and nothing impressive at all.

My son liked the pizza and my other guest enjoyed the sandwich (half a steak hoagie) she got.

I was very surprised by this encounter and will go back to see if the restaurant is more like our first or 2nd encounter.  Either way, when we do go back, I will post another review so fellow yelpers know my opinion from my follow up visit."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised with how many negative reviews this place has. Personally, I've been here about 10 times and never had a bad experience. The booze is modestly priced and the food is very good. And in a city with few late night dining options, Cenci's definitely hits the mark. I've never been here for Lunch or Dinner, so maybe their daytime service is poor. But if you're in the area and want some late night vittles, Cenci's hits the spot."}
{"text":"Had the Chicago deep dish. Very disappointed. Was only a round Sicilian crust with one layer of cheese and some plum tomatoes on top. We have had the real thin at pizza uno and Lou malnati's in Chicago so we know the difference. Was an awful attempt. The side salads were very small and again not very Italian. No chic peas, olives, peperocino. Just very generic.
A shame to call yourself an Italian restaurant. Service was good. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Overall bad experience.

Came on a Sunday for dinner when only one other table in the restaurant was filled. Waitress messed up the entire order, forgot to bring a lot of the food. She brought one of the appetizers out after we finished our dinner. The appetizer was undercooked because it was most likely forgotten and rushed.

Dinners were nothing special, one person at our table asked for their sauce of their pasta on the side and it never came.

Waitress kept disappearing even though one other table, would not recommend going on a Sunday night, hopefully it's better during other days of the week when it's busier? Probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered a sicilian style pizza with meatballs and banana peppers. I am sorry to say that the pizza was a step above what they used to serve at McKnight elementary school 20 years ago. It was institutional pizza at best.  The meatballs were obviously not homemade and reminded me of something you'd buy in a 20 pound bag frozen at Costco.   Overall very disappointed. 

Given all of the positive reviews on yelp I will give this place another shot  and will post a follow up."}
{"text":"I went to Cenci's for the first time last night as a result of a Groupon (which, based on reviews, they have offered consistently for over 2 years), and can say I wouldn't go again.  But, if you have a family with young children, this is the place for you.  Almost every table had at least one high chair, which meant lots of screaming, crying, and iPhones streaming video of kid's shows.  The service is fairly quick, but not friendly.  Pizza was just okay, and the wraps are very small for being $10+.  Overall, everything was just okay, and with how many pizza shops there are in the area, it isn't worth a return trip."}
{"text":"I ordered their one topping large pizza and wing special for $20 to-go and thought it was a solid value. I don't know why Pittsburgh's pizza falls short compared to lots of other cities, but that is reflected here. While there was nothing bad about it, it wasn't memorable. The sauce was ok and the crust was a bit flat in flavor. The wings we got were plentiful and the honey mustard flavor was pretty good. The chicken was over cooked (better over than under) but still enjoyable. Overall it was fine but it won't be on the top of pizza places to go for me."}
{"text":"I don't think there's anything special about Cenci's, I'm sorry to say.  Groupon brought me here twice during the last few months, but a meal here is not a mistake I'm willing to make a third time.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks that even below-average pizza is good/decent pizza, or at least I had that mindset before I came to Cenci's.  The pizza here is pretty awful--commercial spongy crust, presumably inexpensive and greasy cheese, you get the idea.  And it's not even that cheap, particularly if you want to get a little creative and add toppings or do the build-your-own thing.  Unfortunately I had pizza both times I came here because I wanted to give the pizza a second try and the rest of the average bar food menu didn't exactly call my name.

Service during my experiences was OK, as were the White Russians.  The place hasn't much personality, and the clientele is diverse."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Tuesdays ago with my fiance and another dining companion for dinner.  We arrived shortly after 7 PM to find the place packed.  The inside of Cenci's was quite dim with a bar straight ahead, a dining room to the left and a case filled with a ton of craft beer in it on the right.  We headed towards the dining area to see only a single table left which we quickly took.  Earlier in the day we had looked at their website to find out what the specials were and they happened to be $3.50 Craft drafts & $5.99 14\" cheese pizzas.  Whenever our server came over asked us what we would like to drink I asked what they had on draft.  She did not know off the top of her head and had to go to another table to find her handwritten list.  I ended up ordering a Terrapin I believe and by this time the rest of the table had decided that we would split 2 14\" pizzas between us.  Our food arrived to us in a reasonable amount of time and we dug into the pizza.  There was nothing special about the pizza and it sort of reminded me of a frozen pizza.  Boring crust that wasn't too crispy and some bland cheese and sauce that left all of us feeling unsatisfied.  As a matter of a fact if I was writing the review only on the food itself, I would have given it two stars.   What saved it was that our server was nice and polite and I liked the atmosphere of the place.  My fiance and I also noticed that they were starting some trivia as we were leaving which we may be interested in for the future.

The bottom line for me is that I might be back to Cencis in the future but certainly not for the food.  Their pizza was definitely lacking in something and all 3 of left the place unsatisfied."}
{"text":"When this place first opened I was a big fan of their chicken parm sandwich. Their pizza was pretty good too. However the last few times I have been there the food seems to be going down in quality and the last time I was there I became violently ill with food poisoning. If you do decide to eat here I'd make sure to stick to the pizza."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for Tuesday night Trivia for about a year now.  They have a good draft selection which is on special Tuesday and Thursdays.  It's a nice bar with an open concept and some pool tables in the back.  They have plenty of flat screen TVs and the staff is very friendly.

I usually get a sub or some type of pizza here.  Although their pizzas are a little thinner, they have some great specialty pizzas (buffalo chicken, steak and ranch being my favorites).  Subs are huge and come with a side of fries/chips.  Some of the food can be hit or miss though; I thought the lasagna was sort of bland.  

With a good selection of beer, good pizza and some awesome sandwiches I have no trouble coming back to this place. They are usually running deals on Groupon if you want to come check it out.  Really nice atmosphere for team trivia and they have some good events going on so check their calendar on the website."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! Thin and crispy with perfect amount of sauce and cheese. We look forward to bounceu parties for the pizza that is catered from here."}
{"text":"This is the second time my family and I have eaten here. We came for dinner, at the time it wasn't very busy. Our food took almost an hour to arrive, we all ordered simple dishes. Its was ok, everything tasted decent. My daughter got fries with her meal and they were delicious. The waitress came once to check on us towards the end of our meal. As she was asking \"how everything was, did we need anything?\" She walked away as we were trying to answer her that we wanted boxes. She actually started walking away as she was asking the question. She took forever to come back with our checks. We were done eating at least 20 minutes before she came over. When she finally did and went to check us out another employee  changed the TV to Jeopardy from lacrosse. She stopped ringing us out and for the next several minutes went to change the station back. This took several minutes for some reason. She stood right next to us messing with the remote in stead of the 2 seconds it would have taken to hand us our receipt to sign. She could have waited to change the channel. Completely ridiculous."}
{"text":"I've probably been here 10-12 times over the years. My kids love it, particularly the sugar puff dessert. I've never had a great meal but on several occasions I've had a dissatisfactory one. Today was the worst. I ordered a grilled chicken salad (no banana peppers). The salad arrived with the banana peppers. Since someone from the back delivered it he probably didn't realize I had ordered it without them but nbd I just pulled them out. In doing that I saw two fruit flies - one swarming above the dish and one literally crawling around the edge of the plate. I understand that happens so just shoo'ed them away and tried to pretend it didn't happen. The red onions were all slimy/ like mush. The chicken seemed fine so I decided to just eat that (since server was no where to be found anyway) and avoid the salad. When she did come over to see if I wanted a box I let her know about the flies and that the salad didn't seem fresh. She said \"ew gross! Sorry!\" And then went to get the bill.  she's right.  Gross. And now tonight I feel sick and have to wonder if it was the chicken that I paid $11.50 for that made me sick... 
truly no need to go here. I won't be back. We still have a Groupon for $50- free to anyone who wants to take the risk to go here to eat slimy onions, fruit flies and questionable chicken."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is usually horrible! You can hear the waitstaff and bartenders complaining about life..Location is also horrible!"}
{"text":"This review is on take-out only. We had a drug rep come into my office today, as we do 2-3 times a week, for a catered lunch and he brought Cenci's, which growing up in the Wexford area, I have wanted to try since it is relatively (a few years maybe) new to the area. He brought 2 pizzas-a pepperoni and a cheese-in addition to 2 full hoagies-an Italian and a steak. I opened up both pizza boxes and it looked absolutely revolting as in I truly have not seen pizza look so unappetizing in quite some time. So unfortunately I personally cannot rate the pizza on anything other than appearance but the crust was black the whole way around and the amount of grease pooling on the shriveled up pepperoni was disgusting. I ended up taking a 1/4 of the Italian hoagie and a 1/4 of the steak. The steak meat was dry as can be and burnt. I had to douse the 1/4 in ranch to make it edible. The bread was pretty hard and not as if it were toasted but as if it were stale (maybe in addition to being toasted). The Italian was the same deal-the only way it was edible was with Italian dressing on it (and I'm not a fan at all of Italian dressing but it was work and options were limited). Again, the bread tasted stale and was actually too hard to eat on this 1/4 hoagie. I attempted to dissect the meat from the 1/4 but seeing as there was only one sliver of pepperoni I decided that would be too much work and I just threw it away. I'm glad I was able to try the food for free because I had been planning on stopping into Cenci's pretty soon and I would have been utterly disappointed and feeling ripped off if I would have actually had to pay for any of the items the drug rep brought in today. I don't give many one star reviews but honestly, based on what I sampled and saw today, cannot give the food we received at the office more than one star."}
{"text":"After reading some of these reviews on the way to this restaurant, I thought I was going to have one heck of an experience.  

The pizza I ordered was over cooked and it was quite bland. Thank god for having Romano Cheese and Red Pepper Flake on the tables, or I would not have eaten the pizza. 

The 16oz draft beer I ordered came in a 12oz glass. To prove my point I pour a 12oz bottle of beer into that same glass and it barely fit. 

What I was impressed with was the service and the owner was able visit with all the patrons in the dining area. 

This place would be good for drinks and apps with friends or to catch a game on one of their many TV's. If you're looking for good pizza in Wexford; this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"Over-priced and nothing really stands out about any of the food.  The hot wings were just store bought hot sauce."}
{"text":"Cenci's is perfect for a late nite bite and beverage till 2 AM. Great food, music, big screen TVs. I hear they deliver till close. I thoroughly enjoyed my gnocchi (hold the melted cheese) and a Pino. Just before closing time, there was still a good crowd. Then a spontaneous dance contest broke out between a college brat -vs- a tipsy 30-something dude with moves that put Chris Brown to shame! I kid you not. Right there in the bar area. The whole place was cheering them on. Loved it. Say hi to owner Bobby & his barkeep girlfriend Shelly; and save a stool for me. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We only go for the trivia.  The food is not bad, but not really special.  As a sports bar they just don't get it.  E.g. They always have 2 adjacent TVs showing the exact same thing.  Yeah, most people may want to be watching the Pens, but there's no reason the TV right beside that one, can't be showing the Pirates, or even another hockey game."}
{"text":"Terrible delivery order. Fried mushrooms were cold and soggy. Forgot the blue cheese for wings. Awful"}
{"text":"Great fun atmosphere. They have a semi functioning pool table and dart board. There is a nice selection of beer and typical bar food. Pizza is very good! Tried the Cajun dry rub wings and there was no flavor. Maybe that was a one off... But everything else kind of made up for it."}
{"text":"Wings are good, sandwiches are respectable, but the pizza is way to greasy. I have been to cinci's numerous times because it's local and they do a decent job but on the occasions I've gotten pizza it's been overly greasy. Even drunk I have to bust out the paper towel to dab the excessive grease. I recommend it just not the pizzas."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Ally is our favorite bartender. Love the pizza. Food is affordable. Their garlic knots are amazing. The bar is huge. Ally makes a stiff and affordable drink. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Cencis is a neighborhood Italian style restaurant. The owner grew up in the area and shows every sign of a true commitment to Wexford. They have a dining side and a bar side. Both are clean and comfortable. Now to the food....We haven't tried too many things because we absolutely love their cheese steak sandwiches. We always order them with double meat.....and they are delicious. One sandwich and a salad can feed two people. I would rank Cencis double meat cheese steak on par with the best of Philadelphia.

I also like their Sicilian style pizza. Perfect combination of flavor, crunch and chewy."}
{"text":"Over priced, greasy food with little flavor and slow service. Why did I come from Pittsburgh to eat here? I've heard the owner is a jerk, so I didn't bother to complain, I just won't go back."}
{"text":"The food is great. The people friendly and I will be back. Just not sure when. I live in California and my in-laws live there. They will be back."}
{"text":"We decided to go here for dinner because we had a gift certificate from restaurant dot com, which this business subscribed to, to attract new customers with a discount incentive.  I purchased the certificate awhile ago, and wanted to make sure it was still valid at this establishment, so I checked the validity of the certificate on the restaurant dot com website.  Still valid.  So I made plans to go there.  We ordered dinner salads and pizza.  Total bill was $50.  A little high, but the certificate was for $25 with $35 minimum purchase, which made it worth it.
When we got the bill, I handed the waitress our certificate, and she immediately stated they do not honor or accept these anymore.  She told me there was a sign on the door, and was surprised we did not see it.
I was disappointed, due to ordering to meet minimum requirement, which now doesn't apply, and figured we must have missed something on the door and/or restaurant dot com website, notating validity of certificate.  Wrong on both accounts!  We checked the restaurant for signs telling patrons that the certificates were no longer accepted, and the restaurant dot com website and there was no sign on any doors or windows, and no invalid certificate message on site.  The waitress flat-out lied to us, and would not honor it.  Poor customer service!!!!  We still tipped well, because she did a decent job of serving our table, and we are decent people, but we will never come back, and will tell friends and family not to come here either.  I hope the owner sees this and makes it right.  I will adjust my review accordingly if they fix this and honor the certificate I spent money on for their restaurant."}
{"text":"I didn't visit this location as my brother ordered two medium sized pizzas to go.  We got one cheese and one with pepperoni.  I only tried the cheese one, but i have to say it was pretty good.  The pizza dough was slightly undercooked, but the sauce was flavorful and sweet.  There was a bit too much cheese on it, but it wasn't too bad.  Overall a decent pizza place.  I wouldn't mind ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I came to Cenci's with my son's soccer team to watch a World Cup game.  We ate lunch and I was very pleased with the Calzone I ordered. It was huge and very good.  The price was right.  The service was not the best that day, but to the servers credit, it was a crazy environment with lots of separate checks requested.  I will certainly be back with the entire family and check this place out further."}
