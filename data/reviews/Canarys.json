{"text":"Canaries restaurant my wife and I had been dining there since they open the only place we get breakfast lunch and dinner when we travel out the food is excellent the service is excellent Anna gives new meaning to the word hospitality and they work like a well oiled machine also it's nice to see the owner of a business getting involved great job Canaries restaurant keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now, once for breakfast and once for lunch, and will be returning again and again.  If you want fancy food or a more expensive meal, go elsewhere. This food is cheap and filling and the atmosphere of the restaurant is very friendly.  For breakfast, I had eggs, toast, hash browns and a ham steak.  All was cooked exactly as I like and the coffee was very good.  I just had to remind the waitress once that I was drinking decaf and I was set for the rest of the meal, no matter who came to the table to refill my cup.  The lunch I had was friend chicken (thigh, leg and breast) and was very tasty. The crunch of the coating was perfect and the chicken itself was very moist.  I had a garden salad with it, as well as fries and veggies. My only complaint with this meal was that the veggies were obviously canned, but considering the cost of the entire meal, I'm going to let that one pass.  I will definitely be going back to Canary's over and over again."}
{"text":"My family just went to Canary's for dinner and we loved it!  The reuben sandwich I ordered was delicious.  And you just can't beat the great service and low prices at this restaurant!  This is a must try!"}
{"text":"You know , despite how cheap Canarys is, I can't get over how bad the service and some plates are. NEVER order bacon from there, it is as good as salty paper. After bringing out my eggs which were scrambled instead of over easy, the server just asked if that was \"ok\" and didn't offer to fix it. Again though, it is extremely cheap, so if you just want some basic breakfast at a super low cost and you're within a 5 minute drive, it might be worth it."}
{"text":"The problem with these mom n' pop diners is that they're often inferior versions of the chain restaurants that they're supposed to be better than.  Everything for them comes out of a bag, or a box, or like the 'cream' is made of individual components that you would never consume.  No I'm not being pretentious, I like a good greasy spoon as much as the next guy, but these generic places need something that sets them apart from the half dozen Perkins knock-offs that I have to drive by to get there, and a plate of freezer-fries isn't going to cut it."}
{"text":"What do you get when you combine $7, the Backstreet Boys and fluffy pancakes? I don't know about you, but I think about Canary's in North Olmsted (because they play 80's and 90's pop music). I was frightened but fortunately, I avoided being \"Rick Rolled.\" For a diner, this place is king. Nothing special about the ambiance but friendly staff and designated coffee waitress.  I ordered the country fried steak, a customized vegetarian egg white omelette with green peppers, tomatoes, and as much spinach \"As God will allow\" and of course a side of pancakes. You also get a side order of toast, and I recommend you get the hashbrowns well done to make them crispy on top.   All of this food +2 coffees with free refills was only $18.85. That's WTF OMG pricing. Time for food arrival was 10 minutes and 13 seconds, not too bad... Not too bad."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not even WORTH  one  star, but I had no choice!  The owner of this dive is a nasty person!  My family of 14 (immediate, and aunts and uncles, nieces,nephews,and grandkids) went to this place for my wifes 67th birthday. She is currently going through chemotherapy and can't wait to long to eat. We had to wait almost 20 minutes to get waited on, when I asked the\" owner\"  what's taking so long, he was very rude and said\" a waitress will be there when she's not so busy\" . He could care less!  When we finally got our food, my wife took one taste of her meal, and could not eat it. Tasted like they dumped a whole salt shaker in the sauce ...after telling the \"owner\"  , and asking him to take it off the bill, he said \"I can't afford to give food away \"and wouldn't do anything about it! His menu states \"10% discount for seniors \", however wouldn't do it for us because my meal was under $4.00 , he insulted  me and embarrassed me in front of my family saying  \" he would be ashamed to ask for a discount\"  Needless to say, I will NEVER, EVER go back to this establishment!  I hope this GUY gets what's coming to him."}
{"text":"I came back,  the owner replaced the knives with wood handled ones.   I am happy that he listened."}
{"text":"I know this review is a little late since they just had a major fire but I just had to show my love for this place. The food was so delicious. The people so welcoming and nice. The prices were great. The portions great. You never left hungry. They had great coupons. I hope they rebuild. This place is part of North Olmsted and is loved by many."}
{"text":"Diner food, decently priced and they make it pretty fast! Its about the only place to get breakfast around there too."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. And a great value! Sausage and biscuit gravy was great.  The Mexican skillet was even better.     The sausage omelette needs a little work."}
{"text":"Visited on 4/24/14.  Service was very good.  Food was very tasty and proporations were more than ample. A great value."}
{"text":"Ordinary, clean, friendly, standard, no negatives, for the hungry.  This place is jello so do not expect Creme Brûlée.  If you are surrounded by snow and cold, come here to be filled with food your grandmother would make for you in the midst of deep winter in Cleveland - and you might see her working here too.  The eggs are proper and made to order and the servers are polite, except for the standard excessive refilling of my coffee to scalding temperatures."}
{"text":"I frequent this place almost weekly as I have family that are regulars. I will try my best to not be biased in my review as I feel I may receive better service due to the owner and servers knowing me.   This is a very typical diner when it comes to very simple food at a good value, mainly targeting the senior population.   The price is very fair, for the portions and quality you couldn't expect it to be any less expensive. This is the sort of place you come to get what you'd expect. With the price  you can't expect a designed interior, you can't expect high quality ingredients, and you can't expect the servers to be perfect. They are great to me, constantly checking up and refilling my coffee, but they are usually busy and sometimes slightly disorganized. The menu is decently diverse, I stick to a few staples and they are always consistent. Not too salty, not too bland, things are well-cooked and simple. The restaurant is always clean, especially the bathrooms, and generally I would assume the kitchen is as well. The owner is great and always around, he will even take your order and serve salads himself often. Generally this place is well-run and worth the try if you are looking for a simple meal at a good value.   I give this place 5 stars because I've never been disappointed, it's not going to impress you, but you will never be let down. A true staple to the west side suburbs and I hope it's here to stay."}
{"text":"Good food, average service, no wait, extensive menu!"}
{"text":"This place has good breakfast and you get a lot for your money. The food for the prices they have is excellent. But if you want grander food, go were you have to pay more.  Some people are never happy and expect for a little money T Bone and more expensive food. I call them cheap Charlie's. For a breakfast if you want to pay more, go to Bob Evans, which is double the price. The Waffle is outstanding and way better at Canaries, then at Bob Evans at double the price."}
{"text":"Prices are inexpensive and service is quick and friendly. So far the food I've tried is so-so. I ordered ribs, which were really ordinary, just ribs baked in an oven and topped with bar-b-q sauce. Onion rings are not crisp. Fries are the frozen variety that come out soggy. Vegetable sides appear to be canned. Lots of seniors here and we know they like it bland and soft."}
{"text":"4.5 for value and service. To get a read about this place,...when you arrive at opening time all of the handicapped spots are full of cars and there are people finishing their meals already inside. I.e. Really appeals to the Cue tip crowd. There's nothing wrong with that, but you get the picture.   Home style food at very low prices. No surprises."}
{"text":"So glad North Olmsted has another breakfast option.  I've been to Canary's twice now and both times the food has been pretty good.  I wouldn't say excellent, but it's good.  Prices are super cheap, so I can handle OK food as long as it's cheap.  The menu is HUGE and personally, I don't care for menu's with a million things.  I have a hard time deciding between 5 things, I don't need 500.  I guess if your someone who likes tons of options, then this is great, but if not then beware!  I ended up ordering way more then I could eat, eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, toast and pancakes, like I said the menu is huge and I just couldn't decide or find 1 meal that had some of what I wanted. You will more then likely spend 15 minutes reading and deciding, just on your breakfast.  First visit service was excellent (evening) second visit took forever.  We waited about 40 minutes for our breakfast. I understand morning is breakfast time and their going to be busy, but isn't speedy service part of the business? I just can't wait that long for eggs! Overall, I like Canary's, but I wouldn't go back early morning for breakfast, just not worth the wait.  I probably could have cooked, ate and cleaned up my own kitchen in the time it took them to make it."}
{"text":"In Cleveland this place was absolutely awesome!!! Now I am speaking for breakfast only for this review. Service was fast and friendly and the prices were excellent. I can't  imagine any better place in the area for breakfast. Go for it"}
{"text":"I like Canary's a lot. It's better than most, but it could be better - and I want to see it happen. Hope the owner is reading this because I am a regular and a fan!  Here's the deal:  The first great thing about Canary's is that it's CLEAN. For a modern-day restaurant, you really do feel like they kicked it up a notch in the cleanliness department. And that's so important. So, right off the bat that makes me a fan.   The second great thing about Canary's? Canary's is CHEAP. Like, a huge Canary's breakfast is probably one third ... that's right, ONE THIRD, the price of the same breakfast at some fast food chain like Bob Evans.  And the food is decent - where a place like Bob Evans has that super-processed chemical factory-made feeling, at Canary's you feel like you're getting a decent meal.   Friendliness of staff is another great thing about the place - I love the waitresses here, they work so hard and they're so nice. They're not Bob Evans robots here, these people actually care. The waitresses are awesome here, they're so attentive - I think they get an award for the best coffee service, because they never let your coffee go empty (as for the one review here that actually COMPLAINS about that, my suggestion lady is DON'T ORDER COFFEE! Us coffee drinkers appreciate the bottomless cup!)  Ok, where Canary's can use improvement? I think they've gotten skimpier with stuff in the past year. The bacon is super tasty, but the slices are as thin as prosciutto that someone stretched out with a weinerschnitzel press. The hash browns used to be enormous and I think they're gradually cut them down to half (and haven't been cooking them as long). If you get there at the right time the coffee is awesome, but 7 times out of 10 it tastes like the grounds have been used too many times. And I think they could put in some specials in their breakfast menu, maybe add some healthy things with fruit or mediterranean staples or something like quinoa, and definitely get on some gluten free options. If you are gluten free there's nothing here for breakfast at all, and very little for dinners, and that's enough to keep a lot of my friends out. I bend the rules a bit but I end up paying for toast that I can't even eat. I would happily pay $1 for gluten free toast or for some other option besides the plain toast. They added music, and it's a bad idea, it's annoying - they play it a little too loud.  So bottom line, the food is skimping out a wee bit and they could use some modern health conscious / gluten free specials, but it's still a great place that you need to check out!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! My parents and I love going here for breakfast a few times a month. The food is delicious, the staff go above and beyond and are always checking to see if customers need refills on coffee or other beverages. The prices cannot be beat!! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Canary's Family Restaurant is now the third incarnation of the cursed 27350 Lorain Road location following Rosie's and Vienna Deli.  Of those three, Canary's is the worst (though Rosie's wasn't far behind) with its ho hum menu of low quality food.  The Chicken Noodle Soup came in a modest sized bowl of broth and plenty of noodles, but only scant traces of chicken and vegetables.  The Fried Chicken with Baked Potato was three pieces of chicken--two of which, the drumstick and the wing, were no bigger than pizza chain buffalo wings.  The chicken was way overcooked and dry inside with the only positive point being a vague hint of spice in the breading.  The baked potato was passable, though automatically topped with an (un)healthy scoop of butter.  Prices are fairly cheap, but you are going to get cheap food in return.  On top of all this, when one of the elderly customers (there are many) crapped his or her pants, I learned that the atmosphere wasn't just painted on the walls."}
{"text":"Great service - great omelettes! Been going to the one by 150th for years. This place is closer to home and has great prices and  fast service"}
{"text":"Tried their breakfast on a Saturday morning. Wow!  Big place, great price, great food, and FAST!  I can't believe I've never stopped in before!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for haute cuisine, you have to go elsehwhere.  But North Olmsted needed this restaurant.  For years Rosie's seerved customers good basic family food, while providing a place for people to gather and talk.  When Rosie's went out several wanna bees came in and failed miserably.  Canary's is near city hall and the library, so sooner or later everyone in the city of a political bent passes through.  From the location alone it should do well.  The sandwiches are good basic fare. They are served appropriately hot or cold in a timely manner.  I had the Ruben and it was a solid Cleveland Ruben with about an inch of meat.    Your drink will never hit bottom -- refills on coffee and tea are automatic and served with a smile.  In fact everybody on the staff is friendly.    The restaurant seems to have caught on - as it should.  Welcome, Canary's."}
{"text":"Love this place. Husband and I ate dinner and breakfast there and we are very impressed. Food was wonderful . Service was very good and the employees make you feel so welcome. Lovely place with a Home like atmosphere. The kindness of everyone was wonderful. Very clean . Plan on making this our go to place."}
{"text":"Had time before leaving for airport. This gem was a short drive from hotel. Great food and great service. Prices are very reasonable. Great breakfast stop!"}
{"text":"Growing up eating canary for breakfast is a tradition. Affordable and good quality of food. Very home like welcoming atmosphere. No flaws."}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant... I stopped by here for a quick bite on a Friday morning. The parking lot was full, but I still managed to find a spot. Because of the parking area, I expected a bit of a wait before I would be seated. Nope? I was pleasantly surprised to find myself seated with a cup of coffee and my order placed within about 10 minutes!   The restaurant is really nothing to look at, in fact I found myself thinking that it almost looked a bit dirty. However, my food arrived in about 10 minutes and was quite delicious. I ordered 2 eggs, country scrambled sausage gravy and biscuits and I was pleased. The gravy looked a bit odd to me at first because I'm used to Bob Evans sausage gravy and theirs isn't like that. But after one bite, I was hooked!   The only reason I gave them a 4 star instead of 5 is because I felt the place looked a bit dirty. But, even with that being said, I would still come back here again. The food was THAT good!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  Fast service, good menu and good tasting food, affordable, nice caring staff, and immaculately clean!  Why go to a ripoff national chain, where you will pay at least twice as much, and often get smaller portions?  Family Restaurants and Diners are a much better value by far!"}
{"text":"Canarys isn't new it's a west park tradition/institution. This restaurant is the 2nd one. The first is located in westpark and i've frequented it for a long time. If you're one of those weirdo people that expect everything you order to be a perfect 10 then go to a 5star restaurant or go home and cook it yourself. Canarys is great because #1 it's suppppppeeeeerrrrrr inexpensive and  #2 you don't have to do the cooking. If you don't like this place then you're a food snob elitist. The staff that treats me like family and the 2x4 for breakfast keep me going back again and again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Came the first time based on a review by flight attendants.  Keep coming back when in Cleveland.  Great food, really nice waitstaff, comfortable surroundings.  Make sure you bring cash!"}
{"text":"This was delicious home cooking. Breakfast is served all day so that's what I ordered at noon. It came out quickly and hot.  I ordered the farmers skillet. The sausage gravy was delicious.  Staff was friendly and welcoming. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The food was good, price was awesome and my server was really nice. The food came out really fast. Foodies don't belong here.... This is where you come to get decent home cooked food that's likely smothered in brown graVy.   I wanted to leave this review because the 'hostess' was horrible. Unfriendly and mumbled as she sat me. She was tring to get everyone's drink orders before they were even at their table. Maybe that's what old people prefer?   Then at the end, my waitress took the check up, but same 'hostess' brought it back to me... And stood there while I added my tip and signed it. I made a comment that is never had anyone wait for me to sign the bill like that and she waved my copy at me like she was holding it hostage. 'Its just easier this way'  No dear, it's just tackier that way."}
{"text":"Our favorite place every time we visit OH. Traditional breakfast we love and always get great service. See you next time :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and very reasonable prices.  They keep your coffee  cup full before you even have to ask for a warmer or refill. Plenty of attention to each table and it's obvious your business is appreciated. Like a NYC diner experience."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and you can walk in and get a seat immediately. The prices are fantastic and the food quality is great, the service is super fast! The coffee is pretty basic, I'd love for a breakfast place to offer more higher end coffee's. I've not been there for dinner or lunch so I'm not sure how the food is for those times, this is only a Breakfast review*. The Farmers Skillet & the country fried steak are my two favorite meals Canary's offers, you get a high quality meal with a lot of food for a great price."}
{"text":"You know, I want to like this place better than I did.  There's nothing really bad about it, but there's nothing really outstanding about it, either. I had a country fried steak for breakfast, and it was good...the eggs were good, the hash browns were good, the biscuit was...well, it wasn't so good.  The service was fine, the price was fine, but there's nothing that makes it stand out to me."}
