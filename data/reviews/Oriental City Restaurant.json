{"text":"You get a huge serving. I got a combo with chop suey and fried rice (it came with breaded shrimp and wonton soup) and could not finish it. I loved the chop suey! Would be 5 stars if there was a bigger drink selection?"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, big portions,and the best prices. Delivery is fast,and the driver is always super sweet. Try the bacon friend rice! Too good :) their spring rolls are very tasty, food is piping hot when it arrives.also try the chicken appetizer, the one with bacon-if you like deep fried stuff that is.now i am hungry."}
{"text":"Parents ordered from here tonight and wow I'm really disappointed. First they didn't deliver the whole order and by the time we were done they still hadn't brought the rest. Secondly,  the food was beyond gross. It was all greasy and tasteless and left a bad after taste.  Mc Donald's would be a better choice than this place."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem. They have the best live lobsters to choose from and the prices are so very affordable. The food quality is excellent and the service is excellent. This is the best place in all of Toronto."}
{"text":"Got greasy and crappy. I am not sure what it takes to get a chinese meal that doesn't taste like oil mixed soy sauce anymore. I give up."}
