{"text":"I ordered takeout for lunch one day and got the marinated charbroiled chicken rice plate. It was pretty good. It came with plenty of rice and a nice crisp salad with a very flavorful dressing. My only complaint is a lot of rice and not much chicken or salad. They also provided a sauce for the sticky rice,but it was still just a lot of rice left after I ate my chicken. I may order again, but for $9 just wish there was more to it. Probably better off actally eating in than a carry out."}
{"text":"Great local Vietnamese food.  Wife loves the Pho.  All I eat is the shaken beef.  Bar staff remembers everyone, and treats them like friends.  This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place.  But had a horrendous experience all around... Staff was woefully inept and over their heads.  Food came out 40 minutes later and was burnt & inedible.  We will not be back.  Very sad to see yet another restaurant fail so early...  good luck to them."}
{"text":"I love this place! The owners Ty and Hue are a blast and treat you like family. The bartender, Xenia,  is delightful. You must try the special of grandma's grape leaf wrapped tenderloin! The spring rolls are super fresh and delicious. I've never had anything I didn't like here. It's always a great time at Slanted!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pho and Lemongrass wings! Prices are very reasonable, we paid $34 for three apps and two beers during happy hour. Seriously though, get the wings!!!!"}
{"text":"My coworker discovered this place & brought me on a recent work trip to AZ. Atmosphere is very sleek and modern, although I will say the nightclub-esque lighting on the ceiling seemed a bit out of place for a place that's open for lunch. Food was good, but a bit bland, which was easily fixed with the variety of spicy sauces they had to offer. We tried the pho, crunchy rice in a clay pot & curry dishes (the vegetarian version of each). Service was friendly & attentive. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is my first time n will be my last time, came here with my family. Pho taste very nasty n high price, the veggies is not fresh, prices is too high. Will not come back"}
{"text":"Not your average Vietnamese restaurnant. Worth 5 stars but we had to wait an hour. They had 3 big tables came in before us and apologized.  Enjoyed specialty spring rolls and pho.  We will definitely be back when we are in town."}
{"text":"If you enjoy overpriced, mediocre Vietnamese food, all while the owners are secretly insulting you from 10 feet away, this place is for you!   First the food, which I give 3 stars: We got the pork spring rolls, which were okay but could have used more flavor. I got the vegetarian pho, which was decent, and my girlfriend got the combination pho. Her dish was pretty flavorless, and the meat didn't seem very fresh.  And now for the owners, which I give 0 stars. To our face they were extremely kind and welcoming. Had I been there on my own I would have walked out with a great vibe. But, my girlfriend happens to be fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese, and apparently the owners were too dumb to realize that an Asian customer might be able to speak their language. They were standing behind the bar, 5 feet away from us, and spent most of their time talking about the customers. They made multiple rude comments about the interracial couples in the restaurant, including some about the family sitting next to us. I won't go into other details, but let's just say I was pretty angry after hearing them.   (EDIT: While there I clearly heard a guy behind the bar telling another customer that he was from Shanghai, so I find it hard to believe that nobody there speaks Mandarin.)  There are better Vietnamese restaurants in Scottsdale...do yourself a favor and avoid these guys."}
{"text":"Our visit to the Slanted Rice in Scottsdale was our first experience with Vietnamese Cuisine and what a memorable experience it was! Outstanding service, ambiance   and fresh, delicious food prepared and served in a most appealing way is what you will find there! The lemongrass roasted brussels are a perfect start! So flavorful and roasted with an amazing lemon flair! Hubby had the shrimp rolls served on a stick with a tasty dipping sauce and really enjoyed this appetizer as well! We also sampled the vegetarian and shrimp pho and fell in love with the freshness and flavors of this wonderful soup.   I chose a cold rice vermicelli noodle dish with veggies, fresh mint, cucumbers, lettuce, peanuts and a variety of spices and sauces that you can add and then toss the whole thing together! One word- Amazing!!! I was in total vegetarian Heaven the whole time we were there! My husband had the charbroiled pork and rice which was quite tasty and he really enjoyed it.   The owner came out to chat with us and gave some suggestions on where to visit during our stay, she was adorable and very gracious. We are so glad to have visited this hip, immaculately clean and very well managed spot in beautiful Scottsdale! Of course we are on a quest for more Vietnamese food now that we have returned to Florida and I surely hope that they can stand up to the Slanted Rice!"}
{"text":"Tried there shaken beef last night, three words ! Tender, Juicy ! And Amazing! The tenderloin comes over sizzling over Carmelized onions. The staff there is really awesome as well, cute little neighborhood restaurant, seems like the staff knows all its customers and makes everyone feel at home, this will be my new rotation of restaurants to go to!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the place very nice in side and the service was great and very friendly. I ordered the salt and pepper calamari, shishito pepper, and small pho for appetizer. The salt and pepper calamari gets it 1 star tasted like frozen fish sticks. The shisito peppers 2 stars just ok. The pho was 4 star which was very good and flavorful nice portion as well. For dinner the wife and I ordered the garlic noddles and prawns and they were 2 star nothing special very bland and noodles were over cooked. We also ordered the Crispy Rice in a Clay Pot- Tenderloin that was 1 star it tasted like cheap beef teriyaki from grocery store. I really wanted to like this place because the service was great and so friendly. I would back for pho but nothing else"}
{"text":"It's pho'ing awesome! We're regulars. Love the owners.   Great happy hour on awesome food.   Leave feeling full by not gross.   Must try if you like any Asian cuisine,  you'll be an instant convert."}
{"text":"We are such PHO snobs!  I cannot tell you how impressive the menu was! The menu had an eclectic menu of various spring rolls and multiple options for pho. The atmosphere is so fun: adorable chandeliers and private booths. The service is wonderful and we were beyond impressed with the menu! If you love pho, you'll love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This local joint is so rad.  The food is great and they have a good happy hour too.  The owner comes by and says hi and they play fun techno music.  They let me bring my dog on the patio...my dog also loves this place"}
{"text":"Frequently do take-out from here. Food is excellent. Love the salad and soup that comes with the meals. Shaken beef is my favorite! The PHO is awesome as well! Fast service and very friendly staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great unique atmosphere, quality food.  Veggie curry was excellent but expensive.  Beef pho was excellent as well.  Pretty expensive menu overall, though happy hour appetizer specials will likely bring me back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very warm and friendly. This would be a great date night place. The food was very good and served piping hot. Loved this place and will be back to try something else."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant and we drive 20 minutes to get there.  My husband likes spicy but I can't do it and they have options for both. The sweet chicken curry is amazing!! All the dishes are great. My husband loves the spicy sauces available. We bring friends frequently or we sit at the bar once in a while and watch a football game and I pick up to go when I'm in the area.  Always great. Staff (including owner) friendly. Food comes out in timely manner.  Good wine options."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with good ambience and GREAT service.  I'm a gastronomic snob particularly when it comes to food of my Motherland (I'm Viet).  I also live in Westminster California near the heart of Little Saigon.  Coming to Scottsdale for a business trip, I didn't want to go to a Viet restaurant because I was afraid of being disappointed.  However, local colleagues insisted so here we were.  Very pleasantly  surprised at the quality and variety and creativity of the food presented.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is white people Vietnamese food. I don't mind paying more for good food but when the food is not good it puts me in a foul mood.   I work next door and was excited that a Vietnamese restaurant was opening up next to me.  I ordered take out a few times and the food sucked. I thought maybe it's take out and the food was not hot enough or got soggy.  So I finally was able to go after work.  Their happy hour is a joke but I guess this place is not known for the happy hour.  Got a bunch of Apps and the lemongrass Brussels sprouts was good.  Calamari only 4 pieces came out and they try to mask it with a bunch of fried onions. I swear I thought I was at Outback Steakhouse and ordered the blooming onion.  Ordered the Pho, I could have gone home and opened a can of Swanson chicken broth , added noodles , meat and made a better pho than this place.  But I guess they are going for the bland white people Vietnamese food to cover the rent.  Can't blame anyone but myself for suggesting to eat here."}
{"text":"Slanted Rice is locally owned by a husband and wife duo. The owners are so down to earth, make sure to take the time check on their customer's experience, and will even serve if short! Their food is on point. The garlic butter edamame, pho, and sizzling steak dish is to die for. There is also a shrimp and noodle dish I've seen that I'm dying to try on the next visit. The food is GREAT! We always enjoy our dinner/evening thoroughly when we visit. Good job Slanted Rice!"}
{"text":"One word - disappointed. But not unexpected. After all, it's in the middle of Scottsdale.   I love Vietnamese food and I consider myself a veteran - I've tried many Vietnamese restaurants in town. Their food is mediocre to say the best, and pricey as everyone else mentioned. I'd tolerate that if their service is good. But no. We waited for 45 minutes for two simple lunch specials and when they finally came, my order was wrong.   We are not going back for sure."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place a negative star rating.  Can't say how the food was as we never received out order and after 50 minutes left.  I left $5 on the table to cover drinks/egg rolls the waitress came out and I said we're leaving and she said \"I'll comp your egg rolls\" and pocketed the $5!!  That was not a tip I see this as theft.  I hope the owner/manger checks these reviews  there is a blood heavy girl waitress that needs to be fired.  I have left a message for owner/manager.  Hope I hear back from them  BTW everyone around us who had different wait staff received their food ate and paid before we left...so it was the kitchen but the waitress."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars, if I could. They barely deserve 1 star because of their awful customer service. One pompous waiter with an accent is the worst offender. The first time my bf went here, Julian ignored him until my bf went to the bar. The second time we got an Asian bartender who was okay. We went there about two more times, always sitting at the bar since table service was lacking. Unfortunately, the fourth time we sat at the bar, the bartender was talking to other female servers and paying more attention to their conversation than the bar. I could hear the girls giggling and talking about doing Cocaine. I understand that people do drugs, but the fact that they discussed it so blatantly at work is not appropriate. They were more focused on dimwitted conversation than their jobs.                                                             So the next time we sat, we tried a table again. The restaurant was practically empty, and nobody came to help us. No one even sat us, and nobody brought water or said anyone would be with us. I could see the employees standing and chatting in the back completely oblivious. When we walked out, my bf was so upset I hung back to say something. The egocentric Julian, denied that we had been waiting there, did not apologize for anything and acted like he was god's gift to women. I honestly don't know what this guy's issue is but he's clueless and definitely should not be a server. He has no idea how to handle customers or even say the right thing. He just has \"slime ball\" written all over him. I have never met a more rude server.      As for the food, it's mediocre. I've had way better Vietnamese food at many other places in AZ.                                                                        I love spring rolls and the ones here are bland. I also tend to gravitate towards lemongrass and curry dishes. The curry was just like any other curry I've had elsewhere. And the lemongrass dish was a huge disappointed. It did not taste authentic at all, more importantly it wasn't good. The garlic noodles that come with the prawns are oily and slathered in too much butter. The noodles were stringy and lacked flavor. Of course this is not the worst Vietnamese food I'll ever have, but it definitely is nothing special. The only thing I ever liked was the calamari.              The pho at Tea Light Cafe is just as good as this one and there is actually real customer service at Tea Light Cafe. Imagine that! Customer service at a restaurant!                                   I am speaking from experience as I have been a server. I know it is not an easy job but whoever is hiring these \"employees\" needs to step up their game or clean house. The awful service is the main reason I am never going back here again.                                                       But, if you decide you're okay with rude servers talking about their drug habits, get the calamari; it's the only thing you could be happy with ordering."}
{"text":"Food is very good - a bit higher for Vietnamese but worth it for the venue and the food - love the décor - service a bit slow but they just opened so we will try again - we love this type of fresh Asian food - thanks - we made it to the movie on time for hubby's birthday last Monday."}
{"text":"Make sure you eat there! If you order to go you will get treated like a complete different person. They first off lie to you by telling you it'll be well over an hour for a to go order when it's dead inside so you will eat there. And the bartenders are very rude to you while you wait for you sit and wait for your order.  It's unfortunate because the food was good but we will not be going back after how awful the service was. Gave it a couple tries and it was the same. Hope they work on it."}
{"text":"We went to Slanted Rice this past Friday night. I was excited to go knowing that one of the owners was once the chef at Banzai, a sushi place I used to love on Northern and 12th street (now closed). First off, this place isn't your typical Vietnamese restaurant. It's a little bistro style restaurant with a hip atmosphere and a diverse and edgy menu. We started with lemon grass wings and lemon grass brussel sprouts. The wings were fantastic and the person at the table who hates sprouts was the one who insisted on a second order! For dinner we had the steak and the chicken. The entrees came with a small soup and salad, the soup was pho of course. I frequent Vietnamese restaurants around the valley and I have to say their pho was the most flavourful I've ever had. The steak and chicken were both absolutely delicious. I fairly sure I'm going for the steak again on my next visit. I had a cocktail recommended by the staff, don't know what it was called but they said it was the house signature drink, it was made with Jameson and blueberries. I definitely recommend trying one if you go, it was great. I can't comment on price as we were guests and were treated, but the menu prices looked very reasonable. Even though this place is not near where I live, it's worth the trip, I'll be heading back very soon."}
{"text":"Outstanding service but food quality is inconsistent. I've eaten there several times and sometimes it's excellent and others its average at best. A couple times I had very overcooked shrimp (almost burnt) and noodles had a stale taste. Very nice servers and management. I wish them the best but they need more oversight of the kitchen which I think is cutting corners."}
{"text":"My second time here (plus one to go order) and I love it as much as the first. I've now had the lemongrass rice lunch plate with chicken, the garlic sauce wings, some pork spring rolls, and the beef pho. I have not been disappointed with anything and most of these items came from recommendations from their friendly staff. Very cute, modern decor. Love the music. Drink selection is very nice and I'm glad they support local breweries. The best part is that the things you wouldn't typically find in a Vietnamese restaurant have been knock outs! ie the chicken wings. Everything has a certain flair so it stays true to the concept.   I really love the staff. They are knowledgable and friendly and very welcoming. Keep it up Slanted Rice! I am hooked."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find a Vietnamese option while visiting Phoenix, but I was pleasantly surprised.   Sllanted Rice is a fairly intimate place, but comfortable. I found the service was good too. Like many others I tried the Crispy rice in Clay pot with Chicken. Wow! It was very hot, almost too hot. The rice reminded of Persian rice or burnt rice in a good Paella. Once I the dish cooled down enough to eat I really enjoyed the bok choy, the shitake mushrooms and the sauce. The chicken was kind of plain, but that could be my fault. I bet the veggie version is worth trying.   The price was right too."}
{"text":"Just called, now they DO NOT take reservations, but have a call ahead model, so YELP is incorrect in saying they take reservations. That needs to be updated. Have had issues with past reservations, them not being aware after being made, so this may be more realistic. Great food, very nice atmosphere, but operationally there are lots of issues, but helps that they are all super nice staff/owners."}
{"text":"Came here last night and we were very impressed with the service and food. I love that they have a smaller portion size of pho--about 1/4 to 1/3 of the traditional size pho (just $6). Most places don't do that! It was just the right size for me. They also have a lot of other things on the menu that I want to try so I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. The bar is legit. I always get Pho Togo but tonight I got a glass of wine and and dragon lady spring rolls while sitting with my Togo Pho. I changed my mind last minute and wanted to eat something here. It's busy for a Sunday night in Scottsdale and everyone here seems like a regular or a family/couple who's trying out a new place. The service is great and they all have really fun personalities. I always come here alone. Note to self: bring people and eat ALL of the food."}
{"text":"Lots of vegan options, which made me very happy. The pho was super yummy and flavorful, and the spring rolls were fresh and delicious. We came with a small dog and they were very accommodating, even bringing out a bowl of water for him. The patio was lovely. Service was great!"}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Arizona!  Pho soup is flavorful and perfectly balanced.  Summer Rolls are perfect for any day. Excellent homemade peanut sauce."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant with GREAT service and great food. Every time I have been the wait staff have been so attentive and so nice. My favorite thing is the crispy rice clay pot with either shrimp or scallops .. I love their pho as well! Every entree comes with a salad/soup duo that is so delicious! Highly recommend this little neighborhood gem to everyone!"}
{"text":"Love this place's, food, feeling and service. Treated like family. Fun atmosphere!  By far, best wings in town!!!!!!  If you love crispy sweet wings, this is the place. Highly recommend Slanted Rice."}
{"text":"This place is about as Vietnamese as I am. If you're looking for authentic pho, look elsewhere! They use a tepid, thin, flavorless vegetarian \"broth\" for the base of their pho. Their fried chicken app was lower quality than fast food. Service was poor as well. Even after we reminded them that we didn't get our soup and salad before the main entree, they still brought it out with the main dish. The waitress seemed put off by my questions about the food before I ordered, not knowledgable and proud of what they make. The assistant food runners slammed dishes down in front of us hastily and practically ran away, which was odd because they weren't particularly busy. And is it just me, or does the name of this place sound racist?"}
{"text":"Come here all the time and never leave dissatisfied. Best pho in Arizona! If you come here ask for Chloe, she knows everything about the menu and has to be one of the best servers I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Slanted Rice . . . and I was in Seventh Heaven!  What a beautifully designed space . . . and very comfortable!  I love the outside patio decor as well.   They offer a special lunch menu, but you can order off the main menu as well. There are so many choices from appetizers, salads, spring rolls, sandwiches, rice dishes, and dinner entrees. We had a difficult time deciding as we watched orders being delivered to other tables around us. Everything coming out of the kitchen looked amazing and fresh! Hubby and I decided to split two different spring rolls -- the Shrimp and Pork with peanut sauce and the Fried Tofu with peanut sauce. I have to say, they really know how to do peanut sauce!  Hue, one of the owners, also brought out some miso sauce to try as well with the rolls, and that was delicious as well!  Definitely many more rolls in our future.  We split the Crispy Rice in Clay Pot with chicken as our main entree. It was hands down the most tasty rice dish I have ever had. (And I am not a fan of rice to begin with!)  It also comes with a large bowl of soup and a good-sized salad. Definitely enough to share, but next time, I will order one just for myself. I almost inappropriately licked the bowl!!!  The owners Hue and Ty are very gracious and welcoming. I have already decided to have another lunch here later this week, and can't wait to bring in another group of friends for dinner so that we can experience more of everything!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service ever. I go to hole in the wall places that have way better everything. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I take pride in searching out the best Pho all over the country and I'll try as many places as possible. Slanted Rice ranks at a 7 for their Pho, which is pretty good as I am really picky on rating, but their service and other food like Dragon Lady, Tropical spring rolls & the fried banana & ice cream dessert are great! It's definitely a fancy than most Vietnamese restaurant and Pho takes longer than normal to come out. Staff was great! And overall a good experience. Would def recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Second time back here on work travel. Came here a few weeks ago with a friend from work & we really enjoyed it. This time on work travel solo came here for lunch & the place was packed. Even with it being so busy the staff was very attentive. Jasmine tea + lunch special of tofu (under the lemongrass lunch specials), soup and salad was fabulous. Last time I was here the shrimp spring roll with peanut sauce stood out. Will definately be back again & I hope this place becomes a staple in N. Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Holy. Mother. Of. God.  Shaken beef & clay pot of chicken. You just order both of these!! Make sure to mix the lime with the salt and pepper next to the beef to make it an amazing dipping sauce.  The interior of this place is mod and chic. Service is always great. This is a great spot for a date night. Their cocktails are well made. Shishito peppers are also the bomb!  The end!"}
{"text":"The ambience here is relaxing. Their spring rolls are amazing and unique. Their wings and salt and pepper shrimp are also good. My favorite part is their Pho, which have the best broth and meet. Service could be better but the food is completely worth it. My favorite place for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"My favorite asian food place in town!  Great staff and menu.  A must go for anyone that loves asian food!  Ive had the beef pho shaken beef, clay pot beef and firecracker shrimp each one is amazing."}
{"text":"Probably the best Pho north of Indian School.  We typically have to drive down to get good Pho.  Place is clean, ambiance is good, and great service.  Broth was flavorful and spring rolls with peanut sauce was great too.  Will be back for sure to try some of their other menu items (clay pot, and lemon grass dishes)."}
{"text":"not sure what to think of this place the food was good but not that much flavor really Americanized it was just missing something the service was OK but for price of the food you would expect better the firecracker shrimp was the best of what we had but over all not bad will go go back try some of the other things"}
{"text":"When I have a craving for Pho I go to Slanted Rice! Not only is the atmosphere and staff amazing but so is there food!!! If your not in a Pho mood try the firecracker shrimp with garlic noodles... To die for!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. It was a Tuesday night and not busy, and it took over one hour to get our pho. Plus, the server never apologized or explained AND brought two in our party their pho before mine and mine 20 minutes later. Food quality is great (some of the best pho in the Valley) but this terrible service really makes me question another visit."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  We got the chicken and rice noodles, combo pho, and egg rolls.  So yummy and it was ready for pick up 15 minutes from when I called."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Pho is my go to dish. Portions are huge! Staff is friendly and quick. I get it to go as well and they do a nice job so the broth doesn't spill by the time I get home."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai/Vietnamese food we ever had!! And we were visiting from N.Y. The ambience was beautiful and our server was the best ever!! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"It's ok. I liked what I ate but I'd drive a little further for a different Vietnamese restaurant that offered better food at better prices. Also loud in the evenings, but perhaps I just don't like that sort of ambience."}
{"text":"I was famished after my day hike up Piestawa peak and was craving some Vietnamese food. Slanted Rice was one of the first restaurants that popped up for Vietnamese cuisine when I searched for it on Yelp. Just 8 miles away, I drove over and found it easily in a shopping plaza. There is ample parking and I slid up right into a front slot.   It was around 4:30 PM and I came in solo finding a nice spot at the bar where there were other solo diners. The main dining area looked like it can fit up to ~60-70 people, outdoor space for ~20 people, and the bar area ~7 people. The restaurant has a trendy and chic ambiance, but I felt very comfortable dining solo at the bar where you can watch football on a flat screen TV.   To my delight, it was also happy hour (which I believe runs from ~4-6PM) where all appetizers were $1-2 off and certain drink specials. I was excited to try the happy hour food items and ordered the lemon grass brussel sprouts, slanted-sized (1/3 the size of a regular bowl) meat pho, and a fresh shrimp spring roll.   It was the first time I've ever been to a place that offered a smaller sized pho which allowed me to have room to eat other things! The pho was flavorful, but the slanted-size only offered rare meat, no tendon or the other add-ons, but that was totally fine being a sampler size. They do offer other options for the regular sized pho. The fresh shrimp spring roll was also delicious. The brussel sprouts appeared to be deep fried or broiled and were crispy. It's coated with a sauce fragrant with lemongrass. I did find that the sprouts on the bottom of the bowl were slightly soggy. It would be tastier if served on a plate so the sauce is equally distributed.    I left with a happy and satiated belly. I definitely will be back to try out many of their other popular menu items!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant, the decor is modern and upscale, the food is great. The chicken in the chicken pho is really flavorful and tender- probably the best I've had compared to any other chicken pho in the Valley. The staff are friendly and attentive, I look forward to each time I visit here."}
{"text":"best dish on the menu isnt even a dish! its an addition to a dish that you can also get on the side. i love the garlic noodles and always add the grandmas sauce to it  (which is spicy and addicting)!! my favorite spring roll is the dragon lady spring roll which has shrimp tempura and jalapenos in it. Food is always consistent. the owners are always in the restaurant and super friendly.   Poke spot for Pokemon players!"}
{"text":"Such a good restaurant! We go there about once a week and am always pleased. The beef salad is my go-to dish and absolutely delicious!!! In addition, the waitstaff is great. Cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Their staff is very friendly, and the food is consistently good. My favorite starter is the Garlic Butter Edamame. My favorite entree thus far is the Crispy Rice in Clay Pot with chicken, had it five times and enjoyed it every time. I also highly recommend the Garlic Noodles as a side dish to share with one person."}
{"text":"I feel like my review isn't going to count because this was my first time trying pho and I'm quite the picky eater. So of course I went on my wonderful yelp to find a pho place. The reason I chose pho was due to all the posts from family and friends. It looked delicious! This place had some great reviews and it looked clean.   We ordered the vegetable egg rolls and they were amazing! Perfectly crispy and great flavor. For dinner, I ordered the steak pho for myself and my daughter. When they brought it to the table, the presentation was really nice. Once I smelled the broth, I felt sick to my stomach. Even the waiter couldn't determine which spice was causing that scent. We thought it was maybe ginger and the waiter said it could be cinnamon. I'm pretty sure it was ginger. I tried to add their house made sauces to rid the smell and it just didn't taste good to me at all. I'm not sure if it's just this place that the pho smells weird but I think I'm going to pass on it. At least I tried!   They didn't take our food off or discount it. Sad to say, I'm leaving the restaurant with a headache and minus $45 bucks. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great quality with top-notch, fresh ingredients. Their pho is amazing! And their version of Bun Bo was the best I've had anywhere, thanks to the sirloin beef and jicama it came with. I'm a take out kind of gal, and I totally appreciate that they don't skimp on to-go orders."}
{"text":"Was not sure at first, but everything was good. Especially the chicken wings with fish sauce."}
{"text":"I can only report that this is my favorite place for Pho in Scottsdale, and it's definitely a nicer / cozier dining experience than the typical Pho, Asian, or fusion restaurant -- I haven't been disappointed after a dozen or so very large bowls.  I'm looking forward to trying something else on the menu but it's hard to break from my fav!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I love this place, and have put it in the regular rotation. The food is always super-flavorful and Happy Hour is a great value.   Special yums to the wings, the clay pots, and the salt & pepper shrimp (and salt & pepper calamari)... the fried jalapenos and onions that come with it are almost as good as the seafood! But beware: everything comes from the kitchen screaming hot -- you WILL burn your mouth if you disregard this notice!  Staff are very friendly and welcoming -- they seem to love being there, and like sharing the great food with the customers! Only reason to give four stars instead of five is that the service is a tiny bit random...doesn't seem like they're understaffed, but that everybody's trying to pitch in on everything and that's a less efficient way to operate a restaurant."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service! My company and I had the rare steak pho (pho tai) and we were very impressed by the food. The broth tasted very authentic and we appreciated that. The service also impressed my party. The wait staff were all smiles appeared to be having a good time which made the environment warm and relaxing.   We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I moved out od the neighborhood  and one of the restaurants  i really miss is this one......best soups ever."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here yesterday and were very happy with the experience. We ordered the chicken rice pot and the tenderloin pot. Both were really good and I didn't leave a single spec of food in the bowl. The rice that is at the bottom of the bowl was burnt and stuck to the bottom but this turned out to be an amazing positive, not negative. The burnt rice was super crispy and flavorful, not what you would have expected at all, so amazing! Also, we ordered the salt and pepper shrimp as an appetizer, excellent. The onions and jalapeños served with it were excellent as well.  Our waitress was very pleasant and provided excellent service. Make sure you get here early in the evening because the restaurant is very small and seating will be difficult. The only negative thing that I can say is they don't have high chairs for young kids. I have two children three and under, which this made things a little difficult.  Overall excellent food and service, definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Can't take a To go order??? Wow, I guess they just don't like money. If you have to work a little harder and stay open 10 min longer you probably should to make a customer happy. Just my luck because I was craving this all day. Very, very disappointed with slanted rice.  Next time put a little effort into making your customers happy and put in the work. If it wasn't Sunday I wouldn't be so pissed, as I would have gone to noodles ranch in the first place. Only thing better are the egg rolls here and the rice bowls, shit, and the shaken beef lol. Now I'm craving it even more! The more I write, I realize how good this place is and am now really pissed I can't eat it tonight!!! Damn you slanted rice!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a Vietnamese food expert and so I'm not reviewing Slanted Rice with any kind of mindset that this is authentic Vietnamese food.  However If the food is good than who really cares?  Two words: shaken beef.  It really is amongst the most delicious dishes I've had in recent memory.  Filet beef, onions, and a great sauce (that next time I will order extra for).  The wings with garlic were also a major hit as were the garlic noodles.  We ended up ordering a second side of it mid meal.  Was not a fan of the pho or the crispy rice dish, but now I know what to get because the rest was phenomenal.  Staff was great, food was great, and I will be back ASAP as well as recommend to others."}
{"text":"This is the best food and experience I've ever had!  I travel all over the world, and wandered in here because of the lively crowd and great smell.  I was welcomed with happy faces with great recommendation and amazing food!!!!  You have to try this and for sure, you will be back!  Try the spring rolls and crispy rice...and make sure to dig down in the clay pot to get the Crispy part of the rice!!!"}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food, but not this place. At best,the food is subpar, and way overpriced."}
{"text":"I'm still dreaming about the crispy rice in a clay pot from here. So good! My friend had the firecracker shrimp and garlic noodles and it was awesome as well. We tried a few other dishes, but these really stood out. Had a nice little patio we sat at for our lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken pho today and it would have been delicious but I encountered plastic in my food! NOT COOL"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant.  Incredible flavors.   Super high quality meat.  Sauces are the key though.   Unique and excellent.  Great vibe and fantastic service."}
{"text":"Very good! I had the chicken pho which was phenomenal and packed with flavor. I was able to take most of it home cause it was such a big portion and the leftovers were great too. We also had the spring rolls, love the peanut sauce!! However, I did try the vegetable rolls and the chicken teriyaki (both featured on GGG) and I didn't see the hype... good but nothing special."}
{"text":"The real Thai deal, but with better ingredients than most Thai places. Garlic Pepper Chicken lunch special superb. Nice little cup of soup. Tender slices of chicken breast, super tasty sauce, and two amazingly delicious hot sauces at the table."}
{"text":"Dinner for 2 on a Wednesday night at 8pm afew weeks ago. The weather was nice,we sat out on the patio. No wait,steady crowed,Love the decor, friendly staffs and I had Pho Meatball which was mediocre, my friend had Pho Ga with beef broth which he say was very delicious. Meatballs tasted different but definitely not a bad thing. My Pho Broth after taste was unique. Perhaps family secret recipe. I love secret recipe!  (^_-)  Although they close at 9pm ... We did not feel rush at all. It was a good night. :)"}
{"text":"We had another great dinner at Slanted Rice yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed it When I feel like Asian food that is my first choice And I like the freshness of the food and especially the shrimp soup  I also like the spring rolls - they're the best ones with the shrimp in the peanut sauce  I know my husband loves a couple of the clay pot items so we never have a chance to run out of something to choose from and are always happy when we leave there  I like the fact that it's a small place and intimate and close to home here in Scottsdale and yesterday I had my nails done right next-door so it is a perfect little treat on a Wednesday night"}
{"text":"great food.  great ambiance.  a little pricey but definitely worth it.  this is my go to place for vietnamese!"}
{"text":"Constantly good food, it's always hot and does not take a long time. This is the best place I have had Vietnamese food in a really long time. It was my best kept little secret but this is a gem that everyone should enjoy. I recommend everyone to try it at least once! Love at first bite."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 3 stars for effort.  The broth was okay. Portion size was good for the soup but only 2 egg rolls were served as an appetizer.  This place is more expensive than a traditional Pho restaurant.  I prefer a more traditional pho.  And I hate the name."}
{"text":"Giving Slanted Rice even one star is being generous.  I had heard such great things about Slanted Rice and love Vietnamese food so friends took me for my bday.  We had brussel sprouts  and edamame a la lemongrass ... both were very sweet and sticky.  As my main, I had the clay rice pot with tofu and veggies.  The tofu was disgusting - chewy and tough - like it had been cooked and then microwaved to heat it up.  I mentioned it to our waiter who brought the owner over.  She explained that they use firm tofu and proceeded to tell me about the different kinds of tofu.  No apology was offered, nor was the dish offered to be removed from the bill.  She didn't apologize.  I asked for rice with veggies which took forever to come out.  The dish had about 2 cups of rice and 1/2 cup of veggies - again, smothered in a sweet sauce.  My friends ordered tofu and chicken - both said they were spongy, touch and chewy.   I eat tofu all the time and have never tasted tofu so poorly prepared.   Totties, Malee's on Main and Saigon Nights all have delicious tofu.  NONE of them serve chewy, spongy,  tofu.  The soup that come with the meal was salty.  The salad was basically wilted lettuce.  The restaurant knew it was my birthday.  They didn't offer us dessert. - not that I was looking for a free-bee - they never even brought a dessert menu giving us a chance to order.  All around I had a very poor experience.  And, the prices were extremely high.  Rice with a few veggies $14.    Seriously!?   I won't be going back and neither will the two other friends I want with."}
{"text":"Ordered lemon grass rice was not impressed at all, food did not taste good, gravy had too much soya sauce and dish was over salted"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Would definitely visit next time I visit Scottsdale, want to try more on the menu. Service was great too. Grilled chicken salad was delicious and such a big portion. Clay pot rice was so good, juicy meat and lots of veggie."}
{"text":"Personally ,Vietnamese food is my soul food,it makes me feel home,cheers me up when sad and what not.Am super emotionally attached to the flavors and warmth of Vietnamese cuisine.This place is anything but authentic Vietnamese restaurant.Its fancy,it has presentations but trust me its way far from authentic Vietnamese flavor.  a)We ordered spring role(Shrimp and pork),it came in 1 pc cut in 2 halves,one side of the roll had meat (seasoned),the other side ,simply boiled,no seasoning whatsoever.The peanut sauce that came with it tasted like peanut butter !  b)Husband ordered shaken beef,it was good but too small for the price.  c)I ordered Chicken soup,the meat were very chewy,felt under cooked.Very uncomfortable to eat.Broth missed the flavors .The server didnt come even once to check if the food was OK.I didnt want to waste food I could just eat the noodles and the sprouts.  d)Server came to ask if its time to pay the check.When we mentioned him how the chicken was he took the bowl to show in kitchen.He returned with the check saying nothing back!   If you looking for authentic vietnamese meal,this is not the right place! And Btw the waiter never heard of \"Boba Tea\",right !!!Thanks but no thanks,not going there ever again."}
{"text":"What is not to love!  The ingredients are fresh. The spices and herbs so fresh you can smell the wonderful aromas as they set it in front of you. Pleasing to the eye, the nose and the taste buds. Cannot wait to come back again SOON and try everything on menu."}
{"text":"Looking for a gluten free restaurant & craving pho, decided to Slanted Rice, got there; kind of busy, had to wait for a table. Got seated and looked over the menu; they had (*gf) symbols, so made us feel at ease. Pho entree didn't list as *gf so had to ask. Ordered spring rolls; they brought out gluten free sauces, very good. Enjoyed Pho wish had more non broken bean sprouts, very accommodating once crowd slowed down; also very tight quarters. Enjoyed our time there will be back!"}
{"text":"New to Phoenix, rainy day and looking for great Pho!  It was fantastic, as was the salt and pepper calamari.  Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Lemongrass Brussels sprouts were tasty, and the broth to the vegetarian pho was lovely. All the components were fresh and vibrant. Will certainly come back when I am back in the valley. Great service, great food and if the weather permits sit outdoors!"}
{"text":"As lovers of good pho we have been trying to find a go-to restaurant in Scottsdale for a while now and Slanted Rice just became it. This review comes after three different visits and the food was on point each time. The restaurant is on the smaller side but has a cool atmosphere and on a nice night you can sit on the patio and enjoy. The wait staff is super nice and never minds accommodating a three year old with a healthy pho addiction as well!   The pho is the star of the show for us and their broth has the richness that only comes with a long preparation. One thing I really love about SR is that they also have a smaller portion pho on the appetizer menu! This gives you the opportunity to enjoy the soup and try one of the other many delicious menu items. So far we have tried the chicken salad with peanut dressing- great, the spring rolls- great, and the clay pot rice- great!   As you can tell there is a theme here of delicious food, top it off with a Vietnamese coffee or a cocktail from the bar and you wont regret it."}
{"text":"This would be 3.5 stars if possible: 4 for the food and 3 for the service.  We came in, were seated with food but not beverage menus then waited what seemed a long time.  I think this is another restaurant that has cut back on staff because of the minimum wage increase.  Since we haven't been here before, we don't know if this has slightly increased food prices, as well.  We had an appetizer and two entrees all of which were excellent. Come for the food if you don't mind waiting."}
{"text":"Had vegeterian pho...was good...but when I called to place order, I asked if all the sauces would be in bag w ingredients and was told yes. There was no sir racha !  I also ordered a veggie spring roll, asked if it was like the ones at rice paper, their sister restaurant, and again told yes. No...it was basically lettuce sprouts and asparagus and no vermicelli noodles at all! Hands down rice paper downtown is the best!!! Very cute interior though at slanted rice...I will try it our for dinner."}
{"text":"This was the most unique restaurant I have ever been at. It had amazing flavors and I wanted to try everything. The best part was the serves, the owner herself served us and was extremely friendly. I would recommend to anyone and everyone and I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Fire shrimp and shaken beef are fantastic  The staff was very helpful cool bar to sit eat and watch a game"}
{"text":"I decided to come here on a weekday for some lunch. Of course I really wanted to try their Pho noodle soup and I also ended up getting takeout in the process which was the grilled pork with steamed rice dish. There was also some salad included which was a nice surprise. While the Pho noodle soup was decent, the rice dish was a bit disappointing. It could just be the one that I ordered but there was no fish sauce and some hot soup would have really been appreciated. Also the portions were not very big for what I ordered compared to some of the other Vietnamese restaurants that I have been to. This was mainly true for the rice plate which was much smaller than expected.  Looking through the reviews on here I would have to agree that while this place has decent Vietnamese food, there are more authentic and cheaper options if you head elsewhere and the prices are quite high for what you get. I believe I spoke with the owners who are really nice people and had a genuine interest to get to know me so that's good. I also really liked the atmosphere of this place but sadly I'm not sure if I'll return due to the reasons that I mentioned."}
{"text":"My husband & I have never been to a Vietnamese restaurant before.  I have to say...absolutely delicious!  Everything we had was packed full of flavors!  The soup & salad you get before your meal to the meal itself was outstanding!  Definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"I was appalled at the customer service from every angle here. Sat down, did not get food for an hour and 20 minutes tables around us had sat down, ate, and left before we even got our food. It was obvious they had forgotten. We heard every excuse from the printer was down to anything else. How about just admit you forgot to put the order in and apologize? So after the long wait there was a hair in the salad. When we told our server about the hair his reply was \"Well who do you think did it?\" FYI we don't care WHO or WHY there was a hair in the salad just fix it. After returning the food there was no apology and instead of asking what we would like instead the server rudely hit the check on the table about 10 minutes later. They seemed to be understaffed probably due to poor ownership/management. Another note to management, I have received food with hair in it and I have actually returned to the restaurant because they have good service and they HANDLED the problem. That was not the case here. Skip this restaurant there are plenty others."}
{"text":"Food was tasty. We had the charbroiled beef and the shrimp garlic noddles which were delicious, but somewhat overdone - both the beef and the shrimp. Waitress was fabulous and very accommodating. But it was probably too late to go. We were there at 8:00 pm and the meal took forever to come and they forgot the soup and salad until they brought it with the main dish. And actually it was expensive for two entrees, no drinks at $45!  We would go back, but earlier in the evening to try it again."}
{"text":"Just tried the Slanted Rice for lunch with a friend today and I was, not only not impressed, I would not go back.  I had the combination Summer Roll, which cost $4 for one small roll and was not very good.  We split the Pho soup, which did not have much flavor, plus there was a lot of fat on the meat in the soup.  The soup also had sausage in it, which had very little flavor.  I also had a Vietnamese iced coffee and it tasted like it came from a can.  I so wanted to like this place :("}
{"text":"World traveler who eats Pho all the time. This place I give 4 Stars for the Pho. It was good lots of flavor but can't give it a full Five. Gave 5 stars for the atmosphere, trendy laid back and awesome music."}
{"text":"This place is NOT KID FRIENDLY. Does not have high chairs. My husband and I had to walk out with a 3-year old and an 18-month old because there was no accommodation for the 18-month old. (And my children are *extremely* well behaved in restaurants)."}
{"text":"Can you change the name of your restaurant so it isn't derogatory towards Asians? I'm sure you were thinking it was funny and catchy. But there are lots of other names that could be used as an alternative, right? Phô Sure!"}
{"text":"Holy Cow this place is nothing short of amazing, the employees are fantastic but food is mind blowing! Owners are there all the time and really care, they are friendly, personable. This place is perfect for romance, a night out, whatever...I LOVE this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The quality and flavors of the dishes is outstanding. We ordered the calamari and the shrimp appetizer. We also ordered a spring role, it was delicious and so fresh. The Brussel sprouts Were to die for. We also ordered a clay pot to share since we saw it on T.v. , it was also amazing. Definitely a place you need to try!"}
{"text":"Ok... in the spirit of posting, I HAD to review Slanted Rice. Always fresh and delicious. Good atmosphere. We love this place. The spring rolls are amazing and the vegetarian pho is the best I have ever had - and I lived near Mini Saigon, in Seattle. The staff is attentive and fast - and they welcome kids. The hippest place for mom and dad to grab noodles and enjoy time with our mini pho lovers!"}
{"text":"Omg!!!  This is amazing and I'm very picky.   Everything About the food, service and atmosphere is excellent.  Will for sure come again"}
{"text":"I love the ambience, the service is a little bit slow. Its not the greatest pho that I had but I love that they're open sundays. price wise they're expensive with the size of bowl they serve."}
{"text":"Delicious food and everything on the menu is amazing. Such a quaint, cozy spot. Give this is a try and this will become your new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! The firecracker shrimp and garlic noodles changed my life !!! The sangria was so refreshing and tasty .... I wish I would have found this place sooner. Everyone was so nice and the good was very fresh and delicious ."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner last weekend and had a really great experience!  I love the feel to this place - elegant, but comfortable at the same time.  The service was very friendly and attentive and the food was fresh and really tasty.  We shared the pork and shrimp spring roll to start and I enjoyed the lemongrass rice plate with chicken for my entree.  The servings were really large and the food was great.  I would definitely come back when I'm in the area for lunch or dinner...definitely a great option when you are craving Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Best Pho in the valley. It is crafted from the heart with an authentic recipe!! Also love chicken curry and all lemongrass dishes. The entire staff is friendly and entertaining. If you want an upbeat dining experience this place cannot be missed!!"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese cuisine in the devils playground ? You ask? PHO shizzle! I was very surprised by Slanted Rice Vietnamese Bistro a couple of weeks ago when a group of friends all landed from our various business trips for that particular week and met up for our monthly dinner outing to catch up with each other like we do someplace we haven't tried for drinks and of course , food!  Having grown up near the Bay Area, I know pho , PHO sho! , AND, have yet to really, REALLY, be blown away by any of the Vietnamese places here in the valley.  Slanted Rice is housed in the Hilton Village ; It's trendy ; chic and when you step inside, the vibe is cool; the mixology of drinks don't disappoint either. In fact, my Knees Bees Martini , a lovely libation of lavender honey gin, honey simple syrup, Yuzu, lemon and a smidgen of pomegranate will get you slanted , if your not mindful of your sips! It was stirred perfectly : not too sweet and not too tart and what I needed to end my week with. They have sake on tap; several brews, including Ichiban and Sapporo and a great, different drink menu with unique cocktails, as well as the usual beer and wines by the pint or glass.  Upon ordering our starters, we shared the Tom, (shrimp), Spring Rolls served with peanut sauce. It was a generous serving and I could seriously see myself grabbing an order to go for a later lunch since I love Vietnamese spring rolls so much. I loved that the waitress brought a selection of ramekins of sauces also for the dishes we ordered, as I like chile sauce on my rolls for some kick. The Slanted Pho is a great starter too, in fact, if you're like me and find the pho is always SO much to eat! , this is the perfect amount of Pho for the smaller eater: make it your main meal! A smaller bowl of the entree version.  My dinner entree was the Crispy Rice in a Clay Pot , (Com Tay Cam), with Shrimp. So unique! The entree comes out in a , ( you guessed it!), hot cast iron clay pot . VERY hot, in fact, to give the rice the crispness. The rice at bottom is topped with shiitake mushrooms , bok choy and the shrimp , (or the meat , seafood or veggie of your choice ), and this perfect amount of flavorful sauce. I don't think I would order this particular entree as a take out option, however, as the rice would, (as my leftovers did ), lose their crispy texture. My boyfriend , ( who became my fiancée on this night!) , ordered the entree Pho. Holy bowls! Maximum pho! This is one large bowl of Pho served ! He can never decide on one item so he got the combination of steak , meatballs , tenderloin, and flank steak. Loaded with broth and noodles and lots of meats .. and yes. He over ordered. Go figure. The Shaken Beef, ( Com Bo Luc Lac ),  is also a entree I'll try again. Tender, tender filet mignon served on a hot cast iron rectangular plate of sizzling onions and a side of freshly steamed rice. The Prawns with Garlic Noodles , ( Tom Nuong Va Mi Toi), was another favorite; a lot of large, nice prawns housed in these amazingly, garlic'd noodles. MMMMM.  All of our dinner entrees came with a bowl of scallion broth and small green salad with a miso ginger dressing. Needless to say, you won't leave Slanted Rice Bistro hankering for more. You will leave with leftovers if you were like us and over ordered to sample a bunch of different things.  I left this dinner outing, with a new blingy diamond on my left hand! The staff here was all in on it, ( as were our friends) and made the night fun and very special. IF I were to change anything , I would recommend later hours, particularly on weekends; this place has all the elements of a great bar so why not capitalize on that? 900pm closure on a Friday is just a tad odd to me .... But really, the food, unique menu and great bar and ambience give Slanted Rice a perfect 5 ..."}
{"text":"Food was GREAT. Pho was a perfect way to end a rainy day in the valley. Only complaint was the service. The staff was extremely friendly but it just seemed pretty slow to get food.   I did have an issue with my reservation though. I called ahead to make a reservation for two and was told that the earliest I could get it would be 8PM. I showed up at 7:10 b/c I was in the area and was hoping if something else came up I could get in early.. At around 7:25, two other people walked in and said they didn't have a reservation. The hostess came up to me and asked if I wanted to take the two spots at the bar or let the other couple have it and keep waiting. I was starving so I took the two spots at the bar, and the couple that didn't have a reservation was given a table for two before I could order my drink.. Made me wonder why I even had to make a reservation in the first place."}
{"text":"This is our favorite go to restaurant!! The owners and staff are incredibly friendly and attentive.  Best dishes go to: shaking beef, noodle bowl with pork, garlic butter wings, and crispy egg rolls. All absolutely fantastic. Best Vietnamese restaurant hands down."}
{"text":"Not good all frozen heated and not fresh. You can do better at home or Panda for Asian food."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. Great combination pho and Vietnamese coffee. Very friendly staff. Nice bar area for seating."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and just so happened to see it on DDD the day I bookmarked it.  This place is hard to find, there's an obstruction when you're coming from the south end of the parking lot that doesn't allow you to see their sign.   A friend and I walked in, were greeted by a hostess who told us there was only seating available at the bar. I was wildly confused because I took one look at the seating in the restaurant and noticed they were at half capacity. I chalked it up to possibly having reservations on the way, but it was weird especially because we were there 90 mins and only half of those unfilled tables had patrons in them during the time we were there.   At the bar we were greeted by a bartender, who during our visit was extremely overwhelmed.   The good: the pork short ribs are awesome, so is the sauce that accompanies it. We also had sweet pork sweet rolls that may be one of the tastiest dishes I've had in years, the vegetables inside were incredibly fresh. We also shared the banh mi, which was in flatbread (different but not in a bad way), it was full of flavor and spice.  I ordered the pho with tenderloin and my friend had a clay pot with chicken. My pho was incredibly underwhelming, I couldn't even continue eating it and had them box it up. My friend really enjoyed his clay pot, I wish I got that as well.  There's a few more things on the menu I want to try so I will be back to evaluate them again. Based on the hostess thing and being relegated to the uncomfortable bar stools and seeing a large portion of the main seating not being utilized and the overwhelmed lone bartender, I gotta say the customer service needs work.  The food itself, especially the appetizers, warrant another try at the place."}
{"text":"Love this place! The energetic, spunky lady is amazing! She's very sweet and professional! The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because their spring rolls are just 1 roll but cut in half. I like the \"old school\" places that actually give you two. They're still delicious though."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been great.Very nice atmosphere. I recommend the clay pot for your first visit. Bianca is awesome!"}
{"text":"The music was a little loud and did not particularly fit with the ambiance...but good food trumps all.  The pho soup was very good...I got the type with shrimp and the shrimp was very good as well."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I came to Slanted Rice last week with my mom who had always raved about the food, and I wanted to see for myself. We arrived in the late afternoon and sat outside. Our waitress was so nice and attentive and gave us her suggestions for her favorite dishes. We started off with the Dragon Lady spring roll, which was great. For my main dish, I got the Pho with chicken, which was so refreshing! They gave me a large variety of options such as mint, jalepenos, and sauces to add to my pho. My mom got the shaken beef, which was AMAZING. This was probably one of my top 20 favorite dishes of all time. The beef was sweet and perfectly flavored and came in a skillet on a bed of onions. Definitely visit the Slanted Rice next time you are in the mood for Vietnamese food, and make sure you try the shaken beef."}
{"text":"I went here with my book club once. I'm a huge fan of Pho. This place's pho was mediocre in my opinion. The service was lackluster. Once my soup was gone I wasn't even offered a drink refill, just handed a check. I'm sure they wanted to get our group out of there. The place is kinda small for that sort of thing. So I was thirsty and left a little unsatisfied with my soup. I probably won't return."}
{"text":"The worst pho I've ever had. Maybe it was because my order was to go. But the soup had zero flavor and the meatballs had visible tendons. The flavor of the meat was sub par as well. They containers for the sauces were tiny and only filled half way. They didn't give me any hoisin sauce and the basil was wilted."}
{"text":"I came here after reading all the great reviews about the Filet Mignon Shaken Beef. I am glad I checked this place out because the food was delicious!   I ordered the beef pho and my friend and I shared the other items. My friend and I shared the pork egg rolls and shaken beef.  The beef pho broth was a bit on the sweeter side but it all worked out once I added some hot sauce to it. The shaken beef was very tasteful and it was nice to be able to order the lunch special version of it. The egg rolls were good and it was nice to share a variety of food.  The service was decent since it took some time to get certain things. I've been a server and I've had good and bad days so I'm not going to be too critical on that.   The restaurant has a nice outdoor patio if you would like to eat outside. It wasn't too busy when I went here so there was plenty of seating available. The prices were a bit high from what I am used to paying in Sacramento but it is what it is. I would definitely come back here for my shaken beef and pho fix.   I also ordered the wine special which was $10 for a half bottle of wine. The special was for La Crema and it was delicious!   It's also cool to know that Guy Fieri came by here also!"}
{"text":"I don't know what was worse, the food or the service. Or maybe the fact that I paid about twice as much as other Vietnamese restaurants who give me both better food and service. I'll never come back here again.  When I entered, I was never greeted. So I sat myself at the bar. The bartender never saw us and never greeted us and said she would be right with us. Instead, she finished what she was doing and a few minutes later asked if we needed a water. What a slap in the face. We ordered two bowls of pho and spring rolls. It literally took 30 minutes to come out!! For pho? The broth is already made! Geez. I've never waited that long before. To add insult to injury, when it finally came out, my bowl was luke warm; not even hot. As a matter of fact, the rare beef never fully cooked in my broth. It stayed pink and rare and mushy. And the noodles were over cooked and mushy too. I bet they had my bowl sitting on a counter with piping hot broth for 15 minutes. And it continued to cook my noodles. But then it cooled down. They probably dropped the steak in lated and served me a bowl of cold soup. If you're going to charge $5 more per bowl than other Vietnamese restaurants, maybe you should either serve it hot or have amazing service. What a bust. If the owner knew this was going on, I know he'd have someone's head for it"}
{"text":"Service is VERY VERY slow, but food is great. If you're not in a rush (expect a hour and a half lunch for Pho), defiantly worth checking out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here all the time for date night and we always have such a great experience. The music is never loud or obnoxious like some places, it's very relaxing and chill and the look of it is too. It's very clean, the servers are all very nice and professional (yet personable), and it's the best pho/Asian food in town. And if you're not a big eater (like myself) and you're wanting to order pho I would recommended getting the \"slanted sized pho\". All of the different kinds of meats are offered for this size and the serving size is about the size of an average soup bowl. It's what I get every time and it's always the perfect amount of food, especially with edamame as an appetizer (the lemon grass edamame is super yummy!!)."}
{"text":"The slowest service. We were here at 2:45 and now it is 3:53 and we still don't have our food. The thai ice tea is out of a jar.  Now we have to hungry so we can be on time to our meeting. I would not recommend this plac at all."}
{"text":"Get the shrimp curry! Enough for two meals. I love their jasmine rice too! Decor is adorable! Kind of hard to find, just look for the outdoor curtains that are on the patio."}
{"text":"The place is very nicely done, great staff, clean bathrooms and really great decor - the ambience is great - you could bring an office mate to lunch and still have a nice dinner with you spouse in the evening in this setting...  I have a shellfish allergy and my husband has a gluten allergy... So we were pretty cautious is ordering our meals - we had the tofu roll, pork Vietnamese rolls, caramelized salmon and crispy rice with tenderloins... On  the side - we had tried the edamame, and garlic wings...   Everything was awesome! The crispy rice on clay pot was particularly awesome and the rolls are excellent.... The fried spring rolls are tasty... You just know when the chef pays particular attention to his creation.   Their cocktails are great too - I had the Lychita where they have their own housemate lychee vodka! And their white sangria is also good!  Got to check it out helpers!!!"}
{"text":"Slanted Rice is ridiculously good! I have been going here weekly for about 3 months now and can't get enough. Everyone I have introduced loves the place too! Some of my favorite dishes are the spring rolls, curry, charbroiled chicken plate, and the garlic noodles. Everything is fresh and the staff is always friendly. Love!"}
{"text":"I agree with Kelley H. Had the pork and shrimp egg rolls which were mediocre and a little undercooked. I was concerned but they said they freeze the egg rolls so the pork which looked very pink was ok. I thought these were made from scratch. Try the Tottie rolls at Totties 2 down the street which are way better. I also had the meatball pho which was very bland and the meat looked and tasted like sausage. The server didn't offer to get me something else when I said I didn't really like it or when he picked it up and saw I ate very little of it. The service was ok otherwise. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Great service, even better food. If you are in town looking for something else other than brewery style resto food.  We were glad to have visited this place!"}
{"text":"Went spur of the moment with a dear friend.  LOVED the service, LOVED the food, LOVED the decor!  Had an excellent experience.  They have a gourmet, extensive menu, that is as delicious as it sounds.  We had the special shrimp ceviche, curry shrimp and grilled shrimp salad...YUMMMMM!"}
{"text":"A Coworker brought me here for my birthday and I couldn't be more impressed.  After checking the reviews I gave the Firecracker Shrimp and Garlic Noodles a try and oh my goodness.  I do not even know where to begin.  The broth and salad that came first were delicious.  The shrimp was amazing and the noodles were out of this world.  Because it was my birthday we also got some of their chocolate mousse which was a HUGE win.  It tasted amazing.  I will be returning and soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal. Cute ambiance with wonderful not your typical Vietnamese dishes. Super create way of serving. Family run and superb awesome service"}
{"text":"This is place is wonderful.  Lots of locals. Food is delicious, the atmosphere is cool, good service and the owners make you feel special.  What a great restaurant and they have an awesome happy hour!"}
{"text":"I just adore this spot!  They have a great menu and lots of veggie items.  The spring rolls are good and nice in size.  I really liked the one with tofu and peanut sauce ... All the yumminess!  The brussel sprouts appetizer/share plate is amaaaaazzzing.  Its a salty/sweet sauce with a hint of lemon... wickedly delicious.  They also have vegetarian pho, and an appetizer size that is just right for me to pair with sharing an app or a spring roll.  Prices are fair and the staff is so welcoming and caring. On my first visit they walked us to our cars (it was about 9pm) even though we were parked right in front, because the bank in their lot had a break in recently.  They have outdoor seating, and the turnover is pretty quick, so you can always get a table.  I've been here a handful of times and will keep this place in my rotation.  Thumbs up for doing things well!"}
{"text":"a quick and dirty review  I was in the area for a business trip, it was 3pm and I still had not had lunch. I love pho, it's my comfort food so I was glad I was able to find this place.  I ordered the steak pho and it was solid. The broth could use some work, but not bad at all. Don'y forget about the sauces!  There was barely anyone there since I was dining during off-hours, bur service was quick and polite.  The only negative I think can think about this experience is that this place is hard to find. I suggest reading the description on the yelp page to help locate the restaurant."}
{"text":"This Americanized Vietnamese joint will make dew if you need a quick pho fix. The lemongrass Brussels sprouts are a highlight on the appetizer menu and are packed full of flavor. The pho here is relatively good but you are limited in options. Like all pho places, the servings are colossal in size. Unfortunately the menu is in English and it takes away from the authentic feel of many other Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"Total heaven! I go here often to order their pho and spring rolls. Super fresh with a lot of flavor and large portions."}
{"text":"This place was bad in just about every category.   The service was really slow. It seemed like they had one server for the entire place on a weekend?   The prices were very high. $4 for one spring roll. Enough said.   The food was bland. Previously mentioned roll tasted only like mint. Pho broth tasted more or less like water.   The one redeeming item was the firecracker shrimp. Very tasty. Not sure how they managed that...but it was still expensive."}
{"text":"Very tasty, very fresh.  I was quite surprised as I don't think much of Asian food in Phoenix, but this was good.  A little pricey for lunch I thought, but the quality of the food and service made up for it."}
{"text":"Instantly attracted to the restaurant. Modern, clean and GREAT FOOD. The environment is very welcome and the staff is very personable and extremely attentive and caring. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Best Bun ever! I live in LA , but when I visit my brother in Scottsdale we always come here! I get the vermicelli noodles with charbroiled chicken every time"}
{"text":"Amazing tender juicy shaken beef for only $16 lunch including broth and salad! Dinner portion is $22 way less expensive then American Steak houses. Managers trick is to serve a lime with salt and pepper which enhances the already delicious juicy flavors. I loved the broth and salad dressing a lot too. Hue (pronounced hway) the manager is adorable due to her outgoing friendly bubbly nature and obvious passion for the food they serve. I am visiting from San Diego and bookmarked this lovely Bistro for any future travels to Scottsdale. My husband ordered the pork plate which was also very flavorful. Interior is modern hip. Happy Hour from 1-6pm!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Pharrell Williams - Happy)  It might seem crazy what i'm about to eat Scottsdale it's here, you can take a bite I'm Bo Bites a writer that could go to space Yelping fair, like I really care baby by the way  At the Slanted Rice Come along if you feel like a drink without a proof At the Slanted Rice Come along if you feel like Vietnamese food is for you At the Slanted Rice Come along if you know what happiness is to you At the Slanted Rice Come along if you feel like that's what you wanna eat   I'm not sure if I should be offended or just shut-up and eat!  At first, I'm sure the slanted part got my feelings hurt, but once I walked and tried the food I was delighted!  I'm not a person easily offended needless to say.  I came here with a couple of my vegetarian friends on a Saturday night.    The owner was serving us and kept us company all night!  I started with the appetizer Pho and some eggrolls.  The eggrolls had a perfect crunchy shell with a warm and moist stuffing of pork and vegetables, it was a pow to my \"Mou\"!  Okay, bad joke aside, it was an eggroll worth ordering.  My appetizer Pho, which to my surprise; how do you make Pho and appetizer!?  Well they did and it worked since it gave me the opportunity to try other entrees without feeling too full.  The Pho broth was perfectly warm and pungent to my nose.  Fresh herbs and sprouts came along the plate and the overall size of it was just enough to wet the palate!   For my entree I shot for the Crispy Shrimp and Garlic Noodles while my vegetarian buddies went for the clay hot pot and  stir fry Vermicelli Noodles with Tofu of course!  Starting with mines, the crispy shrimp was doused with a spicy aioli, but the crunchy coating was what me love this dish, the noodles was dry ramen with a strong garlic and parmesan bite; definitely unique to my palate!  My buddies said they loved their vegetarian dish and I couldn't help but eat off their plate; mainly the clay hot pot!  The clay hot pot dish is a must order here; it made the rice at the bottom of the dish a crusty burn shell but man!  I freakin' loved it!  I think I ate half of it while finishing my own dish!  It came with a medley of marinated vegetables and your choice of protein; gotta say the mushroom in this dish was phenomenal!   Overall, the ambiance was chill and the place had a Victorian Posh feel.  Service was tops and we were showered with love....and drinks....and dessert haha!  -  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the East Valley! My co-workers and i all frequent this place at least once a week for lunch (sometimes I go twice in the same week). There honestly isn't one thing on the menu I would advise against, everything is tasty!  The Pork Bang Mi is killer, some people say a little heavy on the jalapeños, but the spicy kick is more than welcome with the sweet pork and cilantro.  But their Shaken Beef is the real deal. Simmered steak comes out sizzling like fajitas with onions, a side of white rice,  and a small dish of salt and pepper with lime. Guaranteed to fill you up and leave you satisfied. The place is a bit small, so wait times can be rough at the lunch hour, but the staff is friendly and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"We live on the other side of town, but come over especially for this place. It's the best Pho in town and the owners are a lot of fun and super nice people. We even order it through Postmates when we can. My favorite is the shrimp and vegetables pho. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a healthy Pho this is the place.  Great place for hot pot dishes!"}
{"text":"Upscale Vietnamese food.  I was here for lunch and had a combo meal with grilled beef.  It was very nice and I enjoyed the friendly service and a casual lunch on their front patio."}
{"text":"Don't ever go here unless you have a LOT of time on your hands. I'm normally pretty forgiving. This is my 4th time here. They're either incompetent when it comes to service or chronically under staffed"}
{"text":"First time at this Pho spot! My friend had never had Pho and so I yelped and looked for a great spot to introduce her to some awesome Pho. This spot was reviewed by quite a few people with great ratings. So I decided to bring her here and hoped that she would love it. Well, it was a success and I loved their Pho! Their Pho had just the right taste of broth and not too overpowering. I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town (Canada) with a strong Vietnamese community and good Vietnamese food. We were very pleased with our experience here.   Server suggested excellent choices and we were left holding our stomach and leftovers back to the hotel.   We tried the shaken beef; clay pot for mains. Appies were Brussels sprouts and the spring rolls.   All very tasty and will be back again."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, everyone that works here is very attentive and friendly. The Firecracker shrimps and garlic noodles are my favorite!! The shaken beef and clay pots are incredible too.  PS- It's kind of absurd to rate a place one star when you're admittedly a picky eater, you're eating something you have never tried before and because they couldn't identify the spice in the food YOU didn't liked? I'm as surprised that review made it too."}
{"text":"I was really blown away this establishment. I really enjoyed my crispy rice with fried tofu. The waiter was very sweet and accommodating. I enjoyed everything I had there thoroughly."}
{"text":"Slanted Rice has become our go-to for take out.  The owners are always so friendly and accommodating and everything we've tried have been delicious.  Faves: Pho - mandatory hangover cure.  SO MUCH better than Noodles Ranch.  There is actual complexity in the broth.  If you're a broth junkie like me, their scallion broth that comes with the entrees (and you can order separately as well) is the same as their pho broth.  Garlic Noodles - Such an genius idea!  Fragrant but not overbearing garlic flavor and some added mmmMMMmmmm with a sprinkle of cheese.  Great with sriacha if you're into spice.  Clay Pot Rice - I really wish they did this with Chinese sausage but ehhhhhh... What you're really looking to get here is that crispy rice goodness all around the clay pot.  DO NOT GET THIS TO GO.  You will miss out on the crispiness!  What you want to do is to mix everything together so you get all of the flavors of the chicken and mushrooms and sauce and the awesome crunch texture of the rice sprinkled in.  YUM.  Sooooo... not to be a Noodles Ranch hater, but seriously drive the two miles north and come try this place (all you Colonial Grand dwellers - looking at you).  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a bit of upscale ambiance to go with your Vietnamese food, Slanted Rice is your place... I've been a handful of times and it hasn't disappointed.    The food is more unique than some of the more casual, traditional Vietnamese places I frequent... I can't speak to authenticity because I've never been to Vietnam.  (Hopefully one day!)  That being said, it's consistent, satisfying food in a modern, classy atmosphere.  A few of my favorite menu items are the spring rolls and curry dishes.  My husband enjoys their Pho.  Head in during daily happy hour (3pm - 6pm) for $1 off Spring Rolls and $2 off Appetizers.  There are also discounted drinks daily from 11am - 6:30pm.  I haven't been in to take advantage of SRVB's lunch specials, but they look like a great deal and include salad and rice (+ soup if you eat in).  Service is friendly, but can be on the slow side.    Keep that in mind and don't head here when you're starving and want instant gratification..."}
{"text":"We came here with coworkers and had a large party that was easily accommodated.  The waitress was super friendly, and was very in tune to my dairy intolerance.  I ended up ordering the filet shaken beef which was delicious!  It came with a lime wedge and some dipping sauce with rice.  My meal came with soup and salad and everything was great.  The space was a little dark, but other than that it was a great spot for dinner."}
{"text":"Not an expert on Vietnamese cuisine, but this place was great. Got 6 dish's for 5 people and shared and all were great. The only negative was the calimari that was just ok. Everyone thought the same thing and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Everyone should get a second chance... So tonight I went back to the Slanted Rice. Once again the service was OK. But the food still SUCKS. I will never go back. This place is a lost cause. The \"cooks\" in the kitchen have no clue, except for chopping lettuce. Everything is flavorless, shrimp way over cooked like rubber, and pork/ canned \"Treat\" full of grease. Rice noodles were like a ball of glue.  So sad that a nice looking restaurant with an OK location is spoiled with Bad Food.  The review in Phoenix Mag. was right the Valley is full of much better choices."}
{"text":"awesome FRESH food !  love the simple clean look and feel of this great Vietnamese .  great service and even better prices !"}
{"text":"I was a fan of this place! As we walked in, the interior definitely surprised us. It looked modern trendy and has some pretty hip, techno, pop music playing. Lights were low and some cool chandeliers lit up the place just enough to give a romantic ambience. There were a few couples, not too packed for a Monday evening, although enough people.  Took about 5 minutes of nobody greeting us at the host stand that we just decided to walk to the bar to ask if we needed to seat ourselves. The bartender welcomed us and asked us to join him to watch the Grammies but we opted to sit at a table. In fairness, it was 8:05pm- and they close at 8:45/9.  A server came to give us menus and ask us for our order. All else with the service seemed fine- wasn't stellar, wasn't bad. We ordered shrimp and pork spring rolls, the tenderloin and vegetable pho and the combination pho. Took about 5 minutes for the rolls and another 7 for the Pho which was nice. Was served with the typical sides and hoisin along with 2 chile pastes.   The pho was Goooood!   The server took until we were paging for the meal to offer more water, which was unfortunate. I also wanted more lime but she didn't come back until I was close to being done. It was fine.  Overall good experience and good food. I would be back."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with good food. Yellow curry, vermicelli noodles and lemongrass surf and turf were good. Clay pot rice was ok, but not bad. We will probably come back, but only if we are prepared for the potential loud atmosphere. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a high-scale Vietnamese dining, this is your place. Food is tasty! The reason for the two star rating is the service: an Asian lady who works at the bar was not particularly welcoming and was pretty condescending. With the price you are paying for the good, you'd expect better service."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with family while on vacation.  The food was very good, considering I didn't expect there's much ethnic food out here in the desert.    I stuck to ordering a few appetizers to try as many plates as I could.    The vegetarian spring rolls were really good.  Crisp, fresh, and a nice dipping sauce on the side.  They normally come with two, but I asked to have them cut it into 3, and they were happy to oblige.    The sweet fish sauce chicken wings were generous portion wise, and were nice mix of flavors. Sweet, salty, spicy, and sour.  I was hoping it had more of a fish sauce flavor, because the sweetness overwhelmed the dish.  Avoid ordering the Brussel sprouts.  They overcharred the veggies, and while the fish sauce offered a balance to the smokiness, there's too many bitter charred pieces. I prefer them less well done.  We also ordered a Bun Cha Hanoi, which was the house specialty vermicelli. Charbroiled beef, pork patties, and shrimp with fish sauce vinaigrette and greens. Great mix of flavors.  Overall a really great food experience.  Service was great as well.  I'd come back if I visit the Phoenix Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Really like the place.  Food is great and everyone is very friendly.  Didn't give them 5 stars because the service is a little slow (seems to be only 2 waitstaff during the lunch rush)."}
{"text":"PUBIC HAIR and Horrible service! Owner had the most disgusting attitude after mentioning we hadn't received our salad and soup for an hour and twenty minutes... Oh yeah and there was a PUBIC HAIR in our salad and no one apologized!!! Wouldn't recommend. However, to be fair, their ice tea was decent"}
{"text":"I just paid $17 for a bowl of plain steak pho plus some veggies to go. The bean sprouts were not fresh and the cilantro looked like it had come out of another person's bowl of used pho. The broth did not really taste like much either. For being in Scottsdale I can understand slightly raised prices but not $17 FOR A BOWL OF BASIC SOUP.  NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN- GO TO SAIGON NITES OR UNPHOGETTABLE FOR NORMAL PRICES & BETTER FOOD!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here: About 5 times In short: This place is definitely worth a try. What's good: Lemon grass wings, various spring rolls, fried rice, Vietnamese coffee, service and ambience Quickly becoming a favorite. Would very happily bring guests, or friends, to show off a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing..never had pho or vietnamese food before.. have to say that this is the best in the valley. Would . recommend it to anyone. . Become one of my favorite places.. I suggest the pho or shaken beef"}
{"text":"I came here with my mom while visiting home. We frequent this center for the restaurants and are never disappointed. Slanted Rice popped up since my last visit and since my parents have adopted it as one of their go-tos.   We were seated quickly and almost immediately ordered. We started with the Dragon Lady Spring Roll. It was mild in flavor and mixed textures perfectly.   I really wanted to try one of their shrimp dishes but opted for the Chicken Crispy Rice Clay Pot. Eating this was an experience! It took a little too long to cool down for a quick lunch, so I probably would recommend it for dinner. The flavor a were phenomenal and the crispness of the rice really made the cool down wait worth it.   Overall, I had a great dining experience. I'm excited to try more on their menu and hope there will be lasting power for Slanted Rice!"}
{"text":"Don't over look this place. To start your greeted with pleasant service and classy atmosphere. The crispy rice clay pots and firecracker shrimp that followed a surprise broth & salad were all dressed / seasoned perfectly. Hands down best little gem in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Coming from South San Jose in California, I've been spoiled with an abundance of delicious Vietnamese cuisine. I came in during a quiet time around 6pm on a Saturday, and was seated immediately as a result. While it's highly Americanized and overpriced compared to what I'm used to, it's a friendly atmosphere, and my Charbroiled Chicken Vermicelli noodles were delicious. A taste of home! Will definitely come back if I want more Vietnamese food"}
{"text":"This is a gem in Scottsdale - I used to have to go to south Scottsdale or Tempe to even find decent Vietnamese food and i'm so happy this place is just down the road from my place!  Also a huge plus - they are open on SUNDAY! There is nothing better than a big bowl of Pho on a Sunday.  The broth is rich in flavor.  At lunch you get a small bowl of just the broth and its such a little treat.  My favorites:  Dragon Lady Spring rolls Garlic noodles with Shrimp Rice Vermicelli with Shrimp Chicken or Beef Pho  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in the Valley.  Great atmosphere.  The service is great and they also have a small but nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Knowledgeable, friendly and attentive service. They quickly accommodated our need for outside seating and rearranged for us.   We loved the lemongrass Brussels sprouts and the spring rolls.  Clay Pots and Curry were on point.  Drinks were refreshing and the beer selection was solid.  This is a fantastic little place that you should definitely hit up!!"}
{"text":"We found a new spot for dining in Scottsdale! It's a great venue with tasty food and a super-friendly manager, Hue (\"way\"). The wife got the shaking beef, which was amazing. I got the chargrilled pork with rice, which was very good. The Vietnamese coffee is strong and not too sweet, just like I like it. Lunch soup is their pho broth, which is great, so the pho should also be very good.  A nice, clean modern interior with a long bar for neighborly chatting and an exterior patio make for two excellent eating environments. And don't forget about their happy hour that runs from 1-6pm or something like that. Bonus!"}
{"text":"I have this odd flavor stuck in my mouth... I love pho but this pho was nothing like my Vietnamese friends make. Just not a good pho experience...my coke was watered down...for the location I expected better..."}
{"text":"Fox News and the Golf channel to compliment my lunch? Appreciate the constant reminder I was in the great red state of Arizona. With that being said, service and food were just ok. Noodles were a bit overcooked..."}
{"text":"Excellent service with authentic Vietnamese cuisine. We felt so welcomed as soon as we entered the restaurant. A hidden gem, don't tell anyone!"}
{"text":"God Bless Yelp! Because of it and it's wonderful members, I was able to find this place. It was very busy when we arrived so we took at a seat at the bar. The bartender was a young gal who was about as OCD as I was. She never touched a bare straw with her fingers and made sure we were taken care of.   There are lots of people that wrote the service was slow, and that may have been the case, but I was busy catching up with my friend so it didn't bother us too much. I've never been to such a \"upscale\" Vietnamese restaurant. The ambiance was great, the food was delicious and the prices were reasonable.   If I'm back in the area, I'd definitely come back for another visit."}
{"text":"The service was super slow on a Saturday night because there was only 1 server. All in all I found some of the food we ordered a complete rip off, and the rest wasn't good enough to make me give an overall positive review.  The spring rolls (pork and shrimp) were $4 per roll. The rolls weren't large, nor were they so special they should be $4. Usually I expect to get 2 rolls for the same price.   We order the pho (beef) appetizer. I didn't eat it, but my friend said the broth was bland. They weren't impressed (we're from LA, I realize we're probably spoiled by great pho). My friend also ordered the vegetarian pho but didn't seem too impressed.   The one star of the night was the firecracker shrimp and garlic noodles. I have to admit, when they brought it out it didn't look very appetizing, but it really was tasty. I'd order it again.   Don't order the spring rolls -- order the firecracker shrimp. Expect a long dinner.  I paid $15 for my share of half an entree and the solitary spring roll."}
{"text":"Slanted Rice is beyond fabulous! Excellent food every time I have been there. Wings and everything on the menu is made fresh to order it is amazing. The service is excellent and the food is beyond superior. I also enjoyed the atmosphere which is very cozy. Try the brussels sprouts too!. M Hayes"}
{"text":"Excellent Pho! Best Vietnamese  food in the area! The owner and staff and gracious and kind. Their food is amazing! My kids request slanted on a daily basis!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Slanted Rice because everywhere else was closed on Sunday! And we're so glad we did. I didn't care much for the egg rolls (they didn't have veggies on the side just lettuce and mint) but the flavor was still great!! Our server was awesome- friendly but not over the top and even when they were out of the wine we wanted she totally compensated and gave us another glass of something else. Overall great service GREAT phó, and super yummy freshness! 5 stars."}
{"text":"A perfectly fine Vietnamese-ISH meal in the heart of Scottsdale. Authentic Vietnamese? Not really. But still good. A decent Vietnamese-ish experience. Kind of like a watered down martini. It's watered down and doesn't pack the same punch, but it's still a martini!   Would we go back? If it's July or August and the other more authentic options are closed, yea, probably. Any other time of year? Meh. Probably not. There are too many other options."}
{"text":"had dinner on a Saturday night and got in around 6pm before they got to crazy. Great service from everyone all around..  Ordered the Crispy rice in the clay pot with chicken and it was great. My cousin ordered the same thing and they loved it so much they tried going back the next day but told them they are too busy to take orders for take out. Not sure what that is about but a good way to lose customers fast. Lots of restaurants close down after being on DDD because they do not know how to handle it the craziness and probably dont know how to handle the books.. dont turn away customers!!!"}
{"text":"I don't live very close to Slanted Rice but I always stop in when in the area.  The food is delicious and I am always greeted with a smile and glad to see you back.  I had some Czech friends visiting and they had never had Vietnamese food before and they loved it.  The owners family have several restaurants in the Valley and they truly know what they are doing.  My friend was suffering from a cold and I said get the Chicken Pho, I had the Slanted Hanoi, and my other friend had the Shaken Beef.  It is now their favorite restaurant.  People that have never tried Vietnamese food will find it to be their favorite as well."}
{"text":"What great cozy little place! The owner actually serves there and is perfect in every way. The surf and turf Phoo is incredible, the owner brought several wines to sample before choosing. The food is clean and natural and delicious."}
{"text":"I wasn't thrilled. It is definitely not authentic food. The Pho was mediocre with very bland broth. The best thing was the fish sauce wings."}
{"text":"They don't even worth \" one star\"!!! A girl with a ponytail who showing the attitude from the bar, it was like you take it or leave it. There was no occasion for her to being such rude!!! It was a terrible experience and I won't visit this restaurant anymore!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ate there about two weeks ago for lunch.  It was a beautful day, so we sat outside.  Good choice.  The owner and staff were very nice and very helpful.  I had the Crispy Rice in a Clay Pot with Chicken.  Our server highly recommended it. Although it didn't sound  that great, since I had never had it before, I thought \"Sure!\"   And man, I'm glad that I did.  Delicious.  If you get it, be sure when the dish comes out that you scrape the rice off from the around sides and bottom of the pot.  The releases the heat (it's HOT) to cool it off a bit and releases some of the flavor as well. My wife and sister-in-law got the rice vermicelli with chicken and both thought they were very good."}
{"text":"I visited here on a Sunday early afternoon which is Pho O'Clock in my book.  Nothing better than pho to revive you from a Saturday night out about town.  I had the egg rolls as appetizer and the steak pho.  Both were good but somehow lacking inspiration and missing an element of authenticity that I can't quite put my finger on. Too many other pho options in the Phoenix area that are better to make a return visit."}
{"text":"Try the Garlic Noodles!! Literally the best noodles ever! The garlic is not overwhelming, but distributed evenly throughout the dish, with a lovely buttery taste! My new comfort food :)  Not your typical Vietnamese restaurant. Has a fancy feel to it.   And the staff, so friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner!  Just went with a group and really enjoyed the ambiance and the food.  We shared drinks (interesting list of specialty drinks) and caught the end of happy hour.  As our appetizers, we ordered the spring rolls served with peanut sauce and edamame with 2 sauces (lemongrass was my favorite) - very fresh and tasty.  For entrees we shared garlic noodles and shrimp, the caramelized salmon and crispy rice with shrimp in clay pots, and lemongrass chicken.  The dishes are all served with a side salad and a bowl of broth (pho) for mixing in sauces.  It was all very fresh tasting and delicious.  They also have a nice outdoor patio and appears dog-friendly.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect Vietnamese spot for a quick and delicious lunch in North Scottsdale. Set inside the Hilton Village shopping center behind the Chase Bank, there is seating both inside and outside with a cute shaded patio.   I had the tropical spring rolls and a Slanted size beef pho. The spring rolls had shrimp, vegetables, wonton strips, and mango. Everything was fresh and cool, a good contrasting juxtaposition with the hot beef pho. I enjoyed all the ingredients in the spring roll overall, but there were so little wonton chips in the roll that they didn't provide much of a texture difference in the dish. The miso vinaigrette dipping sauce and additional \"grandma\" chili sauce provided by my server were flavorful and great with the roll.  The pho was perfectly portioned for lunch. You'll find it in the appetizer section of the menu. It had a good ratio of beef to noodle, and I appreciated that the cilantro was a component placed on the side rather than chopped up into the soup. It was on the same plate with the requisite basil, bean sprouts and lime wedge. Overall I liked the pho. The beef was thinly sliced and very tender. The broth was more on the light side and didn't have a lot of depth or complexity of flavor as pho from other restaurants I've been to though.  Service was friendly and sweet from Priscilla.   If I'm in the area and craving Vietnamese food this is a good option to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing Vietnamese food! But if taste alone could suffice a dinning experience, no one would eat out. Place closes @9pm. Advice - don't go after 7:30pm. Staff looked not interested. Won't offer table even if there are a few people at the restaurant, reason given waiter is already behind on tables. Poor gentleman behind us fell badly slipping on unswept food. Wish someone would have made sure he was ok. Staff will give a warning for the last call for food without even offering a menu. Wish the service does justice to the quality of food this place has to offer."}
{"text":"That was the worst experience I've had in years. I tried giving zero stars but couldn't. It was all because of the server and it wasn't just my table. Everyone was pulling their hair out. Sucks when bad service ruins a whole restaurant. The server was just clueless. I served tables for years and this woman had no idea. I'd rather be kicked in the dick than eat there again. Then let's finish with the slightly racist restaurant name. I'm part Asian and didn't take offense, but then again I have thick yellow skin."}
{"text":"I didn't know this place was on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives..so I was excited to see Guy Fieri's face spray painted on the wall with his signature when I walked in. I was promptly seated and given water right away. Overall - the service was awesome.   With the lunch special, you get a soup and salad. The main course I got lemongrass chicken and a side of garlic noodles. The chicken was....horrible. It wasn't cooked all the way through or cooked correctly and had that chewy nasty texture in your mouth. I barely touched the chicken. The garlic noodles, on the other hand, were fire! They also hooked me up with a good \"grandma's spicy chili oil\" which was really good on the noodles.  I would give this place a second chance because of the service and the ambience...but I would stick to ordering vegetarian food. That chicken was absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times...great to sit outdoors and people watch. Had the chicken lemongrass rice plate for lunch, and for dinner the Filet Mignon Shaken Beef. Great presentation of the food, high quality and very tasty..lots of flavor.  Nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Pho soups are the best in Scottsdale with exceptional service and pleasant atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place has a nice ambiance that reminds me of a nice Vegas restaurant with it's upscale mix of a classic and modern style. I ordered the shaken beef and loved the sauce, filet, and onions that come with the dish. The portions are very filling with the salad and broth that come with the meal. It's hard to beat the price with filet mignon at $16 for the lunch meal. I also tried some of my cousin's chicken clay pot meal and it was delicious as well.   The service was as good as the food. Our server Priscilla was friendly, prompt, and made sure we were taken care of the whole time. I've been spoiled with great Vietnamese food in San Diego, so it's nice to find a gem like this in the valley. I'll definitely be back, and the the only difficult part will be deciding which dish to try next!"}
{"text":"Super happy to have found a good place for pho in Scottsdale! I've felt like there aren't enough options in the area but with this addition I hope that is changing. I alternate between the meatball and chicken and always add extra veggies. The service is prompt, the space is clean, and the prices are super affordable. This is our go to spot when we're in town and craving comfort food but don't want to cook. My husband swears by their curry dishes and egg rolls. They have a awesome assortment of spring roll and other traditionally inspired appetizers as well. Oh and did I mention they have a full bar? The place has great range, perfect for lunch on a random Tuesday or a fun Friday dinner and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Had dinner twice here.  Food was very good!  Authentic with a slight twist of western flare. Egg rolls are very standard and good.  Clay pots are our favorite!  I had pho both times, thought the broth was too thin, not enough flavor.  I will not come here for pho, but will try other items.  Service was very good and friendly.  Great place for neighrbood eats for Scottsdale, a town that lacks of taste buds and variety."}
{"text":"Amazing place with very good food. Pho soup is phenomenal! The place is clean and i love it!"}
{"text":"After a long day of Christmas shopping, we were looking for a place to eat dinner and found this little gem.  We went around 6PM which is a bit early for our usual dinner time but we were sure glad we did! Right after we were seated, a throng of people came in and the whole placed got packed within a span of 30 minutes.   The Happy Hour deal is pretty nice. Try it. I don't remember the details but we got $2 off of our spring roll, which delighted us with the burst flavors within each bite.   I had to try the Chicken Crispy Rice in the hot pot due to the raving reviews. Holy Hot. The temperature of the bowl is amazingly close to an active volcano. Which kept the food hot for a very long time. The first few bites, I felt like I was in heaven. However, after a few bites, it started to get too rich for my taste buds.  The flavor of butter and soy sauce starts to get a bit overwhelming. I wish they'd use less butter, but then again, it'd probably hinder with the process of the rice getting \"crispy\".   My husband got the rice noodles with pork. Oh my goodness. Now, THAT was delicious! The vegetables were crisp and perfectly seasoned. The pork was so very good. I ended up eating the rest of his bowl after he was done.    Overall, a good experience. Servers were very nice and attentive. The ambiance is very nice and posh, which is (sorry to say) unusual for a Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Yes, definitely a good choice for quick lunch spot in or near Scottdale area.  Good location and limited  seating for abt 40-50 people. Prices are considerably reasonable in Scottsdale. Highly recommending order : Combination Plate ."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Crispy rice clay pot.  I will return here many more times!!!  The spring rolls were also great.    Best Asian food I have found in the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"My new favorite Asian restaurant! I've tried about everything on the menu & everything is so delicious. Great service! I'm so happy I found this place & I will be coming here all the time now"}
{"text":"Extremely good pho I loved it here! The service was great and attentive and there is an outdoor patio which is nice in the evening."}
{"text":"Family owned and great food, whether you like Pho or Bun you really can't go wrong with any selection you make.  Ice eaten here at least a dozen times and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am from Houston, TX and we have pho restaurants on every corner. I eat Pho at least every other week and I can make pho as well. So my family and I got there my and ordered Pho the waitress informed us that the broth is vegan. The pho was pretty good being that its vegan and the vegetables (bean sprout and basal were not fresh at all) but I have had better and the price was too expensive $13.00 a bowl and in Houston a large pho is $7.00."}
{"text":"when i dine here i always sit up at the bar and the service is exceptional.  The food is great. my sister digs the firecracker shrimp with garlic noodles. we both love the spring shrimp rolls.  wonderful presentation too! the decor is pleasant and the vibe is great.  i would definitely recommend this little gem of a place tucked behine chase bank.  even though you will like one dish, force yourself to try something new every visit, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time to meet friends who go there often.  Followed the advice of other Yelp reviewers to have the chicken/rice hotpot - very good. Among the appetizers that we ordered the roasted brussel sprouts was the biggest hit.  The shrimp with lemongrass was also very tasty.  Wine list is good and not overpriced.  Good craft beer on tap as well. Quite a lot of salt in Vietnamese cuisine, so drink lots of water.  Restaurant is not too noisy. Service is good.  A nice neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Busy with limited seating on Valentines Day but well worth the wait. Extremely friendly staff with great food at a good price."}
{"text":"After a long Sunday full of adventure and almost freezing to death, I wanted something hot to warm me up. We decided on pho, of course. The misfortune was that we were in Scottsdale and it was Sunday. EVERYTHING is closed on Sunday's! Boo! Luckily yelp pulled this place up and even better than being open on Sunday's was that it didn't close til 10 (most pho places close at 8).  We were hoping this place wasn't \"too Scottsdale\" because we looked a mess. It wasn't too Scottsdale? It was Scottsdale enough. The Interior was small and cute.   We were seated by the hostess and then the bartender/waitress comes over to get our drink orders. We decided on the pho Thai, which was #3. The waitress came over and we said we wanted a number 3. In a snarky voice, she replied \"which #3, there are #3s all over the menu\"...maybe you should change your stupid menu then huh if \"there are 3s all over the menu.\"  We got our pho. It was good. Nothing spectacular. No complaints. It did what it was meant to, which was to warm me up. The entire time, the waitresses were talking all loud about \"omg like what do I take on this trip with like my boyfriend like totally omg, literally.\" It was annoying. We hurriedly finished our food as we couldn't stand hearing nonsense for any longer.   I might come back if I'm in the area and no other pho places are open. I'll make sure to sit outside to avoid hearing the waitresses talk."}
{"text":"Slanted Rice is a small more-or-less Vietnamese restaurant located in the Hilton Village outdoor mall, near its north end.  It has all of the ingredients it needs to be a great addition to the Scottsdale dining scene, except for what I call \"food design\".  For example, the Drunken Beef - basically filet mignon cubes with fried onions - had a big problem: the beef was tough and chewy, probably because they used the filet mignon tips, or possibly because the meat was not filet mignon at all.  The crispy rice bowl with chicken was a smallish bowl of cripsy rice, but it came with such a scarcity of chicken and vegetables that it wasn't much beyond the rice.  The chicken that was there was dried out.  There were other issues with the food as well.  The free broth served with the meal was bland except for a strange almost cinnamon taste.  The egg rolls were small and the filling was mushy.  Although prices at Slanted Rice are not high (our entrees were $16 and $20), the portions are small and the value is barely there.  On the other hand, service was good, the menu was interesting, and the ambiance was inviting, but that was not enough to make up for the food, which was passable at best."}
{"text":"There food is amazing , but they are extremely overpriced. They charge $8 for two sides of rice. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and amazing staff   This is such a fun place that is always great.   It's a small very friendly place"}
{"text":"Just great. If you have a craving for Vietnamese good this is a great to try or go again on a regular basis and explore the menu. Everything is good. They have a nice veggie pho. There can be a wait at times but staff was nice."}
{"text":"Are you kidding with the most racist restaurant name ever? Im giving a poor review on that alone. Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for some pho on this cold night!! The pho here is pretty good, the flank meat is very good, but the steak pho is beyond horrible, tough and chewy and not good. The meatballs and flank steak were all really good though!! So my recommendation is to get the combination without steak. The atmosphere is good with good music but I felt like I was in a high school locker room with the waitresses talking and gossiping together...they were talking pretty loud about their trips coming up and their boyfriends...obviously a place I could never take my parents to even they have been looking for a pho place. Not professional environment at all...food is solid 4 stars and the gossip makes the environment 2 stars..."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous lunch on the patio. We had vegetarian pho, salt and pepper shrimp and vegetarian spring rolls. Seriously, so fresh, so flavorful, and absolutely delish. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Shrimp Crispy Rice CLAY POT is all I can say! Holy moly this was FABULOUS."}
{"text":"I'm so confused by all the positive reviews of this place maybe it was an off day but I was just not impressed... and frankly super irritated.  So, I pull into the parking lot based off of my smartphone directions, the restaraunt is located in a long strip mall/shopping plaza. I gave them a call to find out specifically where they were located.  I was parked near the Starbucks which is smack dab right in the middle of the strip mall.    I called and asked \"I'm at the Starbucks, where are you in relation to the Starbucks?\" The girl who handled my phone call tells me that they're at the end of the complex.  Oooookay.  I replied, is that the north end or the south end? She said to go right from the Starbucks.   Well depends on whether your are facing east or west at the Starbucks.  I tried to get more information from her but it was clear that she was directionally challenged.  We ended up walking to one end - not there and then to the other end... found it!   Typical of this location and area the place was decorated nicely and very modern and clean looking. They had a nice small patio outside and my son chose to have us sit there.    Food:  This is what we ordered: Salt & Pepper Calamari $10 Spring Rolls Pork & shrimp with peanut sauce $4 Pho Thai $12 Pho Meatballs $10 (I think) Thai Iced Tea $4  Salt & Pepper Calimari - it's Calamari steak, breaded in panko and deep fried.  It's served with fried jalapenos and onions and a spicy mayo dipping sauce.  The sauce is what makes this dish decent.  The calamari is nothing special, very similar to something that was supplied from a frozen food company.    Pho Soups:  Broth was meh - mediocre at best.  It lacked the depth of flavors that I've had elsewhere. The Pho herb & sprouts plate was sufficient but my cilantro looked like it had been frozen and thawed and given to me.  Eeeeek.    Thai Iced Tea: Came pre-mixed, made me think that they didn't make it here since it wasn't layered.  Spring Rolls:  This was supposed to be an appetizer but was served to us AFTER we were almost done with our pho and AFTER I told the waiter not to serve it to us since we didn't get it as an app.  Service:  Service was ok but has plenty of room for improvement.  1.  They forgot my spring roll appetizer, after we had been already partaking of the soup. The waiter asked if we got it, I said no and told them no need to bring it out now and they did anyways with no apologies.  People, take some advice, it COSTS you nothing to apologize.  It's FREE.  It's just a word that has value but costs you nothing from your own wallet... use it when it needs to be used.  When I first started this review it had 2 stars... once I checked my leftovers... I took it down to one because I can't even re-eat it... (see below)  So we ended up leaving with lots of leftovers, the calamari app, a full order of spring rolls and our soups.  I get home this evening, unpack our food and am completed frustrated to find that they didn't include the peanut dipping sauce for the spring rolls NOR the calamari dipping sauce for the calamari.    What a waste of my hard earned money, I recommend that you don't waste  yours.      If you're looking for some great Vietnamese fare, definitely check out my other reviews of other restaurants in the valley that will KNOCK your socks off without the cost."}
{"text":"You must get the pho. Best pho I've ever had. Has the umami flavor that will have your mouth watering for days after you try it."}
{"text":"Great little place while out shopping in Scottsdale ! Happen to be visiting a friend nearby - try the clay pot - lemongrass stir fry & of course the PHO !!"}
{"text":"I picked up pho from here when I was feeling sick! The ambience here is cute! It's a little nicer than most of the pho places here and it looks like the bar was well stocked. The bartender was very friendly.   The pho was good enough for me to come back. Not the BEST I've had in my life but it will do for Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"My fiancé & I have been to every restaurant in the Hilton Village! This was the last place we hadn't tried. We wish we would have tried Slanted Rice sooner! It has an intimate feel! We loved the Lemongrass Brussel Sprouts and the Spring Rolls as an appetizer. We probably could have stopped there because we were feeling pretty full, but then we both had the vegetable pho! This was my first time having pho! It did not disappoint! Everything was delicious, fresh and reasonably priced! We will be going back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just tried this for the first time, staff was very friendly, service was great and the food was awesome! I had the pho, super good, my husband had the clay pot which he loved. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Slanted Rice appeals to all my restaurant wants: it's owner operated, cozy, & the food is homey and delicious with satisfying yet healthy-ish options. Our favorites: chicken pho and the clay pot crispy rice beef. The Brussels sprouts appetizer is hands-down the best sprouts dish I've ever had! We get take out more often than we eat in, because this is my go-to take out place."}
{"text":"The quality of Panda Express. Super salty. The curry was watery. The tofu could not hold is shape. When you walk in it smells like a bathroom."}
{"text":"Really good food and nice service. Had a beer shrimp spring roll and another Shrimp dish I don't remember it's name.  All was really fresh and unique.  You should go and give it a try. Look like a nice place for romantic dinner as well the cocktails looked good."}
{"text":"I've been a few places and this it seriously the best Pho I've ever had. Great service and one hell of a friendly crew. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It time for me to right a well deserved review for slanted rice.  I come here every time I visit but last week I moved here.    Consistently amazing food !!!! I have tried the shaken beef.  The rice vermicelli . The Pho,  the broussel sprouts are so so good.  Salt and pepper shrimp with onions and jalapeño are also a treat. Service is good and alwAys on pare.    I will be eating here at least once a week !!  Love love love slanted rice"}
{"text":"Prepare yourself for a great culinary experience!!  Great food, great service and very nice wine list.  There is something for everyone here.  The food is very fresh and the flavors are incredible.  Small restaurant not far from Houston's on Scottsdale Rd., well worth the trip from any part of the valley.    He sister owns another great Vietnamese restaurant, Rice Paper.  Check them both out.  You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Delicious new Vietnamese restaurant! More upscale than most but still just as tasty as the mom and pop shops. We started with the pork egg rolls which were really big and very good. Pho appetizer is a perfect size if your not too hungry and really cheap on happy hour ($3). Atmosphere and service were awesome. Definitely a small dining area so it's probably crazy busy during lunch and dinner hours. I recommend going at happy hour so you can get in!"}
{"text":"The fragrance coming from the restaurant was amazing. I was waking to Humble Pie and smelled Vietnamese food, specifically pho. I didn't realize they are neighbors to humble pie. I didn't want to try this place because I saw the prices and it was higher than what I was used to paying for authentic Vietnamese food. But then, we ARE in Scottsdale and we are paying for the service and ambience.   I ordered beef pho. I always taste the broth first before adding condiments. I like my broth clean. I guess it can't be too clean because of the beef. The noodles seemed over cooked. But when I added Sriracha, mint, bean sprouts, cilantro, jalapeño peppers, and lime...it all came together. I was enjoyed the pho, surprisingly. I didn't expect too much because of the restaurant being in Scottsdale. But I'll definitely come back. The have happy hour!"}
{"text":"I will admit, the place is a bit pricey, but this place is great! I came here a couple weeks ago with my family and we really enjoyed it. The atmosphere was really nice and the service was great. But enough of that, the food was top notch. I really liked the appetizers: chicken wings with a hint of lemongrass in them. I devoured them so quickly that I was almost full before the entrees came. I had a garlic noodle dish with shrimp. I enjoyed every bite of it. If you're around, this place is definitely worth looking at for a nice, delicious dinner!"}
{"text":"Chloe is amazing. She has only been working here for about two weeks, and is all over the place. Knows the menu very well, and works behind the bar.  The pho was actually really good, spices are available right in front of you.  Little overpriced for cocktails and drinks, but the phone was reasonably priced, especially considering the amount you receive."}
{"text":"We were there the other day for lunch and both of us had the Clay Pot. It was yummy. I tried the Pho last time which I liked as well. Great place for a different flavor from other Asian fare."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the new pho place close to him. Egg rolls were much bigger than usual. My girlfriend loved the appetizer pho tai. Pho dac biet was amazing. Huge portion and delicious. Really great atmosphere compared to other hole in the wall Vietnamese places."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in town. Pho is exceptional. Wings are tasty. Shaken beef is a MUST. Great friendly staff. Good for takeout or dine in... love this place"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place based on all of the Yelp reviews. Service was on point the day that we came in. The pepper shrimp was the highlight of the meal! I don't know what was more tasty the lightly breaded shrimp or the sauce. Since the firecracker shrimp received rave reviews my husband ordered that. Well I convinced him to because I was afraid it would be too spicy for me, but it wasn't. My husband was obsessed with the garlic noodles on that dish!  This place is a little more pricy than a traditional Pho establishment but it's definitely nice to splurge. Get the pepper shrimp!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few times and find it to be overpriced and the pho \"just okay\".... service is always good tho. I would like them to have a richer broth rather than a plain not so tasty (almost watery) pho broth. There are a few good pho places around and I would only come here if I really am on a time crunch.  The atmosphere is great though, I love the decor and like I said the service is always good as well."}
{"text":"Very, very good food. Service is laid back and they are a little quiet for a Friday night.  The Edamame was excellent. We ordered a second of it because it was so good. My hubby got the pho but I  opted for the crispy rice which was delicious."}
{"text":"I keep going back to this place to keep trying new things.  The Clay pots and Firecracker Shrimp with garlic noodles (not overly garlicy) are awesome.  The family behind this restaurant from what we were told get thier recipes from thier grandmother and she is on point!  They have several different concepts around the valley.  Other than the name which seems odd the food is legit and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Fancy decor and Vietnamese cuisine don't often happen in the same sentence, but this place is a fabulously decorated Vietnamese restaurant!  They have this cool lighted tree branch sculpture/chandelier that was really mesmerizing.  The restaurant itself was not that large and somewhat narrow.  But it's still able to fit a lot of people, we came with a large group of 20+ people!  I wasn't that hungry, so I ordered the clay pot rice with veggies and tofu to share with my friend.  It came with soup and salad, and we were able to order extra soup and salad for $3 so each of us could have some.  The salad and soup were tasty, although the soup less impressive than the salad and the soup kind of had too many chives in it.  The clay pot rice was great!  I loved how the clay pot made some of the rice hard and chewy at the bottom of the pot.  The tofu and veggies were also good.  My favorite part was the mushrooms, I wish they had added more of those!  Overall great experience and I would come again, but I will note that I wish they had better ventilation.  With all of the steamy dishes being cooked in the kitchen, the place was getting smoky and hazy inside.  And when I went home my hair and clothes all smelled of food."}
{"text":"Really like their Pho.  Vegetarian .  Luncheon specials great!  Always good service and friendly.  Great for lunch!  Low calorie but filling.  My new favorite place.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Placed a takeout order for dinner.  Had to wait 30 minutes in The restaurant for them to bring out our food. We drove home, opened the bags, and they completely botched our order. I had to drive back to the restaurant and wait another 10 minutes for the right food. I haven't eaten it yet, so can't vouch for the quality, but it's my last take out experience at slanted rice."}
{"text":"Pho king awesome. I had the Pork Bahn Mi wrap, veggie spring rolls and plum wine ice cream with fried bananas. The spring roll was huge, fresh, cool and delightfully crunchy. The Bahn mi had a modern twist with a pita wrap instead of hoagie and a nice lightly spicy mayo. Even with the reduction in bread it was large and filing and the pork was cooked perfectly.  And the plum ice cream and bananas were so amazing that even though I was already full, I had to finish them.  The staff were really nice and very attentive without hovering.  Plus the happy hour prices are insanely low. I felt like I was robbing them. ...but no complaints."}
{"text":"The Pho Ga was great. The ambience is classy. The service could have been better but overall, solid Pho experience. Good spot for a date."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The food is to die for. Every time I go there I order something different on the menu. I haven't had a bad meal yet."}
{"text":"From out of town in area for a business trip. Looked up on Yelp to see if there is a vietnamese cuisine in the area. Found Slanted pRice , decided to stop in for a good dinner. Food is okay, was very pricey . Served small portion. Most likely not coming back."}
{"text":"As a Vietnamese myself I would love to support my own people businesses but the pho here is so horrible. All you could taste is the spices which was way too overwhelming. On top of that a bowl for $12-14 dollars is way too much. Do yourself a favor n go to a more authentic place for cheaper. I get that this place is probably catering more to Caucasians and its fancier but the taste doesn't have to compromise. Spring rolls were ok can't go wrong when things are fried. We're from out of town so I wouldn't know whats better here in scottsdale."}
