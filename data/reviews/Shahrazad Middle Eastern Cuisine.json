{"text":"We all loved this restaurant! Everything is made in house with love from scratch. Order the Maza platter to start. Do yourself a favor, eat here now. The chicken sharwarma sandwich is perfectly moist And wrapped warm. I have no reservations saying this is the best middle eastern spot in town ."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this \"hole in the wall.\" I love Middle Eastern cuisine and this was inexpensive and delicious, not to mention the people working there were SO NICE! We got the chicken kebob that came on a bed of rice with fluffy naan, a side of hummus, and a small cold salad. We also tried the Mansaf, which was tender to the bone and on turmeric rice. We got yogurt salad (delicious) and the Grape leaves! It was really good. We will definitely go back... I can't wait to try the Pistachio Baklava. If you're on the fence about trying this place, TRY IT. 100% WORTH IT."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The food is great, the prices are great, and the people were great.  If I lived here, this place would be one of my regulars.  It's new, so right now it is not packed. I highly recommend it. 

I came back again and tried the lamb mansaf. Fantastic. Also, try the Jordanian coffee. I had the fruit cocktail shown in he picture, which was delicious."}
{"text":"We could not resist we had to go again. They had a new fish dish I just cant remember the name of it, my wife had that as for me I had Kabssa love it."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened last Friday 21 Feb 2014 .
At opening day, I came with my wife & my kids and we ate grape leaves , Chicken Kabsa, and beef Shawarma. The food was good especially the chicken Kabsah. 
At Second time in this friday, I tried the Fried Fish and it was very delicious . 
In general , I would recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants to try one of the best middle eastern cuisine in Arizona  ."}
{"text":"drove for more then half an hour to discover this place was closed like Fort Knox. No sign, no sorry, no nothing. And Yelp said open for business."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  The menu had numerous cross outs. The salad was dead on arrival, brown wilted and Drowned. 

Hope they get back on their game."}
{"text":"Finally a good \" mansaf\" ! I have been looking for a good place for this Jordanian dish and this is the place. Great staff as well."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this restaurant while in Paradise Valley for a short vacation. We'd struggled to find decent food during the first couple days of our stay since most places here are your run of the mill chains situated in strip malls and the places that are not, consist of exactly the same overpriced, uninspiring menu items (the demand for mac & cheese and short ribs here astounds me). 

That said, this restaurant is located in a strip mall, but given that they are ubiquitous here, I can't hold that against it.

We actually ended up eating from here twice because we wanted something different to what kept coming up in our yelp searches, it was easy to get to (apparently the concept of delivery - at least through the yelp app - hasn't really caught on in the area yet) and the food was good. 

First dinner was takeout and consisted of the following: 

Fattoush- tangy, fresh salad topped with crunchy, tasty pita chips. 

Chicken kebabs- grilled chicken on top of rice with a side of hummus and salad of chopped tomato and cucumber

Chicken mandi- probably the most tender, tasty half-chicken I've had in a long time, served with rice and a lovely hot sauce. This dish is what inspired us to go back a second time 

Second meal was dinner at the restaurant - we chose the floor seating and enjoyed:

Arabic salad - chopped tomatoes & cucumber with a lemon /olive oil dressing

Megalgl- ground lamb swimming in a tomatoey sauce of deliciousness (this was fantastic...I could have just had this and a salad and I would have been happy)

Lamb mandi- fall off the bone tender leg of lamb swathed in a bed of rice and the yummy hot sauce mentioned above

Had a lovely conversation with the family members who run the restaurant while we ate and if I lived in Scottsdale, I would come back again. This is not a fancy place and it doesn't need to be. The space is a bit large for itself, but it doesn't really matter though a more desirable location would probably suit them better as I'd guess a good portion of the business is probably take out. With a little more creativity and additional investment in the physical space, it has the potential to be a unique spot in an otherwise cookie cutter desert of eateries in the area. 

I'm all about supporting small businesses, and this fits that definition perfectly, so I'm thrilled we found it, were able to support the local community and have two enjoyable meals from here."}
{"text":"We were looking for Middle Eastern and decided to try this place for the first time. So delicious! Smoky baba ghanouj, delectable hummus, perfectly done falafel and amazing grape leaves. Did I mention the pita came out hot and fresh? The beef kufta platter is incredibly generous with amazing rice, cucumber salad and hummus. The hot tea is beautifully spiced and goes perfectly with a cake I can't spell, but was amazing. And the owner and staff were so nice and friendly! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Had two orders delivered by DoorDash, first time ordered Lamb Kabobs, was called and told out of the Kabobs, offered Lamb Shank in its place. Fair enough and it was very good.  Ordered Lamb Kabobs again tonight and was delivered some inedible thing that looked like and tasted like stool samples.  I have no idea what it was but it went in the dumpster.   DoorDash (or Home ripoff, as I like to call them) sent me a message saying they were again out of the lamb and sent the stool sample instead.  Never again, obviously a tiny operation that prefers to be out of product than spend a penny. Avoid."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Our first time eating middle eastern food and we loved it! We had the true authentic mansaaf and it was so fresh! Everything including the sandwiches are good. They do a really good job of making something even American, more middle eastern. They give out recommendations when you're confused on what is good! (Just like us) All in all 10/10 and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The best mansaf ever!!! Love their food, thou we always order to go, never dine in.we tried their shawrma also it was gooooood! The fries came with paprika spices which was so yummy!! But their mansaf has my heart, the lamb shank that came with it was so tender and fell out of he bone and the yogurt sauce was perfectly balanced."}
{"text":"I drive all the way from Flagstaff for their seasoned fish and tender lamb. Yes, it's that good."}
{"text":"THIS IS THEIR CORRECT # 480-941-3423


I tried this place with two Arab friends and they LOVED it. We got a sampler of the chicken and the lamb and it was delicious. The rice and lamb was especially tender and juicy and I am planning bringing back all my local guests to this area. The owner gave me his cell phone when I need to reserve the place for a large number of places. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The food was very tasty and authentic. If you wanna go to a mom and pop kind or restaurant then I say go here. It's definitely a low key vibe with lots of different foods."}
{"text":"What a killer meal! Came here the Saturday after Christmas with half the restaurants in the area closed. The owner himself gave us some great recommendations for appetizers and a sample of food for the table. We started with a plate of freshly make falafel and grape leaves, then feasted on a giant platter of rice, chicken, lamb, and kabobs for four. We're talking fall-off-the-bone, mouth-watering meat heaven here, people. Finished everything with some Turkish coffee and tea. Perfection. I've been looking for something like this since I visited Baghdad in 2003...a home-cooked, family-style meal with deep, rich, and authentic middle east flavor combinations.

In short: authentic, robust, and really great service. Get here before this place becomes a thing."}
{"text":"Checked into hotel and searched Yelp for nearby restaurant. Shahrazad had great reviews, open until 9pm and across street.  Arrived at 7:50pm and was told they were only open 10 minutes (until 8pm not 9pm) but could order take out. Looked at menu and many items crossed out. Finally ordered lamb shank and falafel. Asked to make sure they included plastic fork and knife.  Told they only had spoons. Fortunately hotel room had cutlery.  Food turned out to be quite good."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and have always been happy with the food, it is delicious and unique. 

However, the restaurant as a whole needs a lot of work.  The menu has not been accurate for quite some time.  While it is understandable to occasionally run out of an item, when several things have been taken off the menu completely, it's time to print a new one. No American sports are shown, and frequently there is only Arabic broadcast with no sound and no subtitles, making for a dull dining experience. 

Drinks are overpriced. No alcohol is served for religious reasons,  which is fine,  although I'm sure it detracts business. However, a single can of soda costs $1.50, and no free refills are provided. I can get a better value from a vending machine. The menu is very limited, and while delicious, it severely lacks in vegetarian items,  or vegetables in general.  When you come here,  expect meat and rice and nothing more.  

As far as service goes, it's hit and miss. There seems to be high turnover, and a lack of consistency, which points to flaws in management, in my opinion. Cooks seem to come and go as well, as food is not always presented in the same manner. 

I have not visited for a couple months, but last time I was there I noticed a sign indicating the business was operating without a license. This caused some concern. 

My reccomendation is to enter at your own risk. While I enjoyed the food for some time, I feel it is not worth the drawbacks, and can find most of the same items at other Middle Eastern restaurants."}
{"text":"Really awesome dinner. The proprietor wanted us to have a great experience and we did.  Visiting from TN and this was such a lovely experience.  The hummus is very special.

Eat here."}
{"text":"I love the lamb and rice! The lamb leg is tender and delicious, and the rice taste so good! I don't like McDonald and fast food. For me, only homey food like this can be my dish."}
{"text":"very authentic food,,, unique dining experience, food served origanaly from Yemen and Gulf Countries .... my favorite is Mandi  Lamb"}
{"text":"The smoked chicken is absolutely delicious and the people who work here were extremely friendly and accommodating. I came in on a whim so it felt like a gamble but such good middle eastern food."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! my husband and I eat at alot of middle eastern restaurants and by far this is one of the best. I ordered the Chicken kabobs and rice, and they were perfect. My husband, chicken Mandi ( not sure if I spelled it right) but he was just as impressed with everything. As my husband is from the middle east, it's hard to find real authentic food but once we entered the restaurant, the atmosphere and the hosts are genuine. They went up and beyond to make us feel welcomed. By the time we finished we gained new friends and found our new favorite restaurant! Thank you so much for being so hospitable, and thank you again for the delicious food. We will certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"Poor service, food was very old and never back to this place , the combination plate has very little and it 10:99 $ it was very small amount for this money , and it just has 4 kind very small amount"}
{"text":"Best shawarma I have had in the U.S.! No questions no doubt about that! A damn good shawarma! 

So the restaurant was pretty empty on a Monday night. But I really enjoyed the food--- ordered lamb and chicken while dining there and got the shawarma to-go! We also ordered some baba ghanouj (which was okay-- not that great! I have had better), and some yogurt on the side!

In general the serving sizes were huge! There was definitely plenty of rice that came with the food too! 

Everything was great! Loved it!"}
{"text":"OMG...I am from Chicago which has some of the best Middle Eastern restaurants in the US. So while visiting Scottsdale, I searched for something good. FOUND IT. Have tried several other M.E. places here, but this is a real FIND. I called and ordered my food to go, but when I walked in, I wished I had eaten in. Place was really cute...had some tables near the floor which would be fun to experience next time. REALLY GOOD chicken Kabob...the MOST delicious hummus and tabouleh i have ever tasted. Hasan took care of my order and was very friendly and eager to please....even gave me extra items on the house. GO...you won't be disappointed!     Shannon from Chicago"}
{"text":"Exquisite middle eastern restaurant with an authentic atmosphere. Hands down the best in the area. The best lamb I've ever tasted. So tender and delicious! I'm addicted to the tea as well. Hasan and Waleed are the most gracious of hosts. They make you feel like family and you'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome! Had the lamb mandi and SO had chicken kebab plate.
The lamb was succulent and cooked to perfection. Haven't had something like this anywhere in the bay area.. Had a chat with the chef Hassan. He's making his mark already :)

Ooh .. And definitely do savour the hot tea ! It's super smooth on the palate and liquidy goodness..

Unfortunately that we have to be on a plane in an hour.. Would have sampled a lot more otherwise ..

Great job sir!"}
{"text":"I liked how they have a different type of seating area with seats on the floor made out of carpet with short tables next to them. I ordered the Falafel sandwich. It came with hummus, lettuce and tahini sauce. I requested for them not to put pickles and tomatoes on it. I didn't like how they don't serve ice water. We asked for three cups and got 3 water bottles instead. The waiter told us that was the only type of water they served. It yelled money hungry and already started things off on the wrong foot. We told the server we didn't want the water bottles. I later ordered a soda since the food definitely required some kind of drink with it to help wash it down. I was dissapointed when my food came out and the portion was extremely small compared to what they normally give me at other middle eastern restaurants. They only gave me 3 fallafel balls, barely put any hummus on the pita bread and the pita tasted bland and old. I didn't like their hot sauce and that would have been the only thing that could have saved my dish, had it been at least half decent tasting but it just tasted like vinger and I really don't like hot sauces that taste like that. If you're going to make the fallafel sandwich that small then at least give a side of rice with it like every other place I've been to does. We had the baklava for dessert, it wasn't as sweet as I'm used to it being but it wasn't bad, it just didn't have much flavor compared to the baklava I've had at other places. I did not enjoy my visit and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for Sunday supper; we chose this place based on the good reviews. The restaurant is clean and spacious and the service was friendly. We ordered pretty standard stuff: stuffed grape leaves for starters, lamb kebab for my entrée and roast half chicken for my friend. The stuffed grape leaves were good, and the flavor of my lamb kebab was OK, not knock-your-socks-off great, and it was a bit on the dry side. I'd give this place another chance if I come to this area in the future but it's not a place I'd make a special trip for."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a late lunch, around 4:30 PM on a Friday afternoon.  It was pretty quiet in there, to be expected at this time of day.  The restaurant is very nice, beautiful decor.  The owner also was our waiter, and he was very helping in deciphering the menu options.  I settled on lamb and my mother had chicken., both dishes came with rice.  Both of our meals were delicious!  We loved every bite!  There was no meat leftover to take home, but I have enough rice for several more meals.  Our service was great and food was delicious.  They are not located in the busiest of shopping centers so hopefully they get more traffic!  We loved it!"}
{"text":"The owner and staff were very attentive. The food was delicious from the appetizers to the desert. Portions are substantial so come hungry or don't over order as I did."}
{"text":"This is authentic, the whole family lives in the restaurant sort of middle eastern sit on the floor if you want or at the tables kind of place.  The food was good and I would go there again."}
{"text":"The Chicken is melt in your mouth!!! It really is just like chicken flavored butter!!! This is my favorite chicken dish all year!!!! The rice is so fragrant and cooked to perfection! Bright yellow with lots of saffron flavor melded with onions garlic and thyme. They serve a sauce that reminds me of Italian dressing but is so different, I cant put my finger on it but its herbalisious and addictive!!! Start with Hummus and house made pitas, and give them some time to prepare your meal. You don't have to love middle-Eastern cuisine to enjoy this place. Just relax and let them serve you, Its all good

Service is kind and welcoming, these guys get it. the restaurant is approachable and the food phenomenal. plenty of parking and great discount shopping on either side.

This is one of my favorite restaurants in town and if you pass it up its your loss."}
{"text":"Freak in epicly good food, best hummus my wife and I have ever had.  The lamb fell from the in morsels of pure bliss.  Even my picky daughter ate the kabobs and loved them. Say yes to eating here."}
{"text":"This placed changed middle eastern food for me. The most unique and distinct flavors I've ever tasted. I'd recommend anyone and everyone try it out for yourself; you'll definitely go back. 

The sandwiches are an amazing, quick, and super flavorful bit to eat. The space is awesome. There are tables, booths, a bar, a buffet during the day, and areas to sit and eat too. 

Eisa is truly passionate about what he does and he's created an amazing establishment. Check it out if you're looking for authentic, mouth watering middle eastern food!

Your water will never be left empty here. They're on top of it!

~The Water Guy"}
{"text":"The new owners are a wonderful family! The Falafel sandwich is the best I have ever had! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem and apparently very authentic. Definitely worth trying !"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today. The atmosphere was pretty cool and interesting. The service was very spotty despite it being mostly empty. The food took a while to come out, but the middle eastern music videos were completely new and different which made the wait okay. We ordered the chicken kabob plate and the shawarma sandwich. Food presentation was good, the attention to detail was there, the attention to flavor was just alright. The food was cooked perfectly, but the spice just needs to be spiced up a bit!

Not the worst middle eastern food I have ever had, but not the best. I feel like the flavors need a little bit more to tip the scales. Something is missing, I just do not know what. The portions were good, the price was alright and the food was okay. Probably will not be coming back; I'll stick with Princess."}
{"text":"The restaurant is excellent. They have very good service. The atmosphere is very cool. 
They have delicious middle eastern food. For me I really love like their fried fish and the grilled chicken. 

I really recommend it for everyone."}
{"text":"Stopped in to this location on a Sunday afternoon recently on the search for good Falafel. The Phoenix area as a whole has extremely mediocre middle eastern food and there is not a single restaurant in Phoenix I have found to date that can match the heavenly Falafel that is served at Falafel's Drive In in San Jose or the various Zankou Chicken outlets in the LA metro area. 

With previous disappointments in mind we decided to check out Sharazad due to the great reviews it has received to date. 

When we arrived at about 2:00 pm the restaurant was a ghost town. Other than the staff and my girlfriend and I, the restaurant was empty. 

But to make a long review shorter we both ordered falafel plate with a side of rice and fries. The falafel was just right..not too heavy and oily and not too dry like other Phoenix restaurants have a tendency to make falafel. In addition the Tahini sauce was very good and the fries were cooked crispy.

All in all, not bad at all for Phoenix. No where near what I am used to in California but up until time that I escape back to California in the near future it will be my goto place in Phoenix for Falafel."}
{"text":"We were peasantry surprised. The lamb and chicken were fantastic. We started with an appetizer of a variety plate, and we should have stoped with that. But continued on with a few different plates of lamb and chicken. It was delicious and we could not eat it all so took home the leftovers for another meal the next day. 

The staff and service was great. But we did start rather late as the other patrons finished and left before we were done. 
However they were out of desert so it probly kept us from eating way too much. We will be back again."}
{"text":"plz dont waste your time here. my friends from ca & ut are on vacation here. wasted 2 hrs to be scammed. i wish there was a red flag or 0 stars option.

ripped us off, charged us (9ppl) for yogurt & water bottles that we didn't order, didn't even have a reciept or on the menu. just wrote the total on a yellow sticky note. tried to justify himself by saying we ordered it when he asked if we liked yogurt with the dishes and it was brought to us not knowing the yogurt sauce was separate, also charged us for water bottles because they decided to not give us cups of water instead. overall worst service ever and poor management. 

food: great ****
service: poor service, had to get the waiter after waiting 10 min. then another 10 min for the reciept but \"computer was down\" so \"i just wrote the calcutated total on a yellow sticky note\""}
{"text":"This place is located in a sad Plaza.  No activity in the Plaza or restaurant.  We weren't even sure if the place was open with their posted handwritten hours by the door.  Went there during the height of dinner.  Only a few young men sitting on the carpet eating and that was it.  That should have been our clue.  Sat down and asked for ice water.  We were informed there was no ice but the water was cold??!!  Many things crossed off the menu.  I ordered the shawarma and was informed they were out of that.  We both ordered the kabobs.  Service was fairly quick and the kabobs were fine.  The hostess kept checking on us; probably once too many in the time span.  We tried this place on a Groupon so happy we didn't pay full price.  Later that eve, we were drinking water like crazy.  Meat must've been heavily spiced and salted. 
Sorry, we won't be visiting again as there are other Middle Eastern places we like better."}
{"text":"Had an off the menu recommended sandwich, I asked about what the server recommended and she steered me right. Ask for the Arabic chicken, somewhat similar to a chicken Schwarma but with different spices and an interesting preparation. It's filling but won't stuff you and comes with a lot of protein. I prefer it to the Schwarma I've had at other places (not here yet) because it's full of taste and I think sometimes Schwarma can be a little bland. I'll be coming back and hope to learn a bit more of the menu. The dish also came with a white garlic paste sauce that I can't remember having anywhere else. I also had hot tea, and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome food and the owners are anxious to please. My husband a I both had the lamb chop on top of a bed of delicious rice. The food is amazing, the service and attention to detail was great and our party enjoyed the laid back atmosphere. Very enjoyable evening. 
Frances R."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here but no one was around. Not in the kitchen even. Two guys lounging on pillows were the only occupants and they never looked up from their cell phones, headphones, and tea. There was a warm hookah out front, so we didn't know where the staff was. Went to the Peruvian place next door and were greeted warmly."}
{"text":"Thanks for some really good authentic middle eastern food. Great place to try won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went wanting to have a really good Middle Eastern dinner. From what others said the food sounded great. Got there at 740p and was told they changed hours and close at 8p. The website indicated they serve wine and beer but was told they no longer serve alcohol. Not a soul there and they were already sweeping the floor. We just walked out. Too bad. Was hoping for it to be a great neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Great dining experience!!  We took the owner's recommendations on dinner and dessert and really enjoyed the whole meal.  We had Lamb Mandi and Chicken Mandi.  The meat was perfectly prepared, delicately seasoned on a bed of fluffy, multi-colored rice and came with an amazingly flavorful hot sauce on the side.  Very generous portions, quick and attentive service, and very well priced! I don't remember the name of the dessert but it was like warm, sweet corn cake with a creamy cheese center and crushed pistachios on top - decadent!  The atmosphere was friendly and comfortable - clean and inviting.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Firstly let me start of by saying that being an Arab my expectations of this place were going to be high. However when the chicken was cheap quality I knew it wasn't because of this. The Falafel was bought straight from the grocery store and didn't come with any sauces. They cannot tell me they were freshly made. 

I had better expectations by looking at the menu and seeing mansaf which denoted that this place would be at least a little authentic but no.

Never again will I eat from here."}
{"text":"Tasty tasty lamb!  Service was ok and there wasn't much going on for atmosphere.  All was made up for with the taste of the food.  Worth a stop if you are in the area.  Chicken was good, lamb was excellent, the rice was fine but nothing special.  The sauce/salsa for the lamb dish was some of the best we have ever had!  We wanted to take it home and put it on everything!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service!  I will go back for sure. But if you're using Entertainment coupon, ask before you order as there was some confusion. Very attentive service......"}
{"text":"Avoid. overpriced, bland food, and poor service. 

Came here for lunch Sunday @ 1pm. We should have left when I saw the place was completely empty but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt given decent reviews.

Honestly the place should not have been open for customers.  The same guy was our cook/server/host and also seemed to be balancing some babysitting duties.  We had to track him down just to seat us even though the place was empty. We ordered a basic appetizer, sandwich, and entree. Several minutes later the owner came out to tell us they were out of beef and switched the the sandwich to chicken.  Why did it take him so long to realize?  Once we got the bill we then realized that change nearly double the cost of the sandwich somehow. 

French fries were definitely frozen. The chicken being dry and bland was also likely frozen. The rice had no flavor except for a pinch of cardamon.  The only thing decent was the hummus which is expected given the place is middle eastern. There just wasn't much of flavor profile. I again had to ask for hot sauce to help give the bland food some taste but would have been better if they just shared that with us earlier. 

The server/owner/cook waiting on us was nice enough. He apologized that they just opened (1pm but advertised 10am) and ran out of food from the previous night. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because he made a decent effort but really had no right to operate a restaurant to the public given our experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were hungry and wanted authentic food but didn't want to  sit in. This restaurant had fairly good reviews and an option to pick up so I was all in. I arrived to a clean and quaint location with a welcoming ambience. The two gentlemen who greeted me were extremely kind and made sure that I was satisfied with my order. I got home and dove right into a delectable  mouthful of flavor. I will be coming back go dine in and try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Food here is really good.  We enjoyed it.  Kids loved eating on the floor in an authentic way.  We enjoyed the experience. I hope people continue to keep placed like this alive.  Although they do need to work on the ambiance in the restaurant.  That would attract more people.  The foods is good though.  That's the good thing."}
{"text":"For our anniversary my husband (who is Jordanian) took me to this place without expectation. We picked it at random with the Yelp Phone AP... and let me tell you we were PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WE LOVED IT! 

They have traditional seating (Booth/tables/chairs) and they have the traditional Arab seating (floor pillows and a table top), and a nice ambiance to go with. The decor is reminiscent of being in a bedouin tent for hospitality. The menu was easy to read, and the prices so inexpensive we ordered a little of everything in out excitement (view photos). The food was delicious and made to order in a flash. We thoroughly devoured our food like savages that wandered in the desert for days before arriving. No irony that we are in AZ, haha.

My husband is a retired military officer, and very critical of his homeland food, and let me tell you I had to drag him out of the restaurant so we would not be late to our movie!  He was enchanted. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to have an authentic \"Middle Eastern\" experience. The owners are on hand to greet you and make you feel welcomed. Arab hospitality at its best!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch because we had a Groupon. The restaurant was very clean and interesting with a nice decor and  middle eastern videos and music playing.  Had the shawarma chicken and the shawarma beef sandwiches.  If you order before 1:00, you get another $1 off the already super deal.  The food blew us away....it was SO DELICIOUS!!!!  Portions were very substantial.  The prices were so good that we even had enough on our Groupon to add on desert (which was so different and tasty).  We can't say anything bad about anything!  Can't wait to come back and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"The Lamb Mandi was decent and the Chicken Kebab was ok. The Lamb Mandi which was stewed lamb shank was very tender and well seasoned. It sits on top of a base of turmeric rice. Since I have not been to Yemen or the middle east, I do think the food appears to be quite authentic. Good place to try Yemeni food if you are curious."}
{"text":"I will only say 1 thing. Come here on Friday and order the fish!!!!!!!! Best fish plate with rice in Arizona , only served on Friday,So it's fresh. must have dish."}
{"text":"When i first walked in I was amazed by the design and structure. From my experiences Almost all middle Eastern food in town are relatively the same. But By far this is the best middle eastern place here in Arizona. Me and my wife ordered the beef and chicken kabob. The chicken was very tender and the spices were pretty good. 

The best part of the restaurant is the floor seating that makes you feel right at home. This is an old tradition that is very enjoyable if your up for a change. 

I recommend everyone  to visit and try the amazing food and service that shahrazad provides"}
{"text":"I'm from the Middle East and I'm pleased to say the food here taste great and authentic. Their mansaf is very good when they have it available. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is more of an Arabic food kind of place. 

All the Main entrees were good, and you would be hard pressed to find Arabic restaurants that serve the dishes this place provides (so try it all!)

The place is located in a slow plaza, so it does not seem to have that much foot traffic.They could use better signage outside I suppose.

Hope they start getting more traffic, as the food is really good."}
{"text":"Just left with a very happy stomach. . I moved to the US along time ago and the food i had today reminded me alot of the real mandy from back home.."}
{"text":"Great food in a variety of dishes. Beyond kabobs! Pricing is excellent along w great service.  Small and cozy.  Highly recommend."}
