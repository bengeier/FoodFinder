{"text":"This is a little gem! It's like a cenaduria of authentic tastiness! It's Southern Mexico style, the Barbacoa is the speciality. The tacos, soup and steamed tacos were delicious."}
{"text":"This is my second time here to order tacos. Both times I have come my order was not correct. This first time they gave me a extra taco for the error. So today same thing my order was not correct. They give me a extra taco for the error. I advised them my order was still not correct. A guy comes from the back and explains that since they gave me a extra taco I would need to buy the taco they left out for the second time. I left and will never go back. Horrible customer service and poor management. The salsa we recover for the tacos was frozen. Never again giving any business to this establishment."}
{"text":"Very good friendly customer service and the food was delicious. I had the taco combo and was not disappointed."}
