{"text":"I liked it a lot!! Both the salmon and Hawaii bowls were great and tasty. It is a bit pricey given the portions. The ambience is casual and fun."}
{"text":"Okay! This is my new favorite! It's set up like a Chipotle/Subway where you easily through the line letting them know what you want in your \"poke\". From what I understand is a Hawaiian dish, made up of sushi (raw - sashimi type), rise, and many additions. It's fast, it's fresh (sushi flown in frequently), and it's got great flavor! Go try it out, if you're into sushi."}
{"text":"Love this place; I've already enjoyed their food multiple times since they opened. My only complaint is, as others have mentioned, all the plastic. At least for diners-in, please provide real bowls/chopsticks/cups to avoid the waste. Thanks for joining the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Love Miko. Over time, I've customized my favorite which is the Hawaiian minus the avocado, adding spicy oranges and crispy shallots. I recommend half brown rice and half baby greens. The curry vegetables are a great option when I'm not in the mood for fish (add extra toasted coconut because it's delicious). I'm also a big fan of the seaweed salad and chips. For the Hawaiian ice, try the agave hibiscus and you won't be disappointed. I can't go a week without craving Miko!"}
{"text":"Delicious poke. I had the vegetarian (Coco Curry) and my husband had the Hiawaiian. Both very good - a little flavor of Hawaii in Madison! There are a million customization options and the staff is super helpful so you get the perfect bowl. Everything is designed \"to go\" and we will definitely be back for take out. Also appreciated the GM (Ben) coming around and asking for our feedback on their fourth day open for business!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Hawaiian food. The lady was very helpful with choosing a dish. We ended up going with an amazing vegan dish (even though I am not vegan).  The mix of flavors was unlike anything I have had before- a coconut
curry sauce with edamame, fresh cilantro, cantaloupe, and lots of other goodies. It was crisp, crunchy, soft and full of flavor. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hawaiian Poke is outstanding.  Everything else is pretty good.  Good service;  dishes are a little hard to manage."}
{"text":"Prior to stopping in for the first time, I had never heard of poke, but someone described it to me as sushi-in-a-bowl and I think that's a good way of conveying what you're getting into. I opted for the Spicy Albacore on my visit and I certainly wasn't disappointed. The medium bowl was more than enough food for one (and a good bang for your buck) and it was packed full of flavor. I didn't venture out and add any additional ingredients, but there is plenty to choose from and I'd imagine you can create some pretty good flavor combinations on your own if you're feeling adventurous. Everything tastes incredibly fresh and the customer service is very friendly (tip: if it's your birthday, mention it and they may offer you free shaved ice, as they did for my girlfriend).

If you're planning on dining in, make sure to avoid busy times, as the inside is relatively small in terms of seating.

Overall, this is a great addition to the Monroe Street scene."}
{"text":"I have to give an incomplete. The parking lot is a disaster, since the sister restaurant is still under construction. And we only made a quick dash inside to see the menu and try a quick dish for takeout. 

It's a cute setting, and the one dish we tried was tasty. But the prices were a bit of a turnoff. $7.50 for a Small and $14.50 for a large is beyond my budget for a salad or rice dish. The ingredients were tasty, but rice seemed to be the majority component of the dish we got. 

Will try it again when we have time to sit down and absorb the ambiance."}
{"text":"For poke, it was meh. I've had fresher poke in other establishments. The sauces were heavy while other places ive been to focus on the freshness of the poke and complement with light oil. Without the aioli sauce i guess, there isnt much flavor. They don't give you a lot of poke on a standard size bowl unless you pay extra. They do give you size options."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch. I initially ordered a \" small\" poke for 7.50- until I saw how TINY the container was, so I upgraded it to a medium, which was over 11.00. They fill half the container with rice first, followed by toppings. It was fine ( I ordered a shrimp variety) but definitely NOT worth  the price. I won't be back"}
{"text":"Happened to stumble upon this place while trolling online for a light dinner and poke seemed like the perfect healthy option. I got the medium Hawaiian (ahi tuna) with an extra scoop, which came to $13 plus tax. The portion didn't seem that large but they do pack everything in there rightly so it was a sufficient amount for me. I wasn't very hungry, otherwise I would have gotten the large size. The ahi tuna tasted fresh and I loved the sliced scallions included in my bowl. I did need to add extra poke and volcano sauces, which were located at the table for easy access. The wait staff was very friendly. I think this place will do will in the Monroe St neighbo"}
{"text":"The style of the resteraunt is fairly innovative. A choose your own adventure experience, the service is friendly and happy. The food, however, is alright. The raw fish quality is a little lackluster and some of the sauces can be a little overpowering. For those who enjoy salads, this is a fun twist on a classic dish. However, I am used to poke being more of a raw fish dish than a salad. It felt like the rice and veggie ratio was much larger than the fish ratio which made it feel a lot less like poke and more of a salad with fish topping. Especially for the price, it seemed much too pricey for the portion of food you receive. 

On the other hand, I will definitely return for the hawaiian shaved ice. Their hawaiian shaved ice with the agave hibiscus and pineapple flavors is a match made in heaven. The tart agave and the sweet pineapple are perfect."}
{"text":"After London trip, this is the best and authentic Indian cuisine I ever had. I live in Chicago for 40 years, being to most of Indian restaurant in Chicago. This is the only one in Midwest that give you the variety of dishes. If you Want  real Indian cuisine you should try this restaurant with open mind."}
{"text":"Went here the first week it opened and we ordered the Cali Style and 2 Hawaii Style bowls with rice, regular size, plus an order of chips on the side. 

The counter service style assembly was quick. I appreciated the ability to customize our order or even \"make your own,\" as well as the stickers highlighting allergies. Our meals were flavorful yet light, and the chips were delicious. For me, the regular was plenty of food, but my dining companions wished they had gotten larges. 

I'd give it my whole-hearted recommendation, but the price tag is a bit hefty to validate lunches here on a regular basis. I will most certainly be back though!"}
{"text":"As a Hawaiian food enthusiast, I was really excited to see a poké joint close to me, so I popped in on a Tuesday night. Unfortunately, it was a overall pretty disappointing experience. Service is Chipotle-style, with a long bar that the customer makes their way down to customize their dish. I got the \"build your own bowl\" option, which was bland and underwhelming, and the sweet potato chips were over-salted.

Pros:
- Good helping of protein. I got the regular size and ended up with three good scoops of salmon.
- Pretty polite and accommodating staff. Obviously mostly students working behind the bar, but all patient and efficient. They had run out of large sized bowls by the time I got there so they were offering to make one regular + one small bowl to replace it.
- Interesting variety of toppings--teriyaki pineapple, chile-spiced oranges, roasted garlic.
- They have shaved ice! I didn't get one, but it was super nostalgic to see it on the menu. 

Cons:
- SMALL AF PORTIONS. Like, holy crap. For $10.50, I expect an actual poké BOWL, not a poké cup. They were pretty generous with the toppings, and rice is so cheap, so I don't see the harm in just making the containers bigger and adding more rice. 
- Bland, bland, bland. I got the \"spicy aioli\" sauce, and while I understand it has to be somewhat mild for those with tamer palettes, it was essentially flavorless. I had to dump some of extra volcano and poke sauces into my bowl for flavor. The salmon was also a bit rubbery--poké demands sushi-grade fish and this was definitely not anywhere near sushi-grade.

As a final note, I may not have enjoyed this place as much as I could have because I opted to make my own bowl and probably didn't curate flavors super well. I would go back to try one of the \"House Favorite\" combos. But overall, I felt like this place was riding off the poké hype and didn't have much to offer in the way of flavor."}
{"text":"The Hawaii Style was excellent!  The Cali Salmon was good too though not quite as flavorful.  The staff were very pleasant, friendly and helpful.  I asked to substitute snap peas instead of edamame.  The sweet potato chips were delicious too.  We can't wait to go back and try the shaved ice."}
{"text":"The establishment was very clean, the staff very friendly, and the online order experience was  good.  The food was good for what it was, but it just didn't resonate with me.  It kind of seemed like everything you might order at a sushi restaurant all mixed up in one bowl, with a lot of sauce.  Again, it was good healthy food, I just wasn't crazy about the concept."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first visit to Miko Poke. Loved it. Food was terrific, tasty, filling and satisfying. Servers were helpful and generous with their time. Giving 4 instead of 5 stars because we think the eating experience would be enhanced if the food was served in wide-mouthed bowls. That way we could enjoy the flavors and textures of the entire dish in each bite. As it is served, the \"goodies\" are eaten first because they are on top and it takes a while to work your way down to the poke and rice."}
{"text":"I've been back 100 times since September, well not really but several times. A few updates on my previous review and subsequent trips. Miko Poke is a fantastic option for a light and speedy dinner. Having a quality on the go \"sushi\" option is a fantastic addition to the Madison area. Unfortunately, they must have order their horrible to go containers in bulk because they're still using the deli style containers. 

When you have multiple guests commenting on this and guests changing the way that they order your food (medium in a large etc) you know that you need to look into new options. I agree with previous reviews about the slow service and the lack of flatware for eating in options. However, given the laid back feel and counter service concept I am simply happy that they have free water!  

Since opening in September, there are few new faces in Miko but the employees are still really dreadfully slow. I've looked into ordering online but having to pay extra is lame and am therefore forced to wait (entitled millennial). 

The Hawaii style is my favorite of the pre-designed bowls for customers to choose from. I highly recommend adding melon to this and promise that while it seems weird you wont regret it. After adding the melon skip the onions and add the fried shallots. If you are getting yours to go, ask for the shallots in a side container so they don't get soggy. Don't waste your money on the pricey but lackluster seaweed salad but do splurge and get their sparking lemonade. My previous review was a little critical and I have since fallen in love with this light beverage! 

I can write these reviews all day on YELP but the truth is that I don't frankly care that the employees are slow and the containers suck. Their Poke is consistent and flavorful and I will keep going back! The only thing that I could think to add would be some yellow tail!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I've been to Hawaii and had real poke and this place gets it just right. Great food, the service is awesome, and the prices are good too. I'm definitely going to make this a regular spot."}
{"text":"This place has a fun and original concept! It's unlike anything else available in the Madison area. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. I've been twice now and the service is always super friendly and helpful, with the staff happy to answer questions and give recommendations. It's definitely on the pricier side, but I think it's worth it for the freshness and quality of the ingredients. The purple sweet potato chips, available by the register, are salty and super delicious. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Miko three times now and will be back for more.  I've taken off one star for the fact that my take out order of \"Hawaiian style\" was clearly made wrong...it was just tuna and rice and no other toppings.  Sad night for me.  The other two were great.  Fresh fish, perfectly cooked rice, flavorful sauces and toppings.  Highly rec adding the crispy garlic!  They let you customize everything.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I plan to eat this everyday for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Great find for us, West Coast transplants! Quality of fish was delish...however, we have some suggestions!
-Portion of fish could be a tad bit more...weighing the fish would be more precise. 
-Mixing the fish with the sauce(s), and toppings in a stainless steel bowl and then turning out into a reusable bowl, lined with rice or mixed greens and garnished! MUCH easier to eat, taste all the delicious ingredients and would be greener, too!

Either way, we'll be back! YUM."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed with my order. The fish was horrible, not fresh at all, nearly inedible. Would have been upset that I paid for an extra scoop and didn't get one, but I could barely stomach the bit that I got."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try this place.  Did so tonight.  Tried the small Hawaiian.  Good, but pricey for the size.  The Tito's Shaved Ice Moscow Mules look good."}
{"text":"Loved it!! Fresh amazing taste! I will be back!! I think next time I'd love to try just all ahi tuna instead of the rice. But it was awesome and the sparkling lime aid rocked!!"}
{"text":"I love Miko Poke.  It's basically sushi in burrito bowl form.  The people working there are so nice about explaining the whole process, and they have really delicious toppings and sauces.  I normally build my own, with tuna and salmon.  I do wish that the rice to fish ratio was a little better (preferably more fish).  They also have REALLY ADDICTING purple potato chips.  If you go, I'd 100% recommend you try those chips.  One other downside is that they don't mix up your food, so sometimes it's hard to get a bite that has more evenly distributed fish, rice, and veggies.  Overall, I do love poke, and I'm overjoyed that we finally have a place to eat poke."}
{"text":"Some of the most tasty fresh seafood bowls I have had in the Midwest and down really good food. A little on the pricey side for the quality but still very good."}
{"text":"A Chipotle for Hawaiian sushi!  Order your own creation or supplement the already designed dishes.  I had the Hawaiian poke and it was outstanding, very fresh and tender tuna.  The sides were very flavorful as well including the sweet potato chips.  Give this a try you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and it did not disappoint! Service was very fast and friendly. You can be seated with your meal within a few minutes. I am a huge fan of raw fish but am currently pregnant, so unfortunately I can't speak to any of those bowls (yet). They have a few options for those who can't or don't want to eat raw fish, so no worries if that isn't your thing! I opted for the Banzi Shrimp. You select your base.. white rice, brown rice, or greens. I got half white rice, half mixed greens and unless you're someone who needs to eat a lot of carbs to feel satisfied I would definitely recommend doing this - great ratio of everything in the bowl. I added fried garlic, which was delightful! I felt that my bowl was just a little bit dry, so I added some of the poke sauce from the bottle on the table and really loved the flavor of that sauce. I know they are also happy to make any substitutions you may request, as the concept is that they build your bowl right in front of you. My girlfriend got the Hawaii style but wasn't in the mood for ahi tuna and they happily subbed chicken for her. I love that the meal was delicious and satisfying with unique flavors that aren't super easy to find in Madison. You'll have no gross sensation of fullness or feelings of regret after a meal at Miko Poke!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. You know how sometimes you try something and then you constantly crave it? Your mouth waters a little every time you think of it? That's Miko Poke. It is like an amazing bowl of sushi. Like, the most delicious \"special roll\" you've ever eaten, deconstructed in a bowl, and you can actually get full for around $10....which would never happen with actual sushi rolls.
My husband and I don't get date nights very often and we should try new places. But it is VERY hard for me to resist the Hawaiian bowl at Miko Poke. And whatever the Poke sauce is that they have at the tables...I think it's made of dreams and unicorn tears.
Also, try the house-made chips on the side. They are amazing."}
{"text":"Delish. Employees did seem a little nervous making the bowls but give 'em a break, they're brand new. But they were friendly and extremely accommodating, willing to answer any questions and you could really tell they were doing their best. I'm already counting down to when I can go back."}
{"text":"Point blank, the large bowls are expensive for the sizing. But, you wouldn't spend more here then you would buying a few rolls of sushi, so it's worth it. 

I built my own bowl, and really went ham with the unlimited toppings. White rice and ahi tuna as the base, cilantro, poke sauce (some kind of soy concoction), edamame, mango slaw. 

They stuffed it so full which was awesome but difficult to blend together with the rice at the bottom. It needed up being two small meals for me, but I recommend eating it all fresh in one sitting. 

Bonus: the jungalow decor in the restaurant with the plant print seats gives off good vibes."}
{"text":"From the minute we walked in, and throughout our visit, the employees were incredibly friendly and hospitable offering solid suggestions, answering questions, etc. Very impressive.
 
My entire party of four enjoyed their selections.  I got the regular sized Hawaiian (ahi tuna) on brown rice.  It took a few minutes for the crew to assemble (lots of removing of lids) but upon digging in, it was thoroughly tasty--a good balance of fresh ingredients and flavor.  Though the ingredients seemed to be quality, I felt the price was a bit steep considering the serving size (and being roughly 2/3 rice).  But I get it, it's raw fish.  Perhaps I'd have paid a comparable price for an equal amount of sushi.

To me, the bummer is all the plastic--bowls, cups, and utensils (minus the wooden chopsticks).  It would be nice if there was a real bowl/utensil/glass option for dine-in.  Perhaps there will be once the adjacent restaurant is completed? In the meantime, biodegradable/compostable containers would help."}
{"text":"Ahi tuna poke was amazing! So glad that this exists in Madison. Would highly recommend stopping by! Especially for the fish."}
{"text":"Miko Poke is definitely a great place to go in Madison. Everything is super fresh and delicious. My favorite bowl is Hawaii Style with all of the veggies and extra avocado. They recently changed their bowls and chopsticks to be compostable. The bowls are now big enough to stir the contents without spilling, which makes an already awesome place even better."}
{"text":"I went to Miko Poké in its first week of opening, and I was generally impressed!  They have a wide range of fish & toppings to choose from, and it's a perfect place to go for a light lunch.  As they are just starting out, I'm sure there will be some kinks to work out.  My rice tasted a little underdone, but this didn't detract much from the meal overall.  Anyone who's looking for a new lunch place to try out on the west side should try Miko Poké!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a poke place in Madison! This one does not disappoint! So fresh and delicious. We went for lunch and my husband asked if we could come back for dinner. Dying to try one of the cocktails, too. Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I write this, as I sit here wishing I had a poke bowl to eat right now. I visited Madison over the weekend and my friend told me about Miko Poke like a week before I was coming so to say I was excited is an understatement. I had looked over the menu before (obvoiusly), and was pretty set on the Hawaii Style bowl. Lucky for me, my friend also likes to share so we got the Hawaii Style bowl and the Cali Salmon bowl. Apparently, if you're a newbie to Miko Poke, they usually suggest the Hawaii Style Bowl. There's a bunch of other bowls that look really tasty too, but I was really happy with our choices!

Everything is very easily customized, so if there's one ingredient you don't want, or one you want more of, they can easily help you out there. Whatever sauce is in the Hawaii Style bowl is HEAVEN. I couldn't put the thing down. The Cali Salmon was good too, but compared to the flavor of the Hawaii Bowl it seemed bland. The fish is nice and fresh which is the most important thing I look for. 

Service is great. The staff is really helpful and patient as they create your bowls. The atmosphere and vibe in there is really cool too. The middle long tables are long surfboards, and it's just super colorful. Now I wish we had a Miko Poke in Minneapolis.. because now I just want to keep going back to Madison for this!"}
{"text":"This place is really special -- it's hard to get poke like this in the Midwest.  Yes, you can order things that are similar at some sushi restaurants (ie. ahi tuna salad) -- but it is not the same.  This was really tasty -- nicely done."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after seeing photos that a friend of mine posted on social media of her \"Hawaii Style\" bowl. It was a chilly, cloudy, day in Madison so I thought to myself... \"I could use a little aloha in my life today\". I was greeted by a very pleasant lady who asked me if I had any questions about the menu. The bowls are made to order - You can choose from the menu, or build your own bowl. Since that fateful day, I have returned many, many times. Very tasty and prepared nicely. All of the sauces are both dairy and gluten-free.You can choose from a variety of fish (ahi tuna, salmon, albacore), as well as shrimp and chicken, or just straight up veggies.

You can order online and pay ahead of time so that your meal is ready for you to grab and go!"}
{"text":"I have now tried 2 of their House Favorites and am officially obsessed! It is a good thing I don't live closer or I might be broke from eating here all the time. Yes, it is a little pricey, but you actually get quite a bit of food for what you pay for. I can't wait to try their adult-style shaved ice.

My favorite is the Hawaii Style but the Cali Salmon was delicious, too. Next to try is definitely the Banzai Shrimp. Don't forget to add crispy garlic!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I can fairly rate this place, because I haven't had other poke here in the US.  The poke we had here was so over loaded with with mayo. I know they call it aioli, but it is just mayo with something added.  The tuna was probably good, but I couldn't taste it.  There was so much mayo.  You should note I asked for just a bit of aioli and in comparison to my wife's I did get less aioli.  The rice was ok, but it wasn't anything special.  I wanted so much to have some decent poke."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here! We were greeted and they explained poke to us and were very friendly and helpful. I ordered the Hawaiian (tuna) and my husband ordered the bonsai shrimp with brown rice. The quality of the proteins was top notch sushi grade. All of the toppings were fresh and delicious. It was nice to have sauce on the table, since my husband always loves extra sauce (he LOVED the volcano) but I thought there was plenty. People have complained about the prices, but considering it's basically deconstructed sushi I think the prices were very reasonable. Light but very filling. Will be visiting frequently!"}
{"text":"The poke gets three stars, the restaurant gets four because their shave ice is so good!

I've visited four times at this point, all for lunch. Three out of the four times I chose one of their curated bowls, all were just okay, but I would not recommend the teriyaki chicken bowl. It is definitely worth it to go the seafood route! The last time I went I chose to create my own and that was by far the best tasting! I will definitely opt to make my own on future trips. 

I have had the shave ice once. I chose two flavors, matcha and strawberry. The strawberry flavor tasted very fresh, not artificial at all, but was a little too sweet for me. The matcha was a slam dunk. So good! I will definitely choose matcha in the future, and possibly branch out to try other flavors.

Now that I have finally figured out what to order at Miko poke I look forward to returning again and again!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times in the last few months. There's no place like it, and the food is delicious. I stick with the Hawaii style. 

The prices are what they are. It's not a cheap lunch, but I'm comfortable with the value when comparing it to a couple sushi rolls. When I'm really hungry, I need the large bowl which is about $15."}
{"text":"Tasty, nutritious, fresh fast food. Fun, kitschy atmosphere. Slightly overpriced. Not happy with plastic containers for eating in, but the manager told me their working on it. I'll definitely go more if they figure out how to be more environmentally friendly."}
{"text":"Man did the food look delicious here. However we were only looking for a sweet treat and just ordered the shaved ice. We were thinking of returning for dinner but didn't. 

I would describe Miko Poke as an Asian spin on Chipotle. All of the ingredients are in front of your eyes and you choose if you want a bowl and what you want your base and added ingredients to be. 

There were lots of VEGAN options including tofu and yummy veggies. 

I can't speak for the taste because I didn't order anything but it looked really delicious. 

However I can speak for the shaved iced and is slightly pricy for what it is but definitely satisfies a sweet tooth. The flavors are unique like hibiscus and passion fruit, etc. 

The syrups are more natural thus are better for your health compared to the traditional snow cone. 

If you're looking for Asian inspired food that has plenty of VEGAN and healthy options I would recommend Miko Poke."}
{"text":"Not liking the menu and layout changes since the start of the year. More wait time for food. Part of the fun was watching the poke bowl artists at work. Still tasty but missing my coconut curry and the homemade chips."}
{"text":"We are Vegan so this place seemed like a good option for us so we gave it a try.  When we walked in trying to figure out what we wanted we discovered that a large portion was 14.95, which was probably a quart container and half of it was rice. That's the biggest reason I'm rating it as a 1.  If I ignore the price I would give it a 3.  We were hungry and were tired of trying to find a place so we went ahead knowing we were going to spend $50 for the 3 of us. The Curry I got was pretty tasty but nothing out of the ordinary.  They were out of the curry and went to get a plastic quart container out of a cabinet and dumped it into the bowl on the bar.  That made me feel like I was getting leftovers and it didn't look very fresh.  The one positive was the toppings at the end were unique and tasty.  We got 3 Quart containers, half of each was rice and with a tip it came to $48.  Also, the build your own bowls had a small number of items to chose from, some were unique but there just wasn't enough especially if you're spending $14.95."}
{"text":"My first visit to Miko Poke. What a wonderful place to have lunch. The concept is similar to other Mexican fast food place. Build your own or start with theirs. 

The food is fresh, service is quick and food is delicious. Price is average but all in all a great place to grab fresh food. 

I tried the Hawaii Style as recommended and will definitely repeat it."}
{"text":"Our group of six tried Miko Poke last Thursday evening. Poke is basically a raw fish salad of Hawaiian origin. The poke served here included your choice of tuna, salmon, cooked shrimp or albacore, served in a container with white rice, brown rice, greens and your choice of veggies, fruits, and dressings.

I ordered the Hawaii Style which consists of ahi tuna, avocado, cucumbers, edamame, poké sauce (soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, garlic), garlic chile oil, spicy aioli and I added crispy garlic. The tuna was incredibly fresh and delicious. The brown rice was nutty but too salty for my taste. After eating some of the veggies off the top I was able to mix it all together and then each bite really melded well and burst with flavor and texture. We also ordered the Spicy Albacore with the Volcano Sauce. This was also tasty but just too spicy for any of us. The Purple Sweet Potato Chips were crunchy, salty, greasy, and very tasty. I also enjoyed the Sparkling Limeade. 

It's an order at the counter restaurant, and the woman who took our order was very friendly and super helpful offering lots of suggestions such as mixing the brown rice with greens. They also came out mid-way through our meal to check on how things were which was unexpected for an order-at-the-counter restaurant.

It was packed when we arrived around 7:30, but by the time we left it had greatly cleared out. There's not a lot of tables, so be prepared to take it to go.

I will definitely go back. This was a unique dining experience with a food I haven't seen anywhere else in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Not Family Friendly.
Tried out Miko Poke for the first time for Friday night dinner. 
Positives: Line was longish but moved quickly. Staff seemed really nice. Food was super tasty. We really enjoyed our meals.

Negatives: Restaurant is not inviting to kids at all. High tables with wobbly high chairs were a challenge for my 3 year old. Not enough booths. Not enough high chairs. No high chairs that were tall enough to reach the very high tables. No changing table in the bathroom made taking care of my baby's needs difficult."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's absolutely delicious, gluten free and they have vegetarian options. They stay true to the Hawaii theme all the way to the beer and shaved ice."}
{"text":"Great selection of ingredients and tasty food, but pricy for what you get (especially if you are hungry)."}
{"text":"First experience was great.  Good concept, good fish, nice staff, cool place.  We got the Hawaiian and Cali salmon.  Both were good, but the Hawaiian was better, we will definitely be making a return trip soon."}
{"text":"Ok...just came back from lunch!  Love, love, love that we have a poke restaurant in Madison now!  Every time I've been to Hawaii, I literally eat poke every day!  Love the stuff!  If I could bathe in it, I probably would...

The decor is clean and simple and you order either a S, M or L and the style you want (pre-designed recipes) or just the way you want it. I got the Hawaiian style poke over rice and it was delicious and flavorful.  I was glad they had spicy sauces on the table because I wanted just a little bit more kick.  The fish was fresh and looked fantastic. 

What is also awesome is that they have an authentic Hawaiian Shave Ice Machine!  I didn't have one but will when I go back.  I saw a sign that in a few weeks they will get their alcohol license and will be able to serve VODKA on TAP-mind you!  This will give you the option to booze up your shaved ice to the next level!  Excited to experience one of those.  

I will be back and it's a great, quick place for lunch. Takeout is easy."}
{"text":"Bringing the poke tradition to Madison is fantastic! Fresh, clean food with tons of flavor is always a welcome addition to the Madison food scene. I had the Spicy Albacore poke and enjoyed the the interplay between the fish, jalapeno, cucumber, garlic, ponzu sauce and sesame seeds. I agree with other yelp reviews - it is all the great tastes of sushi in a plastic bowl that is overflowing with goodness!  

That said, I had wanted to try the Hawaii Poke but they were out of avocado. They were also out of vodka for a Moscow Mule and their house-made chips. While apologies were offered, I was disappointed. Oh, and wiping down tables and ensuring areas were cleared did not happen while I was there. The staff were too busy helping customers. Avoid busy nights and you should be Ok."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating poke, and I had high hopes. Miko Poke delivered! Staff was very thorough in explaining options, and the menu options were great. My husband and I shared the spicy albacore and the Hawaiian bowls-we loved both! We agreed that we felt full but not heavy, which was a nice change for a normal Friday night meal. We also loved the counter service, sometimes you just want something fast and yummy. I also highly recommend the Hawaiian tea!"}
{"text":"I'm really happy they have a poke place in Madison, and it is yummy! The fish is fresh and you can get as many toppings as you want. For the base, you get a choice of white or brown rice or baby greens - half rice half greens is the way to go! Some favorite toppings of mine are the avocado, scallions, fried garlic, and pineapple. The one food complaint I can think of is that the first time I had Hawaii Style, and the poke sauce was super salty, so I've stayed away from that since. It is also pretty pricey, and the small size looks tiny, but it fills up so its actually not too bad."}
{"text":"Not alot of options for poke in Madison. Miko Poke is a pretty good place. We ordered the Hawaii style poke bowl. They are pretty generous with the fish, and the fish tasted fairly fresh. We also tried a passion fruit and ginger lime shaved ice, which was a little bit too sweet for my taste. The bowls are a little bit pricey, with a large coming in at about $15."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the new set-up.  The other way you ordered was way more efficient.  We stood in a long line for 10-15 minutes before we even ordered.  One of our orders was wrong and they seemed under staffed."}
{"text":"This is a great healthy option for lunch. We came through from Chicago, and this place is our first stop. Wonderful customer service. And food looks fresh, and the restaurant is clean.  I ordered banzai shrimp and my friend ordered the cali salmon. Both bowls were a refreshing change."}
{"text":"When your thinking about coming back before you've even finished your first bowl you know it's good. Fresh, made to order, and fast. It looked like there was no seating when we went through the line but by the time we were done they were empty seats. They had ice cold courtesy water at the end of the checkout"}
{"text":"A clean fast casual restaurant with friendly staff and delicious, fresh, and healthy food. They offer small, regular, and large bowls with your choice of their special combinations including ahi or albacore tuna, salmon, shrimp or vegan options with yummy sauces and veggies on top of brown or white rice or just salad greens. Beverage options include coconut water, sparkling lemonade, Hawaiian beer, titos vodka drinks and more."}
{"text":"Poke has finally hit Middle America. Or at least something like poke. I think most people will have an experience in line with their expectation. If you're looking for true poke I think you'll look at your plate and scratch your head a bit.

The food isn't bad by any means but it's a bit - let's say - different. I tried the Hawaiian and the Cali. The bowl is filled with too many eclectic (or odd, depending on your perspective) ingredients. If you keep an open mind, this may be a new culinary experience. But if you're looking for something you may find in Hawaii, these are foreign invasions into your plate's flavor profile. I had the rice base. The rice came soaked in sauce. In traditional poke, the sauces and ingredients are mixed with the fish and served with the addition of rice or other starches. Often the rice helps smooth out the intense flavors, but I found myself here avoiding it.

My suggestion? Try the place. Try the different options. But what I would do (as I will do next time) is to take advantage of the build your own option. Get the ahi tuna, a rice base, ask them to put the poke sauce on the fish only, top it with some sesame seeds and scallions, and call it a day. 

That's my plan for the next visit and I suspect that will raise my rating to four stars. In the meantime, kudos to the owners for bringing this to Madison and the patrons for trying something different."}
{"text":"This place is very small. Like a Subway sandwich place kind of small. The staff was very nice. Explained to us what we needed to know. We could make our own but the three of us decided to go with the favorite choices. Hubby got the Hawaiian , med size. I got the same in large. It didn't look very big. Like a subway place, you can customize. Like with sauces or veggies. My twin got the curry one. She said support to have coconuts but only very few were found. 
Next time, I'm getting a med size. And try their shaved ice. The Poke' was very flavorful and very filling. The only beef I had was the plastic cups. Wish they were more like a bowl shaped, so I can get to the rice with the goodies on top.I didn't care for their Hawaiian tea. Taste like medicine. Maybe too much mint or something."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Never had poke before.  It's like sushi in a bowl.  I ordered the Hawaiian.  Ingredients were fresh and brilliant when mixed together.  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of Miko Poké, and I am excited to report that I was pleased with my experience.

I ordered the Hawaiian House Bowl (ahi tuna) in the small size. I chose 1/2 greens and 1/2 rice per the servers recommendation. I ate the bowl as it came prepared and it was positively delicious! The ratio of base to toppings was very good in the small size. My dining partner, however, ordered the large size and that appears to be mostly rice and not as many toppings. 

The dining area was very clean and pleasant. The only downsides I noticed was the price and the ratio of the larger bowls. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love enjoying poke while in Hawaii so I was stoked to hear of Miko Poke opening in my neighborhood. Overall, I really enjoy the restaurant. It is more expensive than your average fast-casual spot but you are paying for fresh seafood so it makes sense.

Pros:
*fresh ingredients and compostable bowls
*DIY bowls with greens option (instead of rice)
*monthly specials always look good and are inventive

Cons:
*Every time I've gone in they've been heavy handed with sauces and certain toppings. Even when I said light sauce they gave me a ton of Poke Sauce which is SALTY. They also dumped on about a half cup of crispy garlic which is just too much. My tip to management would be to train staff to go lightly on toppings unless asked otherwise to really let the delicate flavors of the seafood shine through."}
{"text":"Solid. Nice selection. Good portion. Although I don't think there was much difference in size between medium and large. It was tasty. I would come back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite quick Friday dinner! I can gorge and still feel healthy. There's three sizes. A small usually suffices but if I'm extra hungry a medium is great. I always choose a house recipe but you can make your own. The ingredients are fresh, crisp, and delicious. Portions are generous. I'd suggest snagging a bag of purple potato chips."}
{"text":"Coming from a girl on a strict paleo diet, this place is the BOMB!  All of their ingredients are freshly prepared in house. I LOVED that I could have a tasty bowl where i could pick the ingredients and there's tons of amazing options that I could enjoy! I loved the vegan cashew dressing and the spicy oranges. I was so happy to find a place that could accommodate my requests and didn't get annoyed when I asked several questions about how things were made. If you're looking for a quick, healthy bite, definitely check this place out. You will pay about $15/bowl for a large."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! We have been back twice since discovering it next door to another great restaurant, Everly, two weeks ago.
The albacore tuna and shrimp is incredible with the sesame ginger sauce over rice. So many great sauces and I love that you can build your own bowl. We are kind of addicted!"}
{"text":"Mmm. I love this place. It's a casual, light or hearty, vegan/meat or fish eatery with lots of character, flavor and ease. Nice to have some shaved ice in summer too! I look forward to more."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  It is not the cheapest however you get what you pay for.  Usually go for the Hawaiian with brown rice.  Have not been disappointed yet.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Always quick service and friendly staff. It's a great deal for essentially a sushi salad. The one thing I'm not a fan of: everything goes in the trash, even if you're dining in. They use paper bowls and plastic utensils and cups."}
{"text":"New favorite place! Ingredients are very fresh, staff are always awesome. Been there 3 times and could hardly contain myself with how good it was."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot for consistently fresh and delicious poke.  The ingredients are always on point, as is the service!  Miko is a staple for my family, friends and me - for good reason :) My favorite add-on is, most certainly, the spicy orange slices - great kick and a bit of sweetness."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and have always gotten the Hawaii style poke.  I should probably try ordering other things on the menu, but it's so good that I find myself wanting it every time!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times already. The Hawaiian is delicious, esp. with the fried shallots/garlic on top. Also tried the California salmon, which is good and tastes very fresh but is more bland. Either way, be sure to mix your bowl well before eating - this makes the whole bowl delicious! A bit pricey though, else would go more frequently."}
{"text":"This review is entirely based on the Hawaii style variant. The others look interesting, but for me this has become a one-dish place (in that I only come here when I get the craving).

Also appreciate the option of having a small, light, refreshing meal since I basically only eat out.

So all that's added up to this being one of my more regular stops over the last year.

Alas, their shave ice wasn't as fine as what I was hoping for, but there was only one place in Taiwan that I actually liked, too...so I'm just picky and you should probably ignore me on this front."}
{"text":"So happy to have a new local fast casual option in Madison - especially one that serves fresh, vegetable-forward food. You start with brown or white rice, add a protein, and then choose as many vegetables, toppings and sauces as you'd like. While much of their menu is typical raw fish poke, they also have chicken and vegetable options. The miko poke sauce is great. I'd buy a bottle of it to keep at home. The only complaint I have is that the vegetarian option is the same price as the protein options. It feels like choosing no protein should decrease the price by $1-2."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong in my book with some fresh and delicious raw fish, and Miko Poke always hits the mark on that one! It's really the perfect summer dinner, especially on those sweltering days in Madison. My first experience was mediocre, but I think that's because I just went with one of their pre-made bowls. Pro tip: always, always get a make your own bowl. I always do the regular size with an extra scoop of fish because why not! Never fear, your gut feeling about what you want in your bowl is going to be just right.

If you're curious, I'll let you in on my very own secret recipe: a medium make your own bowl with white rice (carries the flavors better) and four scoops of fish (one tuna, one albacore, two salmon). Add the poke sauce, the ponzu sauce, and a little yuzu. The toppings: avocado, radish, cucumbers, cilantro, green onion, and Serrano peppers (the peppers are not for the faint of heart, let me tell you. I may or may not start crying at least once every bowl). Garnishes: crispy garlic, fried shallots, sesame seeds, and shake a whole lot of the Japanese 7 spice seasoning and chili flakes on the counter next to the cash register on top. Voila!! The perfect bowl, according to Amanda.

The only reasons this isn't five stars are that 1) they can be really, really slow. Yeah, I know, build your own bowl takes time, but if you've got 5 people in line each getting two bowls with one being relayed over text message or the phone... You get the picture. 2) it's kind of on the pricey side. But hey! For a delicious poke bowl with sustainable fish, I'll splurge every once in a while!"}
{"text":"Some of the most delicious food I've ever eaten!! Great options for customizing. Really fresh and light. Great, unique flavors."}
{"text":"This place really exceeded expectations . Tuna was fresh, the flavor combo of the Hawaiian bowl was awesome. Medium sized was perfect so I'm sure the large would fill up any hungry person happily. Only thing off was the shaved ice, nothing like Hawaiian shaved ice, not fluffy at all."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Food Fight concept. The execution of the food is great and the decor and ambiance are on point. In my opinion they try way too hard on everything, and they do so here as well, but it's not as egregieous as some of their down town location. I wish they would open one up closer to downtown I have to drive to this location.

*Food bowls are inconsistent because of lack of care by employees to level off all ingredient scoops, but oh well!"}
{"text":"Just delicious! The poke sauce was amazing. Ahi nice and fresh, no fishy taste. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Madison! This is a \"must try\"! If you are looking for fresh, authentic, poke this is the place for you. My husband and I have been to Miko Poke multiple times and can never get enough. Their sweet potato chips and seaweed salad are also a delight. We love this addition to the Food Fight family!"}
{"text":"This has become one of my go to spots for a quick dinner.  Delicious food (I usually get the Hawaii style) and the sparkling limeade is delicious as well."}
{"text":"So I really love this place - I mean really like it, to the point where I thought I was struggling with an addiction issue. I think it's the combination of fresh fish, unique veggies, brown rice (or white) and some sauces that I don't even know what's in them but I don't really care because it's so delicious.  Such an amazing change from cheese curds and fish frys - something Madisonians are always craving.

My go to is the Hawaii style bowl. Get everything on it and you can add extras, I recommend the crunchy garlic and the melon.  Ahi tuna, edamame, green onions and some other stuff that makes this a refreshing combination of flavors and textures.  I can't get enough!

I've gone off the grid before and ordered other bowls and they're all really good! However I keep coming back to the Hawaii style and just add or subtract ingredients to customize, which you can also do. I'm dying to try the Hawaiian shaved ice - it looks amazing!  

This place can seem pricey at $15 for a large bowl but it's a treat and worth it. I get friends to buy me food fight gift cards so I can use them here!"}
{"text":"Miko is where I fell in love with Poke. I've always been kinda grossed out/scared of eating raw fish, but after looking at the yelp photos and hearing positive feedback from friends of mine, I decided to try it out! Boy, was I impressed. The first wow-factor is the fact that they are so generous with their toppings. As a proud \"picky eater\", I love a chance to curate my own food experience with the toppings/additions of my choice, ESPECIALLY when avocado is involved. They even have a veggie option (marinated tofu) for veg heads looking for the poke experience. 

Light, healthy, and satisfying!"}
{"text":"We came here this past Monday night, and they had been open for less than 5 days! 

Their poke is served over rice (brown or white) or salad greens. They come in 3 sizes: small, regular, and large. I was going to get the small, but the bf talked me into the regular, which was quite filling. There is a variety of protein including cooked options in case raw fish is not your thing. I came here for the raw options which includes salmon, tuna and albacore. 

There are standard menu items where the staff puts together a combination for you, or you have the option of building your own, which then gives LOTS of choices like the kinds of veggies you want (no additional charge), the kinds of sauces, the kind of rice, etc. - similar to Chipotle. 

A note about the service. When we got here, the line was nearly out the door, but they were efficient at getting us through. However, it wasn't clear which member was filing which order. My bf ordered a preset combination but then wanted to add an additional item or two but couldn't because he didn't know which one was his order. This is not the case if you just ask the build your own since one staff member will make it a point to ask you questions at each step. I'd prefer if the preset combinations were more like suggestions and the staff treated everybody's order as as a build your own.  

The food was tasty and I would definitely come back. We also tried their Hawaiian shaved ice with ginger lime and passion fruit. It was quite sweet, but natural as they make it in house. And here's a tip we discovered Monday: if it's your birthday, you get a free shaved ice."}
{"text":"The Good: I have been to Miko Poke twice now and have found myself enamored with their fresh flavors. Both times I have built my own dish and found myself very happy with the bright tuna and tangy sauce. The poke is satisfying but does not leave you feeling heavy or overwhelmed. 

The Not So Good: The line moved rather inefficiently but I anticipate for this to improve as the staff becomes more adjusted. The price seems high - while the food is high quality, $11 for the mid-size bowl is a little steep for fast casual dining. 

The Highlight: Try the teriyaki pineapple. The tangy flavor is the perfect burst of island flavor on a cold Wisconsin day!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I have to say that while the food is fresh and of good quality, I was quite disappointed. I have been to a number of poke bowl restaurants in California (having lived there for a couple of years) and the restaurant here does not compare at all. The end product looks like a bowl I can make - easily filled with brown rice and vegetables of my choice. In addition, the taste is quite mild and plain. Overall, their is a lack of authenticity in terms of taste and ingredients. 

The nice thing is you can create your own bowl and substitute foods if needed, although this is a common theme that can be found among other Poke restaurants I've been too. I wouldn't pay 10.00 for another poke bowl but would recommend trying this place if poke bowl is something you've never had."}
{"text":"Excellent!

For the uninitiated, the 'poke bowl' concept is a southern California origination and recent fad there, essentially turning Hawaiian poke from a snack or appetizer into a meal by adding a base, such as rice, and toppings, like fruits and vegetables. 

After enjoying poke in Hawaii and poke bowls in California, I'm happy to report that our very own Madison shop is an excellent version of this concept! I've been here a couple times, and although a bit pricey by Madison standards, the poke is a superb-quality sushi grade, as it should be, and the vegetables have always been fresh. 

The concept is fast-casual - you order and pay without any waiter service, and then find a seat to eat. There are a few preset suggested combinations, or you can build your own bowl by selecting a base (white rice, brown rice, or greens), protein (fish, shrimp, chicken, or veggies), sauces, and other fruit/veggie toppings. Beer, cocktails, wine, and homemade sodas are also available.

A couple suggestions/tips:
-Seaweed should be available as a topping/base, not only as a side.
-The 'small' size is a very small snack size, and likely not enough food if you're looking for an entire meal.
-The Hawaiian sparkling iced tea is excellent, refreshing, and very flavorful.
-The fried garlic/shallot toppings are great as well, adding a lot of extra flavor.
-Go here and try it!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went on a date there yesterday. I had Hawaii style, hubby had Cali Salmon. The fish were very fresh. We would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"So delicious! I think probably as good as you can get on the main land. I had the vegan poke bowl and it was awesome. The energy of everyone working there is great, too. All positive people and even gave us a recommendation for other vegan options!"}
{"text":"Miko Poke is probably Madison's only poke stop (See what I did there?). We don't live in a big city in California where the market is just saturated with trendy, more heavily Asian-inspired poke places, so we're stuck with Miko for now. On top of that, Miko doesn't even have that much in common with your typical California poke restaurant. The poke places that I'm used to have a very aggressive selection of different seafoods; I've seen places with 4 kinds of tuna and even raw scallops. Those places also have to keep their value competitive, so they'll usually offer gigantic 6-8 scoop bowls for the same price as a large 4 scoop bowl at Miko. You know what though? The lack of those things is kind of what makes Miko beautiful.

To me, Miko's hipster, Hawaiian-inspired drive in diner vibe, focus on fresh vegetables and a simple seafood selection is so Madison. It's a perfect fit for our food scene, but it still brings something new to the table.

On top of that, the food is good! I love how I can eat something so fresh-tasting with clean protein and fresh vegetables. It's the perfect post-gym meal on the go.

In general, Miko isn't really my favorite place to eat, but it's still solid, and it's hard to appreciate what they're going for. Give it a try if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"This is my girlfriend's favorite place to eat.  What's nice about this place is that it is fast and fresh and we feel good after eating it.  It took me a while to find the right combination of sauces to really make it good for me.  I usually go for the ahi tuna with the spicy aioli, ginger aioli, and avocado aioli.  This combination of sauces works well for me.

This is a great place for good food that makes you feel good afterwards!"}
{"text":"Went here on opening night! The staff was super friendly, helpful and patient when my mind was blown by so many options to choose from! Definitely more of a Cali/mainland style of poké (referring to the many toppings, garnishes and sauces), which I think works really well for Madison. We've been to Hawai'i many times to visit family (& watch the Badgers play), and are so excited to have poké here!!

Hubby got the house ahi Hawaiian bowl minus edamame, and I built my own ahi Hawaiian style bowl with cucumbers, avocado, chile spiced oranges, red onion, pickled ginger and crispy garlic. Hawaiian style = poké sauce, garlic chile oil and spicy aioli. Hubs got it on rice, I got it on greens. Both got an extra scoop. All ingredients were extremely fresh and delicious!! I will go lighter on the sauces next time - they are very yummy, but hid the fish a bit too much. Pass on the avocado too, which is actually a mash like guacamole - it doesn't need it. I definitely want to try the scallion ginger aioli next time, and the coconut curry, and and and...gonna be hard to go lighter on the sauces when they all sound so awesome! The scoops of fish look small, but actually turns out to be more than you think. Pricey compared to Safeway on K?ne'ohe, but reasonable for Monroe Street in Madison. I'll pay it again and again and again, cuz we will be going here a lot. Definitely looking forward to trying the veggie one too!

We got the sparkling limeade which was really yummy, and also tried the sparkling tea which had a bit too much going on - the cinnamon was overpowering for my palate. Stick with the limeade. What they REALLY need to get is POG!! Pretty please??

This is an awesome addition to our city. Thank you thank you thank you!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, slightly on the pricier end since it's seafood and not a common thing in Madison. Would recommend getting your own combo, and if you can take some heat in your food, try to add the peppers. Having that extra spiciness always enhance a cold dish! Go with the traditional poke sauce, skip the aoili, it makes the dish really weird, not sure why they'd offer that in the preset combo. Haven't tried any other sauce, but maybe next time... The shaved ice is a mixed bag, some flavors are great, some are rather tasteless. Couldn't tell apart the difference between mango and matcha, so maybe avoid those... :)"}
{"text":"I had a decent experience here (the staff was nice, it was clean) but I just did not like the food. I ordered the vegan green curry bowl with brown rice, as it is built on the menu. To me, there were just way too many flavors going on (although I would have liked each flavor separately, or maybe a few at once.) Also, they served it inside the plastic containers, overflowing the brim of the top, even though we were eating in. One, this is not sustainable, and two, it was absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to try and eat more than one thing at once without spilling all over. The rice was at the bottom, so if you ate it from top to bottom you'd just have plain rice when you got there. I will say, the alcoholic slushies are good!"}
{"text":"If someone threw out the name Miko Poke when it came to lunch options, I would never say no.  Only one special I had I didn't like, but other than that the place is solid. Love the volcano sauce. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Who knew Hawaiian food could taste this good?  Is it perfect?  No of course not.  My answer to anyone who expects authenticity is, hey, it's the Midwest.  You take what you can get.  But what you get is pretty darn good here.  

It's made to order like most of the new fast casual restaurants.  You walk through line and they add what you want ingredient by ingredient until you end with a bowl of wonderfulness.  Definitely try the Volcano sauce."}
{"text":"Creative menu for sushi in a bowl. Good amount of fresh fish. Good sauces that are not overpowering. The fried garlic and shallots add a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"You definitely get the bang for your buck on the build your own. For a small you get two scoops of fish and then unlimited toppings and sauces. My recommendation for those who want to add anything and everything is to make the base half Rice (the white rice is sushi rice!) and half greens. 

The fish freshness is so-so, and they could be a little more generous on those scoops. The volcano sauce is not that hot but I really like the ponzu sauce (they're both at the table so you don't really need to request them in your bowl). 

I also love how they have biodegradable bowls now! One recommendation to further this awesome step is to add photos of what products go where near the waste baskets.

Service is friendly, place is clean, poke is pretty good, and price is comparable - not much to complain about!!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!!  I fell in love with poke in Hawaii and missed it so much.  Place is spot on.  Pretty, spacious, bright restaurant.  Poke flavors are great.  There's three house favorites.  There's also shrimp, chicken and vegan if you don't want raw.  Three sizes: small: $7.59, regular: $10.50 and large: $14.50.  I got regular spicy albacore with baby greens and it was amazing.  The Hawaii style was yummy too.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Miko Poke has given the Monroe Street area a bit of a fresh life in my opinion. Not that I didn't like the other options down around there, but its nice to have a quick takeaway place that is healthy and really delicious. Both the Hawaiian Style and Cali Salmon were terrific and I'd recommend to anyone that like poke. 

Pro Tip - For a slightly healthier option, skip the aioli and go for one of the other sauces or at least ask for half the amount, sometimes it can be a bit saucy..."}
{"text":"After having being impressed like no tomorrow with Pokeworks in New York, I really went in this joint with some serious baseline!! Suffice to say, I wasn't disappointed :).

The Yayy's:
- Casual and trendy ambiance
- Fresh seafood and vegetables on offer
- Option to Build Your Own (A Must in such places!)
- Epic Seaweed Salad though expensive ($5+)
- Good Sauces to mix and match with 

The Not so Yayy's:
- Price - box - ingredients on offer ratio is a tad on the pricier end
- Speaking of box, terrible idea! As this is mostly a salad offering, it should be provided in a WIDE mouthed bowl to allow easier mixing of ingredients. I had a hard time mixing my rice which was way at the bottom of the large box, with my condiments which were way at the top.
- The portion is on the Stingy side. I cringe when a person is dragging the scoop across the board to avoid that TINY little extra hanging bit. I don't mind paying extra if need be but don't get all miserly on me!!
- Variety of options is less and not very creative. No nori/seaweed or crab-salad or scallop on offer. 

Despite the few niggles, I still thoroughly enjoyed my creation here and will certainly be back for few more rounds of this deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"My first experience with poke.  I tried the ahi tuna, with brown rice, and the crunchy style toppings.  The food all tasted fresh, and the combination of flavors was interesting.  The spicy pickled beets were great, but tended to overpower everything else -- especially the ahi.  If I order them again, I would keep the beets to one side and eat them separately.  My son ordered the spicy ahi with the Hawaii toppings.  He found the poke sauce way too salty for his liking, but would be willing to try something again without the sauce."}
{"text":"ok, my second time was a charm. My first visit I asked what the 2 most popular bowls were, so that's what I wanted to try. Hawaiian and Unami. They were ok. That figures, most people are not food adventurous. My second visit I got the Crunchy and the Spicy. MUCH better!! Especially as on my way out (take out), I noticed the sauces and asked what they were and had some. On my first take out I didn't even see those so my bowls were a little boring. Second try,  I loved both the crunchy and especially the spicy (can't make food too spicy for me!) with the newly discovered Poke and Volcano sauces."}
{"text":"I love having a fresh dining option in this neighborhood, with speedy service to boot!  Poké is traditionally raw, deskinned, and deboned fish (think the fish served in sushi or sashimi) served with soy sauce, green onions, and sesame oil.  However, you can completely customize your bowl and ingredients and there is also a vegan version and a cooked chicken version if you don't like raw fish.  The regular size is the best option for an average meal.  Large you would definitely want to share with another person, small is not enough for the average hungry adult.  I found the average size to be very satisfying.  Alcohol will be served by the end of 2016, but for right now one of their specialty non-alcoholic drinks is the Hawaiian iced tea, which is in the \"sorta sweet\" category with hints of lemongrass and other flavors.

Go through the line, ask for any ingredients you want, or use their suggested combinations. So far I have really enjoyed the house cali style.  Up near the register is some furikake (a Japanese seasoning spice mix) and some additional spicy stuff. Each table also has a soy based sauce (Poke Sauce as it's called) and a hotter version of the poke sauce.

The bowls are satiating but at the same time, you don't feel weighed down. Miko can appeal to different tastes and dietary preferences (vegan, made without gluten, no raw fish, etc).  Nice addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I am always appreciative when a restaurant responds to my review as it demonstrates that they are open and welcome feedback.  They asked that I give them another try and recommended a few other menu items that they thought I would enjoy more.  I did just that last night and opted for their Hawaii Style-ahi, avocadeo, cucumbers, edamame with poke sauce and garlic oil.  My original review discussed the one note taste of the Cali Salmon and I feel the Hawaii Style was more my jam.  The tuna was fresh and tasted delicious.  All in all, the bowl was well constructed and because of the that, I am upping my review a star. One thing to note is the avocado comes more of a spread (vs a dice or cube) and because of this, the bowl can get rather creamy so be sure to add some texture elements (I opted for radish and carrot).  To make it a 5 star is something that I just don't think can work in a set up like Miko Poke-to marinate the fish.  Because of it's build-your-own style, it would be difficult to pull off (as you can opted for a variety of sauces) but the best pokes I've had is when the fish has been marinated in poke sauce.  It is only then that the true flavors shine.  Nevertheless, my return visit has changed my outlook and I will put Miko on my short list when I want to get a healthy quick meal in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening and the place was packed. Because of the Chipotle style restaurant, the wait wasn't terrible though. Got a large brown rice bowl and felt it wasn't worth the double price for the large. Had both the tuna and salmon with lots of toppings. The fish itself was excellent and the toppings were pretty good. However, it felt like fast food and it is quite pricey for such small servings. It was worth a try but I have had better. Would recommend getting all of the fresh acidic toppings for the contrast to the fish. After awhile, the rice just felt a little too overwhelming."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! Just as good as the poke in Kauai! They are always willing to accommodate any special requests or offer suggestions."}
{"text":"This is easily the best poké place I have ever been to(and I would, in fact, consider myself a connoisseur of the art-d ! Mike poké SETS the standard for what a good poké resturaunt should be like. To anyone who eats food: Miko Poké might just steal the spot for your favorite spot to eat in Madison. Any time I go to a new city, I always try the poké to see where the competition is at. Let me just say, they are FAR behind! I have had friends from: Dallas, Houston, Kansas City (Leawood, to be fair), Ontario, Tokyo, Constantinople, Pompeii, Mars settlements, and even my besties from Atlantis all say that Miko Poké puts their local spots to SHAME! (Okay, a lot that is a joke, but my friends from the still existing, domestic cities all say that!) If I can leave you with one last note before yelp finds out I am ranting at 3 am and tries to put a stop to me, it's to try the Honolulu ice tea. Bougie? Hell ya! Tasty? Even more so!"}
{"text":"It's like Chipotle, but for Hawaiian-style food.  It's really delicious and healthy!"}
{"text":"This place is just alright, I like the concept but it was way too overpriced. The difference between a small bowl and large bowl is just rice. It is tasty but I probably won't come back too often due to the amount of food (it's basically just a snack)."}
{"text":"Place just changed. Less options. Less choice. How hard is it to keep pineapple and cilantro on the menu? They must have changed the Ahi Tuna as well. It tasted really fishy. Two bowls for $30 and the bowls were not filled to the top. Ripoff. Will be making my own."}
{"text":"It's a bit jarring to get a Poke Bowl in a supermarket takeout container, as opposed to, You know, a Bowl.  But this was a good tasting concoction that wasn't too far from Poke Bowls I've had on Oahu.  (If only they had Kalua Pork too!!)  I had the Hawaiian with white rice...would prefer the tuna chunks to be larger, but that's just a minor quibble.  The flavors were good and since this is a short walk from home I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm from California so when I yelped poke, I was super ecstatic to even find one here! I like the interior dining and the set up of the restaurant. The workers are very friendly and helpful... but I've definitely had better poke. The taste is so so here and kind of bland in my opinion. I wouldn't mind coming back but it wouldn't be at the top of my list for sure."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place! Their food was delicious, all their staff was very friendly despite the rush, and it was fast enough I could go there on my lunch. It's also worth noting that had pictures of dogs on the walls wearing swimsuits which is worth the visit on its own."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience. I ordered a teriyaki chicken bowl and didn't see the girl put on any teriyaki sauce. I asked about it and she claimed it was under he rice or something weird like that (there wasn't any). My boyfriend had way too much mayo sauce dumped on his bowl. We paid for a sparkling lemonade and there wasn't enough for a full cup but it was just handed to us like that with a shrug. I would never go there again."}
{"text":"Eh. Super expensive for small portions. On a few dishes, they claim to put an \"aioli\" on top, which  pretty much just tastes like plain mayonnaise...eww, gross."}
{"text":"I tried Miko Poke for the first time today after visiting Hawaii and falling in love with poke.
I ordered a small Hawaii style, white rice with ahi. The Small was quite filling and I felt reasonably priced at $8. I was alone so chose to sit at one of the high tops, but I noticed they had large booths as well. I'm definitely going to return and try a variety of combinations. Tasted very fresh and I was pleasantly surprised to find such a thing in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Oh yes please! I finally made it here today for my sister's birthday lunch, and I can't wait to go back! I went with the Banzai Shrimp, which was so delicious - warm rice topped fresh veggies, excellent shrimp and yummy sauces. When they ask if you want extra sauce on top, just say yes. And yes, you absolutely should get the purple sweet potato chips.

I'm a little sorry I didn't try the sauces on the table, but honestly I was enjoying my food so much I forgot about them. Now I definitely have to go back.

When we got there the place was nearly empty, but it was the lunch hour and it quickly filled up. The employees behind the counter (it's counter service) were friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable about their menu options. Service is quick, but when they're busy you'll wait a few minutes. They're great about making changes/substitutions to the bowls. They're made right in front of you, so it's easy to make special requests. 

I'll admit that before ordering I was dubious about the sizes of the bowls. I'm not ashamed to say that the medium just didn't look very big. But no worries, it was actually plenty of food!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to taste the new poke place in Madison. I have tasted much poke from my Hawaiian Japanese American friend's moms, when I lived in LA, and vacationed in Hawaii. I love Poke, but I am so disappointed to learned this is not actually poke. Poke is raw fish marinated in delicious Hawaiian flavor sauce. This was raw fish with sauce on it. Please don't call it poke if it's not actually poke."}
{"text":"My favorite takeout place! Sushi-grade fish, veggies, and rice together just are so tasty without feeling heavy or unhealthy. A medium is plenty filling for me, and I like that they improved the serving containers to make them both easier to use and better for the environment. Everyone I've taken here has loved it as well. 

I wish they delivered to my area! It's discouraging seeing the \"we now deliver\" ads and knowing I don't qualify. Although then I'd probably be eating it twice a week. 

Four instead of five stars because they trimmed down the menu, eliminating some of the add-ons, and I am sad they got rid of the fried shallots and replaced them with fried onions (not at all the same). They also changed the ordering process so it's harder to assemble a make-your-own as you walk down the line; instead, you have to tell them everything up front before paying."}
{"text":"Fresh and fast, it's a great option to have that satiates my cravings for raw fish and veggies.

They have a decent selection of specialty poke bowls as well as extensive build-your-own options. Rotating monthly special is nice as well for a change-up.

Appreciate they have a focus on being green and recycling, as well. 

There's zero-guilt when I eat here."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is so fresh and tasty and I've already been here several times since opening. I usually get the Hawaii style and add a couple more veggies (at no extra cost!) Never been disappointed. I know people complain about be price/portions but I have a pretty big appetite and am usually full after just eating a small. The rice and protein and veggies are very filling but not in a bloating, gross kind of way. The workers are friendly and efficient which is especially impressive with how new the place is. Keep up the great work, I'll be here many more times for sure!"}
{"text":"I had never had poke before this, but I have always been a huge sushi fanatic. There's a few poke places in the Madison area, so I thought I would pick this one because it is a member of Food Fight. The positives of Miko include: Nice employees, very quick, and impressively clean. The food itself is also very flavorful, there is a ton of options to mix and match with, and the fish is very fresh tasting. The only con I could come up with is that the portions are a little small for the price(each scoop is 2 oz of fish I'm assuming with a regular being 3 scoops at 11.50). The place itself reminds me of a cleaner Chipotle making it more of a casual place to enjoy great flavors. Overall, my experience was great, and I would definitely consider coming back for lunch or a quick dinner."}
{"text":"Somehow got into this place the first night it opened and loved it. Got the Hawaiian. Super fresh ingredients and incredibly good."}
{"text":"Sushi in a cup. When I first tried this place out, I was a bit disappointed. I had ordered the Hawaii one with baby greens and the lady has just poured on way too much dressing for my taste buds to enjoy everything together without being overwhelmed. I also tried the Honolulu Iced Tea and it was enjoyable, but nothing to write home about. Went back today to try it again. This time I ordered the Banzai Shrimp and had the lady go light on the dressing. Much better. 

Price is a bit high, but you get a decent amount. Rather than just like plop the baby greens at the bottom with a tiny layer, they stuff the containers with the greens so it's not just a mountain of the extra stuff with like 10 baby green leaves.

Looking forward to trying more!"}
{"text":"Called in an order for pickup and firstly the employee on the other end of the line was very patient and jovial and made my call feel very welcome. Props to starting the experience off right. 

I had a chicken bowl on mixed greens and brown rice California style. The good reviews on yelp for this spot are not just hype. This food was so good. Wow! The crab salad was delicious and melts in your mouth. The avocado spread was scrumptious and creamy. The greens were crisp and fresh and the sauces they use are to die for. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I wish there were .5 stars. 

This place is really really good. The ingredients are FRESH and flavorful. 

I get the Hawaiian style, but instead of all ahi tuna I get half shrimp. It is delicious! 

They have these sweet potato chips... GOOD LORD THESE ARE GOOD!  They are salty and they melt in your mouth! 

My only issue with this place- Been 3 times and two of them they were out of some ingredients... I get that it is all fresh and whatnot, but just plan a little better please. It takes away from the experience.. you sir (or ma'am... it's Madison got to be careful) are one delicious restaurant! 

Other than that...... 5 stars."}
{"text":"If you are craving for seafood and an outlet to let loose your food-mixing imagination, then Miko Poke is for you.

Pros:
- Very friendly staffs
- Generous portion
- Flexibility in building/\"enhancing\" your own bowl
- Amazing purple sweet potato chips!

Cons:
- At times, it can be difficult to get seats
- The bowl size might be too small. I can see some impatient customers might have trouble mixing and scooping their food.

The place might be small and the façade seems ordinary, but do not let this appearance fool you. I went and get both Hawaii Style and Cali Salmon on two separate visits. They are tasty, but the Hawaii Style has the better balance in flavors and choice of ingredients. Their ahi-tuna is definitely better than the salmon, but both are of good quality considering they are located in Wisconsin. I ordered regular size, and they are the perfect size. 

The purple sweet potato chips have a clean taste, although it might be a bit salty for some palate. They go really well as a side dish for the bowls. 

The employees are very hospitable and they allowed me to customize my Hawaii Style and Cali Salmon with other toppings and sauces. This allows me to tweak my meals and make them to something that has every component I like. It is definitely a place worth taking your friends, regardless how picky they are. 

It is rare to see a build-your-own that offers many ingredient choices, and is generous with portioning. They could give the interior brighter lightings, in order to improve the mood. However, the quality of the food does not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place really deserves more of a 4.5, but I'm going to give it a 4 for now because of its relatively slow service. I'll definitely be back here since I'm obsessed with poke right now, but here are a few caveats before you go:

1. Yes it's kind of expensive for the amount of food you get. A large bowl is quite large, and it should fill you up quite well, but it is about $15. A medium bowl seems like most people's go to size, as it's ~$11 and it's a decent amount of food.
2. Like I said above, the line moved quite slowly even though it really seemed like it should be moving as fast as Chipotle/Subway's line. The employees seemed a little too lax considering how long the line was when I went.
3. Poke is basically like sushi in a bowl with a lot of sauce. If you're not a fan of sushi or raw salmon, you may not be a fan of poke. 
4. The location is relatively small, so I wouldn't plan on eating it inside unless you have a small party.

Overall, I really liked this place and I'm glad that the poke craze has reached Madison. I'll be back and update my review as time goes on, but for now it's a fairly solid 4-4.5."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, flavorful sushi-like alternative to a burrito, having the best qualities of both. You choose your ingredients from a vast list, and your poke bowl is made to order. The place is clean and modern with lots of light, and the staff is warm and welcoming. I've been here four times already, so I obviously love it. What would I change? Lose the plastic to-go container serving bowls. They're hard to eat from, when everything is in layers and you have to dig (and spill) to get a nice combo bite loaded up on your chopsticks. Too tall and too narrow. Environmentally, they're also a 'no'. Beyond that, the drink choices are limited to things I don't want (iced tea drink with cinnamon, you're doing too much), and the dreaded Coke products. I'd like to see plain tea, and maybe some Klarbrunn sparkling waters. 

Do go here asap. It's a step in price above a burrito lunch, but you deserve a treat. Be sure to add a bag of house made purple potato chips. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"It was amazing. That's all you need to know.  I could eat this everyday.  Fast service.  Friendly staff.  Fresh ingredient.  Tons of choices/combinations with out having to pay extra for guac if you know what I mean.  This is the kind of food your body wants to eat."}
{"text":"I love poke and I was soooo excited to try this place. I got the Hawaii on baby greens. HUGE mistake. There was SO much sauce put on it that my greens were swimming/drowning in it. It was so salty that I couldn't finish it. My dining partner tried mine and had to spit it out and proclaimed that it's inedible because it was so salty and terrible. Theirs was on brown rice and I think the rice may have helped with the amount of sauce. Great poke doesn't need so much sauce. This leads me to question... Are you trying to cover up bad poke or do you like to force your good poke to a pool of sauce? If you serve in greens, either serve less sauce or MORE greens to provide some balance."}
{"text":"This place is a refreshing addition to Madison. Located close to downtown but not in the middle of downtown there is usually ample parking. 

The menu is like a chipotle style made to order poke bowls. They do have a preset bowls you can get. I ordered the banzai shrimp with white rice. It was fresh tasting and the rice was very good. The ingredients seem like they were very fresh. This is a very good option if you are looking for something that isn't to heavy but still flavorful. Overall I really liked this place, the only thing that was a down fall is there isn't much seating so you may have to wait for a table after you get your food."}
{"text":"Miko Polk is definitely worth the trip to suto-Hawaii. The simple clean Cafe with a dollop of Hawaii theme decor gives the sense of freshness that the entrees have. We both had the \"regular\" size, which is plenty, Hawaiian bowl. AM-A-ZING!! So good and so fresh!! The flavors of the tuna, edamame, sauce, the whole thing was fantastic.  The staff behind the counter also very pleasant and helpful. We will be running back here very soon!"}
{"text":"Yum! What a fun and great place to try out. This was my first experience with poke and I'm glad that it was here. There are a lot of pre-made options to order from, but you can also customize and do add ons to existing combinations, which is what I would suggest. There are so many delicious sauce, vegetable, and seafood options - plus it all tastes decently fresh! I added some pineapple to mine which was a really delightful sweet addition to it. 

It didn't feel like much of a sit-down restaurant though - there isn't a lot of seating and most people would eat quickly at community tables and then leave. I also wish they had some more dine-in options, perhaps in a ceramic bowl or cup for dine-in. It currently comes in a plastic cup, but this is also a good option for take-out orders.

Overall, great addition to the Madison food scene and would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Mehhh, I've been to poke places before. This one is just a little lack luster. The ingredients and flavors don't pop. It's pretty bland and nothing to freak out about. 
The raw salmon is an odd option. In Wisconsin, we are pretty far away from any ocean, so I'm a little hesitant about eating raw salmon. I think smoked salmon might be a better option. 

On a good note though, this is a different option to your everyday cuisine. Worth a try, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I keep coming back here again and again - and it's not only because they're the only poke place in town. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their seafood and the variety/flavor of their sauces. Only a 4/5 because their vegetables could probably be a little higher quality and they could stand to offer a few more options in general. The parking situation also becomes a little difficult at peak times."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent, especially considering that there aren't that many poke places in general, especially not in Madison. The only other place that sells Poke is restaurant Muramoto on King st, but it's not customizable like what you find at miko. I like how they have build your own bowls but the \"scoops\" of protein are so tiny it's kinda sad. I got the large with four little scoops and that made it a little disappointing. Their chips are good! I just wish the portions were bigger for the price"}
{"text":"Totally delicious Ahi Tuna bowl from the favorites menu. I can't wait to try others!  I also had a two flavor shaved ice and both flavors were yummy and others eating a different flavor were also raving about theirs. I'm going to wait and try more when their liquor license arrives (shared by their sister restaurant still under construction next door)."}
{"text":"Food was great and I loved the casual atmosphere. We tried the spicy albacore poke and Hawaiian poke. Definitely a good option for lunch or a quick weeknight dinner. They didn't have their liquor license yet when I visited but I'm looking forward to trying their frozen mule. Will be returning often!"}
{"text":"Delicious poke made from high quality raw seafood. I've had 3 of the different styles so far and they have all been great. Wish they had this downtown so I could walk over for lunch often. Very healthy."}
{"text":"This was a great stop if you like sushi. The food is set up like a subway. You pick what you want in your bowl. 

The fish is fresh and high quality. As are the vegetables. Rice is cooked to perfection. 

They also have a couple beers on tap. 

My only complaint is the atmosphere is a little generic. Fast food but deserves a better decor."}
{"text":"Sushi in a bowl - YUM! Sushi bowls that you can customize - AWESOME! Overall, this place is wonderful, especially if you are sushi lover. Love the concept of sushi in bowls, and I am very glad it has made its way to Madison! Miko Poke is a bit pricey, but then again, this is sushi. 

Try the purple potato chips, pass on the seaweed salad (unless you are super into seaweed). 

I highly recommend adding the crispy garlic and fried shallots. You won't be disappointed!

Pro tip: I like eating there so I can have access to the extra bottles Poke and Volcano sauce on the tables if I need it.

Only complaint: They pack so much food into the containers it can be a bit hard to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing, little gem on Monroe. Don't miss this place, their food is crazy fresh. I had the curry poke which was amazing with lots of veggies. I had the suggested extra scoop of chicken. I ordered a combo of the two drinks together: limeade snd tea, which was delicious. I would suggest a better option for a plate, as the food is served in a tiny bowl and you only get bits of one flavor at s time. Will return and spread the word for sure!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Miko Poke so I stopped by on a whim this afternoon for a late lunch. The regular sized bowl is a good size and filled with fresh good quality ingredients. I tried the original Hawaiian with white rice and had the aoli on the side. The person who started my order handed it off to someone else to finish without passing along my \"no scallions\" request, so I had to repeat myself. Also, I think they both added poke sauce when they had the bowl so the rice on the bottom ended up far too salty to eat. Still, it was a good meal and a nice addition to the Madison food scene.

The one really disappointing thing is that the restaurant uses all disposable plastic: bowls, cups, flatware; even if you're dining in. Given their efforts toward using sustainably harvested fish this doesn't make sense. I docked a star for the unnecessary waste."}
{"text":"I've only been to Miko Poke once. I decided to make my own bowl; it was a bit overwhelming. There are many ingredients to choose from and a variety of different flavor profiles you can build. The bowl I ended up with was a little all over the place. My recommendation is if this is your first time, order a pre-built bowl. That's what I plan to do on my next trip. :)"}
{"text":"The first time I had poke was in Hawaii and didn't think I'd be able to find it anywhere else because of how unique it is. I was super excited to hear about miko poke and headed over for dinner right away when I saw it.

They have the steps listed behind the counter - you choose the size, meat, and if you want it with rice, greens or both. Then you can build your own or pick a style they have. I tried the Hawaii style first (then built my own the next time) - everything is so good! The ingredients taste so fresh. The flavors all support each other and deliciously blend so well together.

Other things: you seat yourself, they call out when your food is ready and you bring it to your table. There is a water station by the door where you can get your own water. When you're done, there are bins for compost, trash and recycling."}
{"text":"I have been there twice for carry out.  I really enjoy the Hawaiian.  The Ahi Tuna Poke is super fresh.  The flavors are exceptional.  I love that it's served over warm rice in a container to go.  I feel that if you ordered too much then you didn't have to worry about leaving any goodness behind on the plate.

I did try the Banzai Shrimp bowl at another visit.  I skipped the volcano sauce as I'm a wimp with hot sauces.  The bowl still had some tingle on the lips because of the chili oranges but it was really good.  I look forward to coming back to explore the menu more and to get a boozy shaved ice.

There is a curry veggie option or you can get a rice bowl without poke, for non-meat eaters."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars before the redesigned the menu. Not a huge fan of the new menu by comparison, but it's still more than good enough. I'll happily grab a quick lunch if I'm in the neighborhood; I just think of it a little more like the Chipotle-of-sushi-grade-tuna than I used to."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch!  Fresh, delish, friendly.  Couple reviews mentioned price seemed high.  It's sushi-quality fish you're looking for - cheap ingredients would not be best ;-).  One suggestion - tell them to go light on or skip the aioli sauce on the Hawaii bowl; it's got a few oily items in it, and aioli felt like unnecessary calories/oiliness to me.  I added cilantro and Serrano peppers yum.  If this isn't a chain restaurant, it should be - great concept."}
{"text":"I used to go to Miko Poke 1-2x a week before I moved to Los Angeles a few months ago. Miko was the first poke place I really frequented so I thought, hey, it's LA, I'm sure I'll find a place on par with it.
Wrong...turns out Miko Poke is a diamond in the rough that still tops my list after trying about a dozen places out here in California. The combination of the amount you receive for the price, the quality of the fish and the freshness and variety of the toppings/sauces is what really sets it apart - definitely one of those \"don't know what you got 'til it's gone\" situations. 
Never tried the shaved ice - big regret - but a mix of the iced tea/limeade was always delicious."}
{"text":"Food is decent. What is lacking is the price and presentation. If you are going to charge $10+ for a bowl, it would be better idea to serve it in something better than small plastic takeaway container. It is quite a challenge to eat out of it when the container is full without spilling it all over the table. Mixing it without spilling would be almost impossible. That's the reason for one star off."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch spot! I love the idea and uniqueness to Madison. The bowls are packed with flavor and I love the ability to modify and customize your meal. 

I am a vegetarian so I cannot speak to the freshness of the seafood or meat, but the veggies are very fresh and crisp. I'm not a huge fan of the serving ware (everything is served in clear plastic to go containers) but there are recyclable bins.  The bowls are a bit small/messy- as they're packed to the brim with your dish which makes stirring your food in the bowl a bit difficult. 

I opt for a delicious mix of veggies and load up on the sauces. If you like a bit of heat, try the volcano sauce at the table. 

Pros: innovative and unique; fresh, delicious food; friendly and knowledgeable staff; vegetarian friendly

Cons: limited seating, disposable serving-ware"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, tried the Hawaii Style bowl and the Cali Salmon. Both were delicious and we will definitely be back often! Loved the Honolulu Iced Tea as well!
Four stars, because the restroom lacked a changing table, so we had to change baby's diaper on the dirty floor."}
{"text":"My son, daughter, and I went to Miko Poke for lunch today and it was amazing! I got the Hawaiian style and my kids both got the build your own.  A regular size is enough for lunch for an adult or a hungry kid; for littler kids, a small would be fine.  We also got purple sweet potato chips and a Hawaiian shaved ice (strawberry and caramelized pineapple) to share. It was all good!  Great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Omgosh yum! New favorite place. I love sushi but I can't eat carbs right now so I love the option of putting everything on top of greens instead of white or brown rice. 
I chose to build my own. I ordered salmon, rock shrimp, tuna (extra $2.50 for another scoop) cucumbers, radish, avocado (no charge for extra), crispy garlic (beware that it is coated with corn starch so I did have to pick most off). I chose the soy sauce and the spicy aioli. I loved it all. The greens do get a little sloppy bc of the sauce but I was fine with it. $13.67 with tax. Not too bad considering how fresh the ingredients are."}
{"text":"I really like this place, only reason not giving them 5 is it is a bit pricey. But everything this is fresh and really good. I just wish I could afford to go more. I think the regular size is the best deal. You can always get an extra scoop of protein if you need more but I always feel pretty satisfied after eating a regular size. I love that it is relatively healthy depending in what you order and staff has always been super friendly. The space is tidy and clean with several booths and bar like seating.

I thought I would like the traditional Ahi tuna Hawaiian poke the most but I really enjoy the banzai shrimp. I think the combo of sauces and veggies is great. I've aslo ordered it with an extra scoop of tuna as well. You can add different toppings and the fried shallots and crispy garlic are a must. I haven't tried it but like that they have a vegan option as well as a chicken poke for others that may not like raw seafood or shrimp. Overall, Miko Poke is definitely a must try in Madison and we will continue to come back for a fresh, healthy meal."}
{"text":"Overall experience was great! The large bowl served might not be enough for some. One quick tip - always request the rice/greens based on how much you desire as it might take up half the space in the bowl leaving very little space for the rest of the goodies! My husband felt the seafood/protein serving was sparse. Must Try - Seaweed Salad!"}
{"text":"Just writing this review, I'm craving one of their incredibly delicious poke bowls. The food at Miko Poke is beyond fantastic. You really can't go wrong with any of the combinations, but I personally love to either get the Hawaii style bowl or make my own. The Ahi Tuna is always fresh, the sauces compliment each other perfectly, and it's a great deal to be able to add as many toppings and garnishes as you'd like! I highly recommend the purple sweet potato chips as well. In a word, YUMMMMMMMM!!!!!"}
{"text":"Like all the Food Fight restaurants in town, the concept and menu is solid and the food is prepared well. You can tell there was a lot of work put into the concept and development of this restaurant. The idea of Poke as a quick serve restaurant is a good one, customers can order a from preselected menu, or build their own, \"Chipotle\" style. (Poke read deconstructed sushi bowl) I ordered the cali salmon bowl from the menu and was treated to a tasty combination of rice, sushi grade salmon, radish, and some other veggie toppings. The rest of the family got the Ahi Tuna which also was fresh and tasty. We had some of the homemade chips on the side some beers and a frozen shaved ice mule.

One comment on the shaved ice, the novelty is delicious and worth the price, however it did tie up the service line, and seemed like it was a hassle for the employees to master, we had to wait a bit to get drinks and then afterwards to get our shaved ice orders as they struggled to master the machine and coordinate the flow of other customers through the line. It was tasty and worth the wait, although I think they could sell more of this through a window with a little more speed.

We will definitely be going back for more, and I can picture getting some to go to enjoy on a picnic st lake Wingra"}
{"text":"Come here if you like healthy food from underwater. They do seafood and they do it good - no nonsense, quick and moderately cheap. Pretty good location and friendly staff. Would definitely come back again for some good eats."}
{"text":"I went to Miko poke because I had heard this is a new upcoming restaurant and everyone was talking about it. I am flexitarian and asked about where they get their fish from. Our server didn't know but the lady said salmon is from Scotland and tuna from California. I decided against it and ordered the Coco curry. My 2 cents: WAYYY TOO MANY FLAVORS. it tasted like a child went to a flavor shop and dumped whatever he liked into a bowl. The veggies were fresh but it was a ordeal to eat them. I like to believe I can eat healthy  Vegetarian food which is  also tasty. Sorry miko poke but I'm sure I can cook better! The bowl was COLD and nothing except rice was cooked. NO GO!"}
{"text":"Wow! Pleasantly surprised! I wasn't sure what to think when I wondered in this evening. The menu is simple and \"clean\" Hawaiian food. I had the Cali Salmon and it was like sushi without the seaweed. You pick each ingredient and they add it into your bowl as they pass along the counter of ingredients. It was a collection of cold food in a bowl and great sauces and toppings (so I was a little hesitant), but it was really tasty! It's really cheap and healthy. I recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"First poke restaurant in Madison and maybe even Wisconsin!  Counter style service with extremely friendly and helpful staff you will NOT be disappointed!  Uber fresh ingredients set this place apart...a killer update to the old Bleuphies location!  Highly recommend the rock shrimp and Hawaiian house specialty bowls!  Also get the limeade for a refreshing sparkling sipper!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food Fight certainly knows their food. Miko Poke is exactly what I wanted! Super fresh and delicious with lots of choices for your poke bowls. You can make your own or choose one of their pre-made bowls. I tried the Cali Salmon and was shocked by how amazing the salmon tasted. Hard to believe I was in Madison! The restaurant looked very clean which is a must in an establishment that serves raw fish. Small bowls are plenty of food and under $10 which isn't terrible considering the ingredients. Afterwards, we got Matcha Shave Ice which is huge for only $3.50, and super yummy."}
