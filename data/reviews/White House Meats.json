{"text":"Extremely well rounded butcher shop with cheeses and various other products such as jams or exotic condiments. Friendly and attentive service. I have bought steaks there for several years, and I am always happy. They have numerous outlets across the city, including one in st. lawrence market."}
{"text":"Great local butcher for the kingsway area.  Good quality steaks and roasts, nice smoked bacon, marinated flattened chicken (teriyaki and balsamic, amongst others )  also a nice marinated boneless leg of lamb that I've had on a few occasions. Wide selection of game meats which I have not sampled widely, also a deli counter, and an assortment of cheeses and sausages (good uncured chorizo for the BBQ!). Frozen seafood and some prepared dinners available. Fresh turkey and ham available for order for Xmas and Easter.   Family owned and run. (Stanley is the man! But also spends time at the other Toronto stores including St Lawrence mkt)."}
