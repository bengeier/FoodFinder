{"text":"Awesome spicy chicken sandwich! Love the popcorn chicken too with the many dipping sauces.  This is a hidden gem in forest lawn. Would love to try the pizza some day looks yummy. Only thing bad is waiting time but well worth it once you stuff your face.  At least your food isn't sitting waiting to be bought."}
{"text":"one word......gross gross gross.  i have had better customer service from a wet mop

the gravy was way too salty. the hot chicken sandwich looked nothing like the picture.  it was made with a leftover overcook spicy patty and bathed in mayonnaise.   and then drowned in salty gravy.  yhe combination was disgusting.   

according to the picture it was suppose to be shredded white meat and open faced. 

gross gross gross.   avoid here"}
{"text":"Haven't tried Fritou Chicken before.  Stopped in just as they opened at 11:00 had a short wait for the chicken to be cooked but was completely understandable.

Staff was friendly and upbeat.  Chicken was tasty, tender, moist with a nice crisp coating.  Price was completely inline with other chicken outlets and reasonable.

Will visit again."}
{"text":"Received a flyer from them so I decided to try it out.  I actually did read a good review of their pizza so I tried it.

It is pretty good. Since its located less than a block from Popeyes I think they could do good if people try their food...i have to yet try their chicken.

Frito I think opened before Popeyes and it's just a small place they do have lobby for sitting.

The pizza was really good. I didn't get to take a pic. Of the pizza but it's worth trying..."}
