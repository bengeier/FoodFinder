{"text":"Reviewed Dish: Beef Noodle Soup and $2.99 Special Bun with meat  Reviewed during: Mon - Fri Lunch time Service Speed: 4 / 5 Cooking speed: 2.5 / 5 Food Quality: 2 / 5 Food Quantity: 3.5 / 5 Price: 3 / 5  Cleanness: 4 / 5  Repeat: NO  The beef noodle soup's presentation is very good and the service is fast. But the moment you bite down to the meat, it's dry, bland and tasteless, I suspected the it was cooked for so long all flavor left the meat. The noodles was not memorable. The Dumpling House in Chinatown had a much better Beef Noodle Soup.  I picked up the $2.99 Take out special - Meat between buns. After ordering, I saw they are heating it in the microwave....and they took a long time just to microwave my bun..... When I opened the paper bag, I saw an ENGLISH MUFFIN with some bits of meat and onion in the middle! Honestly I was expecting a meat between a steamed Chinese bun."}
{"text":"This place has a sweet homemade feel. We had the 15 shrimp and pork dumplings for under $10. Pretty reasonable. They were simple, flavourful and delicious! No special sides or garnish, that stuffs not needed here :)"}
{"text":"Nice dumpings, good size with flavourful filling. We ordered pan-fried pork and chives and pork/shrimp. The dumplings were fully cooked and tasted pretty good with soy sauce and chilli peppers at the table. Overall, an average dumpling house with good service."}
{"text":"Zero stars - Do not recommend  I believe Beijing Dumplings only opened a couple of weeks ago; exciting news that another dumpling restaurant has opened in my neighbourhood. The space is small and cozy. Washroom seemed clean. Open kitchen so your hair will smell of the frying (mine does).  They are offering a 10% off Opening Special. Very small menu: only dumplings (meat or vegetarian), either steamed or fried. 10 dumplings per serving. You can order half steamed, half fried, and combine two different flavours - you will of course be charged the higher price. Each order comes with a small side green salad, and fruit for dessert. They have soy sauce, dark vinegar, and chile oil at each table. The prices range from $8.99 - $9.49 (or thereabouts).  I ordered all pork dumplings, half steamed/half fried. The dumpling filling was bland, so I had to dunk them into the vinegar/hot sauce mixture I made. That's when I noticed that my steamed dumplings weren't cooked; the filling looked raw. I had eaten at least one, maybe two like this. *Insert gulp* The fried dumplings seemed better...but I really wasn't sure. I also overheard another table complain that their dumplings weren't cooked through either.  My server was very polite and immediately offered to bring me a new set of dumplings. This time, I asked for all fried...but when they arrived, I truly only had the stomach to eat about four. I left most of the dumplings untouched. I was feeling a little nauseous and headache-y, but I wasn't sure whether to attribute that to the sun (since I was sitting by the window) or to my soy sensitivity. I started to worry about food poisoning. The server had brought me two complimentary salads - one was a seaweed salad and the other I think was supposed to be picked daikon. The seaweed salad tasted off; the daikon salad had no taste.  All in all, a terrible experience. It has been over an hour since I left the restaurant and I still don't feel myself. But the server was polite and tried to react quickly. It's not her fault the cook didn't prepare the food well or properly. If this restaurant sticks around, hopefully they will get the cooking process corrected asap."}
{"text":"Wow, surprised at the good rating here. The food is really subpar, maybe it was tweaked for non asian. My friend and i had the beef noodle, Tian Jing bun, Chinese burger. We left with the dishes pretty much untouched, they put lots of MSGs in the bun, the noodle was under cooked, not alot of meat, mostly uneatable parts like the skin...etc, and the Chinese burger.. Wow, what a joke...   If its targeting non chinese then its OK I guess... Don't think I'll step in again."}
{"text":"I stopped by Beijing Dumplings during a recent business trip to Toronto.  It is a clean  restaurant with very friendly staff.  Menu is very straight forward.  My coworker ordered pork (w/ cabbage) dumplings and I ordered pork with \"chives\" (should be leeks according its Chinese).  Both kind of dumplings came out GREAT!  Price is awesome too.  For $8 or $9, you get a small dish (pickled seaweed + lotus roots) + 10 dumplings + fruit.  Mind you, we already ate dinner but we finished all of our dumplings anyway!  Dumpling skin/wrap was handmade to a good thickness, and the stuffing is not too fat or too lean either.  Overall, it's very enjoyable experience.  One of the ladies in the kitchen, Veronica, even gave us free samples of her chicken and shrimp dumplings to try after I chatted with her for a bit.    My coworker and my return flight was cancelled due to poor weather, and guess what?  We went back there AGAIN straight from the airport.   Personally I don't care how bad a restaurant is during its opening quarter.  Top chefs restaurants don't earn a Michelin Star anyway.  It takes time to sort out all the kinds in equipment, staff, and logistics.    Anyway, if you like dumplings, definitely go check out this place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place is relatively small, but surprisingly comfortable and decently furnished. Like many have said, the menu is very simple, pretty much just dumplings, wontons, and a couple of noodle bowls available. You can get dumplings as steamed, fried, or boiled. Me and my friend tried all three, and the verdict is boiled is the best! It's juicy and more flavour filled when eating dumplings boiled.  We got pork and fennel, pork and leech, and chicken. They were all pretty good, dumplings are fairly large too. I wouldn't say they would be dumplings that would blow your taste buds away, but the quality/proportions of meat and veggies are definitely there, just that the taste could have been better. The dumplings do seem costly at first, (around 10 dollars for 10 pieces), but it comes with soup/salad and fruits as dessert. The soup FYI was hot and sour soup and once again, the quality of it looked really good, but the taste was a little off again.  I'd say the best part of this place is probably the service, the server was very attentive, kept feeding us tea, and was very polite, saying YW everytime we said TY. It's probably the service that made me feel like this place deserved a 4 instead of a 3. Not bad at all for a quick eat to fill you up while you're in DT TO doing your business."}
{"text":"$6.99 for 10 pork and cabbage dumplings for lunch special.  They were pretty tasty..  Except halfway through my plate of dumplings, I did notice some stray strands (TWO) of hair on my plate - not near the dumplings, but on the edge of the plate... not impressed...  I also noticed some people got complimentary potatoes (?)"}
{"text":"Okay dumplings, but overpriced. Walk 10 more minutes and go to Chinatown for more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I'm a Chinese that has been Canada for five years, and this is the worst Chinese restaurant I have ever seen so far. They have no ideas how to cook. The Spicy Pot on their menu shows a picture with lotus and other stuff, but the they only serve you a small quantity of potatoes and celery, and six or seven shrimps, which asks you for $15. And it is tasteless. rofl"}
{"text":"come here with fds. the dumpling was really good. no msgand the kitxhen is clean,u can see it. we order the shirmp dumpling and pork. defnily come again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy eggplant. I can't taste anything and it's soaked in oil. Would not order this again."}
{"text":"I can't help it, but I consider dumplings to be street food, and I have a tough time paying $10 for 10 dumplings.    The dumplings were fine, although nothing special.  They just weren't super juicy or flavorful.  I kind of equate this to paying $10 for an ok hotdog.  Unless the dog was kicked up several notches, I've basically paid $2 for a decent street dog all my life.  I'm also used to getting my dumplings in New York for a buck for five.  And these are enormous yummy pot stickers.  And forget about what I got while travelling through China (though you do wonder what's in them)  So this place is fine... it's ok. I'm glad to have one in this neck of the woods.. but what it really shows is we need a good dumpling truck downtown."}
{"text":"Our favorite go to place! Everything is so tasty! Pork and chive dumplings, beef noodle soup, Bao, are absolutely delicious! Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for beef noodle soup especially during our cold winter.  I was expecting it to look like Food Ninja N.'s photo of the beef being brown.  Instead, I received beef that was pink/red that looked undercooked (raw?).  I asked them why it was this colour and was told it was the soup's broth... umm no.    First off, I'm Chinese (banana) but have eaten a lot of Asian food around the world especially in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.    The broth if you want to call it that tasted like salty-sour (rancid?) and the noodles was not Shanghai noodles!  Instead they were the pre-package bland udon you can get at Chinese grocery stores.  I just ate the noodles and didn't eating the red beef or broth.  I am hoping I do not get food poisoned by this place.  Price: $9.99 * 13% tax = $11.29 (he put in $11.30 in the debit machine, was not happy and was very tempted to not leave a tip...).  I'm not being cheap, if he had put in the exact amount, I would have left a typical 10% on top of the tax.  I should have listened to my instincts especially how during lunch time on a weekday the place was empty, there is a reason.    Taste: 1/5 Freshness: 1/5 Presentation: 3/5 - looked pretty but not really, I'm used to Chinese food lacking in presentation plating if the food was good Atmosphere: looks clean but nothing was really fancy-looking.  Overall, I will most definitely not be returning to this place.  I honestly feel bad for the people who wrote positive reviews of this place.  I am surprised this place has been in business for so long.  I would consider this place an embarrassment to all mainland style cooking.    If you are ever in the mood of good beef noodle soup, I would recommend Ding Tai Fung in Markham's First Markham Place.  That place is consistently good and no scary pink/red beef surprise."}
{"text":"I walk by this place many times finally decided to give it a try.  I have to say the prices were a bit pricy compared to other dumpling places I have been to. The food was okay. Although I have to say their dumplings were on the smaller size and the filling was just too salty.  The service was okay. Overall, this place is okay but I have been to better dumpling places."}
{"text":"Don't just order anything. Must order - pickled vegetable fish soup, pork ribs, double-cooked pork. Flavourful, worth the money. To be honest, my four stars were given for the three dishes, location and space."}
{"text":"I was passing by my old stomping grounds at Atrium on Bay, and was meeting up with a former coworker for lunch. This place used to be a sushi restaurant that would make my hair smell like oil.  I was looking through the Yelp reviews while walking towards my friend's workplace, and saw that there were some pretty positive reviews, so I decided to go check it out with her. She had the zucchini and egg dumplings, and I had the pork and chive ones. They give you 10 dumplings (boiled, steamed, or pan-fried), with a hot and sour soup, and some seaweed as an appetizer. Afterward, they give you some fruit as well. All of this for $10. I was definitely really really really full afterward, and it was just a great feeling. It was much better than walking all the way to Mother's Dumplings (which I've had bad service/experiences there for the last many times I've went).  I would have to say - this is a little gem in the Dundas & Bay area. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Restaurant had a very small dining area.  The dumplings were decent, but the prices were a bit expensive in comparison to other dumpling places."}
{"text":"cute place, it's small but it has a homely feel kinda like restos back in china! it also looks pretty clean.  I came with a friend and we ordered the steamed pork+chive dumplings, cold bean noodle salad, and hot n sour soup. i noticed other yelpers saying they got sides and fruits, but we didn't get any of these things served to us :(  the dumplings were tasty, i like the thickness of the dough. the soup was a pretty big serving for the price ($2) but unfortunately they weren't the greatest. I felt like I was drinking a big bowl of gravy syrup with some bamboo shoots. I left most of the soup untouched. The cold bean salad, I've had a lot better, but I've also had worse. I'd say it tasted better than the ones I've had at T&T, but that's not saying much.    despite all the negatives, I've generally had a pleasant experience, so I would definitely come back! I'm glad to see this place among so many soulless chain restos in the area, so I hope it will thrive in the future."}
{"text":"I feel a bit bad writing a subpar review because I have a feeling it's a family business.. but still.. truth must be told!! Living nearby, I've been meaning to try this place. Love dumplings. They were just about closing so we ordered take out - pan fried pork and chive dumplings and ma pao tofu and rice.  Dumplings - flavour was delicious, filling to dough ratio good, but the problem was the sheer amount of oil used. It was dripping with oil.. I couldn't get through half of them before starting to feel queasy lol. Ma Pao Tofu - tasted horrible. The oily sauce in it was really really bad compared to so many other ones.. tasted like rotten medicine.. weird.. maybe a super preserved secret oil or something.  Rice - $1.50 extra. Rice was hard, not moist like it should be.. probably got the bottom of the batch cuz it was the end of the night."}
{"text":"Favorite dumpling place outside of Chinatown!!! Always reliable, fast and friendly service. Very reasonably priced. We always get the pork and chive dumplings -- truly authentic and homemade. Overall a must try for dumplings!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here because it was close to the bus stop. The place is small but clean. They have cute pictures drawn by children posted on their counter. Their menu is pretty straightforward. Basically what type of dumplings you want. It is a bit pricey here, but it may be due to the fact that they make their dumplings fresh. We waited for a bit before we got our dumplings. We heard pounding, and we assumed that they were making the dumplings right then and there. When we got the dumplings, they were big and juicy. Their dumpling sauce is yummy as well. Oh yeah...soup or salad comes with the meal. We picked the soup, and we didn't drink it. A small fruit salad came after the meal, which was refreshing. Delicious place and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Got delivery through Order It, I ordered pan fried shrimp and pork dumplings, and a lotus roots salad. The dumplings came in a plastic container, but the lotus salad came in a small styrofoam box, when the food arrived the box was open and most of the sauce spilled into the bag. The lotus roots salad ($6.99) is slices of cooked lotus roots soaked in soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger slices and a dozen hot peppers.  This dish is very salty because they used too much soy sauce.  I used the extra sauce to dip the dumplings afterward.  There were 15 pieces of pan fried shrimp and pork dumplings ($10.59) in one order.  Some of them were a bit burnt on the outside, the dumpling wrappers were thicker than average, and the ratio of the dough was more than the meat.  The taste by itself was blend, didn't taste like they marinaded or seasoned the meat before wrapping. This meal left me feeling disappointed and very thirsty."}
{"text":"I almost cried after eating dumplings here.   The dumplings tasted like paper-mache, rolled in vegetables that are over-seasoned.  The paste was extremely thick and the sauce way too strong. As soon as I swallowed it I could feel my stomach protest.   We also ordered beef noodle soup, which turned out (not surprisingly) atrocious.  The whole soup was gooey with oil. To top that off, the beef was so tough that it was hard to chew.   Avoid this place like the plague if you don't want your palate to be burnt off."}
{"text":"I rarely take location into account when drafting my Yelp reviews. Good for is worth a bit of a trek.  But location is a key selling point for Beijing Dumplings (BD), an otherwise mediocre dumpling joint that just happens to straddle the Dim Sum Black Hole that is the Bay-Yonge corridor.   Sure, there are a few fast food joints along the way, and a trip just a bit west along Dundas yields plenty of Chinese Food finds. But sometimes I'm caught just North of the Eaton Centre on business, and need to get my dumpling on. On these occasions, I'm glad BD is there for me.   Service is pleasant and welcoming. On entry I'm waved to the closest empty booth, and  presented with a glass of fragrant green tea. Servers hover unobtrusively; generally leaving me alone unless I get their attention (which is a good thing over a working lunch).   I order pan fried pork dumplings and, since I'm fighting a cold, a hot and sour soup.   The soup runs less than two bucks, but even at that price it's a disappointment. Slightly sour, it needs an infusion of soy sauce for flavour and in a first (for me, anyway), a few spoons of chills in oil to reach something approaching \"hot\".   I wait, and wait, and wait for dumplings. I'd be annoyed, but I've got a bit of time, and I'm grateful for the quiet.   Dumplings eventually arrive. One bite, and I think \"aha, so this is where the lost salt from my soup went). Soy sauce, they don't need-but writing them off for saltiness would be unfair. These dumplings have excellent porky flavour, tender greenery and delightfully crisped, chewy wrappers. I have to pact myself lest I inhale the whole dozen. Instead it takes me a few breaths.   I might consider adding a star, but for two concerns: 1) the bathrooms are filthy filthy dirty, and 2) maybe it's because I was seated in front of the open kitchen, but DAMN this place is hot. The food wasn't anywhere close to fiery, but I left drenched in sweat. Not the best way to go back to work.   Are these the best dumplings in Toronto? Nope. But if you can't be with the dumplings you love, love the dumplings you're with."}
{"text":"Best dumplings I've eaten in Toronto - and I've eaten a lot of dumplings in my life around the world! The other menu items are okay, but the real winners are the dumplings. Stick to these (especially the pork / prawn or pork/prawn ones) and you won't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Terrible value and poor attempt at authentic northern Chinese food.   Will update with better review. Felt compelled to warn first."}
