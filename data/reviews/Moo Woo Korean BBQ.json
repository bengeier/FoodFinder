{"text":"Delicious food. Great customer service. Clean bathroom. Got the Moo Woo combo, about $53 but comes with Rib Eye. All other cuts of meat were also awesome. Host cooked the meat right in front of us, and right to our requested temp. Great experience and even better representation of Korean BBQ. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"So nice to have KBBQ on this side of town! The Woo combo was delicious and fairly priced and the service was wonderful. Will definitely go back, such a great meal. Thanks Moo Woo :)) Maybe the North West is finally getting better."}
{"text":"Our first family dinner here, and definitely not our last! The food was great and plentiful! Our experience overall was top notch. The owner took very good care of us, and her wait staff was attentive. But the meat... mmmmmmm mmmmm! Flavorful, perfectly marbled and tender beyond belief... perfectly accompanied by the sides. The price was just perfect and a great deal for a hearty and fun meal. My family and I give it a high recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out and it was delicious! We don't have to travel to Chinatown to get our KBBQ fix. It's a simple place with all the good food. We had the Moo Woo Combo for two of us. It was plenty. They picked a good combination to fill our stomachs- rib eye steak, beef brisket, pork shoulder, pork belly, and sweet chicken with many sides such as kimchi soup, salad, and egg soup. In addition, the Cass Korean beer is only $8 and the staff is superb and friendly! We will definitely return again soon."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean restaurant in north Las Vegas, the LA Galbi is honestly better quality than most places in Chinatown"}
{"text":"Finally! A Korean BBQ place in North Las Vegas! Awesome food and awesome service! No more driving to the strip for BBQ! Must try and experience yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I visited a few months back and my server, Mackenzie Bouddhara, was AMAZING. He explained the choices on the menu, recommended customers favorite, catered to my table frequently with friendly service and upbeat personality, and even helped us cook our food.  The place is conveniently on my side of town. The food was so delicious and my service was beyond fantastic. The only problem is that it is not all you can eat and it is very pricey. I definitely recommend for a special occasion though!"}
{"text":"We sat the middle of the crowded tables, they brought us a bowl of soup without any smaller bowls that we can share, but other customers got it just besides us. let's see others. Slow service, we had to pick the meat up by ourselves cuz the meat was almost burnt while she came over.It didn't bother me to continue to eat without any sauce, or dipping plate even though I saw other customers got those too. The point is I got SICK after dinning there, not only is my illness, but also my heart. You guys truly let our good feeling about Korean barbecue gone from now on."}
{"text":"More formal than the Korean BBQ that I had in Tokyo where it was a chain like Denny's.   The service was great, the food was great, and the price was not too bad.  My son and I had a great meal and interacted with someone who said he was the dishwasher, but I think he was also an owner because he really wanted us to understand the meal and enjoy it.  I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, restaurant is clean and meats are delicious. It's nice to have a Kbbq spot here in the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Best Korean barbecue in this side of town. The staffs are friendly and helpful. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying Yum!  It's my first time in and it's a good experience. The venue is very chill and relaxed. The food is excellent. The ambiance is nice and I love their playlist. Come get some great eats and give yourself some chill time. I'm seriously contemplating the mochi too! Ps. Prime beef bulgogi is a Yes Please!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing from the high quality meats to the kimchee soup.  It was the perfect amount of food!   We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hidden treasure. Korean bbq was very good! Will come back with my family. Andy was a great server and cook."}
{"text":"Drove across town when I found out this place opened.  Well worth the trip.  Condiments that came before dinner were ALL good.  Then an amazing dinner. Best place in town.  HINT: Dip the meat in the salt,then marinade.  Amazing !"}
{"text":"I'm very big on customer service and this place had bad customer service. It was my first time there and explain some but not a lot of what I needed to do. I didn't you they cook because I wanted to cook it how I liked it. Food was good but will not being coming back."}
{"text":"Finally! A Korean BBQ place in our area! Went here with my fam & tried the 'woo BBQ combo'. Different slices of beef were served but liked mostly the marinated ones. The sides are all good but served only in little amount (would love to have a little more). Love the tofu stew that came with it. Also, the staff were all so friendly and attentive. All in all, I will be coming back to try their other Korean dishes!"}
{"text":"Such a good place to eat, food is great and great place for family or friends to get together. Prices are a little up there but is worth it and logical everyone should try this place!"}
{"text":"I have been to Moo Woo twice and have been fully satisfied both times!!! The service was on point and the food was very tasty. We had the Woo platter both times and added an orderof shrimp to compliment the meal. Both times we went with three adults and it was more than enough meat. My only compliant is that I wish there was more of the cheese corn that came with the meal. Moo Woo is modern, clean and a welcome addition to this side of town!!! Also they offer a military discount if you ask the server/waiter about it. ;-)    Next time we go, we will try something different."}
{"text":"Not a bad Korean BBQ restaurant. Had the Moo combo and it was okay especially the pork belly. A little bit hard to understand what the servers were trying to say but the service wasn't bad. Overall a-ok dining experience."}
{"text":"I recently just discovered this place a few weeks ago and I love it! After the KBBQ we used to always go to got dirty dining, we have been trying to find a new place. Luckily, we found this one and even though I've only been here twice, the food is always delicious and the staff is very friendly. After we made reservations and arrived there, our table was already prepared and our waiter ordered drinks right away. They also cook your food mostly for you. I have had no problems whatsoever and highly recommend this place. The restaurant itself is well presented, clean, and modern. Absolutely will come back"}
{"text":"So awesome and convenient for the northwest area!!! Customer service is superb and it does get busy on the weekends. Meat selection combos are a good fit for the price. I usually do ayce and I'm surprised i got full here. They don't have ayce here btw but still worth it."}
{"text":"This is the third time that I visited Moo Woo Korean BBQ, each time with different folks because the food was simply delicious! My guest left extremely satisfied and happy. They want to return before returning home."}
{"text":"Delicious bbq. The beef tasted clean and rich. The side dishes were great accompaniments to the meal. Our servers were attentive, funny, and knowledgeable. Even the owner came over to say hi. Will be back when in Vegas..."}
{"text":"I am a Korean food snob as I lived in Korea in my youth as Marine in the 1980s. This restaurant is by far the best quality and authentic Korean BBQ restaurant I have visited in the United States. The service was great and very attentive. I'm now a regular after only one visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Would definitely recommend for anyone interested in trying Korean BBQ!! New favorite place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!! I visited my friend around this neighborhood and she told me that there is a new korean bbq place. First, name of the restaurant was so cute. Secondly, the the free side dishes were so good!!! I had to refill couple of times. it's a must!!! the quality of the meat is wordlessly high. Love all the workers there as well. Very friendly and so kind enough to give instructions how to eat and use chopsticks! :) Thank you and I will definitely come back when I visit again. Try corn cheese!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Food was amazing and authentic! The owners and staff are very friendly! We will be going back as much as we can! I would recommend this place to friends and family!"}
{"text":"My husband and I haven't gone out for Korean BBQ in a long time, and boy this place did not disappoint!! Our waiter was awesome and the food was delicious, of course. So good, that we ordered a second round of banchan and will be taking a nice fat box of leftovers home! Great atmosphere and super duper friendly staff. We'll be revisiting soon, and often! Thanks Moo Woo!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out, and finally did! My family and I got the Woo Combo for 2-3 people, which had different types of beef. The meats were tender, I especially liked the bulgogi. The combo included side dishes, steamed egg, soup, house salad, corn w/ cheese. The steamed egg was pretty good, but the bean paste stew was kind of bland. Also, the size of the soup for 2-3 people was kind of small. We also ordered Jap Chae, which was alright, it needed more flavor in my opinion. Other than that, the service was really good. Everyone had positive attitudes. Definitely giving this place another try!"}
{"text":"Our ribeye was very tender and delicious.  They were grilling our meat and  were very attentive to our needs.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Family run spot that is on par with the K-Town spots in Los Angeles were are hard to compete with.  Amazingly impressed.  Its kind of pricey though for this part of town.  But the quality is there."}
{"text":"My first Korean BBQ experience and I will be back. The selection of meat was good and the marinades superb. So many different flavors and textures that all went so well together. The portions are quite large and my wife and I struggled to eat all that was put before us. The entire wait staff was very friendly and attentive. We were never in need of a refill, and we drink our sodas fast. We got the woo combo which was mainly beef."}
{"text":"My family and I came here last night for dinner after a day of shooting. We were out all day so we really worked up an appetite. We had the Moo Woo Combo since there was 7 of us. Their quality of meat was a Grade A. It's a little bit different from other Korean BBQ were used to in LA because it goes by combos and the waiters cook for you. We're used to AYCE. All the bachan and rice is AYCE though. The owners Jennifer and Ricky really gave us excellent hospitality. Raphael was our waiter for the night and he was very attentive to our needs along with Mac when Raphael was busy. Quality and Quantity A+"}
{"text":"Usually I love All you Can Eat (AYCE) Korean cause it can get pretty pricey.  But pleasantly surprised that there was so much food that came with the group selection in the menu.  Paid what we would usually pay at an AYCE Korean place and left full and happy.  Food tasted great and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food for the price! Awesome customer service from the staff especially with Raphael!!! Me and my boyfriend always go here when we crave some Korean BBQ. Thanks for the great service once again! Definitely our go to place!"}
{"text":"So gross!  They cut raw chicken with scissors and then turned around and used the same scissors to cut our fully cooked pork. Felt totally rushed because someone stood at our table cooking our food, one entree after another. Isn't the point to cook your own, at your own pace and enjoy the meal?  Was no nicer than the nearby fast food establishments, but cost well over $150 for 4 people. Definitely wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"First time eating Korean BBQ and I was truly impressed. The quality of the beef was outstanding. Certainly enough food for 2 people !! My husband and I ordered the Woo Combo and highly recommend this selection. We'll definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"We are really happy to see more diversity of restaurants in this area. Loved the Korean bbq concept. For a family of 4, we chose the 3-4 Moo combo. This included a delicious assortment of meats with condiments. It was the perfect amount of food for hearty appetites.   The soup that came with it was too spicy for my liking or the kids.  The service was spotty since it seems they don't have one server per table but rather a team approach. This left us waiting for items and help several times throughout the visit. Also encountered some new employees who couldn't seem to answer menu questions well.   All in all, we had a good time, food was delicious and it was something different than the usual chains that are in this part of town. We will be back."}
{"text":"Its o......k......not a very good selection of items.  Service is also ooo......kkkkk.....NOT very friendly people.  Price is well above better Korean BBQ places around town.  But glad to have them in Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"Food is bomb. Ordered the moo woo combination special. The quality and service is great. The quality of the food is certainly different from other KBBQ restaurants - in a good way. They also cook it for you. The spicy chicken is bomb.  So is the Kalbi. We moved far from here so I probably won't be coming back much but I'll definitely go when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This is a great Korean BBQ restaurant. Food is tasty, fresh and plentiful. The service is attentive and courteous. We always get the kalbi and the fish."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, service is exceptional! So happy they are in the North. I dont have to drive far to get my Korean BBQ fix now!!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for lunch. We ordered the moo woo BBQ combo plus a bibimbop.  It was so much delicious food for the four of us. We some how managed to finish all the meat and the bibimbop.  I will definitely be bringing more friends here next time we have Korean BBQ.  The gentleman who cook the food has an amazing personality and was very friendly and entertaining.     If you don't want to drive all the way to China town, COME HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Got a chance to go here pre-grand opening.  Food was amazing!  This is the \"grill at your table style\" of Korean restaurant. The beef, rib eye steak, and pork belly were delicious. All the side dishes (banchan) were excellent.  They have kind of a tempura zucchini with a red sauce on it that really stood out to me.  Everything was excellent!  I hope they have a long and successful business."}
{"text":"Delicious and great service with Chang!! We had the moo woo combo and not disappointed.  Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about eating Korean BBQ but really enjoyed the food and experience. I even learned how to use chopsticks"}
{"text":"Food is very consistent here. Had the LA Galbi again and it was really good. Place is clean and service was great. Brand new place. Decor and ambiance fits with the theme."}
{"text":"This place is so cute, and perfect for little date with your boo, or even a night out with some friends. I went here with a group for homecoming, and everyone was satisfied with their meal. The server was super sweet, and not once seemed bothered when we asked for extra services. Super chill place, and I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Service is spot on, great sauce, priced fairly. The short rib game is A+. We came to celebrate a birthday and the service is paced slow enough to enjoy the experience and the company."}
{"text":"Been here a few times as a local centennial hills resident. It was always a trip downtown to get decent Korean bbq, but now we don't have to take a 30 min drive for authentic Korean food. The menu is robust and the quality is great. The servers are responsive and respectful. I can't believe how expensive Korean food has become the last few years, and this is no exception. However, if you're looking for a great Korean spot, this is as good as it gets in NW Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service!! Some of the reviews are saying the prices are high, but they are comparable to every other Korean BBQ in town!! Nothing outrageous! Combo meal is the way to go! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Solid Korean BBQ. Their entrees were great and I liked all of the side dishes, in particular the kimchi."}
{"text":"This place has the worst lines, rude ass servers and the meat is super low quality. Trying to pass off some chinese gmo plastic rice feed beef as quality???  I obviously can just go to chinatown if i wanted that low quality rude service!  I would def not spend you hard earned moneys here.  Unethically run business.  Stay away."}
{"text":"This is a really good Korean resturant. The food is cooked at your table in front of you."}
{"text":"This is the korean bbq with the best service and high quality food. Our server rafael was very helpful and nice and took care of everything for us. I just moved to this area and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE   The customer service is amazing. And the employees and atmosphere is crazy amazing ! Definitely recommend to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for lunch yesterday with some co-workers and was pleasantly surprised. Welcoming and comfortable layout and the cuts if meat we're tasty. Prices were fair and the staff was more than welcoming, I'll definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"This is my first time with my coworkers and the foods excellent. My coworkers had Moo Woo combo they really liked it"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Came here based on yelp reviews and not disappointed. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The staff is great, it is clean, bright, and spacious inside. We did the Moo Combo for two and we were very pleased! The Moo Combo came with pork belly, pork shoulder, and pork skirt, then came the chicken and lastly the squid. The meats were seasoned well and so delicious right off the grill! The side dishes were also fresh and amazing! Make sure you come hungry or you might not finish it all. Everything was just great! Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"This a clean, casual environment with great service!  Awesome food with great flavor profiles.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ever since they posted the \"coming soon\" banners, I've been excited to try Moo Woo.  But now that I've tried them, it's going to be my one and only visit.  I think I'll take a little extra time to drive over to the Spring Mountain area or other locations where the Korean BBQ restaurants are a little more seasoned in impressing and retaining their guests.  My trial was during a quiet lunchtime.  It took a while for someone to notice me and then, even though I said it was \"just me\", they still sat me at a huge BBQ grill table.  There were other smaller tables available nearby.  They were gracious about redeeming their Yelp offer--either a wet towel pack or facial.  And, they brought a nice amount of banchan, with fresh types of kimchi.  The lunch menu isn't huge, but there is good variety. I ordered the Galbitrang ($13) the short rib soup which had an adequate amount of boneless short ribs and a modest amount of noodles  The broth was nondescript--mild with salty undertones--which I had to amp up with some kimchi. I wasn't expecting a rich simmered ramen broth, but had hoped for something with more umami.  Service was forgettable.  Maybe they do a better job with the actual Korean BBQ grills in the evenings, but I would hope that any restaurant would set higher service standards no matter the time of day or size of the group.  I had such hopes for experiencing this place, especially since this area of the valley can use more diversity.  Unfortunately, Moo Woo turned out to be fairly average, especially compared to what you can get if you're willing to take a short drive elsewhere."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't already left a review for this place. I've already been here 3 times! The consistency of customer service is incredible. They're always so quick, fast, and tend to every need. The food is great... the \"Woo Combo\" is what we always get. The kimchi soup was good but I think the tofu soup is even better! The quality of the meat is great. I don't think it's pricy at all. You get what you pay for! This place is a great environment, great food, and great service."}
{"text":"My favorite!!! #1 Korean Food in Hawaii hands down!!! Followed this place from Hawaii Kai, to Windward Mall now on King Street! Thank you Aunty Kris for making the onoest Korean food ever!!! Highly recommended for all you Korean Food lovers"}
{"text":"First time going with my husband and 3 kiddos. Food was more than expected, it was really good. Owner was really friendly. I would defend recommended to anyone"}
{"text":"Everyone was friendly the lady working there helped us cook our meat. Place was very clean but it's a little pricey for me but the meat was delicious and you get what you pay for I just wish it was all you can eat"}
{"text":"Good kbbq on the north west!  Unfortunately not AYCE but the meat & price is still worth it. Love coming here with my family. They cook the meat for you, which isn't a big deal because we're used to cooking it ourselves, but it's nice anyways and the servers are very attentive.   Try the seafood pancake! Super yummy & definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great quality meat! We did the Woo Combo for 2-3 and it was VERY FILLING! Staff is very friendly and they even will cook the meat for you so that it's perfect. Combo came with a lot of extras and lots of sides.   If you are looking for ALL YOU CAN EAT this place IS NOT AYCE!  However, you will be just as FULL as if you were eating AYCE!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here. Great food and excellent service. Brought my coworkers and we will all be coming back."}
{"text":"Once again, We have landed back at MooWoo's and decided to try new items,  Personally I am extremely picky about the way my bibim bap is made, (spice, proportion:price, flavors and presentation) It has exceeded all my expectations.  Reasons for five stars: - Excellent service, not only to our table but to others as well - Price, seems a little too much but sides were limitless, and portions per serving were generous, even if they were to cut down it would still be worth it. - Quality is exceptional, bright red meats no sign of freezer burn or marks. -Atmosphere is moderate, nothing to flashy, but the place is clean and well kept.  -Service time on a slow day is great, as per a busy day as well. Its understable to have  slower service on a busy day especially at Korean Bbqs, I am most impressed that they handled all the tables with only 3 people on the floor.  All in all, If I am ever in the area, this will be my go to, as well as if friends or family need recommendations. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Man I love this spot!! Finally I get my Korean BBQ fix and I don't have to leave Centennial.  This is my third time being here and eaCH time the meat and Kim chi has been great.  That's a huge compliment.    Great new clean place!  5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING ! Such a nice group of workers ! Delicious food ! The entire table is filled with food so it is definitely worth the price ! For $60 we could easily feed 4 people ! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND !!!"}
{"text":"Jennifer and Ricky were wonderful and so inviting! They made our entire experience amazing! The food was really great and the restaurant is unique. I would come back just for Jennifer and Ricky. We love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open. Thank the good Lord that we finally have Korean in the nw! I get my Korean fix now. Hubby and I came here twice already. Place is very clean. The owners are super nice! First time we ordered hot stone bowl and a stew and everything was so yummy. Next time we brought a meeting to the restaurant and the owners were so accommodating. The waiters come with large waters, sides, and just get the party started! I love the fact that when we ordered bulgogi (really good marination, not overly sweet like some places, and very tender) the smoke did not get all up in my face. And thank you for the huge tables!!!! All the Korean restaurants always seem to cram a whole bunch of stuff on the tables, but this place has huge tables!!!! The stews are great, meats are great, it's NOT ayce but it's QUALITY! TRUST ME, I'M KOREAN. So so so so so happy these guys are here. I'm pretty sure this will be our weekly spot that we hit. This place gives me the feels. Come eat here. You won't regret. And if you don't think so, stop being petty."}
{"text":"It was very tasty. The service was good and they cook the food for you. A warm and inviting place for a family or a date. The staff is kind and attentive."}
{"text":"It was our 2nd time coming here and we always enjoy our food. Last time was January for my son 22nd Birthday. Everyone was so nice. My son was busy working live during our dinner and I was busy with my 10 months old daughter. The guy serving us prepared all our food and cut the meat in small pieces. We forgot to bring my son's cake so instead they made him a little something."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and great food! Very happy the owner decided to open shop in the NW valley. Now we don't have to do downtown for quality Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Excellent service and love finally having a Korean restaurant in the northwest. Additionally, being able to cook at the table bravo. Nice to have meals priced for individuals and groups."}
{"text":"Dear Scott L, the only way we would come back is if you have more efficient service. And if it was on the house!"}
{"text":"So fun and exciting this side of town offers Korean bbq! Got the Woo combo which was just enough to feed the 3 of us because of all the awesome sides! A really fantastic place to socialize and share a great meal. The only thing missing was the meat started to burn a lot because the server disappeared a few times and when we would attempt turning it ourselves he'd come out of nowhere and snatch the tongs out of our hand. Still a great experience!"}
{"text":"I have been to many places around the United States and I have to say this is by far THE BEST KOREAN BBQ spot that I have ever eaten. The meat is tender and juicy and the staff is amazing. I will most definitely be a regular at this place. Quality food and quality treatment, you cannot ask for anything more. The owner was even generous enough to personally wish my boyfriend a happy birthday. This place is so special."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We did the Moo Combo, split the 3-4 size between 4 women and we couldn't finish everything. It was so much food. Service was great too. Enjoyed this new experience."}
{"text":"This place is very nice, classy and clean plus they have a very good mix of music. The food is amazing!!! The combo menu is the best because it's extremely filling for the price. I exercise 5 days a week and I came with my girl and we got the two person Woo Combo ($56) and I was so full when we finished. The service was very good also, great place overall."}
{"text":"Awesome service, nice and clean atmosphere, delicious food cooked right in front of you, very filling! What more can you ask for? We got a Woo combo for 3-4 people. They give you lots of meats and a big variety of sides. We rarely eat Korean food so it was interesting. The kimchi was on point.  Everything was tasty. Being a family of six, we were nervous at first because we thought the first serving of meat was all we were getting but then they served us three more different meats. Everyone was satisfied. The peach soju was a plus. We didn't drink much because we were both driving but we got to take it home! The staff was very friendly from the moment we walked in to the minute we walked out. Thank you Moo Woo Korean BBQ! We are very satisfied customers and would definitely come back again! :D"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money!!! Not authentic and bland! Mondu was alright. Kimchi and bean sprout was alright. Not enough ventilation."}
{"text":"The bulgogi is bomb. The mochi balls are delicious. It seemed a little expensive for what you get but it was a great experience and service."}
{"text":"Hhhhh. I hardly review any restaurants but the end of my experience here with my wife was so bad that I had too. When we walked in we weren't greeted, we were approached with a \"follow me\" and then got sat down and handed menus with no pleasantries exchanged. Our server was fine in the beginning and helped us with our food and told us when our food was done and when we could eat it. ( I have been to Japanese BBQ places where you cook it yourself but here they do it for you... I guess??) then our last entree was put on the grill and we waited for her return to flip it or for her to tell us it was done.... but I think she forgot about us. So our chicken just crisped up and got hard on the grill while we waited for her to come back. When she finally did she said \" how is everything\" and I replied \" good, but we weren't sure if this chicken was done and we waited for you to come back and flip it\" she just nodded and smiled and walked off. I understand the language barriers but it shouldn't be  used as an excuse for poor"}
{"text":"Delicious! ! This place is the best! They give you a lot of food ! Great service there was always a server around! They help each other! Would recommend this place if you're hungry"}
{"text":"Best rib-eye I've had in Las Vegas! Amazing service, Scott is great at communicating with customers and genuinely cares about this restaurant. Wish I could give 6 stars."}
{"text":"For not being all you can eat, the combos were fulfilling most definitely! And at great prices! The food was great and the service was amazing! I can not exclaim the service part anymore, because it was such wonderful, attentive service that was provided."}
{"text":"The decor is funky and continues evenly throughout the establishment. It's definitely a good place to eat with large groups from friends to family. The service was excellent, everyone helped out especially when it became really busy. We ordered one of the entrees to feed 2-3 people, and it was more than enough food as well as decently priced.  There were only 2 things I didn't care for which is the reason for one star off. When we arrived the establishment just opened, there were 2 other couples seated in the front and we were given a table at the very back next to the doorbell and soda fountains. Anytime someone walked in the bell would go off, and it was literally right next to our heads. There should probably be a better place for that doorbell. The other problem was that red wine (merlot, cab, and Pinot) were all refrigerated. The staff has mentioned to the owner that it shouldn't be, but he insists it should. Definitely listen to the staff owner person. Other than those 2 things the place was great."}
{"text":"I mentioned this in another review but as it applies here I must mention it again... I love that a wider variety of restaurants are opening up in North Las Vegas and Moo Woo is a great alternative to driving down to Spring Mountain!   I visited on a Thursday evening and much to my delight, there was a good amount of patrons but I was able to be immediately seated. I arrived earlier than my friend and it was nice to not be badgered by the staff to order nor did I feel forgotten about.   Once my friend arrived we ordered the Woo combo and a peach Soju and everything was wonderful. My biggest pet peeve about Kbbq places that cook for you is their cooking pace. Some places take forever to cook the different meats but Moo Woo didn't seem to drag by, everything was cooked in a timely manner to where I didn't get full fast or get bored.  Looking forward to returning to try the lunch and a la carte menu!"}
{"text":"Horrible!! We paid 60 dollars for  fatty meat!! Service was bad. No sauces. Never again. I feel cheated!!!"}
{"text":"This was a great find for dinner. Having a nice kbbq place in centennial is definitely awesome. The food was amazing. The Bulgogi was tasty and the salad was super fresh. The staff was really friendly. It's not ayce but the amount of food we got was just right and the side dishes were tasty. I normally would pay a picture but we were hungry and the food that good. I definitely recommend this place. It's clean spacious not hot like some others I've been to. I can definitely say well be back"}
{"text":"This is now our favorite Korean BBQ, period. Service, quality of the food, modern decor, and friendliness are all 5 stars. Some say the price is high, but NOT so. We ate our silly heads off. Our server cooked our food for us. She knew that there is a specific order to cook the food as well as the perfect doneness. We got the 2 to 3 people combo and it was so much food. We brought our leftovers home. GREAT food!! We will be back many times."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this place. It was kind've on the pricey side and it's not all you can eat like some Korean BBQ spots I've been to. The service was great but food was just ok. The pork had a rank like taste. I was really excited to see a spot like this on my side of town but I know I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great Korean bbq for the NW. Definitely a must try.. awesome service and ribs are top notch... we will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and a great staff.  Will definately be coming back.  The owner was out and about talking to everybody.  Very friendly and damn delicious."}
{"text":"VERY RUDE!!! VERY RUDE!!! VERY RUDEl!!!  #Moo Woo Korean BBQ Las Vegas. We were seated at a table, they served kimchi and already ordered our drinks. We're asked to move to another table while we were about to order. The table was the same size, and it was just at the end of that row of tables. They have a lot of unoccupied tables in the middle section and on the other side of the wall. There was only one family aside from us who was seated down. We were dressed decent coz we came from work. So why so rude to ask your customer to give up a table for another customer who made a request to be seated particularly that  table?  This made me think that Moo Woo discriminates. We're the only Asian-Americans there. We walked out.  This is so dirty. I summed up our first experience as Very Dirty, Dirty Dining!!!  NO STAR...NO STAR. NO STAR"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday and it was an amazing experience. The staff were really great at explaining what everything was and how we should pair the different meats with the sauces. The amount of food we were served was insane in a good way. Everything was cooked to perfection and they even sang happy birthday to me and gave me a very delicious dessert."}
{"text":"This is a nice place. They do not have AYCE but they do have combos you can order instead. The menu was not explained to us when we got in but it's okay. Most of the employees don't speak English but they are all friendly! The price is kinda high if you are used to going down to Chinatown to eat AYCE. We got two meats and an app but we were still hungry. The portions were not huge. We then had to order more meat. Overall it was a good experience since we love trying new places. They actually cook the meat for you which kinda takes out the fun of Korean BBQ.  Overall for $100 it's an okay place. For half that price you can go down to Chinatown and AYCE, but the experience is what will bring you back to this place. Beautiful, clean, and friendly."}
{"text":"Nice, casual setting. Friendly staff. We had 10 people in our party and they accommodated us quickly. This place is better than the other Korean BBQ joint we went to. The staff attended to us well and cooked our food for us! Great service and we will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I've had this spot on my list for almost a year and I was looking forward to enjoying a meal here. This location had 4 1/2 stars so I was pretty excited to see what ass the fuss was about. I'll be honest with you guys, I was pretty disappointed.   We walked in, the dining area smelt great, and they sat us quickly. The menu was simple but I personally thought pricing was to high.   I posted a picture to my Instagram stories and this was the text I sent a girlfriend who asked what I thought:    It looked good but it smelled even better. Sadly the pork burned while we waited for our cook. We also weren't sure if we were supposed to serve ourselfs or wait for someone to plate it for us. Another disappoint ment was the pork tasted like it had soaked in Mexican chill spices for days. It was just way way too much.   And the beef was just OK. Not great, just ok, but I will say it was much more enjoyable than the pork. I have a hole in the wall place here in Las Vegas I love. It is hands down the best damn Korean BBQ I've ever had and it's $15 to feed 3 people. It's an hour round trip to eat there so I was hoping to find something close to home but no such luck yet. Tonight we spent $50 for two meats, didn't eat the pork because it was not enjoyable, didn't get any rice with the meal, and they forgot my pot stickers lol I was so over it and ready to leave. Will update review if needed for next visit"}
{"text":"We tried a place closer to our house. We liked it was open later then most. The prices are great. Portions and sides are very good. Meats were very flavorful . Staff was very helpful and answered all of our questions A+ we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Awesome service and food! Loved everything I had!  def going back!!!  Started with coconut shrimp and then had plenty of meat. They cook everything right there at your table so everything is so fresh:)"}
{"text":"Food was good. The service is fast! The only reason I gave three stars is because half of the fun at a K-bbq place is cooking the food yourself. The waiter here do the cooking for you which is less fun and detracts from the experience I was expecting. If I could, I would give a 3.5 because the sides are good here."}
{"text":"Love this place - it's our go-to korean bbq place and is definitely the best in NLV! Their house marinade is so good on the beef and pork!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to try out this Korean BBQ spot that is tucked away in our neighborhood.  Great food, fast service, fair pricing, plenty of food for leftovers to make a whole other meal!  Glad to see we have this dining option that isn't on Spring Mountain!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my new favorite restaurants! The service was absolutely incredible! They had three people greet us when we came in the door. When we sat down they immediately gave us a bunch of little free appetizers while we looked at the menu. Some of the things looked expensive, so we ordered the cheaper items and found out that even the $10 plates fed all three of us! At the end we were given free spa face masks.... a little odd, but much appreciated! I would definitely recommend this place and we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Definitely will come back. Servers are all very good. Yummy foods. Rib eye \"THE BEST\""}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Ribeye was on point. Meats fresh. Soon tofu stew was delish. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The food is good and the prices high, but that's normal for Korean food. The service was a bit slow, but the restaurant is very nice overall."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my old man yesterday and I am very impressed. We got the Moo Combo which feeds 2 - 3 people. For the price of $53 it actually pretty good. Service was friendly, it wasn't busy. As for going out to eat, this place exceeded my expectations for only being open for 4 months. Only reason I give it 4 stars is that they charge $1 for refills. Will return in the future!"}
{"text":"This place is a must! The food is delicious, service is fantastic, and the portions are huge! The owner was walking around talking to costumers and was so friendly and honest--made ya feel like family. I can't wait to come back for more yummy food!! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"most of the meats were marinated with an awesome marinade. the waitresses were very nice and helpful. new cool spot, I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Moo Woo is a good choice for Korean BBQ (no AYCE here btw) but unless you live in the immediate area, there are better options in Spring Mountain. Nevertheless if you decide to go to Moo Woo then you won't be disappointed.  First off I love their current check-in deal. As of August 2017, you can receive a wet towel or facial mask. Sort of different than your plain 'ol free drink deal, isn't it? Seriously +1 for uniqueness!  The interior is clean and looks pretty cool. I like how simple the place looks without screaming kbbq too much. Moo Woo is located in a shopping district and has plenty of parking spaces as well so it's very accessible.  The meat choices are pretty pricey but delicious nonetheless. There is a variety you can choose from and the portions are decent. I'd say most of the choices were fresh and very filling. I think my favorite was the beef briskets but the marinated chicken was great as well. The banchan is good, especially the kim chee.  Overall my experience at Moo Woo was enjoyable. It's good to see a Korean BBQ joint in this part of town. I think it's a solid choice but I will say that since it's à la carte you expect high quality meats because you are paying a premium. The meat is good but I've had the same quality at even AYCE places such as Gen BBQ in Henderson. Moo Woo is faaar from where I live so I probably won't be back for a while but I'd recommend it to anyone that is around its vicinity."}
{"text":"Very clean and pleasing atmosphere. Food was decent but we've had better. Gave it 4 stars for service and ok food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Totally hit the spot for Asian BBQ. They start by bringing out a bunch of little appetizers, and the cucumbers are my favorite. The kimchi is really good too! We got the fried potstickers and corn cheese appetizers, and they were both delicious. Our dinner was the marinated prime beef, cooked on a hot grill at our table, and it smelled soooo good, and was even better when we ate it! Moo Woo is the best!"}
{"text":"Another victim of 4.5 star rated restaurant. This is literally the worst kbbq experience I've had and this restaurant can get away with it because they have no competition in this side of town.   I came here for Mother's Day with my family of 3 for the first time based on good reviews. Me and my sister ordered the moo combo to share and my mom got the bibimbap.  The moo combo said it feeds 2-3 people for 53 bucks but I'm surprised if it can even feed one person. It came with 8 thin brisket, 1 strip of pork belly and 1 strip of pork neck, 1 sirloin,  bulgogi and spicy chicken in the smallest possible portion I've ever seen.  Keep in mind these are not even quality meats either and are usually in the lunch or cheap price at ayce places.  Next is service, there were 2 guys helping us, an Asian and a white guy. I honestly think something was wrong with the white guy because all he could say is \"here's that.\" Everytime he would bring our food he would only say \"here's that.\" When they forgot our steamed egg and bulgogi for 20 minutes, and I asked about it the guy brought it out and just said \"here's that,\" and when we paid and he gave us our check back all he said was \"here's that\" and nothing else. He was obviously new because he was always asking the Asian server but they should train him to be friendly and teach him manner words like \"thank you\" and \"sorry\" before teaching him anything else.   Next is the ventilation. This place has some serious ventilation issue compared to all other kbbq places. My mom couldn't breathe halfway through the meal and had to go outside for fresh air. I also got a headache in the middle of our meal because of the terrible ventilation.  Overall, this is probably the worst kbbq place in Las Vegas. Hugely overpriced, tiny portion, horrible service,  and ventilation issues. This is the only kbbq place in this area so they know they can get away with it. For people thinking about dining here, don't make the same mistake as us and drive a little further for a better kbbq experience."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit! I live close by so I've come here two or three times. It's not all you can eat. The portions are good. I ordered the beef special. Everything tasted authentic. I think I docked one star only because the decor was minimal. I love Korean food and this is much closer than China town. It's priced average for Korean food. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Service is good, staff is nice. Had the brisket which was very fatty and the chicken is all dark meat - good if that's what you like. Would have been nice to have some white meat. Otherwise, pleasant and nice location."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we absolutely loved it! They're meats are so tender they just melt in your mouth. I would definitely come here again despite them taking a bit too long at the beginning to bring out our meats"}
{"text":"Great value, good quality meats, it's nice to have Korean BBQ in the northwest.  Only thing is they are closed on Sundays, so keep that in mind if planning to eat there. Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"I am Korean and I am so so so HAPPY that there's this Korean restaurant in Centennial Hills area. Their staffs are always fantastic and very attentive, and the food is great! My American husband loves this place too :-)"}
{"text":"The food is very good. We shared the Moo sampler which included riveted, brisket, pork belly, pork collar butt and the spicy marinated chicken. You also get 7 sides, steamed eggs, soup, cheese corn and salad. The server cooks the meat table side for you. Our server was friendly and extremely personable. He told us interesting stories and was easy to speak with. He was on top of everything and we never felt neglected or like we were being pestered. The food was flavorful and all together delicious. They offer to refill any side and provide rice if you want it. I tried the Korean raspberry wine and it is amazing. I am not generally a beer drinker but I tried the Cass that my husband ordered and I liked it. The sampler which you can get to feed 2-3 Ppl or 4-5 is more than enough food.  The wonderful thing is you can take extras home with you.  We will definitely be returning.  Thank you Moo woo for a wonderful experience and great food."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat! Such a large selection of meats when you get the Moo Woo Combo. It's amazing. The servers even come and cook the meat for you! If course, you can tell them not to and just take over. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"First off, I'm really glad I found a K-BBQ place that's not located in or near Chinatown. I came across this place by accident when my siblings and I were driving around the plaza to see what new businesses have opened up in the area.  The main thing I noticed about this place was the cleanliness and how modern it looked. Everything still looks brand new. Majority of the seating are booths, which I like, because it offers a lil bit more privacy. Plus, the coziness. lol  They do not offer All You Can Eat (AYCE), but the quality of the meat was great. No problems there. Our server did all the cooking and cutting of the meat. He made our first visit more personable by having little convos with us every time he came back to the table. The rest of the food's taste, such as the side dishes and mini appetizers, were good too.  I really like the fact that this K-BBQ is set apart from the rest. It gives options to those who live in the northwest part of town and who don't want to travel all the way down to Spring Mountain.  Despite all of the above, I gave this place 4 stars due to a few things that could use some improvement. Our server didn't come back to us after the last set of meat was cooked. Someone else took over and... well.. that was it.   Also, they were mopping and cleaning around the tables/booths right next to us while we were eating. They should worry about the side that has no customers first, before going around the entire restaurant. They close at midnight, but they already started cleaning up around 11 pm. I don't want to smell the aroma of a mop and cleaning products while I'm eating.  Other than that, we all had a great time and would come back again if we're in the area."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!  Three of us shared the large BBQ platter and everything was yummy.  One of my friends got Bi Bim Bop and she said it was authentically good having lived in Korea previously."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The service was great, the food was DELICIOUS! We got the Woo platter and omg!! There was two of us and it was a lot of food! I've been wanting to try this place since they opened and I'm so excited we were able to try it out. Growing up in a Korean household, I tend to be picky when it comes to Korean food, but I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was a great place! The Family & I enjoyed our experience! Food was great and the service was good! They were very helpful to guide us with what to pair what with! Totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Good  Food with Excellent Service. Very happy to have this addition in Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"Amazing food. We got the Woo Combo and it came with so much meat and sides were included as well like kimchi, rice, and cheesy corn (other sides were there too). The bulgogi was my favorite especially dipped in the house sauce mmmmm delicious. I also appreciated the service. The server actually cooked our meat for us which I thought was so nice. Would definitely come again :)"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in Centennial Pkwy, I am super happy that we have a Korean BBQ place here in the Northwest now! My Boyfriend and I went the last night and we had the Woo Combo. It was a nice assortment of meat, not too much and not too little. I fell in love with the fish cakes. Our host was friendly and attentive as he prepared out meat and told us about the different types of Korean BBQ.   I'm also a fan of the minimalistic decor and wooden art on the walls. Moo Woo saves us a lengthy trip to China Town for the Korean bbq we love. We ended up leaving with full happy bellies. Overall I would recommend this place to friends and would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This place is great! Just what we need in the NW part of Vegas! I hate driving all the way to Koreatown for good Korean BBQ. This place is super clean, food is delicious and the staff is really friendly. Prices are great- we got the moo combo and got a lot of food for the price. I loved the spicy chicken!!! Even better than all I've mentioned though is that this is a family restaurant and I love supporting the small business owners, we will ABSOLUTELY be back!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. We ordered the Moo combo.  Very interesting. Too much food for us so we took home enough meat for dinner tomorrow. The server and host were super friendly and patient. Wide variety of side dishes plus an egg which I think was steamed. It was light and fluffy. We will surely go back and order less food.    You have to be on the lookout for the location. The sign is up high and we saw it but when we got close, we drove right past the restaurant.   Great addition to the restaurants in Centennial Center."}
{"text":"This place knocked my socks off, I didn't expect much other than your typical Korean BBQ....but upon arrival the staff was attentive and fun. Then the food preparation, cleanliness, and exceptional taste was off the chain. Yep found our new favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"We love to have a Korean restaurant in north Las Vegas.  The food is good. Should get 4 stars.  Service is awful.   The waiter just put all the meat on the grill and wAlk away.  So the meat is over cooked and of course nobody cares.  The worst is we tried to order more fish cakes in 2 occasions and both times the wait staff said they ran out of fish cake.  That makes no sense because we were there at 6pm and customers still coming in.  We saw they served fish cake to the new customers.   So why can't they let us know only 1 serving of fish cake per table.  But of course this is not Korean way.... Right?   Go to Hobak in china town  from now on."}
{"text":"Our first Korean BBQ in Centennial Hills.  Fun place to eat with the family. Great good and Extremely friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food! Will definitely come back. The meat are fresh and the sides are delicious"}
{"text":"Does not measure up to any of the KBBQ places on Spring Mountain.  Ridiculously priced, $80 gets you less than 1.5 lbs of low quality meat that 4-5 people have to share.  You get ONE small bowl of soup that is also shared amongst your group, extra charge for everything.  To top it off it's freezing cold in there so your food takes forever to cook than the servers randomly turn the grill on and off while you're trying to cook a fatty sliver of brisket!  Good thing In n Out is close by."}
{"text":"This place was great!  The staff was awesome at explaining how it all worked and the food was amazing.  I was a bit shocked at the over all bill for 2 people being over $60 with out having any alcohol.  I guess not having much experience with this kind of restaurant I don't have much to compare it too.  Over all I would go again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Delicious. A little expensive but well worth it. Great traditional Korean bbq restaurant. Very good selection."}
{"text":"Good meat, a little slow on the service and no it wasn't that busy at all.  It's also very pricey.  Go here if you are not a fan of AYCE places or are in the northern part of Vegas."}
{"text":"This use to be our spot away from china town but it's not as pleasant as it use to be.  The food is excellent but the service is diminishing. Had dinner last week and we've decided not to return again. The waiter popped an attitude because we moved the meat on the grill. He said \"are we cooking the food or are you\". I tried to explain the flame was up to high. He said \"again...are we cooking the food or are you\" wow! Really? So we said you're cooking the food. My bf refused to touch the meat after since \"they were cooking the food\". Needless to say...3 out of the 6 cuts of meat were burnt because the waiter took his time coming back to us. We will waste the extra 20 mins driving to Chinatown in the future for our weekly Korean bbq night."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today. The restaurant has been open for about a month, and it looks spacious, modern and clean.   The Moo  combo are pork dishes $45 for small and $75 large and the Woo combo has beef dishes $53 small which is good for 2-3 people and $85 large for 3-4 people. We were hoping the combo would have both pork and beef but you have to order MooWoo combo which is $140 or 4-5 people. You can order individually but that would have been way too pricey compared to combo dishes.  We went with small Woo combo because we like beef more than pork.  It comes with prime brisket, bulgogi, rib-eye steak or boneless short rib, Joo Mul Luk (which is premium cut beef seasoned with garlic, pepper, and salt) and kalbi.  We went with the rib-eye steak. The dishes were accompanied by house salad, steamed egg, your choice of stew (soon tofu, kimchi, or bean paste), and corn cheese. I liked the bean paste stew. We also ordered spicy chicken wings which was ok, the chicken was soft.  The server cook your food which we like.  The girl at the table next to us started talking to us and was asking if we thought the food was pricey.  Overall, the food was just ok, a 3 stars with a 4 star pricing, we felt it was too pricey for what we got."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! I am so happy this placed opened. No they dont have AYCE (all you can eat) but honestly why would you want to stuff yourself so full of meat? We ordered the small beef combo for my husband, myself, and my son ($53 before tax). It was Plenty enough, we had to pack some to go.   SERVICE: Perfect. Our server was very attentive, friendly, and nice. They cooked the meat which I loved cause finally I can enjoy my meal! The owner even made her way to greet us.   FOOD: High quality meat. Makes all the other AYCE restaurant look bad. The side dishes(banchan) were a good variety and delicious. Coming from a Korean myself, it was authentic. Loved the soup (duangchang cheegae) and the fact it came out with our food and not in the end.  I don't know why people complain about it not being AYCE, I'm sure you really dont need all that food.    INTERIOR: Clean, spacious, and the tables are big! The dishes and water cup is not all cluttered in front of you. Great design!  Seriously has made me a regular. Love this place and if you want a great meal, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"We love this place!!! Bring everybody!!! Great food, great service!!! Nice and clean, awesome decor too, love the cows!!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing as was the service!! Loved the spicy ramen! Got the woo special and it was more than enough for two people. Each cut of meat was very delicious."}
{"text":"I've been on a search for the best bibimbap in Vegas and I think I've found the right one! It was my first time going to Moo Woo today. First of all, I LOVE that they opened a Korean food/ BBQ place in centennial. Most of the more popular places for kbbq are in Chinatown or the south side of Las Vegas, so I'm super happy it's in a closer distance to me. I got the bibimbap (since I have been craving) and my boyfriend got bulgogi . My food was too delicious I didn't bother to take a picture before I feasted. After our dinner the manager or owner approached us and gave us some free facial wipes and face mask, super random, but so nice! I'm most definitely coming back here in the near future"}
{"text":"Excellent! Scott and crew could not have been better, very impressed. I became a fan of Korean BBQ after a trip to Soul Korea and have frequented all of the Las Vegas offerings many times, Moo Woo is 10 minutes from home and is now my new favorite. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Go hungry.  We had the moo woo combo to get a taste of everything on the menu.  The meal was great and flavorful.  Well worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"The staff and food is amazing here. We met the owners and they are very friendly. The bon chon and meats had very good portion sizes. We had Mack as our server and he stayed past his shift and cooked for us. One of the owners, owns two more restaurants hanabi and musashi. We had a blast here talking to Mack and the owners. We will be coming here more since we love so close and don't have to go to China Town."}
{"text":"Food was ok. My order was wrong but The owner rushed out and apologized for the mistake. He allowed me to keep the wrong order while they worked on the correct order. Needless to say service was awesome. I think for portion size it was a little over priced. I don't plan on visiting soon but it's nice we have a Korean restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is a perfect addition to the Centennial Hills area.  We always had to go to Chinatown or the Southwest side of the valley to enjoy Korean barbecue.  They also have a large variety of other dishes if you don't want to eat a lot of meat.  The service and food was great and I was very pleased that their Soon dubu chige was one of the best I've tasted lately.  The only complaint would be that the venting system could be stronger.  We will definitely go back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the entire meal experience here.   Great food!  Meat was exceptional.  We will be coming back for sure..."}
{"text":"Wonderful delicious food! The shrimp brisket and chicken yummy! The service is A+.  Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing bulgogi and bibimbap!! Family also had Dak Bulgogi, Spicy Pork Bulgogi, Japchase - all absolutely delicious!! Atmosphere was awesome too!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for lunch after reading all the great reviews.  Sadly, I did not find the food as good as the reviews.  I ordered a Japchae (Korean stir-fried glass noodle) and a Korean ramen from their lunch menu.  The portion is on the smaller side.  The Japchae is similar in taste as many other Korean restaurants.  However, the bottom of the plate is soaked with oil.  The Korean ramen tastes like instant noodle in a pot.  May have to come back to try their BBQ instead."}
{"text":"First of all, 3 stars seems too little, but 4 stars seems too many for this restaurant. The atmosphere and the service are close to 4 stars.  The price, meat quality, and menu selection are close to 3 stars.   I have always been curious about Moo Woo because it is about the only Korean BBQ place in this area. Though the restaurant has close to 200 Yelp reviews with 4.5 stars, it's still a \"hidden spot.\" Not many people know about this restaurant simply because Chinatown has a ton of great KBBQ restaurants. It has a relatively quiet atmosphere. Unlike many other KBBQ restaurants with loud music and crowed set-ups, Moo Woo has less noise and uncongested table set-up. Is it because not many people know about the restaurant? Maybe. Even then, this is a more family friendly KBBQ spot than most.   The service was great. The servers were friendly and helpful. One of the servers brought wrong dishes to our table, but he realized it and quickly took them back. He seemed new. No biggie. We did not have to cook ourselves because the server grilled the entire combo throughout the meal. In terms of service, no complains.   Now, the price and food... the meat quality is not much better than AYCE KBBQ places. Some were too fatty... some were too dry... the rib-eye steak was cut wayyy to thin to be grilled... (anything less than medium-well is almost impossible) For the combo that serves 3-4 people, it was close to $90. The price would have been reasonable if the food quality backed it up. **The quality is NOT bad. It's just not as good as it should be. Better quality or price would have changed the entire experience.   Overall, Moo Woo was not bad. Nothing exceptional but nothing too disappointing either. It is a kids-friendly restsurant. If you want to have a family KBBQ dinner with kids, this is the right spot."}
{"text":"Finally amazing Asian food in the northwest! The owner is the most friendly and funny and hospitable guy ever. I came here for my birthday and we got the Moo Woo Combo for 5 people. The owner and staff made our meal perfect! The meat was so tender, flavorful and delicious! I loved their tofu and seafood soup. Go get yourself some bulgogi now!"}
{"text":"This place is wayyyy too over-priced!! Ive been to way better Korean spots in town and this place is disappointing! Venture out PLEASE! They have all you can eat Korean at Tofu Hut for the price of one dish here. REALLY! And their food here has no flavor. The servers were rude and didnt come around often, plus the place wasnt even crowded. NEVER COMING AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Everything was great. We had the woo combo (all beef). The service was excellent. Andy was great and everyone else helping was excellent also. They checked on us enough and answered all of our questions since it was our first time. Everyone was very friendly. The food was delicious. The meats, salad, soup, and side dishes were all hot and tasty. Must try! You will not be disappointed. I also liked the fact that everything was clean."}
{"text":"Wanted to try lunch here first in case it wasn't great. Well it was GREAT... the staff super friendly and attentive- love the experience. It's a place for amazing food and great friend of family conversation. Lunch menu is a little less expensive then the dinner menu but both are worth the value . At first glance maybe a little pricey but once you see and taste the food it's sooo worth it . Happy eating"}
{"text":"A must go. I now have a favorite place to go eat in the Northwest.  The service is excellent the person serving us cooked our meat for us at the table so we could enjoy ourselves. The meat was top quality and although not all you can eat we had all we needed. The side dishes were fresh and very good. I wish them well and hope they are here for years to come."}
{"text":"Oh yeah! Finally a decent Korean BBQ restaurant in the Northwest/Centennial Area. A great addition in an area that has been gaining a variety of delicious restaurants. Moo Woo is not an AYCE BBQ joint but they have combos in various sizes depending how large your party is and the option of adding more items to your meal. The quality of the meat is really good and notably I enjoyed their Banchan(side dishes). I recommend the melted cheese corn, this was one of our favorites of the evening and the kimchi was fresh and well seasoned with a good amount of heat.  The staff is friendly and they actually assist in helping you grill the meats in a timely manner while having a pleasant conversation with you. I thought I would be hungry after my meal but I was really satisfied with the food and was full.  2017 Yelp Review #87"}
{"text":"My husband raved about this place and I wasn't too crazy about it at first because when you hear BBQ you think actual BBQ. But I really like this place. It is very clean, food was delish, and staff was very friendly. Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Our experience was excellent service great and food was awesome the beef combo was really good"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Moo combo is a lot for 2 people. The servers are very quick and helpful. Definitely come back."}
{"text":"We recently discovered Moo Woo while driving by and stopped in that night, hoping it was good because we love Korean BBQ but don't like making the drive from our area. Moo Woo did not disappoint! Great food, and LOTS of it. Our party of 6 ordered a few combos. There were many different side dishes and they kept coming as we ordered more at no extra charge. We had 4 different types of beef and all were good and fun to cook, even though the waiter cooked a couple for us. The owner spent time with us and was a joy to talk to. The staff is very friendly as well. We will be back very soon and are so happy to have Korean BBQ in the neighborhood... especially one as great as Moo Woo."}
{"text":"We typically go to China Town for Korean BBQ but we took a chance at this neighborhood gem last night. Not only was the food amazing, the service here is comparable to visiting a 5-Star restaurant on the Strip. Everyone in our family down to our 4 year old really enjoyed ourselves last night and we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night. Great quality beef, pork and chicken. While our cook was cooking and preparing our meal, she explained what everything was. Awesome atmosphere. We had theMoo Woo combo, all 6 of us were stuffed. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Why waist your time going to China Town, when you can come here.You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Finally a new Korean BBQ near me! Love it! Food is great and the service is fast and friendly! Side dishes are fresh and the Kalbi is tastey! I will definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"My family is visiting from out of town and we decided to give MooWoo a try and were NOT disappointed. When we arrived it was very busy but we were seated without too long of a wait. The food was authentic, high-quality, and delicious. The atmosphere was fun and urban. What sealed the deal for us was our experience with the owners. Not only did they make our experience personalized but they provided great service even with the higher traffic than normal. We were so impressed! We even got a hug when we left. Highly recommended! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"THIS IS HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT EVER!! The staff is amazing and friendly, it's interior is really clean and sleek, and the food is amazing! It isn't as americanized as some other korean restaurants, and it's family owned. The staple I always get is the bulgogi, a must try!!"}
{"text":"Quality of food is delicious & great as well as the service!  You can't really put a price on quality. The portions provided are enough to keep you satisfied, but if you're looking for an all you can eat kbbq, the portions don't match up. Other than that everything is great."}
{"text":"We normally eat at DJK in Chinatown,  but the dinner here was fantastic. Especially considering we're in Centennial Hills! Rafael and Scott were awesome! We will definitely be back soon...maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"This restaurant exceeded all expectations. This Korean restaurant has a grill on each table, and after you order, the waiter brings out the meat raw and puts it on the grill. I've been to many Korean restaurants, but this type where they grill the meat in front of you is my favorite.   I ordered the spicy pork bulgogi and my wife ordered the house/sweet chicken. Both were excellent! Additionally, the traditional side dishes (Kimchi and such) were amazing, and our waiter refilled them when we ate them.   I highly recommend this place--I've lived in Las Vegas 2 years and only just found this place right up the road from where I live. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Only one korean restaurant in centennial and the food is so far so good but the price is little too high."}
{"text":"LOVE MOO WOO! With the exception of not sitting on floor pillows, it feels like I'm eating at a restaurant back in Korea. Food and staff are always on point.  Kamsa hamnida Moo Woo!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few Korean BBQ places that really didn't satisfy me. The foods flavor was very minimal and the portions are weak as well. I spent too much to not enjoy it."}
{"text":"New Korean restaurant in Northwest Las Vegas! No long drives to Chinatown anymore, yay! Great food, service on point and clean modern environment. It's not AYCE but we got the large beef combo and it was a lot of food for 5 people we had to take some home. They have TV's for sports games too! Come check them out!"}
{"text":"Amazing, except for the absurdly high prices.  Pros: The place looks great, very modern and nice. I love that they have big screen TVs that are easily viewable from anywhere.  The staff were very attentive and pleasant. Best service I've ever had at a Korean BBQ, or even most restaurants.  The meat that I had was good quality. Servings were of good size for solo or two, though for a party of three or more, you'll definitely want more.  Lots of complimentary small side dishes.  Good to finally have one in the Centennial Area.  Cons:  Holy schneikies its pricey! I ordered only two meat dishes with water and it was $48 (Marinated beef and unmarinated pork belly). That's absurdly expensive for Korean BBQ and will, unfortunately, keep me from coming back unless the prices go down.  The staff cook the meat for you. Definitely a sign of very good service, however, at least for me, it takes away from the experience to not cook it myself.  No smaller or half orders if you want to mix and match more."}
{"text":"Centennial is coming up!!  Soon, there will be no reason to ever leave the Centennial area.  Moo Woo Korean BBQ is the first KBBQ that I know of in the area.  The good news...we no longer have to drive 25 minutes to Chinatown to get our KBBQ cravings taken care of.    Moo Woo KBBQ is new and right now, it's still almost a secret.  I drive by this location at least once a week and rarely do I see tons of cars outside or lines of people waiting.  This place just doesn't get enough hype or people out here just don't do KBBQ.  Regardless, they are missing out because Moo Woo is pretty damn good.    Here's a quick menu breakdown: Moo Combo (All Pork) - Small $45 (2-3 people) / Large $75 (3-4 people) Woo Combo (All Beef) - Small $53 (2-3 people) / Large $85 (3-4 people)   Moo Woo Combo (Pork & Beef) - $140 (4-5 people)  All combos come with an App, a salad, steamed egg, choice of stew (tofu, Kimchi, or bean paste), and corn cheese.  You can also order your meats a la carte.  Just keep in mind that it will cost about the same as a combo since it's a two item minimum.  Chicken and fish is also on the menu in case you're wondering.   I'm not a huge pork lover, bored of chicken, and didn't come here for fish.  So, we ended up getting the Woo Combo. You're given the option to cook the meats yourself or have one of the servers do it.  I'm all about relaxing and our server ended up doing all the work.  If I had to rank my favorites in order, it would be the Bulgogi, seasoned beef, and Kalbi. All were cooked to perfection and had that taste of quality beef.  The only disappointment for me was the size of their corn cheese and steamed egg.  This came with our combo and is only enough to serve one person.  But it's really no big deal since we came for the meat, not the sides.  Overall, I recommend this restaurant if you're in the area and in need of some good KBBQ.  The quality is as good as Chinatown's minus the drive and long wait times.   2017 Yelp Review #56"}
{"text":"Great service!! The owner was so personable and she even gave my family and I a hug when we left. We ordered the combination special. It was enough to feed 6 people. I couldn't even eat any more. It came with brisket, rib eye steak, prime boneless short rib, seasoned cut beef, korean short rib, prime pork belly, thinly sliced marinated pork, pork jowl, chicken, and beef.  It was delicious. They also gave two options of soup, egg, rice, and all the mini sides. Definitely would go back!!"}
{"text":"Good food, it's nice and clean. Services are great. So Its a good place to dine in. We'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and great people. My son wanted to go there for his 16th BIRTHDAY and the waiter overheard us saying it was his birthday. At the end of the meal they surprised him and our entire family with a birthday dessert and song."}
{"text":"First time eating Korean BBQ... and I will tell ya, this place is AMAZING!! not only is the food spectacular! But wait.. there's more... the staff is EPIC!! No clue how to use their nice chopsticks, staff quickly saw that and offered my son and I some trainers which were definitely needed. If you're a pro with the sticks, you'll be fine. Definitely definitely recommend and can't wait to bring the wife back. Father son night tonight"}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a Korean BBQ place come in this area. I love the flavors and concepts of similar restaurants. While the food here was okay the service was a little disappointing. I am use to Korean BBQ places allowing my to cook on my own so each party member can have beef to their done liking. I was scolded by a worker when placing food on the rack, who then hovered over us for the rest of the meal causing most of the food to be over well done and burnt. Not happy."}
{"text":"First time here, great options! High quality meat. Love how staff lets you know all the ingredients to what they are serving. Clean, large tables unlike most Korean spots. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very satisfying. Great customer service and nice spot to take friends and family. Highly recommended if your on the north west area."}
{"text":"No more trips to Spring Mountain for Korean BBQ. A must eat Korean restaurant in the northwest area and the only Korean BBQ in the area. Owners and staff very friendly and provide awesome service!"}
{"text":"This is the best Korean BBQ out there! Everyone needs to come here. Scott and Rafaela are the best!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The food is delicious and the hospitality is unparalleled--So impressed!!  They offer lunch specials too. Prices might seem a little high, but for the amount of food and the quality, it's well worth it!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here. I've had it on my list for a while because I was so elated that there was a kbbq place closer to my side of town. I love kbbq but driving and parking in Chinatown isn't always appeasing. Anyways, came in tonight. Smelled great. Servers were nice. However we were totally ignored. The place wasn't really full of patrons but our grill burnt. Our meat burnt. I had to literally flag down the server every time for more drinks etc. I feel bad that this was my friend's first experience with kbbq. I'll just continue to drive to spring mountain and won't be back."}
{"text":"YUCK.  Both Seafood Noodle Soup and Hot Pot BIMBImbap were not not good.  Sorry, maybe we should have ordered the bbq."}
{"text":"Great food, great experience, however the food is slightly expensive... But well worth it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with the portions. We ordered the galbi which had 3 strips, which we assumed would be paper thin but it was a little thicker. The spicy dak galbi was not spicy. The onions added to the spiciness but the marinade did not overwhelm the chicken. The steamed egg was like diving into a fluffy light omelette. The sizzling corn cheese was ok but nothing like a pub. They side condiments were generous and were never empty which reflected in there attention to us."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been frequent visitors to this place since they have opened. This is our go-to spot when we aren't in the mood for AYCE. The food is always delicious and the service is good. Your food is cooked at your table for you, however, there have been times when our food has been slightly overcooked because they are busy or the servers are busy doing other things. It's definitely worth trying, just make sure to keep an eye on your food."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm lucky to have a job that allows me to visit restaurants throughout Las Vegas. This is a new restaurant only a few months in business. Had a great dining experience, the owner and staff were very nice and love what they do. Food presentation and attention to detail with tasty authentic Korean BBQ - family style cooking was A+. If you are a local foodie or international foodie, Moo Woo should be your next stop if you are wanting to try something new. I know quality of food is very important along with keeping their customers happy! Thank you Moo Woo Korean BBQ LV for the fantastic food and hospitality!"}
{"text":"Moo Woo may be my new favorite Korean BBQ spot. Note: Not AYCE.  The Woo Combo AKA red meat lovers galore is my personal favorite and my recommendation:  ** $56 for an order to feed 2 - 3 people  ** $89 for an order to feed 3 - 4 people  Servings of: - Chadol (Thinly sliced brisket) - Kalbi (LA style short rib) - Bulgogi (Marinated beef) - Jumulleok (Precut lightly seasoned pieces of steak) - Seng Dung Shim (Prime ribeye steak)  The combo of course comes with salad, a variety of side dishes (love the fish cakes here and the kimchi is always ripe and tasty), as well as steamed egg, corn cheese, and soup (bean paste, tofu, or kimchi).   Food:  - Quality meat! Their meat is also never frozen, always refrigerated and fresh  - Marinades are delicious. The best marinaded Kalbi and Bulgogi I've tasted in a Las Vegas Korean restaurant  - Brisket is incredibly tender and juicy - The Ribeye Steak literally melts in your mouth. Recommend eating medium rare - medium  - Kimchi Jun (Korean pancake - not part of the combo) is simple yet delectable   Service:  - Every server is friendly and attentive! We've had multiple servers come by our table both times I've been to Moo Woo to offer additional side dishes, water, check if we're enjoying our meal, and also assist with grilling. Super friendly and welcoming - excellent service all around!   Ambiance:  - Very open; great lighting and ventilation  - Love the seating!! The bench style seating is incredibly roomy and makes a very comfortable dining experience. Usually Korean restaurants can be a bit crammed (seating and table size) and it's the complete opposite at Moo Woo   Highly recommend Moo Woo!! I wish it was closer to where I live (it's so far north!) but it's definitely even worth the 30+ minute drive."}
{"text":"Fresh meats/seafood, great service, very clean.  I drove all the way down to centennial to try this new bbq place.  This place is amazing.  Come and try out!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant! The servers are attentive and friendly. The food is delicious and the meat is great quality. While it's not AYCE, the combos are the perfect amount of food. The Woo Combo for 2-3 people was perfect for my husband, my daughter, and me. The restaurant itself was clean and bright. Everything came together to make this an amazing experience! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The wife and I went on a Saturday about noon. She ordered the spicy pork and I had garlic beef. The service was very good, the meat was some of the best quality that we have had at Vegas Korean places. Sides were okay they could have 2 or 3 more. The do charge for extra rice and prices were okay but a little high. The place is one of the nicer places. We live in Henderson and love the places on Spring Mtn, but will add this one for when we feel like a drive."}
{"text":"THE BEST KOREAN BBQ IN TOWN!!! My family and I have tried other Korean BBQ like Sura and Gen which are ok but it does not compare to the quality and taste of the meats at Moo Woo. It's located in a really nice side of town north west. Very clean and great atmosphere with plenty of room for big families like mine. The waiters are super friendly and even explain the kinds of meats you're ordering especially if you are new to Korean BBQ. Overall a great experience and we left satisfied and SUPER FULL so you definitely get your money's worth! I highly recommend Moo Woo! We will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Moo Woo! If you're not in the mood for AYCE Korean BBQ, this place is a must try! They're are different combinations to choose from, but everything is delicious haha. The service is great and the owner always tries to make conversation with his customers. Definitely not used to having someone cook for me, but it's nice to see how Korean BBQ is cooked because we always end up making the grill black lol."}
{"text":"My wife and I love to go here. The bulgogi is the best. You fell like your at home when you are eating."}
{"text":"Beyond impressed with this place! All the meats were so juicy and tender, the staff were incredibly attentive and friendly. Best kbbq I've tried by far!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff, amazing food, cleanly, perfect for a group lunch or date night. Every time we've eaten there the owners have stopped by to greet & meet us, it's how dinning should be and we love it!"}
{"text":"Came during the Olympics in Korea... they had them on the tvs in there... my kids were super stoked.  The food was amazing. They are so kind to take the time to explain what each of the side items are and how to enjoy each one.  The soup is super spicy, but my husband loved that.  I loved the salad so it was a good trade off.  The corn was so yummie.  But the meats, my mom who is almost 70, and never had Korean food in her life was taking the smallest nibbles off of the grill so they were not lost."}
{"text":"Not the best Korean BBQ in town but it's an incredible addition to the NW. Our family loves it especially our 8 year old. It's clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great high quality food, we ordered the moo woo combo for 6 people and it was more than enough. lots of food! Had a great time here, place very open and clean and super cool that they cook for you! Jennifer was our cook and she was the coolest sweetest and funniest server, great attitude and conversation during our time there! Very happy to have found this place and will be back very very soon!"}
{"text":"What  an amazing meal and experience . Food was excellent meat was very tender staffs are nice and friendly . all the side dish was good  all my family was so happy after the   meal"}
{"text":"They have really great service, good cuts of meat and a very nice Korean BBQ experience. I'd definitely go back here, the service is what was a stand out. The gentleman waiting on our table ended up assisting in making sure our selection of meats were cooked just right."}
{"text":"First time here. Service is really good and friendly Good tast excellent We took a woo combo you will get 5 different meat More then enough. Love the add on Price affordable for Korean BBQ Good place to go!"}
{"text":"If you want higher quality Koren BBQ and don't mind spending the extra money, this place is a great choice.   Try to have Rafael as your sever, he not only took great care of us but also made sure we had recommendations for all over vegas!!"}
{"text":"Our family loves finding new Korean restaurants and Moo Woo is a great find.  We always go to Spring Mountain to eat and now we do not have to go that far.  Moo Woo Kbbq is clean, staff are very friendly and most of all, food is great.  We went there last night and ordered the small family serving of \"Woo\" and were not disappointed at all.  Meat is super tender, juicy and of high quality.  The side dishes could use a little improvement, need more variety.  The amount of banchan is very little. The kimchi is only two pieces and you have to asked for more.  I highly recommend Moo Woo and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Moo woo is great food was bomb and service was great all I can say is it's a good 5 stars and reasonable priced if u ask me."}
{"text":"The service there is pretty good but it could be better. The food was really good but overpriced compared to those in Chinatown. Happy to have something up north here"}
{"text":"The food and service is excellent here. Thank god it's in the North West and I don't have to go to Chinatown anymore for good Korean BBQ! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this place because it's great service, clean and quality meat!  Always a good setting for family and great conversation!  We come here at least once a week!  New crave and finally..... a great Asian restaurant on the Northwest side of town!!!!!!    Can't get enough of this place!  Thanks Raphael for always making sure our experience is amazing!"}
{"text":"Became very ill after eatting here. Food did not taste good either. Would not recommend eatting here."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Rib eye steak has 1\" of fat surrounding it. Brisket was mostly fat and sliced as thin as they could get it. The short ribs and bulgogi were good but the exact same as Costco bulgogi and loaded with fat. I do not call you his good meat. Good service but waaay overpriced at $56 for 2. I prefer the Japanese BBQ near the strip where the meat is waaay better and half the price. Ice cream is not included like at the Japanese BBQ. I will not return."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Saturday with a party of 5 and it was very good.  We had the Moo Woo combo after getting the dumplings as an appetizer.  The food was plentiful and the accompaniments were very adequate.  The only issue was that there was only 1 server available in the entire place for the first 4/5 of our meal.  If there were more than 2 tables occupied, it would have been a real problem.  As it was, she was busting her butt to keep up and after the final service of food, disappeared.  We had to wait a significant time before we could get our check, and had to flag down a different server (who had just arrived)."}
{"text":"Came here thru Yelp based on rating and my god it was amazing. Fresh meat and amazing cook service. I am allergic to seafood and the gentlemen was knowledgable about the foods an the grill. Even grilled all the meat first before the seafood. Very greatful to beable to experience it all cause of food cross contamination, it was the best experience! And humorous cook too haha."}
{"text":"A great place for a big Korean meal!  Grills in the table where the food is cooked by your chef to order.  We had the Moo platter which came with steak, brisket, spicy chicken, and two types of pork.  All fantastic: tasty, tender, and juicy.  All the usual Korean condiments. We chose the kimchi soup as one of the sides, and it is tasty with small bits of pork.  Recommended!  Not a place for a quick meal, so be ready to sit back and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is awesome! I was in South Korea for a while and loved the BBQ there and this place is very similar. Great place to try it out and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This is our second time here. Love the food. And the service. We're going to come back soon."}
{"text":"This is The BEST Korean in town. I promise you this is a must eat! The service is EXCEPTIONAL and the food is as quality as quality gets!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try!!! The meats are quality, flavor is perfect and portions are good size.  Try the 2-3 person combo. Great buy!!  The place is very clean and service is good.  I will come back again. This is the spot!!!"}
{"text":"Just went there with my friends, they are way better than some of Korean BBQ in China town . Good foods, and great service . So far this is my favorite Korean BBQ"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing!!!! Our fist time eating Korean BBQ. Our server Mac was amazing he took care of us every step of the way. Will definitely be back! Thanks for a great date night!!"}
{"text":"Moo Woo is the gem of the food places for the next 5 mile radius. Yeah, you know it's kinda true.   It is NOT AYCE. However, I thought that the Moo and Woo combos were reasonably priced at around $60 and they are appropriate portions (they feed 2-3, and we were a group of 3). Along with sides, you also receive a steamed egg, cheese corn, and your choice of available soups.   They do the cooking for you, which is a nice change of pace. However, I wish that they had disclosed this information when we informed them that it was our first time eating at Moo Woo. It would have made things slightly less awkward and confusing.   If you like to eat a lot, if you prefer and can handle AYCE better because you like the wide range of things you can order, this is probably not the place for you. It's more along the lines of..a casual date with a friend...a romantic outing with your hubby...or maybe you just wanted Korean BBQ but you're so lazy that you don't want to cook it yourself.   I was pretty impressed to eat here. For a location on the NW side, Moo Woo would probably be getting a 5 star rating if it weren't for the many neighbor's meats I saw that the attending cook let overcook on accident. They just need more cooks wandering the floor."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a Korean BBQ joint to open up north!! Finally got one and a good one at that! I tend to get their soup extra spicy to go with the fixings on the side. Anyways, great tasting food and friendly service! I hope they do well!"}
{"text":"Just a quick update:    This place is so fantastic. We've been here 5x now, and we can't get enough!   It was super packed tonight. And that makes me happy.  They added a new combo thats for 4-5 people. And man, with three dudes and two girls, we ate a TON. They seriously give you an abundance of food and it's all amazing! The best meats we've had here so far: Boneless Korean short rib Pork belly  Spicy Pork   But they're all so good. I've taken a few friends here, and everyone is so impressed with the prices, service and the quality.  I can't tell you how happy this place makes me. I'm obsessed with Korean BBQ, and this is by far one of the best places in town.  Keep supporting this business! We need variety up here in Centennial!"}
{"text":"The food was very interesting I didn't care for the taste but that's because we never had it before; what determined the bad review is that my fiancé and I became terribly ill after eating here"}
{"text":"I like this place because real korean style... so many places is not really..... I'm so happy thank you for open. this aerial is not a lot of BBQ place.... I will be there soon."}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ!  Had to minus a star because one of our dishes was burnt at the bottom.   Our party of 4 came on a Wednesday night around 6 pm and were promptly sat at a booth.  Our server, Raphael, was very personable.  We ordered the Woo combo for 3-4 people (all beef meats), seafood pancake (came burnt at the bottom), and Dduk bok ki.    Everything was great!  Except the semi burnt seafood pancake.  They also refill the banchan when its empty!  The food for Woo combo plus our extra dishes was more than enough for our party of 4, but we are heavy eaters.  For other parties who might want to not eat so heavy, if you order additional sides with the combo, you might want to go down from 3-4 people to 2-3 people.  Which is probably what we should have done!  Lol!"}
{"text":"Great kbbq place in the northwest part of town.  Me and the gf ordered the combo big enough for like 4-5 people and it filled us lol.  Just wish the sides were filled up more we ended up asking for 3-4 refills of sides.  Other than that, great atmosphere, location, and staff."}
{"text":"The short rib and Wang kalbi IS AMAZING! I am very picky with my Korean barbecue and MooWoo does not disappoint one bit. Very tender, perfectly marinated, and reasonable pricing for the quality you are getting. Usually service in Korea BBQ restaurants is lackluster but MooWoo hires friendly happy servers that want to make your dining experience great. We will definitely be returning. We live in Henderson and it's definitely worth the drive! The owners are extremely welcoming and makes sure every guest in there is doing well.  The interior is very very clean and organized. The tables are very wide and spacious, so all your side dishes, drinks and meats don't get clustered all over and you don't have to fight with your partner for elbow room. 5 stars well deserved!"}
{"text":"The waiter moo'd and woo'd me I luv this place his service was great and entertaining his name mac or something ask for him!"}
{"text":"A lot of food,  really good!!  Very attentive service,  and they're very nice!  You have to try it out!  So happy to have more variety in Centennial Hills!!!"}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ with amazing guest service. Quick and casual at a decent price point. A little disappointed on the sides as I didn't really think corn with cheese was ideal for Korean food. There was no wait which is due to it not being an all you can eat Korean BBQ which I think was great."}
{"text":"Tried some items off the lunch menu, they were delicious! The atmosphere is really nice and we love their dishes. Only reason for a 4-star review is pricing. After enjoying Gen Korean BBQ at Galleria Mall and Gyu Kaku in the center of town with all you can eat menu options or way lower pricing, it is hard to want to pay double or more for the same exact food."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here and it was fantastic. The food is delicious and they use high quality meat. The service is attentive and they are always helpful with any questions. Highly recommend Woo combo! It has different styles of marinated beef and all the Korean favorite dishes."}
{"text":"For the price, it comes with ALOT of food. The food is delicious! Try the place as soon as you can because this place will always be busy in the future."}
{"text":"Our waiter was vetlry kind and generous, she cooked for us and always check on us back and forth for the whole time, the food is great service is amazing and the varietys of dishes and meat to choose from is slot. The appetizer or flavors to start off with are over welming for example there was many, mini dishes on both sides for a family of 4 and the combos are really, really worth it. This place is a very good, clean and OK priced resruraunt."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Some Korean BBQ have you cook your own food but if you don't know what you're doing you 'll overcook it.  Here the servers helped prepare the food just right.  The prices were fair.  We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Having good KBBQ restaurants in the north side is quite rare so, this place is a much welcomed addition. It's not AYCE but they have combinations for a reasonable price and big portions.  We've tried the Moo Combo, Woo Combo, and the Moo Woo Combo. All three comes with brisket, rib eye, banchan, steamed egg, corn cheese, and your choice of soup (sundobu, kimchi stew or bean paste stew). Moo Combo also has pork Belly, pork collar butt, sweet chicken or spicy chicken. Woo Combo has premium cut beef, marinated beef, and short rib. Moo Woo Combo has pork Belly, short Rib, spicy pork, pork jowl, sweet chicken, and butter garlic shrimp. The Moo Combo and the Woo Combo serves 2-3 people. Moo Woo serves 4-5 people.  Their bibimbap is good. Everything we've tried so far has been good and I simply cannot find any flaws other than the somewhat grumpy guy that greets you and takes you to your table - like a host but he also buses tables. He's got RBF perfected that he makes me look like a very cheerful person. However, they have this super awesome server and I can never remember his name but he remembers us. He knows the drill: that we come here post workout, and that I don't eat animal fat so he cuts it off the meat so I don't have to. Good memory, friendly, and attentive. He's a real asset to Moo Woo.  They change out the grill often unlike some places that wait until the meat gets caked onto the grill. So, if ever you're in this area, be sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was fantastic! The owner himself served us, he was friendly and offered some great suggestions. Place was clean and all of the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Bring your appetite! Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the food was fantastic. Will definitely eat here again. A great place to go on a date."}
{"text":"The food was good but keep in mind I only had one item since I was limited on time. They play K Pop which I always appreciate when a restaurant plays music from the area they represent. In the future I will update when I come back for dinner"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I tried MooWoo for the first time yesterday. We loved it! At first we were iffy about going to a kbbq place that isn't all you can eat, but the combos come with more than enough. We got the Woo combo. The employees cook the meat for you instead of you doing it yourself. That's different, but nothing wrong with it! The quality of meat was really high quality compared to other kbbq places. They were melt in your mouth good! I'm so happy there is one on this side of the valley. We live down the street. So excited that we don't need to drive far for good kbbq."}
{"text":"Last night I ventured to our first (in centennial hills) korean bbq restaurant. We arrived a little after 5 so the place was about half full. We were seated shortly after we walked in. We ordered the Moo combo which included pork belly, pork butt, brisket, ribeye, and sweet chicken. We also ordered steamed rice for 4. The ban chan were all freshly prepared and the vegetables maintained their crunchy texture. The bean curd soup didn't smell that great but packed in the flavor regardless. The first grill on the table was like a mesh grill. When we were left with our plater of raw meats we started piling them on the grill, only to have a random waitress come over and pull off the beef brisket slices and seemingly admonish us for putting them on the grill. We couldn't understand a word she said but I got the point that we weren't supposed to be placing meat on the grill. Shortly after she left I saw her do the same thing to another table nearby as they had filled their mesh grill with meat. Another male server came by and explained the smaller pieces of meat go on a different grill that they change out after the ribeye is cooked on the mesh grill. Anyway, the meats were all delicious, my favorite being the brisket and pork belly. The sauces were refilled upon request and we all got face masks and wipes with my yelp checkin. I noticed they have lunch specials so we will definitely be back to try them. They even have ramen!   My only suggestion is that they give you instructions on the platter or raw meat prior to leaving it on your table and walking away."}
{"text":"1st time here and it was very relaxing to have them do all the work ( cutting, cooking and serving).  Yeah, I know how to cook but sometimes I like to just enjoy the meal.  Personally, I like to dine out for the pure pleasure  of eating.  If you share this same concept then this is the place.  Great service, quality meat and good ventilation for everyone in the restaurant.   Will be back to get spoiled again."}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean, bathroom is clean.   Food well seasoned and large portions. Moo woo combo would feed 6-8 people, I think.  For the price of that combo, they should add more shrimp, take out some of the meat.   They like to cook the meat for you, but when it got busy, some of the meat started to char so we had to take over, that was fine for me.   Would probably go there again."}
{"text":"BOO MOOWOO! I was super excited to return to Moo Woo and had told many friends about our first great experience.  Unfortunately this time was so bad we walked out without even dining.   We can in on a Friday night and there was only one other party in the restaurant. My party was seated at a table that was preset with food... We ask the server why there was food already at our table and if they had changed their surfing methods... we were told it was for another party who either left or hadn't shown up for dinner.   We all found this to be odd to say the least.  Having asked the server to bring us fresh dishes kimchi and salad. The waiter told us sitting there on the table for no more than 25 minutes and was unwilling to provide us with fresh salads.  I'm fairly certain there's some health code violations with that tight there...  I'm sorry but think what you may of me but I don't go to a nice restaurant to pay money for someone else's leftovers.  We walked out when the waiter decided to argue with us rather than bring us fresh food.  With that kind of care and concern for their customers and the food they serve I would be very cautious about eating here as someone's going to get very sick.  The owner was contacted about our experience and found no issue with the service we received.  Once again I say shame on you MooWoo"}
{"text":"BOOOO HOOOO MOO WOO! I only give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because its on the other side of town. Legit 29 minutes. (WAH!) When I crave Korean BBQ, its' MOO WOO. Quality Bulgogi AND slippery Jap Chae. My two other Korean BBQ picks serve somewhat dry Jap Chae and don't even serve Bulgogi. The free hand art when you first walk in is fun and you are immediately greeted by staff! Although the air is filled with that smell (lets face it, you can't avoid smelling like BBQ on your clothes all the way home) the establishment is clean and airy.   My favorite side dish is steamed egg which is cooked perfectly here, soft and moist. I did have to ask for it thou- I thought it was usually brought to the table.  To top off every visit, the owner Scotty is so fun and friendly. I love a family owned businesses. Locals have a special love for us and I always consider that when reviewing!   As far as the surroundings and the atmosphere- I was very much jealous of the table next to us! They were having the best time. Sake bombs and some cheering. I was with the kids so I couldn't partake or else I would have reached over for a pour! HAHA since I saw one of the owners standing at the end of the table and pouring drinks, I had asked if he was a friend of the table and they replied, \"NO!! He's just so cool and keeping us company!\" Personally, It's contagious and makes me want to come back. Kinda like that tv show \"Cheers\" \"Where somebody knows your name\""}
{"text":"First time here for both of us! We were looking for something different and had not had Korean barbecue since we left California where we liven close to Korea town. This turned out to be a great idea. We had the Moo Woo combo #2 and they let Bev  substitute a grilled sweet chicken for the Brisket! Bev loves chicken. A side dish of Cheesy corn was so good we ordered 2 more.  Caution when walking towards restaurant a step comes out of no where and even though the edge is yellow I missed it. A little pricy the combo we choose was$56 for the two of us. We would come again in a few months for  sure."}
{"text":"Yummy Korean BBQ! Service was excellent, food  was superb, and atmosphere was fun and relaxed. Reminds us of back home in SoCal! Jake was a great server and friendly. Highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal Korean food.  Very friendly staff and owners.  They cook the food for you as well.  Brand new restaurant.  Check it out!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Loved this one!  Food is delicious and filling!  The owner is Fabulous and there is a Wonderful Staff that was so gracious that made our dining experience even more so pleasant!! Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Love their lunch specials since the dinner menu seems kind of pricey.  We usually have the bulgogi and it never disappoints! Rice is great quality! And the fried dumplings are amazing!  Service is alway quick! It's nice to finally not have to drive all the way down to Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Delicious food , huge portions with great service. My wife and I really enjoyed eating late lunch here. Plenty of sides to go with your meat and all delicious. Servers were on top of everything and answered all questions promptly. Definitely hit this spot up for some unique and tasty food."}
{"text":"Delicious! We had 3 lunch specials. L. A. Galbi, Bul Go Gi, spicy pork. All 3 were priced amazingly and tasted great. Service was friendly and kept us refilled. Restaurant was very clean as well. We'll be back for the bbq combo dinner soon."}
{"text":"A couple of guys from work and I decided to have lunch here. The restaurant is spacious and clean and the service here is top notch.  The tables are granite topped, and the grills are squeaky clean. You can tell they take cleaning seriously.   Prices and portions are reasonable and the food comes out blazing hot too. Can't ask for much more than that!  Banchans were plentiful and they were always willing to bring you more if you really liked something. The servers stayed on top of drinks and none of us went thirsty.   I will definitely be coming here a lot because I live nearby and the food is great."}
{"text":"Tons of food, great service. This was my first Korean BBQ experience so, I have nothing to compare it to but overall I was very happy. They give you 6-8 pickled dishes that are all refillable, soup, cheese corn (melted cheese with sweet corn kernels), scrambled egg, salad, and tons of meat. My only complaint was I wish they had more sauces to dip the meat in, to switch up flavors a bit. They give you one ponzu type sauce and a bean curd type sauce ( very funky). It's best to go with 3 or more people. With just two of us we couldn't even finish all the meat they gave us."}
{"text":"Really really good!! We'll absolutely be back!! The music was great too!! We were dancing in our seats!! Lol"}
{"text":"I've never been to a Korean BBQ before but my cousin who is married to a Korean invited us to come with them. They said this is the most authentic one that they have been to in the states yet. The food and service was outstanding! I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Had the woo moo combo. The rib eye and boneless short rib are great! Can't wait to try the pork and other combo's."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Korean BBQ place in Vegas. The staff are very very Friendly and it's always a happy vibe when eating here. The place is clean and comfortable. I love the different BBQ combo you can choose from their menu."}
{"text":"Mooooove on into this new KBBQ spot in the Centennial neighborhood, a welcome sight for those of us who live out here and don't always want to travel to Chinatown for a fix.  Located in the very busy Centennial area that's made up of mostly chain restaurants, Moo Woo is a spacious and bright alternative and is perhaps the only KBBQ restaurant for miles.  Service started off slowly since we were sat immediately and then left alone for longer than I'm comfortable with; I actually got to the point where I wanted to walk out.  However, after we were noticed, things improved.  Our waiter took our order and the food started arriving.  We went with the small Moo Woo order because we like beef more than pork.  It comes with prime brisket, bulgogi, rib-eye steak or boneless short rib, Joo Mul Luk (premium cut beef seasoned with garlic, pepper, and salt) and kalbi.  We chose the rib-eye steak, which was the first cut on the bbq.  Banchan dishes were accompanied by house salad (very tasty dressing), steamed egg, your choice of stew (soon tofu, kimchi, or bean paste), and corn cheese.  Unfortunately, I never got our waiter's name, but he was very attentive and checked on us often.  My favorites were the seasoned beef (Joo Mul Luk) and the kalbi.  This is definitely a spot that's welcome out here and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service and good food, it really is as good as it gets.  We ordered the Moo combo and the meat was very fresh.  It is a little daunting so see slabs of meat in front of you but have no fear, Moo Woo's servers soon swoop by and cook them to order.  Particular praise goes out to  Raphael, really attentive and fast.  He's really good at what he does.  I flipped my rib eye and 3 seconds later, Raphael appeared table side and checking on it.  After I told him I already flipped it, he adjusted it so it could have the perfect diamond grill marks, talk about attention to details.    Highly recommended and a welcome addition to the North side."}
{"text":"No AYCE here, but don't despair. The best deal seems to be ordering 2 a la carte meats, which will feed 2 adults, 2 kids for about same price or less as AYCE elsewhere. You get salad, steamed egg and soybean paste soup too.  At lunch we were seated quickly, banchan served immediately and the meats were grilling before we knew it. The bulgogi marinade was great. Even the rice you can tell is of higher quality than usual. This place definitely will draw us away from Korean bbq in Chinatown and it's a lot closer. Only drawback might be how busy Ann Road and Centennial Dr have gotten, but oh well, Vegas is booming."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood is all I have to say.  Excellent food and great service.  Don't change a thing."}
{"text":"It's still a solid choice for Korean BBQ. No complaints. Our servers cooked the meat properly and refilled our side dishes promptly. Out of all the side dishes, their kimchi and fish cake are my favorite. For the meat the ribeye and short ribs are their best cuts."}
{"text":"My new favorite Korean bbq spot. The prices are just about the same as ayce but the quality was much better. I also love the fact that I don't have to cook my food. There is a chef that cooks it for you right on the table. The hubby loved the cheese corn. They actually use shredded cheese instead of Velveeta. We got a combo for 2 and ordered a side of kalbi. Way too much food for us so we had left overs. And I love that its not in China town and closer to our house."}
{"text":"We have been driving by this place waiting for it to open.  Finally had the chance to try it and it was to die for!  The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful.   They do not have AYCE but for a good reason. It's about quality. The marble in our steak was beautiful. You can tell the meat is high quality.    We will definitely be regulars there."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Their tables are big and comfortable compared to other Korean BBQ places in town. The fire used to cook the meat at the table is great size. Because of the large size, it may look like the meat proportion is small, but it really isn't. Great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. The people are very nice and lunch and dinner were great. We shall be back many times."}
{"text":"Good food.....great service! Will definitely go back and explore the menu a bit more, not much for a vegetarian to choose from though."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ in the valley!  My family always enjoys our time together when dining at Moo Woo."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been there several times since they've opened and have always had great food and service. The owner always comes out and chats with the customers & makes sure everyone is happy. He has even walked my friends & I out of the restaurant, holding the door & thanking us for coming. I legit have nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I went here last night to celebrate his birthday since we just saw this place after a Total Wine run.   Service was fantastic. Our server/cook explained what everything was and was eager to answer any questions we had about the food.   Dinner itself was awesome.  We got the Woo dinner for two and it was a perfect amount of food.  We were asked how we would like our rib eye cooked and it done to our request which was great!    We also had a choice of soups and we got the Tofu soup per the recommendation of our server. The broth was so flavorful and we were so happy to try a new soup.  Kudos for the recommendation - we'd definitely order it again.   All in all, Moo Woo's has a lot of good things going for it and I would highly recommend checking the place out - Especially if you live in the Northwest side of town."}
{"text":"This is our second time coming to Moo Woo..   The food is great quality, and the flavors are amazing. The small plates of kimchi and pickled vegetables are made in house, they are fresh and VERY TASTY.  We ordered the Woo Combo, it was filling and left us satisfied..  We will be coming back for MORE!"}
{"text":"I love this place second time here and I love it.. food is awesome. Good flavor. I recommend this place specially to the meat lovers like me, this place is the best place to enjoy a nice juicy delicious piece of meat.."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to try this place because of their great reviews and when I finally did, it was a big disappointment.  Their combo meal prices were a little expensive and the quality of meat they served were mediocre.  We tried the Moo Woo combo; the ribeye was small and chewy (felt like I was eating a jerky), brisket was bland same as the pork neck.  Finally the chicken that tasted like a glazed BBQ flavor.  The banchan dishes tasted weird.  The only thing my family liked was the soup, I forgot which one it was but we tried the most popular one. Sadly to say I will not be back and cannot recommend this resto to friends and family.  Try Hobak instead!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite to go for Korean bbq everyone is so sweet and the food amazing  I'll always recommend this place over any other."}
{"text":"1st our server Kevin was AMAZING!  Polite, courteous and extremely likable from the moment our party of 5 walked in. The food equally amazing, flavorful and all around tasteful. Great place for family dinner or just to hang with friends."}
{"text":"I usually eat at an AYCE KKBQ place called Hwaro, but I thought I would give this place a try since it is close to home. My party of 4 tried the combo that served 3-4 people and we were disappointed. Portions were small, meat was well flavored but not enough for all of us. We each left hungry. And it was weird that the 'server' wouldn't let us cook our own meat. For $3 more at Hwaro and a 10 minute further drive, I can eat all the meat, desserts, appetizers, and rice I want."}
{"text":"Food & service was awesome! We were just driving around looking for a place to eat when the restaurant 'Moo Woo' stood out, so I yelped it. Next thing you know we're inside eating. We ordered a Moo Woo Combo and a bibimbap to share with 4 people. And it def could feed more than 4 that's for sure. I enjoyed the part where our server actually cooked everything for us! That's a plus! We were all ready to cook our own food, but that was a great surprise. Also, we checked in & got free facial masks + a water bottle thing that looked like it was for soju. Definite go to place when in Vegas / when in the area!"}
{"text":"I can't say that this is one of my favorite nor I dislike it either. It is one of those restaurant that we tried and it was ok but won't come back because there was nothing special about it. I love Korean BBQ don't get me wrong but we told the server that it was our first time and did not seem to personalize our experience nor offered anything in menu to try or anything that stands out in the menu or restaurant's famous dishes etc."}
{"text":"I am used to an eat-all-you can type Koran BBq but their combo was great. Amount of food was right, cooked by their servers and always came with a smile. You will I've this place"}
