{"text":"Really great for a late night, inexpensive snack! 1.99$ for a foot-long hot dog, and it was tasty too! :)"}
{"text":"Hot dogs are good all beef , the service not so much , unfriendly staff, they also upd the price from 1.99 to 2.49 .!"}
{"text":"As of June 16, 2016 a plain foot long hot dog cost $2.49 ($2.69 w/tax).  This is one of the best things I've eaten in Vegas.  Ketchup and mustard are free, but other toppings are extra.  Next time I will skip the buffet and come here.  The guy who works there is nice and quick too!"}
{"text":"$3 craps and $1.99 hot dog, nice way to spend a late Vegas night.  Located at the back of Casino Royal, this little gem serves up a bargain in New Vegas prices.  Great to put in the belly after a late night of Vegas."}
{"text":"$3 for a foot long hot dog The hot dog is longer then then my favorite Costco dog but thinner. It's not as meaty but for Vegas, this was a good price. The extra for the chili is not worth it.   Decor It's all the way in the back. Kinda sketchy looking.  Service Service was fine but they don't give out water.  Would I come here again? Yea. I'm poor."}
{"text":"What do you want from a foot long hot dog that costs $2?!? Decent taste for this skinny wiener. They actually make the meat look longer by putting it on a shorter bun. Good eats for low pricing, which is always a good thing in my book.  This place is located in the back of the Casino Royale. Walk through the drinking and smoking gamblers and get your grub.  If you are not eating inside the casino, you can ask for condiments to go, and they pack up your dogs really well in a plastic, clear bag for you.  if you do choose to dine in, you can have access to a fill it yourself drink service station, and many industrial size condiments.  If you are in Vegas, just stop and get one of these dogs to live in the time when Vegas kept multiple cheap eating spots to keep you happy, full and gambling!"}
{"text":"Can't expect much when you getting a plain hotdog for $2.49. I didn't know what to eat and wasn't too hungry. I was in Casino Royale already, so why not try this place out.   It actually wasn't too bad, the bread was fresh for the most part. Just too much bun for this skinny wiener. I ripped off a lot of the bread (low carb diet).  I guess I'll come again for a quick cheap meal if I don't know where else to go."}
{"text":"Can't beat the hotdog for the price. Our first meal in Vegas, because inn n out wasn't open yet. It was really good. Like a New York street dog, just bigger. The hotdog and a drink is all you need. No sides necessary. It's a novelty, give it a try."}
{"text":"It's weird, but you go out for the best dinner ever in Vegas and spend $200, then the next day when you realize you spent that much, you find yourself eating a $5 hot dog and it's the OTHER best meal you have had this trip.  Can't believe it? Try for yourself."}
{"text":"It was good! For a quick snack we went here, it was a little bit overpriced but we are speaking about Las Vegas. I got the banh mi, which has a lot of meat and a lot of flavor. Close enough to the traditional Vietnamese sandwich. They have Build-Your-Own salad, which is really cool."}
{"text":"I found Snack Nook a couple of years ago when staying at the Best Western which is above the food court of Casino Royale that hosts this tiny restaurant. It's claim to fame was a foot long hot dog for $1.99 which was like dirt cheap. I was skeptical but tried it one day and found it to be pretty decent. Not great, but still good for the price. They used to have a container with relish along with ketchup and mustard on the counter that you could help yourself to. I think year before last they got rid of the condiments but kept the price constant. However you could ask for relish and get a small container without charge. Towards the end of last year (2014) they raised the price to $2.49 which was still extremely cheap. I keep visiting for old times sake :)"}
{"text":"If you like Footlong dogs and CHEAP, this is the place to come and grab a quick snack :D   This is located in the little food court area of Casino Royale and was very convenient, close to Noble Pizza.  I ordered one footlong, and it only costs $2.49.  They have a seating area too.  It was a very good dog!  They have the basic relish, mustard, ketchup, onions, but if you want extras or cheese, there is an additional fee.  They don't give out cups of water, but you can buy a bottled water or other drinks available."}
