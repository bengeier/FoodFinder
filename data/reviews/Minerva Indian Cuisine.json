{"text":"My family and I ate at Minerva on Sunday, June 21 2015 as part of a Father's Day outing in Madison.  The restaurant came as a recommendation from a co-worker and it didn't disappoint.   We sampled three dishes, not including naan and rice:  Idli Vada, Chicken Madras, and Bhagara Baigan, none of which are typical Indian restaurant fare.  All choices were delicious but the Chicken Madras was outstanding.  I really appreciated the variety of dishes available, especially since I am not that familiar with Southern Indian cuisine. Price-wise, I thought dinner was a good value: Around $41 for all the food listed above plus 2 mango lassis.  I am very much looking forward to going for the lunch buffet, especially after reading previous reviews.  Overall:  5 stars for the food and 3.5 for ambiance.  It's location in a strip mall doesn't help but I think they could spruce things up and be attentive of piles of things strewn around.  This didn't really bother me but my family commented on it.  This, in no way, should detract you from visiting for lunch and dinner.  The food, like I said, was outstanding and a great addition to a great food town."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Madison including biryanis and curries. The spices are appropriate."}
{"text":"Now under new ownership, Minerva will be undergoing a name change in the near future. Great place for an Indian food buffet. Typical offerings of simple salad with Raita dressing, tamarind and mint chutney, along with classics like tandoori chicken, tikka masala, chicken biryani and saag paneer. There were at least six additional selections of vegetarian, chicken and lamb dishes, and two desserts not typically seen on Indian food buffets - a sweetened paneer/soft fresh cheese in rose flavored/ pistachio sauce and beet root pur√©e. Both were rich and satisfying and a nice alternative to kheer and mango ice cream. The food was fresh, even at 1:30, and kept hot in clean, covered serving dishes. Wonderful,  warm buttered naan was served at the table. You can make a meal out of this treat by dipping in the tasty chutneys. Very friendly staff, and a chef who seems to know how to do it right - spicy but not excessive. The meat in the curries was lean, moist and tender. The buffet selections change daily. I've been to many Indian food buffets in Madison and Milwaukee and this place is better than most."}
{"text":"I found out about this place from the owner of the indian grocery that I shop at. Went there for the lunch buffet on a weekday and for the price it was good. More meat options than vegetarian, but still enough vegetarian food to fill me up. The vegetarian options included Jerra Aloo, palak paneer, and a black channa. All tasty with the complimentary dosas.  Only reason why I didn't give it five stars was because they didn't have my favorite chutney and the buffet prices were a mystery until we paid. The layout is L shaped and a little awkward but the people are friendly and the food was good. We will most likely go back in a few months."}
{"text":"Vegan choices abound!  This is my favorite restaurant in the Madison area - Indian or otherwise.  The food is excellent.  I have very strict diet (vegan, very low/no oil, gluten free, nightshade free) and they accommodate!  The menu is extensive with several meals and appetizers that can be adjusted for me.  My favorites include hot and sour soup, pappadon (thin cracker), dosas, uthappam, and gobi - manchurian and pepper salt.  I'm really looking forward to trying Amber, their new restaurant, that is opening the end of 2015 or beginning of 2016, in the Willy West shopping center."}
{"text":"I was staying in the area for a business trip and was delighted to stop by this restaurant which had vegetarian options that I could enjoy :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant last sunday for the first time and we tried the buffet and since we started to eat we noticed the difference between the other indian restaurants we have been to and this one and Minerva it's so much better! Every single thing we tried was sooo tasty, my favorites were: the chili chicken, the channa masala (garbanzo beans in a creamy sauce) the deep fried vegetables ( they were sooo crispy) and their cottage cheese, it was sooo delicate I did not want to finish eating it, we would definitely come back for more! The only reason I gave them 4 stars its because the buffet area it is so small and I think they should rearrange it, they have the main entrees in the narrower side where most of the people stand most of the time, they should put them in the beginning area, where everybody start to get their empty plates since it is a more open area."}
{"text":"Minera is one of the lousiest Indian eatery places in Madison. Service sucks. There is NOT even a single good thing about this restaurant. The owner has NO idea about how to run a restaurant business 1.       In the era of technological advancement and social networking, the business does NOT have a running website.  2.       Lunch buffet is a 'copycat' of another restaurant in town: Minerva tried to even place the same items in the same location as the other one_they don't have any originality ! And surprisingly they have the same items even: can't they have something different of their own !  3.       Standard of lunch buffet is nothing great. Even food quality of dinner is nothing to die for.  4.       Tables are too small and cramped up:  a 4-person table is ideally suited for 2 persons.  5.       The restaurant is very small and cramped up ! When people line up for the buffet, it is a complete chaos.  6.       For dinner, the 2-person tables do not even have a table cloth !  7.       Wait staff sucks_they don't have any idea of what they are doing.  8.       In dinner_there is NO control of the ordering status: the wait staff has no idea whose order is what_and when the food comes out_the staff does not does not know in which table to bring the food ! It's a big CHAOS.  9.       Amongst this, the turnover time for the food to come out after order is placed is rather quick, which is appreciated !.  10.    We tried certain Dosas, the south Indian delicacy in which the restaurant specializes in ! The dosas came without the sides (sambar, chutney !) had to ask for the same: which is ridiculous ! The Sambar, chutney was stale and had no great taste. Sambar felt like having grains of sand in it.  11.   The other families who were dining with us in other tables were equally unhappy with the service.  12.   We ordered a Rava Masala Dosa_they messed up and an Onion Rava Dosa came out. When we mentioned that the ordered was messed, they took it back inside the kitchen_and put the masala in a small bowl and brought it back out ! That was terrible !  13.   Appetizers are served in small side dishes of Corelle brand ! The restaurant even does not have proper serving bowls. They purchased cheap dishes for serving food.  14.   This is a substandard restaurant. They have made the menu items very attractive encompassing all different platter_but that has back-fired on them. Nothing is turning out great. Had they emphasized on their strength and specialized on South Indian platter, they would done a better job."}
{"text":"Incredibly diverse menu and one of the few places in Madison that serves Dosa.  We had the Ghee Dosa which was absolutely delicious - it stretched across the width of the table and we devoured every last bit.  We were with friends who had just been in India and suggested we try the \"Fish Moilee\" from the Malabar Cuisine section.  The fish was tender and the sauce it came in, a tomato and coconut based curry was aromatic and perfect with a bit of paratha or on rice.  We also had the \"Malai Kofta\" which tied with the fish as my favorite dish of the night.  We were all using our last pieces of garlic naan to sop up every last bit of the sauce.    Finally, we also had the Pongal which was fragrant, spiced perfectly (we asked for mild to be safe and it had just a bit of spice) and a great accompaniment to everything else.  The menu is huge so be ready for that, but also be open to trying new items.  I had only ever had a different kofta dish before and a different dosa so I was so happy that we branched out from our usual tikka masala ordering."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst and sad restaurant in Madison. Pathetic service. The manager or someone of that restaurant is so irresponsible of what's going on in the restaurant. The food is not at all freshly made..it's very oily and rotten! I would never ever go to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite indian restaurant in town!  They have a very extensive menu for dinner.  We ordered the Dum Chicken Biriyani, Bhagara Baigan, and Punu Gulu.  It was amazing!  Everyone was incredibly nice as well.  I'm excited to try their lunch buffet and all the items on the menu that I have never seen before!"}
{"text":"Finally Madison has an authentic South Indian restaurant. I may be biased, but south Indian food is way more awesome than the typical north Indian food you get at most other Indian restaurants. Their dosas are to die for - crispy and yummy and there are so many kinds of them. Their kothu parotta (savory minced bread) is absolutely authentic and delicious and my favorite item on the menu. This is a street food that is popular in Tamil Nadu and this is the first time I am seeing this on a menu in the US. And their Indo-Chinese dishes are tasty too. Do yourself a favor and try some new Indian dishes at Minerva"}
{"text":"Simply the best South Indian food in Madison so far. Their pongal vada is to absolutely die for! Just the right amount of dal, ghee and cashews :) And their dosas - wow, they have over a dozen varieties - all scrumptious. I also like their Madurai idli - spiced and fried goodness. Their sambhar and coconut chutney is also good.   Not really a fan of most of their other dishes though. I prefer the other Indian restaurants in town for North Indian food. So, this is quite complementary since I don't really like the others' South Indian fare!  Their service is decent and the owners are nice. Not giving 5 because their quantity to price ratio is a bit low - understandable for an upstart, but hopefully they will fix it in due course."}
{"text":"My friends and I enjoy going to this restaurant because of the authentic South Indian food. However, in the past two visits, we have always been rushed by the same waiter. While we were still ordering the main course, he wanted to know what we would like for dessert! There was still two hours left for the restaurant to close! Next time we went, he took away our plates while we were still eating. Before I could tell him to leave the plates, he disappeared into the kitchen...What's the hurry!?  Food is great, but we have been disappointed with the service repeatedly. I won't be recommending this restaurant to my friends, or visiting it again soon."}
{"text":"Minerva had a change of ownership within the last year, the prior owner has opened Amber (on University Ave) and apparently took all of the authentic flavors and quality with him.  If you want good quality Indian in Madison, Amber is the far better choice."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am vegetarian so i haven't tried chicken or lamb entrees.   I have been to buffet more than 20 times, ordered for take out many times.   I have been to all parts of india, been to some of the best restaurants in all major cities. Minerva's food taste is closest to authentic indian food compared to other restaurants in madison.   Buffet is not that exceptional but if you order individual dishes the must try things are  - Veg biryani - kutthu paratha - various south indian dishes  Food quality is incredible.   South indian entrees and few north indian entrees are very good. Not all north indian entrees are good.   Taste of Indo chinese entrees and starters has deteriorated in last few months.   Pros - great food - authentic taste, spicy - unique menu : menu has various things that other indian restaurants do not have - friendly staff  Cons - limited space ( i have heard they are moving to bigger place ) - mediocre ambience"}
{"text":"At last! Madison has a place that serves proper \"Dum Biriyani\". All the other Indian restaurants in Madison serve some sort of weird amalgam of Pulao and Chicken Fried rice but this is the real deal. Try it out if you have never done so before!  Another thing I liked about this place was their menu, it was really broad and covered multiple sub types of Indian cuisine - mainly Northern, Chinese(Yes!) & Southern. I haven't had to try the Northern or the Chinese but if the food I had was anything to go by it should all be good.  I tried out the Chicken Dum Biriyani & Chettinadu and both were awesome. The Chettinadu was a bit too spicy for my palate (and I like spicy food and have higher threshold than most) but Biriyani more than made-up for it."}
{"text":"Ordered the chaat items. Have had much better. The green chutney they add to chaat is the idli chuney. Not meant for authentic chaat. Havent tasted anything else, so cant comment."}
{"text":"We used this place to feed a large group of people for an event after doing some calling around for price comparisons, this place was the best deal and willing to work with us, we picked up the food and it was excellent."}
{"text":"I order Goat and Chicken Biryani whenever i do. It tastes good and its authentic Dum biryani. South Indian Cuisine in the MENU tastes the best in Madison."}
{"text":"I LOVE Indian food and am quite picky about it. There are very few tremendous Indian restaurants in Madison. This is the top! The spice and flavor was delicious and the gulab jamun was so phenom so make sure you save room!"}
{"text":"I generally do not like buffets at Indian restaurants either because of the options available or because the quality is not good enough. The buffet at Minerva surprised me. It was actually very good. Some of the things you can look forward to :  Malai kofta - was very creamy.  Mango ice cream - tastier than usual Garlic naan - was soft  Paneer tikka - max masala but tasty  Something to note : the menu has a lot of options."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Indian restaurant in Madison"}
{"text":"Worst place! I ordered food two days ago and my daughter vomited. Please don't go there."}
{"text":"5 star for food -  3 star for ambience  Best south Indian restaurant in Midwest far i tried biryani, noodles, paneer 65, veg manchuria, dosa, idly etc., none of them have disappointed us so far. Their food is an authentic Indian food. All other indian food  places modified for non indians. But here you'll get 100% indian food. Wish the place was a little bit bigger and have good ambience. No other restaurant in Madison can beat minerva for south Indian food."}
{"text":"Authentic south Indian restaurant (Tamil style cooking).. Had lunch buffet here, loved starters both veg and non veg... Chicken 65, tandoori, pakoda, curd rice, dosa are delicious...."}
{"text":"5 of us had a very nice dinner at Minerva on a busy Saturday night. We had recently read the review in the Isthmus and decided to give the restaurant a try. Indian food is one of our favorites. Took about 10 minutes to get us seated and menus were handed to us promptly.   For the next 10 to 15 minutes we went over the hundred ninety three items on the menu. Each of us had a favorite item in mind even before we sat down. Our waiter was an authentic Indian who knew the food very well. Unfortunately it was difficult to understand exactly all of his comments but his enthusiasm and humor overcame any of those shortcomings. We loved the experience and would like to go back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Indian food is spreading like wildfire, of late. For me, that's a darn good thing. Last night's food was right on the top of the list along with Dhaba.   My sweet Pakistani beau showed up at my house with takeout. I was cold and tired from walking outside getting ready for a 5k. Putting me and 5k in the same sentence is crazy. Anyway, the food from Minerva was just what the doctor ordered. We ate the Hyderabadi Dum Chicken Biriyani and the Fish Curry.  I loved both dishes equally. The heat level was \"medium\" which for me was perfect. The rice in the biryani was lovely and perfectly prepared. Each grain stood alone. The chicken was on the bone, tender and plentiful. The fish was excellent, not overcooked and really enhanced by the curry sauce.   We had both plain and garlic naan. They were fluffy and tender even after reheating. We dipped the bread in the curry sauce not leaving behind even one drop.   The servings sizes were generous and today I revisited the biriyani for lunch. Glad I didn't have to share that last portion."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy lunch buffet! And a great value at $8.95.   There's about 4 large buffet carts set up in the corner of the restaurant, and they offer a large variety of Indian offerings. I think I tried just about everything and couldn't find one I didn't enjoy! Their Chicken Tikka Masala is so amazing...I probably could've had 4 plates of just that and been happy. I also loved their Chicken 65. I've never had anything like it before and it was delish. They also offer garlic and plain naan, as well as a sampling of many different chutneys and sauces.   Wasn't too busy when I was there, I was one of about 5 people dining in. But the server was constantly taking plates and refilling water glasses!   I think I can say that I've had better Indian food, but this place offers an awesome lunch buffet that I will definitely be back to enjoy again!"}
{"text":"I've been trying out all of the Indian restaurants in Madison and the surrounding areas and stopped in for the lunch buffet at Minerva after reading the other reviews on this site. I was extremely disappointed. I arrived around 1:30-- the lunch buffet goes until 2:30-- and everything I tried was cold and looked picked-over. There was just a small amount of each of the vegetarian dishes left so I tried a little bit of all of them. The food tasted fine, but I've definitely had much better Indian food. I was hoping they might bring out some more food that would be hot, but the only food they brought out while I was there was rice. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Place could be better, it's okay. Food wasn't great. The chaat that I ordered was cold. It shouldn't have been. I know that because I am an Indian. I only had north indian food so I can't comment about the south indian food available there. The plus side was that their menu had a lot of variety."}
{"text":"Yet another excellent meal. Even the standards like the vindaloo and tikka marsalas and especially the garlic naan is just fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ate there tonight and found it to be the best Indian food in the Madison area. The website stated it is under new ownership, so I was a little apprehensive but all of the food was outstanding. I went with an Indian friend and she agreed with the quality of the food. Highly recommended and I would definitely go back. We ordered off the menu,  so I can't speak to the quality of the buffet."}
{"text":"Small venue, but an extensive south Indian menu with fair prices.   We made dinner reservations for a large group, and they were very accommodating. Service can be a bit slow but a little pro-activeness will ensure your needs are met.    Their idlis and vadas were soft and well textured, a typical starch, so bland in flavor. The sambar (lentil soup) was a welcome accompaniment. Their dosas are also a nice addition -- they have the crispy crepe formula down --  if a little lacking in stuffing.   I will be back and would recommend Minerva to fans of Indian cuisine looking to sample a more southern-inspired menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Minerva for the first time today.  The food was outstanding.  As often as we eat Indian cuisine, I am not good at describing most dishes by name.  What I can tell you is that the selections on the buffet were fresh, hot and deliciously seasoned.   Plus, there were several offerings on the buffet that I've never tried elsewhere.  It was nice to try something new.   The tandoori chicken was especially moist and meaty, not at all dry.   The spices in every dish were just right.   The only thing I found missing from the condiment section was the salty mixed relish that I enjoy on the side.    This is a smaller-sized restaurant, and it was nice not to have to stand in a line to fill my plate.  Despite the smaller dining room, the size of the buffet and number of dishes offered was equivalent to both the larger Indian buffets we frequent.   If you are a fan of Indian buffets, you will be very pleased by the quality and selection!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome Biryani!! The best in Madison. We also love the different variety of dosa. My personal favorite- egg dosa!!! So yummy. Every time I crave Indian, Minerva is our go to place!!! The service is a little slow though... Just have to have some patience!!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is delicious! Its a small dining room, but definitely the best Indian place I've been to in Madison.  Probably one of my favorite place sin Madison so far."}
{"text":"I'm hooked on the lunch buffet. They have a good variety and serve some different items than the other Indian buffets I've been to while still remaining familiar. The two things that enamor me to Minerva over the other nearby Indian buffets is that they allow the lunch buffet to be carried out in a to-go box and cup and it's slightly cheaper while being of the same or better quality. The only downside to this place is there isn't much seating."}
{"text":"Big fan of Minerva. Excellent food, staff, and well worth the trip. Recently moved to the Madison area from the west coast and can't get enough Minerva. Have been there twice and left fat and happy both times. My wife had the butter chicken, both times, and I have tried whatever the owner tells me I'm having. And he hasn't let me down yet. I get a 7 for spicy and it's just right. Next time a 8, my wife gets a 5 and says just right. But I like a spicy, \"employee only spicy\" and Minerva delivers!"}
{"text":"5-Star because it is the only restaurant that offers really South Indian food in Madison. It adds much diversity to Madison's food scene.   We tried Dosa and Uttapam. They are REAL!! Get a Ghee dosa. It would be both a month-opening and eye-opening experience if you have never tried it before.   Fish curry was a very memorable dish. We also tried things under the \"Chettinadu\" category. Good stuff.   They have a incredibly long menu. It will take maybe 10 visits to savor the full selection. For first few visits, I suggest sticking to things you can't find in other Indian places in Madtown.   Based on our two dinner visits, both food and service is pretty good. I hope this new establishment on the west side will thrive in the coming years.   CAUTION: The \"Hyderabadi Dum Chicken Biriyani\" is insanely spicy. I like spicy food in general and take on very spicy dishes. But this dish will be over the limit to most people. Consult before you order."}
{"text":"I was here last February and had the most bizarre dining experience at this place. My partner and I ordered gobi manchurian, masala dosa, avial, and chai to have before the meal. The gobi manchurian arrived and was great, however our chai did not arrive before that. The masala dosa arrived flat, flavorless, and anything but crispy. They completely forgot about the avial, and the chai came with our check. The result is that my partner never got their entree and mine was a completely miserable dosa. Definitely would not recommend this place. For dosa Maharani downtown has been the best thus far. Although Minerva has good gobi manchurian, the offering at Swagat is much better. This place pales in comparison to Udupi and Mysore Woodland in Chicago."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting the Indian Buffet seen in Madison for the past 15 years, and Minerva blows everything out of the water.  Every dish is uniquely flavored and is actually spicy!  The Dosas brought to your table are a nice touch as well.  I am so excited to have found this place, I'm glad I don't live closer to it, as I'd be putting on some major weight.  Thanks Minerva, keep the buffet as it is now, and I'm confident that you will develop and maintain a strong  and supportive customer base.  I've seen so many places in town that started strong and eventually cut corners (ingredients, spice, heat level, variety, etc.), really losing their touch, and eventually closing down."}
{"text":"I probably will not end up back here anytime soon. The food itself was very unique in the way it tastes/seasoned. Some of the dishes were quite spicy for general buffet options but I don't knock it for that. Some other broken english 1 star review/1 user review only exists for this which honestly screams a review by a competing restaurant yet I agree with a bit. The largest problem is the space, space and service. Our server(not sure if we had one assigned) seemed new or nervous and spilled water all over. After changing seats, we were more or less ignored beyond our initial drink. There was little communication as to who our actual server was and wasn't even sure where to get the bill. After a while of being ignored, we just walked up and got it. But lets face the ultimate problem - the space. It is like Taqueria Guadalajara seating combined with a buffet table set in a strange corner/alcove. The buffet table itself even borders tables where you MAY be seated. Do you like having people constantly standing right by you grabbing food or lining up? The strangest thing is when you get to the end of the buffet line, it's a dead end and you have to like walk awkwardly around people to try to get out... It seems nonsensical. And like another review said -when there is a lot of people waiting to be seated the place has a very strange limbo zone by the door where you can't really get in or heck - even goto the bathrooms from the dining area. I just don't think the space itself is suitable for an Indian buffet. Buffets need a lot of spacing for the constant amount of people getting up, lining up and returning to their seats as well as a logical flow and layout for the buffet plates. Instead it is a dead end with seating similar to a High School Cafeteria..be prepared to sit next to strangers..."}
{"text":"Pretty good indian food. I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious. It's a small place but we will certainly go back ."}
{"text":"I really want to like Minerva like many of my family members who have not had experiences similar to ours while there. The food is pretty good compared to the other Indian restaurants in town. My favorites are Haveli and Swad.   To give them a fair chance, my spouse and I have been to Minerva three times for the lunch buffet on the weekday and weekend at least an hour to an hour and a half before the buffet was to close. Each of those times, we did not feel particularly welcome or that our business was appreciated. Frankly, we felt like we were imposing.  I thought it was me and did not say anything until my wife made the comment after we had left the first time. Our next two visits were the same.  On all of our visits, our table was cleared reasonably promptly so there's no issue there. It has always been upon entering and exiting that we get these blank stares with barely an acknowledgment.  I have not heard this from other people so suspect it could just be us although I am not sure why since we are pretty affable and well mannered.  A simple hello, thank you and a smile or nod would suffice.    Their buffet selection is on the small side and is just OK quality and taste wise.  The space is a little cramped.  If there were any more than a few other tables of people, a wheelchair bound guest could not be accommodated readily. All told, there are more comfortable and welcoming settings with better food.    But for the lack of pleasantness and difficulty accommodating our more physically challenged brothers and sisters, I would give them 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"This place is must if you enjoy South Indian food! The service is nothing spectacular, but the food is well worth it and because of that, I'm able to overlook the service. This isn't to say service was bad, it just didn't go above and beyond my expectations. The menu is extensive with a lot of options--everything from your traditional curries to some more adventurous fare. My curry and naan was fresh, delicious, and perfect in every way."}
{"text":"Went on opening weekend. They opened up two days previously. (They don't even have their liquor license yet - the waiter said would be through in a week.)   The staff was very nice and the food was really delicious. The paneer was some of the best I've ever hard. I don't know if this will be their permanent model but it was all buffet, no menus.   The only particularly negative thing is that the floor was really dirty...to the point of it being very noticeable and odd.   I would also suggest they would mark veg or non-veg on the buffet - it was kind of hard to guess.   All this said, we will definitely go back - maybe in a month or so when they've got beer. :)"}
{"text":"We tried 4 different dishes (2 apps and 2 entrees) and every single one was delish! We're definitely going back soon.  This is a no frills kind of place. So don't expect the most meticulous dinner service. Go there for the amazing food :)"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet had a great variety! A highlight was the Bindi Masala okra dish... delicious and unique, definitely recommend! Go here and try a little of everything to find your favorite Indian dish."}
{"text":"A little out of the way in a strip mall, but Minerva has really good food.  In particular, they had an Indo-Chinese type chicken (chicken 65 maybe?  The name is escaping me.) on the buffet line that was really enjoyable.  The buffet selection is a little on the small side, but it's all well done and tasty.  Also a little bit on the expensive side for the lunch buffet.  I agree with some of the comments here that sometimes it feels a little bit like you're imposing when you come in the door and that the staff is a little...tentative?  Is that the word?  I dunno.  Enjoyable place, will definitely come back from time to time, but it's not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Four star food, two star experience.  So the food is delicious, and the wait was not long. Host/ owner was very friendly and talked with me while I waited for my chicken curry. The chicken in my chicken curry was moist and spicy. Rice was cooked well. The bad aspect of my meal was how the ingredients were misrepresented.  I asked what dish didn't have dairy, and I was told to get the chicken curry. Definitely my fault for not double checking the ingredients, but I assumed the owner knew best. Absolutely amazing curry, but gave me the worst stomach pain after. I almost had to call in sick to work the next day. I do not think the owner had ill intent, but I think he just pulled a suggestion from the menu and claimed it was dairy free.  Previous reviews are correct: this food is great, and the spices are so delicious. But my goal is to find and review dairy free food, and I was misled to think this place had dairy free chicken curry. I will return, but next time I WILL be skeptical and not take any suggestions (and probably read every ingredient on the menu)"}
{"text":"Ridiculously good! Quaint! Cozy!  Lost one star only because - Lil Lacking in True Indian Atmosphere.  - Food is teriffic!! That's what matters!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the lunch buffet the couple of times that I have been here.  I am not familiar with the names of many of the dishes but I know that I really loved the flavors of many of the dishes.  They have fantastic rice and lots of meat options.  I am a big goat fan (no judgement please) and I want to say it's among the best that I have had in the city.     The service in this place is also standout!  The few times I have been here the staff have been extremely accommodating and ultra pleasant.  I am happy that this place has opened up so close to my office as I foresee many visits in my future."}
{"text":"Oh, no -- I hate to downgrade these guys because the staff is so friendly, it's a clean place and they work hard and do so much the right way. However, there are other Indian places that sell my favorite dish for about the same price, but use tender chunks of white meat chicken. My vindaloo here had what I assume is dark meat, with what many of what I consider to be inedible pieces (tough, grisly, veiny, fatty). I'm not going to rule out returning here, but if the price of an entree is going to be comparable to the competition, I would suggest to match their quality as well. For the aforementioned reasons, I wish these guys the best and I will be back. I hope my suggestion helps."}
{"text":"Since they just opened a week or two ago I'll have to update this review after I try the dinner.  Lunch buffet was good but unfortunately at a buffet most places tone down the spice level (which may be a plus for most people!).    Given that this place is 2 minutes away from Swagat (my go-to Indian buffet!) and 4 minutes away from Dhaba (not a buffet, but pretty good!) I think they have some stiff competition.  However, the dinner menu (online) has a pretty wide variety of dishes that I don't think you'll find at the other places, so I'm looking forward to trying that.  Oh, and for my 6 year old they have chicken nuggets on the menu (cause he ain't fooled by chicken pakora...)  Service was nice and friendly-- they kept coming around with dosas, which was nice.  Kinda a weird/cramped layout with the seating (the place almost seems too small for a buffet!)  All in all, if you like Indian food I'd recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I am going to come right out and admit that I'm not an expert on Indian food.  I infrequently visit Indian restaurants and the totality of my Indian cooking experience is baking a couple batches of naan bread and cobbling together a presentable chicken tikka marsla.  So if you are looking for the definitive review on the authenticity of the cuisine served at Minerva, this is not that review.  With that said, I felt my lunch buffet experience was A-OK.  I thought the quality of the food was above average by buffet standards.  The staff members were hard working and extremely cordial.  Things I liked: * The $9.95 lunch buffet offers an abundance of options.  It took three trips to the buffet to sample everything (including the desserts).  The lamb curry, the chicken tikka marsala and Aloo Gobi were standouts for me. * The staff was constantly replenishing the buffet trays, so the food in the buffet stayed fresh.  (It helped that the restaurant was at capacity for lunch service.) * LOVED the caramel custard dessert - that dish alone has me jonesing for a return visit * There always was a staff member near to the buffet to answer questions and to offer suggestions for dishes to try.  The servers were extremely diligent about keeping beverage glasses filled and clearing dirty dishes.  Things I didn't: * The naan bread was a let down - it was too dry for my liking.  I also did not care for the watered down coconut soup. * The Spartan interior of the restaurant is nothing to write home about.  As Corey D mentioned in his review, it definitely will not transport you across the ocean to India.  In addition, the buffet is wedged into an alcove and it was difficult to maneuver through the other diners.   * Sitting near the front door during polar vortex season subjects you a cold breeze every time someone walks through the front door. * For a cuisine known for its extensive use of spices, I thought the buffet food was timidly seasoned.   * It can be hard to understand the servers  Other observations and ramblings: * There was a line to get a table by 12:15, so come early to hit up the buffet. * Why is an Indian restaurant named after the Roman goddess of wisdom?  Is it just me that wonders about things like that?"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim, Tuesday night. Staff was very attentive and service was prompt and courteous. My wife ordered a curry mango chicken dish which was great. I ordered a lamb dish with basmati rice also great. The only thing I could point out was the glass of wine I had, came from the right bottle but can tell it had oxidized for more days than necessary, that said, if I truly were looking  for fresh wine ordering a bottle is the way to go."}
{"text":"Heck yeah! Talk about the system working! Props to Matt who started the awesome thread on Yelp Madison Talk re: openings and closings (http://www.yelp.com/topic/madison-the-official-2013-madison-openings-and-closings-comings-and-goings-thread) and thanks to Steve for letting the community know about this new Indian joint on Junction Rd. (It may have taken me a few months to get her otherwise!) I was bouncing around the threads last night, saw \"Indian\" and got in the car. (I called on my way to make sure they were actually open.)  Folks, this is easily the best Indian food I've found in Madison for three reasons:  1. The Menu... holy cow, IT'S HUGE! I went for dinner and spent forever pouring over each and every page, looking up a few items on my phone because they were new to me. No shortage of variety here.     2. The Dosas... this and this alone should make you speed over. I think they have 15! That's nuts... NUTS! I'm used to seeing maybe 3 or 4 different kinds at a place.  3. The Flavor... everything I tried was incredible. And although spice/heat is key to Indian cooking, theirs is well balanced, and not so hot that you can't taste anything.   I had vegetable jalfrezi, chicken tikka masala, masala dosa and garlic naan. All of it was awesome! (GET THESE THINGS!) Even the garlic naan, which I sort of feel like is tough to make incredible, but it was incredible. It arrived at the table piping hot and aromatic and didn't have an offensive garlic flavor. The chicken tikka masala was some of the best I've had, topping some of the curry I long for in London. The veggies were tender yet crisp and in a super tasty sauce. And the dosa. Ohhhh the dosa. It was good, not my favorite, but with so many options, I can't wait to get back and try another one... maybe more adventurous than this one.   Huge props to the stellar staff that made sure we had no questions about the menu, kept water glasses full, and told us they will have beer/wine/liquor soon. (Just wrapping up some paperwork.) They also sent us home with leftovers in boxes and gave us extra rice. Very kind.   The atmosphere ain't much, so don't go expecting to be transported to India or anything. There is some nice stuff hand painted on one wall, but that's about it. Small space. Bright light. No tunes playing the night I was there. I didn't notice construction dirt or dust so I'm guessing they cleaned up after what sounds like a rushed opening. And my feeling has always been, if I'm there the first week, I'm going to make a few exceptions anyway knowing they're still trying to find their footing. These guys have though. And if food remains consistent, this will be my go to for Indian stuffs in Madison!"}
{"text":"Excellent curry, quality of meat was a bit below average (dark meat chicken pieces, somewhat gristly).  Slow service as well, and restaurant seemed a bit dirty.  Upgrade the quality of the meat and clean the bathrooms and tablecloths (the restaurant was NOT clean - somewhat worrisome), and this would be a winner."}
{"text":"This humble little Indian buffet is so tasty! They prepare all their food fresh from scratch (I asked!). No pre-packaged or reheated foods. The selection is enough to make 2 or 3 rounds with many things on your plate and still not get the same thing twice. My buddy and I agreed that it was our new favorite place."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. Dosa and vada were so oily. The Pongal and veg manchurian tasted fine. We did get the biryani to go after reading the reviews. Hopefully it tastes as good as it smells."}
{"text":"I always order only one item from their menu, Chicken dum biryani and it is top notch."}
{"text":"Minerva has the worst service I have seen in a restaurant. These guys really need training in treatment of others."}
{"text":"I tried their lunch buffet for the first time today and really enjoyed the food.  There was a huge selection of different dishes with a variety of flavors and spiciness.  The services was very good.   It is smaller, but that makes it quieter and nicer for business or social conversations.  I have tried a few Indian lunch buffets in Madison and this is now one of my favorites."}
{"text":"The most authentic South Indian food in town. Very reasonable prices and convenient location. The lunch buffet also has a lot of variety. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"3 star for food and 0 star for cleanliness. Not consistence with quality of food, not at all a good place to dine in and if you are ordering for take out then please make sure to call 45 minutes before and if you are lucky enough then only your order will be ready on time, if you have catering order then be ready to pick it up because you might get call 10 minutes prior to your scheduled delivery time saying that they can't deliver due to blah...blah issues. Make sure to double check everything before you pick it up, chances of error is only 99%."}
