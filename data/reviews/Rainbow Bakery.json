{"text":"Been going here on and off for years move is why not constant foods delish spanish rice and beans  and  many others ive also eaten but cant spell"}
{"text":"There are alot of these bodega style store/restaurants in columbus catering to a more Mexican style of cusine. But you have to go back home to Lorain to get the real deal. Several times a day fresh Puerto Rican food. Quick, easy, and affordable. 

I have been going to rainbows for more than a decade and except for a couple of places I found in Florida, these dishes represent the most consistently flavorful examples of that mild hispanic food that I grew up eating."}
{"text":"The most unique grocery store anywhere.  It's like walking back in time.  Full service meat counter with the freshest meat and best prices.  Need help?  The staff go out of their way to assist.  I wish I could give it 10 stars."}
{"text":"Do not be intimidated by the bars on the windows...go inside!  You will find a delicious variety of homemade Puerto Rican food.  The prices can't be beat!  Do yourself a favor and try it all.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of my least favorite places is the Tampa Bay area. Friends of mine insist on  buying second homes there from the huge depreciation of condos or actually have the spite to retire there. Thus I find myself frequenting the Bay area as if I enjoy it. Since there are immigrant groups who have preferred settling there than in northern Ohio, I at least can sample Peruvian chicken, Hawaiian plate lunches, Colombian dinners or Cuban fare.

Once I discovered the many Cuban eateries I grew to enjoy my visits a great deal more. Cleveland lacks Cuban but Puerto Rican food shares many techniques and ingredients. Nary a month goes by I am not at one of the widely scattered PR restaurants in NE Ohio. Today I tried the Rainbow Bakery. It is one of those places where I think my GPS is nuts. Turn left in .5 miles then a sharp right then a left, make a U................

It was one of our typical sunny February days in the 50s.  I was glad to pull into a parking space and see a rather large outdoor eating area. Of course to the Puerto Rican customers the day was no where near as balmy. No one was outside.  Once I walked in I had one of those oh dear what a mistake this is moments. 

It is more of a convenience store offering a small selection of untempting bakery and a very meager offering of hot foods. Never one to admit my own failure I stood at the counter. On a board were written three dinners and instructions forbidding additions of sides or the use of food stamps. Other signs were taped to the glass, which Moses would have loved, informing customers what else is outlawed. 

I got a large order of beef stew over rice and beans as well as some type of soup which the server could not translate well enough for me to know what it is.  I waited till I got home expecting to tell myself good for you guy you tried it now delete it from the GPS. I was so wrong and the other reviews so right. I was given enough food for a couple and one child. And no matter how much you may like your own stew you ain't tasted nothing till you had this one.  Just tender beef in a thick flavorful sauce with a few chunks of potato. The rice and beans made me pity Symon's rosemary french fries or those fried in duck fat.  So dull, doncha  know.

I can add one more PR eatery to my short but wonderful list."}
{"text":"Psst... You do not need to go here.  You have no need for the best Puerto Rican food that is not in NYC or Chicago.  You don't need to know that this is the best place for rice and beans.  They don't have food like Taquitos, Alcapurrias, Chicharron, and Bu√±uelo made fresh everyday from scratch.   Let the fact that the store is a little dumpy on the inside, make you scared to go.   The baked goods are also not great, and pastries not yummy.   I would not recommend this place...
So all of its goodness, is all for me!  (This is the best representation of ethnic food I have had in the CLE)  This is just one of those places you are scared to tell people about, in hopes it stays a secret, but I can't help it... I yelp it."}
{"text":"Back in 1994 I went to Summer School at Lorain High.  I would frequent this place.   it's a diamond in the ruff.  Everything is Fresh, Hot, and delish.  I have been to Puerto Rico a few times and know my \"Rican Food\" and this is it baby!


Rice and beans some Alcapurrias, and fresh bread.  Si Amigo 

Rainbow Bakery saved my life, well picture a blonde girl in a plaid skirt w/ penny loafers.  Yep that be me, I was perceived as being square.   Let's just say I had no fighting skills, brass knuckles or razor blades in my coach bag.  But I did have a car and a pocket full of cash.  This is when I met Miss Kiesha.  Now let me tell you about my new found friend.   Our Math teacher Mr. Doinker was terrified of her.  The whole School was in check when Ki Ki walked in.  Girl was like a dude.   Anywho to get to my point I would give Kiesha a ride home from time to time and buy her lunch here.  

Let's just say I was a made girl.  Never had any issues I just had to keep my girl's belly full once in awhile 

Bueno"}
{"text":"Not the cleanest place in the world. But the food is amazing. Great prices large portions.  You are missing out you have never been here."}
{"text":"This is a local store/restaurant the food isn't quite authentic but it will do in a pinch. Definitely not like mom as cooking. Wide array of Hispanic  roots and vegetables."}
{"text":"Pastalillo potato balls rice & beans, all is excellent at a great price. Prices can't be beat either. Little hot sauce is great but not needed."}
{"text":"They sell some produce for really cheap. Already peeled garlic for a dollar and onions for around the same price. Thick pieces of garlic bread 50 cents. Fresh Spanish food is also sold here. Love this little store filled with great finds."}
