{"text":"I was really surprised to see the negative reviews here, because I thought M. Burrito's food was excellent. Some of the best Mexican food I've had in Montreal, and comparable to a few great Mexican meals I just had on the US west coast.  My chicken burrito was delicious, with fresh, moist chicken, green peppers, onions, and refried beans. Such a great depth of flavour. It's not the overstuffed Mission-style burrito typically found in Montreal, but a more traditional northern Mexican one, so maybe that's why some weren't into it. My gf was just as impressed with her vegetarian burrito. And we were given some chips and delicious salsa by the friendly women working there while we waited for our takeout order, which was a nice touch.   We both loved this place and can't wait to frequent it in the future."}
{"text":"Worse service - asked for ketchup twice and had to ask for fork and knifes The margarita basically had no liquor Never want to return again"}
{"text":"Bel endroit spacieux sans prétention sur av. Mont-royal  nous avons été attiré par l'offre tacos a volonté pour 15 $ pour 1 personne accompagné de 2 verres au choix. J'ai également gouté la sopa azteca qui  très bonne comme entrée totalement satisfaite . La portions de viandes dans les tacos est très généreuse et pour 15 $ il n'y as pas bcp d'endroit qui revienne moins cher. Tacos al pastor goutteux mais pas les meilleur que j'ai manger. Le problème ici est plus au niveaux du service la serveuse était très gentille mais visiblement débordé un employé de plus que ce ne soit que pour débarasser les tables, les nettoyer et remplir les verres d'eau n'aurait pas été du luxe. Du potentiel mais besoin de plus de staff ou une meilleur organisation. Tenterais sûrement une autre viste car le prix vaut la peine et la nourriture était bonne."}
{"text":"In all good faith I wish this were at last the good and inexpensive Mexican restaurant we are still missing in the neighborhood. Granted, we have good taquerias (e.g. Maïs, la Matraca) but I'm looking for a broader menu at a reasonable price. Although this place is spacious, looks clean, and had nice and efficient staff, the food is disappointing. Not bad, but kind of bland, with the exception of the mole sauce, which was flavorful. Even the nachos were quite boring compared to those I had in most non-Mexican restaurants. Overall, it was not a bad experience, but I am sorry to say it is nothing extraordinary, because I like the Avenue du Mont-Royal and I really wish I liked this place!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try some mexican food on Mont Royal but unfortunately, the food received lacked any of the spice, flavor or freshness we were hoping for.   Our server was courteous, but aside from taking our order, delivering our meals and presenting our check, we didn't see him. The nachos we ordered were soggy and microwaved.  The steak had good flavor, but there was only a small scattering of cheese and no salsa though it did look like the juice of some type of salsa had been poured over the chips.   My flautas may have been fried to crisp at one point, but were clearly warmed, possibly in a microwave, before service as they were so hard they were almost impossible to cut.   My partner's fajitas were served in the most haphazard way I've ever seen fajitas presented.  The chicken was shredded and stewed, not grilled and piled over some soggy flour tortillas.  The salsas, both types served, were completely flavorless. There was no spice whatsoever. The \"spanish rice\" served on the side looked to be plain, steamed rice stirred together with a bag of frozen mixed vegetables.   Nothing we were served tasted of anything. With the exception of the few pieces of grilled steak on our nachos, the meal was completely flavorless.  We were so disappointed as latin food, in general, is not readily available on Mont Royal. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Enchilada Rojas and Burrito Salsa Verde with a in house hot sauce to share. Basically wanted to destroy these dishes as soon as they made it to our table. The serving portions were pleasantly large and flavors were delectable. Service was friendly and the environment was lively. Will call this my local Mexican restaurant as it's definitely great bang for your buck and always a bumpin spot"}
{"text":"The food was not that bad but not good enough to salvage the issues. First, I ordered pick up and when I got there 50 minutes later the lady at the counter told me it would take five minutes for the order to be ready. I waited 25 minutes before receiving my order. Meanwhile, a person who ordered his order as I walked in received it 10 minutes before me. 1h15 to get my food ready is ridiculous and they did not provide any explanation. Second, I specifically asked that there is no sesame seed on any of the food because my brother is allergic. Lo and behold, there was sesame on the mole when I opened the food box. Very disappointed, I really recommend not encouraging such incompetency."}
{"text":"Bon snackbar! Très économique. Bon choix au menu. Terrasse sur la rue Mont Royal et fenêtre ouvrable sur toute la façade. Mobilier très simple. Les mets sont très bon."}
{"text":"Went specifically for all-you-can eat tacos & beer for 2 for $30. Very good deal. Wasn't the best mexican I've had, but not bad for the price."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good however, we got a lousy server. She didn't bring water to the table, didn't bring the nacho chips & sauce and all her other tables received them. I ordered crush right of the menu for my kids and she said they didn't have any and offered me the more expensive Jarritos soda (hello up charge) After I refused twice, they all of a sudden, they have orange Fanta. After confirming they have Coke, I ordered one. She came with a bottle. I told my husband to check the bill and sure enough another up charge.   The food was great and the manager made up for the lousy service by bringing water and adjusting the soda charge.    Don't think we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Voici un restaurant/snack Mexicain qui fait sa job. Nous avons pris plusieurs plats que nous avons partagés. C'était bon mais sans plus.  Nous avons pris des enchiladas rojas, un burrosaurio (sorte de burritos géant de 18 pouces) et des nachos.  Le service n'était par contre vraiment pas à la hauteur. Nous avons vu la serveuse quand nous sommes arrivés; quand nous avons commandés, et quand elle nous apporté nos plats. Et......c'est tout. Pas de remplissage de verre d'eau, pas de \"ça va bien ici\". Nous nous sommes levés pour avoir la facture car elle était certainement trop occupée à jouer sur son smart phone.  Dommage. Car ce petit resto sans prétention peu dépanner en cas de groooosse envie de Mexicain."}
{"text":"Quand les autres restaurants de la rue du Mont Royal sont pleins, ou si vous aimez la cuisine tex mex sans qu'elle soit trop travaillée. Les plats proposés sont simples et bons. Les eaux aromatisées sur place sont vraiment rafraîchissantes. Équipe accueillante et décontractée."}
{"text":"The was the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant. First, my friend and I arrive at around 8:30 pm for the all you can eat taco's + sangria for two special. We wait 10 minutes without a host/hostess coming over to even say I will be with you shortly or something like that.   We finally just go to the bar and ask if we can seat ourselves on the terasse. They tell us the terasse is closed. We look again, and see that many of the people had literally just arrived at the terasse, with full pitchers of sangria. We are two people, we are not going to take more than 30-40 min tops. We finally just say ok ... thinking that its weird on a warm Saturday night at 8:30 pm that the terasse should randomly 'be closed'. They then proceed to tell us we need to wait 40 minutes for a table. When there's literally 3 tables on the terasse they could have seated us at. We again say ok, no problem, and we walk down the street and wait at starbucks.   We come back 30 mins later, and they seat us. However, two girls who had been on the terasse before we'd left were still there, so we point out to the server that they've inconvenienced us by making us wait 40 mins for no reason when we could have eaten and left by now. He doesn't care, just points in the direction of a table so we sit.   There was one menu at the table, no water, no silverware. We give our order right away to the waitress. The tacos were so bad. I mean literally they were microwaved ground beef on a warmed up tortilla. You could taste the cold parts of the meat in the middle of the taco. I was already so fed up with this experience that I didn't want to make a big deal about it, but honestly the taco meat was cold. We asked for more salsa (to block out the bland cold taco meat and the fact that there was not even sour cream or a little lettuce or tomato on the tacos). She tells us they have no more. No more taco sauce ? In a Mexican restaurant ? okay...    We'd finished the tacos, and typically a waitress would come ask if we wanted another round (they are all you can eat after all) or ask if we want water or something since there was none. Not this waitress. Instead, I tried to make eye contact with her or waive at her to show we needed something, to no avail. I finally got up and went over and asked her if we could please have more. Rude and inattentive.   I think the combination of the horrible service and horrible 'tacos' is enough to never come here again. Telling us to wait 40 minutes because the terasse was 'closed' then coming back to see that there were still people on it, they had not cleaned it up yet, etc..it just shows what horrible customer service they have. I mean just it doesn't meet even a basic minimal standard, they have no regard for customers. When we'd first arrived, there was a couple with a baby who were standing forever, despite that tables were open. They finally were seated once i'd approached the host to ask about sitting on the terasse. When we came back form the 40 min wait, the couple had already finished apparently and left the restaurant. The people that were on the terasse before the 40 min wait still were there, enjoying drinks and tacos. My point is that in that same time period that they had us waiting, we would have probably finished before the people on the terasse.  Stay clear of here. Taco bell would be a better option that this place tbh. Don Taco, Mais, Else's, etc are all much better options if you are in the mood for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"-Food: Tacos El Pastor came to our table cold, without any cilantro or chopped onions as pictured in menu. Meat tasted stale or old -Bathrooms: no soap in washroom, when the staff was asked to provide some, they put palmolive DISH SOAP in the bathroom.  -This was not authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"family owned nice and cozy place, close to me so i pick up things often, people rating here too severely should know we are not in us, for mtl standard its pretty good mex food. like their pastor and cactus tacos :)"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. The best one is the tacos al pastor and the picadiilo tacos. Great sauces. If you are with a friend and you both love tacos, go for the all you can eat deal for two and it comes with a pitcher of beer."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal, and just happened upon this restaurant.  We had chicken quesadilla and nachos.  Everything was delicious!  (We have been staying away from ordering beef while in Canada, because my husband's previous experience was that it tasted different than the U.S. Corn-fed beef that we are used to.  Maybe that influenced some of the other reviews.)  We were very happy with the service, and we received our food quickly."}
{"text":"Tacos al pastor without pineapple, I asked the waitress and the answer was: it's all mixed. But I never found them, not even the taste.  The margaritas were OK."}
