{"text":"Better than some in the area, but still lacking in a few ways. Crab rangoons are always burnt and delivery takes way too long (only 1 driver)."}
{"text":"The restaurant has 6 tables which make it possible for you to eat-in, but this place is definitely more suited towards take out or delivery.  Just don't expect service if you eat-in.  You order at a counter and if you choose to eat-in, you will get your soup in a take out container, eat on paper plates and styrofoam cups, but get your entrees served on platters.  The house special won ton soup was pretty tasty and was loaded with a variety of fresh veggies, as well as chicken, pork, and shrimp pieces.  However, one key ingredient was missing - won tons!  General Tso's chicken was fried and served with broccoli and sufficient sauce.  The Mongolian beef was more Mongolian and less beef.  Overall the food was OK, except for the disappointment of the missing wontons, and I would probably consider this place again for delivery."}
{"text":"I have picked orders from here a few times over the past few years when I was really craving Chinese since it is so close to me. Food is hit and miss and the last time I ordered from here 2 days ago it was really bad. A few things I should mention. 1. It is really dirty inside and I would never eat in the restaurant. 2. The staff/owners are pretty rude and obnoxious. The owners kids were inside the restaurant riding scooters inside the dining area. This will be my last time. I'll just do China Panda next time."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who others have spoken to, but the lady that answered the phone to take our order tonight was pleasant and helpful. We eat mostly gluten free and she was able to use the chicken breast without the breading for our combo meals. The house rice is really good (it has chicken, shrimp, and pork in it), the orange chicken was great, my husbands general tso was very good and my sons sweet & sour chicken was good. I would've liked more vegetables in the combo meal, but it was a good size portion. The crab Rangoon were very good, although a bit on the extra oily side. The egg rolls were just ok. My husband commented that it's probably the best Chinese we've had since we moved to az. They said it would be 40 minutes to deliver and it was here in 20. I have zero complaints and would totally eat here again."}
{"text":"Used Grub Hub to place a delivery order. Confirmation email said be 50-60 minutes. Right at 45 minute mark driver rang the bell. Hot & sour soup was very good, General Tso's chicken cooked properly and not tough. Chicken fried rice was also tasty. Best part was the price,  very competitive if not lower than most in area. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We are thrilled to have stumbled upon this place! We have been looking for good hot and sour soup and we found it. We also had their mooshu pork. All of it was delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Even though they have the best Chinese food around their customer service is horrid. We can go in and they act like we're bothering them. When we call in we're a nuisance. Do you want our money? They are rude!!! Last time we chose this place. 4th times a charm for never going again. Worst part is they have great food!!!!"}
{"text":"Cannot believe my last review was 4 years ago.  They are just as good today and always consistent.  I picked up Shrimp Moo Shi, my first time trying this dish.  So delicious.  I like taking food home so I can eat a little at a time.  They packaged it in such away, that makes it easy to heat up a small amount at a time.  I just love this family run business.  They really do quality dishes and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since my last review so I thought I'd take the time to give an update. First off, we're still ordering take out multiple times a month. It's that good and the family is never tired of it. The prices are great for the portions they give you, they do not skimp! We have always had good service over the phone and polite delivery drivers.   On to the food! Being vegetarian I appreciate all of the veggie options and love that they pack in a ton of fresh veggies! I have liked every tofu dish I have tried. Garlic is still my go-to though! The vegetable dumplings were a favorite also but sadly they changed their recipe and what used to be a cabbage, green onion & tofu fill is now a blended broccoli medley of sorts and not nearly as good. Not to mention, it's not at all what I'd expect to find in dumplings. So that was a huge bummer. They will be missed  I will still come for the main dishes but will be searching for a new dumpling place."}
{"text":"Very good stuff. The pork fried rice is my favorite. Everything on the menu looks good. The service is pretty good too. The dining room is small, but clean and bright.  I attempted to try a place around the corner instead and it didn't hold a candle to this place."}
{"text":"Glad I found this place.  Really great tasting Chinese food and I love the delivery service.  Can't wait to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but delivery service is absolutely horrible. I ordered during the night, and the driver didn't get my address correctly, which caused a 10 min delay when the driver figured out they screwed up. Then, when the driver delivered my food, they had the audacity to tell me that I should have ordered sooner. This is all after they had a terrible attitude over the phone when I placed my order. Now I'm the type of person where when I go out to eat, I normally add 20% gratuity on my bill, even if the service wasn't spectacular. For this, I couldn't even add on a tip because the service was so bad. It was like they had no appreciation for the huge mess up they did, and then blame me that I should have ordered sooner.   If I were an ant, I'd expect better service at an aardvark convention. Not going back, no thanks!"}
{"text":"Great food, easy online ordering and speedy delivery, food was here in 20 minutes. Delivery gal gave us a New menu. Consistently fresh Every Time."}
{"text":"I love this place for chinese food. I am from the East coast and I was always trying to find a place that even compares to what you get in Boston or New York.This place is as close as you will get and they are so fast with delivery.I always get my food within 30 minutes and it is steaming hot. They are always friendly.I have never had a problem and my order is always correct.. I had given up on chinese food in this area.....and then I found them and so happy that i did. They are as close to New York and Boston as i will get in this area."}
{"text":"Worse Chinese food that I've ever had. Very bland. Definitely not worth trying again."}
{"text":"King Wok is a newly opened Chinese food (New York Style) place on Warner and Lindsey.  I first heard of this place by one of my family members who had ordered many items for a party.  The food was good, so I decided to go there myself and see how they handled the individual dishes.    I was expecting and hoping it to be a \"sit down\" type restaurant however it was another one of those fast food Chinese restaurants.  I was a little bummed (fearing for bum) out about that but I decided to give this place a fair chance.  I order the amazing chicken....and guess what it wasn't really amazing.  It was good, but not amazing :).  My wife had the orange chicken which was very good, I highly recommend it.  Even after keeping the leftovers for the next day, it still tasted very good.    After leaving the place I was happy about it but not too excited.   In summary, it has good food and if you are near to it I would definitely recommend this place for party food and takeout.  I would give this place 3.5 stars....but what the heck Ill give it a chance :)"}
{"text":"Delicious, reasonably priced take out place. It's always kind of scary to order from a take out place but this place was great! I definitely recommend ordering the Kung pao chicken. The dumplings had thick dough (too much for my taste) but the filling was delicious! If I order Chinese in the area I'll definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Sooo lucky to have King wok walking distance from the house!  They are the best around for NY style Chinese & priced well for their big portions too.   We eat there at least monthly & it's always a treat - take out or delivery I've never had any bad to say about them - top notch."}
{"text":"The service is great! Hardly any wait. The egg Foo yong is delicious and the house won ton soup is my favorite.  We have been eating at King Wok at least twice a month.  We love it!"}
{"text":"We have take out here maybe once per month. I wish we had better options. The food quality is great but it seems that you are bothering them when you make an order. This would be the best Chinese takeout spot around if they cared about customers."}
{"text":"Great value, ordered 3 lunch specials beef broccoli, orange chicked and chicken low mein. Also got an order of wonton soup. Everything tasted great with the exception of the wonton soup. Orange chicken was hands down the favorite lots of solid flavor in that dish.  Overall it wasn't the best Chinese I've ever had but for the price (4.99) of the lunch specials that include rice and a spring roll I will gladly consider myself a regular."}
{"text":"So to start I think I should say I don't really like Chinese food. That being said I ordered the BBQ chicken sticks and it was some of the best chicken I've ever had. I'm writing this just because of those four lovely skewers of chicken. Still haven't tried any of my other food yet... hold on. Lemme try the beef and broccoli. Yeah. It's pretty good too.  Not like the chicken though. That shot was amazing"}
{"text":"Can't speak for the food because we never got it but HORRIBLE SERVICE! Rude lady answered the phone, didn't understand a word that was said..including phone number, address, or debit card # (thank goodness). Ended call by shouting \"40 minutes\" into the phone and hanging up. Called an hour later and asked where our food was at which time they told us they didn't hear anything we had said during the first call then hung up. Called back and girl asked numerous times for debit card # to cancel..WHY!?!? Considering they said they missed the # the first time! You're horrible to deal w/ King Wok, never again!"}
{"text":"I find this small place to have the very best Chinese (taste and variety) in the entire East Valley.   No others come close.   Flavors and portions are top notch!"}
{"text":"I decided to try a new Chinese food place tonight since I was craving fried rice. I usually order form Taste of China.  However after looking at some yelp reviews I figured I would give this place a try.   I found their website and thought it was cool to place my order online. They have so many choices on their menu and decent prices.   I placed my order online. I ordered Sweet and Sour Pork with pork fried rice and pan fried meat dumplings. After I placed my order I received my confirmation email, but I could not find a time to pick up my food.   Thankfully I only live a mile down the street. When I arrived to pick up my order it was packaged neatly and waiting for me when I walked in. The owners children were doing homework at one of the booths,and the back door past the kitchen was propped open.  After speaking with one of the ladies at the register she told me that next time not to order online since it costs them to much money. If this is true why do they offer this option?   Once I got home and saw what I got I was a little skeptical. It looked very different from my usual food, and after tasting it I was not at all impressed. The sweet and sour sauce was thick almost like jello, and more on the artificial sweet side than traditional sweet and sour. The pork had way to much breading on it considering the size of the meat. The fried rice was the best part, but I found onions and bean sprouts in it. Not my cup of tea. The pan fried dumplings were not crispy as I have had elsewhere and lacked flavor. The meat inside had no distinct flavor and I could not identify what kind of meat it was. i also received an egg roll with my order. The egg roll was extremely greasy.    Overall, You do receive alot of food, but the quality is just not there. I would not recommend this place to a friend and I will not be purchasing again."}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery. It came quicker than I expected.  The entrees arrived packaged in plastic containers and the rice was in typical Chinese take-out paper boxes.  The pork fried rice was awesome.   The Kung Pao Chicken was good, except that the peanuts tasted raw -- as if they were tossed on top of the food after cooking rather than being cooked with the chicken and veggies.  The Sesame chicken and orange beef were also quite tasty.  The food does remind me of the Chinese take-out I've had in Manhattan. It is good food, but I've had much better. Given that they deliver, I'll likely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered via phone and it was delivered in about 20 minutes. I ordered the lemon and coconut chicken and it's so good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant here. especially that sweet & sour chicken?mongilia beef?kung pao chicken and General Tso's Chicken are the best decelious food in my 25 years life. It's essential in my daily food."}
{"text":"Were we order out ~ it's from King Work.  They are always fast and fresh.  The food is consistent . . . and the deliever people are friendly . . . plus the cost is very reasonable.  Blessings to them and the good job they do.  : ) KC"}
{"text":"This used to be my \"go to\" Chinese take out place.  No more since I saw their Dirty Dining violations.  This review will probably be removed just like my last one."}
{"text":"Let me begin with I ordered seafood in a land locked state.  That may have been the problem from the get go.  Shrimp fried rice made me sick and my company that had the chicken didn't enjoy it either.  We threw our leftovers out."}
{"text":"Placed a order thru grub hub. Waited and waited no food. Call restaurant and due to language barriers she would not accept what I was explaining to her. Drove up to restaurant and showed her my order and order number and they would not accept it. Only excuse was fax machine wasn't working for a few hours. Not my problem. Said she would make it and take 20% off, not what I needed to hear. Explained you have been paid and I shouldn't have to pay again. Said they never got order and won't honor what I placed already. Have been ordering here for years and never had issue and when i do it's my problem. Not ordering here again."}
{"text":"The pork fried rice is worth it by it's self.  Their chicken curry is really good, and I have had a lot of curry in my time. The potstickers are good, the service is good. I can go on and on. Nice to see the small businesses doing good work."}
{"text":"My family orders from this restaurant several times a month. Every time we order either online or at store, the people are mean, rude and down right offensive. The food is good, but as soon as we find another ny style restaurant we will take our business their. I suggest you shop around if your not local..  Original review 9/25/14 Update 12/9/14  Update: We went back to this restaurant as it was late in the evening and other stores were to far to go to. Much to my surprise, the service was considerably better. Almost as if they \"got the message\" well done guy's. Everyone was super friendly and really went out of there way to make sure the service was good. Please, Please, Please, keep it up!! Nice job!  My original review was 1 star and I've since changed it to 4..."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the orange chicken and the egg rolls were tasty.   Portion size was very generous given the price.  Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome pork fried rice, very good egg rolls. Overall I like the food a lot. Staff is always nice."}
{"text":"The food absolutely amazing. The best take out I have ever had. My wife and I can't stop thinking about the food. I felt like I was cheating on her while eating the Orange Chicken. Keep it up."}
{"text":"This is exactly the place I crave for Everything Fried Rice (They call it House Special, a mix of all the meats & veggies). My husband and I are originally from North Jersey, as many others have said the phone/service is what you expect ordering \"NY style Chinese\" as they call it. Delivery is FAST. Great stuff, we love the Shrimp in Garlic sauce, their wonton soup, the crunchy noodles, and hubs ALWAYS orders a large Chicken Lo Mein and doesn't share, ha!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in all of Arizona. How do I know this?  1) I am full 100% Asian. 2) I grew up in LA and San Francisco. 3) I have eaten at almost every Chinese place in AZ.  Ok, the last one is not entirely true, but after eating at King Wok, I don't need to try another Chinese joint. It's a hole in the wall, in a GoodWill strip mall, but it is incredibly delicious.  If u know anything about Chinese food, u know that NY and SF have the best Chinese. King Wok brings that to AZ and I couldn't be happier!  No more Panda Express or Pei Wei or PF Changs for this gal, it's all about King Wok!!!!!"}
{"text":"They have new york style chow mein! I have been looking for a place that serves this for years. They have fast delivery and great crab puffs and fried rice too. :)"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good NY style Chinese place since we moved here. I FOUND IT. This place is so good, the rice is fantastic, the food is very good. I got it to go so I don't care about the service or that there were kids in the dining room doing their homework.... its a family place.... get over it. The prices are great and the portions are great as well.  This is my new spot for takeout."}
{"text":"Great food, delivery super fast.  They said 30-45 mins and it was more like 20 mins.  I'll have to remember to order \"no vegies\" next time, lol.    Will go again."}
{"text":"We get delivery at least once per month,  using the online ordering. Convenient, remembers your past orders.  Shrimp kung pap, hubby favorite. Yummy dumplings, egg foo young, lomein. Quick delivery, huge portions. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from this place for the past five years. The food is the closest to Chinese takeout that I grew up with in NJ/NY. Those who have criticized the food probably grew up with the fake, bland, franchised \"Chinese food\" I've found out here on the west coast.   The woman who answers the phone can be a bit abrupt, but again, this is typical of authentic family-owned east coast Chinese restaurants. Authentic and family-owned are both rarities here in Arizona. At this point my husband and I find it kind of endearing.   I've picked up my order once when my best friend from NJ was here visiting and she came back out to the car and commented on how clean it was inside.   Anyhow, after five years, I wanted to give them our good review!"}
{"text":"Gave the guy a $5 tip and he didn't even say thank you. The staff are not friendly at all and it sounds like all they are doing is arguing with one another in Chinese. Lemon chicken has too thick of a coating and the lemon sauce is bland. The pancakes for the Moo Shi are heavy like tortillas... what's with that?   The menu is very broad but our take home boxes never made it in the house."}
{"text":"This is delicious New York Styled Chinese take-out.  The food has excellent flavor and the dishes are inexpensive and loaded with veggies.   My husband and I spent 3 years looking for a New York style Chinese restaurant. We had so many disappointing meals all over the valley.  Then we found this place, in our neighborhood! It was so wonderful.  This is not a place to sit and eat unless you're looking for a fast meal. It's a great take-out place, I can't recommend it highly enough.   The owners are very friendly - go there a few times and they'll remember you."}
{"text":"Great food fair prices.  They are happy to adjust the spiciness as requested.  One family member is sensitive to spice and I love it.  We are both happy. Fast friendly delivery again at a fair price."}
{"text":"Food arrived 1 hour and 45 mins late.  We called 2x  Last call we made, they hung up.  They refused to refund and take the food back.  Never buying from this place again.   Been a loyal customer since 2012. It's not the first time  this kind of bad service  happened.  If you're reading this, any recommendation for a Chinese restaurant that provides consistently good service, and timely delivery?"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place before and I remember it being \"not bad\".. definitely a lot cheaper than the place closer to the house.    Ordered for delivery - Arrived right around the time-frame they gave me.    Got the fried wontons, sweet & sour chicken, and the broccoli with pork .   Fried wontons were dry/hard, essentially flavourless and just tough to eat.    Sweet and sour chicken (sauce on side).. was basically a bucket of fried chicken chunks with the plain red sauce in a tub of its own.  The chicken itself wasn't terrible, but it wasn't particularly good either.  Most places I've gotten this from serve it with pineapple and vegetable chunks in the sauce.. So this was just a bit bland and boring for me.    The broccoli with pork was OK.. I can't complain really as I didn't have much of it.    The thing that is actually making me write this review was the white rice that came with it... I had a bit of it with the sweet and sour chicken.. no problem.. then when I went to dump a bit more out, I noticed a big long black hair coming out with the rice.  Nice.  Well.. that was all for that meal.    Oh.. I did have a fortune cookie as well.. it said \"photographic memory, just don't have film\".    Thanks.     So I'd give it 2 stars for delivery time and value.. but the hair thing was pretty gross.. and nothing else was very good.  Sorry.. 1 star.  EDIT: I moved a few months ago and this happens to be the closest Chinese place to my house now.  I tried a couple of other places nearby and was disappointed in either the quality or how the pricing on their website was inaccurate.  So I'm back at King Wok.. I've gotta say I'm liking it.  I've been there a  half-dozen times since my last review and I haven't had a bad meal since.  Quality has been quite good.. and quite fast.. I haven't gotten delivery as I basically live across the street, but that was the one positive thing before.  They usually have my order done in 10 minutes for takeout.  I would now recommend this place if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Very good food for a great low price. Not a place you take a date - it's built for carry out and for the occasional dine in. Rarely in AZ do you find quantity and quality for a reasonable price, especially in Gilbert. I've not been impressed with any Chinese restaurants in the Chandler Mesa, Gilbert area until now. King Wok will now be my \"go-to\" for carry out. For those who complain about delivery service, that's always a gamble - from any restaurant. I used to deliver food and know this - driver's leave the restaurant with 2-3 deliveries minimum so the food isn't always going to be hot - or accurate."}
{"text":"Awesome and amazing delicious food. Fresh  and everything. HOWEVER, it took 2 hours for us to receive our food. Called at 5:42pm and didn't get it till 7:35pm. We have three kids under 5 who were so hungry... Prob would have been faster going somewhere else... 2 hours is just ridiculous! 1 star for good food... Zero for terrible delivery! And 1 for the apology and kind man who delivered!"}
{"text":"Love the lunch specials. Great price and good food. I usually pick up and take home for dinner. Three people under twenty. Just make sure to order by three when the lunch specials end."}
{"text":"NY style Chinese food is the best! Been going to King Wok for 9 years now...there is no other place I will bother trying. I wish their dine in was a little more inviting, so I usually opt take out."}
{"text":"I am from Seattle and the best Chinese food is found from SF to BC and in between.  This is the 4th Chinese restaurant we have tried since moving here.  we ordered the egg drop soup, tasteless.  Orange chicken,I was hesitant to order that because it is described as hot and spicy.  It was not in the least hot or spicy but it did have very good flavor.  Almond chicken was bland, weird and not sure what was almond about it.  Pork fried rice had no flavor. Shrimp with Chinese vegetables was very good.  I gave it 3 stars because the orange chicken and the shrimp was good and it is the first place that did not end up in the trash can."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The food is good and always fresh. Prices are average but the portions are pretty large. It's a family business, which is always a plus. It would be 5 stars but the last time I was in their little shit kids wouldn't leave me alone. They were being rude and obviously couldn't take a hint to leave me alone. We actually went home to finish our food to get away from their children. The children should not be bothering your customers."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been coming here for years for my fix. This place is just like \"home\" (NY/NJ), from the STEAMED dumplings to the pork fried rice... You can't go wrong. This is NY style Chinese food at it's best. Delivery or pick up is recommended, but the food is great, the service is good, the delivery is fast, I just wouldn't recommend hanging out in there.  Overall, worth it."}
{"text":"Fresh and hot food! Honey chicken and shrimp tasted very good and orange chicken as well! Would definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"I have ordered here before (General's chicken) and beef and broccoli but tonight we had the worst lo mein and coconut shrimp we ever had.  The lo mein was so bland and the coconut shrimp breading was so thick and untasty. I cannot even identify what type of breading they used.  it actually ruined the sauce - i would have rather ate the sauce alone with a spoon.  We didn't even save the leftovers.  I won't not order from her again but will make note of these two items.  DO NOT ORDER them."}
{"text":"As a NYC/Queens native, I have been longing for some good Chinese food. I hit the jackpot with King Wok. The food is just so good. Portions are large so lots of leftovers. They catered my son's birthdsy party and threw n lots of freebies.  Lunch specials are super inexpensive and so much food it literally falls off the plate. Spicy chicken and broccoli, you gotta try it."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, kings Wok is the best Chinese food I have found in the east valley so far. Everything that I have had from here has been super tasty!"}
{"text":"Great delivery!  I really have no idea what New York style Chinese food is.  But, this is our go-to place in the summer when I don't feel like slaving in front of the stove.  The lunch special comes with an entree, steamed rice/fried rice, crab puff, egg roll and soup (hot and sour, egg drop, wonton) for less than $6.  Char siu fried rice is worth trying. Our faves are orange chicken, beef broccolli, shrimp and vegetables,  lo mein and egg foo young.  This place is inexpensive and quick, we've never had to wait more than 45 minutes for the delivery."}
{"text":"extremely rude on the phone, was very short and stern. acted annoyed with any tiny question I asked. My experience was already off to a bad start thanks to that."}
{"text":"I love this place! We literally drove by for years before deciding to try it. Hot and sour soup is excellent and Kung pao chicken is my favorite. We got takeout last Friday and I decided to try their buffalo wings, not sure what I was thinking since this is an Asian restaurant but they were amazing! Very big, all wings, crispy with great flavor. Will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful. I've lived in Arizona for over 15 years and this little place was the first one that made Cantonese Egg Fu Yung correctly. Perfection. Kung Pao and Orange Chicken were both delicious. Hot and sour soup could use a little more spice and vinegar. Also didn't have the traditional pork or wood ear mushrooms. I will order again!  Had food delivered and was received well before the eta."}
{"text":"This place is baller. Lots of really good Asian food for cheap. What more could you want? Make sure you get the pork fried rice when you get your combo, it makes it that much better. I've had Chinese food all over Arizona, especially in Tucson and this restaurant beats most placed I've been to in Tucson."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  They are a little slow to make the food even if you call it in but so far I have liked everything I have eaten."}
{"text":"The take-out here is awesome! The service isn't very sociable but I'm trying to get some food not make new friends. My favorite thing to order is the garlic chicken and lo mein noodles. I've tried the beef and broccoli along with the Mongolian beef. Which I would stray away from... The beef just tastes strange and is extremely soft. Chicken products are good though! Delivery takes about 30-40 minutes. I find they come a little earlier which is great! Overall a very decent and convenient Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"If your a New York metro area transplant then you must try this humble little Chinese Restaurant. They originally owned a place in NYC and subsequently moved to Arizona to continue the tradition of amazing Chinese take-out.    Many East Coast favorites can be found here such as Shrimp Toast,  Chow Fun and real Garlic chicken. Their soups are spot on and food is always constant and plentiful."}
{"text":"Never eat in - have only had take out - so this review is only based on the food.  Have ordered a wide variety of their dishes and this is the best Chinese I've found in the East Valley.     Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food, if you can call it that. Ordered the spare ribs which were like tire rubber, the eggrolls had no taste and tough, the garlic chicken was awful, beef and broccoli tasteless, chicken fried rice smelled old and was tasteless. So disappointed with the quality of the food. We had it delivered and it took 50 minutes, they got the address wrong. I will not order again from here, ever. Eater's beware!!!"}
{"text":"Worse place ever! Called and ordered 2 Shrimp Lo mein  large. The order that came was chicken. I called to let them know and the women confirmed she will send someone with the correct order.   The food arrives they ask us to give them the previous order for the new one. We gave it to them and the man asks for 1.60 difference. Mind you I gave a 4 dollar tip. He then yells at us because the previous food feels light and that we changed our order.   Normally I don't like to complain but this was stupid service. In fact I thinks it silly when people do sometime. This time it's important to do so.   The shrimp lo mein that arrived at shrimp that clearly is old and has gone bad. Now I don't have any food and they won't return my money.   Basically don't order from this place. Rude,old food and on top of that no shame in yelling at you when you accommodate the poor service.  P.S. They say they record you. You will not be told you are being recorded and that is illegal in the state of Arizona.   This place should not be in business."}
{"text":"I was looking for some delicious Chinese food near the area that I was running some errands in and came across this place on my Google Maps. I checked out the menu online to make sure it wasn't a carbon copy of Panda Express - which, thankfully for my starving-Chinese-food-loving-belly, it was not.  I went for the Beef Chow Fun and Singapore Chicken - one dish that's very standard, and one mystery dish (because I had no idea what would be inside it other than chicken.)  The Chow Fun was PERFECT. My face lit up upon the scent of the dish alone - I lit up even more once I took a bite. I saw golden noodles dancing in front of me. Could it really be this good? In Arizona? I felt like I had traveled instantaneously to a small mom-and-pop noodle shop in the 626.   The Singapore Chicken had mushrooms, which are not my fave, but the dish itself was so delicious, I couldn't have cared less. The sauce was the key flavor to making this dish fantastic. A little sweet, sour, tangy and spicy. The chicken was perfectly cooked. I could have eaten two of these. Even the side of rice was good.  They are fast, friendly, and make great dishes. This restaurant has something for everyone (even that guy who thinks Panda Express is \"traditional\" Chinese food.)  The dish prices are fair, and the portions are generous. The restaurant itself was clean and I definitely felt comfortable inside.   I will certainly come back even if it is a bit of a drive from where I'm normally at. This has definitely made its way into my top 5 Chinese nom nom spots in the Valley. Definitely worth every penny and gallon of gas.   My first-time experience was A+!  EDIT/UPDATE: Still solid."}
{"text":"I order from them often.  My favorites are Mongolian Beef and Hunan Beef.  The portions are large and the quality is good.  I love spicy food and they will make it extra spicy if you want them to.  Only one time in 12 take out orders did they make a mistake.  I ordered extra rice and I didn't receive it. I'll take those odds.  I'm not going to lie, I have a bad habit of calling them right before close and ordering takeout.  Yeah, I'm that guy!  But, the food always seems fresh and I'm thrilled when they are willing to take my order.  Its always tasty and they provide plenty of sauces to doctor it up if you wish.  Only on one occasion, they actually called me back and said \"how much tip\"...and I replied \"$10\".  She said \"ok, see you soon.\"  The food was delivered in 5 minutes.  Every delivery driver I have ever had an interaction with is very appreciative of my standard $10 tip, and it seems like it literally makes their day.    I've never dined in, but I will continue to order takeout as long as I live in the area."}
{"text":"Somewhat dirty store; unfriendly staff; flavorless food; red/bloody looking meat; will never go back"}
{"text":"Huge portions and food pretty good! Very fast service as well and location perfect for us. I love the 'east coast ' style of food. Orange chicken is great!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place out. Was craving cheap chinese. Glad I came!   I got the honey chicken combo which was all white meat and not rubbery!! Very satisfied with the quality. I'm picky with my Chinese chicken dishes and this place was spot on.  Fried rice could use some work. The price was right and the place looks clean. Family run and the kids are funny!   Will def go back."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever eaten at!   Let me preface my review by saying I've lived in several states, but spent the majority of my life in the upper-Midwest; if you like that style of Chinese food, this is the place for you!   The regional differences in American-Chinese food is heavier than many would suspect, however many of my fellow Midwestern-ers turned Arizonians agree that this is the place to go for eastern American Chinese food.  Everything we've had so far has been above average  to excellent (well, except the Hot and Sour soup which was kind of blah).  Seriously, I recommend this place to everyone when they ask!   (and the driver is super friendly :) )"}
{"text":"I placed my order online which of course wasn't too difficult. I did ask for a substitute - chow mein versus fried rice. The lady called me and I didn't happen to answer (I don't answer calls I don't know the number) and she leaves a message telling me chow mein will be extra and to call back.   I call back about 5 minutes later and I can't quite understand all of what she says, but what I did understand is that she sent the driver out with the order with the rice. She said that I didn't call her back right away so she sent him out and that I should answer the phone next time she calls.  The driver got here, was nice enough without saying anything but smiled, and left. Delivery was about 40 minutes. The food was actually quite decent. If it weren't for the rude lady I could barely understand, this establishment would receive a much higher rating."}
{"text":"In town visiting family and got a flyer in the mail. I couldn't believe that the lunch special list was so extensive and only $5.50 a person. Taking into consideration the medium size popcorn at the Gilbert Movie theater was $6.50 it just didn't make sense. We decieded to take a chance and go eat in the place was bustling with take out orders and so I knew it was not going to disappoint. I had the Kung Pao Chicken with fried rice and my Mother had the Shrimp Lo Mein. I'm from Seattle and was pleasently surprised to see that they used fresh yes fresh not frozen vegtables. There was even cucumber in my dish and you could really taste it. They also had a big screen t.v. playing court shows which provided some good entertainment as well. Hope that others will try this little gem the other place I tried here in town for Chinese was inedible and I don't know why its in buisness other then the guy who owns it everyone seems to love. PRINCIPLES OVER PERSONALITY when it comes to food and King Wok is the overall winner here!"}
{"text":"I decided to try King Wok after reading reviews on Yelp... It's also really close to my house.  This place is not that good.  It's just eh.  I thought it lacked flavor that I love in prepared food.  It is inexpensive, which is a plus.  I got eggrolls, almond chicken, and chow mein.  Their sweet and sour sauce was too sweet, the almond chicken sauce tasted like flavorless goo, and the chow mein tasted sweet too.  I really liked the people who worked there and really wanted to love it, especially because it's almost the last business left in that shopping area.    I think I'll have to try something else there... Definitely worth a try though."}
{"text":"I get take out on a frequent basis. I love their sweet sour soup !  Good quality for a reasonable price. The dine-in area is small and dated.  I always call in my order. Never a problem."}
{"text":"True China food prepared like the east coast we're used to. I'm from MA and this place has the Chinese menu we are used to in Boston or even NY. It's not the closest one for us in Gilbert but it is the best. Have tried others but this will be our regular stop. Prices are reasonable. I have to give a shot out to the woman taking orders and ringing them up. I first gave my order to a man that was there and he had an attitude because I was using more than one card. The woman there took my payments with ease and professionalism. She knows how to handle a business. Didn't make me feel bad for using different cards. His expression at first made me feel uncomfortable but she made up for it with her attitude and grace. If you're looking for real Chinese food and good prices this is good place. They're quick and accurate when you place a phone order. Food hot like it should be."}
{"text":"Horrible service, drove from chandler because we heard this was the best. Picked up our to go order and NO noodles in the chow mein. We called and the said they would deliver the noodle after we told them were we lived they said its too far they are too busy to deal with it and we get a 3 dollar credit. The dish was around 8 dollars and the reason to get chow mein is the noodles. After spending time on the phone the lady said the noodles aren't even that good and \"customer don't like\" why are they on your menu then?  The way they deal with customers is horrible save your coin."}
{"text":"What a shit hole. ..can't believe this place is open.. The food is over priced..prices are set for a wine and dine not fast food atmosphere. .dishes are big. .but the taste wasn't that great...The floor was so slippery and wet I couldn't get up to get napkins  was just gross..never ever going back.."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out here 100 times at least. Awesome lo mein and pan fried dumplings. The egg drop soup is prefect when you are fighting a cold. Very friendly staff.   I laugh when I read other reviews about people not being able to understand what the staff is saying. Were you expecting British people to cook your Chinese food?  These guys have been around for years for a reason.  Looking forward to getting some take out on Christmas!"}
{"text":"The food here is actually quite good.   We ordered Spring rolls, egg rolls, orange/sweet & Sour/honey chicken and a couple different soups.    Really well prepared, lots of flavor and it was pretty obvious they're not trying to cut corners.   It tasted...fresh.    I knocked off a star; We ordered delivery and it took an hour and a half to get to us (mistakes happen), but we'll definitely try them again to hope to put that star back up there.    This is great Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service EVER!  Placed a phone order. Got there and my order was twice as expensive as it should have been. When I inquired as to why the woman insisted that I ordered a large meal. I explained to her that I ordered the lunch portion. A man came from the back and rolls his eyes at the woman and then proceeds to unpack my order. When I asked what he was doing he said I'm going to go back to the back and take some of your food away and give you a lunch portion.   REALLY??  Now I'm late back to the office and they want to take away half my food because of THEIR mistake?  Unbelievable.  I told him I would never be back and I hope you never go there either."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Food is always great & my son loves playing with im guessing the owners children who are always there playing. Great food & quite place to relax."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Very tasty Chinese food. Decent prices.  Fairly fast service. Family owned. What panda express should be."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place, the food is fantastic. Every time I have ordered something from this place I am very pleased by their food.  It is a little hard to understand the people there, but that to me tells me how authentic they really are.  I mean, it's one of those places that they are family run.  You can tell because they have their children there doing homework and helping out some (which they will probably deny because of child labor laws).    I have never eaten there but it's a great takeout place, it seems a bit small for me to eat there with my family.  Another thing that's pretty good about this place is the portion sizes.  They have so much food that you actually have some left over, I mean a lot of food.  Even my wife who doesn't like Chinese food that much said that it's the best place in the east valley."}
{"text":"Wow! Get your delivery on! We had a wonderful family meal tonight brought right to our door, piping hot and mouthwateringly fragrant! Trying to keep with non- glutinous selections, we chose the House Pad Thai Reece noodle and Beef with Black Bean Sauce. Both were flavorful and retained a firm, fresh texture. The meat was tender, the sauce was just right, and the fresh vegetables were still nice and crisply cooked! Our beef dish came with a side of fried rice which was generous... we scarfed it up, but it easily could have been a serving on its own. Our family loves House Won Ton soup, with all four meats (chicken, pork, shrimp, beef), so we ordered that too, and it was a big success!  The textures, colors, aroma, temperature, and flavor were five stars! Plus our delivery guy was one of the nicest people we encountered all day. A great dining experience all around! Ordering again this week for a church lunch event!"}
{"text":"This is the best \"East Coast Style\" Chinese food I have found in the area, and believe me, I have tried several. Wonton soup is fantastic. A large feeds 3 people. There's 10 wonton in a large. The sweet and sour pork is amazeballs. My bf tried the beef lo mein. He loved it. Mmmm, can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This place has the best orange chicken in AZ! I moved to Glendale 2 years ago and this place is still worth the 100 mile round trip drive, even with gas prices on the rise! I hope they grow big enough to expand to the west side."}
{"text":"Love love it here. They are so nice! Good food- heavy yes... so we only get ever so often. But we really enjoy King Wok. Also- they have a great lunch special! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Orange chicken was amazing and kung pao was amazing hot sour soup fresh white rice good best Chinese I've had ever!"}
{"text":"Rude staff - over the phone AND in person.... not sure how this place has stayed in business for as long as they have.  The food is horrible - had left overs and threw them away.  Will not be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome !  The sesame chicken is made just like back home on Long Island ..   So this has now become our go to spot for Chinese my only issue is with the white rice.. I wish it was more wet and sticky ! But it was still good and the serving sizes are just right for the price !   If your around the neighborhood definitely try this place if you are craving good Chinese food !"}
{"text":"Yum! This is yummy NY style Chinese! Their crab rangoons are the best and their shrimp and orange chicken is good too. They are really nice and have a better than average delivery time. 2 thumbs up for this place."}
{"text":"After a long breakfastless morning this place was conveniently next to the store we went to, and we were so hungry that the oily fried Asian food steam coming out of the door smelled like heaven. And we weren't disappointed!  We both got General Tso chicken, one with white, one with pork fried rice, and both came as a combo with an egg roll. We got to go and the food was ready in less than 10 minutes.  The chicken was very good, it was flavorful and dense, not that soft almost mushy chicken that you often get at Asian fast food restaurants. Great sauce, advertised as spicy but not spicy at all (wish it was), pork fried rice wasn't my favorite though because it was too oily. Egg rolls were dry and came without a dipping sauce - that and the pork fried rice is why I took a star off. Service was friendly.   I'd come back again!"}
{"text":"If you just imagine you're in mainland China, this will feel right. Service is a bit strange,  but it's traditional Chinese service. I come for the ever elusive, hard to find chichen chop suey, and I love it !"}
{"text":"Great food, been  getting take out from here for years.  Large portions and reasonable  prices.  There delivery  is fast too."}
{"text":"Open late past 9pm? ? ? Awesome! Cheap prices too.  The food is  acceptable for chinese food. nothing special and the food is ok too.  Its not terrible, food is \"freshly cooked by chinese ppl in the back.  Only real special thing is that its open late, very late.  I get off work later than most ppl and by the time i want to pick something up to eat, most places are closed."}
{"text":"Quick and easy take out Chinese food that delivers. Plan on take out, because all of the tables are always occupied by their kids doing homework, making crafts or practicing their band instruments. They have the yummy red BBQ pork in all of their pork dishes, which is a winner for me. And I love that most dishes you can order large or small, and small is pretty damn big! The kid's fave is their steamed dumplings."}
{"text":"Great foods that satisfied real Chinese.   With the $4.75 lunch special with drink and egg roll. What can you ask for more? It's cheaper than cup of coffee. Great cooker and very friendly restaurant owner.   Tried their lunch twice. Will try their dinner menu later."}
{"text":"It's not the best, it's not the worst. It's NY-style Chinese food, and if that's what you're looking for, then this is a place from which you can procure it. I ordered a few dishes tonight for delivery, and everything was the very definition of A-OK. They forgot to put crispy noodles in, so I called them up and they sent some right over to me, no problem. They also included spicy mustard without my having to ask for it, so that was nice. I enjoyed what I had ordered, because it was exactly what I wanted.   Every once in awhile, you just crave some NY-style Chinese food. You can get it here. Yes, you'll probably feel a little swole afterwards, and yes there's definitely better options, but everything here is fine. Nothing better, nothing worse."}
{"text":"The service isn't great but the food is good. The more you go, the more you will get to know them and they get to know you. :) It's better for take-out. Order over the phone instead of using the online ordering option... Good egg rolls, awesome chicken on a stick, honey chicken and general chicken. You can choose your spice level. Brown rice is available. Their chicken fried rice isn't very good... :/ All in all it's good hole in the wall New York style Chinese food."}
{"text":"They are always very quick on their deliveries. I pretty much get the same thing every time (shrimp fried rice with eggs and crab rangooooooon!) but my husband likes to mix it up. We have yet to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is the only one I've found so far that matches the flavor and quality of the NYC-area Chinese restaurants. Don't miss the boneless BBQ spare ribs or the fried rice. Good prices too, although I wish that their \".... and Broccoli\" dishes had a little more meat and a little less broccoli."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have it delivered or pick it up.  They have some of the best chinese food I have ever eaten.  Don't plan on eating there though, the dinning room is really tiny.  The teriyaki chicken bowl  is my favorite."}
{"text":"The best Chinese you will find in the east valley! Our family orders almost every week. They are always consistent, fast and lots of flavor. Our family loves the combination lo mien, beef and broccoli, crab wonton. My husband loves the dumplings. Everyone's favorite is the sesame chicken. It is amazing! All our friends and family love it as well! Hands down the best!!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and their child about 8 years old  was sitting in the restaurant doing his home work PICKING HIS NOSE! He's not cooking so ok he is a kid. The mother comes out to take our order.......her apron is filthy! Lacking any personality what so ever she takes our order.  Good thing she forgot to bring us our water i was afraid i would have to get something out of the fountian self serve drink station which was filthy too. We get our food and check yelp reviews everyone raves about the food, it was good i have to say. So we are having our lunch and now the husband, just guessing, is sitting behind the counter reading a newspaper and start hacking luggies yes snot sucking and spit in a sink behind the cash register counter! I wanted to puke! There a few people coming in but all to go orders. I used to go packet soy sauce so i didnt have to touch the raunchy soy sauce ."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special online which made it awesome because I hate the language barrier on the phone. For reference their website isn't easily located. It's kingwokmenu.com order online there. Whatever site I used charges the business. She kindly informed me this when I picked up with ZERO attitude. The reviews of rude service are not accurate.   Cheap cheap!  13 bucks for two lunch specials.  Both were delicious, sesame chicken and general tso's. Not soggy and had plenty of sauce.   Bonus just like east coast Chinese!"}
{"text":"We spent years looking for Chinese food that resembled the kind of food we used to eat in NY. Luckily we found this restaurant and were pleasantly surprised when we found out the owners had actually moved to AZ from NY! The staff is always polite and their low mein is delicious!"}
{"text":"We loved the Mongolian beef with noodles and rice. Spicy of course and so tasty! They had speedy delivery too which is a plus if you don't want to drive."}
{"text":"I just love this place to take out!  Best fried rice ever!  I also like the sweet and sour pork because they give you a big bowl of sauce and don't cover your food with it before hand.  It is my goto spot for take out for sure!  You should check this place out if that have not already.  I ate at this place once but I think I will stick to take out."}
{"text":"They have freshly-cooked good food and large portions. We like supporting a friendly family business. Favorites of ours: General Cho's chicken, moo shoo, egg foo young, BBQ ribs. We need to try more dishes, though! Not much in the way of ambience. We'll usually eat in for lunch but get take out in the evenings. Lunch specials are a really good value and opportunity to check this place out for only $5 to $7 including soup or drink."}
{"text":"Brsy Chinese food in Gilbert.  Been coming iver 10 years.  Super great foos and nice family.  Big portions. Love it."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, good prices, good portions and very quick. What else could you ask for from a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. Very happy I found this place !!!"}
{"text":"Horrible! We were looking for a good place for Chinese food, this was not it. The orange chicken was like an everlasting gobstopper. You could not stop chewing it, it never broke down. The Pork fried rice had chunks of refried and refried pork, like flavorless wood chips. The egg flour soup was a gelatinous yellow substance with no taste. The chicken lo mein had a nice burnt taste to it. The egg rolls had been cooked, cooked and boiled again. My family stood around our Chinese bounty, each trying our food and spitting it in the sink. We then had to go out and get a real dinner. Don't stop here you will be sorry"}
{"text":"We've ordered from King Wok 20+ times over the last couple years. Great food, great price. Delivery is FAST and always polite. It's our go-to dinner place when we're too busy to cook."}
{"text":"King Wok is my home away from home. Growing up in San Francisco and eating dim sum every Sunday will make you crave Chinese food often and I am so thankful for King Wok!   King Wok is decently priced, includes large portions and quick delivery! I love ordering from them when I need to fill the craving!   I would highly recommend the Beef Chow Fun, Mongolian Beef, Chicken & Broccoli (make it spicy) and anything with Bean Curd (Tofu dishes).   For the price, convenience and service you can't beat it."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from King Wok for over a year now. The food very good however the service is TERRIBLE. I swear they NEVER get my order right (for take out or delivery). I've given them a year to fix their crappy service so I won't be ordering from them anymore."}
{"text":"Really great food! Delivery was fast and friendly and the food was piping hot right out of the kitchen. Our new local favorite."}
{"text":"I love ordering delivery or take out from this place.  Super fast, inexpensive, delicious, and you get a lot of food for what you pay!  This is the only local place I've found to offer honey walnut shrimp, which I fell in love with at a hole-in-the-wall place in SF Chinatown many years ago. It's a large serving, and doesn't reheat well, but OMG its so freakin' good!  The only thing I've tried and didn't like was the chop suey - it just wasn't what I expected.  It had a lot of sauce and not many crunchy vegetables.  It tasted good, it just wasn't what I wanted at the time.  The dining room is small, and I've only seen people sitting down eating in there once (while I was waiting for my take out). I'd recommend trying them out."}
