{"text":"I had the hankering for some Pad Thai Takeout and was directed to yamis for some delicious food.

I was not disappointed. The food was delivered quickly, it was hot and delicious. I got the pad thai, spring rolls and some spicy soup.

The man who delivered the food was both polite and able to make change quickly.

I would have no problem watering from them again, in fact I'm feeling a bit peckish perhaps I'll give them a call right now."}
{"text":"The most amazing food! I haven't eaten in the place yet (only done take out) but the food is super good and I look forward to a sit down dinner soon."}
{"text":"The staff here are hit and miss. I recently stopped in for lunch one day and in this instant, it was a complete miss.
I asked how long it would be for lunch and the owner(?) went into lecturing me about how I should go to the supermarket if I want to eat something immediately. To be honest, with her rude direction I was debating on it. I had to get back to work so I was genuinely wondering if I had the time to dine-in. I was so close to turning and leaving in that moment but I wanted sushi so I subjected myself to the slow, passive aggressive service that resulted from my honest inquiry.
Their food is satisfactory but they can definitely take a few pointers in the area of customer service."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. Very clean establishmnent. Service was pleasant accurate and quick. Chairs comfortable. (That's not always the case) Yes and I heard the arguing in the back. LOL  I will definitely come back when I am in the area again!"}
{"text":"Great food and good prices but when I went there with my friend he received his food way before me to the point where he ate his whole meal and I was still waiting for mine. Only one server on a busy night at dinner time and what seemed like only one or two cooks!"}
{"text":"Just tried take-out from here this week, very pleasantly surprised at how good it was!!! Ordered the dinner for four, the dishes were diverse and delicious, best I've had in Whitby! I would recommend you have a try, it was a bit more expensive but well worth it and we had tons of leftovers after 5 people ate."}
{"text":"Well order takeout all I can hear was two guys arguing as I order my food got there and still arguing loudly, which in fact they never started making my food so I just left this place sucks for service not sure about the food didn't get a chance to try it what a shame"}
{"text":"This place has to be the biggest surprise of the week for me! Walking in I honestly didn't expect my meal to be that great, but to my surprise it was! I had the Chicken Pad Thai (extra hot) and was blown away with what I received. Unlike other Pad Thai's I have had, this one wasn't too oily nor was it overly salty. The chicken wasn't dry or smelly, it was just right! While service isn't that great (I didn't expect it to be anyways), the trip would be well worth it for some quality food. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a new Asian cuisine restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and fresh tasting. Whatever their doing it's definitely right. If your ever in the Whitby area stop by it will be well worth it."}
{"text":"Really polite staff and fast food food preparation. Love the mobile app for ordering!"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new restaurant in Whitby. They fully renovated the place which is a bonus for me as I enjoy a nice clean ambience. For the value of what you get at this restaurant, it's amazing. The quality is okay but can't complain with the low prices of their items. The service was good as well. I have dined here a few times already and would definitely go back again."}
