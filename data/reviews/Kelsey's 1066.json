{"text":"I'm not a fan of chain restaurant, I find they never have consistency nor good food, but this is THE ONLY chain restaurant I frequent repeatedly. They got me H O O K E D on their \"Big What\" Burger. I'm a burger connoisseur. I've tried every burger under the sun.  This one takes the cake.  Not only do they have the greatest burger I've ever had, they are consistent and all their other options are fantastic. They have suprisingly good calamari, perfectly flash fried. The creamiest spinach dip. Flavorful bruschetta...the list goes on. And to finish, they have delightful desserts too. 
I've tried their pasta, I don't find it's the greatest. Opt for their happy appies, as they call them, and their pub grub food choices. 
I almost forgot to mention, they have deliciously thirst quenching concoctions flying out of the bar.
As for the atmosphere, it's cozy. It's almost always empty. I've never been there when it was full, despite going at peak hours.  You'll be able to enjoy a nice quiet cozy meal. Alone or with company."}
{"text":"At no fault of the one server working the entire restaurant the service was not good. This place is poorly managed clearly. The food was sub-par especially for a chain restaurant where I would normally expect something close to the taste I get at the 3 other locations I have dined at. Should have listened to the other yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Worst service! I will never ever come back to this location! Dirty cutlery, very slow service, app came before drinks..... like learn proper dining edicate!!! I'm giving a 1 because it's the lowest u could choose from! Pathetic!"}
{"text":"I went here for a company lunch today, and I have to say, I was happy with the food here.

I ordered a diet pepsi and the pulled pork sandwich with bbq and mustard on a pretzel bun with cheddar brocelli soup, so good!!

The wings here are great too, nice and crispy. Ive had the burger here and was happy with it too, its juicy and tender.

Service is fast and the lunch menu is super fast to order from. Give it a try."}
{"text":"A group of us went to this location for a late lunch this week and the overall experience was a good one. It was \"all you can eat wings\" day, a great deal for only 17.99. Ask my husband, he will attest to that. The rest of us ate off of the lunch menu. We all ordered different items, including a special request or two, and were surprised all of the food arrived at the same time, piping hot! 
The server we had was great, friendly, funny and efficient.
The cost was pretty much in line with other restaurants of this type. The desserts are good but seem overpriced across the board.
Not exactly in our neighbourhood but if in the area would definitely  go back again....especially for that wings special!"}
{"text":"Kelsey's is a fairly typical restaurant with average food. I often come here when I am craving chicken wings as they have an all-you-can eat special at a fairly decent price. The wings are usually overcooked but they still taste decent (plus, it's hard to notice when you're eating so many so quickly). Service is standard and there aren't really any menu items that I would recommend avoiding."}
{"text":"I've only ever hung out at the bar after stuffing myself silly at Dragon Pearl Buffet. The bartender is always very friendly and quick with the drinks. There are hight tops, booths and the bar to sit at. Decent selection of beers and drinks."}
{"text":"One word: Atrocious!

I only gave one star because I have to give something.

I have never been to a Kelsey's but the menu seemed limited. The service was so so- I barely saw my waiter to begin with. The pepsi was extremely watered down. Like come on? How do you not get soda right? That should of been my first sign! The food? Awful. My boyfriend ordered the baby got back ribs. When they came to the table, they just looked anemic. No BBQ sauce and honestly they looked like they had been put in the microwave. My Chicken Parm was over done and very bland!

Bottom line: There's a McDonalds down the street- you'll be more happy with the food there then in here."}
{"text":"No No. Kelsey's has really gone downhill. The service was kinda strange and the place was completely empty for Monday at 5:00 pm. Food was OK and the wait staff was possibly the 3:30 pm clientele recruited at the last minute to fill-in for the \"C\" team. Not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Come here every now and then if I just want to sit down, relax, have a couple beers, watch some hockey and eat some bar food for dinner if I don't want to cook anything. I've pretty much eaten almost everything on the menu. The food is decent. Nothing to brag about. The beer is cold, the service is good. This is pretty much an average restaurant. Nothing really stands out here. 

I do really like their french onion soup and usually get a bowl as an appetizer before the main course."}
{"text":"I have passed by this Kelsey's several times and finally had a chance to stop by, the restaurant was fairly busy for a Sunday night. Maybe it was because of the special they had that night, 1/2 price burgers. 

The waitress was friendly, but rather forgetful Had to ask a couple of times for a drink. It could be that she was distracted with the larger group of people who were seated in front of us.

The food is average, the menu is simple with burgers, chicken fingers, pasta's and chicken. 

Luckily this location didn't close after all!! It was supposed to close December 20, 2013"}
{"text":"We were in the area of Don Mills and York Mills so we decided to give Kelsey's a try.  We started with the Four Cheese Spinach Dip which was pretty good.  We liked the deep fried pita chips. Portion was quite tiny though - they covered most of it with lettuce, which was a bit odd.  It looked nothing like the picture on their menu.  I had the Messy Fish Sandwich.  Fish tasted fresh, was very crispy. I personally don't like coleslaw on my sandwiches so I just scooped it out.  I found the sweetness mixed with the tartar sauce was a bit much.  We also ordered the Seafood Lover's Pasta.  Shrimp was quite rubbery and the sauce was salty and lacked flavor.  It was also quite greasy.  Service was friendly and very efficient. Typical chain restaurant food."}
{"text":"Worst meal I've had for a while. Nothing was fresh, in the sense that everything had a funky smell to it. From vegetables to meat fish was too based and buffalo chicken was overly salty and spicy and had freezer smell.

Service was slow and lacking."}
{"text":"I think the food was good. I had the chicken with balsamic vinegar sauce, which I thought was very delicious. The service was quite slow though, considering how busy the place was. I only ate here because I had a gift card, however, I would rather go somewhere else for my money."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday (Aug 26/14). Had the \"Fast Lunch Menu\". If that was fast I would hate to see a \"slow menu\" Although the food was adequate the service was terrible. We waited 25 minutes for our lunch to be delivered & the restaurant wasn't even busy. I work close but this was my last visit to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Get your burgers, steaks, pasta, and salads here at Kelsey's! It's such a great environment and this is a pretty cool concept:  Order water, drink it all, & they refill it with a bigger glass. Amazed me!!

{"text":"I'm not the kind of guy who likes to write bad reviews. But I can't believe almost nothing was right in my visit today.
My fiancee and I love Kelsey's. We come here a lot (this location and other locations). We specifically like to come on Thursdays for the half price wings.

Our visit this time was terrible. Let me tell you why.

When we first walked in, we stayed for a really long time at the door waiting to be seated although we were the only people waiting. And that's because no one of the servers was at the door and available to seat us.

After a long wait, a waitress came from the kitchen holding an empty garbage can and placing it under her desk. She looked at us and said \"Hi, table for two?\"
She didn't welcome us. She didn't smile. We're used to \"Hi, welcome to Kelsey's. How are you guys doing today?\" But that didn't happen.
She didn't even apologize for being late and that we were waiting for so long.

She then took us to sit at a middle table. She didn't ask us if we preferred a table or a booth. My fiancee said we prefer a booth. But the server said there would be another 5 minute wait time because they have to clean one for us.
There were many empty booths but none was cleaned.

We sat at a booth after they cleaned one for us. And we ordered two orders of chicken wings and an appetizer of chips and queso.

The appetizer came first with a very very small portion of the queso dip. The portion was so small that if you used 20% of the amount of chips it came with to dip, the dip would finish. And you'll have to eat the rest of the chips with no dip.

The dip was too spicy for my fiancee so she asked our server if they had any other options for dipping sauce and he said no they didn't. He could only bring her ranch dressing.

I then ate some of our appetizer alone with obviously just a fee chips and we had to wait another 30 minutes for our food to come. Which is a really long wait for food at any restaurant.

The wings finally arrived. They weren't hot. Yes I'm serious. The wings were barely even warm. It looks like they made them, added sauce to them, and let them sit for a long time until they would be brought to us. This really bothered me. Who doesn't like their wings hot?

The wings came with celery and carrot sticks. Those were really cold. I'm used to always getting those in room temperature. They shouldn't be hot nor cold. But the veggie sticks were just out of the fridge (or freezer, since our plates have been sitting on a counter in their kitchen for so long)

The server, Rafael, was nice and apologized to us for being late with our food. He explained to us how busy they were and that there weren't enough staff in the restaurant because they didn't expect that many guests on Thursday night."}
{"text":"Of all the places I had eaten at while visiting Toronto for work, it was probably by far the least enjoyable. Slow service, mediocre westernized fast comfort food. They try to be healthy and service salmon salad and sides, however it took over 20 minutes for the waitress to get back to us saying they don't have any salmon. 

Meal was disappointing to say the least. If I could give a 1/2 star I'd do it"}
{"text":"Great place! Fast service! Friendly people!
We came here on a trip to the states to visit family in Toronto and it was very comfortable! They went out of their way to make us happy and full! The food was great!"}
{"text":"It was my First And last dining experience at a Kelsey's. 
I was here with a larger group of co workers and everything from the service , timing of food , lack of water and beverage service had us wanting to just leave."}
{"text":"Like many of the big chain restaurants the menu is standard fare. I wanted a healthy salad and got a flavorless meal I could make better at home. The location needs a good cleaning, faster service and a better product delivered to the customer considering the cost of the meal. Skip this location and look for a local haunt to get a great meal. I won't go back."}
