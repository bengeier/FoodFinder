{"text":"Malgré le lieu un peu chaotique, la bouffe est très bonne. Le sandwich au canard est excellent. La soupe de légume très savoureuse. Par contre carton jaune pour les desserts qui sont decevants. Les gateaux manquent de goût et sont un peu secs. On est un  peu à l étroit pour manger mais on l oublie vite une fois le repas commencé.  Je reviendrais pour les plats et la belle luminosité du lieu."}
{"text":"The food is simple and can be acceptable but not for quality-price.  The service is relatively slow, so it would be wise to order a small appetizer beforehand.


As for the atmosphere, they tried to incorporate the open ceiling concept with modern looks. Some might find it nice, some might find it chaotic."}
{"text":"Bon, la bouffe est délicieuse. Mon grilled cheese est chaud, goûteux, pas trop cher. Là où le bât blessesérieusement, c'est au niveau de l'organisation. Tables tassées, à l'étroit. Cohabitation épicerie et restaurant un peu difficile autant pour le restaurant que l'épicerie. Service chaotique (serveuse qui sert 3 des 4 clients mais qui laisse la 4e assiette sur le comptoir, oubliée par la serveuse, passée à autre chose."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the overall disorderly atmosphere and inventory management, but food cooked on the premises is good, if a bit pricey. Service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after making a wrong turn on our bikes and being too hungry to continue on to our original destination. The location is convenient to the metro and the library. I was confused at first by the food truck tag on yelp, but it turns out they have a food truck in addition to this permanent location.

The prices are quite affordable with good food quality. The waiter was extremely patient with us French illiterate tourists and basically explained the whole menu for us. I ordered the tofu wrap with kimchi, boyfriend got the daily special (bourgette grandola). Food was plated beautifully and filled us up nicely. We each had a bottle of Montreal-made kombucha to accompany our meal. No regrets whatsoever!"}
{"text":"Packed place on weekends it seems, service VERY slow. Menus printed on blackboards, including the day's specials. Inside,the place looks like a reconstructed warehouse/kitchen. Wait staff appeared to be inexperienced and an older woman(proprietor)? had to keep a watchful eye and continuously give instructions. After waiting for 20 minutes, I made sure to flag a waiter, one who'd seen me but kept ignoring me as did the waitress. There were a number of young families and they were served quickly and attentively. Grrrr. The waiter could not tell me what my dish of pain perdu came with or what it really was, it took him another 10 minutes to get back to me, and he was still none the wiser! Not very confidence inspiring! The place kept filling up, patrons could not find a seat, as the place is small, and was overly full. My bowl of cafe au lait arrived 30 mintes later, LUKEWARM, NOT impressed! I was still waiting to be served, FINALLY, the proprietor herself served me, 55 minutes later, with aplogies. I had to flag down (again)the waitress, this time, to let her know my cafe au lait was now icy. She at least brought me another, no charge, again with apologies. The pain perdu was nothing more than 2 slices of sugared bread on top of a  fried/ scrambled ( a hasty job)  egg, with homestyle fried potatoes and 2 slices each of kiwi and orange. It was a treat to just finish, pay up, and leave, apologies or not. Prices comparable to what you'd pay downtown, but without the  expected service  There is also a small bakery/grocery on the premises."}
{"text":"Un chouette endroit dans près du métro Rosemont. 

On y trouve une offre de repas simples, des sandwhichs, salades, pâtes. De bons desserts, du thé, du café. 

L'établissement fait aussi épicerie bio, pratique pour faire quelques courses après son lunch ! 

Idéal pour aller manger entre collègues."}
