{"text":"little disappointed with the food and customer service. I have being going to many Italian restaurants and eat better. Price is average but so as the food. Not recommending it to anyone, Sorry!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. Ordered their daily special, veal scappolini with a lemon sauce on risotto. Tasted pretty gross as if the meat was spoiled. The risotto wasn't too impressive either. The other dish we had was also a veal. It was a bit better but not very satisfying. And then the grilled calamari had no grill marks on it, and no grilled flavour with it either."}
{"text":"Great ambience - dimly lit, live music and classic dining decor.  The clientele seem to be generally more older, affluent folks and the service to match.   The veal chop is great and so was the salmon and pastas.  The location is large enough that you generally don't have to wait long for a table especially for this location on Markham Main Street.   Parking is on the street but they have a back parking lot as well providing ample parking."}
{"text":"I would say avoid this place like a plague. My cup was dirty, not even properly cleaned when they served me water. The waitress came to check up on us quite often but never once asked if I'd like refills for my water even though my cup was empty. She must've been new because as she was naming the daily specials (there were two apparently), she said straight to our faces that she forgot the other. She also doesn't seem to know the menu well. My friend asked for clarifications and she had to look over my friend's shoulder at the menu to basically read off the menu, which didn't help much.  Now talking about the actual food. I ordered the \"4 generation recipe meat balls\" (came with four) because the description made it sound phenomenal. It was so mediocre, the frozen meatballs you buy at Loblaws are probably better. IKEA meatballs are like god sent compare to these. Then I got the 9 layer lasagna and was equally disappointed. Instead of stacking the ingredients in between the layers of pasta, they literally just had 9 super thin layers of pasta pressed together and all the saucing over it in a pool of brown. It looked gross and unappetizing. It wasn't good either; you're better off buying frozen lasagna from Loblaws.  My friend said her grilled calamari appetizer was amazing, however, and that her spicy whine sauce spaghetti with shrimps was equally as good.   I don't know though... Prices are relatively cheap and reasonable (minus the meatballs, $8 for super mediocre and bland meatballs, hmm...) but given  the difference in our experiences, I'll probably never return."}
