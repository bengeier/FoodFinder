{"text":"I could have went my entire life not knowing this restaurant existed, lucky for me my friend knew about this place and we came here on a Thursday afternoon for some dim sum on a budget. 

The restaurant is located in a small Chinese mall in Scarborough; it is a fair sized restaurant with typical Chinese inspired d√©cor that might benefit from a little updating. Nonetheless the mandate here is cheap dim sum so it is imperative that you do not expect any fancy variation of traditional dim sum. At a price point of $1.98 for any sized dish my friend and I decided to share 9 dishes. 

While nothing really blew me away there were some pleasant surprises. The har gow (shrimp dumplings) were quite plump and filled with lots of shrimp, the siu mai was likewise plump and juicy. My favourite dim sum dish is steamed chicken feet and the ones they had at this location were very meaty but could have benefited from a little more black bean. I am a sucker for eggplant so naturally I enjoyed the fried eggplant dish. Other dishes like the fried shrimp wontons, tripe (which had a very strong flavour), beef roll and sesame balls with egg yolk (a dessert dish) were just ok, pretty standard fare. All of our dishes came out hot and seemed to be cooked to order. 

The service was good (I think), the servers did not speak much English so my friend had to use her language skills to communicate with them but they seemed perfectly nice. You will definitely need to come here with some Chinese friends or risk having a difficult time communicating with the staff. 

Overall this place definitely does not have the best dim sum in the GTA and you should not come here expecting the same quality as some of Markham's finest dim sum restaurants. What this place does dish out is some respectable dim sum at a very low price point and there is something to be said for that."}
{"text":"I came here for dim sum with a large group. They open early - 8:30am! On weekends or holidays, try to arrive before 11am to get a good table. It's your typical Cantonese dim sum place with the ladies walking around with food on carts. They can be a little aggressive at times (best answer is to say \"oh we already had an order of those! no thanks!\") but it's just part of the experience. The food and prices are good. I especially liked their beef congee, fried flat noodles with chicken and vegetables, fried tofu, and their steamed veggie dumplings (mind you, I don't really like shrimp which precluded me from trying a lot of the more standard dim sum dishes). The space is quite large and I know people who have organized banquets here -- the set up is good because you can reserve the whole restaurant and everyone has a good view of the head table (and the dragon and phoenix with lighting-up eyes, of course). The location is a bit drab, inside a depressing mall where the stores seem to have very little business."}
{"text":"If you try to impress, don't bring that special someone to Ocean Castle Seafood Restaurant. But if you want to let your date knows how thrifty you are, this is the place to come for dim sum.

$1.98 for all sizes and on top you get 10% off!! 

Dim sum selections are quite standard but all the ones that we tried were decent. 

Good place for a cheap dim sum fix and they are serving dim sum from 8:30 am to 4 pm!

There are other specials offers including a whole lobster for $9?!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for dinner if you're looking fine Chinese cuisine! It's a seafood restaurant so you'll be able to get a selection lobster and fish, they even had oysters on the menu.

The restaurant is as large as a banquet hall and is often used as such for special occasions and celebrations like weddings or birthdays. I'll expect this place to be fully booked on Chinese new year weekend. So if you're looking to dine here during that weekend, make a reso well in advance.

The food is cooked very well, as you will see in the photos, peking duck, lobster, chicken and fish is a must. We ordered some fried oysters which were tasty as well.

The braised pork hock dish was quite unique and fall-off-the-bone tender. I'd recommend getting this.

Overall this is a great place for gatherings of 5 or more people, which will make the full 10-course set meals more reasonable. The ambiance is nice, elaborate, clean, and bright. Service was polite and friendly. Food was tasty and immensely fulfilling!"}
