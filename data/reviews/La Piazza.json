{"text":"I usually only come here to play cornhole on Thursday nights so I spend most of my time in the parking lot drinking $9 buckets of beer. 

Here's the quickies: 
The chicken parm pizza is absolutely phenomenal, in fact I'm drooling as I type this. All of the pizzas are really good. 

It's a Chicago bar, and if you like baseball it's a Sox bar, sorry Cubbies. 

The bar tenders are pretty hot. 

The owner, Joe, is a pretty nice guy. 

It's one of the few places in town with a shuffleboard.

At Main and Washington, this place is in da 'hood. (1 star deduction)"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Bad hospitality.  When you first enter the restaurant, it feels akward and uncomfortable. Nobody seats you. this of course is not the dealbreaker. After an experience with a female bartender I came across (didnt ask her name white/spanish w black/ brown hair), i will never step foot again in the restaurant because of terrible service and rude staff. the bartender i was dealing with had messed up a previous order that I placed a few hours before. (She charged the wrong credit card with someone else) When I placed my second order she realized that she messed up previously. she tried to be smooth and charge me for the previous order she had messed up on. After I agreed to pay for the previous meal she messed up on, I had asked to speak with front desk, manager, or anybody who was in charge (in order to make sure I wont be double charged) before I took out my credit card. her response was \"it has nothing to do with them\". Which only makes me believe that she wanted to cover up her mistake so her employers wont find out.  After she refused to get a manager or contact front desk, her comment was \" I wont argue with you, we will charge u regardless of who you talk too\" in a rude tone. I left upset and walked out with no food from la piazza. After this whole experience, I will not eat here again simply due to disorganization, awful customer service, carelessness and rude staff. Whereas this could have been a simple problem to fix if she just called over her manager when asked.  GOOD FOOD DOES NOT EQUALIZE RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  food was okay, nothing to brag about. I will now go out of my way to find another restaurant before I concider eating here. This bartender who was working the night of 9/19 should be reevaluated for her unprofessional performance. Blaming customers for staff mistakes is unacceptable. The one question that I really cant figure out is, how can you possibly charge a customers meal to someone elses credit card? Of course this bartender made sure that her manager would not answer this to me.  This just goes to show how much these employees value their job"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Had lunch around 12 and took forever to take our orders. Becky was our waitress and took forever to give us our bill and once we paid took forever to get it back. Long time waiting for drink refills as well"}
{"text":"Preaty good chill place to eat food is Preaty good had the thin pizza with BBw wings and a regular cheeseburger everything tasted great the environment is good and calm would definitely come back"}
{"text":"wouldn't have eaten here if work didn't get me a room in the best western this was adjoined to... the food's actually pretty good... the chicken parm was good and the service is on point... theyre not sheisty with the tuna salad when it comes to the sandwich... 

when youre done eating, go to the bar and order a drink from the hottie bartender... they even have a cigarette vending machine... i don't smoke but fuck it... i think smokers would appreciate that..."}
{"text":"Per word of mouth from coworkers this placed is closed as of 2/8/2016. Sad because the food and service was top notch."}
{"text":"I don't eat pizza outside of Chicago, its a waste. This pizza proved me wrong. Still craving it. It was delicious. Sad to say it beat out my favorite pizza in Chicago. Coming back for more!"}
{"text":"--- English ---
Located out of the strips, very nice place to eat. The manager/waiter is very nice (and that's one of the best quality of this job). Make sure that he's gonna do all his possible to make you spend a good time and will make you feel comfortable and happy! The food is really good too! I only tried the pizza but I bet that the rest of the menu is also that good! 
If I need to find a place to eat outside of the jungle of Vegas I know where I will go! 

--- Français ---
Situé en dehors du \"Strips\", très bon endroit pour manger. Le gérant/serveur and vraiment super gentil (et c'est bien l'une des meilleures qualités de ce travail). Soyez certain qu'il fera tout son possible pour vous faire passer un agréable moment et il saura vous mettre confortable et souriant. La nourriture est vraiment très bonne aussi. Je n'ai qu'essayé que la pizza mais je parie que le reste de la carte est tout aussi bonne! 
Si j'ai besoin de trouver un endroit pour manger hors de la jungle de Las Vegas je sais où j'irai!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch a Bears game because they play all Chicago sports.The place has a lot of potential but is kinda missing the boat. Totally understaffed making the service terrible. As for food, Italian beef was wonderful but the BLT was not. Best thing about it was the bacon but yuck tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce ruined the sandwich. If they can improve on things it would be a fun place to watch football."}
{"text":"La piazza.  This is my second time to this establishment.  First time ordering food.  I was completely unimpressed.  I was staying in the attached hotel.  Clean spacious rooms reasonable prices.  Neighborhood is a little sketchy.  On to the Resturant.   I absolutely love the Chicago themed bars and food.  So two stars for the theme and excellent portrayal.  If I were a local I would frequent this bar.  I ordered a philly cheese steak and my girlfriend had the lasagna.  The guy who took my order was cool as hell.  (Bald guy, Jeffrey I think).  My sandwich was ok.  My girlfriends lasagna was either a mistake or some ones culinary misfire.  The meat sauce very odd.  To me it tasted like a chili con carne.  Just beanless chili.  Pack full of noodles.  Not your traditional Italian lasagna.  She was so disappointed she wanted to take it back.  I talked her out of that I personally felt that it wasn't a kitchen mistake and more of a recipe failure.   So i give it 3 stars because i like the atmosphere and concept but I feel the menu could use a little work."}
{"text":"Bonne cuisine italienne classique, au cur du quartier résidentiel Bois-Franc. Bon rapport qualité/prix. Service parfois lent si la salle de réception d'à côté est occupée."}
{"text":"This is the only place in Vegas that has deep dish pizza worthy of being called Chicago Style.  Forget Bj's and Chicago Brew Co.  If you can eat deep dish with your hands and skip the knife and fork,  it's not authentic.
The pizza is thick, crispy and swimming in a deliciously spicy red sauce.
The rest of the food is good, but the main draw here is the pizza for sure.

I talked to the staff last time I was visiting and they claimed that the original chef kept the recipe a secret and took it with him when he left.  I honestly couldn't tell the difference.  It was just as amazing as I remember.  

One note though...
It takes a while to cook (over 30 minutes), so it might be a good idea to call ahead."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! We were looking for something to eat near Cashman Center and yelp showed that this was close. A basic bar restaurant with great prices, good service, and great food. I had a meatball sub that was delicious! Crusty bread, homemade meatballs, lots of melted cheese. It was perfect."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Italian sandwich I have ever had.  The smell lingered in my mustache for hours, making me want to gag all day.  I have no clue what it tasted like.  It was almost like seeing a new color, but a color that blinds you.  \"Rancid\" would be the adjective I would use to describe the taste."}
{"text":"I'm giving Joe and La Piazza 5 stars.
Great food...great vibe...and great staff.
I grew up in Chicago and this was seriously some of the best pizza I've had in a very long time.
You guys ROCK!!"}
{"text":"Nice looking place. Had high hopes based on reviews - tomatoes were tasteless and pasta tastes like something you'd expect to have at a cage aux sports...gnocchi out of a can and tortellini dry. The pieces of lamb in between were decent though. Not recommended. 

Update: the manager called us to follow up on our experience and invite us to try it again. Updated the ratings to 3 stars for the service until I get the chance to eat there again."}
{"text":"This place is good, but beware it is not within safe walking distance to downtown Vegas.  The restaurant is located inside a Best Western lobby and served standard Italian fare.  Inside the decor is not excellent, but really, in this part of town what more can you expect?
My fiancee and I both had their seafood alfredo, and it was excellent.  It combined clams, crab and shrimp and was a good value considering the amount of seafood on the plate.  The serving also came with a salad or soup, and while my salad was lacking, my fiancee's beef vegatable soup was delicious.  It was fresh made there, with generous portions of beef roast and stewed vegetables.
There was a full bar inside the restaurant too, with video poker and several big screen TV's.  Service was good, if not a bit overbearing, but that can be understandable because of the few people eating at the time I was there.  All in all, a good place for the money, and if you are in the area check it out."}
{"text":"Good food however the service is hit or miss. I went with a group of friends on a weekend and we were one of the only tables however our entire stay took about 1.5 hours and we had to chase down the waitress!  However going today at the lunch rush we were in and out within 40 minutes!   It's not in the best part of town, but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"I have a hard time expressing my gratitude to Joe and the staff at La Piazza for making our weekend in Vegas SO much easier! I was travelling with a group of 40 high school kids and assorted parents. I needed lunch for 60 at the Cashman Center. I called La Piazza Friday morning to see about getting pizzas. Without going in to details, Joe and his staff delivered lunch to us for two days, offered extras, checked back to make sure we were ok, the food was great, and we were under budget! We had pizzas one day and pasta the other. Apparently, the garlic knots are yummy. I wouldn't know because they got eaten every day before I had a chance to take one!
They work HARD and want to make sure you get what you expected. I definitely recommend La Piazza!"}
{"text":"La Piazza is located off the strip and in a quiet part of downtown. Owned by a former Chicagoan, Joey offers a very friendly atmosphere and on Sunday he bar turns into a Bears family event. 5 he's in the bar and 1 in the restaurant.  Good food...good prices"}
{"text":"The wife and I came here for pizza (based on Yelp reviews) before seeing the president and Katy Perry last night.  The Chicago style pizza was OK.  It's not the best ever, but not terrible.  I would usually give this place 3 stars, but Tara, our server (and the bartender) was amazing!  The salads were great (super simple but yummy) and the place is just cool.  I wouldn't call it a dive bar, but it has its regulars and we were still welcomed.  We will go back.  We will eat pizza, but it won't be the Chicago style (we've both had much better, though not in Vegas) because the regular pie just looked amazing. I gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Upscale family friendly Italian resto with very nice decor and excellent service. Good size portions. The food has never disappointed. A great idea when you want to get together with friends or family but don't want to cook."}
{"text":"really a great surprise!  not located in the best part of town, but the place is awesome!  the pizza was probably the best I've had in Vegas.  Prices were fantastic!  great place for a large group.  We had a party of 8 and were able to sit together and enjoy our food.  Ordered the chicago style deep dish, takes about 25 min to make.  But amazing!   It was a great price too!  around $60 for a party of 8 for 2 pizzas, beers, and apps.  Highly reccommend!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and this was my first time eating here. I had the meatball sandwich with fries and my boyfriend had the pizza slices with garlic knots.  Being from Chicago I had high hopes for the food but we both thought the food was ok nothing spectacular.  The meatballs on my sandwich were good but unfortunately the marinara sauce that accompanies them was not that good very blah not much flavor. The pizza slices were thin crust (yes Chicago does thin crust) but unfortunately not crispy looked more like a New York floppy slice when you picked it up with less grease, and again the sauce was very blah.  They were supposed to come with garlic knots but instead came with garlic bread sticks. The bread sticks were ok your standard ones was hoping for knots with real garlic butter and pieces of garlic. The place doors look like it would be good to come and watch a Chicago game."}
{"text":"A great place.  Cozy yet big enough to accommodate large groups. There is a full bar (liquor and beers on tap) with TVs to catch multiple games.  The staff was very friendly and check back for refills.  The pizza was outstanding, great food quality, the chicken alfredo was a must order.  

We had a football game nearby and had a group of over 80 people 20 of those were kids under 12 years old.  We called ahead a couple of days prior and \"Joe\" set everything up for us.  He fed all us in a timely manner and the kids loved the food as well.  We will be back.  So if you are with the guys,  family,  or group add this restaurant to your top 5 places."}
{"text":"Last couple of times coming here for my favorite steak sammich was disappointing. The quality was just not there. I'm so sad. I gave'm like three more chances. The last chance was not the business. Soon after, I was not feeling right. Bubblegutitis in my near future. At least I gave them a few more chances. I had to write an update because a few friends wanted to check it out. If you do come through, their other cafe plates are solid. I'd pass on the steak sammich. Their breakfast isn't bad either. Then again, how can you mess up breakfast...

ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"It doesn't matter if you are from the east coast, west coast, or anywhere in between; La Piazza knocks the ball outta' the park. And how could you not like a place named after the greatest hitting catcher of all time!?

Mike Piazza's hall of fame issues aside, I hit up La Piazza after catching the Mets play the Cubs at Cashman Field. Reluctant to walk into a Chicago bar in my David Wright jersey, I was invited by some friendly Met fans I met at the game. La Piazza consists of a standard bar area complete with gambling machines and a dining area. The place appears to be adjoined to a hotel, which is great if you find yourself a little too sauced to drive home after spending time at the bar.

We grabbed a few beers at the bar first and discovered that the bartenders were on their game and extraordinarily friendly. We then took the party to the dining area and put our food order in. We went for a bucket of well done wings, plain sicilian pizza pie, and a sicilian topped with all sorts of protein. I typically don't order my wings well done but these turned out pretty tasty. The pizza itself was not much to look at upon first glance, but after I took my first bite, I was sold. I hadn't had pizza this good in quite awhile. The cheese pizza with no frills was decadent. The quality of the cheese and the toppings on the meat pizza was very evident. The meatballs and pepperoni were phenomenal. You could tell that La Piazza does not cut corners when it comes to their pizza.

During our meal the owner came out and made sure we were doing well which was a nice gesture and much appreciated."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience dining here with a large group; would not return.

As part of a large group, I expected some delay/complications with the service compared to, say, dining with a party of three or four.  The wait times here for ANY kind of service, however, were ridiculous!  And they managed to screw up several of our orders on top of it...

I was looking forward to getting some breakfast late on a Sunday morning only to find that it was no longer available; disappointing but whatever.  So I ordered coffee, water, and a tuna melt.  I got ONE fill on the coffee; no refills were ever offered.  To get a refill on the water, I eventually had to take my glass into the bar because that was never offered either.  My tuna melt, when it finally arrived, was 'ok' at best, and the fries that accompanied it were cold.  My friend who had only ordered a side of fries was left waiting for her order without any comment from the server well after mine had been served, only to find out (eventually) that her order had never been placed.  Getting our checks (everyone was on a separate ticket) so we could get the hell out of this place was taking forever too; eventually we had to line up at the kitchen door (??) to slowly and carefully explain what each of us had ordered.  The bathroom was mess, too.  Couldn't get out of this place fast enough."}
{"text":"I ordered about ten o clock or so. The lasagna was absolutely gross. Not enough meat and that sauce tasted like chili. I've had a lot of lasagna over the years and love it but that sauce was NOT Italian. My boyfriend wasn't thrilled with his food either. If I'm ever in Vegas again I won't order here...even if everyone says the pizza's amazing."}
{"text":"Local or tourist-- you'll love this place. It's like the Cheers of downtown Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It states they deliver, so I called to see if they'll deliver to the D. The guy who answered said no, they don't deliver. I brought up how on the website it states they do deliver. He says oh that's only for big orders and business between 11am-2pm. You should change your info so it's not misleading."}
{"text":"I didn't expect this restaurant to be so good. Waiter was superb and so was very reasonably priced menus. Outstanding pizza crust, great pasta dishes, hot buns, great apps and desserts, I will return."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been going here for 15 years. always something new on the menu, and the owner is awesome. being from Chicago this is my kinda town!!"}
{"text":"Just okay. We ordered the Sicilian pizza with pepperoni. They cut it into squares rather than slices which wasn't a good idea. The wait for 2 small pieces of garlic bread took at least 15 minutes. Service was slow even to get refills on soda."}
{"text":"Chicago style bar. Great food and good drink specials during games. All the food that I've had here is amazing and cooked fresh. None of that frozen stuff like so many other bars do.  The steak was cooked perfectly in the steak special and the meat was extremely tender.  The wings are great. The chicken fried steak is out of this world. Never had anything bad here.  The location is kinda sketchy but there's nothing that can be done about that."}
{"text":"There was a cornhole competetion going on when we got there. Clean, good pizza and calzones. Bucket of beer for $10. Not bad all around, but might question heading into that part of town at night."}
{"text":"I've only had the pizza and it's pretty good.  the crust is crispy and the sauce, cheese and toppings complement it well."}
{"text":"The exterior is quite deceiving since this is part of a motel. The food is actually very good. I had the Chicken Caesar Salad. The chicken was moist and the dressing wasn't overpowering. It was a good call. I only wish it came with some type of bread. Eh, I could have asked for some.... Maybe next time."}
{"text":"This could be my new favorite bar in Vegas. It is in an iffy part of town but there is a private fenced lot. I came here for a City of Las Vegas Corporate Challenge shuffleboard event. This is the only bar in Vegas i have been to with shuffleboard. They also have cornhole in the parking lot on Thursdays. I had a bucket of beer for $9. And they had Blue Moon on tap for $3. they also have Chicago style pizza for less than $15 for a large one topping. The staff was super friendly. The place was also very clean. I really cannot think of anything negative about this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Who would have thought the best Chicago-style deep dish pizza in the valley would be at the bar to a Best Western on North Main? A third of the small was more than a meal and definitely the best I found in a dozen years of looking in Las Vegas. Managed to preserve the left overs to enjoy once I got back home.

I once asked a waiter at Chicago Brewing that had recently arrived from Chicago where to get good pizza in town. He said theirs wasn't awful, but to get good Chicago pizza, you had to drive down to Trop, turn left, go a ways, turn right, .... and get on a plane bound for O'Hare."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. First of all we checked in America best value inn next to this pizza place. I thought they server free breakfast so I asked the front desk \"do you guys server breakfast\" she said \"yes we do next to this room\" . Well everyone will assume that it is free so we sat in one lady approach us and ask us to order. Then I thought it's not free you know and then I asked her \"is it free breakfast from hotel?\" . She said \"no nothing is free here \" in rude way possible. I asked that America inn hotel front desk lady the breakfast is not free then she said in very rude way not every hotel have breakfast. I told I agree that but you should told have us that it is not free. She started arguing with me . Damn it I got early for this breakfast and for good morning day. But she ruined it and the worst service ever. Do not check in this restaurant or this hotel. Both are worst."}
{"text":"Nope nope nope...
Pizza was nasty! I'm only giving this 2 stars because I had a philly cheesesteak that was to die for!!!! ..... but other than that.... nasty."}
{"text":"This place is great! My friend and I are former Chicagoans and heard this was a Chicago place. The bar has lots of chi sports on the walls and a huge regulation size shuffleboard. I can see this being a great place to watch Blackhawks and Bulls already!

We sat in the dining area and got to meet the owner Joe, who was a super nice guy. The dining area is very comfortable and they have a nice menu selection. They serve breakfast lunch and dinner and serve food til 11pm. 

Chicken Milanese with twice baked potato, veggies and garlic bread was the special and my friend enjoyed it very much. She's Italian and all I heard were compliments on the food. 

I went for the pizza. They have three kinds, thin, Sicilian and Chicago deep dish. The thin crust is more like the thickness of a hand tossed pizza. The Sicilian is supposed to be double that thickness and deep dish is, well you know what deep dish is, don't you? 

I ordered a 10\" thin cheese with black olives (my fav). See my picture. It was delicious and perfectly cooked. I had to take most of it home as it was quite filling. I really like the cheese they use. 

It's not far from main st casino- it doesn't look like much from the outside but don't let that fool you. 

Check it out when you're in the downtown area!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! On top of great Italian food, this place serves good ol fashion deep dish pizza with any toppings you can ask for. A tad off the strip but well worth the trip if you're looking for some great pizza. Open late, sports bar right next to the restaurant. Not the best looking joint, but it's clean and the food makes up for the rest of it."}
{"text":"Small little laid back place. Friendly service & atmosphere. Chicago themed.. Even better! Good pizza & good deals. Place was kinda smokey.. I could do without that."}
{"text":"I found this bar /restaurant through a friend.  The people here are terrific and go out of their way with service.  the Chicago style \"italian\" food is great , and the daily specials are always terrific.  Great place to watch a game or hang out with friends.

Try the small thin crust pizza with sausage, the cheese is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Not hip, not trendy, not funky fresh, not the flava of the week, but the pizza here is some of the best I have had in Vegas. La Piazza is located in the unlikely location of a Best Western Hotel. I have not ventured past the pizza here, so no opinion on the rest of the menu. Vegas, the other windy city where most of the pizza blows, offers La Piazza, where you will discover an outstanding thin crust pie....not New York Style. I'm really not sure what kind of pizza category it would fall under. The crust is thin, and crisp, and can handle a kitchen full of toppings without going limp. They also offer up a Chicago style deep dish pie that is also pretty rockin'. I'm not saying it's the best by Chicago standards, but you would be hard pressed to find a better Chicago style deep dish pizza here in Vegas. Rosati's being up there for the Chicago style too. My biggest problem with the place is trying to decide on the thin crust or the deep dish. Staff is friendly, place is clean, the neighborhood will be a turn off for those that have been coddled in life, but it's not THAT bad really from a safety standpoint. To walk there from Fremont and Main St. Is really no problem, it's not a scenic stroll though. If you're looking for a scene or to be seen, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for some pretty rockin' pies in the \"other\" windy city that is Las Vegas, La Piazza will hit the spot."}
{"text":"Went for the bears packers game. Left at halftime    ... Becuase the bears were losing by 42!   Server was a nice guy.  Place was rowdy.. But what do you expect from bears fans.   Pizza was super cheesy mmmm   Pizza was average but still tasty.  Tight space due to all the fans cramped up in one room, but was still a good time!   Pizza deal was 7.77 for a 12 inch 3 topping. So the bill was nice! A bit smokey.    Im used to no smoking in buildings in Chicago"}
{"text":"great service. if your Chicago sports fan looking for a spot to watch your teams game you could do worse than this place"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves Chicago style Italian food. I have been a regular customer since 2005, great Pizzas you can customize with your choice of toppings. Food is good and yes their Kitchen is very clean, the bar is a fun place to be. Bar is open 24/7 and if ou sit there long enough you will meet caste of characters all funnier than hell. Bartenders and servers are very nice and service is prompt. Prices are moderate and you will have a great casual time."}
{"text":"Food is good especially for the price, and the drinks are cheap. It's probably the best pizza in town. If you get a chance to checkout jeff's juicy Lucy special, it's a must. Cheese stuffed between two burger patties, topped with egg, sautéed mushrooms, pickles, tomatoes, lettuce, and more deliciousness."}
{"text":"I read a lot of good reviews on this place before deciding to order.  I am not sure what happened the day I got my pizza, maybe the cook quit and the cashier had to step up to make the pizza.

I got a pepperoni pizza to-go and when I got home and opened the box I could tell immediately it was not cooked even half way through.  Cut into a slice and the crust was completely raw on the inside!  How could this happen, I could tell it was raw by looking at the outside of the crust, why couldn't the person who cooked it tell.  The crust was completely white and gooey in the middle, not golden brown.  

I decided I am already home, not going to take it back and have them remake it.  Tried to finish the cooking process in my oven.  The pizza was not good even after I finished cooking the crust."}
{"text":"For years, I have been driving by this place and wondered about it. I always figured \"It can't be good\" but never thought past that. Well, about a year ago, I asked a friend who lived nearby and he said that he had never gone their either. I said \"Tonights the night\". We went and were were pleasantly surprised. It is non-smoking while the kitchen is open (approx. 8am to 11pm). I said we have to come back for a full meal. When we came back we ordered the Chicago Style deep dish pizza- so GOOD-their sauce rocks! We have been coming back every week since then. Tonight we found out that it is closing after the Super Bowl on February 7. NOOOOOOOO! We will have to come here ore than once a week."}
{"text":"JUST SAY NO! This place is up the street from my job in a bad neighborhood. The food is SOOO bad. I have ventured here a few times under lunch bunch pressure only to be reminded that there is NO reason to serve this food to humans! Once I had a lump of lettuce that came over on the Mayflower in my salad. Another time the re-fried beans looked more recycled than re-fried. This makes me want to find a real dive to upgrade to! I can only imagine the cockroach poker parties that go on in that kitchen."}
