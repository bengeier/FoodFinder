{"text":"Checked on yelp and saw this place so we stopped for lunch. Was just passing through town and we had a very delicious lunch. Very authentic and many choices of sauces. Friendly staff and a clean atmosphere"}
{"text":"small cozy place. homeade tortillas. fresh tasty salsa bar. good food. fast service."}
{"text":"Friendly service.  I had a Carne Asande burrito wet.  I will call this converted drive in as average for Buckeye.  It is not a place to go out of your way to eat.  Still looking for a genuine 4 or 5 star Mexican restaurant in the Buckeye area."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. No lo recomendo porque solamente estan parados y duran media hora para dos tacos."}
{"text":"This place is good.  The 5 mini tacos are great.   The carne aside and pollo asada are good."}
{"text":"Slooooow service...I'm talking snail level 20-30 minutes to get your food. I wouldn't mind if the food was worth it.  IF it's great tasting and leaves me hoping I can swing by again real soon - then I'll gladly wait and still give a good review. Trust me, average tasting food at best. Don't get me wrong, I have the three strikes you're out view when it comes to bad reviews for a restaurant. This one hit it - three times in a row slooooow snail level to get my food and the food was not worth that 20+ minute wait each time. Average tasting food items as the day is long."}
{"text":"I don't know why they have bad ratings. Best Mexican in this area. Mini carne asada tacos are yummy. Good prices and I always get my food fast."}
{"text":"The workers are VERY nice. We go here a couple of times a month. My favorite are the carne asada mini tacos, but I've had very good quesadillas, chips, salsa, and guacamole as well. Prices are reasonable and food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"We've tried several dishes at Ramiro's. Favorites are: cheese enchiladas, carne Asada fries, chiles rellenos, chorizo plate. Lived them all!  The place usually has several Spanish speaking couples there each time I go. Don't let the decor-or lack of decor- scare you away. It is clean and delish."}
{"text":"We usually get breakfast burros every week. Our favorites are red chili, chorizo quesadilla, chorizo and the carne asada is pretty solid to!"}
{"text":"Came here because I had an Entertainment coupon. They told me they couldn't honor it because they had no internet?????"}
{"text":"Overall Stars say it all, just your avg dump. I always yelp the good spots, it happen to be Sunday and a lot of places were closed and I was starving. When I walked in and no one was there, I knew was gonna be bad, I don't recommend by any means"}
{"text":"Now I remember why I stopped coming here.  It takes FOREVER to get your food.  I realize it's a small kitchen with one guy back there but for 3 orders (2 ahead of me) it shouldn't take 25 mins.  Foods decent but I'll head to Frederico's on Cave Creek any day over this place."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! Don't go there!!! The sauce was spoiled and we notified the \"manager\".

The Manager said he would give us our money back- so my husband and i went to sit and finish dinner-

when we were done we went to the register and asked him for the money and he said- the taco we had had the same sauce and chicken- that why did we eat that and not complain.  

he didnt give us our money back nor did he give us our burrito...

THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!

SUCKS REAL BAD- I HATE IT!!!"}
{"text":"We've been here at least a dozen times before writing a review. We've always had fast service and the food is good. The homemade salsas are also amazing! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"They charge .35 cents to your total if you are paying with a card AND if you decide to come here I'd suggest you order your drinks with NO ice, they rip you off by filling your cup all the way to the rim with ice so you're only getting a few gulps. Refills are 72 cents =/ Definitely not the way to treat your customers! The food is whatever, I'd rather go to taco bell haha. Neverrr again."}
{"text":"If i'm craving Mexican food this is my go-to place. The food is great but the atmosphere is definitely strange in there. Always get to go..."}
{"text":"Food is hit or miss. The food usually isn't fresh. The service is slow. 
If you want delicious Mexican food that is fresh go down to 30th st and bell and try Fuego Taco Shop."}
{"text":"The Carnitas are very good!"}
{"text":"The service was deadpan but otherwise okay.   I got simple food..taco and tostada.   It was as good as the next place but I thought a little pricey ($10 with drink),  considering how plan the place is and they are even stingy with the napkins.  Why not go to Chipotle for that price?"}
{"text":"We just had dinner from here. It was absolutely disgusting. There was NO chicken in the chicken tacos or chicken quesadillas. They just put a bunch of lettuce and peppers in it to make it seem like you're getting a lot. Do NOT eat here!"}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and loved it. I've been looking for decent Mexican food since I moved to Arizona and this is by far the best I've eaten. Most of the previous reviews say they're super slow but it was no slower than anywhere else where everything is made fresh upon ordering. 6 other people came in while we were eating and I don't think anyone had to wait more then 5-10 minutes for their food. Delicious. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Driving in the area and hungry, I decided to give this place a try for lunch.  I looked at the menu on the wall and decided to order:

Carne Asada Burrito, $5.59

Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito, $2.98

The service here was brutally slow.  The lady working the cash register could not multitask....it was agonizing.

While waiting for my food, I went to the Salsa Bar to load up on Salsa.  Since I like spicy Salsa, I went for what appeared to be the spiciest one...turned out to be watered down, mild Gringo Juice...*bleh*.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix?select=VxCnEw9so_M2z8KJR1-vBw#VxCnEw9so_M2z8KJR1-vBw

The food came out after a long wait.  Customers were confused because the cashier was calling out the wrong orders and people were returning saying it wasn't what they ordered.  By this time, there were 8 or 9 of us waiting...it was a hot mess in there.

I went for the Carne Asada Burrito first.  I took one bite and didn't like it...it was way too salty.  The Burrito was all Meat & a little Guac/Salsa combo...no Rice or Beans...that's a common recipe in some of these Taco shops.  Since there wasn't any other ingredients to soften the salty flavor, it was just bad.

Next, I went for the Beans/Rice/Cheese (BRC) Burrito.  I took one bite and that one was bland.  I don't know if my taste buds were shot from the salty Carne Asada Burrito, but it wasn't good either.

The Salsa wasn't *meh* too and couldn't save it for me.  Towards the end of my meal, I noticed a guy speaking in Spanish to the cashier lady...she goes to the back and comes out with a couple of cups of \"spicier\" Salsa that was hidden in the back...dammit!  Secret menu I guess....

There are too many other good places in town, I won't be back here.

{"text":"The best thing about the burrito was the tortilla. I think I read on the menu they make them there and it was definitely fresh and really good. However, and though it was stuffed full, the meat wasn't that tasty. It had almost a pre-made/canned taste to it (though it obviously wasn't by texture) that just made the burrito weird tasting and kind of disappointing. I liked that it had guacamole, though. Could have used some cheese and/or sour cr√®me though.

The tacos were shredded beef with just lettuce and cheese. The shells were also really good. The beef was a little fattier than I'm used to but it was good. Definitely worth the $1 price tag, but I wouldn't pay much more.

Overall, a decent lunch that left me with some to eat later for under $7. Beats having to eat at Taco Bell, for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place. The employees are wonderful and the food is great. I've tried to get something different each time I go, and everything I have had so far has been really good!"}
{"text":"We yelped this restaurant and decided to give it a try. we both had the Angus Carne Asada burrito meals. This was a huge and very tasty burrito and I especially liked the beans and rice too. Drinks came with the meal and for 20.00 I'm betting we will return. The waitress/cashier was very friendly and helpful in our decision making."}
{"text":"Ramiros is a very convenient place to go grab some food late because its open 24 hours. For all you people upset about it taking so long to get your food, here's a tip- USE THE DRIVE THROUGH! They prioritize the drive through guests and you will get your food in less than 5 minutes. Also, I only ever eat the breakfast burritos- I agree that some of the meat might be a little strange so stick with the egg and ham burrito. Oh and definitely get lots of the green sauce, its awesome! Hope this helps for the future."}
{"text":"5 Mini tacos can't go wrong for $5! It's a deal. I love the lunch special for $5.99 with a free 20oz soda. Well I still continue to like this place. The food is amazing and the service is great! Finger licking deliciousness!"}
{"text":"I was really craving chilaquiles but can't seem to find any in this small town...went to Ramiro's and was going to settle for one of their amazing burritos BUT then I took a chance and asked if they had chilaquiles. She told me no but she will ask the cook. The cook ended up making me some delicious chilaquiles just like mom's. This fast food joint is better than most Mexican restaurants in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I ate a shitload of breakfast burritos from this place.  I'd recommend the Machaca.  They're only like $4 and it's pretty massive.  I'd say go with the green sauce though the red sauce isn't that bad.  Their chilaquiles were pretty good too but different to what I'm used to.  They were more like wet tacos than actual chilaquiles.  The place itself is sort of small and with not much to offer.  I'd say, get it to go.  Ask for a large cup for the green sauce."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food around. Customer service is outstanding. I reccomend this place to everyone who loves good food."}
{"text":"I don't know what those other reviews are about... this place was awesome.  Sure the building is a dump, and the service isn't great, but the food is absolutely delicious. Authentic Mexican food and it's cheap.  Great salsa too.  I recommend the Carne Asada tacos- 5 for $5.  Great deal and delicious.  Haven't tried anything else but these were so good."}
{"text":"So I've come here multiple times. I think the only reason I come here is for the Horchata drink to be honest because it's made by a machine (not them). They take FOOOREEEVVVERRRR to get my food. This is supposed to be fast food. Quick! I'm not in a full service restaurant that I have to wait 20 minutes for my food. The place in the kitchen is a dump. I know since they leave the door open on my way to the restrooms (which you should stay away from). Chemicals next to prep table (near food!!!)  NO BUENO!  Meat was sitting out in the back. I'm not sure how long that was there. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.

 They have terrible, terrible service. It is always a girl with no uniform wearing regular unprofessional clothing . I'm not judgmental, but she has bracelets and rings on. When you work in food service, you are NOT allowed to have jewelry anywhere near your hands. She could pass on germs and bacteria from the jewelry onto the food. Ok fine. But when someone touches their face and hair and then goes back in the kitchen without washing her hands? I kind of shutter. I've worked in restaurants for so long, that it's just hard for me to NOT notice bad hygienic practices even if to the average person, seems pretty picky. Hey, at least i know the Maricopa County Food Code!

She always takes my order like, \"Ugh, I can't text and I have to take your order????\" 

I once ordered tacos and it was filled with guacamole. Don't get me wrong I love guacamole, but when I order carne asada tacos, I want to taste the meat, too! So I told the girl, excuse me but...these are waaay overpowered by guacamole. She says \"sorry, I cant make you new ones.\" WHAT? Seriously? You served me bad food, and I came here for a decent meal. She said, \"do you want me to pick off the avocado? Well, actually, you can do it yourself?\"  Well.Okaaaaay? Thanks....I'll eat disappointed. I don't know why I deal with terrible places that don't care about the customer. I think it's just become it's the norm with fast food. Anyway, it's not really worth coming here."}
