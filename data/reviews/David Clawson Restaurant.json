{"text":"Our dinner was fantastic. Small plates allowed us to share and enjoy a variety of dishes that were savory and absolutely delicious  We will definitely return 
Service was spot on and wine selection was ample. We did not do the wine pairing. Overall pricing was expensive so will return on special occasion"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner.  Among four of us, we shared no less than fifteen plates. Seriously, each plate we would order again.  My personal favorites: pork belly, rice, sea bass, duck.  Also, don't skip dessert.  Service was friendly yet professional, and consistently attentive. Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"A dream come true!  5 minutes away from home, and OMG!!  What a treat!  We were extremely impressed!  Great, small-scale place with very pleasant interior design; the booths are comfy and private, with a view of the \"bar\" (where we could watch the pastry chef, Meg, at work building deserts! - more on that later!).   Our waiter was Sean, who has an encyclopedic knowledge of the menu, preparation and wines.  He's also a very personable and fun guy... he did a great job, paced everything very well and couldn't have done anything better!  We decided, even  tho the wine list is very decent, to go with \"tasters\" and \"by the glass\" for multiple pairings; the menu suggestions for pairings are well designed, but you're free to stray off the path if you want to.  The idea is \"small plates\" here, but the portions aren't \"tiny\", so no worries about going home hungry!  Between the 3 of us, we sampled about a dozen dishes...  ALL of which were outstanding!   Starting with a couple of blackboard specials... Hamachi \"shooters\" and Boudin Blanc (which is the French style, very soft and delicate)... we knew that we were going to love this place!   The Crab cake is awesome.  The Duck leg confit is To Die For.  Pork belly served with achara and poached pear is like being in bacon heaven.  The Scallop ceviche with mango, lime and avocado is sublime!  And the Beef tenderloin dish is some of the best of anything you'll eat, ever!  Finally, Meg brought us the Sticky Apricot Pudding with rum toffee and vanilla cream, which I paired with a glass of \"J\" champagne to end a Tremendously Wonderful, long drawn-out relaxing meal!  Julia Child would have adored this place!   Bon Appetit!
(Wish I could give it 6 stars!)"}
{"text":"Wow! Food was phenomenal!! Hubby and I came here for date night. We sat at the bar. Friendly staff and even we had the pleasure of meeting David Clawson himself.  Restaurant is modern and clean. We ordered the hamachi shot (x3), bread, shrimp, duck, lamb, veal cheek and the apricot sticky pudding. And I can't forget the caramel me coconut treat served with the bill. Sorry no pictures because we were busy devouring it all! Beer selection was very minimal, but good wine choices. I had the Andrew Will Cabernet, jammy/berry and OMG delish! It's a bit pricey for tapas portions, but the delectable flavors are worth the experience. Overall, amazing hidden gem! Will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Had some new dishes tonight.  As good as the scallop ceviche was, the mussels were even better. I have eaten at this restaurant at least a half a dozen times and it never disappoints. I truly fine gourmet restaurant. Now all I need to figure out is how to upload the photos I took. You will truly drool."}
{"text":"The food and service is exceptional.  Will repeat every time I'm in Vegas.    
The Beef was cooked to perfection and had an amazing chili rub.  The Garlic Noodles live up to their name and aren't for the faint of heart.  The Apricot dessert was delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal! Bison meatballs were delicious as was the lamb flatbread.  Henderson- why go to the strip when you can eat food this fantastic close to home?"}
{"text":"Very very impressed. Small plate menu, but they offer coursed out meals, that the chef will create for you. We had an amazing experience. make sure you save room for the bread pudding. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, fresh and the flavor combinations are perfect! The drink pairing are spot on too! This is definitely a hidden gem and so glad it's close to the house. We've been here twice and plan on going back again for sure!! The chef is there nightly, servers are friendly and the pastry chef makes amazing desserts."}
{"text":"This is going to be a very short review:
*this restaurant is up there with any of the best on the strip.
*if you can, do the wine/drink pairings. They are spot on.
*just close your eyes and point to anything on the menu.  You won't be disappointed. 
*figure on 5 small plates per couple.
*all of the reviews of the dishes are true."}
{"text":"This restaurant is insanely good. The menu spans from Japanese to French, without sacrificing execution through the varied dishes. Everything we had--including the wine--blew us away. Special highlights: truffled gouda, hamachi salad, Yukon potatoes, asparagus, and the chicken. Also have to give a shoutout to Sean, who was an awesome server. This is by far the best restaurant after exiting eastern/215."}
{"text":"We made reservations over 2 1/2 weeks in advance to celebrate a special occasion.  We had been wanting to try the restaurant for quite some time and were excited about it being so close to our house. 

The reservation asked for special requests, so I requested a booth.  Most of the space is booth or counter seating with the exception of a few two tops.  Since we were celebrating a special occasion, we wanted a more relaxing and private table rather than to just sit at a counter.  Also, the 2 tops are very small and we had intended on order several small plates and wine pairings, which a small two top table could not accommodate space for.


On the day of my reservation, I received an email stating that we could not have a booth.  I quickly called the restaurant and David was actually the one that picked up the phone.  I explained my situation and was still told that I could not have a booth.  I explained that I had made my reservations so far in advance, and that we were celebrating a special occasion.  David informed me that he keeps his booths for larger parties on the weekends and couldn't have one tied down just for two people!  He also informed me that he does not reserve tables on a first come first serve basis, which leads the question, what is the point of a reservation?  He offered me either a very small 2 top or counter seating.  I was extremely disappointed with how rude Mr. Clawson spoke to me, and treated me as if he could care less that we dined at his restaurant  that evening.  

Part of providing good customer service is to manage customer expectations.  If you can't accommodate a booth with almost 3 weeks advance notice, then someone should have contacted me prior to that evening.  We reserved a babysitter and were literally given hours notice that our reservation could not be honored.  We ended up canceling our reservation and dining at one of our favorite spots in Las Vegas.  Thankfully we live in the land of thousands of restaurants.

Trying to sustain a 5 star restaurant in a local neighborhood is challenging.  If neighbors and local customers continue to be treated poorly, I have serious questions at the sustainability of this restaurant, regardless of how good the food is.  Unfortunately, this is not the first reservation issue that I have read about.  I hope they fix the problem before they eliminate their clientele."}
{"text":"Took my kids there for Sunday brunch. The staff was amazing and the food was great!!  Wish they would be open for brunch everyday! Love love love!! We needed this is Anthem!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here as soon as you can!! We did a five course tasting menu. Everything was superb. The sea bass was incredible. My favorite dish was the yellowtail salad and my husband loved the tenderloin. I dove into the pork belly so fast it was tender and delicate. Incredible all around!

I don't think you can go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"Amazing meal at David Clawson this week. After reviewing the menu I knew I wanted to try this new restaurant. 

We were seated promptly. I had read on their website they offered a tasting menu. We let our server, Shawn, know we wanted the tasting with pairings. We also wanted the tasting course selections to be chefs choice. We were not disappointed! My teenage children were also at the dinner and they tend to be more vocal about their choices so we pre-selected their 5 courses some what. From the duck confit, sea bass, uni, tenderloin, yellow tail, salmon, sticky date pudding...Every bite was delicious. The pairings were a great compliment to the food. We will be back and often. I just hope I don't have to fight you for a table !"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten here and the food is amazing! This time I fell in love with the crab cake and the veal cheek. The crab cake was just how a crab cake should be made- lots of chunky crab, light breading and no filler- so delicious! The veal cheek was so tender and the sauce was perfect. The beet and papaya salad with chèvre was a perfect starter. The garlic noodles and sticky apricot pudding were just as amazing since the last time I was here. I look forward to the next time I eat here!"}
{"text":"Four of us had a wonderful dinner last night with great food and service.  We are food and wine nuts and found this out the way place perfect as we were able to share and craft our own tasting menu.  The corkage fee of $25 per bottle was very fair.  We tasted just about everything on the menu and all was perfect, amazing for four very picky eaters.  The pastry chef was also great.  Worth the drive, and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"We had eight course menu and wine paring.
Amazing food perfectly balanced with wine for each course. 
You can pic your courses or let Chef David and his team to do the magic and you just enjoy every bite  you have. 
The Veal cheek with gremolata and polenta was my super favorite, but I enjoyed every single dish."}
{"text":"Finally made my way to this restaurant and the food was incredible! Plating was beautiful, staff was friendly (and knowledgeable). We had a party of 7 and basically ordered one of everything on the menu... and of course 2 or more of some of our favorites. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys good food."}
{"text":"Run, don't walk to this amazing restaurant. 

Recently opened in a former neighborhood sushi bar location, this unpretentious restaurant is all about the food.  Serving a wide selection of well constructed inventive small plates, at modest prices, (with suggested paired wines for each plate, - 2 oz. pour available), the chef demonstrates  his skills learned over a long career of cooking in many fine restaurants, Daniel and La Caravelle in NYC among them. His large pleasant staff offers exceptional service."}
{"text":"This place absolutely knows what the hell is up with flavor profiles.   We had 10 dishes and all were amazing.  Can't wait to go back for omakase."}
{"text":"I've heard some praises about the newly opened David Clawson Restaurant in Sun City Anthem. So, when the husband and I were debating where to eat dinner I suggested we check it out. Thankfully, seating was available without a reservation on a Saturday night. We were led to a table right away. There is a certain elegance found in the warmth and simplicity of the space, I felt it immediately. The theme continues throughout the entire meal. The menu is straightforward, and the wine/beer pairings are clearly shown. All without the fuss. It was rather refreshing. 

I've always believed that the best formula is to do a few things, and do them well. DCR really excels at this task. Sure, we had our favorites, but every plate we ordered was tasty and well executed. 

Everything sounded fantastic so we let our friendly server steer us in selecting our choices. The menu is built on small plates meant to be shared so we chose five items to start; The soup ($8), crab ($14), whitefish ($15), duck ($11), and veal ($9). The perfect end was the cheese ($8) and chocolate ($8). The backside of the menu shows the perfect pairing for each dish which may be wine, beer or cider. As much as we would've enjoyed a full pairing it wasn't in the cards for us, since the husband had to return to work. So, we settled on a Squatters Craft Beer \"off duty\" IPA and Tieton Wild Washington Apple Cider. Both were thoroughly enjoyed. 

An amuse bouche of salmon belly whet our appetite. Then, our meal began with the soup. It was too hot to handle, but once it cooled, we were able to enjoy the leak and potato broth seasoned with saffron and dotted with mussels. It was velvety and comforting. 

The whitefish was a lovely cut of seabass and tender bok choy swimming in a delicious bath of miso & kobayaki broth. Outstanding. Truly. The veal cheek was nicely done. I enjoyed it more than the one I recently had at Bazaar Meat. It was beautifully braised; and paired with the merlot? Stellar. The bits of mushrooms, bacon and kaboucha were not to be missed. 

The crab cake was very yummy and it would typically be a favorite, but we had already enjoyed the cheeks and the seabass. Both are tough acts to follow. The duck leg confit had great flavor with hints of citrus and the sweetness of honey. I really enjoyed the tart blueberries. The meat alone was tad dry. 

Our love affair with gouda began long ago, when we see it, we must have it so the cheese plate was a done deal. How does gouda get even better? Add truffles. Oh my goodness, we were in heaven. The housemade crackers and fig jam were great too, and I've had a long time weakness when it comes to marcona almonds, but that cheese? Yum. 

Lastly, I was unable to resist ending on a sweet note. I had to try the chocolate dessert. It too was wonderful. Rich, creamy, crunchy, sweet, but not too sweet. It was just right. As if that wasn't enough, with our check we were given the most delicious white chocolate and basil truffles. They really know how to leave a lasting impression. Bravo. 

When I suggested dinner at DCR, I had no idea we where in for such a treat. It was such a pleasant surprise. I'm ridiculously happy that it is in my neck of the woods. But let it be known, it is well worth traveling to the edge of the valley for this gem."}
{"text":"We live in Anthem and have been anxiously awaiting the restaurant to open after reading Next Door postings from David Clawson keeping all informed of the style and mission of his restaurant.  We finally had a chance to go last night and it lived up to all he promised it to be...great quality food, great service and a comfortable atmosphere. 

We all enjoyed each dish we shared.  Yellowtail salad was out of this world (I'm getting a whole order just for myself next time!). Even the non dessert person at our table loved the apricot sticky love. 

I look forward to trying more menu items as we savored each item we tried.  

I love the personal touch of the chef coming to our table throughout the night.  He has created a vibe with the staff that shows great care and pride.  What a great gem in our backyard!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've ever had. The bison meatball is to die for! Amazing staff, especially the pastry chef Meg. Decor and ambiance is wonderful.  This restaurant could be on the Strip."}
{"text":"After eating here last night, I am reducing every other place I've ever ate down to one star! This will be the only place I am going to eat while in Vegas, I am not even going to try anywhere else. 

Service: Super quick, very attentive, very knowledgeable about the food and wine. 

Food: It's no secret I eat, and I ate a lot. I had six courses, I picked a couple and also let my waitress pick a couple. I can't even tell you what was my favorite, each course was equally the best but if you are looking for recommendations the crab cakes and chocolate were spot on. The attention to detail was absolutely amazing.

Wine: Perfect! I let the chef pick the parings and they were spot on!

I made reservations again for tonight, to bad we're leaving out tomorrow otherwise it would be ever night this year."}
{"text":"Wow, don't waste a minute! GET HERE.....
Everything was amazing! 
What a great place*****"}
{"text":"Great experience of food and wine pairings. It's not a place for casual diners but more of a refined pallet. Whatever they do to the scallops and yellowtail is a mystery it is so good. It is a little hidden in location however worth the drive. The prices are extremely high you have been warned. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Finally a high quality restaurant off the strip! Chef David Clawson brings to Henderson fine ingredients and put together an amazing menu. I dined there last Saturday and I absolutely loved it! My favorite (so far, because I want to go back and try the rest of the menu!) are the foie gras, the quail (which was perfectly cooked) and the sea bass in miso. I'm not a dessert person but since I was seating at the counter and had the lovely pastry chef chatting with me I had to tried one of her creations. I had the \"dessertini\" and it was simply delicious! The plates are small but big enough to share, with an Asian flare the presentation is delicate and well balanced. I would definitely recommend to do the 2 oz wine pairing, it enhanced the flavors to the max. Friendly staff, beautiful clean modern unpretentious restaurant. A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"While David Clawson's is a bit out of the way, it is well worth the drive! Everything we ate was wonderful, we will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Good for what it is. Elegant & sophisticated atmosphere with upscale food & prices but don't come here if you are very hungry.  We have done similar tapas type cuisines before but the portions  here are unreasonably small in my opinion. In terms of service forget it unless they know you or you fit the mold of what they feel their customers should be. Server had a very condescending tone & made us feel uncomfortable. Oh sure, he said the right things but it was obvious that he was just going through the motions & wasn't really sincere.  Pretty much the same with the rest of the staff. Had to remind him twice to refill our water & a requested sharper knife to split the tiny portions never came. So they loose one star for portion size & one for service. We live in the neighborhood so we may give it one more try but first impression was that the creativeness of their dishes did not outweigh their slow & somewhat impersonal service."}
{"text":"FINALLY a restaurant in Anthem with delicious food, good wine and friendly staff! When salmon sashimi was brought out on the house, compliments of the chef, we knew we were in for a treat. We started with the bread (soft, buttery, challah like, too good not to pass up) and yellowtail salad (light, flavorful, I'll take 17 more please...) For our entrees, the noodles (for garlic lovers only), duck, sea bass (cooked perfectly, seasoned to perfection in a bowl of broth, bok choy and mushrooms) and potatoes. Make sure to save room because the toffee is OUT OF THIS WORLD. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Birthday Celebration and DCR did not disappoint!
   The mussel soup tasty, although could have used a pinch of salt, very rich & creamy~ the mushroom bruschetta with some garlic, a crab cake with more crab than bread! fried to serving perfection on all sides,chopped tomato and delicate greens, quite tasty, scallops with tapico bursts, such incrediable, distinctive flavors, the shrimp  & chorizo perched on corn polenta, veal cheek, smooth, cooked superbly, beef tenderloin you could cut with a fork, and some of the most delicious Au Gratin potatos you've EVER had~
   We finished up with the Bailey's Brûlée AND the Sticky Apricot Love, cuz a trip the David Clawson Restaurant is not complete without this most FAB dessert ~ 
   Come to DCR for a most enchanting dinner assortment of small plate options of deliciousness~ you won't leave needing to stop @ the neighborhood drive thur."}
{"text":"Total package: top notch food and service. Really like the layout (can watch chefs being meticulous) and the format (small plates, don't have to commit for one huge entree). And the location is great- so nice to have this quality of a restaurant in the Anthem area."}
{"text":"Great food.  This is the perfect date night or going out to dinner with friends.  Everything is amazing.  I have never said this before because it sounds like I am on the payroll.  The style of dining allows for many flavored to be sampled and leave room for the apricot pudding desert.  Wow!!"}
{"text":"I am heartbroken to hear this spot has closed! Located way on the edge of Henderson, surrounded by suburbia, David Clawson Restaurant is a gem in an unlikely place. The understated décor and sushi-bar-turned-chefs-table keep the focus right where it should be: on the food. Took a group of visiting friends here for an adventurous evening of small plates and wine.

PARKER HOUSE ROLLS: Served alongside  a salted butter, this bread was anything but basic. Crunchy outside cooked in a cast-iron skillet, soft and fluffy inside, this disappeared fast.
BRUSSELS SPROUTS: A roasted version with manchego, mustard, and bacon. Addictive for their crunch, enjoyed around the table.
TIGER SHRIMP: Beautiful, fun presentation of large, fresh shrimp with jicama, chipotle, and cilantro. This ranked lower than other seafood dishes of the night.
BEET SALAD: This is the only dish we had that I can say was pretty average, nothing to set it apart from other versions in other restaurants around town. 
HOKKAIDO SCALLOP CEVICHE: Beautiful presentation with mango, lime, and onion, this was a major hit among our group, hitting all the right notes with the fresh fish and balanced flavors.
TUNA: Served sashimi-style on a brick of pink Himalayan sea salt, this was a bright, fresh dish that all enjoyed. 
GARLIC NOODLES: So fragrant, a mere whiff might off a vampire. Chewy noodles, savory sauce, a dish we nearly skipped but were glad we added at the last minute.
SALMON WITH RICE?: A certain member of our group wanted to petition the staff to rename this dish \"orgasm salmon\", it resonated with her so much. The rice was described by our server as being \"like a risotto\" but clearly was inspired by Asian congee dishes. Simple and savory.
LAMB: Star of the night. This was one of the best versions of lamb I have ever had. It was painful to have to share it with the other diners. Tender, succulent meat with crisp vegetables and a robust sauce, this is something I would cross town for again, easily. 
STICKY APRICOT PUDDING: Warm cake in a sea of hot toffee sauce reminiscent of maple syrup, topped with a mini cannoli. The dessert lovers at our table swooned over this version. 
SALTED CARAMELS WITH COCONUT FLAKES: The bill was accompanied by these tiny sweet treats that were a final delight to our meal. I enjoyed the texture and subtle nutty sweetness of the flakes, and the caramel itself was on point.

Service was warm and made helpful suggestions. One of our party had to leave early, and our server ensured that the dishes he wanted to try came out in time for him to enjoy them. I'm not a fan of the location, which was difficult to find, but can find nary a fault with the restaurant itself. Hoping to hear of this spot reopening in a better location, it  was going to be a staple spot for us to bring visiting friends and family!"}
{"text":"Had the most superb dinner.  Highly recommend this restaurant.  Service was top notch, thank you Beth!  Loved the beef medallion and the lamb!  The wine pairings were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Another incredible meal at David Clawson!  It was the perfect way to end a very stressful week & kickoff a relaxing weekend.  To the hardworking Anthem community - if you haven't yet discovered the wonderful cuisine offered here I strongly encourage you to do so.  We are very lucky to have a restaurant of this quality in our neighborhood, and I love the flexibility to have a light meal of one small plate or indulge in several tastings and wine pairings.

We were both in the mood for seafood/fish, and David Clawson has such a nice variety of European-size plates from shellfish to fish to fowl to red meat to vegetable to dessert that there's something for everyone.  Even nicer is that the menu introduces new dishes, keeping the experience fresh & interesting.  And the wine & sake!  You don't have to commit to a full glass, because a generous selection is available for 2 oz tastings (although beer is full bottle) as well as 5 oz pours.

We started with the yellowtail salad with avocado & sprouts; it's such a lovely, refreshing way to start our meal.  I started with a Moscato as my \"aperitif\".  We decided to try the asparagus with romain lettuce, Parmesan, and white anchovies with a gorgeous Meyer lemon sauce.  I don't like anchovies.  I don't eat anchovies.  Until now.  So well done!

The duck was highly recommended, and I can see why.  Perfectly prepared \"duck confit with honey, lemon, and luscious blueberries\" (David-Clawson.com).  By this time I had finished a refreshing glass of \"J\" vineyards cuvée, a sparkling white from Sonoma.

We were looking forward to the sea bass, and it comes recommended with the Shimizu No Mai \"Pure Dawn\" Junmai Ginjo.  Holy cow, what a pretty, pretty miso broth and sake pairing.  The sea bass is, again, perfectly prepared and sits atop a delicate, flavorful miso broth with tiny mushrooms and bok choy.  I was sipping on a glass of Pinot Gris from Willamette Valley - this may be one of \"go to\" whites.  It's so nice to sip and relax while  nibbling.

I had to try the crab cakes again even though we were full by then - so good!  Thank you David Clawson for another lovely meal!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem.  Every bite is very tasty. It's too bad it's closed in Sunday and Monday. 
I am looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"We wanted to try David Clawson for some time now - in part because of the great Yelp reviews and in part because it is so close to my home. The restaurant itself is in a nondescript small Albertsons shopping center with a Pizza Hut and a Tropical Smoothie right next door. Regarding the interior ambiance, it's also pretty nondescript. In its prior life it was a Japanese restaurant, so the sushi bar is still intact. Except now you can sit there and order off the menu, no sushi chefs in sight. There are several booths along the wall which is where we chose to be seated. I felt it was a little too dark and dreary for a high end restaurant (with its prices, it earns its $$$ rating). They certainly didn't spend a lot on interior decorating. Overall, calling it unexciting ambiance is being generous. Regarding the service, our server came over right away and explained the small plates concept and went over the specials. she was warm and welcoming.  In general, the service was good but not great. In a good restaurant, your water glass should never be allowed to get below half empty. My wife's glass was completely empty for so long she ended up drinking most of mine before anyone came by to refill it. The dishes were served in a fairly nicely spaced out fashion so we were never rushing to finish one before the next one arrived. In most $$$ restaurants that I have eaten in, the manager or the maitre d' will come by to ask how things are going. Not so at David Clawson. Our server, at one point well into the meal while she was clearing dishes, asked how we enjoyed the prior dish. David Clawson himself did bring one dish to the table. But he didn't even bother making token conversation. He just dropped the dish and walked off (not Mr. Personality I guess). Regarding the food - now here is where this place is supposed to shine. Not so much. I started with the Hamachi Shot. This was a shot glass with some raw tuna in a vinegary sauce and a green garnish. This was absolutely delish. Next came the crab cake. My wife thought it was good. I gave it an \"OK.\" Many of the other reviewers raved about the seabass. Not me. Yes, it was moist and had an interesting crust, but the fish itself was bleh. Next came the beef. The cooked it exactly as I requested. The quality of the meat was actually very good. But the dish was really nothing special. We also got the noodle dish. It was described on the menu as noodles, garlic, and more garlic. They didn't lie. This dish was absolutely delicious. In fact, it was the highlight of the meal. Our final dish was the portabello mushroom. I would describe it as extremely unexciting. In summary, the ambiance was well below expectations for a high end restaurant, service was very pleasant but not great, and food was good in two out of six dishes but meh in 4 out of 6. Hence the 3 star rating."}
{"text":"We finally tried this restaurant last night and we're so glad we did. It's so nice to have a restaurant of this caliber off the strip. We tried a number of the small plate choices and each one was just plain awesome. The pork belly is to die for, and the duck confit is out of this world. I can't wait for go back and try some of the other things I didn't order. I think we found our new favorite restaurant.  I highly recommend this place, you won't be disappointed.

Edited 3/13/15:

Since my first review of David Clawson we have been eating there quite often and slowly working our way thru the menu. Everything we have tried so far is 5 star.  It's hard to get past our favorites like the duck confit, heluka pork, and jumbo lump crab cake, but last night I finally tried the Quail.  I can't tell you how awesome this quail is, words can't explain. This is right up there with one of  the best things I've ever eaten.  This restaurant keeps getting better every time we go. Along with David's awesome menu comes the awesome front of house...great food, great staff, great dining experience."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to since I moved to Las Vegas.  I'm devastated to hear that they've closed."}
{"text":"Best food I've ever had - and they are right here in Anthem!! The portions won't stuff you, and this is a refreshing change from most restaurants.  I would recommend getting several dishes to share with the table. Yes it is a bit pricey, but everything is well prepared and very high quality so the price reflects that. There is not a bad choice on the menu.  Check the board for specials before you order. I only wish they would have wine tasting nights - and I hope they bring brunch back! Just be sure to make a reservation, this place is small, getting to be very popular, and most of the time you can't just walk in anymore!"}
{"text":"WOW...amazing....and mouth orgasmic!! David is the most amazing chef and this Resturant and his staff is a must!! Don't bother ordering off the menu just have the chef David create his craft and enjoy his passion as it comes through clearly in his food. So decadent and delicious! He created magic as we were served his 5 courses with foie gras, scallops, oysters, lamb, filet mignon and the most amazing butter toffee cake....who does this?? Well Chef David does. This place is a definite find and a MUST GO to place!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry Yelp, no more pictures because the second the food came, it was devoured...every little morsel of the Bison Meatball, Duck Leg Confit and the sea bass. Please, please save room for dessert! The Sticky Apricot Pudding sends you to heaven...I'm still there!"}
{"text":"Beyond amazing food, wine and service!  Sean is beyond awesome server!  Asparagus/shiitake, smoked salmon, lamb tbone, potato and chocolate tart were all truly exceptional!  Spanish red wine for 27 a bottle is unbelievable great value!"}
{"text":"Delectably delicious David! All I can think about is returning to experience it all over again (preferably with ALL of the wine tastings). I was nervous when we sat down and learned that it was small plates because my other half is the kind of man who likes big juicy meals. To my happy surprise the flavor of every dish was so big and juicy that he can't wait to go back! And that's saying something.

We started with the bread, which was warm allowing the well-balanced red salt butter to melt oh so sweetly. Next, the scallops. It caught me off guard that they were raw, but I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed them; but they definitely aren't filling. I absolutely loved the next three dishes: beef, shrimp, and potatoes! Must eat these!!! While eating the beef tenderloin I took a sip of my Cabernet and couldn't believe how perfectly they tasted together! This is coming from lady who has had many glasses of wine with steak. After realizing that the pairings actually took my food to a heavenly level and weren't just about up selling I had to try more! So when we the pork belly (never had before) came out our sweet waitress brought along the wine pairing...one of the best combinations I've ever tasted! I was addicted by this point! Wine pairing with my sticky apricot love dessert? Yes please!!! 

The staff are very friendly, the decor is nice, and the atmosphere is relaxing. 

Bottom line: I love this place and I would gladly run 6 miles a day to eat here! Worth every calorie I ate and drank...and more!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed with our dining experience here. The idea is upscale small plates meant to share, recommended to have 3-4 plates a person. The menu has only one dish per category, and we got the soup, noodle, veal, liver, and steak special. Next to each category, there's a full description of the dish, as well as a wine pairing suggested to each dish on the back. My favorite was the veal cheek with butternut squash, paired with a Merlot. Absolutely fork tender and melt in your mouth. His favorite was the fois gras, which was perfectly seared. Everything was delicious though, and service was fantastic. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had dinner with friends last night at D Clawsons.  What an adventure with food. The presentations, the quality of food and preparation was top notch!  We tried 10 items and each was perfection! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Highly, highly recommend.  We tried about 75% of the menu and everything we tried was phenomenal.  I consider myself a foodie, I like to treat myself to the best when it comes to dining.  This was one of the best restaurants I've been to in years.  It's a drive, but it's worth it.  Some dishes that stood out:  pork belly, shrimp, and lamb.  Even the wine was reasonably priced and fantastic.  Next time we'll do the wine pairings--a .02 or .05 oz pour paired with each course you ordered."}
{"text":"Our dinner and service was amazing. Our server, Mark, was fantastic. The menu has something for everyone. 
Don't skip dessert, all of them are fantastic."}
{"text":"Delicious gazpacho.  Portobello mushrooms.  Lush oysters.  Salmon baked with onions. Sea bass served in the most sumptuous broth with Bob chop. Chow me in noodles with garlic. Chocolate Lava cake.  Splendiferous"}
{"text":"Excellent off strip restaurant.  All small plates, so great date night place.  Brussel sprouts were excellent, as was the pork belly.   Wine could improve with a few more specially selected wines to go with the various plates.  Had the  kushi oysters...while good, not as good as l'atelier.  Quail was good, but not great.  My wife had the pea soup, which was excellent.  Service was good.  While we didn't have desert, the deserts looked awesome and the pastry chef personally delivered them to our surrounding tables.   Definitely a go to place off strip."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! I am from Napa originally, so appreciate a restaurant that has good food and good wine. Would go back and recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Had a lot of trouble finally getting to try DCR because it's always closed so early! I'm a late diner for Anthem I suppose. Call, make sure the kitchen is open if you're going to try and eat here after 8 pm, this is not a joke..

But I'm glad I was persistent. Every plate was fantastic - without exception. This is a great local restaurant with a passionate staff. Loved and sat at the open prep area in the middle of the room, chatting up the pastry chef and meeting David himself who was fun and a little snarky like all confident chefs should be. The waitress kept assumptively asking us 'great huh?' 'isn't that great'? every time we took a first bite of something we were served but it was cute, at least she was absolutely correct :)"}
{"text":"With a menu is guided by the principles of sustainability, a wine/beer/or sake pairing for every item on the menu, and several well composed dishes, David Clawson Restaurant is certainly worth checking out!

DCR is definitely the best food in the Anthem Hills area...though that's not saying much...but still it is a welcome addition.  The drink pairing were very well thought out!  We took part in multiple pairings and this was one of my favorite aspects.  DCR did their homework with the pairings and it paid off!  I was impressed with how many items were offered by the glass for a restaurant this size, and hope they can sustain this approach!

We enjoyed the following items:
pork- Certainly liked the achara & pear with this pork belly
oyster- Delightfully fresh and bright...I'm a sucker for ponzu w/ oysters 
salad - Avocado & pomegranate play so nice with salmon
tuna - Like to addition of scallop and yuzu
lamb - Wonderfully cooked and seasoned
fruit - You had me at sticky
rice - This was an excellent idea for a dish...think uni risotto.  We would have like to have had more uni as it was a little thin compared to the portion of rice, but for the price the uni portion made sense.  

Here is a look at the menu when they opened:

DCR is most certainly a 5 Star, \"As Good As It Gets\" option for this area of town, and with a few modifications I'd consider garnishing them with 5.  I'm sure we'll go out of our way to make it back at some point.

David was in the kitchen the night we came in.  He made point to come by and was very genuine and down to earth.  I like his approach to food and service."}
{"text":"Holy yum!! Everything was freshly prepared with quality ingredients. Nice atmosphere and great service.  Big shout out to Meg the pastry chef, the tiramasu was marvelous! Try the duck and the tiger shrimp, there surely will be taste buds tingling!  Thanks again to the chef and staff! See you next week!"}
{"text":"After visiting on opening night I wasn't sure if I would be back. I'm glad I did. The portions are a little small for the price, but everything tasted pretty great and our waiter Sean was super bomb. He definitely made the overall experience better. We'll be sure to go back at some point in the future. Thanks so much for changing my mind!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out as is been here for about 6 months. Great food service and best of all its close to the house lol. The shrimp dish is amazing and everything has a wine pairing. Great chocolate lava cake with prickly pear puree. Check it out again. Great great food John"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant previously but only had a glass of wine - which was very good and the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1. Unfortunately tonight we went to grab a glass of wine and an appetizer and not only was the hostess very rude, and made us wait for a prolonged period before greeting us, but there were at least 6 open tables and she told us and the family behind us they were 'all booked up'. There were two seats at the bar and we explained we just wanted a quick drink and appetizer but she said no. Not great business practice for a 'local' restaurant. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Clean tasting food done right. Prices very palatable for the quality.  The glass of rose was also very nice. The only other restaurant that tastes this clean in vegas may be charlie palmers at four seasons and Omae."}
{"text":"Luved it!  Everything we ordered was unique, bite size and tasty!"}
{"text":"One thing this side of town has a serious lack of is locally owned, chef driven restaurants. Everywhere you look, it's Claim Jumper, P.F Changs, California Pizza Kitchen...well, for only being open a few weeks, David Clawson breathes new life into the southeast Las Vegas/Henderson area.

The atmosphere is simple: dimly lit, booths and tables around the walls and a large bar area in the middle...nothing fancy nor overdone, just perfectly balanced.

They don't quite have their liquor license yet, so for those who partake in the sauce, you will have to make do with wine and beer for now.

But on to the food. I love the minimalist style of the menu. It makes it easy to order (\"I'll have the bread, salad and pork\"). So simple, yet elegant. Everything is meant to be shared, and everything is served in small portions or \"tapas\" style.

That being said, we ordered quite a bit. I won't go over everything, but I'll talk about some of the hits and misses. The best part of the meal were the cold dishes: tuna, scallop, cheese plate, yellowtail salad. Well balanced, fresh and expertly prepared. These, alone, were enough to make me want to come back. Also, the pork belly was perfect: rich and fatty, accented with brightly seasoned veg and sweet applesauce. 

Some of the hot dishes, however, missed the mark slightly. This was mostly due to a severe lack of seasoning. The filet itself could've used a bit more salt, but the veg that came with it literally had zero salt. The salmon, while very fresh and full of flavor was overcooked. On the other end of the spectrum, the mushrooms with balsamic and olives were overpowered with a tart vinegar taste and the salinity of the olives just enhanced that. I loved the Shanghai garlic noodles, but it would've been nice to have some kind of vegetable tossed in there.


At the end of our meal, we shared the \"sticky apricot love\" and the epoisses cheese plate. The former: one of the best desserts I've ever had. The latter: beautifully rich and pungent (stinky) French cheese accented with earthy fresh figs and luxurious truffled honey. Sublime.

All in all, I think this restaurant has amazing potential to be something great....there were many hits and a few misses, but I have no doubt that they'll be corrected soon. Bravo, chef!

Oh! I forgot to mention that they've only been open a few weeks and the food came out unbelievably quick! That's unheard of!"}
{"text":"Not sure why we waited so long to try this place. Let me tell you, AMAZING!!!! They do serve small portions here, but it lends you to try many plates. All served with the freshest and the highest quality ingredients. Each dish we tried was delicious and perfectly paired with amazing flavors. Please come and support the Anthem Highlands best dining establishment!!!! I guarantee you will not be disappointed to make the trip up here to try this fabulous restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Love the menu the  food and the presentation.....but the two times we have gone their they have the most ungracious, awkward hostess who makes you feel like you are intruding and must have her permission to enter....we even volunteered to leave but she ALLOWED us to stay but that our seat AT THE BAR was in demand (5 pm and lots of tables and no one at the bar) We assured her we had theater tickets and would be quick."}
{"text":"Kind of hate the secret getting out on this restaurant.  A truly high quality modern dining experience just outside of Del Webb Anthem. Not a location where you would expect to find high quality modern American tapas dining. Food and service were superb.  Definitely not the same place same thing. I just hope he doesn't make a move to the strip. This restaurant (while decor is very good, not high end strip level) compares with the best strip famous name chef restaurants. Complete with an inventive pastry chef.  Definitely the best off strip restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"CLOSED?????? Went there for dinner Friday night and the place was locked up shut. Called the phone number and got the usual message. Anyone know what happened?"}
{"text":"Facts first:
The menu is a dream for someone who loves to eat without filling up on staples like rice, mashed potatoes or other fillers.  
It goes down a list of items with very simple descriptions but the tastes are burst in your mouth/soul wonderful!
Happily hubby and I searched around a bit for something that would speak to us.  We weren't excited about most of what we'd seen in the big hotels or even off the path a little bit.  Then saw the menu and information about David out in Henderson.  We love food and a 25 min drive is nada when you come from Southern California.
We enjoyed the \"whitefish\" sea bass with an great balanced broth, mushrooms and bokchoy; \"shrimp\" black tiger shrimp with fresh corn, chorizo, chipotle and jicama.  (This reminded me a lot of the flavors in the Jicama Shrimp taco at The Blind Burro in San Diego designed by Sara Polczynski (student of Rick Bayless).)  I love the flavors and the freshness.  \"Pork\" pork belly with pear tender and meaty goodness.  Scallop Ceviche - sweet and to the point with the right amount of acid balance.  Crab cake is mainly crab and very little cake - you won't be disappointed, one order is one crab cake of bursting flavor.  The mushroom but wish I had started with it instead of ending with it to warm up to the delicious dishes.  The most surprising dish - the Artichoke!  The taragon-key lime sauce was a dream come true.  I didn't let the dish disappear I finished that sauce for dessert and had visions of Taragon-key lime cake or cheese cake - perhaps with manchengo or quark?  Just ideas running around my head.  Best of all David joined us at our table, signed a menu and was gracious and grateful for his new found transition from Vail, Co to Henderson, NV.  Henderson, don't let this gem slip through your fork tongs!!  Quality over quantity anytime for us!  Wine, Sake and Beer offered, no bar/liquor.  I cannot think of anyone who would be disappointed.  Unless you're someone who enjoys buffets for the \"value\"."}
{"text":"My New Favorite Local Restaurant

This little gem is tucked away in Anthem, but it is well worth the drive.  The staff is friendly and the restaurant is very simple, but elegant.  I like that the chef delivers some of the dishes to the table, which is a nice personal touch.  The staff needs some training about wine and how it needs to open, but it was great being able to order 2 oz so we could try different wines during the night.  All in all, go there expecting to order about 7 or 8 plates.  Everything we had was top notch, except the scallops.  The scallops are a complete miss (really, should be taken off the menu completely), but all the other food makes up for that.  I'm looking forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Yup another 5 star review. What can I say that hasn't already been said in the previous 27 five star reviews? 

- \"The food here is amazing\", Duh, the chef is like a 35 year restaurant vet.
- \"Decor is a little on the plain side\", Hmm... when you're face is buried in a plate of food do you really care what's hanging on the wall? 
- \"It's a little pricey\", That's the normal cost of gourmet food. Sorry Vegas not every eatery boast a $7 lobster tail and steak special. 
- \"The portions are small\", this is actually the normal sized portions a person should be consuming. 

This back and forth rant between my dueling foodie personalities could go on forever, and trust me it does, but lets cut to the chase. David Clawson's is a truly special restaurant, where else can you find food of this caliber off the strip? Not just of this caliber, but with the attention to detail and heart. 

You can tell each plate of food that comes out of this kitchen has been painstakingly mulled over, delicately placed, and handbuilt for pure palate pleasing satisfaction. No careless or throwaway dishes in this place. The layers of flavor here are something like that of a foodie geography lesson, with each new found layer of flavor it almost forces you to sit back and mentally dissect what you just ate.  

When I first came here, I sat at the counter or bar area and was immediately greeted by a server and a busser, one to welcome me and one to take my drink order. I got a weird japanese feeling when I walked into David Clawson. The plain walls and minimalist decor is something like a traditional dojo or L.A. hipster's living room. When I asked about the previous owner of the space I was told it used to be a sushi restaurant. Well, now it all makes sense. 

I ordered about 6 plates of food which myself and my foodie partner in crime shared. Like mentioned earlier, everything here is thought inducing and delicious. The menu matches the decor, minimalist and direct, with one word  options like: potato, mushroom, sausage, and cheese. This is a very smart move of David Clawson, he's sort of masquerading the menu as simple and unassuming, with these singular word menu writings. Then when your food arrives, you realize you've gone from a single word snack to a lengthy and descriptive paragraph of foodie delight. 

As I finished eating, I noticed the executive chef himself David Clawson came out and personally greeted each and every customer. Amazing customer service and it adds that human factor to the food. If you noticed I didn't mention what I ate in this review, because it would simply take me forever to describe the experience. Just look at the photos I posted along with review and make the decision for yourself."}
{"text":"Neighborhood Gem!  Special Occasions!  Any night of the Week!

I'd describe this restaurant as Upscale Casual.  Not Fancy-Shmancy nor is it Snooty... but this place has Class while being inviting and friendly.

This restaurant is Fresh and Welcoming!
Love the approach David Clawson has taken with his concept.
Here it's all about the understated elegance, and letting the food speak for itself.
His menu appears (on the surface) to be a bit simplistic... But not to worry, the flavors are complex and bountiful.  Everything we ordered was beautifully presented and tasted fantastic!  

My Key Note is ... Do Not Be Afraid.
(...And you must be a fairly adventurous eater. Picky eaters who only like their food a certain way, stay home.)
The staff is there to guide you, and answer any and all questions.  
So.. definitely ask away.

What we ordered: (gosh almost everything!)

FIRST COURSE - Starters: 
Bread
Asparagus
Shrimp
Jumbo Sea Scallops (special of the day)

SECOND COURSE - Mains:
Quail
Duck
Veal
Potato
Portobello Mushroom

THIRD COURSE - Dessert:
Apricot Sticky Pudding
Chocolate Lava Cake
Coffee
White Chocolate Basil Truffles (presented with bill)

Oh and a bottle of Pinot Noir.

There were 3 of us... total before tax was $196.  For all the different foods we enjoyed, the wine, the quality of everything... this is a deal!  (This meal would have easily run us $350 or more on the strip.) The really GREAT thing is... it's in \"da neighborhood\"... for us it's like a 15 minute drive on side streets."}
{"text":"Stopped by this restaurant in Anthem.
What a surprise.
Had 5 items on the menu. Every item paired with wine or sake.
Wow, what a nice surprise.
Food came out quickly, staff was very nice and the decor was perfect for this type of gourmet restaurant
If you live in the Anthem area, this is definitely a restaurant you need to try.
Nothing like it in the anthem area."}
{"text":"Best food I've ever had!!! The owners are amazing and I can't say enough good things about the service! Seriously everything we ate was absolutely phenomenal!!! We live in anthem and are so glad to finally have a good restaurant in the area. Tapas size portions so great for any size appetite!! Crab cakes, sea bass, and sticky apricot love really were like heaven!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location inside a strip mall fool you, this hidden gem is just that. 
I loved the idea that all the plates were small servings and each paired with a different wine to suit it's best flavor.

We tried the pork belly, beef tenderloin, duck confit, smoked salmon (one of the best I've ever had), the Yukon gold potatoes (also some of the best potatoes I've ever had. The waiter described it as a warm hug). For desert we had the pudding with sticky apricot love  and a cannoli type vanilla cream pastry on top. TO DIE FOR! Everything was amazing, something to write home about. Our waiter was extremely knowledgable and gave us an honest opinion about what was his favorite. We even met the chef. He is top notch! I am going to tell everyone about this place and we let them know they will be seeing us again soon!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me!!!!!  We stumbled upon this restaurant by chance, and now it is our go to place.
Everything we have ordered has been amazing.
I'm originally from Oregon where amazing restaurants are abundant, so after moving to Henderson, I was a bit disappointed.  Not anymore- this is the real deal and I would recommend this restaurant to everyone.
The quail is superb and do not for get The Sticky Apricot dessert- worth every calorie!

{"text":"We basically tried everything on the menu and were NOT disappointed. Duck Confit, Korean beef, and cucumber soup were our top faves! Delicious and wonderful!"}
{"text":"So good.  The quality of the food and service is as good as at top strip restaurants for a much fairer price.  NOT cheap, but not over the top expensive and well worth it.  It's great to have this kind of quality in Anthem."}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG! D E L I C I O U S!

where have you been my whole life in Anthem. This place is what we have been waiting for.  The service is amazing. Meg dished up deserts that you can only dream about and Sean knows more about wine pairing than I have learned with 50 years of wine drinking. Spectabular food and wonderful ambiance.  Mr. Clawson and his team give you the royal treatment.

I wouldn't pass up this place ever again.

My new spot.  

Thank you for bringing in what Anthem deserves and has been waiting for.

Gouremt with a relaxed atmosphere.

Wishing you the best success.

Best Regards,

{"text":"Amazing food! My top pick for best restaurants off the strip. The quality of the seafood is top notch. Dave Clawson can definitely hold his own among the top rated chefs in Las Vegas. I'll be coming here once a week since it's 3 minutes away."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this restaurant one night when we didn't want to travel far from home. We shared a few different entrees, the best of which was the lamb chops. David himself brought out a free appetizer for trying his restaurant as well.

The service was good, although the restaurant wasn't that busy so I'm not sure what it would be like if the place was packed.

Inside of the restaurant, the atmosphere is nice. There is a bar in the center which is a nice place to eat if you're in for a quick bite and the tables are nice, but small - more of a romantic size.

At some point, I'm sure we'll go back, although their menu is specialized, so it's a bit limited and the prices are a little high for what you get. Even so, I'm glad to have a local restaurant close to home that is a nicer place to eat than a fast food joint."}
{"text":"the steak with finger nail of blue cheese, and pork belly were good but of course a little small. My wife loved the shrimp. I liked the crab. artichoke sauce was too strong. the noodles were good. Service was great if a little to much checking...tab was 200 for 2 with bottle of bubbly and 2 glasses of wine. wine aint cheap at all. deserts were fantastic, ordered 2. coconut and sticky pudding. might go back again but not too soon. Chef came out several times to see folks but did not bother to say hello when we were only ones there for a few."}
{"text":"Worst restuarant I have ever been to!!  Poor, slow service, food undercooked, food came out at different times, no organization, yelling done by chef to his co workers, people were late to other places due to slow service, people were told they could not keep their reservation.  Will never go back"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the neighborhood by far and one of the best in the city! Get the crabcake and don't miss dessert!! Great service too."}
{"text":"Michael U and I decided to try this new place.  We made a 6:30 reservation for the Chef's Counter.  On arrival, we were greeted and promptly seated.  The two sided, 20 seat Chef's Counter is the remnants of what was a sushi restaurant at this location.  The other restaurant seating consists of booths one one side along the wall and the side toward the windows consists of tables but not booths.  The Chef's Counter gives you the chance to see some of the work being done by the chefs.

We ordered 22 plates and asked our server, Sean, to arrange them in courses which he did quite well.  The menu lists items as bread, beef, whitefish, etc. and then describes the ingredients.  Over the next two and a half hours, we had:

Salmon belly amuse-bouche
Simulated sea water with uni and seaweed amuse-bouche
Bread
Corn bisque soup
Yellowtail salad
Scallop plate with tamari, finger lime and tobiko
Mushroom bruschetta plate
Foie gras
Jumbo lump crab cake
Rice with uni, salmon, and reggiano cream
Boudin blanc
Berkshire pork belly with pear
Chicken with green chile and macaroni
Black tiger shrimp
Duck leg confit
House made lo mein noodles with garlic, more garlic
Lamb t-bone with shishito peppers
Beef tenderloin
Yukon gold scalloped potatoes
Sticky apricot pudding with vanilla cream and rum toffee
Chocolate feuilletine crunch
Crème brûlée
Eposisses cheese with quince and truffle honey
Truffle gouda with fig and marcona almond
Chocolate truffles with basil with the bill

We shared everything except for getting two orders of bread and soup.

Rather than go over everything, I'll try to mention my favorites although there was nothing that wasn't excellent!  The scallop on rice with lime was stunning in how good it was.  The lime in the rice just made the scallop shine.  The rice with uni was very creamy and tasty.  The noodles with garlic and more garlic was a stand out for sure.  House made lo mein noodles with lots of garlic and some scallions was superb!  The chicken and a nice zing with spices and the black tiger shrimp were equally spicy.  We ended the meal with a trio of desserts--all excellent--and two very good cheese courses.  Finally were were brought two homemade chocolate truffles with basil.  What a great addition for a chocolate truffle.

Sean delivered some of the plates and explained their ingredients.  Sometimes another server would bring the dishes and explain.  Sean tried to get around to do some more in depth explanation.  Service was excellent.  It matched the food.

Chef Clawson's restaurant has been open for about 5 weeks.  The menu is well thought out with a diverse list of items from which to choose.  We tried almost everything but it would be a great place to come and have one or two items and some drinks.  The back of the menu suggested alcohol pairings for each of the menu items and are available in 2 or 5 ounce tasting sizes.

It certainly was worth the trip to the other side of town to try Clawson's restaurant.  A great menu with all items very well executed!"}

{"text":"For their one-year anniversary, David Clawson Restaurant set aside one night for 50% off food. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try this acclaimed restaurant for a bargain.

David Clawson Restaurant is at the far end of the Anthem area of Henderson.

The ambiance is rather casual, as is the stated attire - but I would have felt underdressed in a T-shirt and jeans, which I thankfully avoided.

It's a considerable drive for anyone who doesn't live in Anthem, but it's well worth it. Even at regular prices, this small plates / \"tapas\" restaurant easily trumps similar Strip restaurants in terms of price and flavor. The vast menu was too much for the two of us to sample in its entirety, but we gave it our best shot:

- High Mountain oolong tea ($5): pleasant enough without sugar, gave me enough alertness to enjoy the rest of the meal. It provided all that I could ask for.

- Albacore shots (blackboard special, $6 normal price): truffle ponzu, avocado, and jalapeño. I had more than enough heat from half of the jalapeño slice, but don't skip it entirely or else you'll lack a key part of the flavor combo.

- Brussels sprouts ($9): bacon, mustard, and manchego. A delightfully crunchy and savory dish that's shareable.

- Tiger shrimp ($11): chorizo, jicama, chipotle, and cilantro over a corn puree. Tasty but not especially memorable.

- Hokkaido scallop ceviche ($13): mango, finger lime, and pickled onions. The sourness of the finger limes (the crunchy and sour \"caviar\") played nicely against the sweetness of the fresh mango. Along with the scallop, I also had a sip of the 2 oz tasting portion of the paired Albariño wine ($4), which seemed just fine to my untrained palate.

- Garlic noodles ($7): solid but not remarkable. The noodles aren't al dente - no issue because I haven't had garlic noodles served al dente - but they also aren't distinctively better than versions that I've had elsewhere.

- Pork belly ($9): some of the best that I've had in a while, perhaps ever. The sauce was a classic apple pairing, but the achara (julienne carrots and papaya) was a twist that reminds me of banh mi sandwiches, although there's an additional ginger flavor in this version. The pork itself is meaty, tender and very flavorful, although it could've used more than just a slight crunch to the skin.

- Veal cheek ($14): bacon, shiitake, and kaboucha squash. Resembles some beef ragouts that I've had, but it's not as sour and the meat is certainly far more tender while having a distinctive non-beefy flavor.

- Crab cake ($15): spinach, grain mustard, and lemon. The only item where I'll say that I prefer another place's rendition. There's plenty of crab meat, and the complementary components were nice, but I thought it was a little on the salty side and could've even used a little more crab meat instead of having that salty crust. I could be biased, but that's my take.

- Foie gras ($19): a modest portion of seared liver over a poached pear with shallot jam and some ginger. Perhaps this purer form of foie gras is not for me because I didn't get too much flavor out of it even when I ate it alone to avoid the slightly overpowering pear. It did open my eyes (and palate) to how important the addition of different livers are in the other versions of foie gras that I've tried, so it was worth it even though it was a flavor letdown.

- Duck confit ($13). The subtle honey and the blueberry complemented the fantastic duck meat. I couldn't detect the lemongrass that was reportedly used, but I didn't long for it. Next to the pork belly, this was one of my favorites of the night. A nice peak to end the savory portion of the meal.

- Banana \"tiramisu\" ($8): the least endearing of the excellent desserts. Didn't carry the traditional coffee flavor, but the banana cake and bruleed bananas were yummy anyway. Our server said that it's only been around for a couple of weeks.

- Chocolate \"bombe\" ($9): per our server, a \"brand new\" menu addition. The thick layer of chocolate mousse, thin layer of crunchy hazelnut, puddle of grand marnier sauce, and crunchy orange-flavored tuile were all fantastic elements, and they combined to form a masterpiece.

- Sticky apricot pudding ($9): served with a nice vanilla cream and a sublime rum toffee sauce. I'm sure we finished the entire pool of the toffee. This was the best dessert and it seems to be a menu mainstay.

A complimentary soft coconut/caramel toffee arrived with the bill. It was also delicious. And paying that bill was as easy as 1-2-3. Specifically - with tax and with the tip based on the undiscounted prices - $123 for a feast for two.

Service was a bit slow throughout the night, but it was nice to be visited by pastry chef Maggie and by chef David Clawson himself. I think we were happy enough to linger anyway.

I'll certainly be back. Maybe for the second anniversary, yeah?"}
{"text":"You're doubling down on your skill if you plan on people ordering 5 plates each and plan on executing them all very well. They succeeded. 

All future sausages I consume will be compared to the boudin sausage. I learned what a sausage is supposed to be. Not overly salty; loosely packed enough that you can see the fat exude and retreat as you squeeze the al dente casing.

The achiote quail is another world. We ate this last, and I didn't think it would compare to the other dishes. The way the marinated quail works with the jalapeno simple syrup and the fig... it was a revelation. A revelation!

The foie gras is stellar. Great on it's own but it could use a crisp foil like toast points. Great item, they didn't mess it up. Similarly, the bone marrow was tasty, as marrow tends to be and it did include toast points to contrast with the fat. 

The veal cheek was well made, the duck confit was well made. Great takes on classics.

Finally, Shawn, our server, gauged us well. We were given our space but when we started to ask more questions he started to open up and help us with more selections, you could tell he loved what he did for a living. You could tell that they all cared. Refugees from the mammoth strip joints.  It's a small staff, and if I lived in that far corner of Anthem I would look forward to getting to know them."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great atmosphere. Each small plate was excellent and our server was extremely knowledgable about each dish. Such a great addition to the Anthem area, Strip quality level restaurant at a very reasonable price. Highly recommend! We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I am presently drunk on food but that will not hamper my ability to review this restaurant with the upmost accuracy. I'd like to start from the beginning, two hours ago, when my husband and I were debating where to eat for dinner. Not the same ol' chain restaurants in The District, he said. I did what any modern-day woman would do. Yelp! I stumbled upon, by sheer luck, David Clawson. I read a couple reviews, viewed a few images and was sold. The experience we had far exceeded both our expectations. Each item we ordered from the tapas-style menu (artichoke, sea bass, lo mein, bison meatball, steak, chicken, salmon) was delicious. The chicken was a little tough and the salmon (served cold) was not our favorite. The banana bread tiramisu will blow your mind. Literally. Mind blown! And then, the after dinner surprise presented with the check...what is that? IT'S SO GOOD!!! Needless to say, we will be back to have another, what I can only describe as an incredible meal once again."}
{"text":"This little venture off the strip was absolutely worth the trip!  I went in and sat at the Chef's Bar and ordered from their small plate menu.  I absolutely love this concept since I am always a food scavenger and want to try EVERYTHING off of everyone else's plate ;)  I decided to go adventurous and was not disappointed (sweet breads, lamb, chicken, cheese plate)  The lamb chop was amazing, I loved the combo of spicy and cooling with the different sauces that came with it, the sweet breads were wrapped in bacon and who doesn't love bacon?!  The cheese plate was a great ending to my meal with the pairings of figs, honey and macrona almonds.  Speaking of pairings, on the back side of the menu there are different wine sake and beer pairings that are recommended with each plate...I love this because sometimes I'm not too sure what to order and this takes the guessing out of it!  I also like that they offered smaller pours so you can order the pairing with just about everything and not have to booze too hard haha! The staff were also pretty knowledgeable on what to choose, oh! and at the Chef's bar you get to watch one of the cooks make your food to order! 
I'm happy to see such a neat place open up and will definitely stop by on my next trip here.  I love to support small local business and really recommend this little gem to anyone in the area. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food and great atmosphere and we will be back!!!!! Please, please support them!! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Continues to be one of the most outstanding, creative restaurants around.  David should be on the PBS series Chefs.  His presentation is gorgeous, his selections delicious and unusual pairings of herbs, spices and entres.   Megs totally original deserts are worth the trip alone!"}
{"text":"Easily a 5 star review!  Eric R. and I went on a double date with Ben W. and Jaclyn L. that we arranged a week ago while at a happy hour.  We all wanted to try David Clawson and luckily had a free night to do so.  Everything on the menu looked good, including the specials.  We could have ordered almost anything!  Luckily, we were able to agree on all dishes, and there was only one I did not try because it had pork.

Our server looked exactly like Sandra Bullock (and she told me everyone says that which I figured).  She was so nice and very attentive.  We started off with the Japanese milk bread (which I forgot to take a picture of) which was tasty.  Then, Jaclyn L. and I both got the hamachi shot, which had hamachi, avocado, wasabi leaf, truffle, and jalapeno.  It was delicious!

Our next set of dishes included the duck confit with blueberry sauce, which fell off the bone and had crispy skin, the shrimp with chorizo and corn (I did not try this but everyone else liked it), and the hamachi salad with frisee, daikon-carrot pickles, and red chile miso.  I love frisee (favorite lettuce!) so this was awesome.  It also had thai bird chile.

Our next round had the garlic lo mein, tuna tataki, and quail with fig.  Everything was delicious!  We ended with the sticky apricot pudding and it was gone in no time. I really wanted to try the scallops but did not get enough votes, so I will have to eat here again next time I get back to LV.  We were given salted caramels covered in coconut with our check, which were soft and creamy.  The server swiped the credit cards at the table, just like in Europe!  That is the first place we have seen that in the U.S.  Overall the price was incredibly reasonable, with each couple paying just over $50 with tip!  

For a suburban spot that is not well known, the service and food are excellent!  All four of us liked everything we ate and saw many other menu items of interest.  Definitely give DC a try.  Closed Sundays and Mondays."}
{"text":"David Clawson restaurant in Henderson, NV. Exquisite food and service. Chef David is personable and gracious. Previously owner of a members only restaurant in Vail, CO. The food is flawless! Amazing restaurant for foodies south of Las Vegas. Small plates including Berkshire porky belly, scallops, oysters with caviar, duck confit, seared foie gras with a shallot jam... Beautiful presentation and big taste!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation online and requested seats at the 20-seat chef's counter.  This new American small plates restaurant has been praised by just about every Las Vegas reviewer since its October, 2014 opening. We started off by ordering Mary's free range chicken which included prunes, capers and olives plus an order of garlic and more garlic noodles that were very good. These were followed by orders of asparagus with meyer lemon, romaine lettuce and white anchovy that did not do much for me and sea bass with white miso, kabayaki and bok choy that was excellent.  Perhaps the best was saved for last when we ordered the sticky apricot pudding with vanilla cream and rum toffee. With our check we received a pair of toasted caramel, chocolate and almond truffles. Though each dish was impeccably prepared using the highest ingredients, we found none that included a wow factor, but most were very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Hubby and i ate here last night and it was truly an amazing meal.
At first glance the menu seemed a bit overwhelming, but once we figured it out with some guidance from our server we realized it was ingenious! We inquired about a tasting menu, but you need to request that in advance if you want to do a chefs tasting.
So basically the way the menu is, you can create your own experience. We set up our dinner like a 5 course menu with wine pairings. 
First course we had oysters and the hamachi shot with the J sparking.  Delicious! The oysters had the chefs version of a cocktail sauce which complimented the oysters without overpowering.  The truffle ponzu that the hamachi came in was killer. Yes, we drank every last drop lol.
Second course we had the whitefish and rice with uni and ikura. We paired this course with the honey pot white blend.  This course was just as amazing as the first course! The fish was cooked perfectly and came in a delicate flavorful broth.  The rice, omg I want this dish right now...it was like a creamy risotto with the saltiness of the ikura and creaminess of the uni, perfection!
Next course we had the bone marrow with pinot noir.  It was probably my least favorite thing, but only bc I'm not a big fan of bone marrow. But my husband was a fan and said it was really good bone marrow.
Fourth course we had the tenderloin and brussel sprouts paired with the cab. 
We ended our meal with a cheese and the apricot pudding. We even got a cheesecake on the house  since they  had 1 left and were about to close...score! 
Our server was awesome as well. He was very thorough and knowledgeable as well as personable.  We could tell he really respected the chef and was a great representation of the the restaurant. 
When the bill came we were pretty shocked. We really thought we went all out and it came out be under $150! A meal like this on the strip would be atleast $250+. Amazing!! We are excited to go back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at David Clawson. Truly a hidden gem. Yes, the portions are small but the purpose of the food is to enjoy their flavor, not to shovel down a massive amount. By the end of the meal, we were very satisfied and full. Great experience, very unique & personalized!"}
{"text":"Deep in Anthem in a strip mall, you will find David Clawson Restaurant (DCR). Not an ideal location for the experience I was about to have, but I can overlook that!   My husband and I walked in and the woman at the door was very friendly and seated us right away. There are booths on one side of the restaurant and tables on the other, while a counter takes control of the center of the restaurant. The overall feel of the place was comfortable. The decor is simple and probably the only thing I would tweak is that. Simple, borderline minimal. While it presented a clean fresh look, I do think they could add a little something to make it feel a bit more cozy.

Our waiter Sean was very helpful, even charming I would say! He was very patient with all my questions about the menu.  The menu....one side is the liquor. They serve beer, wine and sake (perhaps no liquor license yet?) The other side is the food. The interesting part is this: 1) you can have any of their alcohol in 2 oz., 5 oz., or bottle servings and 2) each alcohol is paired with each item on the menu and they are categorized on each side of the menu so it's completely dummy proofed for us! Haha! The wines were delicious and paired so nicely to each course, as I suppose David Clawson intended them to be! Well played Sir! 

The food: unbelievable!!!! Each dish was phenomenal! They begin by bringing out a piece of salmon sashimi, beautifully cut and placed on a slab of pink Himalayan salt (my guess) as perhaps a palette cleanser? Not sure but it was like a sneak preview of things to come and it was amazing! We ordered: 
-oysters...amazing
-pork belly...melts in your mouth. Served with a pear sauce. Amazing!
-tuna...served on rice crackers, amazing
-duck confit...seriously the best thing I had! Served in a jus with blueberries and a risotto cake. The flavor with the blueberries was perfect 
-sea bass...phenom!!!! miso broth with bok choy and mushroom. The broth itself could have been a meal!! 
-crab cake....more crab than cake. Moist and light. 
-potatoes ...heaven!!!! That's it! 
-Gouda cheese plate-if you like truffle it's amazing. My husband does, I don't. But the little crackers served with this plate are so good!!
-irish crime brûlée...I am a huge creme brûlée eater. It's one of my faves. This was one of my favorites ever! It's amazing! 
And finally....Sean brought out two little truffles with our check. He said they were white chocolate basil rolled in crunched pistachios. Ok! I'm not a big truffle fan. Bite. OMG!!!!!!! Best thing ever!!!!! The creaminess of the white chocolate center, the perfectly balanced yet intense flavor of the basil and the subtle crunch of the pistachio's.....I haven't stopped thinking about these little pockets of heaven!!!! They are seriously so amazing!! They should sell them!!!!!!! 
So there we have it folks!!!! The food was some of the best I've had, and I've had lots of food!!!! The staff was helpful and friendly. The chef met us at the door to say goodnight as we left. It really was amazing all around!!!' We will be back very shortly!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how anyone can serve tapas in the first place, and then make it so perfectly!  All sorts of meats, fish, veggies, pastas, desserts, sides, and all prepared in so many assorted ways, and in any combination that the customer wants.  And it all tasted great!!  
They seem to have over 20 separate \"regular\" dishes on the menu and a chalk board full of specials.  We suggest bringing friends so that you can get a wider variety of foods and share them around the table to keep the total food intake to a reasonable amount.
Only minor inconvenience was a meat course on the \"Specials\" list was brought out later than all the other meat courses, which we still consider to be the main course.  That let the planned side courses get a bit cold while we waited.
The staff, and Chef David, are all great, and they take time to make every meal memorable!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best in town.  The attention to detail in the plating makes you really appreciate the dishes even more.  The food is of the finest quality and the personalized service of greeting us by name goes a long way. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the best off Strip eateries in Vegas; period.

In a nutshell, beautifully presented, sharable dishes.  Seasonal ingredients all aimed at with razor focus on the natural flavor of a key component.  A nod towards Asia.   Beverage pairings further support the focus.  Casual contemporary ambiance.  Low prices.

Go with the goal of ordering a LOT of dishes while passing on the super deluxe \"omygodse\".   While tempting to try nearly the entire menu, unlike most prefix options, this one is not coursed out properly for flavors to build, compliment, or contrast rather just a hodgepodge of dishes.   It is best to order in \"flights\" of a few sharable dishes at a time.

Tip:  When sharing, order one dish for every two diners.

Some of the best include the simple noodles (garlic, more garlic) pairs the classic garlic noodle with pecorino cheese.  Great salinity with a nice umame finish.   The al dente texture of the noodles contrasting gently against the creamy melting cheese.   An outstanding crab (jumbo lump crab cake with red pepper and basil) delivers great, sweet crab flavor accented by a hint of Old Bay seasoning. The clean pepper flavor supporting the oceanic complexity of the crab cake.  Very little filler.  Finally a beautifully braised veal cheek, surrounded by its braising jus, bacon adds depth, black trumpets, earthiness, kabocha, sweetness all enhancing the mild beefyness of the veal.

The beverage program is different.  A beverage has been selected for each dish.  Available as a 2oz sample size or a 5oz pour, they are intended to further enhance the dish.  The problem, when ordering multiple dishes, the pairings often clash.  Skill or great personal knowledge of wines and beers is required to put the courses together properly.  Servers lack this ability.  This is the restaurants weakness.

Positives and fun far outweigh the negatives making David Clawson a destination and worthy of the drive to happening Hendertucky."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying this place and it did not dissapoint. 

We made reservations through Yelp seat saver. I reccomend making reservations since it's not a big place. We went late on a Friday and it was packed but they had our seat waiting for us and we got right in.

Our server Sean was great! Friendly and very knowledgable. We started with a bottle of wine, very reasonably priced. We decided to start with three items and go from there. We had the duck, beef cheek and brussle sprouts. They were all cooke perfectly! Very tender meats, the sprouts were fantastic with bacon mixed in. We had room for more so we added a Hamachi shooter and foie gras. The Hamachi shooter with avocado and jalapeno was perfect and light, second favorite only to the duck. All the sauces were very good.

With 5 items and the bottle of wine everything came to only about $100. I think next time we will take the waiter suggestion of getting 5oz wine pours of different wine to go with each different dish. It probaly would have only cost us maybe $15 more and they have great pairing suggestions.

The only reason this was 4 instead of 5 is because the place is a little cramped for my liking. Tables are pretty close together."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a four course meal Tonite with wine pairings. After an amuse from the kitchen of salmon belly served on a Himalayan salt block, I enjoyed the seared shrimp served over corn and slivers of spanish style chorizo delicious with the Morgan Chardonnay pairing. 

Next I enjoyed a treat of rich buttery fois gras served over a silky slab of pear and topped with shallot jam that contributed the right amount of acidity to balance the richness of the duck liver. 

The beef filet was cooked to perfect doneness and complimented with sautéed spinach and wild mushroom with a balsamic reduction sauce. The Franciscan Cab pairing  held its own with these strong flavors. 

I finished the meal with the cheese course comprised of a French triple creme cheese that was perfectly ripe paired with brûlée figs, Marcona almonds, honey and quince paste. Delightful way to finish off your glass of wine. 

This restaurant is a welcome addition to the Anthem neighborhood."}
{"text":"Setting aside givens such as skill, sourcing, setting, and service it is oftentimes commitment and confidence that separates a 'great' restaurant from one that is simply 'good,' and on Saturday night it was in fact those two factors that introduced myself and a friend to the greatness of David Clawson Restaurant.  Eponymously named for the Chef who cut his teeth at any number of the nation's finest resorts and located inside a former strip-mall sushi bar way out in Anthem the David Clawson Restaurant experience begins with warm welcomes at the door and quickly whisked away to a Chef's Counter seats amidst modest décor as light alt-rock played overhead it would be mere moments before service began - a light amuse of tender salmon belly atop a salt rock whetting appetites even before a menu was in hand.

A surprisingly casual space with jovial, well informed service provided by a young man named Shawn, it was with wide eyes and large appetites that we perused the menu and although minor changes have already occurred from that presented online it was to no lack of options that we were tempted, the eventual order entailing 22 individual items with canapé, amuse, and mignardise presenting twenty-five plates at a total of just under $240 before gratuity - many of the plates far larger than one would expect and all together a tremendous amount of food, much of it exceptional in many ways.

Deferring to the kitchen on order of arrival it was a creamy tongue of urchin bathed in brine that started our meal and beginning light before transitioning heavy the progression was well crafted while pacing was perfect, the lightly sweet bread and soup that followed both impressive with a crab-stuffed roast tomato assertively speaking to the end of summer with eloquence that bridged nicely to the smoky-sweet mushroom toast that followed.

Treated next to tender scallops atop sushi grade rice with citrus up-front it was onward to a hamachi salad brightened by pomegranate vinaigrette that things progressed and although the foie gras was not quite as creamy as one would have hoped atop tender pears the crab cake and confit that followed provided quick recovery to say the least, the former at least eighty percent sweet crustacean with gentle spice while the later was absolutely textbook as crackling skin gave way to tender, gamey flesh.

Occasionally at lack for course descriptions as the team worked at frenetic pace to keep up with what was apparently their busiest night yet it would be a nearly impossible task to decide whether creamy rice, house made boudin, pork belly, or handmade lo mein were most impressive of the plates that followed and although chicken proved overcooked and overwhelmed by cilantro the dishes that followed were an immediate return to form, the creamy potatoes particularly beautiful while I marveled at how Chef Clawson allowed the lamb's funk to shine whereas so many other chef's in the city opt to rein it in and render it similar to beef, a protein equally well prepared at the chef's counter as sambal plus balsamic played a point and counterpoint game of heat and sweet.

At this point well sated but happy to enjoy more it was in a duo of nicely aged cheeses that we indulged and although I'd have preferred more time before desserts arrived the pastry kitchen proved just as excellent as the savory line with a delicate crème brûlée tinged in booze starting things off before \"sticky apricot love\" offered itself up as a contender for 2014's best dessert, the steamy English classic reinvented with aromatic nuances adding balance to the intensely sweet sauce I soon found myself scooping up with a spoon.

Completing the evening with a duo of chocolates, the first a milky ganache atop dark feuilletine while the complimentary truffle served with the bill tickled the palate with herbal notes amidst a creamy base, it was with big smiles and graciousness for feedback that the team bid us farewell and with a long drive back to Summerlin to discuss the experience suffice it to say that a return visit is already in the works, a seasonal change in the menu the only thing holding us back.

Open for only five weeks, and just now finding its audience, David Clawson Restaurant is one of those rare places firing on all cylinders fresh from the gate.  Admittedly following a 'career greatest hits' format so far, according to our server, it will be intriguing to see how the cuisine develops over time and particularly how the various omakase options evolve as word spreads.  Already impressive, particularly given the skeleton crew of just Clawson and a sous-chef working the line while pastry is managed by a very talented young woman in her own regard, one can only hope that the quality remains high while the menu undergoes frequent change - the forty-five minute drive easily justified for an experience of this quality at such a great price."}
{"text":"I went here with family a few days after Thanksgiving and we had a wonderful meal. Our server was so friendly and really knowledgeable and courteous. We started with the butternut squash soup and it was excellent. We ordered a TON of other dishes that I won't go through one by one, so you'll have to trust me that they were all outstanding. My favorites were the lo mein noodles with lots of garlic, the sea bass in miso broth, the duck (with blueberry! so unexpectedly delicious), the beef tenderloin, and the quail. I have it on good authority that this is the best restaurant off the strip!"}
{"text":"Invited a couple to join the wife and I to check out David Clawson last night. Classy decor with booths lining one wall, large central \"bar-style\" seating, and tables next to the external glass wall. 

We were met at the door, opened by the hostess who seemingly expected us (we did have a reservation) and guided us to our seats. Server quickly took and retrieved our drink order. 

The menu is visually simple, with a single descriptor followed by a brief inventory of it's contents. The plates are small and meant to be served in several courses. Our party chose to pursue the menu tapas-style and sampled nearly 2/3 of the menu: 

bread                    milk bread, plugra butter, alaea red salt                                     
pork                      pork belly, green papaya, raisins                                                 oyster                   kusshi, ponzu, daikon, chives     
tuna                      ahi, scallop, tobiko, yuzu                                                              
liver                      foie gras, pear, ginger, shallot jam                                               
crab                      jumbo lump, persimmon, torpedo onions                  
lamb                     chop, muhammara, cumin, sumac                                             
chicken                organic, achiote, green chile, macaroni     
beef                      tenderloin, sambal, balsamic, trumpet mushroom                  
duck                     leg confit, lemon, honey, blueberry                                  
rice                       acquerello risotto, lemon, mascarpone    
scallop                  hokkaido, tamari, finger lime, ikura                                          
potato                   yukon gold, garlic, ham hock     
noodles                shanghai, garlic, more garlic                                                                                         
fruit *misnomer*   sticky apricot love, vanilla cream, rum toffee       
cheese                 epoisses, fig, truffle honey, quince  

All dishes were exquisitely prepared, visually and taste-wise. The party enjoyed each plate so much, we were unable to identify a favorite or a dud. Just good, well prepared food. 

We left absolutely satisfied. Our server Sean and his crew were wonderfully attentive. Chef David stopped by our table a few times and was very personable and generous. 
We will definitely be back to try what we missed and to sample more of David Clawson's evolving seasonal menu."}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews and I was disappointed. Food wasn't that great in my opinion. We had the bread and soup to start with, it wasn't anything special. The chicken was pretty dry. The beef was the only thing that was decent. We also did the wine pairing and tried the sake. The sake was overpriced for what it was. Definitely wouldn't give this place another try."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday night at 6:30PM. Restaurant is clean, modern, and has a great wrap around bar in the center of the restaurant. There wasn't much of a crowd at 6:30PM, but it started to fill up a little bit after 7PM. It's a small/intimate restaurant (with some booths on one side, regular tables on another, and about 15 seats at the bar). There were people seated to the tables next to us, and we could hear their conversations unfortunately (that's the only downside to this restaurant). 

Food was AMAZING!! 

we ordered: 
- scallops ceviche: anything with ceviche means the meat is raw, and the juices from the lemon \"cook\" it. This was the best ceviche I've had. It was slightly sweet, had a little sweet balsamic vinegrete in there, with sweet pickled onions, mango slices, advocado, and a thai chili for each of the four scallops. It was beautifully presented too, and really easy to fit on your spoon, and to eat it whole (which is recommended because the flavors of the mango and chili really go well together with the scallop). 

- brussel sprouts: sweet balsamic-like brussel sprouts cut in half length wise, with bacon or some kind of pork. it wasn't bitter, like brussel sprouts can be, and the outside was nicely crispy with the balsamic (i think) caramelization.  
 
- lamb: we ordered it medium rare, and even though it looked rare, it was not. IT WAS SOO DELICIOUS. also pricey at $18 (and remember this is a tapas restaurant so the order of lamb didn't come with two sides), but totally worth it. Lamb can be gamey, but this wasn't. 
 
- bread: also delicious. it was so cute! it tasted a little like those Hawaiian rolls you get for Thanksgiving when you're too lazy to bake actual rolls, but way better. It also came with salted butter, which was simple and surprisingly amazing. I need to start doing that with my own buttered toast. 
 
- crab cake: also very good. came with a ton of actual crab meat that looked like crab meat. Most crab cakes are mostly bread crumbs, and mashed crab meat (or it looks like mashed crab meat because you can't actually see the crab meat). This was not like that. My description doesn't make it sound appetizing, but it was delicious and perfectly crispy on the outside. 

No room for dessert, which was sad. They also have a board of specials, which I definitely want to try for my next visit.  

Service: guy was super nice & helpful. We explained it was our first time, and the server gave us a list of recommendations for us to choose from. 

It's definitely pricey, total for two people came out to $59 (pre tax & pre tip), but it's so worth itttttt!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at David Clawson's.  We did drive about 40 minutes to get there, and while it was a very nice experience, considering all the other LV restaurants, not sure we would do it again.  Please don't take this to mean we had any  regrets either.  It was a wonderful meal.

Food was very good on balance, however being honest I didn't think it was as fantastic as many other reviewers here.  Miso Sea bass was to die for.  Ahi tuna dish, considering all the ingredients, I felt would have had more flavor.  I also was not terribly fond of the flavor of the duck.  We had 4-5 other small plates, and I was happy with all.

No hard liquor, so we could not have a drink before dinner, which was a bit disappointing.  The server was also very complete in his description of the dishes.   His service, and attententiveness, was top notch.

As this is a new restaurant, I am sure they will only improve, and thus we will try again at a future date."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last night after seeing reviews on Yelp and our newspaper food critic.  We were not disappointed!  Everything we had was amazing!  I could eat the Parker House bread with pulgra butter and alaea salt all day!  We took Chef's recommendation and went down the menu with starters, meats and dessert.  My husband had the soup and I had the Brussels Sprouts.  Delicious!  We also had one of the weekly specials, Hamachi Shot.  Wow!  Best fish appetizer ever!  

We then had the ahi and quail.  My husband loved his ahi, but the quail was on the bone and chewy...that was my only complaint.  The fois gras on the poached pear is out of this world!!  Best fois gras I've ever had!

It's not just the presentation that's outstanding but the quality of the food and the taste.  Servers are knowledgeable and friendly.  The hostess is fabulous.  Pastry chef Meg delivers her creations to you and loves to tease when you are scraping the sauce off the Chocolate Bombe plate to savor each delicious morsel.  A different tapas experience but so worth it.  I dub this a neighborhood gem and we will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The menu is eclectic and a little confusing at first, but don't that stop you.  Order everything you can!  You can't go wrong.  Highlights included baby back ribs, yellowtail salad, grilled shrimp and lo mein.  Desserts were fantastic as well.  Bring a bunch of friends, so you can try as many dishes as possible.  

The service is impeccable as well.  My group was visiting from out of town (without a car), and our waiter went above and beyond to help us get a taxi on a busy Saturday night when it was not easy to get a taxi to come out to Anthem to pick us up.  That was on top of doing a terrific job throughout dinner of guiding us through the menu and being very attentive on a busy night.  I can't say enough good things about our experience."}
{"text":"Wow, where do I even begin?? This was an absolute wonderful dining experience that I hope to repeat again soon. The 5 star reviews are well deserved. We arrived at 6 and were seated immediately. We asked for a booth but were told they were all reserved for a party. Not a big deal but the tables for 2 are very close together and don't offer any privacy. Other than that, I have no complaints. 

Our server, Beth, came over right away and welcomed us. She explained the small plates concept and recommended a few things according to our taste. We started with 4 plates and ended up ordering 8, including dessert. 

We had the yellowtail salad which was basically yellowtail sashimi on some greens with a spicy sauce. Then they brought out the Ahi tuna tataki which was excellent (we ended up ordering a second). Perfectly seared tuna on a fried wonton with avocado and a wonderful sauce. Next up was the garlic lo mein noodles, if you love garlic you wont be disappointed. Then we had the potatoes with ham and chives and the crabcake.  The crabcake was very good, very little filling and large pieces of lump crab. 

Now I am saving the best for last. The seabass in miso broth was nothing short of incredible. It was one of the best dishes I have ever had, and that is saying a lot! The fish was cooked to perfection. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside sitting in the most incredible miso broth. I could have eaten 2 or 3. We ended this fantastic meal with the apricot sticky pudding. Another incredible dish worthy of the 5 stars. 

This was just a fantastic meal with great service. Beth did a great job checking on us and making sure we were happy. I will definitely be returning to David Clawson for more of his food."}
{"text":"Try the garlic noodles!!! It is warm and inviting. It is a great spot for a date night in the neighborhood. They were very accommodating for a large group dinner and fixed menu. We had an elegant time without it being stuffy."}
{"text":"Simply Amazing!!
From the very start to the finish!! 
Staff is very gracious! Chef himself is incredible.  beautiful ambience. Food is so so so good. Must come!!"}
{"text":"I had read all the positive reviews and my mother a Henderson resident had been there several times and had an enjoyable experience each time.  Therefore, I had high expectations for this restaurant, unfortunately my experience did not remotely meet those expectations.

Service/Decor were fine 4/5, but the food was awful.  We ordered the chef's table, so its is supposedly creative dishes that are not on the regular menu. I'll go course by course:

1) Beet Salad w/ Goat Cheese: Best Dish of the Night 4/5. but then again something I make at home, so nothing special.

Unfortunately straight down hill from the beet salad.

2)Jerk Chicken drumstick:  Dry, not well seasoned.  I'm spoiled my having a wonderful Dominican restaurant nearby, but this version of jerk chicken if that's what they were attempting was not well executed.  Hole in the wall ma/pa place 1 DC 0.  1/5

3) Seared Salmon in a Miso Broth with Shrimp:  A fishy fish like Salmon in a salty brine like miso.  The miso did nothing but serve to accentuate the fishiness of the Salmon, yuck.  I actually sent it back, its the 1st dish I've sent back in years.  I literally couldn't eat the dish it was disgusting.  0/5

The salmon dish was replaced with a veal cheek dish, which was technically well prepared, but nothing special 3/5.

4) Sirloin Steak with Blue Cheese topping:  Steak was a perfect medium rare, but under seasoned.  I'm not a blue cheese fan so I had to scrap that off.  I make a better steak at home and I'm not some super chef, just a competent home cook.  2/5

5)Chocolate Mousse w/ Grand Marnier, not a fan of messing with a classic like chocolate mousse.  The addition of Grand Marnier was OK, but I would have preferred the mousse without it.  However, the mousse was thick and gummy.  Mousse should be light airy fluffy melt in your mouth, not something you use to apply postage to a package.  I find it astounding that their desert chef couldn't even get a simple mousse correct.  I love chocolate mousse and didn't finish mine.  1/5

I'm sorry to be such a downer, but my experience at this restaurant was uniformly terrible and I would not recommend it to anyone."}
