{"text":"Food here is pretty decent and a good portion. The only downside is that is quite costly for fish and chips. You're looking at $15-$20 for a single meal"}
{"text":"Danny's is the only place in Markham that does Fish 'n' Chips the best! Great food, reasonably priced, very friendly service...the owner has seen me there 3 times per month, so clearly he is doing something good :-) The decor may seem outdated but it adds to the authenticity."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips place! i highly recommend and friendly service too!  I come here every now and then as I find their batter is not too thick and fries are not greasy.  definitely coming back."}
{"text":"oh yummy! To be honest, to say I was picky with fish/chips is an understatement!  Danny's is fresh! The batter is crisp with the right amount of crunch the chips are just like in the UK ... you can tell its made from fresh cut potatoes (no frozen fries here!)  And the staff just take it over the top ... so friendly, like family.  ask about the spicy batter next time!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips.  Service was quick and friendly.  Nice mom and pop shop, fan of the fries.  Prices reasonable as well, cheaper than the downtown ones and just as good."}
{"text":"after old galley in richmond hill closed i am without a regular haunt for fish and chips. had high hopes for this place. fries were a bit undercooked (had a bit of a potatoey flavor you get when the outside is cooked but the inside ain't).  the portion of halibut was odd. it was VERY flat for a piece of halibut and flaky to the point of falling apart when you cut into it.  coleslaw was awful. lacked flavor and was really bland.  13.99 is a bit much considering not up to snuff with most places I've been  better than getting a mcd filet o' fish but does not hold its own against other places I've been"}
{"text":"Been there a few times. The place is old but clean. I always prefer halibut over cod, and they fresh and nicely battered here. Not the best I've tried but this place is probably the best in the area."}
{"text":"Danny's never disappoints. Fast, fresh, friendly. 2-n-1 Haddock is always a winner. There are cheaper places nearby but none are better than Danny's."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here the other night for fish and chips. We both really enjoyed our meal. The fish was soooo good. The portion size was reasonable and the quality was really good. We got fries and coleslaw too - I didn't really like the fries that much, but my friend did. The coleslaw was really good too. I would definitely recommend this place - I can see why it's been around for so long. We'll definitely be back. The people there are really nice too."}
{"text":"Okay as I mentioned Danny Bs had issues, but we gave them another try and their services and food has done a complete turn around.  The batter they are using is a little different, crispy and fish was done perfectly.  The service has changed for the better 100%.  Great job Danny Bs, my husband and I really wanted you guys to be successful in our little town.  Love the hushpuppy added to the basket too, nice touch.  Everyone, that didn't like them at first, give them another try!"}
{"text":"Definitely a must try in the area!  Danny's is tucked away in a small plaza by Kennedy and Highway 7.  With all the traffic on Highway 7 now I almost always try to avoid this plaza.  You may have missed this small plaza before but there's now a Dollarama here.    This is a true hidden gem in Markham.  The halibut is really good and the fries portion is just right.  The only downside is the small menu, but I get the same thing every time I'm here.    The tables are small here and will only fit small parties - for this reason I usually get takeout."}
{"text":"Very solid proper British style fish and chips.  Lots of choices of fish.  Fries were tasty but nothing special.  Mushy green peas are a must for that authentic British experience!"}
{"text":"Have been here for a few times already and they are always the best I found in Markham. The batter is always so crispy and light but not oily. I prefer their cod over halibut. However, the fries need some improvement. What I usually do is to make it as poutine which the gravy makes it better :)"}
{"text":"The local fish and chips place in the area is somewhere that I'll frequent a couple of times a year. It's not the best fish and chips ever, but it's nearby, cheap, fast and friendly.  The fish here is the superior of the halves here, because the batter is crispy and hot, and the fish is fresh and plentiful for the price. I've tried multiple varieties (catfish, tilapia, etc.), but I usually end up coming back to the halibut. The fries are OK. They're big enough, plentiful and fresh cut, but they're usually more on the greasier/chewier side rather than fresh and crispy. Still very edible, just not top of the line (i.e. I usually won't finish them). Worth a stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The ONLY place in Markham that has the BEST fish and chips (poutine). Service is super personable and Ike puts a lot of TLC into prepping our meals. I highly recommend this place to anyone that's got that craving. This is the place to visit."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10 -- Value: 8/10 -- Service: 7/10 -- Ambiance/DÃ©cor: 7/10  Having had the haddock, Danny's is better than Blue Nose and Halibut House in my opinion (comparing Markham fish and chips restaurants). It's not anything superlative, but it was the only place out of the three that fried the fish enough to give it just the right about of crispiness and colour; Blue Nose and Halibut House were a bit on the lighter, softer side.   I've never had mushy peas before and it tastes exactly as you would expect mushy peas to taste. It could probably have used a little salt, but it's an interesting thing (that I've since learned is a traditional side dish for fish and chips) and I kinda want more.   The restaurant and service are really only footnotes. You don't come here for a fancy restaurant or amazing service. It's really just about the food and I think it delivers."}
{"text":"Great Fish and Chips  We ate there 11/26 for lunch, loved it.  I'm from the south coast of Georgia - I'd put this place right up there with our coastal fried foods.  Batter was true beer batter, fish fresh as well as the oil.  You couldn't taste the oil which is the way it should be.  I normally try and behave but couldn't stop eating the fries. Service was great.  We'll be headed back again.  Next time I'll add a bloody mary to order."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple of times. Their haddock fish and chips is delicious and service is great"}
{"text":"My turn to review this LOCAL Fish & Chips resto.  Let's see how many people will agree or disagree, but nonetheless I hope it will provide a preview for you.  I can see POTENTIAL as I visit late afternoon seeing the young waitress get off from the booth to greet me as she was watching Rafael Nadal struggle during his match shown on a large LCD.  The place almost has an English Pub feel with the AGED settings to show for it.  It reminds me of the nearby neighbourhood that caters to the elderly as I observe one after another drive into this strip mall.  I asked for the Cod & Chips and she asked the cook to prepare the order as he came out from the kitchen inside towards the front DEEP Fryers to begin the meal.  I guess HEARING my food being deep-fried is part of the experience as the bubbling noise continues.  The cook dished up my meal and went back to the kitchen were I saw him take LARGE pieces of Fish and portion them using a scale.  He put a SQUEEZE bottle of Tartar Sauce with me too and it was same quality as other places.  I don't have much to comment on the Fries as they came as crispy as they should be anywhere else.  The COD portion was fine the way it is knowing nowadays the food cost is not getting any cheaper and the whole meal was enough to feed a regular Adult.  The BATTER was light & crispy even Heston Blumenthal would give it a pass rating.  Looking at the batter it is evident that the Cooking Oil was still FRESH while I use my fork to hit against the crispy batter to LISTEN to the crispiness that Heston did during his Fish & Chip episode.    The batter wasn't as THICK as others so when you bite into it, it's an initial CRUNCH and no subsequent crunch once it goes within your mouth.    The negative point is the Cod itself was a TINY bit undercooked JUST in the mid-portion and I could taste the thaw-liquid when I bite into it.  The Fish was also a bit CHEWY in the middle due this this fact, rather than how Fish usually flakes apart.  However if it was OVERCOOKED, it would be more of a crime in my opinion.  Let's summarize...  Chips - A-OK Tartar Sauce - A-OK Batter - I'm a FAN Fish - Needs MINOR Tune-up  *2.5* STARS for now!"}
{"text":"Best in the area I have had so far. The halibut literally tasted like a chicken nugget. So. Fucking. Good. I'll come back when my wallet isn't so light haha !"}
{"text":"I was looking for a fish & chips restaurant in Markham. I came onto Yelp & a couple of other food review websites and they all gave Danny's great reviews. I had to try it out for myself. They certainly did not disappoint and lived up to all of the great reviews! Love their halibut & fries and haddock & fries. My kids love it because they can have chicken tenders & fries when we order fish. Not greasy, fish is perfectly battered. LOVE their fries and coleslaw too. It is our go to place in Markham for fish & chips after trying out several places across Highway 7."}
{"text":"Absolutely delectable!! The comfortable, laid-back atmosphere paired with the excellent service makes this fish and chips restaurant a new favorite!  The food is undeniably scrumptious as the fish is fresh, the batter is light with the perfect crisp and the chips are fresh cut and perfectly fried. I tried the spicy batter my second time around and was delighted, the spicy flavour was well balanced and not overpowering, plus it still had the same perfect crunch!   Super yummy food and a staff that makes you feel like you are at home. I will definitely be back regularly."}
{"text":"I had no idea that there is a decent Fish & Chips place in Markham!  We been to the Olde Yorke and really loved the Fish & Chips there, but it's too far for us to go often. There is a Halibut House on Highway 7 but that place is nothing compare to Olde York.  I am so glad we found a Fish & Chips place which is somewhat comparable to Olde York and MUCH closer to home!  This place is family run and the owner is super nice. They have daily specials which is pretty amazing deal when you have a Jumbo Haddock and Chips for $9.99.  I went with that deal but upgraded my Chips to Poutine. The Jumbo Haddock had very good portion and I was surprised how big the poutine was also.  Taste wise, I always preferred Haddock over Halibut because Haddock's meat is not as dense and rough and the Haddock was fried to perfection.  Fries was very great as well with lots of tasty Gravy (more gravy the better) and cheese!  In terms of the decor, it looks kind of old inside, but the bench and seats may had been replaced recently, because I don't find them beat up at all!  Will for sure come back often for Fish & Chips!!  Price is also reasonable for a decent Fish & Chips place."}
{"text":"I went on Friday the 11th of September 2015. I ordered halibut & chips. My girlfriend ordered Halibut and Garden salad. The noise of the oil when the fries were placed in was so loud i knew i was in trouble. So the fries were raw....no surprise the fish was average at best. The batter was lacklustre and the oil wasnt fresh, even though it was Friday. My girlfriend's garden salad wasnt even close to fresh. 39$ later.....i would never go back. The only reason i went was because my real fish n chip joint had a car drive into it....CAPTAIN GEORGE STOUFFVILLE."}
{"text":"Haddock was nice and crisp, a bit greasy but not bad. Price also good. Chips and onion rings were quite bland. Would go there again"}
{"text":"Pretty expensive when compared to another fish and chips place I've been to. It's not bad though. The halibut is also smaller than the other place I've been to. The spicy option for the halibut was also pretty unique."}
{"text":"Really didn't have much to talk about.... The fish and chips was fair.   The seats weren't that comfortable. At least not mine.  The attitude of the old dude, which I think is the owner, really wasn't that good.....  The one thing that I remembered the most was that..... After i paid using my credit card.... Not only did he not say thank you, but he also threw the receipt at me.....  I was shocked.   So,.... I won't go again..."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite fish and chip places. Definitely the best in the area! Been going here since I was a kid, and though it's changed owners a couple of times, I recently went back for a visit with the fam and it did not disappoint. Just as good as I remember it! Love the halibut and chips especially, nice and crisp but not too much batter. Just right!"}
{"text":"I go to Danny's once every 2-3 months. Lets start with the fish - batter is thin and fish is a tad undercooked for my liking. Chips - yummy, i get my order to go and they load it up with fries. overall this place is kinda expensive but best fish & chips place in markham i have been to so far."}
{"text":"Small little diner style restaurant. Lots of parking.   I always go for the halibut and chips. Exactly how I like it. Nice light, crispy batter. Good chips. It's the best that I have had in the area."}
{"text":"I came to Danny's Fish & Chips once last year, because someone told me they had the best F&C in Markham.  It was not as good as I had hoped.  The fish was too, too thin for my liking.  The batter was crispy but very, very oily.  This might be because they didn't use newspaper to absorb the oil.    This is not a total loss because Markham has so few F&C places.  However, I have not returned since."}
{"text":"Excellent Halibut and chips at a reasonable price....with coleslaw $13.99, $12.99 without.  Coleslaw was way too vinegary..but still edible. Fish was moist and a decent size. Chips were standard fare, homemade, thick and good. Service was super fast..we ordered and our food was out in about 5 minutes. I would definitely go back if in the area."}
{"text":"We went here for my mother's birthday a couple months ago. I think after going to Mermaid Fish and Grill House at Lawrence/Vic Park my expectations were a little higher so I was quite disappointed.  This store is located on Highway 7 just east of Kennedy in the Dollarama plaza. Minimal seating inside and not very comfortable (maybe more so in the booth seats but I believe those were taken). Prices are pretty standard I think for fish and chips - the price depends on the fish you get and some are cheaper than others.   Service was friendly though not stellar as even though the waiter double checked with us, we still got the wrong fish. About the food - even though the fryer is right there, somehow the food wasn't even hot. Warm maybe. The fries were also not fresh - they were a bit burnt and dry and starchy and quite unappetizing and I did not want to eat them as they were very oily too. The fish was quite lackluster in taste but a good texture.    Definitely a more simple, family-style restaurant though not a very cozy or inviting one. Not very wallet-friendly though, especially for the quality you get."}
{"text":"I've driven past Danny's unassuming storefront for the last little while and only recently came in for a visit.   As per my usual habits - this was a take out lunch. The guy at the counter always seems very friendly and patient and it counts for a bit. Makes the experience very pleasant and you don't have to wait very long to get their attention when trying to order.  The price point for me it is on the the pricier side for what I normally want to spend for lunch; but    it is worth a splurge every now & then.  Foodwise: now I am not much of a fish person (call it due to a childhood trauma); so I usually order the shrimp and chips. The shrimp is nicely batter, kind of like a chinese fry style batter versus a tempura batter;  so it's thick, but not too thick with a pretty decent seasoning on it. The shrimp, themselves, are of a good size and you get about 6 of them plus the chips.  The chips are pretty good, not the best I've had - but they are ok. Their onion rings are decent as well, although not quite a plentiful as the fries.  They also have clam chowder soup which is ok, but a touch on the runny side; but the flavor is there.  Overall, pretty good, but doesn't blow my mind, but a good place to satisfy my deep friend stuff craving, while I am at work."}
{"text":"At Danny, the seating is pretty beat up. The seat at the my table was damaged, for the entire dinner I only sit with one side of my butt....and one side of my butt was sore after the meal.  The food: i tried both haddock and halibut. Unfortunately, the batter for both fishes are not crispy enough (at least i tried better ones).  The batter is slightly seasoned.   As for the fish itself, the haddock is moist, and the halibut has retained the firm texture. Therefore I give them a star for it.  Chips: a good fish and chips restaurant must be able to master both the fried fish and fries. I am not sure why, although the chips is fresh from the fryer, is not crisp at all...(trust me I can make better chips with my toaster oven at home).  It's my first time here as the owner of Mr Fish and Chips on the other side of Kennedy Road has decided to retire and closed down. It's a disappointed first time experience.  I have been searching for a good fish and chips restaurant for few weeks now.... So far, the other one I tried in Mississauga - Jag's Fish N Chips is the best one (in both value and quality) within the GTA."}
{"text":"My wife and daughter joined me for lunch to satisfy a craving I had for traditional fish & chips, and we were not disappointed.  We had their specialty items, halibut, cod, shrimp, scallops and chips, with a side of mushy peas and coleslaw. All delicious! Most impressive also was their spotless kitchen equipment. Stainless fryers like new, (non-toxic vinegar the secret to their cleanliness). Finishing with a delicious old fashioned chocolate milkshake, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh Danny. I am disappointed! We chose to come here for a quick dinner based on all of the positive reviews. Upon entering, the staff greeted us quickly even though they were busy with their own tasks. As to be expected of a fish and chips shop, the air was filled with a distinct fishy oily scent.   The fish part of the fish and chips was not at all what we expected. The batter was thick but not very crispy or flavorful. The fish itself was mushy and very bland. The fries were pretty bad as well, they didn't seem fresh and were fairly oily. It seemed like the oil wasn't hot enough when they started frying.  The price point felt steep for the quality that you get. The portion sizing is fair but we were really disappointed with the quality of the food.  Hopefully, this was just an off day but I am not inclined to come back and try again. Service was lovely though!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in town! Nice and crispy, consistent. Nothing much to ask for."}
{"text":"I would say 3 stars rounding down to 2 stars.  Reasoning is the price.  Paid $17+ for a fish and chips lunch with a can of Diet Coke. So including tip was $19 and change.  Fish and Chips came with 1 piece of fish and a generous serving fries.  Although it was halibut I ordered.. don't think it's worth the $20 for lunch. The fries were not fresh cut, deep fried from a bag of frozen potatoes.  The batter on the fish was not bad... it wasn't thick.. but I wouldn't give the batter 3 stars.. didn't really help the fish flavour or have enough flavour on its own... basically apart from not being over coated in batter, the fish and chips was nothing special.  Overall, I would value the meal at about $12 plus tip.. instead of the $17.25 plus tip."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips place in town or should I say City now that Markham is a city. The fish and chips place is unique and great because the fish is actually procured at the proper places. The halibut is procured in alaska making it now more expensive than normal due to currency exchange rates.  But the quality is assured. The haddock is a cheaper option but as a jumbo only costs slightly more, the whole establishment is very cost friendly. The fries here are better than mcdonalds due to it having a larger width.  What else can I say about fish and chips here eh!"}
{"text":"First time coming here! The service was pretty good, the server was very polite and always made sure everything was okay, but probably because there weren't that many people there when we were there.  The food was pretty good. The batter was thick and crunchy, you can taste the distinct flavours and the texture of different fish. Fries were not bad either. I thought the tartar sauce taste a bit odd, because I think it's homemade and not enough relish in it, because it almost taste like too much mayo. Besides that the actual fish and chips was good. I haven't had the mashed green peas before and I enjoyed that a lot too. It feels like mashed potatoes except not as finely mashed and a different but similar taste.  Would definitely come back and try some other things on their menu because they have a large variety of fish with or without chips."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars.  I would like to think that I am a pretty humble person. I am not exactly described as snobby. If I do come across as being a stuck-up fish and chips person, I apologize in advance. I am really not!  I grew up in the Beaches area of Toronto. I have fond memories of having fish and chips. My favourite store was one that I ended up working at one summer. I loved the chips that you could get in a small brown bag, wrapped in a newspaper pouch. I learned how to wrap fish and chips British-style. This place served both halibut and cod. I always loved the halibut and it has not changed since.  Recently, the fish and chips store that I frequented often in Markham, which reminded me of the food at the fish and chip store in my old neighbourhood (it closed down decades ago) was on Highway 7, just west of Kennedy Road. The owner decided to sell his store. It is now a cafe.  So, I am on a mission to find a decent fish and chips store in my neighbourhood. Danny's is filling the void fairly nicely.  The other night, I ordered the halibut and onion rings as takeout. I am tired of fries these days, mainly because everything seems to have fries and I get bored. So, I went with onion rings.  My halibut was nicely battered and was perfectly done. You taste the sweetness of the halibut. The batter was never overpowering. It was a decent piece of fresh fish.  The onion rings were good, too. I normally don't eat them, but I enjoy them now and again. They weren't so crispy that I could cut a circle out of my window and break out of my home. They weren't soggy, either. I liked them.  I will come back and give some more items a go. So far, so good.  (97)"}
{"text":"The service was fast.  The white fish was fresh and crispy. Delicious and inexpensive.  I would highly recommend this place for any fish and chips lover."}
{"text":"Tried every type of fish they had. White fish, haddock, halibut, and cod.  This is the best fish n chips I've had in Markham. So good we came here every weekend for 2 months straight. White fish & haddock was the best. Portion could be bigger - there just wasn't enough fish to fill up my stomach.  Definitely try their soup of the day. I've had 3 different soups so far and they all impressed. Friendly staff and price is right. I wouldn't order the coleslaw if I were you..unless you like super sour coleslaws.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Decided to try the tilapia and chips they had on special. you get 2 strips of tilapia as oppose to the big filet of halibut.  service was just as good as usual however they forgot to give me tartar sauce this time for my takeout. mistakes happen we all make them, not a big deal but would've loved some.  If you're willing to pay more, i'd go with the halibut."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the coupon I found on a Chinese website, I wouldn't have know there's a fish & chips place on Hwy 7/ Kennedy. The restaurant decor to be old style diner, with tiny booth couches. Services were great as server/ cook was helpful. We ordered HADDOCK, COD and POLLOCK w/ chips and coleslaw.  FOOD: - pollock and cod had more \"fish\" taste - all fishies were crunchy, not as thick of a batter as it looked - coleslaw was a bit sweeter as its homemade - well portioned  OVERALL: - pretty good fish & chips - able to enjoy different kinds of fishies  Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great small fish and chip place hidden on a strip plaza on highway 7. I have driven by this plaza many times and never stopped by until we read the reviews. And we were delighted by the same results.  We ordered: halibut+chips+coleslaw and haddock+chips with side order of mushy peas.  As others have mentioned, the fish is battered and coated as you order it and then cooked immediately. Fish was cooked will and batter was light and crispy - quite good compared to other thick layers of batter. Fries were the good as well. This was a bit of surprise but we were a bit fan of the coleslaw - crunchy, tangy and flavoured well. The only downside is the the benches are a bit old and springy but the food definitely makes up for it.  Great place and we will return."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. A staple in Markham for great fish and chips! The fish is always fresh and the French fries are done just right!"}
