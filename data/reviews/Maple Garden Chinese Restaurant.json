{"text":"BEWARE ordering from this restaurant! When we placed our order over the phone we said that we would pay by credit card at the door when the driver arrived. He forgot to bring the machine, so he started freaking out on my husband and yelling \"cash only!\" My husband offered to drive to the closest ATM and get cash for him but then the driver said he didn't have time to wait that he had more work to do. He started swearing and yelling and took the food and drove off. This was by far the scariest experience and I would not recommend this place to anyone. I don't want people like that knowing where I live or coming near my home."}
{"text":"I order different things at different times and its always been amazing ! The have great specials, and everythings always fresh.  They make the wings and chicken balls the way I like them as well, its been hard to find a place in Vaughan that can !  Great for dine in or take-out, I usually get take out."}
{"text":"Placed a large delivery for a party. Portions nice size price is cheap. Food was great was eating it for a few day after. Would order again"}
{"text":"Fast delivery, super friendly staff.  Been eating from these guys for years and years.  Good always fresh pay a decent buck for good Chinese food.  They deserve 5 stars"}
{"text":"i'm sorry but i just had it and its horrible.. general tso is not good food is extra extra salty and saucy to the point you can only have one piece. not recommended. \"maple garden delight\" = hell! wtf?? horrible ribs"}
{"text":"Living in Maple for almost a decade now, friends and I have frequented Maple Garden whenever we had cravings for quick, no hassle Chinese food. Having been a regular for so long, I have noted that the quality of this restaurant has fluctuated over the last few years. Not a great place to sit down and eat, a cramped an out dated seating supports this notion. Take out or delivery all the way. Try to pay cash, as you will receive a discount for this.  Overall the food has gone from better than average to just decent. The General Tso's Chicken is still tasty, but the quality of chicken used is not one that is exciting. Food is a little greasy, yet it always hits the spot when quality is not of the utmost concern. Also, the chicken balls (although heavily breaded) are rather tasty.  The service here is great, deliveries are generally smooth and efficient, and they are always friendly in my dealings. Overall average experience - nothing special, but not too much to complain about."}
{"text":"Pretty good take out.  Was fresh and reasonably priced.   The inside of the place is pretty basic with a few tables for eat in.   I used to order from this place years ago then stopped because of a few issues.  The old owner/manager was rude and that was one of the reasons I stopped going, It must be under new management now ? I read a few reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try again since it's been years. The guys there today were young and very nice and  accommodating to sauce on the side.  I will try this place again for take out for sure."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 stars. It is what it is. I love that they don't use MSG. The honey garlic ribs and chicken wings are done well and the mixed vegetables are crisp and fresh. Water was refilled often and the decor/space is nice and quiet. Well done!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese Restaurants in the Vaughan area.  Killer Spring Rolls!  Great General Tso's Chicken  Excellent other Chinese plates.  Take out is where it is at with Maple Garden.    Remember....the Spring Rolls are the best in town so try them out."}
{"text":"I have been looking.. nay... searching for an old-school, North-American-style Chinese Food joint that delivers to my house in Vaughan, and have been met with nothing but disappointment, time after time again.  Rejoice waistline! Or rather, weep. For I have finally found what I've been looking for.  Maple Garden Chinese has it all:  1)The menu has everything I like on it 2)The proteins are cooked perfectly and are really high quality 3)The food is not overly greasy and disgusting 4)They know how to cook everything on the menu properly, so you can feel safe if you go outside the usual orders once in a while 5)They deliver in a large area and food arrives fast and PIPING hot  it's not rocket science. I'm seriously such a cheap date when it comes to this kind of food, but most of the places around here are just not good.  I'm taking one star off because I don't give 5 stars out to a place unless I've tried it more than a few times, but I'm confident with my next order this one will get bumped up. I hope."}
{"text":"foos ia good. price is good. The house special rice wasnt the greateat.. tasted a bit burnt.. than i ordered the shrimp fried rice a week aftee..and it tasted better.. so i dunno..if maybe they just gave me bad rice the first time i ordered. but the food was good after that."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on a Saturday night.  First off, you better check Google maps before picking up if you don't know where it is, it can be hard to find. When I went in to get the food, there wasn't a sole in this place except for the owner (atleast I'm assuming he's the owner). That's usually not a good sign. However, the food was excellent!! Just what we were looking for, North American style chine food! Reminds me of what we used to get in Montreal. Price is very reasonable, and we got 10% off at the counter for paying with cash. When I'm craving Chinese food, this will be my go to."}
{"text":"this restaurant is authentic and service is first class.  Plenty of parking in the back.    Buffet during the week is cheap price. not a big buffet, just the fundamental items:3soups, egg rolls spring rolls, rice, chicken balls, mixed vegetables, and spare ribs, plus+    The waiter never lets your water glass go empty.       Deserts lack, orange slices or cookies.  For a lunch at $8.00 can't go wrong."}
