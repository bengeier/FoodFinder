{"text":"Another great addition to the brewery and dining scene in Charlotte: Hyde Brewing/Suffolk Punch brings finer dining to the brewery scene. Refined, creative dishes are artfully presented and skillfully prepared. Locally sourced, seasonal ingredients. From the tasty burger on an English muffin to North Carolina red snapper, all our dishes were very good! A huge selection of draft beers--Hyde's and other local beers--to please anyone's palate. Also craft coffee with its special focus on the water chemistry! Pastries coming soon too--will have to return very soon to check out the coffee and pastries. Decor is industrial/rustic with coziness thrown in via hanging plants and planters embedded in the tables. High top veranda dining along one side, beer garden bench tables with a more limited menu at the back, with the Lynx line quietly swishing by from time to time. Outside bar as well. Worth a visit, especially on these beautiful evenings!"}
{"text":"Service was awful at the bar. We wanted to order dinner, but by the time we had got our drinks (just one round) and a small app, we where looking at 50 minutes. After 20 minutes of being done with the apps and drink a bartender comes up and asks \"you good\".. got the check ($30 for 2 drinks and an app.. cmon guys you're not that good) and left. Didn't even have a single one of your own beers on draft. I understand this is a soft opening, but cmon.."}
{"text":"Excellent and incredibly diverse revolving beer list. Have tried a good chunk of menu items on two visits and really enjoyed the lamb tartar, the ceviche and the burger. Will also echo many other sentiments on the space - very, very well done."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on opening night and while the service was not perfect it was much better than I would expect for their first night. The interior is amazing, plants everywhere and overall great vibe. Our food was good but not great. It was beautifully presented but both the heirloom tomato salad and the farmed cucumbers while good seemed to lack a little something that would make them great. We will definitely try them again."}
{"text":"This coffee bar - brewery - restaurant is destined to be my new favorite spot. Walkable, 48 beers on tap and more to come, the food is artfully prepared and the patio is refreshing with its sailcloth sunshades, AstroTurf grass and herbs growing from the middle of the wooden farmhouse picnic tables. Open from dawn till late night, you can stop in and grab your morning coffee, provided by Lindsey Pittman and Hyde Coffee. Return for an after work beer and dinner or small plates.   Must try: Suffolk Punch Burger. Seriously.   I had the steak (delish) and tasted the chicken (also amazing), but the burger was by far the best thing we tried all night. The pickled garnish on top made it. The fries that come with the burger are also to die for. They are salty enough to keep you wanting just one more."}
{"text":"I had an amazing time with my parents, my best friend and boy. we ordered the  ROASTED SUMMER SQUASH and the grilled bacon as starters and it was great!!! My mom and I shared the mussels and steak and it was all perfectly cooked and tasted even better. We all loved the interior decor. It does get a little crowed as the night goes on but other then that it is a great place to sit and have a meal with family and friends . RJ the chef is an amazing cook!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Charlotte. This is the only brewery in Charlotte where you can get whatever you want. You can get a liquor drink, beer or even coffee. Not one brewery in Charlotte has all of these choices. I think that the decor is so creative and the outdoor area is so cool. I had the burger and those amazing peppers. The peppers are like addicting. Go give this place a try I'm sure you'll go back more than once!"}
{"text":"Came the other night for drinks after work. Loved this place. I shared small plates with a friend and all the food was amazing. Trust me...get the peppers. Our bartender was Dexter. He was awesome and knew exactly which cocktails to recommend. The outside seating area is large, great for happy hours. I will definitely be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & service.  Small plates (fried pickles and grilled peppers) were very good.  The Suffolk Burger was mediocre... (why I have them a 4 instead of 5) Overall, we enjoyed and will be back..."}
{"text":"The Place looks fantastic inside and out I'll give that 5 stars!!! Most of the people are great that work there, I went there for a few times now and I just moved around the corner. One of the bartender I met I think his name is Mike is an arrogant asshole sorry for my language, he is very disrespectful to everybody that comes up to his bar when he is working and starts acting like a childish kid when he get busy, slamming glasses and ignoring people he doesn't like... He made my last two experiences there awful and I might not come back. Another thing they might need to fix is the chef with all of the hoops in his ear probably needs to learn how to be somewhat quiet and respect his staff some more. He was a little scary and seemed disrespectful. Hope some of the staff gets fixed so I actually might enjoy myself when I come back."}
{"text":"Thought it might have been an off day for the service but judging by the reviews it seems like it's a common theme... the Hyde beer was good but the service was not pleasant.  When we went up to the outside bar the bartenders barely acknowledged and didn't seem to interested or enthused to help. The atmosphere is great, the food was decent and overall this place has potential.  I also think the Suffolk Punch/Hyde branding is a little confusing, wish they would just combine them into 1 but maybe that's just me. Will come back again because of the great location and atmosphere, hopefully will be able to update the review if the service is better!"}
{"text":"The Suffolk Punch had some great choices that aren't common in restaurants. The drinks are strong and reasonably priced. I'd go back to sit on the patio and to try something new!"}
{"text":"Suffolk Punch is using deceptive wait-list management. They have signed up with the NoWait app service which is used by good handful restaurants in Charlotte to manage wait-lists. It showed \"no-wait\".  But, Suffolk Punch is not updating their queue in it, so that it looks like they are always able to handle traffic and customers without wait. However, when you arrive at the restaurant, the nonchalant answer is, \"Oh yeah, we know about that, but it is 1.5 hours wait.\" And, then, blame the \"algorithm\" for their mistake of proper management and usage of the list.  This drives additional traffic to their restaurant without any hope of serving them. This is very deceptive. No idea how their food is, however, I will not return to any restaurant that tries to trick me into visiting."}
{"text":"A brewery, coffee shop, and restaurant combined in one.....winning! Bonus, it is off of the Rail Trail!  My husband and I stopped in on Valentine's Day to check this place out for the first time. I immediately fell in love with the vibe inside. All the plants just gave it a great atmosphere feel. I also loved the patio area.   We grabbed a seat at the bar. My hubby ordered one of the Hyde Brewing beers and I got a mixed drink (don't remember the name but it had whisky, raspberry puree, and club soda). Both drinks were good. The beer list was fairly extensive and included beers from other local breweries. We ordered the Wagyu beef with dipping sauce as an appetizer. Absolutely delish. I loved the dipping sauce and the meat was so flavorful!  Service was so good! We even got candy for Valentine's day! Absolutely will return!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal with my parents (who are extremely hard to please)!  The atmosphere is fabulous, we sat outside, which will be perfect this fall with the heat lamps and outdoor TV's. They really did a top notch job with the interior decor and patio space.    We ordered a little bit of everything to try the Menu. Everything was really fresh, quality and served piping hot. Service was also very good.   Probably one of the best experiences in Charlotte for a casual dinner, especially in Southend, which was much needed!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and excellent waiter, unprofessional manager who tried to discourage our waiter from checking we were ok"}
{"text":"The hand crafted cocktails are on point  Mike knows what he's doing. Definitely one of my top places to go in charlotte. Seasonal menu as well so you can mix it up."}
{"text":"I'm giving this places solid 4 stars because I love the vibe, coffee, beer selection and most of the food options!  It's definitely a millennial dream come true and hipster vibe. If that's you, give it a try! It has a brewery/Coffee/food vibe. Which is chill, relaxing and comforting.    During the day you can bring your laptop and get work done while enjoy a sip of delicious well crafted coffee, and even grab a beer if that's your style with a great menu to choose from.   From the menu I definitely recommend the veggie burger! Very delicious.  The reason I'm not giving it a 5 and taking away a star is because one time I came with a bunch of friends and we ordered a dessert, which had nuts in it (not listed on the menu). My friend took a bit and has a slight allergy to peanuts (slight meaning tickling/stinging sensation in the throat but not anaphylactic). When we stated that to the waiter, he was angry that she took the bit because he could have reused that dessert for someone else! Wait what? Someone else? Then proceed to tell us they only have a limited number of desserts because they are frozen.   It made me really sad that this event occurred because I had high hopes for this place.   I still enjoy the vibe and drinks. But definitely won't be getting any dessert anytime soon, and be double checking if there are nuts in anything, especially if you have an allergy!"}
{"text":"I'm just frustrated with this place.. maybes it's me.. maybe it's them.. but I can not for the life of me figure out when they serve food, or all their weird hours. I know they had a lot of changes and updates as they opened and got up and running but I am just missing the ball on their hours, food times, bar menu vs lunch vs brunch vs dinner.  Not to mention when I come in and ask for a menu, they RUDELY tell me the kitchen closed at 9pm. He acts like it's printed on his forehead and he's upset that I even asked."}
{"text":"Great location, atmosphere and beer. Bar staff outside were super friendly, but my husband and I weren't greeted or acknowledged by staff inside. A simple hello or be right with you goes a long way."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch!! Also, in the heated/tented outdoor area you can bring your dog. It's awesome! Delicious food and great drinks. A solid new addition to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Had a great Easter brunch. Food, drinks and service were great!!!  Super tasty menu and drinks were unique and yummy!  We dined inside and then moved outside. Really cool atmosphere and perfect sunny day. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Excellent service,  ambiance, and food! We came here on a whim for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. It was myself,my mother, sister, and my 11 month old daughter. We sat outside as the weather was perfect. I love that you can seat yourself, order your food (and drinks) at the bar, and then they bring everything to you. The vibe is very laid back! There are high chairs for babies which I loved. The outdoor seating is also pet friendly. I noticed they even put out bowls of water for dogs which I thought was sweet.  The bartender made EXCELLENT drinks. I left having 2 drinks and felt NICE (lol) after leaving. We ordered a carafe of mimosa and then I had a cucumber mule which was AWESOME! For breakfast we had shrimp and grits, and also the suffolk breakfast  (eggs, bacon, sausage, and grits (my mom got hers with potatoes).  We received our food quickly and the servers were kind.  I loved that my daughter could people watch and walk around the outdoor area freely without feeling like we were bothering anyone or in the way. She loved looking at the dogs and walking around the picnic tables.    After brunch we walked alongside the light rail strip for a bit and then headed back to our car.  It was a great afternoon. We will definitely be back as I want to see what Hyde Brewery has to offer!"}
{"text":"This is the best brunch I have had in a long time. I got the shrimp and grits and it was amazing. It had some spice to it so prepare yourself. But it was great. The drink menu also has a lot of great options. If you are in the area this place is a must visit!!"}
{"text":"Can't even be bothered to update website that they are closed for a private event.... several disgruntled customers all of which double checked hours on website prior to coming... not cool in an arena of new restaurants popping up all the time...clearly service remains an issue for them... save your money and go to a place that will appreciate you and your time.A lack of service mentality will eventually bring down even the most delicious /trendy restaurants. Based on reviews on yelp, word of mouth reviews from peers and my personal experience a service mentality is not a priority."}
{"text":"I ate at Suffolk Punch on Saturday, March 3 for brunch with a girlfriend!  WOW!  I was torn between at least three menu items, and then had to stop our waitress and ask about the delicious looking items that were passing by us on their way to other patrons... Deciding FINALLY on the Shrimp and Grits was an arduous task, but SO worth it... I ate EVERY last BITE!  I also treated myself to their Apple Cider Old Fashioned which was simply lovely...   The service, the drinks, the FOOD, the beautiful atmosphere, and the sheer size of this place... everything appealed to me... I will be going back again!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a one star for ambience and perhaps one and a half for food. We went there for Sunday brunch and the place was packed. Hostess said it would be about a 30 minute wait. We went to the bar which was standing room only. Female bartender that came over to us was very rude. We were seated in about 25 minutes in a booth. I ordered the French toast and unfortunately the pecan crust on it was burnt so it ruined the taste of the entire dish. My husband got a breakfast sandwich and stated it was delicious.  He ordered a second beer which our server forgot. All in all I more than likely would not return."}
{"text":"I had such a wonderful expedience here today! Our wait staff was polite, personable and very helpful. I snagged their yummy grilled chicken sandwich which had queso, pickled onions and two grilled chicken breasts. To say it was yummy would be an understatement! It was delicious! I will be back for sure! The outdoor seating was delightful, I loved that they had awnings over the tables that ACTUALLY blocked the sun effectively. The inside of this adorable restaurant, bar, coffeehouse hybrid had modern, quaint AND hipster vibes which made for awesome decor. I had a great time and will totally be back!   Food 10/10 Atmosphere 10/10 Staff 10/10 Decor 10/10!"}
{"text":"I came here the other night as I had been hearing really good things about Suffolk. To start, the decor and ambiance is incredible. Its very open and a great place to hang. The outdoor patio is even more incredible and has plenty of room so it never really feels crowded. I started with one of their beers think it was the Donington - one of Hyde's own brews. Really enjoyed it. Then I checked out their cocktail list - even MORE killer! I had come to try the beers but ended up falling in love with the inventive craft cocktails they had. I would recommend the Lime in the Coconut or the Hyde Daisy. Whether you are a cocktailer or a beer drinker - you cant go wrong with the beverages here. We also got a few bites to eat - peppers, potato croquettes and the smoked heirloom tomatoes. All of which were stellar. Lastly, but what I consider to be most important was the service. Regardless of how good the drinks, ambiance or food is, if the service sucks, it can ruin a place. However, Hyde/Suffolk comes out on top in this department. When I first arrived, the bartender working - (Mike? i think was his name?) helped me find a beer he thought I would like and then introduced me to that tantalizing cocktail menu! Not only was he helpful and kind but he was very attentive even with the busy night he had been having - he's also easy on the eyes ;) I also met another bartender who said she had recently started with Suffolk but has worked in the industry for quite some time - just by watching her work and seeing her interacting with customers and the bar staff, you can tell that she knows what shes doing. She was very professional and on top of her game. Also was another incredibly nice person (Rachel? or Reagan?). Both of them were a class act & really worked hard to make sure everyone and everything was taken care of. No question, I will be back and am adding Hyde/Suffolk to my regular spot rotation :) Looking forward to enjoying many more nights here! Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"We checked in with the No Wait App and the wait was much shorter than estimated; always a positive! We started with the pimento cheese and bacon jam and it was delicious! My husband got the Suffolk Punch burger I think it was called and it came out perfectly cooked and tasty. I got the BLT which was good, nothing too crazy and out of the ordinary. We also enjoyed a few of their beers. They had 19 Hyde beers on tap which is way more than the 4 they had last time. Overall, definitely enjoyed it and will be back!"}
{"text":"I went here on the second weekend it was open. I was just there for drinks, but I didn't notice any growing pains. The atmosphere here is amazing!! The inside is decorated so well and it has a beautiful outside area. They have a good selection of unique beers, but prices are slightly above the average beer in the area. I'm excited to taste some of their own beers once they are released."}
{"text":"Meh, overpriced and average. Really neat vibe, multiple breweries featured, nice outdoor area. Waited over 2 hours to be seated--followed by a 20 minute wait to be greeted by a server."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and the food was pretty good when they opened, but with over-priced drinks, no parking and now what seemed to be mediocre food, I don't know that I'll be back.  I should have put in my 4+ star review when I first went in early August, but I guess I never got around to it.  I like the Hyde beers, so, I'm hoping other places start to carry them as well.  There is a lack of good food at our breweries in NC, I assume due to some weird ABC law.  Upon my first visit, I thought all that had changed.  2nd visit with just went with some burgers and pickles.  They weren't bad really, but no clue why they are charging so much.  I don't know.  Maybe it was just an off night.  I wish I could tell you more, but it just doesn't seem to live up the hype."}
{"text":"Great ambience, innovative menu, and coffee cocktail is a  refreshing scenery.  We stumbled upon its first days serving brunch menu, and it does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's such a cool concept! A culinary cafe serving up all your favs...you want coffee, beer and brunch? They have it all.   We sat at the bar and all of the bartenders were so helpful and informative. I ordered a mango habanero margarita and it was soooo good. If you don't try anything else here and like it a little spicy...this is the drink for you!   I also shared the chicken and egg biscuit with sausage crazy. It was very tasty as well. I loved how well everything blended together. I'd absolutely order it again, but there are so many delicious options on the menu that I'm looking forward to trying everything!   I'm looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This place has a great setup inside and makes it have a very homie feel to it with all the decor and lights.   I love the location of this place because it's literally a sneeze away from the light rails New Bern exit.  I met with a couple of friends to grab some food and some drinks. It was National Burger day so they had $9 specials for a burger and fries. I feel like getting a burger/sandwich so I ended up going with the Wagyu sandwich.  The Wagyu had shaved beef with some flash fried onion rings and a horseradish sauce which was deluctant.  For beer I sat around with my friend just tasting what beer made sense with our food choices. I went for one of the coffee stouts, not sure the name but the bartender will sure be happy to help and then went for Introduce the Juice, a New England IPA from Hyde brewing.  We ordered the drinks and food at the bar, took the drinks outside and then we had a number where the food would be delivered right to us, except my friend who ordered the nachos and got them at the bar immediately before we ever ordered our brews; talk about fast.  This was a great spot to hang out and unfortunately the coffee bar was closed, but hopefully next time I'll get to try some of their craft coffees."}
{"text":"From the artisanal coffee, to the creative cocktails, Suffolk Punch rocks my socks. It has super chill vibes during the day if you need to work on your laptop, and turns into a bustling night-time hot spot for after work drinks, or a fun night out. I would seek out Mike, who was extremely attentive and made a kick-ass Rosemary Mule!"}
{"text":"We have visited Suffolk Punch on a few occasions and I just think it is a-okay. I really think it hovers over 4 stars merely due to atmosphere but here is why it is a solid-3.  1. The outdoor area and indoor area is phenomenal. From the cozy booth seating to the warm communal tables, both exude true \"coolness.\" If you want to watch a game, great. If you want to have good conversation you're able to do so.  2.  Lots of great beer options if you're into that thing. But I can't drink it. And you only offer one, very mediocre, blanco tequila for me to drink. like, WOOF. You pride yourself on such quality beers AND a great menu, but ave a SOLID full bar, too. who is behind your cocktail menu? I opt for wine, which is also sub-par offerings. Just disappointing.  3. The food is inventive with amazing flavors. I really appreciate the gluten-friendly menu. I wish the cheese board was larger, and we'd be happy to pay more. For brunch, however, don't tell me that i can't get egg whites. If you have real eggs, you have egg whites. Any line-cook should be able to separate the yolk from the egg in about two seconds. The hash was AMAZING but I don't like egg yolks. J had the chicken and biscuit and it looked amazing. Bacon was great, too!  Haven't totally written this place off, but we don't always go out of our way to get here. Does get pretty packed on the weekends so arrive early and grab a spot."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place for food. We went last Friday evening for drinks, and were not super impressed with the service. There could have been some miscommunication about what we wanted, but at first we had a waiter who was going to take drink orders and then they never came back so we just went to the bar to order.   Anyway, this morning's brunch made up for it. First off, I LOVE the space. I love the plants hanging and along the bar. The fresh green mixed in with the wood and metal is really nice. I'm also a sucker for cool logos and incorporating the designs around the place, which Suffolk Punch/Hyde does really well. We got there at noon and had no wait getting a table. Two of us opted for the omelet and one got the French toast (which looked amazing). Omelet was also yummy! The side was fingerling potatoes, which are actually just French fries but they were pretty good as well. I got a side of bacon- DELICIOUS. I will say the coffee was $3 and then there was an additional charge for another cup. They brewed it fresh, but kind of expected a coffee refill to be free.   Otherwise, service was great and the food was also really good. We will definitely be back to try other stuff on the menu, including the cocktails!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and drinks. Ordered the beer cheese and pretzels, pretzels tasted like days old bread and the beer cheese was COLD. The server told me it was intended to be served like that?!!!?!!!! Who wants cold beer cheese? Ordered the wagyu sandwich for dinner and while it was very salty, it was pretty good (I love salt). Fries were great. I love the atmosphere and will definitely be back again but never ordering the beer cheese and pretzels again."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner snack on their first official day of business. I was immediately taken back by the decor and overall vibe of the place. Loved all the green plants and pristine bar. Plenty of beers on tap and not the same ol beers you see in every bar around Charlotte. We tried the fries, mushrooms, and potato croquettes. Fries were fine, but nothing special. Mushrooms were oily and not so great. But the croquettes were awesome! The hosts (3) seemed to have no clue what was going on and some of the staff seemed a bit unprepared. However it was their first night so I can't really hold it against them. I will definitely be back for some prime patio sitting and diving more into their menu."}
{"text":"This place is Suffolk-ing good. Lost one star because the beet salad needed more cheese/pistachios and the fried green tomatoes were a bit too firm. Also Tyler V was attentive and helpful, 5 stars for him!"}
{"text":"Had a business dinner here at it was a amazing!  Laid back environment with a modern decor. Great options on beer and wine!  The food was absolutely amazing!!  Had most of the appetizers and our favorites were fried pickles, shishito peppers, and pimento cheese with bacon jam. I had the short ribs and the portion was too big for me to finish. Highly highly recommend this place and def. will be back!!!"}
{"text":"First time shopper.....phenomenal burger!  While is past 12 did not indulge in the craft...on the clock. After hours for sure!!!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best spots in Charlotte. The indoor dining is classic farm to table with an amazing beer menu. The grass fed burger is delicious and the citrus vinaigrette dressing on the mixed greens - I want to bottle it.  The atmosphere is even better.  Sit outside to enjoy the sun with your puppies, stop in after a run and bike ride on the light rail trail, or just pop in for a casual weeknight dinner.  Our new favorite place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had to wait for my bag at CLT. Found my way here, great beer and awesome food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place opening up and knew it was across from CCC Brewing, but had not had a chance to experience it myself until my wife and I stopped in the other night. First off, the space is incredible. Very open, lots of natural wood, and a huge patio. From the front you would not have guessed the size of this place. In addition, I like the idea of combining a brewery, coffee bar, and restaurant all in one - and right off the rail trail!   Full disclaimer before we go further, I only had a few beers here and an appetizer - not a full dinner. That being said, I tried 2 of Hyde's beers (FYI Hyde brewing is part of the Suffolk Punch, that confused me for a while) and enjoyed both while my wife had a mixed drink. We also ordered a Wagyu beef appetizer with dipping sauce and found it to be excellent. I'll be excited to come back once the weather warms up a bit and sit on the patio to try more of their menu and beer selection."}
{"text":"First visit: Sunday brunch, nice vibe at 10.   Coffee:  drip coffee had a good roasted flavor. Not bitter for strong coffee.  chocolate cinnamon latte: good flavor, nice earthy taste, could be hotter tho.   Food: Suffolk Plate: definitely a good choice. Over medium eggs were done corectly. Old school sausage, real bacon.   Chicken and biscuit: great. Chef Eric would not do scrambled egg white.  Egg yolks make my stomach upset for some reason. I took one for the team. It was good, I recommend it.   Our server was very personable and genuinely interested in his customers.   Will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their beer list is extensive and their prices are great. You can have a meal of small plates or a full size meal to yourself. The atmosphere is my favorite part, it is a large open space that can accommodate the masses on any given day. I was in tonight for a quick dinner and everyone was watching baseball and football at the bar, celebrating a birthday on the patio, and having casual dinner with family and friends. The food was very tasty. They have a few fresh dishes, but overall definitely a heavier fall style menu right now. We had the deviled eggs, charcuterie board, sautéed mushrooms, and a fried goat cheese salad.  Follow me @jodieats_"}
{"text":"This place is new and awesome. The bacon app is a must have! After we ate we sat outside. Artificial grass outside and plants in the center of the tables gives the allure that are you aren't by a bunch of warehouses."}
{"text":"The place overall has gray decor and feel but the drinks are too expensive and the service has been rude or slow. I have been twice. The first time was the day after the soft opening and they were out of everything besides tea and coffee. I totally understood. But the only reason I knew this was because my friends who were already there told me. We were one of 3 groups there and when I walked in no one greeted me. I had no idea how the place worked. After waiting at our table for many minutes I walked up to the bar and tried ordering a tea. Long story the girl working was snotty and unhelpful. They also didn't have sugar for tea. The second time I went was a Saturday evening for drinks. After looking over the cocktail menu and seeing drinks ran about $13 or $10 for wines, my friend and I ordered well vodka sodas. They were fine. But upon receiving the bill they cost $28.50. Which would mean they were more expensive than the specialty cocktails. We asked the bartender and he shortly told us this is how it works there and all drinks are $13. So a house vodka with club soda costs the same as a gin special with a lemon twist, charred something or other, and some fancy flavor. I have never been to a place where the house wells are the same prices as specialty drinks and more expensive than nice wines. The bartender also seemed more busy with friends than with speaking to us. I voted a 3 because I have yet to try their food and love the inside"}
{"text":"Went last night, around 7.15. It was very lively, but we were able to get a very comfortable booth and the noise level wasn't so loud that we had to raise our voices to have a conversation. I'm finding this is becoming a problem in many establishments (or it's because I'm getting more life experience, aka older ;) )  Our server was very friendly and helpful in walking us through the menu and making some suggestions. We had 2 different beers both brewed by Hyde, I wish I remembered the names, both were delicious.   We shared the tuna, fried green tomatoes, and deviled eggs from the small plates, and the pickled grape salad, added shrimp. Everything we ate was outstanding!   Despite being a converted warehouse with industrial decor, the place felt warm and welcoming, probably thanks to the plants hanging from baskets throughout the restaurant and the warm colors used on leather booths. Kudos to the designer(s)."}
{"text":"The food here was a great tapas style experience - really nice for sharing with a couple friends (which is what we did). We had the crab croquettes (great), pork belly (okay), wagyu sandwich (delicious), toasted quinoa salad (amazing sun dried tomato dressing), pretzel sticks with beer cheese (wow!!), and also got a flight of beer.   Unfortunately, we weren't fans of any of the beer we selected (but found another brewery nearby that had a really great beer selection).   The setting here is great for friends and we were glad there was no wait for dinner on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Had our first experience at The Suffolk Punch.  I really only have one tip and one complaint for anyone who is visiting. Parking is TERRIBLE. I get that comes with the location, but it was difficult to find a spot on a weekday at 6:00. I really wish they would offer flights - there are so many great beers! (take note, in order to get samples you have to go to the bar, your server will not bring it to your table) Now on to all the great things - what an awesome atmosphere. Good food options and again, nice beer selection. The croquettes were very good and the burger was amazing and flavorful. The creole shrimp didn't give the \"kick\" I would have hoped for, it was almost watered down, so I would probably pass on that in the future.  The burger, shrimp, and croquettes were perfect split between 2 people. Great crowd, and the service was OK. Overall, we will be back for sure. Glad to have found this spot!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a morning cold brew on a hot day and I am glad I did. I love the space inside and out. I need to go back to try dinner."}
{"text":"I sort of want to live here. This place is absolutely adorable! I love the metal pipe shelves, the hanging plants everywhere... it's so hipster that it's beyond hipster at this point. We meant to go for brunch but ended up just hanging out for a little bit. I got a tea with vanilla and Asian pear (YUMM), my sister got a chai latte with oat milk (also yum) and my brother was kind enough to share some of his banana bread with us. Everything was better than we had imagined it would be and we wanted to stay there all day.  Next time I have to save my pennies to buy a growler. They are hand-crafted and well worth the $70 price tag!"}
{"text":"Went there a couple weeks ago on Saturday afternoon. I had been wanting to try it, since hearing and seeing it on social media. Just like someone else said, there's no clear entrance.  Kind of weird. Anyway, we get in there see that there's a coffee bar, then a beer bar around the corner. Plenty of people working, not a single person looked up to say hi, or welcome in, be with you in a sec... ok, so we sit down, after sitting there a bit we realized people don't come to you so we went to the bar to order drinks and food. Again, I came here for the food after reading reviews and seeing pics. We ask for a food menu and the bar tender says, \"we don't serve food anymore.\" And we are like, what? And then he says \"well, we don't serve food until 5pm.\" Uugghh! The whole reason I came was to try the food. I was pretty disappointed. Atmosphere is cute, customer service is pretty bad, and it's lame that food wasn't served until 5pm. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem people do not know about it. Best coffee in town !!! Really great place 5 stars !!"}
{"text":"Four stars for a really gorgeous location and great drink specials. On Tuesday join them for half priced bottles of wine. Most of their wine is $30-35 for a bottle and $8-11 for a glass. You do the math and bring a friend.  Parking here was a bit tricky so walk or bike if you are in the neighborhood. I'm looking forward to another visit and trying more of their menu. However, the three apps I sampled were a little underwhelming.  The charcuterie plate is just that, with the only cheese being a crumbled blue - I wish that was noted on the menu. The spicy mustard on the plate is terrific. If you also order the pimento cheese app (there's your cheese!) they provide the same crostini for  dipping as is on the charcuterie  plate.  Come for the beautiful decor, comfortable chairs and kind service."}
{"text":"Really wanted to try it but 5:15 on a Thursday couldn't find parking spot. Some gobber was taking 2 spots in your parking lot."}
{"text":"Great addition to the breweries that have popped up all over south end. Definitely did this place different from the rest and in a nice upgraded way. Everything from the tables to backsplash are all high end. Right off the light rail stop and free bike rental next to it."}
{"text":"Checked out The Suffolk Punch on opening night with the wife and (1.5 year old) kid...  Great place! Awesome atmosphere, A+ service, fantastic large patio right on the rail trail, great beer selection even before their own brews are available. Food was also delicious, though my only complaint is that some of the portions were a little light for the price point; but hey, that's what you get for a place that's definitely a grade or two higher in class than most of the other brewery options around town.   We got a bit busy trying to keep the toddler busy as the food came out, so I only managed to snag a photo of the potato croquettes, all the food looked as great as it tasted though.   We will definitely be back to sample more of the selection and enjoy the patio sans-kids.    ...went back for coffee/breakfast and it was also fantastic. Loved the draft coffee \"hoptail\""}
{"text":"If we could give half stars I'd give this place a 3.5. I was tremendously disappointed in the pretzels. The cheese dip they came with was cold. I guess it was supposed to come this way but to me and my 2 guests it was not good at all. I've honestly never had cold cheese dip with pretzels or anything else for that matter. I would say they saved themselves with the pimento cheese dip. That was amazing. The beer selection was also great. Service was good as well. I would definitely recommend this place, just not the pretzels."}
{"text":"I've been excitedly awaiting the opening of Suffolk Punch ever since I heard whispers of it. Finally got a chance to check it out and wow! First off, the decor is stunning. Very warm and inviting, rustic yet modern. While I was on a wait, I managed to grab a seat at the bar. I wish I was more of a beer drinker, because I overheard several positive things about their beers while waiting. Instead, I had one of the lime coconut cocktails. I could've easily drank those all night. But lack of alcohol tolerance and no DD, I behaved and had only two. Despite it being pretty crazy, my server Dion was very attentive and friendly. I had the potato croquettes to start with. They were like balls of fried mashed potato goodness, who can go wrong there? My only complaint (it's minor and I'm greedy) is more sauce because it was delicious! For my main, I had the burger and it was well seasoned, hot, and cooked to my preferred temp. I peeped outside on the way out and the patio was huge (and crowded)! I foresee spending many hours there once real Fall weather hits. Overall, my experience was great. I would recommend and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Original menu & tasty beers! Order a burger & it was cooked to perfection. Ambiance was amazing & service was efficient."}
{"text":"I went to try out their coffee, pretty neat and different. Didn't eat any food so not sure how I would rate it. I did try some of their beers. They have 5 of their own. They are ok, nothing too special. The staff was friendly. Looks like they will be brewing in house and not distributing. Reminds me of Heist."}
{"text":"I love bars that have a personality to them and that is definitely Suffolk Punch. It's a massive outdoor/indoor space with cool grass accents. The place has an extensive beer menu, a different menu, and coffee bar. I went for their nachos which came with a cool cheese crema instead of melted cheese."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. However, overpriced food and small portions with slow service means I won't be back. Add to that fact a health rating of 96.5 with two dogs (clearly not service animals) allowed in the dining area, being petted by staff leaves room for doubt about the overall cleanliness and hygiene of the establishment."}
{"text":"There was a bit of a wait on a Friday night which is to be expected, but once we sat down and tried the first bite of food, we were pleasantly surprised by how fresh and tasty everything was. Their entrees were a little on the smaller side, but that might be because we loved the food so much and we wanted more. We haven't tried all their different drink conceptions but we're excited to try those out. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a Friday afternoon and it was packed! It was on/off rain, so the outside bar was closed, meaning that everyone was jam packed inside.  The ambiance and decor are very nice and trendy. We only went here to order drinks and the amount and variety of beers were very overwhelming. TIP: if you have never been here before, you order your beer by the number, not the name of the beer (which goes past 25).   The bartender service was horrendous though. I am reasonable and know that I am not going to get served right away, especially with the number of people that were there. However, I had to wait about 15 minutes standing right behind the bar to finally get someone's attention and order a beer.   Also, the bar area is right next to where people are sitting for dinner so it is very crowded in such a tight space. We were so close to one table that I felt like I was having dinner with them (which, if I were there to have dinner, I would have been annoyed by all of the people right next to me). Once we finally did get beers there is plenty of space down towards the back hallway area.   My biggest cons with Suffolk Punch would be with the inside layout as stated before. There is plenty of room outside (including outdoor games). I would like to give this place a try for food as the dishes did look delicious and when the weather is nice. However, if the weather is NOT GOOD or it is during the winter time where you do not want to go outside, I would not recommend this place as the inside is just too tiny to accommodate everyone in a comfortable space."}
{"text":"Suffolk Punch is a great option in South End and not too far from the light rail. Parking can be challenging as there are no lots and it's all on-street parking. We parked near a friends home and walked over so we had no issues.   The vibe is relaxed and trendy with a slight industrial feel. We had a fairly large party but they were able to seat us right away. Their largest table was taken, but they were able to squeeze all nine of us in a to a six-person table. We appreciated not having to wait.  Water was already set out on the table. And drink orders were put in quickly. They have an extensive beer menu. That night it was only $3 for any Charlotte beers on the menu. There are cocktails, but they don't have a full bar. From what my coworkers said, the cocktails were very good. And there's a few wines on the menu as well. It's definitely a great place to grab a drink.   The menu has both small plates and meals. So you can decide if you want something small or a meal for yourself. I ordered the F.L.T. sandwich with a salad. The F.L.T. was a fried green tomato, bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich on toasted wheat bread with a herbed mayo. I loved this sandwich.  It didn't feel overly greasy, and the fried green tomatoes can be a dish on their own. They were crisp and flavorful.  I wish there was a little more mayo on the sandwich, but it was still satisfying. The side salad was so fresh with green lettuce, raddichio, carrot and red pepper. Normally I order dressing on the side, but they had a very light vinegrette mixed in and was still delicious.    I'd love to come back for drinks and small plates. I regret not getting the charcuterie plate and would love to go back for that."}
{"text":"Horrendous service. We sat at the bar and the bartender was literally ignoring us. Granted his \"bros\" were sitting next to us so he probably was distracted but we waited 10 minutes to get a menu. He checked on his friends multiple times before going on break. When he finally went to say bye to his friends they said \"I think they need their check\" *insert head nod in our direction* and then proceeded to say \"you need to step your game up bro\".  We then paid and went outside to the bar out there. Giving two stars for the pimento cheese dip which was amazing and for the selection of beer."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte a lot for work throughout 2017, and almost every trip I'd make a visit to the Suffolk Punch. Initially I went there for dinner, and was really impressed with their extensive beer list. The food was always good quality, fresh, and changed often to include seasonal ingredients. After a while I discovered they also serve coffee here during the day, and the baristas were all great and very friendly. Service was a bit varied - a couple of times I felt a bit neglected and had to wait quite a while to order or get my bill, but most of my visits I was looked after by one of the regular staff who would take excellent care of me, I was impressed by how knowledgeable they were about the beers, and they'd do nice things like recommend other cool places to check out in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Fun for a casual night out!   We used the no wait app and were seated prior to our time -- which was great!   I was with all beer drinkers, so they ordered a combination of local beers and beer from Hyde (which is apart of the restaurant). I'm a wino - so I perused the wine list and ordered a sauvignon blanc.    We ordered 2 appetizers, the bratwurst and the bc shrimp. I don't eat sausage so I can't speak to the brat, but the shrimp was well cooked and flavorful    For dinner, I ordered the vegetarian nachos with shrimp. While this is an appetizers, it's absolutely huge and makes a great entree! Recommend that!   I feel like the whole coffee, bar, restaurant concept is really growing here. I can't say I've actually ever had coffee here before though.   The ambience and atmosphere is cool. It's a huge space. We sat on the elevated tables near the back of the restaurant. I like that you can see right through to the brewery. It's really neat and different. The outside area is really cool a- I look forward to spending time there this summer!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I really do. The decor is awesome. That's about it. Our waiter Tyler was inept to be nice. He forgot orders, forgot to bring us drinks, napkins, barely came by to even check on us. We ordered a variety of items, the foie gras popcorn was just very salty popcorn. The beet salad and the hamachi crudo were good. The bacon and tortillas were terrible, the bacon was rubbery, the fat was unrendered and gross. My wife got the burger with truffles. $30 for a burger that was not cooked to the temp that we wanted and included flavorless truffles and a very minor amount of them.  I did like the lime and the coconut drink though, 4-5 of them in it felt like I was at the beach! I'd recommend for drinks but def avoid for food."}
{"text":"Fresh local ingredients. I have been wanting to try this place for a while. I finally was in Charlotte for work and was able to go here. I tried the grass fed beef burger, the simple salad with citrus dressing and the morroccan spiced short ribs. Everything was amazing. Very fresh and great flavors. Yum!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. A manager walked by and for some reason lingered but said nothing to us. We never got the second drink we ordered. I get that they're new but my God they need to get it together."}
{"text":"Went here for some after dinner drinks on a Friday night. It was definitely packed, but not so much that we couldn't find a place to sit. I had one of their signature cocktails and it was great. My husband had a beer. We really liked the outdoor area.  The reclaimed picnic tables were really cool and I loved how they had the fake grass under the tables. The inside was equally as nice. I would like to come back here and try the food."}
{"text":"I was finally able to stop in and try this place out!  The espresso was ok, definitely not my favorite but I tried the Suffolk Punch burger and it was fantastic! Also, Walker was extremely hospitable and awesome! Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this place for months.  The decor is great, their beers were solid, good selection of other local breweries and local craft distilleries used for cocktails.  Great concept and something that Charlotte is currently lacking.  But... Full disclosure,  I am a smoker.  A nasty habit, I know.  I went outside to an empty patio to drink and light up.  No complaints for almost an hour.  A manager comes up and mentions that we can't smoke on the back patio, but are welcome to move to the side patio to smoke.  All is good and we happily oblige.  A few minutes pass and a waitress tells us we can't smoke there either.  We mention that we were told to move there by a manager.  She tells us that she doesn't believe us and to put our cigarettes out.  We comply again.  A different manager comes out and asks the waitress if we are causing problems.  At no point were we rude, nor did we not do as we were asked.  I doubt that you will be successful if this is how you treat your customers."}
{"text":"The Southend/Dilworth area of town needs more places like The Suffolk Punch.  It's a huge space that has a little bit of everything for everyone.  Good Food-check.  Good Drinks-check.  Good Atmosphere-check.  When you first walk in, it's a little confusing.  I'm going to The Suffolk Punch, but I think I might be at Hyde Brewery?  I walked in the door and after finally seeing a sign to go to the back of the restaurant, I found the hostess stand.  We put our name in on the No Wait app, so we only ended up waiting for about 15 minutes (vs. the quoted 30-45 min).  As I waited, I looked around at the beautiful plants hanging from the ceiling, the games that were playing on the TVs throughout the inside and the large outdoor space with patio tables.  I thought to myself, this would be a great place to come with a group to watch football!  They can certainly accommodate large groups.  We stopped at the bar to grab a drink first.  Might as well!  Their cocktails were refreshing and their beer list was extensive.  The bar was also really long and they have a ton of taps, so the bartender struggle a bit with remembering drinks as he was running back and forth.  I also noticed that they have a little coffee bar off to the side.  It's pretty hidden, but I wouldn't think to come here in the morning for my caffeine fix.  Once we were seated, we went through the menu.  Starters were the Heirloom Tomatoes (came recommended by the waitress), Summer Squash and Potato Croquettes.  Everything was very good and super fresh!  I loved the Potato Croquettes because, I mean, who doesn't love fried potato balls in a yummy tomato sauce?!  For entrees, we had the fish and the roasted chicken (which was slightly overcooked, but still tasty).  Overall, great new spot!  Food and atmosphere are lively.  Perfect place for a group of people to meet for drinks.  Service was slow all around, so plan to be patient.  Their menu is very inventive, so I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Suffolk. Beautiful relaxed interior, servers and bar tenders were very polite and helpful (HUGE PLUS in charlotte these days). The beer was a fantastic variety, especially given I am not a fan of IPA's, yes I am that women. I had the The Belligerent Blonde, and it was fantastic. It was on the lighter side, had great body, a little citrus crisp flavor and no weird backend finish. The only easy drinking, variental brewery is Sycamore and I am so tired of the same places, so it was refreshing to have a new place to visit. I also appreciated that the crowd was mixed and not all younger southend usuals. It was also the start of restaurant week, so we shall see. TBC, need to try to the food, POST restaurant week. I also can't wait for the warmer weather when the outside deck gets opened up!"}
{"text":"It's hard for me to understand how many reviewers for this brew pub could give it a good  rating. There was not one acceptable thing I could say about our experience. From the start with sloppy bartenders; actually had to ask for napkins to clean up their mess, untrained wait staff,  an inexperienced and bit officious hostess, 3 guys hanging by the hostess stand doing nothing and looking like the 3 stooges.  7  diners ordered 5 appetizers and 7 meals. Meats were dry and over cooked, fried green tomato were to thick, too green and poorly fried, French fries too done in bad oil.  The chef and expediter need to look at what is coming out of their kitchen.  It was an awful experience.  Not planning on a second visit.  Too many other good proven choices."}
{"text":"Loved it. Bacon was amazing.  Beets and goat cheese was fantastic as well. Loved the unique beers and sours on tap.  Great vibe on the inside. Burger wasn't cooked as ordered (med well). Several items sold out and service was a little slow but would not stop us from coming back. We can't wait to go back.  Great for a date night or with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I think the concept is great but one thing that really threw me off was the music playing outside! I know that seems petty but music can totally throw off the vibe of a place. There was oldies and old R&B music playing both times we went! I think they could also use some yard games to liven up the outdoor area."}
{"text":"A+ for the atmosphere. It is gorgeous. B-/C+ for the service and D for the prices.  I went in to order a simple coffee drink. It was not that busy. However, I waited in line for 10 minutes with only three people in front of me because the barista was so chatty.  I ordered a specialty latte - SEVEN DOLLARS (due to locally sourced milk, apparently) - and it was not even that good. (A cold chocolate cinnamon drink, which sounds good, right? It was watery and flavorless.)  The only way I'd come back was if someone else was paying for me. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!! I have always come here for the rosé and brunch but today I branched our and tried a cocktail. I typically get Hendricks and tonic but the bartender said the only have a local gin called cardinal. I probably looked very skeptical because she said don't worry it's really good. I took a chance and wasn't disappointed! Suffolk Punch seems like a place where the staff really cares about the patrons and the food/beverages they serve. If It gets really crowded check out the warehouse behind the outdoor bar- it's a cool place to escape the heat or host an event."}
{"text":"Sunday coffee here may be an under rated gem, can get in and out before the crowds roll in and enjoy a great cup of coffee/espresso/latte.  Pro tip: brunch offering is simple and elegant with a hard 3p cut off"}
{"text":"I have been so excited to try this spot and was equally disappointed with my experience. The two stars are for a few of the cocktails and most of the food we shared. We got there at 730 on a Sat and were given a 90 min wait time...at around 930 we got seats at the bar and patiently waited for the apps we ordered about 20 minutes prior. After we finally received our apps, we enjoyed them without cocktails because no one bothered to check on us again. While most of the food and drinks  were good, I do not recommend going here if you want prompt service and/or are hungry."}
{"text":"Came to this place with high hopes! Bartender was nice but the cocktail list was 13$ so friend and I decided to do simple vodka sodas. Turns out that was the WRONG idea because APPARENTLY a house vodka soda is the same price as any of the cocktails which is 13$. Very disappointed that I was not informed of this. Any bar I've ever been to the house cocktail is cheaper than the specialty drinks. I would've much rather had a specialty drink for 13$ than a house drink for the same price. Would've loved to be informed about the prices."}
{"text":"Wanted so bad for it to be a 5 star. Standing at outside bar, good selection, friendly quick service, all I could smell was cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe of this place, right when I walked in, it had hipster written all over it!  I was in Charlotte for a work trip so I easily snagged a spot at the bar.  The place was packed on a Saturday night, they had this great covered outdoor patio area with a bar outside.  Looked like a great place to hang out.  First off, I get it, it's busy on a Saturday night and I am by myself but it took a very long time to get service.  Definitely why I knocked down this place a star.  I decided to order the carchuittere plate and the fried green tomatoes.  I also had to get a beer, I got the local brewed one and loved it!  The carchurittere plate was very nice, I did wish it had one more soft cheese to it but the meat selection was great.  I am a sucker for fried green tomatoes and this one had a cornmeal crust to it so it was thick and hot off the fryer when I had it.  With the sauce it was a great little dish.    Definitely this place is a great place to hang out with a group of friends and grab some beers but also a good dinner spot."}
{"text":"First impression of this place: WOAH what a gorgeous space! Industrial chic if that's a thing? Levers, pipes, exposed brick, reclaimed wood, hanging plants from the ceiling, and big windows! The restaurant area is one big room with a ton of natural light a relaxed feel, and a ton of seating at booth, table or, bar. There's also a whole patio area that I didn't get to explore, but it looked large as well.   Pro-tip: seating at the bar is first-come first-serve, so if there's a wait, stalk the bar. Works for me and my boo all the time.   We tried the Grouper Ceviche first which was great quality fish and a good sized portion, but the dish was a little plain for me as far as the flavor. Next, we had the Charred Shishito Peppers, which was really flavorful and yummy! Plenty to split between two people. My favorite was the Potato Croquettes which were fried, cheesy, and had an awesome tomato based sauce. All of this shared between two people plus a beer was actually enough to fill me up! If you are super hungry though, you might need a bit more.  Service was decent considering it was their second day open, but they are still working out a few kinks. One major plus is that all register's talk to each other, meaning if you start a tab inside, but then move outside, you can still add more to your tab from anywhere."}
{"text":"The great thing about The Suffolk Punch?  It's a coffeeshop: Offering Hyde Coffee on tap as early as 07:30am on weekdays (09:00am on weekends), as well as fresh and local Whisk & Wood pastries. Lucky you, morning commuters, on South End Rail Trail, this is your grab-and-go coffee spot from the walk-up patio coffee bar.  Loved the Nitro Coffee on-draft.   It's a taphouse: Offering rotating seasonal menu, staring at 11:30am everyday, with soy-, dairy- and gluten-free options. Weekend brunch is every Sat/Sun 10:00am - 03:00pm. Loved the meltingly tender NC Bison Short Rib.  It's a brewery: Offering 48 local taps (Hyde beers & local ones), wine, and cocktails. Try the Midlenhall Treasure cocktail if you know what's goof for you.   It's a Fermentation lab: Focusing on zymology- fermentation process used in beer.  I'm totally in love with the hip, yet inviting industrial dining room, and the forest vibe.   Four Solid Yelps."}
{"text":"So I am a restaurant manager for well known restaurant... I have to say that I was Wowed and I can not say that about very many places.....I have to say to say from the host to server and manager that I was supper impressed... the food was good but that is not what sold me.. Tyler was our server and I do want to give him A+   Thank you!"}
{"text":"I can't review the food or drink because we did not actually stay. When we arrived after using the app to \"reserve\" our place in line, we were told there was an \"issue\" with app and the wait was not 15 min (as the app indicated) but more like an hour (or more). It would have been nice (since they had our number) to contact us an let us know since clearly they were aware this was happening before we drove all the way there and checked in with the hostess. Just a little proactive service goes a LONG way... we probably still would have gone, but since they didn't feel too horrible about wasting our time before we even sat down, we didn't feel it was going bode very well for the overall service."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time here for dinner last Thursday night. Our waiter was Tyler (aka \"Iowa\" or \"Coach\") and knew the menu well and was very helpful during our experience. The menu is def better than the typical brewery menu"}
{"text":"Pretty good.   We went there for brunch and although the menu was short there were plenty of good options.  The omelette I ordered was one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is a very nice brewery, I love the decor and the ambience, definitely a nice spot to hang out.  Food is farm to table so not many colorful options if you will, limited choices honestly. I got the burger because it was the most appealing thing on the menu, but it was underwhelming. No condiments are on the burger, and it had sour pickles and carrots of all things as garnishes. Even with ketchup there was not much flavor. The French fries were amazing! The drinks were decent, no frozen options, but I enjoyed the cocktails I tasted. I was not very impressed by the service, in fact I watched our bartender ask me and my two friends if we wanted to leave our tabs open (we all said yes), and then proceed to close each of them out as if she didn't know what an open tab meant. I'm not sure if she didn't feel we were good for the money or what, but she knew what she was doing, because the man who ordered a drink and food after us also indicated he wanted his tab open and I watched her put his card in the card box. Hmmm... I didn't appreciate that, actually it was offensive.   Patio is dog friendly and there are nice shades to keep the sun off. Oh and fresh mint in the potted plants! I may give it another try in hopes of better treatment by the staff."}
{"text":"I really think it is ridiculous that paying customers have to leave their tables even if they have a 150 dolars open tab and the waiter comes and asks us to leave our table \"encourage\" us and we wanted to order food. This is ridiculous"}
{"text":"Such a great place to grab a beer and hang out on the patio. The food is fantastic and the bartenders are even better! Mike is super knowledgeable and makes great drinks, despite being an A's fan. I can't wait to drink my way through the entire new fall cocktail menu!"}
{"text":"I tried Suffolk Punch for the first time a few weekends ago. It was a pretty slow Saturday morning so we were seated quickly. My boyfriend & I both ordered the chicken & egg biscuit. It was huge! The chicken & gravy had so much flavor. It was amazing. I had drip coffee with seasonal fruits and my boyfriend had an iced cappuccino with chocolate/ cinnamon flavor. We both really enjoyed our meals. I would recommend Suffolk Punch for a good brunch"}
{"text":"This was an unfortunate experience for something that we had high hopes for.  My family and I were evaluating this location for a rehearsal dinner event and had notified one of the managers that we would be coming in.  After waiting around for a while we were told that there were no tables big enough for our group of 7 and that we would have to wait for some tables to clear out.  After an hour and 15 minutes we inquired again about a table and were told that there are only booths that would not be large enough for our party.  We inspected for ourselves and discovered that the booths were plenty big and we could have likely been seated at least a half hour earlier.   While one of the managers did start our night off with a complimentary plate of pimento cheese, this nice gesture was soon overshadowed by an impatient waitress.  As we were ordering the waitress was bold enough to tell a member of our party that \"if she did not hurry up her order she would have to leave for another table.\"   Hoping that the food would make the wait worthwhile we were largely disappointed.  The green tomatoes and pork belly were both bland as was the shaved beef sandwich.  The best dish we were served was the short rib and that was still overly salty and does not stack up to other barbecue options available in Charlotte.   Overall this was a very poor experience and if you are looking for a brewery experience with some good food, don't waste your time on Suffolk Punch."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome beer made in house. Great space for March Madness and enjoying the St. Patrick's Day scenery:) very unique menu with delicious southern inspired food."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had food and drinks. The food was great and the service even better. The bartender, John, was fantastic! We had an Old Fashioned, deviled eggs, and the beet salad all of which were delicious! Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I want to help you, Suffolk Punch. I realize that your restaurant doesn't officially open until this weekend (by the way amazing restaurant atmosphere), so I understand there should be some leeway in terms of service/food, etc. Unfortunately, real money was spent. I went with my girlfriend and another couple, three of us got burgers and one got the grouper. This was in addition to a few rounds of Hyde beers and shishito peppers. Between my gf and I, the bill was $71 after tip! It's just burgers and beer! There are A LOT of places to get that in Charlotte, and not spend half that, AND you're brewing beer on site. On top of that, the fries were lukewarm, the other couple said the foie gras popcorn \"tasted like regular popcorn but for $6\", and the burger was so, so, so salty. We're an easy crowd to please, and we all agreed it was a forgettable meal. I hope you can work out the kinks, because the location and atmosphere are great. The food, not so much."}
{"text":"Beautiful place food is great but the atmosphere is lacking.... It's like it's missing something fun or exciting. Expensive drinks $12 each are full of ice. Way to much ice in a $12 drink. Good staff just boring. After dropping $30  with tip for 2 icy drinks we left not staying for the food. This was my 2nd visit first had the waguBurger. Really delicious. Beer brewery but need more wine choices."}
{"text":"Finally made an overdue visit to The Suffolk Punch for lunch. I had the cross-cut Moroccan ribs for a starter and the Shaved Wagyu Beef sandwich with fries.  The ribs were delicious, with a wonderful African/Middle Eastern spice on top of smoky meat. The portion was plenty for 2 people to split - actually quite surprising for $10.  The sandwich was on point! Tender beef, thinly sliced/shaved with crispy onion strings and horseradish on a Kimmelweck bun with a cup of au jus to dip. The au jus could've used a little more seasoning (mainly salt), but nonetheless, the sandwich as a whole was wonderful. The French fries were noticeably fresh cut and perfectly seasoned. Probably some of the best fries I've had in Charlotte.  I'm curious about the English Muffin Burger, so I'll be back for sure! They also have a coffee shop, and this place is part of Hyde Brewery, though I didn't try the coffee or beer."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here for lunch on President's Day with my husband and co-workers. We ended up staying for two hours because we were having such a nice time. The service was great, efficient and checked in with us just enough, refilled waters without asking and was friendly but not annoying. We ordered a bunch of small plates to share with the table(I'm a sucker for small plates). We got the chorizo croquettes, the pimento cheese, the nachos with steak, pretzels with cheese dip, and the prosciutto platter. Everything was really tasty, but the standouts we're the onion jam and tomato jam on the prosciutto platter and the pimento cheese. So freaking good. Someone else at our table got the blt and it was the best blt she had ever tasted. So, while the food was great, the beer was amazing as well. They are doing really interesting things like using lavender in their saison, and rosemary in their Porter. So delicious. We liked it so much I took my brother in law and sister here two days later for coffee and drinks (did I mention they have a full coffee bar, and it's great too). I guess my only advice is to come here in the afternoon or on a day off when it isn't so busy and you'll have the best experience instead of a crowded Saturday night."}
{"text":"Enjoyable atmosphere, great brewery with plenty of vegan options. Service a little slower than what I would feel comfortable with."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been here, and everyone was great when I had a question. It sucks that some of my friends missed the cut off for food past what I was told, but I've worked in a kitchen before so I get it if you're off. I'm looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"This is the first time we've been here for dinner, and we really enjoyed our time here! While we came by for coffee one morning, that previous experience was topped quickly by our dinner tonight because our server was Tyler. He was so friendly, helpful and accommodating to my husband's random requests. He made our experience great!"}
{"text":"Separate review from Hyde Brewing - but go check them out too! Great beer!  I've eaten at Suffolk Punch twice, and have been impressed by two dishes: the potato croquettes and the veggie burger. The Goose had never had a croquette before (I lived in Spain for 6 months so those things are my kryptonite). The croquettes at Suffolk Punch lived up to the dish's expectations! Creamy and perfectly crisp on the outside. Nom.  The veggie burger gets a shout out because it puts a different spin on a pretty standard dish. The patty is quinoa/black bean, which is pretty normal, but they jazzed it up with a tangy BBQ sauce and goat cheese. It was surprising and delicious! The hand cut fries did pretty well too :)"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Charlotte hands down! This will definitely be one of my summer spots and the customer service is sooo good. My mom, sister and I visited this place this past Saturday around 1 in the afternoon. We sat outside on their back patio area and the weather was absolutely gorgeous. We sat ourselves then went up to the counter and ordered a carafe for mimosas and our food. The bartenders in and outdoors were friendly and made great drinks. I believe outside you could only get bloody marys and mimosas but inside is where I ordered our second round of drinks. My long island ice tea was average, my sister loved her cucumber drink and my mom enjoyed her bloody mary. The food came out speedy and piping hot! I had shrimp and grits which were perfectly seasoned. The atmosphere is what I love most about this place. Its honestly one of those places you just have to try out for yourself because my description won't do it justice. I also like the crowd. Very laid back, friendly, and it was somewhat diverse. Its located in the beautiful and constantly developing south end area of Charlotte. Do yourself a favor and check this place out on an early Saturday afternoon. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to here since they opened. It was good. A wide array of beers on draft. The food was ok, creole shrimp just average. What purpose did the homey serve in the dish? None. The Moroccan rub ribs were better . Both dishes needed seasoning . Put some salt in the dishes."}
{"text":"This place had so much hype leading up to the opening and I have to say it doesn't quite lead up to all the hype.  I got excited when I heard they were going to have a morning coffee window, and then quickly disappointed when it was fancy, extremely over-priced coffees.  Food was good, but they are small plates and having a meal gets expensive there.  I do like their patio, it's a great space and they have done a great job with the space both inside and outside.  Very unique and different.  To me it just does not have the feel of a brewery and they serve more beers from other breweries than their own."}
{"text":"A great environmental with both a beautiful interior and exterior! We brought our Pup here and we loved that we were able to enjoy some goods bears and food while our dog got to lay by us and see other pups! This is such an awesome restaurant in a cool area. Right by the light rail and trail, we are able to either take the rail or walk our dog down the trail while enjoying the restaurant! Would definitely recommend to anyone new or living in the Southend area. We will definitely be back and cannot wait until it is warmer and can hang outside more with our pup!"}
{"text":"Really nice interior decor...That's all I can really say.   The food was average at best and the service (albeit I've only been once) was pretty awful! The waitress admitted to not knowing the menu very well and would forget to find out the answers to our food/drink questions and then would also forget to return to ask what we would like to order. One drink was clearly wrong and the waitress made up a story about how this was a new drink. Coffee with milk was ordered, tea with milk was given (with a tea bag)...and we were told the tea leaves in the bag were coffee...   Perhaps others will have better experiences here, we just will not be returning."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is awesome.  Great job integrating the  outside space with the inside space.  Food and service were both great!"}
{"text":"Giving 4 stars because I went on their 3rd night open so giving them a pass on some stuff related to just getting started. The atmosphere is the best part which is meaningful in charlotte where a lot of new places are built in a spec space with minimal upfit. The food was OK. Mussels and shitshito pepper were a 8/10. Burger was over salted so a 5/10 relative to all the good burgers in town. We got a blue gin cocktail that was sent back. They did take off the bill and replaced with a nice rose at no charge. Service was good not great but most hiccups just new place kinks expected with large crowds. Staff was high quality probably just a little overwhelmed. Will go back in a few weeks with hope the food and drink are a bit better. At worst it's a good place to hang and drink the beer and wine."}
{"text":"Understandably, this place is new so it's PACKED on weekends. My friends and I went on a Friday night for dinner and drinks. We had a party of six and about an hour wait as they only serve food inside. The good news was, they have a huge patio to hang out on. Downside, you have to wait inside to get drinks before finding a seat outside. I'd recommend they add waiters/waitresses for drinks outside too especially with the long wait times for tables. Plus more tips for them right?  Anyway, we enjoyed a couple rounds trying a few of their different drafts - the selection is a little overwhelming because there are so many unique options. After about an hour, we were finally buzzed for our table (they text you btw. Or you can track progress via a link to Yelp after you put your name in).  I was a little disappointed at how small their menu is, but figured the burger as seen on other tables looked sufficient.   We started with the pickles which btw are not fried - we assumed they were. For $5 you get a small bowl of homemade slightly dill pickles. They were fresh and tasty at least and came out quick. Next, several of us (4 of 6) ordered the burger and fries, one friend got the bacon and tortillas and another got a salad and the potato croquets.   The burger was delicious as were the fries. The bacon was more like strips of fatty pork belly served with grilled tortillas (I'm so happy i didn't order it because I would have hated it). My friend said they were good enough.   Overall it was okay. I probably wouldn't be a frequent visitor for dinner due to long waits and small selection, but it'd be a great hangout spot to grab drinks and catch up with friends on the patio. Plus they have a killer location right at the light rail."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I got to come here!! I have had it bookmarked for a long time and finally made it. We sat at the bar because it was first come first serve.  There were two seats just waiting for us.  The service was great!  The bartenders all wait on you, do they were very helpful and attentive.  I ordered the mango habanero margarita...ok, 2 of them.  I could've had tons more because it was just that good.  This is how I wish every drink could be: perfect.  If you like spicy, I encourage you to try it.  Ignore the price and get it.  It was amazing.  I also tried the Hyde lavender saison.  I didn't care much for it, because all lavender tastes like soap to me.  It is, however, very unique.  The chicken biscuit with scrambled eggs and gravy was beautiful and very delicious.  I'd love to try some different menu items in the future."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I came here on a date. Beautiful setting and the service was good. Food were tasteful and varieties on drinks. Busy night but somehow we felt like the limelight of the night. :)"}
{"text":"Visited the Suffolk Punch a lil over a month ago and was impressed.  With so many breweries, chef-driven menus and new venues popping up, it may be hard to stand out, but the Suffolk Punch is no wilting violet.  Fabulous tapas, the coffee bar smelled amazing, just the right amount of beer tastes for all, cool space and very friendly, knowledgeable staff.  Highly recommend for a brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"Great place to come and hagn out for a brew or a little bite  Food looks awesome and service st the bar was great ."}
{"text":"UPDATE: the owner Seth responded to my review immediately and corrected the situation. Thanks for the follow up.  See ya soon!  BAD NEIGHBOR: Suffolk Punch is s bad neighbor! After 12am when the staff is clearly ready to go home, they blast Semisonics, \"Closing Time\" at a volume so loud it is clearly done with the purpose to make their paying guest uncomfortable so that they want to go home.  The problem is they overwhelm the neighborhood using the outdoor speakers. This place sits on top of the light rail and the still able to overwhelm the neighbors with sound. Their act breaks all noise ordinances in Charlotte and there is never a cop around when you need one.  The"}
{"text":"An amazing experience! I would highly recommend and will definitely be back. We had the pimento cheese appetizer-the bacon jam was to die for. I also had the arugula beet salad. The mix of flavors in these dishes was fantastic. Will definitely be back for dinner soon to try out the craft beers on tap as well. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the decor is perfect for the location. It helps to smell the amazing Hyde's Brewing coffee as well!!"}
{"text":"Super cute place! Love all the rustic decor with the greenery everywhere. Had a great latte which my husband had the coffee on nitro. I would've loved to check out the food or the beers but I think they only serve food on weekends. We'll definitely come back to try the food another time."}
{"text":"Brunch was amazing here. We were seated immediately with a warm greeting. Everyone was in a great mood - perhaps it was the wonderful weather - but we had exceptional service  Some really cool things about this restaurant/brewery - they have great local beer prices for their Sunday brunch. We're talking $4 or less for a local beer, that's great in my opinion.  I ordered the chilaquiles- they were phenomenal. My friends ordered the French roast and the basic breakfast. No matter what the order - the food was cooked at a great temp, and it tasted fantastic. (Although I should point out that everyone agreed mine was the best, so order the chilaquiles if you can).  All in all - no complaints. The venue was clean - parking was easy to get. The neighborhood is walkable but a good way from downtown so would recommend driving. The bar is large so you could always get a seat there if there wasn't seating too!"}
{"text":"I had a work event at Suffolk Punch, and we had reserved an outdoor space in advance for ~50 of us. The outdoor area is nice and clean. It is a great space for a big group, and affords ample room for mixing and mingling.   The food and drinks were great. What was disappointing was the server situation - our huge group had 1 server. You can imagine how insufficient that was for our group of 50+. I was there for over 2 hours and only got 1 drink the entire time. I tried hunting down the server multiple times to no avail.   Further, our food was set out when we arrived, but we ran out of plates, cups for water, napkins, and water. There was no server to be found to replenish our depleted items. We went inside to request additional waitstaff to assist us, more water, plates, etc. and the indoor staff were not helpful and said our server would be out soon.   When you have a big group coming, and you know this, you need to have ample waitstaff for the group. I would try this place again with a small group, but I am not interested in attending future group events here unless they remedy the server situation."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great! I love the decorations. Overall, it's a very aesthetically pleasing place.  The food was also tasty.... HOWEVER... my friend and I had 1 drink and 2 small plates (nachos and chicken wings) and our bill was $41. That's a little ridiculous.  I think the most disappointing part was the staff. We walked to the hostess stand where 3 girls were standing. None acknowledged us. Finally, my friend asked a short haired, blonde girl if it was seat yourself (more as a \"why haven't you acknowledged us?\"). She seemed extremely confused.   After we were sat, it took a bit for someone to come to our table. When she did, she immediately told us that she wasn't sure if we were her table or not and if we weren't, someone different would be coming over. Ok?   I ordered a cocktail and she told me that because my cocktail didn't fall in line with what was on the cocktail menu, and it was \"that time of the day\" (aka 4pm on a Saturday), she didn't think the bartender could accommodate my request. It literally was the difference of grabbing one type of vodka vs. another. The even stranger thing was that there was a note on the menu stating that other cocktails besides what was listed on the cocktail menu could be made.   After all that, my drink was not good, at all.  When we ordered, it was clear that the waitress didn't know the menu. We asked for the nachos to come without onions and she responded that she wasn't sure if it came with onions and grabbed one our menus to check."}
{"text":"I heard really good things about this place after it opened, so I scheduled a happy hour here.   Walking in, I immediately loved the decor. All of the plants are my favorite part. It was nice out so we sat on the patio.   They have a really large drink selection from their own beers, to other craft beer, to ciders, to cocktails. I had a cocktail and some ciders and they were all really good.   I ordered some small plates: the Pimiento cheese, the beet stained deviled eggs, and the tuna crudo. I enjoyed all of them, but they were a little expensive for the portion sizes you got.   My experience was pretty good until it started to get dark and cold outside and we tried to go inside. They wouldn't let us sit inside unless we ordered an entree. Given that we had already eaten and were trying to enjoy the brewery, this was very frustrating. I get that it's also a restaurant, but the fact that there is no way to enjoy the brewery without being outside is ridiculous.   We convinced someone to order an entree and the service inside want very good. The burger want cooked as ordered and the service was slow. The food is also pretty expensive.   I've avoided going here for happy hours since then because I don't want to be forced to sit outside if I don't want to eat. I think this is a pretty big problem they need to solve if they don't want to be a restaurant exclusively."}
{"text":"ahhh... so much potential!!!  If I had to rate The Suffolk punch purely on decor and ambiance, I'd give it a whole 5 star rating. Unfortunately, there's so much more to consider. The food was average at best, the service was really quite terrible (the drinks took foreverrrrr to get to us, some things never made it to us at all, our server kept disappearing for long periods of time) The first time we went there in the morning for a cup of coffee, we were so excited because 1) the coffee was awesome 2) the decor was even more awesome. We couldn't wait for them to be open for dinner. and when they were, we decided to check it out with some friends. We ordered a lot of food, almost everything on the menu - from the potato croquettes to the foie gras popcorn, from the beet salad to the pickles, the punch burger to the market fresh fish - and while non of the food was terrible, none of it was memorable either. The overall experience however was a memorable one because it was expensive and underwhelming.  The drinks that did make it to our table were good, but when you have to wait 20 minutes for a drink, they ought to be amazing - either the drink menu needs to be simplified, or the bar service upped. There's tremendous unrealized potential here... perhaps things will improve with time?"}
{"text":"Pretty pricey but good food and beer! Plenty of room to just hang out! I like the beer samples but wish they offered a flight!"}
{"text":"Love love love the brunch here! First time today trying it & we will definitely be back. I'm from CA so I don't love fried foods but the chicken & biscuit was amazing! Lightly fried & a side of fruit to balance it out"}
{"text":"Okay - huge disclaimer. We visited during the 2nd day of their soft opening, so they have a bit of growing pains to get over. That being said, I'm really excited for where Suffolk Punch is going to go.  The Lady and I went around 7:45ish and parking was a little tight, but we were able to find a spot in the side lot at the very back. We walked in from the door that's on the street...which is apparently not the front door. Weird. Would like to have seen signage for that. We walked down the hallway to the big expanse that is the main room. It's a gorgeous, open space with plenty of greenery hanging from the rafters, and a wrapping outdoor patio that's pretty incredible as well.  We found the hostess (again, at the complete opposite side of the building than we walked in from) and she told us it was going to be about a 30-45 minute wait. Woah. So we found 2 seats at the bar by the \"coffee cage\". It definitely did take some time for somebody to notice us, and there were no drink menus to be found (we had to ask for them twice during the duration of our stay) which was a bit of a frustration, but it didn't bring me down too much. We both ordered beers (Pro Tip: Order by #, it'll make the waiters lives a lot easier!), and then we went on to food. Everything came out fast, which was a giant plus! We got:  Grouper Ceviche: Light, citrisy, a bit spicy, and a great texture. I missed the aromatics, but enjoyed the radish. Might've been nice for a bit more crunch in there, but very good nonetheless. Charred Shishito Peppers: One of my favorite snacks. There's no way you can mess these up. Killed em in a matter of minutes. Potato Croquettes: Excellent! Dense, moist, flavorful, and fried. Perfect combo. Loved the tomato and gruyere was a *perfect* cheese choice! Charcuterie Plate: Big hits and a few qualms. 1) There was only 1 cheese on the board. Granted, one was peppered and one wasn't, but it wasn't very balanced. 2) Meats were cut at very different sizes. 3) Picked onions were sweet and delicious, whole grain mustard felt like it was kicked up with horseradish or wasabi, but both excellent. 4) I learned that duck pate is not my thing. And that's okay. I think it was done very well, but the taste is a bit more refined from what I was in the mood for. It was also strange that the duck fat was hard and on top. Didn't know if I was supposed to eat that or not...  Prices were totally acceptable for the portions that we got (2 drinks and 4 menu items totaled out to just under $50, and we walked away pleasantly full).   They need to get their roastery started up, as well as release their own beers, and do more with food fermentation. But, in any case, I'm actually really looking forward to seeing Suffolk Punch flourish. They got a good thing going. If nothing else, their 6:30am open time will be *perfect* for early morning coffee sessions :)"}
{"text":"I ordered most of the small plates for dinner instead of a meal because I felt like I would be able to eat a different variety of food. Everything was delicious. What I remember ordering was the short ribs, croquette, pork belly, meatball, raw tuna, and fried green tomatoes. I was very full with the help of a friend. The atmosphere was cozy and the service was good. Possibly make a reservation if you're going to come on a busy night. There's parking all around, so it shouldn't be a problem."}
{"text":"Love some Pimenta Cheese and Bacon jam. Combine them together for a real treat! No but seriously, just order one of everything and see if you can fit it all on the table. I think it's worth it. - Rockett"}
{"text":"Located off exit 7 on I-77., there are quite a few breweries you might miss out on if you think downtown charlotte is where you need to go.  There's indoor restaurant style seating and bar seating or outdoor tables for some fresh air. The setup is open and modern. A great place to chill if you have down time. Suffolk Punch has great food, excellent coffee , and of course beer.   Lenny Boy brewery is a couple blocks away for Kombucha or draft beer, as well.  Triple c brewery is next door. Olde mecklenberg brewery is 6 minutes away by car.   The light rail stop (new bern stop) is right behind Suffolk. Hit up the next stop or rent a bicycle (https://charlotte.bcycle.com ) and try Futo Buto if you want some legit ramen."}
{"text":"Went for a Saturday lunch but they had a brunch menu which was a pleasant surprise. I got the veggie burger and it was by far the best veggie burger I've had in Charlotte. The bbq sauce with goat cheese on it was really good. I usually am not one for bbq sauce  but this one was so good. It was not just sweet but it had a good spice to it. I also got the side salad and it was large for a side. I would definitely recommend the food and will be coming back for dinner sometime!"}
{"text":"My first thought here was \"WOW, this place is beautiful!\" I went for a friend's birthday party for the first time. We sat outside, and I love all the greenery on the tables.   There's not a ton of parking in the area, so be careful. I had a hard time finding parking on a Thursday when Triple C also has their run club... keep this in mind.   Boodle and I shared an appetizer and also got an entree. Overall our food and drinks were really good, but I felt like it was overpriced for what we had.   The staff was great. We had a birthday cake that they stored and brought out when the time was right. They went above and beyond to make my friend's birthday memorable, and that part was awesome."}
{"text":"Really cool new place in Southend. Hyde Brewery provides a great selection of beer on tap, there is a full bar and kitchen and a craft coffee counter as well. I had the Blue Daisy on tap and loved it, definitely recommend.  The decor is beautiful and the space is really calming and inviting. There is a ton of natural light and plants to provide an earthy tone."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place since it is a few blocks from my house. Food is very solid but nothing special for the price. The space is just great. Simply gorgeous. Mixed drinks are insanely overpriced. I generally never get sticker-shock when I get the tab, but when I opened the bill my jaw dropped. This is the type of price I would expect from a rooftop bar like Merchant & Trade but not from this place. This isn't Punch Room... come on. The staff seems fine but they have only one speed... slow. They are nice enough but again, very, painfully slooooow and appear to be lacking in service industry experience. When it is busy, as it usually is, this makes for a long frustrating wait. Bartender didn't know what a pilsner was. I'll be back because of the location but I doubt I'll ever stay for more than a drink or two."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for beer and coffee, but this was my first visit for the food and it pretty good! I love the space and the decor. It reminds me of being in NYC; definitely a lot different than most restaurants here!   We started with housemade pimento cheese, it has bacon jam on it and was pretty good. The bacon jam added more flavor to it. We also got the Suffolk Punch Burger-tasty, but be warned the bun is an English muffin so it did fall apart some while eating. (Forgot a picture!)  Six hour pork belly- a friend ordered this and said it was good, but I didn't try it so you'll have to see for yourself! NC Bison Short rib- perfectly cooked, fell off the bone and was so tender. It sat on top of polenta and had a nice glaze to it.   We'll definitely be back whether it's to watch some games or enjoy a cup of coffee or beer. I'll have to try out more of the menu next time!"}
{"text":"Check out the new kid on the brewery block. This brewery is across the street from one of the best breweries in Charlotte, Triple C. The bad thing, parking is now terrible around here. I drove around a lot before finally deciding reluctantly to part in front of one of the buildings that didn't have a sign saying they would tow your car away. My suggestion, since this brewery is located right next to a light rail station, is park in the train lot and right the train here.  This place was absolutely packed when we arrived around 5 pm. I'm amazed that there are that many people available! given the number of breweries. I think because they have a great food option as well, it makes this place like a super brewery. They have a large outside area and a large inside area. I think they kick people out of the inside tables around 5 pm and it begins to be used exclusively for sit down table service. We got on a waiting list and it took about 45 minutes to get a table, fortunately, we got an outside table. Less noisy and the weather was really nice. They also have an outside tap area, so you can get a beer outside, and sit at the outside picnic tables and avoid the crowded inside area. They weren't brewing their own beer yet when we went there, so have to wait on that. They had lots of other local craft options and a full bar service.  This remains me a of a wicked weed style place. A little higher end business feel, with lots of beer and food options. Its not your typical brewery feel. Its good, and will always be packed I think because it offers so much, but it doesn't really have a brewery feel either. I'll be back, but might stop by the real brewery, Triple C first, first for a beer before crossing the street to get some good food!"}
{"text":"My personal experience was an afternoon coffee. I gave the barista freedom to create and he did not disappoint! Most amazing oat milk spiced latte I have EVER had! Finished with nitro coffee to go and can't wIt for the next visit :)"}
{"text":"Hex is delicious and Brandon was the most amazing barista that I have ever come across!  This is always my spot when I come into town for drinks and now I'll be coming in twice a day.  Cannot say enough wonderful things about Brandon and Mike.....and the place altogether.  Almost makes me want to move back."}
{"text":"After spending a week in Charlotte for work, I needed a beer (or 4). The Suffolk Punch mixed two of the best things on the planet: quality food and craft beer. The outdoor seating is hip and plentiful; long wooden tables and benches sit under a hanging of string lights. The tables have their own collections of succulents, and the benches give a community vibe. I ordered the Suffolk Punch burger and a flight of five beers. The burger came with a pretzel bun, bourbon mustard, gruyere, and pickles. Word to the wise: I ordered it medium rare and it was pretty close to rare, so order a bit warmer than you normally would. The burger was a little messy, and I've learned I don't like pretzel buns, but a solid burger. Friends got the shaved wagyu sandwich (with gruyere, jus, and horseradish cream) and couldn't say enough good things. If you want to sit outside, you'll only have access to a limited menu, but the inside is beautiful and inviting. I grabbed a five-beer flight, and for $15, I was blown away. The samples were probably 6 oz, and I couldn't finish all five. Definitely a great bang for your buck if you want to try multiple beers. Overall awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Love this place for brunch. The space is warm and inviting with a rustic/industrial feel. Staff is very friendly and quick to deliver. I am a big fan of the fried egg sandwich. Great portion size and big on flavor. Hubby got the chicken and biscuit which was pretty tasty. The beers are pretty good. Wish they had as many coffee cocktails as they had the first time we were here, but I won't hold that against them. Overall, very good and well worth our 45 minute drive to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Yo fuck this place. I've come here a bunch of times for beers or coffee. I came here one night for late night. Said they served food until 11pm and then when we went to order a cheese plate at 10:45 they threw a huge hissy fit. If you're going to serve food until 11 serve it til 11.   The south end needs a place to grab drinks and food late night. This isn't it. Don't come here for that."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but unfortunately I was underwhelmed. My husband wanted to taste two different beers to see which one to order - they do not do tasting portions (weird for a brewery!). We have ordered three different small plates to share - everything was ok. I can't imagine wanting anything again enough to go back.  Sad because I had such expectations"}
