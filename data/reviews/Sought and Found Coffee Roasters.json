{"text":"Owners and roasters create a unique experience from the casual coffee drinker to the coffee enthusiast. The roaster tries to get every ounce of flavour out of every bean.   There's very casual coffee cupping and also offer roasting workshops and tastings.  Great neighbourhood craft coffee shop."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and thought we would try a new coffee place. It was nothing special and service was really slow. I would like to say that I have tried this place but don't think I would go back again"}
{"text":"Ok so being a person that is not a coffee drinker I can't really comment on the coffee.  The tea I had was good not my favourite but they added lavender to a London fog and I'm not big on lavender to begin with and I don't really feel like it's a flavour to add to a black tea and vanilla based drink.  Trendy Looking place really rustic cozy kind of feet to it, with a little bit of pizzazz here and there."}
{"text":"A neat store with a ton of potential! The interior looks cool and would definitely be a go to place for me if only it's not so pricey. For comparison, a latte Tim Horton size small is $5 at this new coffee shop. I'll likely walk across the street still for a grande Starbucks. Similar in pricing but way more quantity!! Honestly, I am very disappointed. Hope it'll be better next time I visit!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, supurb attention to detail, extremely good customer service. Simply delicious. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"I haven't visited the brick and mortar location but my husband picked up a bag of whole beans there, a natural processed Yirgacheffe and they are excellent. VERY cool branding and quality packaging."}
{"text":"Exceptional coffee and service! We loved the flavor and such a smooth after taste. My only complaint would be how tiny the cups are for the price."}
