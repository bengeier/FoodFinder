{"text":"It's not a terribly impressive place, but the service was kind and the tom yum noodle soup was both generously portioned and delicious. The menu is expansive, and the drink menu has a good variety of things to choose from, but I don't know why a cold drink costs a dollar more than a hot one. Nonetheless the food is cheap and good, so I'm happy.  I'll give it four stars because I will say I'm a fan of this place and I think it should be taken up a notch on Yelp."}
{"text":"If you are looking for real Malaysian food or viet food I suggest you to try another place. Owned by Chinese or perhaps Malaysian?  Does not taste very legit, my bowl of pho noodles was tasteless and the soup base was very plain. There are just better malaysian and viet mixed resturants out there!"}
{"text":"Been to Lemon Tree once for dinner, it is a small restaurant that doesn't look to appealing from the outside.  We tried the pho, Hainan chicken, pad thai and curry beef. All of them were average.  Service was very good and food came out super fast.  Other than that there is nothing special about this place to make me return a second time.  Rating:  Service: 4/5 Food Quality: 3/5 Comfort 3/5 Decor  2/5 Value: 3/5 Parking: 3/5"}
{"text":"I agree with Jennifer, the service was super fast!  I had the pho. The broth was very tasty, a tiny bit on the salty side, though. The rare beef was very tender.  My only complaint is that they didn't have salad rolls, which is what I was really craving, but all in all, the food here is very good."}
{"text":"Friendly service, had a variety of things, nothing I didn't enjoy, pho was awesome!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is how I would describe this place. The most fascinating thing about this place is the identity crisis they present. Thai/Malaysian/Viet/Chinese they have it all! (bits and pieces of it at least). Their interpretation of a Pho; 1 part overtly salty stock, 1 part noodles that are somehow chewy, clumpy and crumbly AND last but not least, throw in some grilled (aka - we deep fried it and forgot to seasoned it) lemongrass chicken.   The tom yum stock fared better; at least you can tell it was from a can of decent soup mix. Confusing, bland and better off somewhere else I would say. 2 stars for the over-the-top service. My quest for a decent pho resto in the Markham continues..."}
{"text":"We came in the evening after the ice storm. The Pad Thai I ordered was tasty but not authentic, but tasty was a good thing, wasn't it?  The portion was huge.  The services were good because the restaurant was quiet; I suppose people tend to stay home under the circumstance.   During my stay, I saw a few customers of SE Asian descent picked up take out food.  Maybe other items are more authentic?"}
{"text":"This restaurant is now closed.  Food was good but way too oily.  I tried the pho, hainan chicken rice, etc.  Parking was ok during non-peak hours, staff was friendly and seating was comfortable."}
{"text":"surprisingly this place have a very good hainan chicken. (even though its too oily, but they are really good). they should fix the rice, hainan chicken rice not supposed to be yellow, but I guess its influence from other region. this restaurant is like jack of all country (malaysia, chinese, thai, vietnam ...) so earlier I was skeptical coming in, especially at 11:30, I was the only person in the restaurant. so I order what they have special. I was looking at the menu, they have all kind of stuff, and usually those are indication that you are not going to get anything good out of it. but I think their specialty is more on the hainan chicken. I have not tried other food there (too scared).  I had durian shake (was good) and fish patty (thai snack) not bad."}
{"text":"food was okie, nothing really spectacular and prices medicore.  this place always seems empty. only tried the viet food so far though. would like to try other things on their menu since they had a good variety"}
{"text":"Came back to Lemon Tree and have the Malaysian Style Rice Noodle ($8) for a late lunch and totally disappointed.  My noodles just swimming in an ocean of oil........ a dish of oiliness with hardly any taste...... definitely not Malaysian style...    I wiped my oil mouth and I don't think I will be back."}
