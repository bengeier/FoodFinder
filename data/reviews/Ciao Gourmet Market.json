{"text":"Rating: 3.5. 

Expensive prices? Yes, as expected at any US airport.
The store is located at the gate D.

Creative healthier snacks, fresh salads, premium sandwiches, fair trade and non GMO \"Divine\" dark chocolate with ginger and orange, \"Kind\" bars, protein bars, etc. located near a sushi and coffee spot, table to recharge electronics, clean restrooms, etc."}
{"text":"$14 for the \"meal\". Gees, airport prices are out of control. These wraps, put together, are about the size of my entire hand (NOT including the fingers). So small :( The wrap was decent, but nothing to brag about. Fresh ingredients, nothing added. That's a plus, considering all the potential sauces, extra ingredients, etc they could have tossed in for kicks. And the yogurt, again, the title pretty much is it - no surprises.  

But, still, $14?!! It's times like these that make me appreciate the low cost of living we get in Ohio."}
{"text":"Sandwiches had no prices on.  $9.50 fora Caprese sandwich.  Not impressed, should have eaten somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food on the go is always a little challenging to find... especially at the airport.  They basically have you cornered!  The Ciao Gourmet market is located in Terminal D and it shares it's space with a sushi spot and a coffee place.  

It's one step \"up\" than a grab and go convenience spot, but the most memorable thing I took away from here was purchasing a beer, and the cashier telling me I cannot leave the area and have my beer in the dining area.  She then proceeded to watch me like a 3-year-old in the possession of craft paints and white walls in the house.   The place wasn't busy, and I knew better than to go swigging a beer around the gates - but I guess she didn't want me to get into trouble (more likely:  she did not want to be responsible for me).

There are limited options in Terminal D but you can grab some decent snacks here.  Brace yourself for airport pricing..."}
{"text":"Most of the grab-n-go spots look the same at airports. Sandwiches that are much more bread than meat/cheese and salads that look wilted. Ciao, in the D concourse, looks a bit more lively. They say \"gourmet salads and sandwiches\" and while it's not quite \"gourmet\", it's definitely better than most.

The chopped chicken salad looks to be the best option.

Some tables nearby had power outlets."}
