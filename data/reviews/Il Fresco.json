{"text":"Great Italian pasta and delicious mushroom soup. Good price, I will get the stone pizza next time."}
{"text":"I used to visit this large room when it was another restaurant. The space has been updated and has a chic appearance. The menu is varied but the lunch selections are too limited. The wine list was reasonable and average prices. I thought that the food was somewhat overpriced and the quality didn't quite warrant. Lunch for two, with one small glass of wine and dessert was close to $80.00 with tip. Although the food was tasty and nicely prepared and presented, it's not a spot I'll return to regularly, cost being a factor."}
{"text":"First visit: really enjoyed the ravioli special (chicken, spinach, red cream sauce). Ravioli dough as good as my Maltese nunna used to make--can't get better than that! Sauce was perfect--not gluey like a certain other Italian pizzeria on Old Kingston Rd. Generous portions; attentive service. Husband thought his pizza was very good. Dinner for two with appetizer, dessert, tax and 20% tip $77. Site of now defunct Thai Indeed (much missed!). Happy that the new restaurant seems a good replacement. We'll definitely come back."}
