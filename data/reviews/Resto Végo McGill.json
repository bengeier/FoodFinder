{"text":"I was on a girls' weekend trip to Montreal and we had one vegetarian and one vegan with our group. We were just wandering on our way to the train station and came across it. Even if you aren't a vegetarian or vegan, it's still delicious. They have soups and a salad bar, so it's perfect for a light lunch. I had a tomato soup and salad and it was delicious. They also had cooked food- like vegetarian shepherd's pie, spaghetti squash pasta, roasted veggies, along with desserts, juices and coffees. The setting was lovely, the staff were nice and it was very clean. There were also big windows, so it would probably be perfect for a sunny mid-day coffee and snack or slow, light lunch."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh. The place is clean and nice. I love the view from the windows. You have really a lot of choice. The only thing is the price, it is a little pricey.
Thanks.

Lss aliments et les plats sont toujours frais, vouz aurez un grand choix. Le bar à salades est formidable, il y a des sauces qui viennent avec. La place est propre et joli. La vue est belle. Seulement à chaque fois je suis étonné du prix à la fin :)
Merci."}
{"text":"A Montreal hidden gem overlooking the bustling McGill college street. My favourite part of this restaurant is the quiet and calm atmosphere. Not packed with people and noise like the rest of the street and lots of lighting and a great view. Food is great but a bit expensive."}
{"text":"We really regretted coming here. The staff aren't friendly and unable to communicate in basic English to explain their weird \"buffet\" system.

To keep it simple, there's no buffet here. It's all weighed by scale.

Just based on the service, horrible food and horrendous fake advertising I would give it zero if I could.

There was one dish, I believe it was tofu loaf which tasted like it was rotten.

Beware."}
{"text":"Although the food was quite good, it was extremely overpriced. To be honest, I assumed that it was a buffet, but let's be real, when you go to a buffet you don't expect to pay by the weight of your food. The employee who was working that day assured me that I wouldn't pay over 15$ for my plate. Long story short...I got to the cash, and it ended up costing 20$. Also, I'm 98% sure that you pay for the weight of your (heavy) plate in addition to your meal because there's no way that my food weight 1kg. Shocking. Save your 20$ and go eat grass."}
{"text":"Came here after going to a different location yesterday. Amazing food and selection, great prices, friendly staff, we couldn't be happier! Vegetarian or not you should try it."}
{"text":"Horrific; Cold food that is overpriced and not seasoned at all. 

As for the service, it's almost like the staff is paid NOT to care about your needs.

I don't believe this place will be in business for long."}
{"text":"Found this place on a blog for best vegetarian foods in Montreal. Although the name listed at this same address was Commensal. It is cafeteria style food. Food is charged by weight. We went in the late evening and some of this buffet food looks dry, like the carrot sticks and the salad looked like it was withering. Perhaps it is better during lunchtime or whenever the food first comes out. We decided to try the food there anyways. Had a bit of the spaghetti, some vegetables and the spring roll. The spring roll skin was not crispy, but was edible. The food wasn't memorable. It's good to see an all vegetarian place, but I don't know if I would go back considering there were a bunch of other vegetarian restaurants on that same blog."}
{"text":"Formerly Le Commensol, currently named Resto Vego, I decided to give it a go after a workout today. I was a bit hesitant to try this place because I was not a fan of Le Commensol at all, but I told myself to let go of my bias because this is a different place now. To my surprise, it was pretty much still the same cafeteria look with a buffet style choices as before. 

Good : Since I enjoy eating salad, it's safe to say this is a cheaper alternative to Mandy's if you want to eat a light healthy salad. You can throw a big bowl of spring mix, add some toppers, other veggies, and it will be about $5 because it's sold by weight. You can also get 10% student discount.

Bad: The decor is very plain and not the most inviting, you feel like you're eating in a prison cafeteria. The hot food wasn't good, but it wasn't completely bad either. It's exactly what you would expect for cafeteria food. 

Bottom line: I would only come here to eat salad on a budget. There are way better vegetarian options within walking distance like Crudessence or Green Panther."}
{"text":"I like the buffet-style concept, as its fun to pick and choose what you like . The decor is basic but spacious and there is always plenty of room to sit.

Most of the food looks good and sounds interesting, but unfortunately the taste doesn't match up...ive found most of the dressings/sauces the food is in very vinegary and lacking any kind of flavour. Often it is quite dry and stodgy.

If you want basic veggie food at a reasonable price then its a good place to go, but there are definitely other options nearby where you can get something a lot more flavourful and tasty..."}
{"text":"The worst of steam table food:  mostly tasteless and dried out.  Pricey for bland stuff.  The pizza was fresh but was on a terrible crust and had no taste.  There are so many better choices nearby."}
{"text":"We had an afternoon meal in this place. The staff were very friendly and helpfull. We like buffet restaurants because they make it possible to collect exactly the type of food that you want in the amount that you like. We enjoyed our meal and we will certainly be back when we are in the neigbourhoud."}
{"text":"Pure veggie, but generally quite overpriced. It's a self-serve cafeteria place with the final price based on weight.  

Went today and we found the selections to be stale, poorly presented and inconsistently cooked.  Some dishware was dirty.  My wife was nauseated by her dish to the extent that it spoiled the afternoon. My brussels sprouts tasted and had the texture of having been on the cooker for the last 6 hours, which I suspect was actually the case. The unilingual French signage regarding specials sent an unwelcoming message to Anglophones. Even though I have been a vegetarian for a decade,  I'll settle for even the minimalist Burger King veggie option before I return."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for a snack while on a shopping trip. Since it's a buffet style place we each had a little bit of the different dishes offered. Some of the food looked okay but a lot of it looked like it had been sitting for quite a while and needed to be removed. I had a very small portion of couscous & a Moroccan veggie mix with a coffee and it came up to over $11! The rest of the family tried tiny portions of lasagna, veggies, marinaded avocado and burrito. For a family of 4 with snack size portions it came up to $65!! Half of the food was inedible and the rest was barely passable. The staff looked bored but the place was clean and bright. Overall it was a truly unsatisfying experience and I cannot recommend this place to anyone because of it."}
{"text":"Le Commensal changed its identity to Resto Végo but it keeps the same format; a healthy buffet which charges in function of plate weight. Resto Végo offers a variety of warm and fresh vegetarian and vegan dishes in a clean setting and with a great view of Ste-Catherine and McGill College Street. During all my years as a vegetarian in Montreal, I have rarely been disappointed by the food offered at Le Commensal and the same  applies at the new Resto Végo. The menu is decent and it's varied. My only honest complaint is pricing; I feel the food is slightly overpriced, not enough to make me swear to never set foot there again, but expensive enough that I space out my visits to a couple of times a year only. I feel I can get more for my buck elsewhere. I recommend nonetheless, especially if you have a smaller appetite."}
{"text":"Gras, peu varié, fraîcheur discutable. Son pendant de la rue St-Denis fait bcp mieux."}
{"text":"Super bon ! Sorte de cantine avec buffet ou l'on paie au poids. On peut donc goûter un peu a tout et c'est exclusivement végétarien-végétalien (bien que l'on trouve plus de plats et desserts végétariens que végétalien malheureusement). 
On peut aussi bien emporter grâce aux boites mises a disposition que manger sur place (petite astuce pour ceux qui sont prés de leur sous : même pour consommer sur place, on peut prendre les boites qui sont plus légères que les assiette et ainsi avoir un plateau plus léger a la caisse^^).
J'y suis allée deux ou trois fois et c'etait toujours trés bon, les légumes sont frais et tout est bien cuisiné (coup de coeur pour le cheese cake vegan au citron et coulis de fruits rouges !). Je recommande donc aux vegans et végétariens d\"aller y faire un tour !"}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side for what you get, Resto Vego offers tasty veg friendly food with several vegan options clearly marked both hot and cold.  The staff are friendly, but many of the named dishes taste wrong (where's the Masala in the Chana Masala?).  Overall, Resto Vego is a good stop if you need something fast and hot that's vegetarian or vegan and you don't mind paying a little extra."}
{"text":"Some things were very delicious while other had been sitting in a food warmer all day. Hit and miss"}
{"text":"My vegetarian friend took me there. 
Actually I'm not vegan, so I was scared a bit what could I eat. 
I tried many foods and all of them was tasty and yummy. 
I liked this buffet style, you can take as much as you want. 
Clean place.
I really recommend on sunny days because there are huge windows on the sides."}
