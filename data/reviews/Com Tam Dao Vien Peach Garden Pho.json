{"text":"I'm so sad that they never have soy milk! I'm literally crying because this is the third time that I've been here and they still don't have it! They might as well cross it off their menu. I'm going across the street to the Asian super market to buy some soy milk."}
{"text":"Under new management not what it used to be the food isn't as good. They cater not to Asian community because we know what authentic taste like ..... The seating arrangement there's plenty and its clean. The pho was not up to par with the other places I have been to and the rice dishes were overpriced ... Everything here is overpriced would not come again ..."}
