{"text":"The most tasteful Boba Tea in Phoenix area, the owner is actually very nice, but those two girls who make the Boba tea are a little bit wired...

Personal favorite: Jasmine Milk Tea with Pudding"}
{"text":"Tried the pork chop combo rice ... I love it to bits... The pork is tender!!! And tastes great! If you are a fan of pork leg, you can even request for fried pork leg rice! I've tried the minced pork noodles as well and it taste good!! Everything seems to be great!"}
{"text":"Best boba tea in Arizona!!! Taiwanese food A+++  my personal favorite: loyal milk tea with boba   Best milk tea"}
{"text":"Over rated and super hyped up for nothing.  I'm not saying it's not edible, BUT quality is  like poor fast food ... Just \"asian style.\"  I ordered the chicken plate and Kimchee tofu.  Chicken had no flavor other than the old oil it was pan fried in. Tofu had sweet sauce that came with it but didn't resemble any kimchee flavor. The egg custard in the boba milk tea was the best thing there. The setup is like asian version of the \"Friends show\" cafe scene with TV and area with board games.  Too bad no one was in there to hang out."}
{"text":"Great selection of  AUTHENTIC \"Taiwanese\" food that you can't miss it! - certified by a Taiwanese like me  :-) :-)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Arizona. Delicious boba, and they have so many flavors and varieties to choose from! They have amazing homemade style Taiwanese comfort foods. My favorites are the pan fried rice noodles, popcorn chicken and ground pork noodles. These dishes are so good i'm drooling thinking about them. The prices are also really cheap and the meal portions are perfect."}
{"text":"Very nice boba tea here! Very relaxing feeling and definitely worth coming back again!"}
{"text":"It was a wonderful experience for me to have dinner here. I really miss my hometown flavor. They offered authentic and tasty Taiwanese food. So good! I liked beef noodle soup, beef stew rice combo and appetizers. They were so delicious! I will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"We had popcorn chicken combo (though I wanted ordered popcorn rice only, didn't know he charged combo price), beef noodle, fried tofu with kimchi, and papaya milk. They were terrible, nothing compared to authentic Taiwanese food. The drink was the worst, lots of artificial flavors, yuk! Threw out most of it! We didn't feel good after eating. My husband still feels stomach sick the next day. Regret to drive 12miles for that. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Friendly little cafe with plenty of space to chill and enjoy free wifi. Their boba menu had an option of pudding which was new to me but had the usual milk tea. It's hard to find good boba tea without them killing it with sugar, however Yes Cafe is perfectly sweetened. I also ordered the beef noodle soup and it was the closest you can get to authentic Taiwanese food. A hot broth (be careful) filled with green onions, pickled veggie, thick udon noodles, Chinese broccoli, and good amount of beef all in one. I want to try the fried chicken and tofu next time. This place bring me back to delicious Taiwanese street food :)"}
{"text":"Love coming here for the authentic home made taiwanese food.  Not many options for this type of food in Az so really refreshing to find this place.  They also have really good boba and the owners are very nice.  If you like traditional beef noodle soup, you've gotta try it here"}
{"text":"The cashier refused to accept a $4 Entertainment coupon that the business had to pay to distribute (and I had to pay to get). Without even a half-hearted apology, she giggled and stated she didn't know how to accept it. When I asked for a manager, I was told she would be back in 3 hours (when the business closed).

Poor customer service. Run-down building. Next time, we will spend our money at one of the similar restaurants we passed on the way there."}
{"text":"It's soooo good! Well the boba is, I haven't had the food yet but I'm addicted to their lavender boba tea! Also open late so that's a huge plus :)"}
{"text":"Great place to relax. The staff is very friendly and the milk teas are fantastic. This shop is adorable."}
{"text":"Good milk tea with boba and strawberry jelly.  Good bbq sausage.  Noodles with minced pork was too much noodle, too little sauce and pork.  A little expensive."}
{"text":"Picked up a Thai iced tea for mom and a Peppermint snow/slush for myself, both with boba.

Mine was blended for a touch too long and could use a stronger peppermint flavor, but I appreciate how it wasn't too sweet.  The boba added some nice texture, but didn't have any type of flavor itself.

Not the best, but there was no wait and the woman working the counter was nice."}
{"text":"This place has the best boba tea around hands down!  Friendly, quick staff.  I always get the Thai tea w/ boba and it hits the spot! Just make sure if you bring cash you bring bills smaller than 20's =)"}
{"text":"Hands down, five stars, the best boba in AZ.  New owners make complete turn-around from Lollicup.  Boba is cooked perfectly each time.  They taste their drinks before serving.  I come at least once a week, and the quality is consistent every time. 

Personal favorite: honey milk green tea"}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks. Must try. Have Taiwanese food without going to Taiwan. 
The pork chop combo is my favorite. The pork chop is crispy the pickle vegetables with rice makes a perfect combination."}
{"text":"Best popcorn chicken I've had.  Different but very good.  Clean light cripsy batter with good chunks of lean dark meat chicken.  Not fatty or clunked with a ton of batter like most other places.

The pearl milk tea was decent too, surprised to find Taiwanese food in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Seriously this place has the best boba tea I've ever had. It doesn't compare to any other place. The service is great and I always leave happy. I took my sister here and she absolutely loved it. I'm super happy with Yes Cafe and will  remain to love their boba tea!"}
{"text":"I like coming here for a quick meal and drink. Popcorn chicken and beef noodle stew are a couple favorites. Drinks vary such as the hot almond milk tea pudding, honey dew milk tea and taro milk tea. Chocolate snow is a good cold drink. 
There are super cute drawings specially drawn by one of the talented workers. She sells them for $5 and $10 (8x11 light card board sized paper). $5 is half the size. You can request for her to draw something that you like. 
You can also Come to play board games and chat. 
(This place was formerly Lollicup)."}
{"text":"Yes Cafe is about the equivalent to California's Tapioca Express. It's a boba shop. Nothing special or worth going out of your way for- but it's convenient because they are open later than the other shops around town. 

I will give them one thing though - their food/snacks are delicious! I would recommend the popcorn chicken or calamari. I've yet to try their Taiwanese meals but I've heard good things about them from family and friends. 

Tip: They do not accept card if the total is under $10. So make sure you bring cash if you're just stopping in for a drink!"}
{"text":"We thought it's Taiwanese but it's actually Chinese.  Food is OK and price is OK.


Correction --- It is Taiwanese (got confused with another eatery), as we met the owner.  Still A-OK."}
{"text":"Purchased lunch today. Had a very odd taste we could not identify.  One dish had heavy cilantro masking the odd taste.  Service was not very good.  We could not eat it and we left after one taste of each dish.  We have had a lot of good boba and noodle soups.  This is not the place to get it."}
{"text":"Most authentic tasting Taiwanese food in Arizona. Good food quality and portion. Not too expensive.  Quick service and super friendly staff. Would recommend to everyone who is in town!!!"}
{"text":"The egg waffles were filling. However the beef rolls were little and expensive in comparison to other fancy restaurants I've been"}
{"text":"The best popcorn chicken and boba milk tea that I ever have."}
{"text":"I used to only come here for drinks and always overlooked the menu since I always assumed it was just your usual fried snacks but I recently noticed there was actual food items here so decided to go for dinner the other night. I'm sad Henry's closed because I loved their pork chop and was very happy to see they served the same style pork chop and ordered that and my friend ordered the beef noodle soup. I was very pleased with the pork chop it was perfect and my friend enjoyed the soup. While I was leaving I grabbed a cold smoked chicken and spicy tendon for lunch the next day and those were also amazing. Definitely going to come back again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"This is the best place in AZ for boba. The boba is fresh and not hard. My favs are coconut slush and passion fruit slush."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I drive at least once a month from the far west valley. Great atmosphere, friendly employees. Nice place for family, as they have games and it is quiet. They also have Internet access which is nice when I'm there and I need to access it."}
{"text":"Boba tea here is pretty good for an Arizona boba tea shop. Customer service is just on the OK side. The cashier got my order wrong and was not at all apologetic about it. Instead, when I went to go pick up my tea, I was given a lecture about how I supposedly the one who got my order wrong. I always order the same thing at every boba shop and this is the first shop that has gotten my order wrong. As I mentioned, the boba is good but customer service goes a long way in this industry. A smile is all that is needed to please me and I did not see a single smile from the cashier, let alone a pleasant greeting. So, three stars for decent boba...minus two stars for not being as friendly as they could have been."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE FACT THAT THEY SELL LOLLICUP TEA HERE. It is so hard to find legit tea in the area so I was definitely in heaven when I discovered the lit up Lollicup sign. I love me some milk tea and popcorn chicken. Their popcorn chicken is not those tiny pieces one, they're actually big pieces of chicken like chicken tenders almost and they are DELICIOUS!!

One thing that bothered me was how inconsistent their prices were. The prices on the menu is different than the togo menu and the board - so it's like looking at 3 different price lists without knowing which one you're going to get charged lol

*free wifi
*plenty of seating
*minimum charge of $10 to use credit/debit cards"}
{"text":"This place has the usual fare of boba drinks. It has my favorite flavor of plum tea which is nice since it is not too sweet. I have gone a couple of times, purposely ordering a variety of drinks and foods and it has been pretty awesome. I also had the shaved ice with red bean and green bean dessert which comes in a bowl (I ordered it sans the condensed milk). The beans were well cooked and sweet enough without the condensed milk (for those of you who are lactose intolerant like me!). I'm going to try their hot grass jelly next time!

Some of you may think that this is just a boba place. It's not.  Their meals are reminiscent of the box lunches you can buy off of train stations in Taiwan. I'm glad I found a place where I can get Taiwanese home cooked food if I feel too lazy or am too busy to cook myself. My mom's food tastes a lot like this. I tried the Fried pork chop combo, beef roll, beef noodle soup, the fried tofu appetizer, and ground pork rice. All really good. I also like that their meals come with a stewed/soy sauce hard boiled egg and Taiwan style kimchi (cabbage). 

Best of all, the prices are really great. We ordered way more than we could eat and it came out to only $30. This is as close to Taiwan fast food as one can get. The place also passed my hygiene check. I like to eat in a place that is clean! 

If you are in a rush, they have these prepackaged cold dishes like seaweed salad, stewed and sliced bean curd with seaweed, he kimchi cabbage, etc. Hopefully this gives you an idea of what this nice little Asian cafe is like!"}
{"text":"Fun board games and good mango milk tea!"}
{"text":"My drink was not delivered to my table unlike other customers. They only serve their fellow countrymen. It was not even busy. I feel like I'm discriminated."}
{"text":"One of the few authentic boba in Arizona. A real tea house with real hours to eat hang out and play board games. Casual and quick if you're just looking for take out."}
{"text":"Second visit. First time for food. Last time we got drinks, and they were good.

Today we got beef soup and fried pork chops.  The soup was fine, but not nearly enough substance to it.  Mostly broth.  On the plus side it did taste very authentic (I've been to Taiwan, and this place seems to be Taiwanese).  The fried pork chops were very salty.  Not too much for me, but I wouldn't have wanted much more salt.  Flavor was fine, but nothing special.

Maybe we'll stick to boba and other drinks when we come here.  The food was OK, but there is better available elsewhere."}
{"text":"perfect boba milk tea (higher quality pearls with a brown sugar flavor) and fresh, crispy egg-rolls. They prefer cash, but you can still use your credit card for a small fee."}
{"text":"Got the minced meat over rice with was quite saucy and good if you like fatty food like me.  It comes with a hard boiled egg and a slice of pickled daikon to cut the richness of the sauce.  Wish the sauce was a little saltier and that the meal came with more pickles."}
{"text":"?????????LEE LEE??????????

{"text":"No, you're not dreaming. The reviews don't lie.

This place IS that good. Say \"yes\" to Yes Cafe if you're in the area (or even if you're not in the area - take a drive!) Whether you are thirsty or hungry, or both, this place has you covered. They have mastered their menu. Every single dish has come out flawless. This is by far one of my favorite restaurants to visit. The service is friendly, fast, and exact. The food is cooked fresh and arrives quickly.  

Be sure to pick up some cute hand-made artwork while you're there - you'll see what I mean after you order. Amazing work!"}
{"text":"Ms Manfan and her son Devin the cousin of Alanna are so nice and I'm a good friend  next time I'll order fried chicken steak combo for lunch and keep up the good work Ms Manfan and son Devin"}
{"text":"This was once Lollicup, it's still the exact same inside and still the best boba spot. Their Thai tea and milk tea are delicious."}
{"text":"Five stars for their boba, and then two stars deduction because their food is less than mediocre. Ordered the tofu, fried chicken cutlet, taiwanese egg waffle, egg rolls (they were spring rolls but on the menu it said egg rolls) and pork noodle (ramen i think). I have visited her a multiple times and my two cents is, dont order any of the fried stuff. I doubt they have a deep frier, as the food is air fried more than fried in oil. The chickens are stale, tofu and the spring rolls reeked with a weird smell. Although heir boba is surprisingly good with very strong scented tea. And unreasonably cheap. Probably the cheapest boba I've found. (At this moment I have bumped it up to a four star from three) anyways, i would always drop by whenever I'm in the area because it's half the price what I'd pay at the mall."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times.  Never remembering to take pics or check in.  What is wrong with me?  :)  I got my go to drink, Almond milk tea.  No bobas this time.  It was good but still on the sweet side.  I asked for 1/2 the sweetness, so not sure if I got that or not.  I don't think I did.  I need to come back to try the food.  Looks and smells good!"}
{"text":"I come to this cafe several times a month for a year. The food is really good. I recommend their fried chicken steak rice combo, sausage rice combo, fried squid balls, fresh fish tofu soup and almond milk tea."}
{"text":"The fact they have pudding as an option besides tapioca gets 5 stars from me.

You are probably wondering why would I give a business 5 stars for pudding???

If you are from the bay area you and enjoy pudding as an option for your drink besides tapioca and have lived out here long enough to know the struggle of not finding one decent tapioca having cafe that has pudding.  Until Now!!!!  
That only took 5 years for Arizona to catch up to California's status. 

Thank you jesus for this place I can live a little easier now until we move back!"}
{"text":"Get your boba drink here broh.
Not sure what to eat, I only recognize the egg rolls. I need a beginner menu."}
{"text":"One of the best places for Boba in the area. Not only do they have boba but they have pudding milk tea!

Boba was cooked perfectly and the pudding was delicious. The milk tea that I had there was delicious and the boba was soaked in honey and brown sugar I believe. 

The place used to be Lollicup but I think they got a lot better after switching and losing the franchise.

If you're looking for great tasting boba milk tea or even better, pudding milk tea, the Yes Cafe is hard to beat in the area."}
{"text":"Came here because boba tea house ran out of food... sigh. The popcorn chicken here is seasoned so they don't provide you with any dipping sauce. That's exactly what they told me when I asked for sauce. LOL. But it was so salty..and the pieces are huge, in a bad way. Not very popcorn-like. And calamari is really hard. Also salty. It was all weird. I probably would be more gracious with stars if they would have just given me some damn sauce."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being able to eat here and visit within for 2 weeks. 
The atmosphere is great within and everything was pretty clean.
The food here and boba are amazing. I had tried a variety of drinks while in town and out of what i tried the Kiwi boba and Passion Fruit are definitely my favorites! In any case all the drinks I tried were fresh tasting and for the most part tasty. I was able to try some of the food also. Lots of yummy stuff I admire the chef for she does what she loves, and she puts a lot of effort and heart into the food she makes. The Beef noodle bowl here is top notch and full of flavor~ If I was able to,  I'd rate this place more than 5 star.  So if you have not been here before I recommend checking it out and trying something new you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is our go to spot after church to grab some boba and play board games and chill. They used to be a Lolicup but I think it was more profitable to drop the franchise name. I like the boba here but it is a little bit more expensive than the competitor a couple of blocks away. 

The food is also pretty good. The squid balls are great as well as any of the noodle dishes."}
{"text":"I liked Lollicup, despite unprofessional service. Yes Cafe is better because of the more professional staff. Yes Cafe is my other go-to place for boba and is conveniently in my hometown of Chandler. My favorite dishes are the popcorn chicken and the beef soup. Their black milk tea tastes the way black milk tea is supposed to taste (not too sweet, but sweet enough to also taste the tea). A flavor I found particularly interesting is the Japanese Baked Green Milk Tea. I'm not sure what to make of it. Otherwise, I prefer this place's boba drinks over Boba Tea House down the street."}
{"text":"Yes Cafe has great boba selection and flavors. My only recommendation is fir them to kind of clean up the place. Too many toys and boardgames all over the place"}
{"text":"Only visited for the Boba Tea and pleasantly surprised to know it offered genuine Taiwanese home style casual meals! As far as Boba Tea, this is legit. Among the best we've tasted. We had regular milk tea, mango with boba tea, milk jasmine with boba tea and milk coconut with boba tea.  Their bobas are the real deal, cooked nice and soft as they should be, and the standard size which is served with the standard big boba straw.  The cups come in regular or large and are served sealed where u use the straw to punch the hole.  Now for all U boba tea fans out there this is not an Americanized mall courtyard ripoff.  This is the real deal.  Flavors are fresh and tasty, not over sweetened.  We are ranking this among the top we have had including from chinese places back east. Can't wait to go back to try the light casual meals now.  From what we've seen there and read about their food is going to be as delicious as their teas! Great gem of a find right here in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit here and I love this place so much already! The food and drink was super great, and authentic (Trust me, I'm from Taiwan), staffs are friendly and the price was pretty decent too! I'll definitely be coming back whenever I have a chance to visit Phoenix !"}
{"text":"Came here because of review.  Disappointing. I ordered the Taro milk tea with boba.  Got Taro milk tea with what looked like yellowish syrup that I couldn't pinpoint the flavor of.  The drink was probably one of the worst boba tea I've had in a while.  There was very little ice to begin with which melted very quickly, leaving behind a luke warm beverage that was far from refreshing.  They didn't bother to mix the concoction thoroughly.  I could taste chunks of Taro power and powdered condensed milk... it was unpleasant and irritating.  I would have insisted on getting the correct drink, but was running late for a movie.  Their chicken was ok.  Just won't plan to visit here again."}
{"text":"Great boba! The tea is delicious and the boba itself is great. I always get the kumquat black tea with or regular boba milk tea, but there are many other great options. The cafe is really nice and cute."}
{"text":"Didnt feel like going home after seeing some xmas lights so decided to try a new boba place. Got the taro milk tea with lychee jelly and strawberry milk tea with mini boba.  It was okay here. Service is slow even tho there werent that many people in here. The cashier and the person making the orders seem confused and appeared to miscommunicate.  The taro milk tea was good but the strawberry milk tea was beyond gross!!! It was sour, didnt taste like milk tea or strawberry! It was watered down powdered strawberry gelatin flavoring.... I will likely not be coming back nor recommending this to anyone. Jt boba house in avondale is way better.  

Cant wait to go to CA for boba again."}
{"text":"Maybe the milk tea is overly sweet, but the food is pure nostalgia. 

If you long for simple comfort food of Taiwan, this place probably has a dish or two (or more) that will fit the bill.  One bite into the fried chicken steak, and I nearly teared up--I had forgotten how different American and Taiwanese fried chicken could be, and this was the perfect reminder.  

Five star is not a fair rating, but a tasty reminder of my childhood is an irresistible bribe.  

For those who have been away from Taiwan a long time, I'd say \"Yes, come visit this cafe if you are near by.\"  A very pleasant surprise find in Arizona."}
{"text":"Milk tea is pretty good and the price is way better than boba guys.  The squid balls are on point.  I would come back.  They are friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I have not tried the food here yet... When I do, I will update my review. I have tried their milk teas and green tea drinks and I must say that they're good. They are also cheaper than other boba places as well so that's a plus. It's a good hangout place too with board games and magazines. They also offer wifi for you to do work. The service here is good as well."}
{"text":"??  ?????????? ????????????????????????????????? ??????????"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place out but ended up not enjoying it as much as I'd hoped. 

The inside is cute but the lighting was very dim and made me feel more tired than excited to stay there.

The staff was nice. We ordered two drinks (Thai Milk Tea & Peach Black Tea with Boba) and the egg waffle. The Thai Milk Tea was bright orange in color and tasted like nothing but powder and sugar. The waffle was good.

Overall not really worth the trip to try it out. However, if I decide to visit again I'd like to try their food."}
{"text":"Most authentic tasting Taiwanese food in Arizona. Extremely delicious and generous  serving size. The staff is also incredibly friendly. Would recommend the boba milk tea, beef noodle soup and popcorn chicken.

If you and your friends need a chill place to hang out and/or do homework, yes cafe is definitely the place to go!! It's a great hang out spot with a variety of board games for you to play and let's not forget the free wifi!!"}
{"text":"i've been going here for ten years and no other milk tea will ever come close. my friends and i play board games here every week and have probably ordered the entire menu at this point. good stuff."}
{"text":"Such a great place for Boba and lunch. They have a huge selection of drinks available, and  toppings/add ins to choose from. They also have a food menu with small plates and snacks. Very affordable and great quality food and drinks! Quick tip: closed on Mondays, and will only accept card payment for  OVER 10$."}
{"text":"An impressive variety of bubble tea drinks (Hot and cold), and inexpensive, hearty dishes. How can you go wrong? Yes Cafe is a definite improvement over the previous Lollicup in many ways!

After looking through the extensive array of flavors offered for drinks (Fruity, coffee, or creamy/milk-based to name a few) I decided on a small hot almond milk tea with boba and had the popcorn chicken combo with rice ($6.50). I also tried some of the beef noodle soup. 

The almond milk tea had the perfect amount of almond flavor and was not super sweet which I greatly appreciated. The popcorn chicken was excellent. It was served with a soy sauce marinated egg, marinated tofu, pickled vegetables, cabbage, and a heaping mound of rice. The beef noodle soup was decent and had a lighter flavor than others I've tried.

Service was friendly (A big step up from when it was Lollicup!) and our drinks and food took only a short time to be made. 

I'll definitely be back to try more of their food and drinks! They also sell diamond ice (Korean style shaved ice AKA patbingsu) which I will have to try as well. :)

P.S. Credit card/debit allowed for purchases over $10."}
{"text":"Very delicious food here. I love the beef noodle soup or the ground pork noodle. The vanilla snow is very good."}
{"text":"The only place in Chandler to get real Taiwanese food. My favorite one are Fried Chicken and Fried Fish dishes. There is no other place that make the taste so original. 

Not to mention that the boba milk tea is just as good as you can get in Taiwan. The owners are very friendly your own family. It's clean and great place to hang out with friend over the weekend and a great place for quick business lunch. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for the place but the food turned out just okay.  Doubt I would be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I like it that unlike other boba tea places, they do serve drinks and food here. Food here isn't bad, I've tried a variety from pork chop rice platter to beef noodle soup, squid balls, fried kimchi tofu, pan fry vermicelli noodle, etc. Boba teas/smoothies ok. Would be better if they give more boba/grass jelly for the price you pay. I've been to other places where they give double the amount of boba & grass jelly. 

The one thing I especially dislike about this place is their minimum $10 charge to use credit card. Makes it a great inconvenience on customers who don't carry cash."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of lavender drinks, but the owner recommended it. She was true to her words and it tasted really good and didn't have an overabundance of the flowery taste."}
{"text":"I'm just saying \"Yes\" to life, cause' you gotta say \"Yes\" to life and in this cafe that is well named, \"Yes Cafe\"!

Inexpensive, combination of unique and classic milk teas, slushes and the like with typical Taiwanese and Chinese meals and snacks. I stopped in for a quick drink after dinner and got the Jasmine Green Tea with Boba and Egg Pudding. The milk tea was recommended by a lovely women, perhaps the owner, who made sure it wasn't too sweet. The drinks are pretty cheap, as they should be and only about $5 for a large sized drink with two toppings.

The boba was a bit overdone, though still a little chewy and sweet, the egg pudding is more on the jelly side and not as creamy but tasted good. The Jasmine Green Tea was surprisingly good, fresh tasting, tea flavor as one would expect and best of all not too sweet. Probably one of the best boba drinks I've had in Arizona in a while. I would say Yes Cafe and TeaStreet are the best and compare very similarly to that of milk teas in California, where bubble tea shops run rampant.

Great little mom and pop type boba shop. Tons of seating and games to play with friends, played a good game of Battleship although a bit sticky! They play popular Top 40s music that isn't too loud. Also props for closing at 11 p.m. on a Friday unlike the other boba shops that close early.

Saw that they have snacks and have been fiending for Popcorn chicken and it looks like this place definitely has them. I'll have to be back to try them out!

They take both cash and card here."}
{"text":"Here is the best as well as real style Taiwanese cuisine I have found so far.  Delicious, competitively priced and nice service. Besides, their boba tea are also tasty than any other place around Phoenix .. I recommend you guys here is exactly what you are  looking for a Taiwanese place.So I was pleased to be spending my money here. Even if here is kind of far away from where I lived, I come here quite often tho."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars!! Beef noodle soup was way above average...popcorn chicken was tasty but a little oily, the tofu fish soup made my wife from Taiwan say it reminded her of home!! The pig ear appetizer was tasty as well!! Solid little place in a shopping plaza"}
{"text":"Awesome Taiwanese boba place to get drinks and snacks. They also have the mini boba that I enjoy so much. Our drinks were made with the right amount of sweetness. Definitely gonna come back again!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I really enjoy the beef noodle soup, beef tendon and fried pork chop combo! I usually order one of the boba drinks while I'm here, different ones depending on my mood :) Cute little spot with home cooked like meals. If you in the neighborhood, you should check it out!"}
{"text":"Been driving by this place for almost 3 years now and never realized it was there. Decided to check it out and try out the dish that I've been dreaming off. The Pork Chop Combo Plate... 

The dish was on point, it really tasted like how my dad cooks it. The soysauce egg, pickled veggies, steam cabbage, tofu bring the dish to live and creates a really balanced meal with no hot sauce needed. The pork chop was delicious and full of flavor; not to mention a decent size for the total price. 

I also got milk tea with boba, also very good. It wasn't too sweet and the boba was sofa; not chewy just right. Very happy I found this place as it's hard to find good Taiwanese food in East Valley."}
{"text":"I suppose there isn't a ton of selection when it comes to Taiwanese food in AZ.  This place was pretty decent and definitely filled my craving for some Taiwanese.  Not the best I've had, but definitely one of the few solid choices we have out here if you need something to hold you over until your next trip to CA or some other state with a larger Taiwanese population..."}
{"text":"One of my fave place to eat. Always friendly and fast when it comes to ordering boba or food. Always so delish! You sit down at a table and they deliver the food to you right away. Love this place"}
{"text":"The price is very good. I just ordered two main purse from other Chinese place and it cost me $25; I have order total 5 items from Yes Cafe and tie total cost is $ 33.+... I will come back here."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The staff is friendly and the snacks/food and drinks are yummy!! It used to be open til 11 but now at 930. I def recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here with the girlfriend while trying out different Asian eateries in the area. We ordered the lu rou fan (ground pork over rice), beef noodle soup, and jasmine milk tea. 

The lu rou fan was pretty good and included a tea egg. It would have been better with mustard greens which comes standard in most other Taiwanese places, but can't really complain much. The sauce was great with the rice and meat all mixed in. 

The milk tea was actually really good. Probably top 5 that I've had - and I've been to TONS of bubble tea places from NYC Chinatown to Bay Area and everywhere in between. It had loads of tea flavor that you simply don't get when you go to the cheap places that only use the powdered stuff.

Now to the beef noodle soup - it was OK, nothing that special. The noodles tasted like it was prepackaged and didn't have the chewy goodness that you get with fresh hand-pulled noodles. Meat was decent, but I would have loved to see tendons, etc. 

Overall, this place was pretty good. From the small sample size that we had, I would slightly give the edge to Taiwan Food Express for the food. However, the service here is better and the owner was super nice. She reminded me of any of my typical Taiwanese friends' moms from back home."}

It's been a minute since I've been here.  Like, so long that I didn't even realize they had a minimum to use your debit card.  So let me take the time out and thank Lord Fugu, Adam A., for buying me my drink and not having me count some quarters at the register.  :x  Thanks, Adam!

I had a Royal Milk Tea with Pudding.  It was pretty standard and run-of-the-mill and the pudding was sweet and smooth.  It's nothing I can't find at a more favored boba shop closer to home.  I did manage to swipe an egg puff from Karen W.'s egg waffle and that was pretty fantastic.  It was a dense memory foam pillow [sounds so delicious, right?] that tasted like Chinese steamed egg sponge cake [Ji Dan Gao ???].  I like the more airy kind of egg puff but this hit the spot!  I can see myself ordering these puffs again!

All in all, Yes Cafe is a decent spot with free wi-fi and a wide variety of food and drinks.  I wouldn't mind stopping in but I wouldn't go out of my way --- especially with the $10 minimum to use your debit/credit card!  [insert heartbreak emoji]"}
{"text":"It has been quite some time since I've been here and I believe it is now under new management. The reason I re-visited this location was because they have recently started selling the egg dessert that I loved dearly when I was a child. My friends and I came here for dinner last week to try new food and catch up. Before they arrived, I ordered the Taiwanese sausages as an appetizer to hold out my stomach. I wish they would have put some garlic in it like what I am used to. It just tastes ok. When my friends arrived, we ordered the beef noodle soup and the pork belly with rice for main entrees and the almond milk tea with pudding for drink. The almond milk tea was tasty but definitely overly sweet. The beef noodle soup \"looks\" great but the broth was a bit blend. I took one bite and couldn't really eat the rest of it. My Pork Belly with rice was pretty good. I didn't care for the side dishes that came with it, but the pork belly was definitely well seasoned and marinated. I will probably order that dish again. The highlight of my night was to have that egg dessert they recently have on their menu. It took them about 15 minutes to make it and it was definitely worth the wait. 

Overall, I am not impressed with dinner menu but will come back and try different drinks. No doubt I'll be back for my egg dessert for sure."}
