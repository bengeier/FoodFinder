{"text":"I went to grab some breakfast from this place since I was in the area.  Got a western omelette with coffee for $8.  Not bad price.

However, the Western itself was very average.  Not bad, but not really good either.  The Irish cream coffee was terrible though.

Also while the service wasn't bad, the girls didn't say much and didn't explain the ordering system, so it was a bit of a letdown.  

However, it is 2.5/5 and I'll round to 3 since this is the first review"}
{"text":"Nice side addition to starskys. 
LATTE is good, if u like baked goods, all looks good. 
Interior is nothing amazing."}
{"text":"This small café is attached to Starsky's European grocery store. They have a strict rule that no food from Starsky's can be taken into the café.

We often stop in here for their delicious cappuccinos.  They use a little chocolate syrup to make pretty patterns on top of the drinks and will make them extra-hot if requested.  

Although you have to order and pay at the counter, the staff always bring the food to the table.

My sister absolutely goes crazy for their pierogies with sour cream. My son loves their cabbage rolls.

They also have a selection of herbal teas and other hot drinks.

The café is always clean and well-kept."}
{"text":"I'll rate this a \"4 stars\" because it feels so comfortable. My wife and I often shop at Starsky's and with our European background know this type of cafe. It is rather workman like, no pretensions, just generous portions and solid food. I can recommend the cakes and other desserts, all are delicious, but unless you like \"large\" you may easily share a single piece with your partner. Their regular coffee is good but not gourmet. The expresso bar is excellent."}
