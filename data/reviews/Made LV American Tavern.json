{"text":"This place is adorable. I love coming here for lunch. Nice hipster atmosphere, very relaxed. Some owners as honeysalt and buddy v's. Service is decent. Ordered their poutine for an appetizer, needs more gravy, but is tasty. Both times I've been here I ordered the burger. The bread is soft and sweet and the meat is juicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! I REPEAT, STAY AWAY! My husband and I went there for happy hour yesterday as they claimed to have a great happy hour menu, arcade games and fun atmosphere. BIG MISTAKE. The hostess was clueless with no personality and didn't have a brain to suggest where we should sit, so we walked ourselves to the bar. The entire place smelled overpoweringly like bacon (some might like that, I was turned off by it). Bartender was friendly enough and offered to give us samples of their draft beer as we perused the happy hour menu. I requested to sample two of the happy hour drafts and she poured one that wasn't on the happy hour menu. She didnt tell me it wasn't \"happy\" so I had NO IDEA that I was drinking a $9 beer until we got the bill!! Really???
We specifically looked at the happy hour menu, specifically requested samples of happy hour beer and she slips us a way overpriced beer instead. 
The happy hour menu also pretty lame, we didn't even order any food as none of it appealed to us. We think of ourselves as very open people, but this was a horrible experience. Oh, and to top it off, their \"arcade games\" are actually used board games (Sorry, Jenga, Monopoly). 
Bad decision as we will NEVER come back. We will go across the street to Brio for better atmosphere, better pricing and better food."}
{"text":"Good drinks, nice deals during Happy Hour, Renee was a great bartender. Will be going back."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and were not impressed.  The service was very good, but the food was a dissapointment.  My husband and I wanted to start by splitting a salad.  The waitress said it was not a problem, but when they brought it is was on one plate and was not even enough for one person.  We ordered hamburgers for meal, but again, they were hardly bigger than a normal slider.  Bottom line, way overpriced for what you get.  We will not go back"}
{"text":"Can I just say SUPER yummy food. We tasted the nachos, artichoke, dirty mac, chicken bbq, and s'mores nachos. Our server was SUPER engaging. Service was excellent, once it slowed a bit. It was a little shaky at first waiting awhile for our drinks. Agree with other reviews - SUPER noisy. The room in the back is disconnected to the rest of the restaurant, and my preference is always to be in the mix. So seating bummed me a bit, but I'll come back with a smaller group to enjoy delicious menu. Price points were very palatable."}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed with the corned beef hash. It was unique as the beef was shredded. And the house made hollandaise was delicious on both the corned beef and the Benedict. Of course we had to get the unlimited mimosas and they were a solid ratio of champagne and OJ. Boy did they flow freely. We had to get the s'mores nachos and they made me feel like a kid again. So messy and tasty! Our waiter Jeff was so attentive and kind. He really made our dining experience special. My only complaint was the music was pretty loud, but that's easily fixable."}
{"text":"We have been here many times. Food is delicious... Mac and Cheese,  forget about it!! Brunch is great! Bottomless is definitely on point! Heck and they have great bacon (p.s. Just ask for a side,  they will take care of you) There is Live Music on Friday... And a great place to catch the games. Brad, the manager, is a class act, genuine, and very personable... Awesome Peepz!! Make it a point to stop by, no pretentiousness here!!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Visiting here and stopped in for lunch and sat on the patio. Had the pulled pork sandwich and it was wonderful. Very good food. Service on the patio was pretty poor. Our young waitress was slow, seem confused or not trained. She disappeared for long periods of time, would come to our table and forget items and leave again. She rarely came back to check on us. Great food ! Not good service and this was during week."}
{"text":"Excelente lugar para disfrutar una charla con amigos, personal muy amable y excelente comida"}
{"text":"Seriously love love love this place! Friendly staff, great food, and warm atmosphere. The chicken wings are some of the best I've ever had! Try the salt and vinegar ones, YUM. Their happy hour bites are awesome like the $6 burger Meister. I can't go and not have the deviled eggs! If you couldn't tell already, I'm a HUGE fan of this place. We come for times like football games, birthdays, dinner, happy hour or just when we feel like having a darn good time and eats."}
{"text":"Pulled Pork BBQ sandwich is delicious! Service was a bit slow at lunch but staff was friendly and quality was there. I'd like to go back for dinner and try a few different things. I love that they put the kids menu's inside books for the kids to read."}
{"text":"Oscar Meyer ham and a block of cheddar cheese should not be on a meat/cheese board. Where's the jamon serrano and prosciutto??
Cheddar biscuits were small, hard, and dry. 
Was going to order more food but didn't want more disappointment. 
I've been spoiled by better restaurants that charge the same prices with better quality. See Manhattan Beach Post. 
Good service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Brunch Sunday was awesome! The bacon cheese biscuits were ordered over and over again! The double cheese burger rocked it. Our service was awesome ! Manager checked on us twice! Great experience! A must stop when at Tivoli Village!"}
{"text":"I went here for a business lunch.  The service was great - no complaints.  However, the food was just ok - ordered the clams - not much flavor, nothing notable.  Also ordered the truffle cheese fondue with potato chips - great concept - I think there was a bit much salt - cheese was salty and potato chips were salty.  Pretty good."}
{"text":"Went in for late brunch/hapoy hour. I enjoyed their kale salad but not much for their ribs. I think the ribs are too tough. Wouldn't order it again. Their fries are fresh and not frozen. their spinach artichoke dip has the right flavor  but would prefer it with tortilla chips over a toast. Overall it wasa pleasnt experience."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and this is my first review. Honestly, I am not a huge fan of the menu and prices outside of happy hour are very high considering the caliber of food. The chips tasted like they were fried in old oil. I do like the atmosphere and location and wish the food was in line.  I will say the hummus plate was good. Otherwise, have a drink you know you like and go elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"We were here for lunch last weekend and the food and service were both excellent! It's been a long time since we've received such great service. We had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries and fish & chips. Both dishes were great but I think the pulled pork was our favorite. We will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"On vacation in Vegas at the moment and happened to be in the area visiting friends. Found this place on Yelp and enjoyed it that much I had to write a review. The food was absolutely delightful and the service from our experienced waiter Travis was brilliant. I had the KC Ribs and dirty mac. Just wow. Talk about smashing the ball out of the park! Ribs and cheese will never taste the same again for me. The general atmosphere was great, not snobby, just well balanced and casual. Here for another few weeks so i won't be missing up on a chance to go back for seconds. Thanks to all at Made LV."}
{"text":"First and foremost. Amazing customer service. The wait staff is perfection. Our server Jeff was very informative about the dishes. I had something off the brunch menu. Egg white frittata. My boyfriend had the double stack burger. Both great dishes. The meals came out quickly. And we moved into dessert. Smors!!!! I have nothing negative to say about this place. Great atmosphere, great food, great people. Will most defiantly be coming back, and bringing friends!! THANKS JEFF!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Matt was great! The food, service, and atmosphere is amazing!"}
{"text":"Got to see a live singer do some covers and one or two that I believe were her own foods not bad and the drinks were good .. Cool place to bring a friend or two for some drinks and appetizers"}
{"text":"My friends and I were super excited to try this place because its by the Honey Salt owners. I arrived a little before my friends and was greeted by a very nice server (can't remember his name.) Right away he took my drink order so I had something to do while I waited for my friends. We were seated outside which was a nice vibe. My biggest complaint with this place was the food. 

We started off with the nachos. Then for our entrees my friend and I both ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich and our other friend ordered  Chinese Chicken Salad.

The nachos were okay, they weren't anything that left me wanting to go back for. My friend and I both took our buns off the sandwich (we probably shouldn't be eating bread anyways, haha) because the bread was too dry to eat. Our other friend, who got the salad, sifted through her salad for the chicken and her Chinest CHICKEN Salad was chickenless. She asked the waiter and he brought her chicken out on a plate to put into the salad...no biggie. However, she didn't make a dent in the salad because the lettuce didn't seem fresh. 

I would love to come back and try other things and hopefully our experience will be better. I absolutley LOVE Tivoli so I can't wait to come back to Made LV and update this review with 5 stars...until then....\"A-OK.\""}
{"text":"Way overpriced!  Two for dinner a burger, fish tacos which equated to 3 fish sticks, chicken wings that were undercooked and had to be thrown away  & two soft drinks. Over 50.00... marginal atmosphere  and certainly not  worthy of price.  AVOID!"}
{"text":"This place sounded great & looked good when we came in... And that's where it ended. It took forever to get our appetizers of bacon cheddar biscuits and pretzel bites.  And when the table next to you is telling the waiter (1of2) that his whole table's meal was horrible - you order soup and hope for the best. Fish tacos for the husband - horrible & possibly gone bad. We are praying that he doesn't get food poisoning. And the bathroom was nasty. There were dust bunnies on the wall. This place feels like it's either just opened or its on its last leg.  Either way go across the street to Brio."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Not great.  The interior is a little cold, but service was prompt and friendly.  
I had the cheese biscuits which were good, and the burger.  The meat patty was very juicy and flavorful, but I didn't love the combo with the steak sauce and couldn't really taste the cheese.  The fries were very good.
The s'mores nachos were rather awful.  A mouthful of dry ingredients; graham cracker and oreo crumbs with a bit of marshmallow and almost no detectable chocolate.  I could see the chocolate shavings here and there, but it wasn't enough with regards to all of those graham crackers."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with the family, the eggs Benedict were delicious! Looks like a small portion but you leave full and completely satisfied. It came with potatoes (a good amount too) which were really good! Was a little disappointed they were out of French toast but it gives me a reason to come back again and try it! I've heard the happy hour is pretty good, I also plan on coming back and trying that. All in all it was a good meal!"}
{"text":"Went here for superbowl had an amazing time and great deal all you can eat that day. The food was delicious and made to order. The server was NOT friendly and complained the whole time. The hostess and manager were amazing and professional"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try out Made LV for dinner. We've been here for brunch in the past. 

I tried the grilled cheese and fries. The crust was very crunchy and required a lot of chewing just to get it down. The rest of the bread was toasted just right with a garlic butter. The cheese needed a little more kick and the sandwich overall needed more cheese. It tasted more like cheese toast.  I prefer a more hearty grilled cheese.

My boyfriend tried the double stack cheeseburger with fries cooked medium. The bread was soft and the burger flavorful. 

I'll come back to keep trying different items."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a restaurant like this for a long time! The price range varies from fairly inexpensive entrees to moderately priced entrees. We started with the dirty Mac and cheese, omg, so yummy and decadent! I ordered the burger and my boyfriend had the fish fry, both were delicious. Best burger I've had in a very long time. His fish fry was so good, the batter was perfectly crisped and nicely seasoned. We finished the meal off with the donut holes and the yummy dipping sauce that comes with. I could literally drink that sauce, so yummy. We also had to make some slightly strange modifications to our order due to dietary restrictions, and they were more than accommodating. All together the service and food were both great, we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Major yum. But a little history...
   I went with my friend C to Made LV with some trepidations. C had been to the sister restaurant Honey Salt and said the food was amazing but the service was lacking. We went to Made LV with some concern that the service would be lacking.
   Well, we needn't be so concerned. The staff was warm and friendly and our server was a bright young man with a generous smile. He made sure we were happy with everything. And were we!
   Both of us had had huge lunches so we weren't super hungry so we decided to go with apps and a salad. We ordered the smoked onion dip, the mac and cheese with pork ends and the truffled queso dip with a Caesar salad. The smoked onion dip was really lovely with a creamy base and the onion didn't slap me in the face which is nice. The truffled cheese dip was warm, silky and made me close my eyes to savor it. Both came with house made chips which were super yummy. The mac and cheese is just amazing with cheddary accents and a punch of smokiness. The peas lend sweetness and the pork bits give it some heft and tang. The Caesar salad was amazing. It wasn't overwhelming with any particular flavor which is a problem with Caesar salad dressings. The croutons are light, crunchy and amazing. They were really good with the salad but even better with the truffled cheese dip. A possibly switch out that would be great.
   If you're off at Tivoli shopping, do check out Made LV."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot!!!! Everything from the appetizers (the Wings and Cheesy Garlic Bread) to our entrees was fantastic. I had the Eggplant Sandwich with House Chips and my husband had the Double Stack Burger.  All of it was absolutely fantastic.  The most difficult thing about lunch was picking what to eat because everything on the menu looked absolutely scrumptious! I can't wait to go back and try the S'mores Nachos! 

The staff was quick and friendly and the place is really cool looking without giving the impression of 'trying too hard'. They even had some arcade video games in the back (including Asteroids -to my husband's delight!). 

We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant at Tivoli Village.  The atmosphere is cool, the kids really loved it, as their Kids menus are inside of a real story books (creative idea).  The server was a 10, I hate I don't remember his name.  It was a tad bit empty so he did have a little more time to tend to us (party of 7).  I cant say anything bad about the ribs, trout, biscuits, onion dip, BACON & EGGS, SALT & VINEGAR WINGS, man n cheese, onion rings, and salmon salad. My sister didn't care much for the BBQ chicken, but who orders BBQ chicken anyways these days?  The price is right I think for the area & portion size.  We also order all 3 desserts, (Banana Pudding, Chocolate Brownie with ice cream, and the infamous DONUTS WITH CARMEL DIPPING SAUCE. TOTAL TAP WAS $222 before a very worthy tip :) .... OH! DID I MENTION THE HAMHOCK NACHOS, they are the BOMB.COM"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with fun food.  Great crafted cocktails and classy beer selection.  We had fun playing the classic board games and cards. It felt like a catered house party."}
{"text":"Made LV serves overpriced, average food.  The fish plate comes with 3 tiny chunks of dry cod on a bed of warm frozen fries. Includes two tablespoons of slaw -$19. The warm burger is served with fries - very plain.  Be warned, draft beers $9 each.  Of course, you will gladly overlook all this because you are in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Ummmmm....let me say \"I expected more!\"
   The decor is really nice, casual, attention to detail with a great feel & in better weather the smaller outside patio could be a nice choice for cocktails. even tho we live in Henderson it's a really good location @ Tivoli Village with ez parking, valet IF you want~
    The menu is casual fare, which is fine~ lots of sandwiches pastrami, burgers & pulled pork (which was a little to spicy for my tastes, and the bun was pretty blah) served with sweet potato fries cooked to perfection. My husband has ribs which he loves and he found these OK, totally fine but hardly an A as reviewed in the newspaper.
    Large drink selection with beer, cocktails & wine. The cocktails as I recall were $10, which seem high to me....I did have a glass of Ravenswood which was also $10 for what appeared to be a 5oz pour, maybe????
    All in All, I prefer Honey Salt which I have been to Atleast 10x's and have NEVER been disappointed food wise!!! Each location has great decor so try Made LV (like their logo, By the way!)  and I feel confident Honey Salt will lure you back, before a return to Made LV.
    Sorry, I just expected more~ the food is OK, totally editable. Just wonder who they know @ the newspaper for such a \"glowing\" review....."}
{"text":"Six people in the restaurant- 10 TVs- and they sit us outside in the direct sun because the owner is not a Cowboys fan and refused to change the TVs.  We walked out.  Clearly struggling for business yet will not accommodate anyone. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure at dining at Made LV this past weekend after months of wanting to check it out. We had a bridal shower here for my sister-in-law and I was beyond impressed by the quality of their food/drinks and superior customer service. They had us tucked away in the back for privacy and turned down the music so that we could all mingle and talk. They helped me carry the flowers and move tables around to ensure that we had a great layout for the bridal shower.

We ordered a few drinks and sampled a couple of their wines. I loved the moscow mule made with jameson. Not a big fan of whiskey, but my mom happened to order it thinking it had vodka in it. I was very impressed with the drink, which was not overly scented with whisky which is my main complaint about whiskey in general. I also tried the cherry tart pinot, sauvinon blanc and they let us order a couple bottles of champagne even though the menu states that you can only order it by the glass.

For food, we ordered several appetizers, including the edamame, pretzel bites, cheese fondue, and hummus plate. The edamame was fine, it was flavored with todashi spices and felt like it could have used a little more. The pretzel bites and cheese fondue were my favorite. The sauces that came with the pretzel bites were awesome and the cheese fondue with homemade potatoe chips was interesting and tasty. The hummus was good, but needed to include more pita bread and veggies for dipping. We asked for more and they gladly brought it to us. 

We played some games and they did not rush us or anything and constantly were checking up on us to see if we needed anything. Desert came later on, which was of course my favorite part! There were some sugar and maybe cinnamon covered donut holes with a jam dipping sauce which was fantastic! My favorite thing we had all night. We also had s'mores nachos which tasted as good as they sound. Instead of tortilla chips, there were graham crackers-so so good. 

All in all, it was a great event with major credit goes to the hostess of the event for finding Made LV. Props to Gatsby (yes that is her real name-amazing!!), who was so pleasant and attentive. We had a great time and can't wait to go back and try the lunch and dinner menu!"}
{"text":"First time there and the last time. I would call this a combination of hipster bar and sports bar, more hipster less sports. For being called \"Made LV\" there were no local beers on tap or in bottles. They have Bad Beat everywhere, but no beers. It took 15 minutes to get service with a half empty place. There was live music playing while game 6 of the ALCS was on and never attempted to turn off the music. The grilled cheese sandwich had way too much going on, couldn't accept the different flavors together. We can say that we tried the place because it's close to home."}
{"text":"I had a great experience dining here tonight in celebration of a friend's birthday. They were very accommodating with our larger party, and the service was great...the chef even came by to greet us during the meal!

All the food was delicious- our group shared. My favorites were the Dirty Mac n Cheese and Banana Pudding! Wow! 

I was so excited to try the Poutine...it was delicious, but I'm going to have it with bacon next time...oooh, I can taste that goodness now! 

Great location as well...in the Tivoli Village shopping center. Environment inside had a cool modern rustic vibe, and I even spotted a couple vintage arcade machines in the back. Cool!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Made last night for a drink and ended up spending 2+ hours there! We started off with the deviled eggs and baked artichokes, then moved onto a massive (and impressive) cheese board, then rounded out the evening with a bag of donut holes and banana pudding. Like I said, this was supposed to be a 'we have 30 mins to kill lets grab a glass of wine' but ended up being such a nice evening and meal. The ambiance of this new restaurant is so great. Dark enough to be relaxing but not to where you can't see the menus. The staff was incredibly friendly, attentive, and fast. I can't wait to go back and try pretty much everything else on the menu, and snack on more of those donut holes!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and food tastes great and service has been good! Bacon cheddar biscuits are amazing!"}
{"text":"The beginning of our visit was pretty rough, but it ended well due to staff and management really stepping things up.

I read fantastic reviews about their burger, and after coming off a long work weekend in LA I just wanted to eat and enjoy. We ordered appetizers to start:

-Dirty Mac & Cheese
-Smoked Onion Dip

The onion dip was tasty but the dirty mac & cheese seemed almost like a dip itself. The consistency was really runny...and then we realized, there weren't any macaroni noodles in it. At all. So we asked the waitress if there were supposed to be noodles in the mac & cheese, she took one look and declared, \"that does not look right at all!\" She took it and told us she would put in an order for a new one. 

In the meantime we decided to put in our entree orders and sadly, they were out of the burger :( I was so sad because I was craving a burger, but since we were seated and had just ordered appetizers (with a new mac & cheese on the way) we felt invested to stay.

We ordered the smoked trout and the pulled bbq pork sandwich. By this point, I was tired and grumpy (and sorely disappointing that my burger craving wasn't going to be satisfied) but the food was delicious and the correct mac & cheese tasted great.

Staff was very apologetic and not only did they take the mac & cheese off our bill, but also sent us out complimentary donuts at the end of the meal. Thanks for making best efforts to please us :)"}
{"text":"Made LV is a bit traditional, modern interpretation of American cuisine.

We ordered those usual suspects and a little twist.

- Black mission figs
- Dirty mac and cheese
- Smoked KC style BBQ ribs

Black mission figs scored the 4-star flag for us. Its delicate presentation was impressive. The BBQ ribs were done just right, the fries were done just right, the slaw was done just right. The portion of the mac and cheese was perfect.

Tivoli Village is becoming really competitive with all those great restaurants. It's great for diners for sure..."}
{"text":"First time here today & absolutely loved it! My waiter was so sweet & the gentleman, Jeff was helpful and hilarious! I always love a good laugh & yummy food :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. Had guests from out of town so we thought we should try someplace new. I have a 5 month old baby, I brought a stroller in bc I knew he would fall asleep. When I first walked in I thought this wasn't going to work. I couldn't bring the stroller with me. I left my stroller at the hostess desk, and was sat. The hostess went above and beyond, she brought our stroller threw the back entry way!! The manager immediately asked if we were comfortable and if we needed anything else. They had a dj there who was so polite and told us when he was about to play music, bc he noticed we had a sleeping baby. I just thought everyone was so nice and caring for our little baby. We order wings and hummus to start AMAZING!!! My favorite wings, I'm not sure how they were prepared but wow! I ordered fish tacos, they were delicious. We will def be coming back!! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Nice hipster place with imaginative food. However, not what I expected, price, food or service wise. I ordered the salmon and mom ordered a burger. I should have got the burger, it was fab. I didn't realize I was ordering a dismantled lox bagel. I thought I was ordering a grilled salmon. I also order a deviled egg appetizer and there was seriously one egg cut in half on the plate with one piece of bread, duck sauce and other stuff for decoration. Such a let down and rip off. While I was surrounded by my best friends I enjoyed them instead of my meal. The waitress was rude with a bad attitude and would walk away from you in the middle of your sentence. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice decor all around with a beautiful patio area. 

We came in for happy hour and sat around a very busy bar. The tables were almost on top of each other and it felt like it was one big party. This would have been cool but the large group behind me was all senior citizens who were shouting extra loud. This part wasn't exactly fun as my high top chair was being bumped every few mins as they got up to socialize. 

The bar area is fairly small but I have to give this place credit for very cool decor. It's comfortable and and I'm sure our experience would have been a lot better if we didn't choose the bar this evening.

The HH menu is ok. We chose the smoked
onion dip that came with salty house chips which were very good. Next we ordered the chopped chicken liver because one of the parties next to us told us we had to get it. Again these folks weren't invited but we were sitting on top of each other so it was mandatory to be friends. I hated this one and not sure what I was thinking as I'm not a liver kind of girl. We also tried the ham & cheese board which was great. I'm a sucker for cheese!!!!! We also tried a burger and it was very good. A simple burger with lots of flavor. Lastly came dessert and we ordered the bag of donut holes with salted caramel sauce that I could have eaten off of anything! We also had a few beers and margaritas. I was impressed by the sampling of their beers if you weren't familiar with something, very cool touch!

Overall food was great, decor was very cool, service was great until the very end but the cramming in the bar sucked. 

When our bill came at the end we noticed we didn't receive any happy hour prices which sucked because we specifically came in for that and ordered off the HH menu. We didn't bring it up because at this point it was getting too claustrophobic and we just wanted some fresh air."}
{"text":"I hesitate to write a review on this amazing gem because I would hate if it was too busy to get a seat. However, if your taste buds are in need of some cheering up, or craving for something heavenly, go here now. The food is incredible, the drinks are spot on, and the service is impeccable. Try the Breakfast burger. Your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Overall, this was kind of a letdown for me. Off to a poor start by calling in my lunch takeout and waiting half an hour for it- eventually the manager asked if I was doing okay, and my packed order had been sitting behind the bar for who knows how long. There were only four tables seated, and two additional employees present. Seems odd that they couldn't keep up with that.

Service issues aside, the food was underwhelming.
They offer a $14 half-sando, half-soup lunch combo with chips and a \"dessert\". The eggplant pastrami sandwich looked impressive but had an overwhelming peppery taste to it, as if that's the only thing it was seasoned with. The tomato and mozzarella salad was a miniscule portion, but good flavor: one slice of mozz chopped into quarters and half a tomato. Chips were seasoned, dessert was a cookie from a Costco tray.
Just because I've heard so much about it, I added on an order of the dirty mac. This was decent- hearty, cheesy, and saucy. I'm not a fan of peas but they work in this version. That said, I detected no Ritz but the flavors were okay. Wasn't wowed.

Interior is nicely decorated, and I dig their chalkboard menus over the butcher area. The bar is simple, industrial-style, and they have some outdoor seating facing Alta. But when the service and food both fail to deliver, I'm unlikely to return. I may pop back in for their 4:00-6:00 HH one of these days though."}
{"text":"I would go to any restaurant Kim and Elizabeth have any part in.  I fell hard for Honey Salt and now Made is up there as a favorite.  I have brought many friends and no one has a single complaint about anything.  The happy hour menu is fabulous.  Their happy hour burger's only competition in the area is Flemming's and to me that says a TON!!!  Love the strong island tea and the s'mores nachos rock!"}
{"text":"Went for the happy hour, had an berry eddy or whatever cocktail and the burger meister. The burger was good but NOT worth the $6 price at all. Jack in the Box would have been more satisfying overall. The something eddy cocktail was mainly soda and utterly tasteless. Only one bartender seemed to give a damn about customer service, and the bar back did, but those two were on the ball. Probably used to picking up the slack.  Honestly I would have rather spent my money at McDonalds, at least the quantity of food would have justified the $11."}
{"text":"Went to the Brio, was packed, long wait so we walked across the street to Made LV.  We were greeted by a super nice hostess/waitress and were seated.  Asked if we could go into the back dining area and she said no, they dont use that area.  She gave us all menus and recommended that we DO NOT order certain items as she said that they are always sent back.  Upon viewing the menu, not one of the 4 of us found anything that seemed appealing and we left and went next door to a butcher type restaurant and ate.  The place was packed.  So in short, was not impressed with the menu at Made LV at all.  The one staff member we met was really nice and accommodating.  My recommendation is to have a menu that is a typical bar menu or something that people would like to eat.  Maybe that is why all the restaurants around this one were jammed and Made LV was empty.  The second star was for the staff member who helped us.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Nice place down at Tivoli village.  Food was flavorful and presented nicely.  Chicken taco were good as were the nachos.  Garlic pepper wing were my least favorite but that my flavor profile.  Will be back to try their brunch."}
{"text":"Unbelievable comfort food great drinks everyone here cares and you can tell. The gm walks the floor and makes sure the guests are enjoying them selves! Great atmosphere as well. Felt at home with an upscale vibe. Will be back for the hospitality"}
{"text":"Patio seating is very nice & relaxing, although the center fire pit isn't roomy enough for long legs like mine. Dirty mac n cheese was rich & creamy, the peas were a good addition. Cocktails were unique & interesting, Bernie Lomax was my choice & didn't disappoint. When the burger came out, the smell was powerfully meaty and literally mouth-watering. It was juicy, with a perfect medium pink center in both patties, and yummy melty cheese. Turkey sandwich was solid, but paled in comparison to that burger. I'm still mentally drooling over it. Brook trout had a crispy seasoned skin that I ate all of. S'mores nachos were decadently delicious. When I arrived and when I left, (Thursday 9/11) there was a weird fishy smell inside that made me glad I was sitting outside. Minus 1 star for that."}
{"text":"We went to Tivoli for dinner and stumbled upon this place. Petty sweet spot with lots of TV's to view some sports events.  Started off with a couple drinks. I had the Bernie Lomax it was great. We didn't order any entrees we just ate the small bite plates. Had the figs there were just amazing. Tried the Loaded Mac and cheese which was to die for.  Also had there version of bacon and eggs which was another great dish. We had great service and great fresh food. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"The food- 4.5 stars
The ambiance- 3.5 stars
The service- 2 stars

Service was definitely what took this down to a 3 star review. Things started off so well, too! Made is in a great location in Tivoli Village in Summerlin. When we arrived, we realized that I'd made the reservation (for a large party, at that) for Saturday instead of Sunday. EEEK!!! However, we must have arrived at just the right time, because they were able to seat us right away. Score!

Once we were seated, we promptly got water, and the server took our drink orders. And then we waited. And waited. The server finally came back around after we beckoned him to take our orders. In his defense (for this), he thought we were waiting on one other person, but I think he should have asked instead of just letting us sit there.

The restaurant is very rustic-chic, and they have a really fun and interesting menu, including their cocktail menu. The only issue is the volume of the music. LOUD! It was really hard to carry on a conversation over it. The musical selections were fine- it was just the volume was too loud. I think that someone must have complained, because they did turn it down a bit right at the end of our meal.

The food, however, was great! We started with the cheese and bacon biscuits, which were served with salted honey butter. YUM! If you like Red Lobster's cheddar biscuits, these blow them completely out of the water! I had the poutine with ham ($9.95 +$2 extra for ham), and it was delicious. I did feel as though I needed ketchup, though. The rest of our party also enjoyed their meal- the hot dog & fries (the hot dog is served on Texas toast, yum!), the BBQ sandwich with sweet potato fries, and the ham selection. Prices ranged from around $10- $30.

I noticed that no one checked on us to see if the food was okay, but our water and iced tea was refilled constantly. After we finished eating, although our plates were removed promptly, it took a very long time for us to receive our bill, and an even longer time for our server to take the money. It was a very noticeable delay- we flagged our server down several times, but he still didn't come over to us. I'm not sure if he was just overworked, and short staffed, but it became pretty frustrating. 

All in all, the food was good enough for me to return, and I hope that they work out the bugs in service soon!"}
{"text":"The food here was very good! I would have gave 5 stars if it wasn't for the service. For a party of 14, they stuck us in the corner back part of the restaurant which was fine because we had the space to ourselves but they only had one waiter serving us, that meant service took very long. Our waiter was very nice and catered to our needs but you would expect more help for a big party. I was very happy with the food though. Their appetizers were yummy!! 

Dirty Mac & Cheese B+ 
Salt & vinegar chicken wings A+++
Deviled eggs A-"}
{"text":"Comfort food that is at least as tasty as it is fattening. Sorry to kill the mass agreement amongst you other Yelpers that the Dirty Mac n Cheese is the best thing since cinnamon swirl bread, but I thought it was good, not great. The Smoked Ham Hock Nachos were pretty close to phenomenal. My dad ordered the WAGYU Skirt Steak which he found to be outstanding. We also ordered the Donut Holes with raspberry dipping sauce- again, not bad but not great. 

They should rethink the seating. We sat at one of the large booths before the hosting station so we were pretty much sitting in the lobby. It's kind of uncomfortable to have parties consistently shuffling by. Micah was a wonderful server!"}
{"text":"Love love love this down home place. It's hard to find a place where 'people know your name' in Vegas. Micah is amazing. Get the deviled eggs."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight, and will definitely return.

The vibe/ambience/decor are slightly upscale, but maintain that local tavern/bar feel. Super welcoming, but by no means dive. 

And the food! Holy hell! 

Tried the buffalo cauliflower, chicken wings, burger and pulled pork BBQ sandwich, and they were all astounding. They brine, smoke and then flash fry the wings, and you can taste every step with each bite. Outright amazing. 

Super excited to try the new menu items, since they update the menu often. 

To top it all off, our server Sierra was absolutely astounding. Friendly, helpful, honest about menu and drink options and above all, not pushy but still attendant. Didn't want for anything or ever run out of water, but I didn't feel like she was hovering around us."}
{"text":"If i could give half stars, would be a 3.5.

Great service. Food, ok, nothing wow.

The dirty mac & cheese was tasty, but could have used a little more burnt ends. The pulled pork sandwich was good, the ribs, could have used some more time in the smoker: add some more smokiness and get a bit more tender. The hot donut holes were a nice finish."}
{"text":"I was hopeful after all the positive reviews, but I was extremely disappointed! Our server was nice enough but seemed out of it and made mistakes on our order 3 separate times. She hardly checked back to see if everything was okay. One item was poor quality and inedible, and while they did comp us the manager didn't bother to stop by and check in, and we noticed other staff staring at us the rest of the night. After this our service was slow (20+ minutes to tab out) and minimally polite. Makes me sad!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very casual atmosphere. Started with the roasted artichoke and fresh oysters as appetizers. Both were good and the oysters were fabulous. For entree I had the clams and my wife had two more appetizers, the wings and deviled eggs. Seriously the deviled eggs are addictive, very very good. The clams, kind of a clam boil with corn, potato and chorizo sausage was very good but he chorizo a little on the salty side. Donut holes with salty caramel dip for dessert. Clearly going to be a hit restaurant for the west side. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So delicious. I had the Burger, which was one of the best I have ever had. We also ordered the Salmon, which was delicious and perfectly cooked. For Appetizers we had the wings- wont be re ordering those. The Dirty mac was life changing, SO YUMMY. Chunks of Pork in the Mac and Cheese, absolutely delicious. The Steamed clams w the chorizo sausage was Epic as well.

Great Vibe, great food and great service. I will definitely be back,"}
{"text":"The owners of Honey Salt & now Made LV have what it takes to be successful, staple local restaurateurs... & I'm not even one of their fanatics. I dig the decor & energy of Made LV but hate the entrance/host area. Our waiter (Dave?) was one of the best waiters I've ever had- personable without overstepping & had personality. As weird as it is to criticize this, I did not like their glasses! Too short, too wide, too heavy... requires more refills, which was the one place where our service was lacking. Plus, the only straw that fits is a cocktail straw. Talking to others, prior to going to Made LV, & once we reviewed the menu ourselves, we agreed that it's a bit disappointing that there isn't more of a traditional bar/comfort food menu (with or without their spin on the items). We found it challenging to decide what to eat & wound up getting the same thing: pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was a good size- bigger than a slider, smaller than a burger- & plump with the pulled pork. The bun was also able to withstand the sauce of the filling but still soft. The pork was cooked well with a nice balance of flavor & a kick. The sandwich came with homestyle sweet pickles- after the sweetness of the sweet potato fries & the pork, the pickles were too much. A dill would have been a better offset. The fries were very good & cooked perfectly. Being a fan of Honey Salt's desserts, I wish I'd had room in my belly to try MLV's mini donuts or s'mores nachos. Fast forward a couple hours... I glanced around & noticed the place had pretty much cleared out so I said \"it's probably almost time to close, we should probably get outta here.\" A random employee was walking by & overheard then told us not to worry & to stay & enjoy ourselves. We only stayed a tad longer then headed out... outside, we looked at the time & the restaurant had indeed already closed. The fact that there was no hinting by staff to get the heck out speaks volumes about their service. It's the kind of service that'll take me back to a place with terrible glasses & limited menu options, any day, over a place with multiple appealing items & lackluster service."}
{"text":"I love this place!  My favorite is the Corn Beef Hash with the Bacon Cheddar Biscuits.  The service is spot on, my drinks are always full.  The manger Brad Kleiss always has a smile on his face and stops by to say hello.  I recommend you stop by if not for breakfast come by for a drink."}
{"text":"After looking over the menu online, my family decided that Made LV looked like a promising place to find a quick and interesting bite to eat. I did not take the time to read any other yelp reviews before taking the chance on this restaurant - whether or not that would have helped I can't say, but my experience at Made LV tonight turned out to be one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had. 
First off, the service was not even what I would consider satisfactory.*This is a good place to mention that the restaurant was not busy at all - there were only one or two other groups there.* While our waitress didn't necessarily go out of her way to be rude to us, she certainly did not make an effort to make us feel welcome either. I guess that's just it - she didn't really make and effort to do anything! She seemed really out of it and as a result she brought us an appetizer we didn't order (it turned out to be a tasty mistake so we didn't complain!), and brought my mom a salad with the wrong kind of dressing (a minor offense, but she actually mentioned that the mistake happened because she didn't even let the kitchen know what kind of dressing my mom had ordered). She rarely stopped to check on us and never offered drink refills. 
As far as food goes, it was by no means some of the worst I've had - three out of the four people in my party were satisfied with their meals, and the french fry portions were very generous - but the one food mess up was bad enough detract from what good there was! My dad ordered the pulled pork sandwich, expecting exactly that - a pulled pork sandwich - and instead got a weird sort of brisket like sandwich. The pork was cubed, not pulled, and was mostly fat. He respectfully mentioned it to our waitress so that she could let the kitchen know, and she responded that she would let her manager know. A few minutes later she came back to tell us that the manager had taken the sandwich off our tab, which we appreciated, but the manager never bothered to stop by our table to make an effort to show that he cared about customer satisfaction, even though we saw him take a break from socializing at the bar to walk past our table twice. Later in the meal, we noticed several people (including our waitress) pop their heads out of the kitchen to stare at us and whisper. Needless to say, we did not feel very welcome throughout the rest of our evening. To top it all off, it took 20 minutes just to get our tab. I so wanted to enjoy my Made LV experience, and am sad to say that I did not :("}
{"text":"This is a cool spot! The ham hock nachos at a great starter to share. I haven't had a bad sandwich or salad here either. Their mac & cheese is a great side... & I'm not typically a fan of mac & cheese.

I gave it a 3 because it's a bit pricey for what you get. But, a cool spot I'll go back to."}
{"text":"I've been to Made LV several times now and I'm a fan:  twice for lunch and once for brunch.  Everything was delicious, which isn't a surprise since it's owned by the same awesome chefs who operate Honey Salt (at the northwest corner of Rampart and Charleston), and the Anderiron Steakhouse (on the north end of Downtown Summerlin).  Each of these restaurants seems to have it's own unique menu, so you're not going to get the same taste buds tickled at the various locations.  Sitting in one the southeast corner of Tivoli Village, Made LV is easy to get to and easy to find.

Last time I was there for lunch I had the Lunch Box.  I opted for the Grilled Cheese (you get a selection of sandwiches to choose from) and Tomato Soup.  The time before that they were offering a special and it was too good to pass up:  a Wagu Skirt Steak Sandwich with Bleu Cheese crumbles, a Chimichura marinade and crispy onions.  So good...there aren't words to describe the food magic that was happening! 

The brunch is wonderful too.  I tried (and highly recommend) the Corned Beef Hash breakfast.  Cooked just right and It comes with sunny side up eggs on top.  My son had the Cap'n Crunch French Toast:  topped with a sprinkling of bacon pieces and the famous Cap'n Crunch serial served on top of the large, syrupy pieces of French Toast.

There's indoor and outdoor seating, with room for groups.  Inside is bigger than it looks with seating directly in front of you when you walk in, and the bar straight behind that.  Kind of hidden away and to the back left, there's even more seating.  If you prefer outside, there's covered seating with a cool chandelier tables, and even a small fire pit with seating around it.

As with all the businesses in Tivoli Village, there's tons of covered parking in the underground garage.  So park in comfort, then head upstairs to MadeLV to satisfy your culinary needs.  Oh, be sure to ask for Jeff.  He's a great waiter!"}
{"text":"That Barbecue Chicken.....OMG......You have to give it to them....Tivoli Village seems to have restaurants come and go but I hope this is a place that stays!!! The food is incredible and the staff is very attentive...I will return as often as my waistline allows!!!"}
{"text":"The service we had here was horrible! 
There was no other tables in the whole restaurant except for us, so you'd think we would get even better service, but that wasn't the case.
Firstly -- we asked how many tacos come in one order only because we wanted to share (my boyfriend and I) and they said 4 big ones. 
Secondly -- our friend ordered the border burger and asked for nothing spicy to be on it due to acid reflex.

When we got the food, the tacos were only 3 per order and they were way smaller then what she had made them out to be.
Then the border burger had everything spicy on it, she couldn't even eat it and lost her appetite because she got acid reflex and didn't feel good.
The other border burger our friend ordered still had the paper that the cheese comes off of in his burger, he even took a bite out of it and then he noticed.
Then two of us walked out on the porch because they said happy hour was for bar/porch area and we ordered our drink, and then went back inside to pay our other bill, when we received it, the burgers were still on the bill, and we had to wait 5-10 minutes for the manager to take it off -- even then he only took one off. So the burger that had the paper on it - we still had to pay for. 
We also had ants on our table and flies flying around constantly.  
Then as we were walking towards the hostess to ask her about something, our bartender we ordered drinks with, screamed across the restaurant and threw her hands up in the air and said 'Guys' and we were like oh we are coming to pay it, and then she nodded her head in disappointment  and tossed the check over the bar to my boyfriend with a dirty look on her face and we still even tipped. She never said thank you or even a smile. 
This was the WORST service I have EVER had. One thing after another, this restaurant needs to be looked into and needs new employees.

Teya - our bartender 

We can't remember our waitress's name but she kept rushing us for our tab because her work shift was about to be over, reminding us several times, and then when we asked for it to be split, she left and gave us a new waiter to do it.

HORRIBLE SERVICE. Never again."}
{"text":"Went to brunch here with a large group. Seated in the back where it was freezing! Service was good as it was able to handle the large group. Try the eggs benedict!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 6:30pm on a Friday night and it was a ghost town. 0 people at the bar and 1 other couple at a table besides ours. The music was blasting and we asked to turn it down as we were sitting right next to each other and could not hear a thing. I was a bit uncomfortable as the waiter was peddling cocktails and called me \"my man\" 4 to 5 times during the evening. My mother in law ordered the eggplant reuben which had to be sent back as it was inedible. I've never seen the skin left on and it was tough and could not bite through it. It took almost 20 minutes to get a replacement meal of very bland roast beef sandwich. I ordered the fish and chips (they said it was cod) but it had so much fried batter on it that it tasted like Mrs. Paul's fish sticks. For $18 I would expect more than 3 chicken nugget size pieces of fish and I told the manager so. My wife also ordered the roast beef and thank goodness for the dipping sauce because it was very dry. I had to flag our waiter over to get our check as he kept passing us when we had been clearly done for 15 minutes. You might think that they might comp a drink or something for the terrible food experience? But no ... they charged an extra $4 because the replacement meal was more expensive than the original one that was sent back. I will definitely not be back and that's too bad because I live less than 2 miles away from Tivoli and my wife and I frequent there often.

BTW/ Why are there pictures on other reviews that look like a professional took them? Seriously, who takes pictures of their food unless they are planning on reviewing them on yelp? Coincidentally they are mostly all 4 and 5 star reviews.... hmmm makes you wonder about shills?"}
{"text":"Wow, today was just not the day to be here. Today I took a friend for a birthday lunch, he arrived before I did and after not being greeted for a substantial amount of time ended up seating himself. There were only two other active tables in the restaurant and we could see a bartender, a server and a manager on duty. We ordered some iced tea while perusing the menu but had to flag the server down in order to put in an app - - the pretzel bites came fast enough and were soft and warm served with a spicy mustard sauce.  My friend ordered fish tacos which he said were OK although a very small portion. I ordered the lunchbox with eggplant sandwich & kale salad. The eggplant was mushy and tasted like an olive sandwich but the salad was OK. The chocolate cookie and milk were a nice touch but not enough to redeem the rest of the meal. Or third person ordered the breakfast burger and said it was very bland. We waited another 15 or 20 minutes for the server to come back and clear the table and bring the check. Just not a solid experience and I won't be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Cute cute cute! This place is pretty awesome. 

Went straight to the bar for Happy Hour(HH is from 4pm-6pm). Unfortunately there really wasn't anything too good on the HH menu so I just ordered from the regular menu.

Me and my friend got the Lunch Box which comes with half sandwich with either soup or salad. I got the roast beef sandwich with Caesar salad. The salad was the best Caesar salad I ever had in my entire life. I do not know what they put in that salad but I had to refrain from licking the bowl! It also came with dessert which was a chocolate cookie with milk which was the perfect completion to our meal. I wish I had another cookie! the roast beef sandwich was pretty good as well. It had a ton of meat and the bread was toasted perfectly. Also came with potato chips. 

I had questions about the wines and the bartender let me sample it before i bought it. That was appreciated. My friend settled with the pear cider which tasted like juice! Yum. 

Menu is pretty condensed. Not much on the menu but it looked promising. 

Overall, it was a great meal. The staff was attentive and the atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"What an interesting menu...so fun to order a lot of smaller plates and try different things. Our server, Siera was FABULOUS! It was my husband's birthday as well as another gentleman's in our party, she made the evening so special. She is so personable and took my shellfish allergy serisously (not everyone does...she said all the right things and checked back many times to ensure all was looked after while being prepared...that means so much!) The burger was amaaaaazing! We will be back and will ask for Siera!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, admittedly at quieter times in the day. On both occasions the food was excellent and the service was down to earth, thoughtful and friendly. The first time I had a spin on eggs Benedict for brunch, it was delicious, the hollandaise was about as good as I've ever eaten. Today we had the wings were juicy and had a hint of smoke flavor to them. Again some of the best I've had in Las Vegas. The flavor of the meat in itself was so good it felt wrong to put sauce on them. My wife had the fish tacos which I thought were on par with some of my favorite places (including south beach bar and grill in ocean beach in San Diego for those who've been there). I had the burger, it was cooked perfectly. No dried out meat here. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this new spot in Tivoli Sq. The food was SO GOOD!!
There were so many interesting things on the menu, we could not decide so we just ordered a bunch of stuff and family styled everything. Let me tell you, that is the way to go!

Food....The chicken wings were so moist and fresh! (not not frozen!), the eggs and bacon - Deviled eggs and pork bell - So good! Fig Salad- OMG YUM. You get the point. The food ROCKS!

Our service was excellent! The decor is very sexy, eclectic and rustic in a cool way. My ONLY complaint is it was SO CRAZY LOUD! The interior is wood floor, glass and a tin ceiling. All noise bouncing materials! When it was really busy, we were yelling across the table. With that said, would that stop me from going back? NO, the food is so fantastic, I will deal with a loud room, or maybe request the back area that seemed a little bit quieter."}
{"text":"I think if you come here for happy hour is good. We were here for brunch, the menu is very limited and no one was there."}
{"text":"Yo! MADE LV is amazing!!!

We started off w the blue cheese black truffle cheese dip w the homemade potato chips. Absolutely amazing. So bomb. 

Next we did Ceaser salad. It was def solid. 

For the main course we did the dirty mac and cheese and the BBQ pulled pork burger w fries. The Mac and cheese was beyond delicious, it had pieces of pork in it as well as peas for texture. Topped w a ritz cracker crust. The burger was one of best I've ever had. It's a must get!

For dessert we had the banana pudding. This was off the charts: fresh caramelized  banana, whipped cream, salted caramel sauce and tons of pudding. Next time we are going to get the s'mores. 

The drink menu is legit as well. We had iced tea and a Bangkok Mule, which was basically a Moscow Mule. 

This place is A+ 10/10 amazingness!!!!!! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So basically... I love their new menu!!! I was skeptical at first, mainly because my last experience was extremely underwhelming. However, after a strenuous cross fit work out... We opted to grab something light and relax. 

Please note... Monday nights are industry nights! 25 percent off to anyone working in the industry. Yay! 

We were sat and given water promptly. The menu has changed to include more vegan/vegetarian items! Whoo hoo big plus. We ordered the buffalo cauliflower, no cheese or ranch... Omg!!! The best buffalo cauliflower I've ever eaten. I'm planning on trying to recreate this in my own kitchen. The chili flakes and jalepenos were utter perfection, added into an already amazing dish! I also ordered the edamame. Large portion and it was seasoned to utter perfection. This is Another dish I would love to try to recreate! My friend ordered the Chinese chicken salad and said it was amazing. Again, another heaping portion! We each had a glass of wine and just enjoyed the ambiance of what has now become one of my new favorite spots. 

The service was great and everyone was extremely attentive. My food came out with cheeSe and they fixed it without dirty looks and seemed to be apologetic. Our waters never ran dry and they even boxed our food for us.

Overall this place went from 2.5 stars to 4 stars. Good job on the new menu selection and kudos to your staff for amazing service!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Re: Party of two, Tuesday, 2/9/15 @ 11:30 am.

The restaurant was vacant; the level of music quickly accelerated to point where conversation was difficult.

The Maitre'd willing lowered the volume somewhat but we still felt the need to move from the main room to the vestibule in order not to strain while talking.

The hard surfaces and no absorption in Made-LV make the sound bounce shrilly and unpleasantly, almost to the degree that one would find during evening hours in a bar or club.

The previous tenants of that building seem to have had the same sound challenge. We had hoped that Made-LV would have overcome the unfortunate acoustics which are further blighted by excessive volume.

However, kudos to our server, Gus, who was most agreeable and accommodating."}
{"text":"I recommend the burger from here. Full of flavor!! The burger also came with french fries in a paper bag and to my surprise the bag never got soggy from grease. They must bake them and somehow make them taste fried."}
{"text":"Not a very good meal. 

Overpriced to begin with. 

We ordered two different burgers, macaroni and cheese, roast beef dip sandwich and carnitas tacos. 

Top to bottom. 

Dirty mac and cheese.  4.5 stars.  Pretty delicious. 

Double burger with cheese, egg, grilled onions and bacon. 4 stars. 

Border burger. Cheeseburger with pepper jack, pickled jalapeños and avocado. 3 1/2 stars. Not as good as Five Guys according to our family burger expert. 

Beef dip. Had a great description and all the visual appeal and taste of a steakums sandwich straight from your grocery store freezer section.  Quite bad actually.  1 star. 

Carnitas tacos.  $12 for three of the smallest  tacos you could imagine with maybe an once and a half of dry and tasteless pork. Served with nothing. No rice. No beans. No salsa.  Pathetic.  Should have sent it back or called over the manager.  Zero stars or less.  

Overall, a pretty lame meal, but we did have good service and it was a beautiful night to sit outside and enjoy a night out with out teenage boys.  

Our fifth visit and likely our last with so many choices in Summerlin. Poor flavortown experience."}
{"text":"I ate here with my mom a couple months ago. They  took forever to get to us and there was barely anyone there. The food was okay but overpriced. These trendy gastropub places are getting pretty played out. It's basically an applebee's except they serve their food on a plank."}
{"text":"Nice place decent food. The place has a  unique menu and tends to be on the healthier side, which is why we go there occasionally. I really like the sliced turkey sandwich and salad I ordered. However my co-worker was disappointed in the lunch box lunch deal, first the salad was minuscule. Though we know the portions are on the small side, it was so tiny. She also wasn't a fan of the eggplant, it was overly salty and mushy. They also forgot the dessert that comes with the deal oops. It's a nice change for lunch places in the area when you're in the mood to splurge $$ for lunch. Again I did like my food but was not happy my hungry coworker was so dissatisfied."}
{"text":"This is one of the best new additions to the Las Vegas restaurant scene. This restaurant is off the strip and located in summerlin. Upon walking into the restaurant we were greeted by the friendly waitress. My he menu has an assortment of comfort food appetizers, tasty sandwiches, and dessert. The best appetizer was the truffle cheese potato chip dip. The creamy cheese sauce with slight hint of truffle was mouthwatering delicious. Another must have appetizer is the bacon and eggs. A nice thick slab of bacon along with some nicely cooked eggs.  For my main dish, I got the banh mi sandwich. It was so satisfying with thick pate and nicely cooked pork. We were blown away by the desserts: s'mores nachos and banana bread pudding. You must get both of theseA: simple yet addictive!! Yes the Las Vegas strip has a slew of amazing restaurants however there are some gems off the strip here. Come here now and often!"}
{"text":"First off, as we walked thru the door we were greeted by an extremely nice guy. Could have been the manager? 

It's a bar atmosphere, maybe not somewhere to take your first date, gents. 

We figured we'd try all the appetizers/small plates so we can try a little of everything. 
We ended up getting the dirty Mac and cheese which seems to be a popular item, as it should because it's far beyond your your standard Kraft Mac and cheese. Then we had the bacon and eggs. The thick cut bacon was to die for. The deviled eggs were so so, probably could have made them at home just as good. We then had the baked artichoke and I mean really, can you ever go wrong with baked artichoke? We topped everything off with the loaded s'mores nachos which was even more amazing than the real deal s'mores by the campfire. 

All in all, I will be returning. This is definitely a comfort food type of place."}
{"text":"Nice staff. Poor kitchen. Food was average at best. Also special requests were ignored. Burger medium rare came out well done and French toast with no bacon syrup was dripping with the syrup. 

They try to use presentation to justify the price. Also the water smells bad. Why does the water smell?"}
{"text":"Went here with my large family so we tried a lot.  The menu looks amazing, but we must have not ordered the right items, because they were not great.

The star for me was the smoked onion dip app.  We practically licked the jar out.

I had the bahn mi, and that just wasn't great.  We ordered the pate, chicken wings, pulled pork, and dirty Mac n cheese and all were just OK.

I want to go back, because their menu has so many items that look good, but hope to have a better experience next time."}
{"text":"I love this place. We found it my accident as we were sitting across the way at brio. We had such bad service at brio that we decided to go try their banana pudding. Omg!!!! It is to die for. We've been back several times just for that. Don't get me wrong we do come here for other stuff and have not been disappointed except for the mac and cheese. We didn't care for it. However if you are a die hard Mac and cheese fan you will probably like it. The artichoke is delicious too. This is one of our favorite places to go and we will always come back."}
{"text":"Feels like new restaurants are constantly popping up at Tivoli...but just not staying. I'm leery about forming any kind of attachment to this place...but non the less here is the review...

Really liked the decor of the place. It had a hip rustic feel to it. I noticed behind the hostess area there was a shelf filled with board games. If you want to play you can ask the host to pass you a board game. Very cute idea...but I don't know how functional this would be. The tables didn't seem like they were large enough to accommodate playing and eating. But VERY cute idea. They also had a couple of arcade games in the back. 

The menu. Where to start with the menu?? Visually it's really cute. It's on a massive wooden piece and has the feel of a clipboard. But the layout of the menu is awkward along with the names of the food and description. At a glance nothing is familiar. I ordered several things with my party and split it all. We ordered a Caesar salad, chicken wings, and the fish and chips. Salad was decent, wings were okay, and the fish and chips were okay as well. Nothing really memorable. 

After we were finished with the wings, our server placed hot water and two \"tablets\" on the table. We poured the water on the tablets and the tablets expanded into napkins. Very cute. 

Overall, I loved the decor. The food was meh. But I feel like this place has a lot of potential. Will I return? I'd give it a couple of more shots before its on my never-to-return-list."}
{"text":"The lunch menu has a variety of choices, appetizers, salads, sandwiches and entrees plus desserts. 
It was a beautiful day to enjoy the west patio which has a bounty of shade umbrellas. A small disappointment was no figs on the menu because they are out of season. Our server was friendly and helpful. Her assistant brought the water promptly after being seated. However he never returned to ask if we wanted a refill.

The BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich was tender and juicy. It was run down your hand juicy. The sandwich was piled high with BBQ and topped with coleslaw and 3 pickles on top of the toasted bun. This was great tasting BBQ with not much smoke. A visit to the wash room for hand washing was required at conclusion. The sandwich includes a container of sweet potato fries that was more than I could consume. However the fries were delicious. A container of mustard aioli is nice for dipping the fries and even sladdered on the sandwich bun.

The Nueske Hot Dog was not up to the Gold Standard (Windy City Dog). It was beer steamed, covered with sauerkraut and grain mustard. The Hot Dog comes with regular fries that were tender,  tasty and grease free.

Made LV  menu has many choices and I look forward to returning for more."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3 times and enjoy the atmosphere and mostly the happy hour and food.  I was skeptical since this location has had a few other restaurants previously.  Happy Hour was my first experience and the prices were fantastic.  The food and variety made me happy since we were with 7 people and everyone had different tastes.  Matt the bartender took great care of us, was attentive and we just had a wonderful time.  My favorite is the turkey sandwich with the salad.  The french fries are the best!    Thank you for being a great place to visit!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you about the worst brunch experience I've had in my life...
I decided to come to Made LV because I love the ambiance of Tivoli Village and I hadn't been yet. I saw they had moderately priced food and $20 endless mimosas so I was sold and decided to venture over this Sunday.
I arrived with a friend and my fiancé, my friend and I decided on the endless mimosas and my fiancé got a single Bloody Mary. Our server, Edward, told us they ran out of Bloody mix and could not accommodate his order. This obviously wasn't the servers fault so we shrugged it off and he brought us our mimosas. 
I ordered the breakfast tacos mostly because there was chorizo, the spice and texture would have gone well with the egg and toppings except for the fact they no longer had chorizo. Instead they were putting some sort of thick cut \"bacon\" in it which I regrettably said was fine, and placed my order.
My friend and I finish our mimosas and we're told that they ran out of champagne and had to order either the endless shandy or mojitos, which aren't even close to being brunch drinks. At this point I was fed up. The server could have told us when we ordered the endless mimosas that the champagne was running low and offered us an alternative, but no Edward just decided not to tell us. This again wasn't his fault that it ran out, it's managements fault. What type of management screws up on inventory so badly they run out of ingredients to make Bloody's and Mimosas at 1 p.m on a SUNDAY during brunch when they offer BOTTOMLESS??? Absolutely unacceptable.
My friend and I switch to bottomless Mojitos since we had to get bottomless SOMETHING, and the mojitos weren't bad, I just don't come to brunch for Mojitos. Then the food was brought out. My tacos were the most depressing dish I've had in recent memory. The tacos themselves were overloaded for the small corn tortillas provided. The eggs were bland and watery, the \"bacon\" on top tasted like diced ham but had all the fat of bacon, but since it was thick it was chewy and unpleasant to eat. I only ate one taco out of the three it was that bad. There was really no flavor to them at all.
Every time we wanted another mojito we had to ASK for it, which kind of takes away the point of having something bottomless if we continually have to ask for refills. Once we finished our last mojito it took about twenty minutes for our server to even get us the bill and pay for our meal. While we were waiting for our server to ask us if we needed the bill, as if our empty drinks and cleared plates weren't enough of an indication, we looked over and saw him lying with his head on the bar. Our server, Edward, was taking a nap instead of taking our credit cards. If I had no moral compass I would have walked out without paying. 
The restaurant was empty except for two other tables, there was no excuse for it to take our server that long to get us our bill, or for us to have to ask for refills on our \"bottomless\" drinks. The food was bad and the service was worse. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE, it's not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"Came here for the 3rd time.  I want to like this place.  I love Honey Salt.  Andiron is even better.  This place is...a little odd. 

It starts with the entrance.   Yes...the entrance.  

They conveniently have a small parking lot behind the restaurant that is usually empty.  But when you park there, you walk up to a set of glass double doors that certainly looks like the entrance...it's locked and there is a sign that says to enter thru the front.  So you have to walk all the way to the front of the restaurant because that's where the hostess stands.  Pretty lame if you ask me.

The menu is odd also.  Nothing that makes you crave coming back.  My son ordered buffalo wings with a side of sweet potato fries.  He really enjoyed it.

I ordered the skirt steak which was okay.  It was reasonably priced at $24.  A decent cut of steak that was too tough.  The chimichurri sauce wasn't very flavorful.  The roasted cauliflower was really good and the steak fries were actually excellent.  

Service was very good.  The restaurant was pretty empty for a Saturday night.  There are three male manager/owner types that walk around and check up on tables.  I appreciate that...but sometimes too much checking on tables is uncomfortable. 

So like I said...I want to like this restaurant, but when I make a list of where I'm going to eat out, this place is pretty low on the list."}
{"text":"This is the second time coming here, and I love it! Last time I had indulged in the warm, sweet donut holes. This time, I had the Tivoli Market Salad. The portion was filling as an entree, and was pretty good! My friend had the salmon salad, which she loved. The star of the show was the banana pudding. I will probably have that every time! The service is super friendly. The atmosphere is definitely a notch above a sports bar. The setting is hip, even though there is football in every direction. Definitely a chill place to hang out with friends, or a casual date. Glad it's in Tivoli!"}
{"text":"Came to this spot not knowing what to expect, was surprised how empty it was for a Thursday evening. We started with the Pepper and Garlic Wings....not recommended.  We had to ask for a side of buffalo sauce, which made them tasty.  I went with the fish tacos for the entree and they were money!!! My wife went with the Breakfast Burger which was excellent! Service was awesome and would recommend to try out."}
{"text":"We had SuperBowl Sunday reservations at 3pm for the big game. We were seated in the bar area very quickly which was great but that's were everything kind of stopped. We were served water and then not checked on for about 15 minutes. There seemed to be plenty of servers in the area. But they were all busy or in the case of the server who was a Chiefs fan just standing with his friend watching the pre game on TV. I had to ask the person who filled our water glasses if we could order. The bartender eventually came over and took our drink order. This seemed to get the ball rolling. She was very nice but it seemed like she was taking care of the whole restaurant by herself. Also the restaurant made a big deal of their food offerings which included an all you can eat special but in order to get this everyone at the table had to order the \"deal\". But this was never stated on their website , had we known this we might have gone somewhere else. One other thing they ran out of beer and the manager had to \"go to the store\". Seriously you aren't fully stocked or prepared for a huge day that you've advertised on your website and in the store? Sadly this isn't the first time I was disappointed by the staff of The Honey Salt businesses. Two years ago on Fathers Day we walked out of Honey Salt because we were seated and then never acknowledged. At that time the manager called me to apologize because like yesterday I made a reservation through Open Table. He asked me to comeback and let him take care of us. We never did. I was hoping that they would have gotten better at handling high volume days but it doesn't seem like they have. It's too bad because the food at both places is great. We love to support local Las Vegas businesses but I don't think I'll be going back to either establishment."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I would've probably rated this establishment higher if it weren't for my last experience. 

Food was good, but service lacked. 

In the past I've had their grilled cheese w/tomato soup which was absolutely amazing. 
Their Chicken Salad - Chicken is super juicy and flavorful
Their Border Burger - Which quite honestly go with the Turkey Sandwich or one of the other two above. 

Okay, now like I mentioned food was good, but here is where the rating comes in. We came here on a brunch day and it wasn't too busy. Soooo I'm not sure why the service was so disappointing. Our drinks took forever to be served, a good 5-7 minutes, once they were served it took about another 10-15 minutes for our server to return and take our order. We ordered unlimited mimosas and in the 3hrs that we were dining here, well waiting more than dining, we were only checked up on 2-3 times. At one point the whole restaurant looked absolutely empty and we could've seriously walked out and no one would have noticed. Service should never be this slow when the restaurant isn't busy. Our server definitely tried to make it up by cracking a few jokes, but when you're hungry and wanting to have a good time, the humor just doesn't cut it.  

Would I be back? Only if I were in the area, but I feel I would have better luck and service at Brio or Echo and Rig."}
{"text":"We have been to the sister restaurant of this one, HoneySalt, and loved it.

This place, however, is even better. A bit less pretentious, with a more down to Earth menu, it has more of a tavern and bar feel, as the name states.

Happy hour specials were awesome. We tried the \"butcher style\" wings in Sriracha flavor. YUM. They were perfect, tender, juicy, and awesome.

For dinner, I had the \"fish fry\" which was just fish and chips. It was the highest quality of fish I have ever had in fish and chips, undoubtedly. The batter was light and flaky, just perfect. The dish came with a salt shaker full of malt vinegar flakes. They were the coolest thing, ever. You got to add a vinegar taste to your fish and fries, without making them soggy. It was the coolest thing I'd ever seen.

My husband had the ribs. The first half of the rack he commented that he had eaten better ribs at Chilis. The second half-rack, however, he devoured, without even wanting a second bite of my fish. I guess there wasn't much consistency on the evenness of the ribs. He was a little let down. His meal came with a cheddar bacon biscuit that was as good as those addictive little cheese biscuits we hate to admit we love from Red Lobster, with a more sophisticated taste, and of course, bacon.

Service was impeccable. 

Four stars due to the rib inconsistencies.

Also, they don't have a Brookie, like their sister HoneySalt. We were letdown by only three items on the dessert menu. There wasn't much for chocolate or ice cream lovers."}
{"text":"6 months ago I came here and service was really good. Yesterday (March 20) we stepped into Made and waited for 4-8 mins for someone to come over and greet us. More people behind us were getting frustrated that no one was sitting us. 

The manager on duty came over, by that time there were three separate groups waiting to be seated. When the manager comes over with an attitude like he was overwhelmed and stressed said \"it's going to be a while, we can sit you but it's going to be some time for the food to come out\" not even saying something like \"sorry about the wait\" 

Poor management. This place doesn't know how to plan and staff accordantly. 

Places like these don't make it very long. If this place doesn't change management and the head people that run this place it will not last just like the other places around that area."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice with my wife, once for lunch and once for brunch. 
I'd say the food just by itself gives this Tavern-style eatery 4 stars. 
Maybe we've gotten lucky with the team, but our servers have been the reason I rate this restaurant 5 stars. Not just friendly, but personable, and always moving with a sense of urgency while still remaining upbeat. You can tell when you're around people who genuinely enjoy coming to work. 
It was and hopefully will continue to be a pleasure dining at Made!"}
{"text":"This spot is located in Tivoli Village. I came here during brunch and I was seated right away. The server was Evan. He was friendly and had great suggestions. I picked the Chicken Chorizo tacos and it was good. Also, ordered tomato fennel soup with grilled cheese sandwich. The sandwich worked really well with the soup. For dessert, ordered donut holes for to-go and had the MADE smores there. The smores is best there because they bake the marshmallow and chocolate there so you can scoop it out with graham crackers. Overall experience, I was satisfied with the customer service and the food really filled me up."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill substantially since we first started coming here.   The service was awful.  I'm still not sure the guy who served us actually worked there.  That's how little he was interested in bringing us food and drinks.  The best part of the night was the gentleman who boxed up my food and refilled my water.   That star is for him."}
{"text":"....eeehhh.....I've had better. That's exactly how I feel. I've experienced better.
Let me tell you about my experience.
First, I walk in to meet a friend and I see a Ms. PacMan machine. HOLEEE COW. I love me some Ms. PacMan. Coin insert says .50 cents, so I put .50 cents in. Nothing. I put in another .50 cents, and nothing. By now my friend was here, so I didn't put any more money into machine. But I wasn't giving up. I wanted the game, or my money back.
We ordered the bacon cheddar biscuits, the dirty mac n cheese, the black truffle fondue and the bag of donut holes for dessert.
To me, it tasted like  everything tried really hard, but failed. It was like they made this stuff at home, and it was awesome, but when they make it in large quantities, it falls so short. Bacon biscuits were so dry and missing something. Bacon perhaps?
Dirty mac and cheese was Ok, better than anything else, but it wasn't great. The truffle fondue was a joke. Tasted and looked like it came right outta the microwave. That was the most disappointed item we had. Dessert was Ok but certainly not anything I'd come back for.
Back to Ms. PacMan......I told the waiter the machine was broken and he went and \"spoke to management\" and said they'd put a sign on it saying it was broken, and get my dollar back. Neither happened. I had to ask for my dollar (it was principle, I really would have rather played the game) and they didn't put the sign on. 
Service was Ok, prices were eh. It's not cheap but certainly not expensive.
Anyway, very doubtful I'd come back. I just wasn't impressed at all."}
{"text":"Odd timing and pacing and incorrect orders served made for an awkward dining experience at the latest spot by Elizabeth Blau and Kim Canteenwalla. Their staff, however, was well trained in the congeniality department, as their friendly demeanor tried to overcome service issues.

A half rack of ribs was as tender and smokey as expected, brushed with a sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. The bacon cheddar biscuit was amazing, trumping any childhood memories of devouring cheddar biscuits from that chain seafood restaurant I won't bother naming. I'm a fan of the mac and cheese, mainly because pork makes everything better. The black mission figs was a refined dish of nuanced flavors that almost seems out of place among all the comfort food. Chicken wings are available in different flavors. The buffalo wings were too subtle and didn't pack enough heat. The crab cake was somewhat underwhelming, mainly because of my irrational east coast bias and the lack of jumbo lump meat, which I prefer.

This place will only get better once they find their footing. Pricing may turn off some, but their location in Tivoli Village is to blame as I'm sure rent isn't cheap. 

3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Ok, so she's not new to the restaurant game! So I'll bang out the negative part of this review. It's loud. I mean REAL LOUD! There were 3 of us & we had to practically YELL in order to hear one another. The challenge? The high vaulted ceilings lined with tin/aluminum tiles that resonates the loudness even MORE! One more minor negative. The service. They are on top of it like their SUPER a game! They're SO on top of it that they barely allow you to finish a plate before they come by to pick up your dishes. Just slow you roll, and let us enjoy our meal and our time there.

Ok, enough with that, cause I got some GOOD stuff to say! The food? AWESOME!! The clams were YUMMINESS!!! The toasted bread was so good! We ordered every single small plate item plus the mac n cheese and those clams PLUS the s'mores nachos! Let me tell you, not once were we disappointed! Everything was AMAZING and SUPER yummy!!! You need to go before it gets too crazy to get in!!"}
{"text":"After the walk a thon to benefit the Goodie Too Shoes, we met up with friends at Made LV to discuss the Aspen trip and to try the food here.  After reading through many rave reviews, we were expecting great bites here.

Earl and I shared the biscuits and the putin.  Biscuits were delicious with the honey salted butter.  Putin on the other hand, was mediocre.  It could use more turkey gravy to give it more flavor.  More cheese curd would not hurt since it is what is giving it some salt.

For now, it's A-OK.  We will have to visit again and try other items."}
{"text":"The menu insight is described as \"inspired comfort food favorites\" meets \"a healthy touch.\" The  restaurant is open seven days a week for dinner from 5 to 11 p.m. and Wednesday through Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. for lunch. They also have happy hour everyday from 3-6 and 9-close.

Located in Tivoli Village. The restaurant is cute and cozy. They have outside seating area.

We came here last night for happy hour. This is my 3rd time here. I was crazing for chicken wings and they had one of the best wings. I like their Salt and vinegar wings and Louisiana Garlic Pepper wings. Their menu are interesting. For breads, I love their Bacon Cheddar Biscuits..so moist, baked so right with honey salt butter. They also have Lentil & Chickpea Hummus that comes with Made in L.V. pita chips. Small Plates such as Back Mission Figs..Balsamic roasted & fresh, goat cheese. The donut holes with berry jam is to die for.

The bartender was nice and friendly. The food came out very quickly. It is one of my fave place."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and sat at the bar.  There was no one at the front when I walked in so, since I was sitting at the bar I just walked over to it.  It took a few minutes before I was acknowledged; one bartender looked to be leaving and the other was just starting which may have had something to do with it.  But once I was the service was fine.  

I got the the nachos from the happy hour menu and tried two cocktails from their regular menu.  The nachos were very good, with the pork giving it a nice smokey flavor.  The cocktails were also good with the Bangkok Mule being the better of the two.  The Simply Blau, while also good, reminded me of a pomegranate Margarita and I've had better of those.  I'll probably come back and try out the regular menu sometime."}
{"text":"Most of their stars are for ambience. I like the string beans and Mac and cheese was great. I am impressed of how the turkey was prepared it was not dry and very flavorful. Smores dessert was good. I was not a big fan of some of the bread however it was too salty and the pickles too sweet. The place itself is nice and so are the waiters and waitresses."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for Sunday brunch. The big easy is the bomb. Service is great and the atmosphere is too. Loved the bloody mary's. Everything is fresh made and it shows."}
{"text":"I will definitely be coming back! Not only was the food delicious, but the service was absolutely incredible, which is a huge deal in making a meal out an enjoyable dining experience. Our waiter was friendly and helpful with drink descriptions, menu selections and clearing our dirty plates with new clean plates throughout our appetizer selections. Our water glasses were always filled and he was prompt without being over bearing. A true example for other restaurants I have visited recently that did not meet the standards MADE LV has. We ordered the salt and vinegar wings, the Siracha wings, the black mission figs, the double-stack burger meister, free-range turkey breast sandwich, bbq pulled pork and of course the banana pudding and loaded s'more nachos along with a few drinks. Everything was delicious, but our personal favorites were the salt and vinegar wings, the figs, the burger and the banana pudding. I highly recommend the banana pudding! We were a table of four and should have ordered that many instead of just one! Great service, great food and a fun atmosphere receive 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"WOOOOOOOW.   sometimes the smallest problems are made waaay bigger by AWFUL service.  love the place and the food was ... yea ok... but the place was quarter full... tons of empty tables and man we had to get up and ask for stuff from anybody we could find.   not going to review the food because at least for us... if the service isn't there... we'll pass.   Hope you all have better luck."}
{"text":"Great food and prices. Our waiter, Travis, was friendly and knowledgable. Sort of slow, but still worth it."}
{"text":"So this was a few months back...
Made LV has a great vibe feels like a good place to meet friends for drinks and grab a bite. Their are tvs and video games, a large bar area and a patio. The only draw back is the restrooms: they seem like forgotten somehow in overly kitschy feel of this place. The walls in there are just plain hideous. Please keep them clean! Other than that the atmosphere is great and I love the open kitchen. 

So, I really came here for the pimento cheese and the article in desert companion told me so...I am a southern and I love my pimento cheese in all it's forms from my own homemade version to more elevated versions. Now, it was good but there is no need to pour a bunch of olive oil on top of it. It seems like a Vegas thing to do like olive oil elevates homemade dishes to something gourmet. I myself love great olive oil on its own and pimento cheese as well and never the twain shall mix. The mayo has plenty of fat and oil and on top of it was too much. Also, the ground pepper from hell overwhelms the sharpness of the cheese. Yes, I did tell the waiter to give my two sense to the people in the kitchen. I pray they listened. Oh It looks like it's not on the menu anymore...shame. 

I had the Bahn Mi sandwich which was rather unremarkable. I would suggest pushing the limits. It was tasty but not like \"oh man that's the best Bahn Mi\" style sandwich ever. It was rather uncreative. And it looks like its not on the menu either....perhaps there is a learning curve. Hooray! Though I love both my Bahn mi and pimento cheese....maybe it will make a comeback better than before. The potential for awesomeness is definitely here. But this place is definitely a cool place to eat.

The chips were great, hot and served immediately. Yum! I am not gonna sell this one down the river yet. I want to go have a few drinks with friends and try it again soon.  Give it a try there seemed to be some interesting drinks on the menu as well as some great jar food offerings. 

I like that the menu evolves.."}
{"text":"Unique and delicious!  
Great atmosphere...  Congratulations to the Chef and entire staff
Awesome menu and excellent quality
It was fun and entertaining watching all the prepared dishes being served. 
Everything looked wonderful
Our lunch was very satisfying. 
We did not get to sample any dessert....  We were way too full!!!"}
{"text":"The menu is not very extensive here, and, in my opinion, a bit overpriced. The food was mediocre. I was disappointed that the ketchup was served in ramekins that had obviously sat in a fridge for awhile as there was a hard ketchup film over the top. Why bother? The ramekins were so small we needed more anyway. Drop the pretentiousness and just give people the ketchup bottle. My friend's order had an error,  and when another friend asked for something a little different from what was listed on the menu, she was told they couldn't do it that way. If you're going to be better (and more expensive) than casual fast food, then you should be able to accommodate a special request, which wasn't really that special."}
{"text":"I've dicovered this restaurant about a month ago, and I've been there for three times already. Every time was a pleasant experience. The service was great and the food delicious. The salt and vinegar wings were yummy, i also loved the brook trout and the clams. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"1st time here for a networking event. GREAT happy hour menu, Great prices on quality food with great service. Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Here's what you need to know: Dirty Mac n Cheese - small plate but deceivingly hearty - and tasty - burnt pork ends and Ritz cracker crust?! Can't go wrong! The PBR, shot of Jameson and pickle juice chaser - surprisingly good. If you think about it, it really works. 
The old license plate wall decor is a bit tired and overused these days, but overall the place was nice and service was good."}
{"text":"Finally, after lusting after some Instagram photos and peering through the windows on our way to nearby restaurants -- we tried Made LV during happy hour last Wednesday. I was pleased to see dog bowls outside (heaters, too!), boyfriend was excited about the plethora of TVs strategically placed about the bar, the high tops were comfy and everything felt just right in terms of environment. Clean, new, organized, appropriate.

Drinks: meh. Bartender was cool and helpful explaining that although this \"special\" vodka drink was advertised to have blood orange juice, that was out of season so it was made with plain orange juice. Glad we asked. Boyfriend ordered it anyway. I had a margarita that I'm not entirely sure was or was not created with a pre-made mix. It's happy hour, whatever. $5 each.

Food: \"Dirty mac and cheese\" was a delight, the crackers on top are genius. I'd been wanting macaroni and cheese for awhile, this was a treat. Again, helpful bartender ushered me toward the HH menu chicken tacos, which were the same as the regular menu yet cheaper. They were adequate, however, wish I would have asked for some hot sauce or salsa... something to add spice. I understand wanting to make it appealing to the masses, being able to add is easier than take away... but really they needed something. My boyfriend had the BBQ pork sandwich and he confessed at the end that more sauce would have been nice. He at the whole thing anyway, I didn't even get a bite. Nonetheless, his sweet potato fries and mustard aioli were the best part of the meal. I LOVE sweet potato fries and this was a superb portion. The aioli (can you tell I'm a sauce person yet?) was super.

My third taco (they were small and I was hungry, okay?) I bit into a bone. I'm not one to fuss about stuff, but since this is a new place and detail matters I pointed it out to the manager as he took my plate away (you know, just for future chickens to be served safely and whatnot.) He was gracious and apologized, took a little off the bill and offered a dessert. We declined the doughnuts and regretted it some later.

Will most likely return for gamedays (they have the NFL package) and bring the pup on a warm day when we can sit outside."}
{"text":"This is going to sound weird but I just discovered they have popcorn for free at the bar with free seasonings.   Throw on some Louisiana powder and it's like you're eating hot wings without the calories!"}
{"text":"Three things I like to base my reviews on are: price point, service, and taste. This place is good, but nothing to write home about. 

They were a little expensive for what you get. However, if you're here for brunch, you HAVE to get the Captain Crunch French Toast!!! This thing is to die for. 

Their bottomless mimosas are okay, but I wouldn't come here again for that at $20/person. Also, their service needs a little polishing. Our table was checked on a total of zero times once our food was served, with the exception of our mimosas never going dry. That is not okay.

All in all, this is a decent place to come. Good food, sub-par service, okay prices. Their French Toast is their saving grace. 

Would I recommend this place to others? Maybe. 
Would I come back here myself? If I'm in the area. I won't go out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. They have outdoor seating. Food was fabulous, but came here for happy hour and bartender was not very attentive. After the first bite of their burger meister, I wanted to order 10 of them.. Delicious!!! Great flavor :) the wings were also flavorful, but odd that tasted like bacon.. Which isn't a bad thing haha. The donuts with jelly was superb as well. They had summer solstice on tap, which is one of my top 3 fav summer beers so I was quite happy. The grapefruit beer is a must try. Will come back soon to try their bacon cheddar biscuits!"}
{"text":"We came to Made LV American Tavern for brunch and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  The food was delicious, the service was fantastic, and the atmosphere was low key and mellow.  Perfect for our lazy weekend state of mind.

We were greeted as soon as we entered and seated promptly.  The space was mostly full, but there were a couple of open tables.  Our server, Gatsby- in addition to having a cool name- was so nice throughout our visit!  She stopped by right after we sat down to give us the scoop on the specials and the AYCD cocktails.  The manager also checked on us a couple of times during our meal.  

We got the bottomless mimosa $22 and Shandy $20, plus a couple of iced teas.  The mimosa was stronger than expected for an AYCD and very good.  I did not try the Shandy.

CHICKEN CHILI $6.50- Amazing! 5/5. It was a bit more like a stew, than a thick winter chili, but the flavor profile was complex and vibrant.  Not very spicy either.

BACON CHEDDAR BISCUITS WITH HONEY SALT BUTTER $4.50- ours seemed a a little burnt, but they were still quite tasty and the butter is very good.

BIG EASY BENEDICT $13.00- Delicious! 5/5.  Country ham, eggs, and creole hollandaise on bacon cheddar biscuits.  Served with home fries.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the twist on hollandaise sauce was fantastic.

CLASSIC BREAKFAST $11.50- Very good 5/5.  Pretty standard breakfast of two eggs, bacon, crispy potatoes, and grilled bread, but all items were prepared how I like them and tasted very good.  The roasted tomato chutney was outstanding. 

BAG OF DONUT HOLES $7.00- OMG!  The menu says that these warm orbs of heaven come with salted caramel sauce, but ours came with the most deliciously orgasmic blackberry jam that I could have just eaten with a spoon if I forgot I was in public.  So good!"}
{"text":"Was excited that the beautiful Tivoli Village was getting another great restaurant. With all the great Yelp pictures I knew I really needed to partake in the greatness called, \"Made LV.\"  Really liked Honey Salt, so I was excited to try this restaurant. Appearance of the decor is new and trendy. Was greeted with a smile and was shown to our seats. Started out with the dirty Mac n cheese. The dish was a perfect portion size with flavors that worked well with each ingredient. Ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with the homemade potato chips. Wow, the flavors of this sandwich left an impression in my mind that this was the best BBQ pulled pork sandwich I have had in Vegas thus far. Tried a bit of the fish n chips dish and was o.k., but nothing I would personally ever order. A great experience that lived up to my own hype. Glad that another great restaurant is in the regular rotation list."}
{"text":"i kinda like honey salt so I was interested in experiencing the new venture.  I think i get what they are trying to do but the place has a severe identity crisis.  the menu isn't small but it feels like it. the beer menu flat out sucks.  another huge turn off is that the \"happy hour menu\" is only available at the bar or if you are sitting in \"high chairs\".  seriously? food wise, no surprise, it's pretty good.  we started with a jar of pimento cheese.  the taste was good but it was too creamy for me with no discernible visual evidence of pimentos.  the vegi accoutrements were pretty sad and a biscuit would have been a nice touch.  I had the hot dog for dinner.  it was really good but at $9.75 I would have expected more effort put into the fries that came with the dog.  they were pretty blah.  the donuts in a bag looked interesting for dessert but because I had applauded honey salt in my yelp review for resisting the 2005 rage, I passed on dessert."}
{"text":"I saw online that Made LV was having a Mardi Gras prix fixe dinner and I had to go.  The dinner was hosted by \"Back of the House Brawl's\" Jolene Maninna and Chef Canteenwalla.  I made a reservation for the start time at 6:30 and got there a few minutes before.  

The back of the restaurant was reserved for the dinner.  A server brought me an iced tea and suggested I might want to sit on the patio until they were ready.  I was joined by two women with whom I shared the rest of the evening and proved to be most excellent company.

In a short time, we were invited indoors and we took our seats at a four seat high top.  The food in order of presentation consisted of:  mini muffalettas, chicken gumbo, stuffed artichoke, jambalaya, and Cajun crawfish boil.  For dessert, we were served king cupcakes and hot beignets.  All the food was very good with two standouts, the gumbo and the jambalaya.  The broth of the gumbo was very rich and the jambalaya had a good amount of andouille, shrimp, and chicken.  I am not a crawfish person but it was OK for one night to mess with these little creatures and suck out the small amount of meat each one provides.  My feeling is that any crawfish should be served out of shell in an étoufée.  

The king cupcakes did not have a baby baked in any of them out of fear that someone would swallow one while eating the cupcake too quickly.  At our table, we all used forks to eat the cupcakes just in case and then our server explained why there were none.  The beignets were delicious and served very warm.  Fresh was the word for sure!!

This was a fun two hours.  Served family style and getting a chance to eat with previous strangers, it was a marvelous Mardi Gras evening.  The stand out besides the food was the wonderful staff.  Our server was John.  He had a great personality, used our names when talking with us, and was on top of everything.  Other staff came by the replace serving plates or bring a basket with more mini muffalettas and everyone was in good form!

I hope Chef Canteenwalla continues special events like this.  The price was good, the food was great, and the entire evening was enjoyable and memorable."}
{"text":"Celebrating my anniversary as well as a friend's birthday.  Decided to give this place a try based on the other Yelp reviews.  We are really glad we did!

First of all, it's very warm and inviting.  There are board games to have fun with (Sorry, Connect4, Apples to Apples) as well as books to read through.  We chose Uno to kill some time. Everyone was super friendly!  

Gatsby was out waitress and she was excellent!  Our plates were never left in front of us and our glasses were always full. I had the fish & chips. YUM.  Hubby had a special Jucy Lucy burger which he raved about.  Their Philly was full and cheesy and their burgers flavorful. For dessert we had donut holes with berry jam. Yummy!

Definitely will be back :)"}
{"text":"In the famous tone of Lil' John: \"What...?\". No, really, What?  I can't hear you from across the table.! Holy cow, I have been to UFC fights quieter than this place. 
Like Whitney Huston making sweet love to a jet engine, this place is shockingly loud.  

That aside, the food is astonishingly good. The burger is excellent, the humus is quite tasty, and the Mac n' Cheese is satisfying.  There are plenty of well cared about details present in the dishes.  Things like each fry having the proper amount of seasoning, the burger toppings are fresh and appealing, and the Mac n' Cheese being hot, but not like molten lava where you have to stare at it for a half hour before digging in.  

Aside from noise level which would even make Hellen Keller uncomfortable, the food is spot on. 

The service was good, with an attentive staff.  

Bring an appetite, but not a first date, unless of course they've already gotten on your nerves to the point that some downtime from talking would be welcome.

{"text":"Beer was flat and stale. Fish tacos were tough on the inside and soggy batter. Baja sauce was bad.  Only ate two bites and I'm worried I may get ILL."}
{"text":"My mother and I dined here for dinner on June 08. We sat in the dog patio area because I brought my yorkie with us. I love how they are dog friendly and very accommodating. John was our waiter and he was amazing. I eat out at least 5 times a week and I would say that this week he was the best service I had received, and yet it was our cheapest meal (only $46.75 before tip). The other gentleman that was helping him, I think was his busser, was also great and quick to check on us! It was dead inside, which was a bummer because I really want this restaurant to do well. The truffle found was so yummy and my burger was great too! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"If you find your self in Summerlin, near Tivoli Village. On any day of the week don't miss Made Lv, one of the 3 restaurants own by Elisabeth Blau and husband Kim. This is our first time for their famous Sunday brunch and I must say unbelievable the smoked beef Hash is to die for just full of flavor, the old fashioned toast sticks are not to be missed. Service is unbelievable..love sitting outside on one of their patios. The bar is happening great vibe. Can't wait to next Sunday."}
{"text":"This place is over-rated!! They were out of 4 of their menu items and the ribs were literally too attached to the bone to eat. The waitress was non-existent after we placed our order and had zero knowledge of the menu. Major disappointment. Do not recommend for food."}
{"text":"Located in Trivoli Village, it's a charming development perfect for date night or a dinner out with the family. Made LV has gotten a lot of publicity lately so we decided to try it out.  When we arrived we were told 15 minutes to get a table inside, 5 if we wanted outside, we picked wait 15 for inside. We told the hostess we'll grab a drink at the bar. Luckily, there was 2 seats together, we ordered a Bloody Mary for him which he found quite tasty and I had a vodka-club with muddled raspberries and a squeeze of lime, a simple concoction the bartender and I came up with since they didn't have any flavored vodkas. $17.00, normal for 2 cocktails. 15 minutes goes by, another 2 cocktails, $18.00, whaaaaaa? Okay.  30 more minutes goes by, where's our table? My husband asks the hostess about our table, she reassures him it's almost ready. 10 more minutes, I'm wasting away... Fortunately, I have muddled raspberries to chew on so I don't expire... Sitting and waiting an hour plus for our 15 minute table has given me to time to eye the decor which is very nice. Subway tiles line a counter and back wall area that has large chalkboards displaying different beers available. The tables are a dark wood with black metal chairs, a nice blend of farmhouse meets modern. What looks like reclaimed wooden planks line another large wall. The interior design and decor reminds me of something in Portland, Philadelphia or San Francisco, a nice change in scenery. 
Finally, the hostess comes over to us and says our outside table is ready. Huh? I say we'd requested inside. Oh. She wanders away in a half confused, half annoyed state. She returns 5 minutes later and gets us a table inside. Our waiter attends to us pretty quickly, a friendly guy. He gets us waters and asks with apps we'd like to try. Husband orders the buffalo butcher-style wings and also we place our dinner order. I get the BBQ chicken with steak fries substituted for mac n cheese, and Hubby gets the clams with red potatoes, corn on the cob and chicken chorizo in beer broth. The apps arrive with dinner, but I famished so I won't complain. The wings were okay, nothing spectacular, they seemed a bit wet and flavorless. Presentation on the metal plates was a nice touch though. BBQ chicken was pretty tasty, the sauce was delicious. Hubby ate all his plate, but said it wasn't as good as he'd hoped for.  We'd planned to get the s'mores nachos, but decided to walk around and get dessert somewhere else. All in all, ambiance was a hit, service (getting a table and apps separate from dinner) not so great (the waiter was a nice guy), price average ($63 for 2 people, minus cocktails). Not sure we'll return, looking forward to trying a couple other places getting a lot of talk right now."}
{"text":"I came in here on Sunday with my boyfriend.  It was our first time here.  We eat at Honeysalt a lot so I had high expectations.  Made is definitely a more casual vibe then Honeysalt.  There was a large bar, and I didn't realize there was outdoor seating since it was tucked away.  The hostess did not offer me a choice on outdoor seating which I was upset about after the fact, and didn't want to ask to be moved because my server seemed very sweet.  I think her name was Sienna or Sierra?  There was a lot on the menu that I wanted to try!  The waitress said she recommended the fig salad, so I did order one of those.  It was ripe figs in goat cheese, arugala, pistachios, pomegranate seeds and oil I think.  We also ordered the bacon and cheddar biscuits which were also fantastic and exactly what it sounds like.  The dirty mac and cheese was also good- it seemed to have peas and bacon inside with a gratin top.  I also ordered the shrimp and cilantro fritters.  These were like hushpuppies with maybe a small shrimp inside, corn, cilantro and a liquefied mousse-type dipping sauce that was all cilantro-flavoured.  I love cilantro so I did like the sauce.  The fritters were good but a bit greasy and not enough shrimp to my liking.  My boyfriend also ordered the eggplant Reuben, which is not something I would think I would like because I don't eat Reubens but love eggplant.  I ended up eating half his sandwich and loved it!  It was a very generous portion of sandwich and eggplant.  My last order was the doughnut hole bag.  I did like them, and the fruity sauce, but my boyfriend did not care for them.  They are comparable to the doughnut holes at Stack in the Mirage.  I would prefer chocolate sauce to Boysenberry but the Boysenberry was still good.  Food arrived very quickly and our total bill (not including gratuities) was just under $55.  That meal was a steal!  I will absolutely be back (but next time I will request outdoor seating.)"}
{"text":"The decor is a little confusing, not sure the theme of the restaurant. We started with the ham and cheese plate it was well done. I has the fish fry for dinner, portion size was perfect. Prices are a little high."}
{"text":"Meh. Came in with a friend for dinner on a Monday night. The place had a nice casual ambience, with lots of seating. 

After perusing the menu with some interesting sounding items, I decided on the Fish Fry. I've been in a fish n chip kinda mood recently,  and the malt vinegar powder sounded right up my alley. I wasn't sure if I wanted to have something to drink with dinner, and the server brought me samples of 3 of his favorite beers, which was really cool of him. I even liked one of them enough to order it with my fish n chips!

Now,  when I asked about the portion of the meal I was told it was 3 pieces of cod, which sounded like a good deal for just about $20. When it came out, it was actually 5 pieces... of what looked to be 1 filet cut up to be bite sized.  So yeeeeeah, not that great. The malt vinegar powder wasn't what I was expecting either. The flavor was so subtle I practically emptied out the entire shake to get a good taste. The coleslaw was meh, the fries were meh (they have a lot of these, though). Not very busy in our section, but I overheard there might have been a large party in the back? Either way, after our order was brought to the table, we didn't really get checked on (maybe once?).

Overall, pretty standard, but what I had wasn't really worth the price. I am tempted to check out these doughnut holes, though."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! Bottomless mimosas. Everything our group was in the mood for we could order. Delicious donuts, French toast, waffles and fried chicken, and breakfast tacos. Salt and Vinegar wings , salads, everything was DELICIOUS. We will be regulars. Sat on beautiful patio. Weather was terrific. This place rocks"}
{"text":"Our waiter, John, was awesome! He definitely made our dining experience that much more enjoyable! And the brook trout was so delicious! The salt & vinegar chicken wings were also tasty. They weren't your average wings. They were a whole chicken wing. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food nice atmosphere and great service! 
The wife and i went here for lunch. First we got the dirty mac n cheese nice creamy cheesy goodness We also got the nachos verry tasty! Main corse i went with the burger it was cooked perfectly nice n juicy the bun it was on was really fresh and toasted just right, The wife tried the eggplant pastrami  samich she wasnt as impressed with this one nothing about it resembled pastrami, really more like a patty melt, But overall great  experience we will be back to try some more stuff"}
{"text":"Amazing day. Went for a late lunch. Grab a stack of Uno cards and hung out on the patio. Perfect spring day. Food and service was very good. Waiter was funny and very interactive. Great time."}
{"text":"Made reservations for the latter part of lunch time and was greeted by Jeff, who was also our server. He was very VERY attentive but not intrusive. He was there when we needed him and allowed us time to hang out and catch up. We were there to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and he made the experience wonderful. His attentiveness and thoughtfulness even made the paying for the check easy and uneventful, no fighting for the check!

We started with a couple of appetizers: Dirty Mac and Cheese and the hummus, both were awesome. The kids order burgers off their very creative book menus to keep the kiddos occupied and we ordered the half chicken and calms. Everyone walked away full and definitely planning on our next visit to MadeLV. Another incentive for me is that they have Steigl Grapefruit beer, one of my favorites.  We loved the Christmas ambiance, Jeff was amazing, and the food was great. American tavern with a twist, definitely a great addition to Tivoli."}
{"text":"Been twice now - once for dinner and once for lunch. Both times I felt service was a little off. Both times I sat on the patio, wonder if that is why? Not sure.

Moving on. For dinner I had their version of a bahn mi, which doesn't even appear to be on the menu anymore as of 2/20/15. Not sure if maybe it is a seasonal offering? I did enjoy the sandwich, although the bread was kind of tough. Came with fries in a cute little bag. One of Made LV's strong points is extra cute plating. 

The last time I dined here was for a lunch, myself and a co-worker took our manager out. It was a really nice day so we sat on the patio. Inside the red hat society was taking up a large portion of the restaurant and there were probably about 30 of them, so I think the place was over-loaded with their food order. Our food took about 45 minutes to arrive, and they forgot our biscuits as an appetizer. We even had to ask where our food was. Funnily enough as soon as we asked - it appeared within minutes. Not sure what was going on there. I think this lack of service, and lack of apology as to the food taking so long is definitely bringing down my rating.

Once the food arrived, it was delicious. I had the double-stack burger, comes with lettuce, tomato, red onions, and a pickle. It was cooked well, and it tasted good, but it isn't anything worth writing home about.

Overall Made LV is doing aaaall right. Not sure I will return. I've given it two shots and neither of those times has thoroughly impressed me."}
{"text":"We were on the search  for something new when we came upon Made LV Tavern in Tivoli Village. The menu is full of comfort food that will make you feel warm and fuzzy inside!

Bacon Cheddar Biscuits sounded like a great way to start the meal. They came with a honey butter salt dip. The biscuits were soft but I only had a bite because I know my husband loves biscuits so I let him have them.  They didn't last too long ! I had some salt and pepper kettle chips coming out so I didn't mind. My chips came with smoked onion dip. They were served warm and toasty and were delicious. 

I had the fried chicken entree with mashed potatoes and a side of collard greens.The chicken was really tender but I really wanted the chicken to be crunchier like Popeye's or KFC. It was well seasoned and it went well with the mashed potatoes. I'm not a big fan of collard greens but I had a little because I know they are good for you. 

I wanted to taste my husband's burger since I gave him the biscuits . The burger was super tasty even though he had his burger cooked very well done . ( I prefer medium rare) If you are looking for a good burger you should check this place out! 

We took the donut holes that came with caramel sauce to go. We needed to digest a little so after the short drive home we were ready for them. They were fluffy and lightly sugared. A perfect ending to a comforting meal!"}
{"text":"They are OPEN, but I understand that they hanged their hours.  Also I heard they are moving to another location in a month or two."}
{"text":"Experience:  So good!!  Brought a friend for dinner to try this place out since I saw it had some great reviews. 

Facility:  very contemporary feel with high and low tables and chairs for seating. Also seemed to be a patio that it was too cold to enjoy. 

Service:  some good and bad points...our waiter was good, but once we said no to dessert, he immediately brought our check, although we were both drinking beer. Maybe they needed the table?! 
It was nice that the owner came by a few times for general chat. 

Food:  we decided to split several appetizers, so we could taste more things. 
Mac and cheese: had meat and peas in it, and a good cheese flavor.  I'm not a big pea fan, but they weren't overwhelming the flavor or anything. 
Fondue: was decent. Nothing to write home to mama about. 
Sweet potato fries: were great and sauce was amazingly addictive just like owner said!
Nachos: were good, but I had to pick off a bunch of onions that were not listed on the menu. 
Tenaya Creek was on tap and was good as usual. 

Overall:  I enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere, so I would definitely come back (and will for sure when the figs are back in season!)"}
{"text":"Go see Matty, great service his drinks are on point and who doesn't want to hear a Boston accent while drinking! Music is always great as is the food.. Killer happy hour to boot"}
{"text":"Excellent! Came in for happy hour. And,food was fantastic. We ordered the nachos, burger and tacos. The biscuits were AMAZINg! Don't forget dessert! Doughnut holes! Yum!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at how small this place is, it's more a bar than a restaurant.  I would come here again just for the banana pudding.  It's the bomb.  And maybe the bacon cheddar biscuits.  Otherwise the food was just okay overall.  They can handle a crowd really well though, and the drinks are stiff."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant twice.  I think the service and food is good, although somewhat expensive for the quantity you get.  I absolutely love their cheesy bisquits!"}
{"text":"I recently attended one of Made's events- Mardi Gras party for 2015. I can not begin to tell you how much fun it was! We were led to the back entertainment area where the tables were dressed in newsprint NOLA style. The first course was the most a mini muffalata sandwich and a complimentary hurricane. They should put these beauties on the regular menu they were simply the best start. This was followed up by gumbo served in mini cast iron ramikins. I am a huge fan of gumbo and this was smooth tasty with a subtle kick. The chefs came out with live crayfish to tease all of us. Everyone loved the \"floor show\"! Fresh seafood in this town is always appreciated. The down home boil Traditionally potatoes cray fish and fresh corn medallions- KILLER! The knockout punch was the jambalaya. Better than anything I have eaten in NOLA- almost buttery! The sweet ending was handmade Beignets and mini king cakes. Chef Kim is going to run these events a couple of times
A month in various topics pairing food and spirits. They are priced well for the amount of food and drinks. I urge you to call and find out what is next on the calendar for Chef Kim and staff. If you have not come to MADE you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Nice new restaurant in Tivoli. Excellent service, food, and atmosphere. The room is a bit noisy but bearable. 

We had crab cake, oysters, fish & chips, and smores nachos. All were very tasty and served very creatively. Service was very good. Some decent cocktails on the menu, decent wine list, and an okay draft beer list. Nothing special but decent. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"I got the Long Island ice tea and it was on tap. I was skeptical, but it was very good! We tried the bacon cheddar biscuits which were tasty. It was a fun, brightly lit bar. I will definitely need to return and try dinner."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour on Monday night to watch the football game. Everyone in our group left with extra drinks on their tab. This place will take advantage of large groups and charge you more than what you ordered. Portions are small and food less than stellar. Save yourself the time and money and go somewhere else in the complex. There are many better options with better service and more honest servers."}
{"text":"We've been here twice recently, and both times were treated with extremely friendly staff, incredible food, and fast service.  The grilled salmon is especially delicious, and bartender Matty even remembered us the 2nd time around.   I highly recommend this venue, and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my meal (brunch) and the service was good.  I'd like to go back and try the happy hour menu. 

Only recommendation would be to have butter or jam for the grilled bread and season the food more."}
{"text":"Husband and I went here for date night. We were excited to come eat here after looking at the menu online. But sadly enough, we regret it. Service and the abeyance was good but the food was not all that great. Biscuits were cold in the middle and the batter on the fish fry was mushy. The funniest thing we saw was watching the managers or owners standing around like they were lost."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Love that they have different card games and board games available for families while we are at the table. They need to make a lot more non pork options available. Otherwise the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"A little bit late coming but at least it made it.

Friends and I went to check out the place after hearing so many great things about it. I mean come on, an off shoot of Honey Salt, why wouldn't we?

Most restaurants won't sit until your whole party is present.  Well I didn't face that problem here.  Being the first one to show up for once the hostess was very pleasant and directed me to an open table while I waited for everyone to arrive.

The ambience was very relaxed. Lighting set the mood. Not too light, not too dark. Just the correct amount of lighting which set the start of a great night! However, on a Saturday night, it was very evident that the clientele was not toward the youngeryounger crowd. Which was fine by me! Only meant that we wouldn't be stuck waiting long for service, irate customers, etc.

When everyone arrived we started off with a few rounds of drinks. Nothing jumped out soecialty drink wise so we just ordered beers on tap, vodka drinks, Jameson shots and wine throughout the course of what turned out to be a 2 hour meal.

Bacon Cheddar Biscuits. Very cliché  and all but everything tastes better with bacon! The biscuits were soft. Not hard. Very but try and just the right amount of bacon. Not over powering. And that's just the biscuits itself. Add the honey salt butter and my friend and I had to fight over who would get the last biscuit. We settled to have an extra order to go before we left because it was that good ( but after a couple hours of drinking we forgot! :-( )

\"Bacon and Eggs\" - It was deviled eggs set atop red onion jam and thick cut bacon accompanied with toast. One more dish that we had to fight over who was getting the last pieces. Bacon was so tender! Practically falls apart in your mouth. I am the type of person that views  deviled eggs as homey and should not be ordered at a restaurant unless there was a wow factor to it. And this makes me want to come back and have another go at it. The red onion jam had the right amount of sweetness to it that balanced out the mustardy flavor of the deviled eggs. I highly recommend it!

Smoked Ham Hock Nachos - I was not disappointed! The nachos came out crisp and not soggy. All the components complimented each other without ever being overpowering. 

American Ham and Cheese Board - Working in catering I get to sample better cheeses than what they offer but I was not disappointed with the selection and presentation. The cheese selections were Tillamook Cheddar, Laura Chenel Chevre and a buttermilk blue. All American cheeses from the west coast region. The hams were Three Little Pigs and Benton's Ham. What I was most drawn to was their mustard. I wish there was more of it on the board itself. Great accompaniment to the cheeses.

Chinese Chicken Salad - you would think it would be plain, even with the listed ingredients. But nope! Very refreshing salad. 1 order fed all four of us.

Roasted Bartlett Pear Salad - contained roasted pear and fresh honey crisp Apple slices. A very light and refreshing appetizer salad. Can't go wrong here. Roasted pears were done to perfection. Not over cooked. The fresh crisp apples added a nice contrast to the other ingredients. 

Bag of Doughnut Holes - we didn't have enough room after all the drinks and the food but we somehow managed to sneak in a dessert. The doughnut holes were light and fluffy. Not very heavy. A perfect ending to the meal if you want to keep it light (yes it's fried leave me alone). The salted caramel could stand to be a bit more saltier (hence the name) but I like my salt.

Staff - after all of the drinks we forgot the names of our server and runner. But they were very attentive. Quick to banter with your group and made the dining experience that much better. Nothing worse than a server that doesn't to be there. 

Overall - I would come back again after hearing there was an industry night! Can't wait to go back again. After all the food that we ate the check split four ways was around $40 - $50 / person. They hit the mark with their delivery of a modern take on comfort foods. Definitely recommend it to friends and looking to come back for more!

{"text":"So I have to post something about this even tho the restaurant is closing in 2 weeks. Me and my wife went to have dinner and drinks here last night. Love the fact that the food has a fun spin on things. We went and were seated by the manager and looked through the menu. We ended up ordering the Nashville hot chicken sandwich and split it. Before my wife took a bite she looked down at her chicken and noticed that the meat WAS RAW!!!!! Not a little bit cooked and pink in the middle. RAW!... We told our waiter/bartender about the situation and he apologized and removed the item off of our bill and discounted the rest at 30%... Now idk about you, but I took a couple bites out of my RAW chicken sandwich. Which could make me very sick... Don't you think the whole meal should have been comped??? But... Regardless me and my wife sat and decided to maybe try dessert... So we ordered and ordered another drink hoping it was just the chefs mistake...45 minutes later.... No dessert... So either the waiter didn't put our order in... Or the chef needs to be fired... So again.. Got our drinks comped off the bill... And left over $19 dollars... My wife has worked as a bartender and a server and so she struggles not to tip people in the service industry... Leaving the bartender a $10 dollar tip...which I honestly can't believe she did.. But we are working on her being too generous lol... Honestly this place is the worst.. And only go there if you are looking to get salmonella"}
{"text":"Last night I was really excited to visit this location as I heard that two of my favorite people would be playing music in the patio. I thought it would be great to have something to munch on and a warm drink or two, sitting outdoors, next to the warm fire, listening to some great live music. I sat and listened to some great live music for the 2.5 hours I was there. As the band had taken their one break, the manager, very unprofessionally came out tapping his watch like a parent getting on their child because they've taken a break from their homework. What was even more embarrassing for the manager was that at the time he did this, no one was out on the patio at that time because it had just become too cold, in addition to no wait staff coming out to serve you a warm meal, snack or drink! Once management gets a grip on their wait staff, I would enjoy going back to hear my friends perform! Instead, I heard that management asked the performers not to come back. Hmmm, maybe the owner needs to get on their management for their lack of managerial skills and bad decision making. No need for me to back now."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here. We had a lovely table on the lovely patio on a lovely Sunday morning. And our servers were friendly and attentive.

Unfortunately, I was universally disappointed by the food. It was all significantly less satisfying than I had expected it to be. To the point that I kept wondering if the problem was me. But I don't think it was. The food just missed the mark--almost as if it were trying too hard. In fact, 'way' and 'too' were the operative adjectives. Too rich (the signature biscuits). Way too sweet (the french toast sticks). Way way too fried (the home fries). Way way way too dense and dry (the banana pudding).

The pudding was particularly disappointing. I was looking forward to rich, smooth, creamy pudding, layered with whipped cream and wafers. I was served a poorly executed trifle. The home fries were similarly disappointing. They were unnecessarily deep-fried, to the point of being hard and crunchy.

I left Made LV feeling as if I had eaten an incredibly unhealthy meal, but not in the good way. Good, delicious, unhealthy food satisfies cravings that healthy food never can. This meal just made me wonder why I had eaten so much saturated fat without ever having to ask myself why unhealthy food tastes so good?"}
{"text":"Went in at 2pm on a Saturday... The service was phenomenal!!! Please see my attached photos for the amazing food I ordered. We had a few things to try and everything was amazing!!! The place is decorated beautifully, and the prices are reasonable. The alcohol was a bit pricey but amazing selections and variety. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. I went here for brunch with my best friend. We were seated immediately and a server came over right away. Our server was amazing and very attentive. The reason I took a star away are the portions are really small. I ordered the deviled eggs which were delicious but it was one egg cut in half! The bread was delicious that came with it though. I also ordered the breakfast taquitos and they were tiny surrounded by a whole lot of black beans. I just wish there was more protein on the entree I was so hungry! The flavor was perfect but the portions nope! We had to leave and go eat a second brunch elsewhere because we were still so hungry. 

It was a really cool atmosphere and I think it would be better for happy hour or a drink then a small brunch."}
{"text":"I feel like this joint changes a lot in Tivoli village. And anytime I've been to one of the new places in this slot, I can see why. They're usually mediocre with okay service. 

And that is what we had last week. Horrible service at the bar with good food. 

We both had burgers. I had the Hang Over? It's newer on the menu. It had a fried egg, bacon, jam and cheese. The patty was overcooked, but the rest of the ingredients picked up the slack. 

We were there for over 2 hours and we kept having to get the bartenders attention to get something. There was a girl who sat next to us that he was very attentive to though...
And this place was dead for a Friday night. Which should show you, that's not a great sign. Most places in Vegas on a Friday night are PACKED. 

I feel \"meh\" about this place. I wasn't impressed for the price or the service."}
{"text":"First time at made, our food came out in a timely fashion and was hot.
We had the wagyu skirt steak- cooked perfect, stuffed artichoke was great no one does them like that, oysters super fresh. Service was good, our waiter was made some nice suggestions. The decor was fun, love the video games , music selection rocked! We will be back...."}
{"text":"The birthday festivities continue!

Okay not so much this was my last spot. I wanted to try a new place with a friend who wanted to take me out for a late dinner. Honestly, I love how gourmet food looks but the presentation only goes so far for me. I skimmed through pictures my fellow yelpers posted and noticed some entrees were missing from the menu tonight. I believe, the menu was recently changed but everything we had was great comfort foods. 
Our server and the busser were very attentive to our table. It was a bit slow so I could respect the multiple check ups we had. When I go to new places I always ask what the server likes and tonight he recommended their hummus!!! It was delicious and I highly recommend it and a great portion. We had the deviled eggs as well. I was kinda disappointed in the size it was one egg cut in half with a thick slice of crispy bacon on the side. I didn't eat the bacon because I don't eat pork but for the sake of credit it was really thick slice and my friend enjoyed it!! I got a \"spicy\" chicken sandwich with a pesto sauce and shredded lettuce. It was good but nothing to rave about. I would come back to try that eggplant sandwich. We did get dessert and like must of you we got the donut bites! They were kind enough to write happy birthday on the tray. PS, we be-careful with the candle and paper bag. I blew my candle lightly into the bag and almost set it on fire. Lol

This place reminds me of Therapy (Downtown) and Public School (Downtown Summerlin) so if those places impressed your taste buds than this one will do so as well."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Prices are reasonable. Love the cold beer.  The manager Oscar came to our table and greeted us.  We had lots of fun!  Food is good too.  A bit more casual than the surrounding restaurants which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Well hello Made... welcome to the realz ;)
You were much anticipated to the 'hood. And while you have delivered sufficiently enough.. I personally believe you could be SOO much more. Consistency maybe your only flaw. 

Love your menu, love what you want to be...for those that only want to read the first few lines - yep, will definitely be back ;) As options for this area..you are doing everything right..very very right.

Love very much how Tivoli is evolving. (well, except for Brio, but .. no comment except for this about chains - they have their place) General appreciation for the valet...but parking is not problematic enough (yet) to need to valet. It is simply a 1% type of bs at the moment. 

New American type of menu, livers, crostini, fries in paper bags, craft cocktails...happy happy.. the menu reads and it delivers...we are not moving mountains here (yet).. but perhaps we have stood at the base looking up at the peak. looking to you Made LV...bring us to the promise land...we will happily follow."}
{"text":"When I go to Las Vegas, all I do is eat.  Luckily for me, my best friend is a local out there and she takes me to a ton of restaurants way off the Las Vegas Strip.  Made - LV is in a gorgeous, newly built shopping center quite a ways away from the strip.  It's a lovely restaurant, and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  That's a bonus!  

The dishes here are pretty small, which was great only because I got to try a bunch of different things.  We ordered the Bacon and Eggs, which consisted of one deviled egg (2 halves), some toast, and a really thick slice of yummy bacon.  Everything on the plate was good, it was just really small and hard to share between 5 people.  Next, we had the chicken liver, which also came with toast and pickles.  Most people don't like liver, but I LOVE it, so I had to try it.  It was well made, there were no harsh flavors, it was just creamy and perfect to spread on a nice piece of toast.  We also had the mac and cheese (nothing special), nachos (that was massive, but nothing special either), and bacon cheddar biscuits (ok, those were pretty good, and you could really taste the bacon baked in there).  I think that was all we ordered, since we were drinking beer.  They did have a nice selection of beers from local breweries.  I think that menu changes though, but I'd check it out.  

The food was decent, but I wasn't blown away by it.  I think the prices were a little on the high side, considering each of the dishes were pretty tiny.  It hasn't made my list of places to return to when I hit up Vegas again, but I won't say no if someone insists that they'd like to try it.  If I come again, maybe they'll change my mind.  A girl can wish."}
{"text":"Loved my experience here. My waiter \"Jeff\" gave us the best service, he really knew the menu and gave us excellent advices. The bacon cheddar biscuit is excellent, bbq pork ribs were tender and great. Everything we order is total recommended. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Captain Crunch French toast! I really enjoyed the brunch menu, decor, and service at this restaurant."}
{"text":"On Cinco de Mayo, Made LV American Tavern was the most attractive dining choice in Tivoli Village because my husband and I could get seated immediately. Cantina Laredo, on the other hand, had an astounding two hour wait! So much for having Mexican food on Cinco de Mayo, right? But, I digress...

EGGPLANT RUBEN ($10): Made LV's menu is quite small and there are even fewer options available for vegetarians. In all my years, however, I've never seen an eggplant ruben! The sauerkraut was barely detectable, as was the 1000 island dressing. The eggplant itself seemed to be void of any seasonings. The sandwich overall was just okay. I wouldn't get it again, but it was worth a shot. The meal came with a big bag of house chips, but I would've preferred fries!! 

SMOKEHOUSE BURGER ($12.50): Hubby promptly demolished this meaty burger and gave it the thumbs up. I helped myself to his bag of fries. :)

SERVICE: Made LV seriously fell short on service. Our server took about 5 minutes to greet us and take our orders. Then, he hardly checked up on us thereafter. My husband's coke was empty for days before it was refilled. The server didn't smile or attempt to feign friendliness, and I just felt like we were bothering him. 

AMBIANCE: Loved the industrial feel inside Made LV. I realized towards the end of my meal that there was a whole separate seating area behind the bar. Wish I would've sat there instead (since it's 21+)! There's an outdoor patio dining area as well. 

Worth a Return Visit?
My eggplant ruben wasn't particularity spectacular and the service was lackluster, but I'd be down to come back to Made LV to give them a second try.

The newest addition to Tivoli Village, MADE LV fills the seemingly cursed spot formerly inhabited by Bradley Ogden's Hops & Harvest and featuring the culinary talents of Kim Canteenwalla it was to a wide sampling of the restaurant's nouveau-American menu that I sat down with eight friends on Saturday afternoon, the results a resounding success as fourteen plates delivered in five courses arrived to nearly universal praise.  Offering a relaxed environment with touchtunes playing at a modest levels beneath a bistronomic tin-style ceiling as the Little League World Series showed on a pair of LCDs it was at a large banquette that our party was sat and with the open atrium bathed in sunlight our meal began quickly, the service spot-on throughout our two hour stay with several visits from the Chef himself assuring all was well.   Speaking next to the quality of the food it can only be said that while perhaps 'simple' by some standards the execution of nearly every dish of the afternoon was nothing short of exemplary and with much of our order trending towards the menu's heavier offerings it was perhaps unsurprising that flavors presented with aplomb, the cheddar biscuits a full-frontal savory assault finding levity in the creamy house blended butter while both the pimento cheese and rich fondue arrived in plethoric portions with extra chips and crackers offered compliments of the house.  Moving next to things more complicated the very few faults of the meal were found in early-season figs that had not yet found maximum sweetness and fries that trended slightly less crisp than savory toppings would afford but with deviled eggs set aside crisp bacon soon followed by reference standard mac n' cheese plus juicy wings rife with smoke beneath intensely crisp skin one would be hard pressed to complain - a trio of All-American sweets every bit on par with the savories finally rounding out a meal that more that lived up to the restaurant's promise of \"good food, good drinks, and good company\" from beginning to end."}
{"text":"I went to Made for the first time this weekend. Since I was alone, I sat at the bar. I ordered a Bangkok Mule, which was refreshing and tasty. I also got the chicken tacos, which were just the right size and a great blend of flavors. I'm a fan and will definitely be back. The prices are great for Vegas, too."}
{"text":"Good brunch, not the best bloody I've had but the price is right. Eggs Benedict was on point (on fleek as the kids say these days). Super friendly and attentive staff. All around a good time. Nice outdoor space. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best bar in Summerlin. Great bartenders, great beers, good food, excellent décor.

Impossibly crowded Saturdays."}
{"text":"Don't miss the bacon cheddar biscuits!  Fish is always fresh and good. Bar/pub style ambiance is good. Parking either self or valet."}
{"text":"First time here. Friendly staff and knowledgeable bartender. Only came for a few quick bites and some coctails. My fiance and I each hand a handful of custom cocktails and they were delicious! We decided to enjoy the fish and chicken tacos and they were really flavorful.  Obviously, I can't speak for the other items, or why other people say that the food isn't  any good. What we had was great and we'll be returning to try more menu items in the future - as well as to hang with Matty at the bar! Only reason for not 5 stars is I haven't tasted other menu items. Will update in the future!"}
{"text":"I'm not a drinker so I wanted to have just a couple of non-alcoholic beers.  $12...WOW...I didn't realize they had found the distributor that put gold in the bottle caps.  WTF?  Way out of line for that type of product."}
{"text":"I feel like my fiancée is going to be upset with me when she sees that I've given Made 2 stars instead of one, but my burger was pretty good. Creekstone Farms patties, stacked two high, with a nice sharp cheddar on a soft brioche bun. The fries were served topped with sea salt and cracked black pepper. Pretty good burger and fries for $15.

But beyond that, our experience at Made showed evidence of a seriously mismanaged restaurant. We showed up for brunch and we order drinks. I order a Bloody Mary, and she orders the bottomless mimosas. Our waiter returns and tells me that they've run out of Bloody Mary mix, since it's made in-house and bla bla bla whatever. We showed up at 1pm, when brunch is supposed to last until 3 - you advertise bottomless Bloody Marys and you run out two hours before the end of the meal? Really? So my fiancée and our friend order the bottomless mimosas, and after one round, our waiter returns and tells us that they've run out of champagne - and would they like to switch to Micheladas or mojitos or bla bla whatever. Again - you run out of an item advertised as bottomless? After selling it? And that certainly wasn't house-made champagne. This restaurant is 500 feet from a Total Wine store. How are you gonna run out of champagne at Sunday brunch?

Okay, now I'm angry enough again to take back that second star.

The third strike was when we asked for our check, and it sat under a credit card waiting to get picked back up for more than 20 minutes. There were maybe three other tables still eating in the whole restaurant, and our waiter literally walked right past without even looking in our direction more than once. My fiancée's review of Made includes a photo of our waiter basically taking a nap in the front of house while our check sat there collecting dust. I'm inclined to be a little more charitable about it than she was. Obviously you have terrible managers. Obviously your restaurant is a terrible place to work. But don't take it out on us.

One star, only because Yelp won't let you give zero."}
{"text":"Brunch review only:

I can only assume that this place will end up out of business in 6 months time like every single restaurant that has ever occupied this particular space in Tivoli Village. This is probably the 5th restaurant that Ive noticed in the building and they simply never end up successful. 

The restaurant was empty, unsurprisingly, and the service a little slow given the circumstances. But ultimately, the food was pretty good- definitely above average and that's enough to at least consider going back if Im in Tivoli in the future.

-Bacon Cheddar Biscuits. What is there to say really. They are bacony and cheddary and biscuity. Obviously very tasty. Biscuit was flakey on the outside and melty on the inside.

-Corned Beef hash. Pretty good. Nothing fancy or creative certainly although the presentation was definitely above average. Seasoned well. Solid dish.

-Breakfast Tacos. Chorizo avocado eggs queso fresco and more. Not bad by any means. I could probably make this myself with relative ease though.

-Donut Holes. Only average. Jam not blowing anyone away. Donuts freshly baked and warm though.

At the end of the day this place is probably a 3.5. What I ate was good but it didnt quite feel like something I needed to get at a restaurant and couldnt make at home. Now will I make this food at home? Certainly not, Im not a pleb. But I could. Compared to many other brunch locations in Vegas it has some work to do but the food tasted above average which is enough for me to feel satisfied."}
{"text":"Places like these kill me; so much potential yet quality of food and pricing is horrible! If you are looking for a place to dine with no reservations and small portions with over priced items, this is your place!
We came here on a Sunday at 11am and was shocked to see that we were the only ones there. Sunday Brunch has been the new trend so seeing no one was an instant red flag. 
Basically to sum up the experience, the server was experienced enough to make a decision on my nephews blue berry pancakes that were ordered to take the blue berries out because he would like it better, your breakfast 'entree' is really an appetizer, toast-well lets just say they throw it on a grill to warm it for you but basically you get warm soft bread with no jam or butter. The breakfast tacos, 3 to a plate which consisted of 3 bites with that horrible green color 'fake' guacamole on it yet the description clearly said avocado. The frittata is really just a flat greasy omelet. I had to google it to make sure I knew what a frittata was; doesn't even compare. 
Looks are definitely deceiving. I'll do you a favor and tell you to cross it off your 'places to try' now."}
{"text":"Seven Yelpers and two Yelpers-in-training, AKA small children with good taste, arrived at 11:30am on the Saturday after Made LV opened its doors for business. Basically the first ones there, the empty restaurant eventually filled up as we made our way through much of the menu together.  Because we shared, it was a good way to taste a bit of each dish.

We had:  Cheesy Garlic Toast, Bacon Cheddar Biscuits, Pimento Cheese, Smokey Bleu Cheese Fondue, Black Mission Figs, Bacon & Eggs, Baked Artichokes, Breakfast Poutine, Dirty Mac N Cheese, Chopped Chicken Liver, Butcher Style Chicken Wings,  and all three of the desserts, Bag of Donut Holes, Banana Pudding, and the Loaded S'mores Nachos.  14 dishes, with 2 orders of each one, came to $231 and change.

Highlights for me:
I loved the biscuits--the honey salt butter accompanying them is wonderful.  I must get my own order next time because I only had a small piece since we were sharing.
I am also a fan of the pimento cheese, something I haven't had since I was a little girl in the Dark Ages.  This is a generous serving, literally a jar of pimento, so when you run out of crackers and pretzel chips, just ask the friendly servers for more.   I ate a lot of this! 
The mac n cheese with burnt pork ends is a good version that I'd have again, as well as the figs with goat cheese, pistachio, and pomegranate seeds.  Of the three desserts, I liked the donuts the best, but that's only because I'm not a big fan of the other two desserts offered, in general.  And, the donuts are served up warm with cinnamon sugar, my favorite; I'd love them even more with chocolate sauce instead of the berry one that they came with!
Service was excellent from start to finish and Chef Kim Canteenwalla made it a point to visit our table more than once, as well as the other diners in the restaurant.

Open Wed-Sun, 11:30am - 11:00pm
Monday and Tuesday, 4:00pm-11:00pm
Happy Hour,  4:00pm-6:00pm, Monday through Friday.
Welcome to Tivoli Village, MadeLV; I think you'll be making more fans along the way."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and menu was very creative. Service was great. But it's SOOOO NOISY.  There's not a thing inside the restaurant to absorb any noise. Very loud and in my opinion, the wrong music choice altogether for dinner."}
{"text":"Gr8 food pulls this place to a 5.  Service is good.  Ambience is nice.  Superior bar.   I like the prime rib, chicken salad, eggplant Reuben, appetizers, desserts and specials,   Not cheap but in Tivoli Village.  Happy hour deals.  Same quality as Honey Salt."}
{"text":"3.5 stars...but the system won't allow for the half star.

It is a nice space...our server was friendly and very attentive. 

The food was average to better than average, but nothing that wowed us..

We had the figs which were tasty....split a hamburger which didn't seem to be consistent with the name..it wasn't massive..the fries were skinny fries and I prefer steak fries..

For dessert we had the donut holes...the dipping sauce was very good...without it the donut holes were just average.

We will come back and try other things..watch some sports and such."}
{"text":"The food is upscale,  inventive,  bar food. The BBQ pork sandwich was good. The BBQ sauce is vinager based and the pork is roasted on site. The sweet potatoe fries were good but average. Teya, my server, was very knowledgeable on the food prep as well as the many draft offerings. Hopefully this place makes it in this restaurant black hole location."}
{"text":"Came here for Brunch and had a GREAT time.  I've been here before throughout the week nights and I must say this place has stayed consistent with their fantastic, attentive service (and YUMMY food).  We love coming here, and recently tried the brunch menu- so yummy, great prices and sitting on the patio was fun! Definitely coming back here and very happy with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Another place I wanted to check out. Rolled in about 1245pm on a Saturday afternoon, place was fairly empty. Maybe 20 tables or spots at the bar filled. I sat down at the bar and was quickly greeted by Dave the bartender. Dave was really nice, provided great service and makes a strong Bloody Mary. 
I went with the Dirty Mac and Cheese plus bacon cheddar biscuits. My heart is not happy with me but my stomach was. Both were very tasty. $7 for the Dirty Mac is a good price for a decent portion that filled me up. Bloody Mary was $8 which seems a bit steep, but then again its Tivoli Square where nothing is cheap.
I was looking for a decent place to watch games. This didn't fulfill the bill as they only have a few TV's and it can be noisy.Definitely they focus on food.
I might stop by again and try a bbq pork pulled sandwich. No real breakfast foods as they open at 1130am."}
{"text":"I'm no food snob, but I do enjoy dining experiences.  

After a night in Tivoli Village, we decided on this restaurant.  Yelp listed it as \"Hot and New\".  We definitely wanted to see what was good about this place.  

We ordered a bunch of dishes, to share, and we left wanting a little more.  Not in terms of being full, but in terms of being blown away by what we ate.  

 THE POSITIVES:
-Great drink selection!
-The dirty mac and cheese was wonderful.
-The nachos were delicious.
-The service and wait staff were attentive, cool and the manager delivered a re-fire on our clams.  

THE NEGATIVES:
- I ordered the steamed clams and the first order was way too salty.  The salty broth overpowered everything.  I also had a lot of grit between my teeth from those clams.  I'm not sure if they washed the clams, but it was a lot of sand.  I asked the waitress if she could get me a new order and she did.  The manager brought us the new dish and, yes, it was less salty, but the grit was still there.  At that point, I didn't feel like waiting and I didn't want to seem like that a**hole that is never satisfied.  It's a shame because i really wanted to enjoy that dish.

THE OKAYS:
-The artichoke was okay.
-The smoked onion dip was okay.
-The BBQ chicken wings were not great.
-The cheese fondue was okay.  I didn't mind the truffle oil, but my friend wasn't too crazy about it.  

OVERALL:
I should've gotten a burger or something more of a main course.  I can't say that this restaurant will be on my rotation of \"go to\" places to dine, but I'll probably give it another chance sometime down the road."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here last night for late night happy hour with a group of friends. Their happy hour menu is great, but I think their regular menu is reasonable also. The bartender was amazing!! He split our checks easily (which can always be a pain some places), he was really attentive, took multiple pictures for us, and was just all around awesome! We had a really great time and will definitely be back for happy hour again!

I've also come here a few times for brunch and the food is always great! Of course, bottomless mimosa's is a plus as well. Definitely one of my favorite spots to go."}
{"text":"Our first visit here.   Cool fun vibe...smaller than I expected though.  Service was attentive and friendly.

We shared the roasted figs with goat cheese.  I could eat that all day.  Nom nom nom!

Next we shared the double burger.  Very tasty and juicy meat.  We opted to leave it just the meat and cheese. It didn't need anything else.   Great bun too! 

Topped off the meal with the homemade donuts. The fresh berry dipping sauce made the dessert.  Raspberry BlackBerry reduced in fresh squeezed orange juice.  Very nice!

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"First, the special was not described to me correctly. It was covered in onions and peppers, which was not mentioned by the waitress. The could not remake without onions and peppers, so I asked for the BBQ Pulled Pork. It was plain...it tasted like pan fried pork on a bun.

It was also expensive. $65 for 3 people for lunch, and they didn't give us a break for the special not being described correctly. Too bad, I wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Fall weather calls for fabulous patio work lunches.

We arrived before the lunch rush and were seated out on the patio. They have a lot of great options, so we decided to share a number of items and we couldn't resist dessert.

We had the baked artichoke, mussels, corn and shrimp fritters, extra garlic bread to sop up all the rest of the juice from the mussels and we topped off our delicious lunch with freshly made doughnuts with raspberry dipping sauce.

Everything was great and I look forward to coming back to try the rest of their menu. I highly recommend the mussels and baked artichoke. Service was great and refills were plentiful. 

I haven't been to Tivoli very often, but with places like Made LV, I'm willing to explore Tovoli a little more often."}
