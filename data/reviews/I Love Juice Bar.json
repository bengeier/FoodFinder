{"text":"This place is good it isn't juice press like in NYC but its just perfect. I love the Pineapple green, orange you glad, and we got the beet"}
{"text":"Amazing service-- best tasting juice in the city! The best juice is amazing-- recommend the slim & sassy shot!"}
{"text":"I do LOVE Juice Bar but after my pick-up today I don't LOVE this location. I've been to this location a total of three times. The first time was smooth, the second time was nice the staff the energy the music all A-plus & the last visit which was today I didn't have a great experience.  If I would've written this review from visit 1 or 2 I would've gave 5 stars (4 and 3/4) but this is why I try to visit businesses at least twice before reviewing to determine consistency.   I really wish I'd followed my first mind and ordered my juice cleanse from the Park Road location where we met the co-owner Jenny Adams during our Yin and Juice Yelp event. I ordered the essential cleanse online this morning for pick-up this afternoon (Tuesday April 25,2016) and paid in full online for 12 jars (2 day cleanse).  I walked into the juice bar and the female cashier was cleaning with her back turned away from the register and the male was cleaning facing the register or shall I say door where customers enter. BOTH didn't acknowledge me entering the establishment with my son in hand. I stood there and glazed over the menu above for a minute or two. Still nothing, no HELLO no WELCOME to JUICE BAR, no nothing. Being pressed for time I decided to come closer and enter my phone number to check in. After doing so the female walked over and just stared. I went on to give eye contact and again nothing, so I took it upon myself to start the dialogue. I said \"HELLO, I would like to pick up my cleanse\" she replied by asking my name which I supplied and she walked away to grab it.  *KEEP IN MIND, I have a little one in my hand and not one of the staff members offered to help me as the store wasn't busy AT ALL I was the only person outside of two teens who were hanging out talking at a table.* She returned and placed the case of mason jars filled with juice on the counter and asked if I wanted anything else. I said Yes and ordered a Mean Green for my son and I. I paid and informed her that I would go try to take the jars to the car and come back for the to go juice she was making. I came back and it was just sitting on the counter unattended and she was nowhere to be found nor the male. I mean REALLY.   Now AGAIN I Love Juice but this location is a NO GO for me from now on. I didn't get any guidance on my juice cleanse no nothing. I asked if the jars were marked and she slid a brochure in my box and kept it moving. I mean this was such bad customer service PERIOD. I would give the. 1 star but I do like Jenny and I had better experiences my first two visits here which were both staffed with different staff. Plus I do LOVE juice so here you go 3stars at a potential 5 star all because two bad apples on a bad day I guess."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about I Love Juice Bar is that menu size is small enough where you aren't overwhelmed by the number of options available. I got a Very Strawberry smoothie and subbed out the banana for pineapple, which they were willing to do for no extra charge. The smoothie was so good compared to Jamba Juice, where the smoothies and juices taste very artificial and sugary. My friend and I visited Charlotte and found I Love Juice Bar on Yelp and were really happy with what we both ordered. I think he ordered the Berry Good Smoothie and subbed blueberry for mango and also ordered a wheatgrass shot. The employees behind the counter were also really nice and helpful since we were visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"I love their green smoothie! It isn't \"grassy\" like most other smoothies I've had. It's clean and the staff seems nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Expensive. Trendy. I've found bigger better açaí bowls with real fruit rather than some of the frozen packaged things that they have here and were 5 bucks cheaper than here. Large juices are like $13. Even back in LA I had a juicery that had $9-11 juices. I'm good. Oh plus customer service stinks, only had this one African American dude who took care of me. The 3 times I've gone, there were pretty faces male and female who were just all a bit ditzy and didn't pay attention to their customers. Don't like the vibe, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Wish I got the girl's name checking me out but she was very helpful! Been feeling a little under the weather so she suggested \"The Doc\" with a sniffle stopper shot and I was feeling great by the end of the day!"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, my favorite place for healthy juices and smoothies in Charlotte. Darn you, Juice Bar, and you $10 smoothies that I crave constantly! They also carry an assortment of carefully selected healthy snacks. I can't turn those down, either. (But they're healthy, right??? So you don't have to count the calories?)  I'm so excited another location just opened near my home.   Oh, and try the ginger/cayenne shot while you wait for your juice or smoothie. It will make your head buzz and your tummy smile. (Seriously, I felt like I had taken a shot of vodka!)"}
{"text":"My favorite smoothie/juice spot! The staff is phenomenal, always very friendly and attentive. Prices are a little more than what I wish they were, but I keep coming back. The combination of a great staff and great drinks is rare."}
{"text":"I normally juice and make smoothies at my home, but when I'm I'm out and around town I will come here to get a juice. My favorite one is the ginger greens, and I will normally add beets to it. I have only gotten juices from here, never smoothies. I am sure that the quality and flavor will be the same. They also carry snacks and pre-made food items that are good for being on the go and still watching what you eat. If you want more than a cup of juice, they offered cleanse packages and Growler fill-ups. The staff is always very friendly and there is even a rewards program. Every 10 visits you get a free juice or smoothie. Just into your telephone number at the register to get started."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. The girl at the front was so bright and happy, I'm sure she brightens everyone's day who come in here. None of the staff minded that I stayed for hours working on my tablet using their wifi, and the juice was fantastic! Great place!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and had not yet tried any other locations.  The staff is ok, not overly friendly or outgoing-kind of just \"there\".  They will talk if spoken to or do their best to answer questions.  I wish they would be a little more warm.  I usually go at lunch time and it is never overly crowded and wait time is minimal.    The juices and smoothies are always good.  I am glad that I discovered this place because I have a difficult time incorporating fruits and vegetable into my diet.  The juice helps me get some nutrients I would normally miss out on.  There is not one drink I haven't liked.  I really enjoy mean greens, add garlic-but it is extremely spicy!  Overall, the experience here has been fine.  I had to do my own research on the place and nutrition of the juices because the staff doesn't' t want to talk too much-but that's ok.  I have never had a bad visit."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Went in today for the first time and ordered the PB&J smoothie. Delicious! Super friendly staff. Brett and Bruce were great! Thanks for the recommendation! See you soon!"}
{"text":"You guys are really doing a great job. I love the variety of juice/smoothies/yummy food you offer. Thank you for the impeccable customer service. You are remarkable."}
