{"text":"watch what you put in your mouth from this place.  Breakfast burritos with MOLD on the tortilla....will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I have ever had outside of my house. You won't go wrong with anything, everything is so so good and the prices are reasonable. They also make your tacos and burritos how ever you want you can add anything. So good if you're close by you must try them out."}
{"text":"This place used to be absolutely amazing. The prices weren't so bad, and the food was delicious.Fast forward to today, and the prices have skyrocketed, the quality of the food has diminished, and the portions are as they're on a budget. My family and I were longtime regulars, and the original crew knew us by name. We used to frequent the place because the food was stellar. Sadly, today will be the last time I ever stop by. Our order was made incorrectly, and tasted very bland at that! Farewell Mr. Leno, only the nostalgia of better times will be missed."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I decided I would try this place out I'm glad I did. I had the Asada burrito which was very good. my wife had a green pork burrito and she really loved it. we like the place  so much that we went twice in one week!! great job Mr. Lenos. We will definitely be back and recommended it."}
{"text":"This place has terrific food! We always make it a point to come here while in Phoenix. It's clean inside and they always have a big screen playing fun movies.  Today I had Chile Rellano plate and chicken taco. Hubby had 2 beef burritos.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Good spot,  def not your average \"bertos\" taco shop.  Food tastes as it should and not off the assembly line.  Had a half order of super nachos, more than enough for one person... could even share with two people.  Carne asada tasted like it was right off the grill.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was on a business trip in Tolleson and had the munchies for some Mexican food and this place delivered. Now it's not like AMAZING but it was very good. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans and wow, those were some goood enchiladas, some of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Alright, first off I have not been to this establishment. However, I am from Lincoln Nebraska, where I lived a few blocks from Mr Lenos (Same People). I am going so far as to write this review because the food that I had on a very regular basis (at least twice a week) was so consistently good. From the chile rellenos to my favorite fish burrito, this place does it. I do plan on getting to this location and updating this review soon. My only issue is driving from Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I'm an East Side kind of guy and am one of those people who cross 1-17 maybe 3 or 4 times a year aside from a California road trip. I was tasked with finding some breakfast burrios for about 12 people on a Saturday morning at Westgate and Mr. Leno was the closest place that had good reviews, so I went way out of the way to try these guys out and take a risk, but Yelp has never steered me wrong! 

They were open early on a Saturday so that was a good sign, and they had a few breakfast burritos to chose from, also a good sign. Ordered a few different types including a non meat one for a veggie loving friend. While the cooks were building my burritos I took to the fresh salsa bar and loaded up on what I thought was a bunch of mild and medium salsas for everyone. Turns out everyone thought they were spicy which is perfect for me! 

Well I came back, everyone expected some Wendy's bs, but I handed them a Yelp sourced burrito that everyone loved. Almost everyone wanted to know where they came from and all thought it tasted great. 

So there you have it folks, if your in a 5-8 mile distance from this place, craving Mexican food and Mr Leno pops up, give it a go because chances are you won't find anything else this good without driving another 20 minutes. 

As far as interior, it's your typical taco shop, don't bring your date here, grab your date some food here and watch a netflix movie at home!"}
{"text":"The food is not that good! I had the cheese enchiladas and the rice and beans and it was just \"normal\"! I am 100% sure I could cook better! that's not a good thing!"}
{"text":"Random Mexican food place that's pretty decent.  My Australian friend and I were in Phoenix for a night during our 2 week road trip.  This place got recommended to us by the hotel guy based on pure proximity, but also for being pretty good.  Despite some semi-shady characters chillin' out front, the place was neat and clean.  The staff was friendly.  The food was also fairly decent.  We tried the shredded beef that this region is famous for, and felt sort of so-so on it.  You can probably find better shredded beef tacos around the Phoenix/Tucson area, but these were not bad by any stretch of the imagination.  We also got some al pastor tacos, which were pretty solid.  All in all, a good experience, and while I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this place, I definitely wouldn't avoid it either.  If I ever find myself there again, I'll grab a taco or 2..."}
{"text":"Found this on yelp and decided to give it a try. The cashier was great and very patient while we asked lots of questions. My husband got #5 machaca burrito with an adobada taco and I got a carne asada quesadilla..... YUM!! We really enjoyed our lunch!!! As you can tell in my pic.. LOL"}
{"text":"Just go across the street to Tacos La Lomita, just go! The tacos aren't that good.

This is the typical so-called \"mexican\" food place that appeals to the white customer first. This is not real mexican food!!!! It comes to show that people will eat just anything."}
{"text":"I've been at a local hotel for work for over a week, and was pleasantly surprised to find I had a mexican restaurant right next door.  The staff is generally very friendly, and food is fresh made on the griddle in the back. The burritos are very large, and for only a few dollars you can get a large breakfast burrito and a cup of hot coffee.  My favorite items are the adobada, aguas frescas (jamaica, horchata and tamarindo), and chorizo con huevoes breakfast burritos.  They serve menudo on weekends only, and while I haven't tried it yet it seems to be very popular.  Its the red chili version, not the white.

In short, this isn't a bad little place to stop in if you're in town. They are far from the best mexican I have had (but I do live on the border in Laredo, TX!), but Mr Lenos satisfies my cravings well enough when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite spots. Not anymore. Came in today because we were in the neighborhood. Ordered 3 shredded beef tacos, first order came out with flavorless and dry meat. Asked for replacement, still flavorless (not quite as dry), but shell was undercooked. Left disappointed, to say the least."}
{"text":"Good food but small portions for Carne asada fries especially for the price.  Nice service though and clean inside."}
{"text":"This is the greatest mexican fast food ive had since living back in san diego, ca. Staff is always friendly. there good, fast, and tasty."}
{"text":"Best west side late night eats.so far every time we come here everything has been good .no complaints here .and the menudo is really good."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews here you would think you're going to be blown away by something that would make you want to come back.

Don't get your hopes up.  For the prices here you can go to any federicos and get twice the amount of food.

No mini/street tacos....  Got the carne asada and chicken tacos and neither were great just bland fast food.

The hot sauce is actually hot though, I guess if you paralyze your tongue enough with that you don't notice the bland food.

Just ok."}
{"text":"Had ceviche and fish tacos. Fish tacos were so good i went back for more. Prices our a little high."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. I go every time I crave some great authentic Mexican food. My favorite choice is the rolled tacos with cheese, rice, and beans. I love this place!:)"}
{"text":"Average Fare

I came across Mr Leno Mexican Food while looking for another Mexican restaurant, and decided to give it a try based on ratings. Initially, I was just a little taken aback, because there were less than 3 people total dining during the dinner hour. 

Portions were very generous and the food was the average \"fast food\" Mexican fare. Leno's might not be one of my favorite eating establishments but the food is reasonably priced and as I mentioned the serving sizes are very generous.

Leno's has a  small condiment bar. I really enjoyed the salsa bar with all the different types of salsa's and hot carrots.  The tacos I ordered were  good, however, nothing that stood out. 

Leno's offers a variety of entr√©es to order from and the customer service is good.  No pretense just come in, order, sit down, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Sorry but I think $15.00 for enchiladas, a taco and drink is just a little steep. Let's consider the neighborhood (be sure to pack your kevlar vest and your \"9\") and also what it is. It's a drive thru Mexican food place. Don't get me wrong, I've had far worse (Filibertos) but I've also had better too. I have ordered a few different things and will continue to frequent this place hoping to hit the sweet spot but for now, it's just hits the spot."}
{"text":"Best Asada fries ever! Crinkle cut heaven! Plus it's open late. Don't forget the green chile"}
{"text":"I come here all the time with my friends, usually after a night out at around 2-3am. The food is good. Drive thru can be a little slow, but it's worth the wait. Customer service could definitely be improved during late/early hours though --cashier usually has a 'tude."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm getting nostalgic because I'm leaving this neighborhood in a few months and this will no longer be my local Mexican fast food, but Mr. Leno's will be my first real Yelp review.

The food is what you would expect. I've rarely ordered anything other than a burrito, of which there is an extensive list. My absolute favorite any time of day is the breakfast burrito, which has ham and fresh pico de gallo. But my husband regularly orders the California burrito, which he enjoys. The tortillas are not the best, but they get the job done.

We usually go through the drive-thru (it's 24-hours BTW),  but if you eat in, they do have a salsa bar with more selections available than the red and green hot sauces offered in the drive-thru. Another reviewer mentioned the salsa being too mild. I respectfully disagree. In the two years I've been coming here, it went from being a true \"red sauce\" to an orange-colored habanero red sauce which could be perfect OR way too hot. On my most recent visit, the sauce was different again, more smokey and peppery.

One of the best things about Mr. Leno's is that the food is not overly greasy. If I ever try similar restaurants, I usually end up with bad heartburn, which is not the case here. Worth a visit (or several)!"}
{"text":"Came here and sat in the drive thru for way too long, so drive up to the window thinking some would see us and help. Well someone saw us, but quickly walked away and never came up to the window. Needles to say, we drove off without food. Good thing too, we found some great food at La Pasadita Hot Dogs!"}
{"text":"Great place to take people at 2am food cravings, especially when you are the designated driver and need to sober up friends after a night at the bar. Great Mexican food place on this side of town at late hours. Carne Asada fries are the best hands down. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant food is so  good and the customer service is excellent I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So I went to Mr. Leno today because I've been craving tacos, good tacos.  Craving has been feed.  First let me state that the service was friendly and fast.  I got the rolled beef tacos due to someone else review pic and a chicken taco.  Needless to say I bite off more then I could chew literally.  The chicken taco alone was huge.  It was filled with nicely seasoned chicken, a mound of cheese and fresh lettuce.  I can't believe it only cost $2 for this monster taco; make sure you tip well when you order this because you're getting a steal.  
The salsa was delish as well as the rolled taco with guacamole.  I stated taco was good instead of tacos because I could only eat one after the chicken taco.
I will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Went here with my mom last Saturday night.  Just your standard taco shop.  But this one is actually clean.  Including the bathrooms!!!  

Had the adobada plate.  Decently seasoned.  The tortillas were a little dry though.  

All in all...No too shabby."}
{"text":"One-of-a-kind little Mexican restaurant that distinguishes itself from the others? Yes, I'm in!

Things they are good at: 

-Knowing how to actually season their food and cook it correctly. No one likes carne asada that looks and tastes like it was fished out of an old stew (I'm looking at YOU, Filiberto's). Great seasoning, clearly finished on a grill

Things they are bad at:

-Making horchata, which is just too sweet. 

-Portion sizes are skimpy compared to competitors. I mean, it was still enough, but I suppose I'm spoiled now and used to gargantuan burritos and whatnot

-Salsa is good, but I disappointingly mild

It's not blowing my mind, but better than a lot of stuff in the area."}
{"text":"Average food!! I ordered the chicken taco enchilada plate it was good but nothing special!! My husband ordered the Carne Asada burrito he said it was pretty good!!! Not a bad place to eat!! I want to try the fish tacos next!!"}
{"text":"Good food, the rolled tacos are the best, good service and are very fast.  The menudo should be more consistent."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in the area. Tucked away hard to find but worth it. Breakfast burritos!!! Love them."}
{"text":"Tried the carne asada burrito which was really good but the carne asada taco...was not impressed...for one taco almost the same price of the burrito. The salsa was really good which is always a good sign...can't have good Mexican Food with out good salsa."}
{"text":"I came across this place last week and this is already my third time back! The food is amazing! And the service is really great. I love when people are so sweet and provide the customer service everyone should receive. Love the chorizo con carne burritos :)"}
{"text":"I found Mr Leno's on yelp,looking for menudo for my husband. It was very close to us and I'm so glad we tried them. The staff was friendly and nice. It was clean and they had a nice variety on the menu.  My husband had the menudo which he really liked. I tried the steak rancheros breakfast plate. It was very tasty. 
Their drive through is open 24 hrs so I'm sure I'll be back soon. Great little treasure of a place."}
{"text":"Don't waste your hard earned money fellow Yelpers.
Flavorless, dry, bland food. $18.00 for a Carne  plate with beans n rice plus 2 tacos."}
