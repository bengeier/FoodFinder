{"text":"We got the corned beef sandwich and the banquet burger. Both were very good. It came to $23 with a side fry and gravy, so not a bad price. Friendly and speedy customer service. Just make sure you call ahead cause they seem to be closed during their posted open hours a lot."}
{"text":"First time there today, Ordered the Dandy Andy and it was made to order and dressed in front of me. Great service, nice people and the interior was appealing. Would recommend to Deli Lovers."}
{"text":"Never open during their posted hours. Even their posted hours are limiting the customers to when they can come in. How are you closed during the weekends and only open during work hours?"}
{"text":"I admit, I was a little skeptical walking into Smokey Jo's.  A deli in West Rouge?  Hmm....  Well, I'm happy to say, SJ proved me wrong.  I picked up the daily special pulled pork sandwich (I know, not so deli-ish) with fries and a Montreal smoked meat sandwich with spicy mustard on rye.  Both were well executed with the pulled pork sandwich being slightly more satisfying in terms of flavour balance.  The Montreal smoked meat was good except there was wayyyyy too much spicy mustard and the smoked meat itself was super salty.  Not sure if they make their own smoked meat here but for those watching their salt intake should stay away from this sandwich.  And I loved the idea of individually packaged pickle but again, the pickle was way too salty and mushy (beyond full sour).  Their coleslaw was slightly better but liberal use of salt in their food left me guzzling water for rest of the day.  As far as I could see, there was nothing special about their bagel selection which was limited to 4-5 varieties.  The same goes for their cream cheese selection.  I think I would drive the extra distance to What a bagel for my bagel cravings for now.    I may try Smokey Jo's again for different offerings.  Will keep Yelp posted."}
