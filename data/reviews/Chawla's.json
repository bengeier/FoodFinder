{"text":"Creamy chicken to malai kofta, they use different gravy's, unlike other restaurants.

Small plans with a capacity to serve 20-25 people.
Food is served fresh and it's delicious, Naans are soft even on the next day.

Definite recommendation for the authentic exotic Indian cuisine lovers."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant but food was good and fresh. I ordered garlic naan with malai kofta which you could taste was fresh. However the service sucks. The girls working there just stand there watching the Indian dramas on tv and pay less attention to their customers. For that reason I give 4 stars."}
{"text":"I just visited the place today, the place is very small so don't expect to find a table to eat there, you will have to take out. I tried their sheik kabab as an appetizer, I was expecting something dry and crispy, it turns out to be more of something steamed, and I ordered a chicken tikka masala it was suppose to be spicy, but I found it really sweet and lastly the chicken biryani, that was actually very tasty."}
{"text":"3.5 stars
Ambience - This place is very ordinary ambience wise. It's located in a strip mall. It has 4-5 tables with a capacity to seat 20 people. This is more of a takeout joint than an eat-in restaurant.

Food - Heard a lot about Chawla's from our friends. We drove from North York to try the food here. We tried their Butter Chicken, Kadai Paneer, Dal Makhani and their breads.
The Butter Chicken was pretty good. Dal Makhani was okay. Paneer we didn't like at all.
Overall it was okay. Will try the Biryani, Momos and Chowmein next time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to eat. I love their creamy chicken, it's honestly one of the tastiest things I have ever tried. Their naan is always perfect as well. 

Personally I like it better for take out since we have had rude experiences in the past from people that work there and even dirty looks from other customers. I'm not sure if it was due to race or if my husband and I were eating the food differently - but there was some obvious lack of care for us than the other patrons there. 

I do still order this for take out though. Great portion sizes, very tasty and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very good food, but not quite good enough to justify the price(10-15$ for entrees, rice and naan not included). My group tried a few different dishes - vegetarian, chicken, and goat. I will say that all the meats were amazingly tender and good. However the one dish we ordered mild (goat bhatura) was the only spicy dish! Everything we ordered spicy came out mild! It was still tasty enough that we did not find cause to complain. 

Not bad at all, but Brampton has so many Indian options that I am going to keep looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"I hired them for my wedding catering. They are very accommodating and provided me with great suggestion based on my venue and guests. Most importantly, their food tasted amazing!!!! Our guests didn't stop talking about how good the food was. They use quality ingredients and cooked to perfection.

I highly recommend Chawla's Chicken!!"}
{"text":"If 0 stars was an option, this restaurant would get it.      Above all things, customer service is critical and in a service based industry, if you do not have customer service, then you might as well close your business.

Mango lasi was spilled all over my wife's shirt, pants and phone by the waiter.  So they took the lasi off the bill...are you kidding me?  

A request to speak to the Manager delivered an obnoxious man who started to berate our party and cause a scene following an arduous negotiation of 50% off the bill.   That was after offering $4 to pay for dry cleaning...are we in the 1960's?

Time to get back to the basics Chawla...customer service.  In the words of Gordon Ramsay, \"Bye Bye Botox\"!"}
{"text":"Cream Chicken is well known in the Western World.
From the pedestrian Campbell's to classic Bechamel.
It was more than interesting to find an Indian inspired.

A well franchised Indian brand landing in Brampton.
Not a bad place to dine by any means but be patient.
Takes time to freshly prepare the Food as noted.

Chawla Cream Chicken is the obvious choice to explore here.
I expected lots for the price point but not as impressed in the end.
I was lucky to get Naan complimentary on Weekdays(Mon-Thu).
I tried not to think about Campbell's Cream Soups too much.
But at the end it's only different by \"      \" that much unfortunately.

Hyderabadi Goat Biryani($11.99) wasn't half bad.
Just got it to have something additional and filling.
Yeah, it looks different served with Jap-style plastic Boat dish.
That's what I call new fusion and inspiring.

{1} Not to be taken too seriously, just a fun concept(Face-off dishes)."}
{"text":"Food is amazing... typical Delhi  taste but for some reason even if u eat like 1 naan n dal u feel heavy for quite some time...  so until I find the reason m still going to enjoy the food.."}
{"text":"Great Indian take away good .
Master in butter chicken , prices on steeper side though .
While waiting one day I tried chicken Momo's ( Dimsums) ... they were WOW !
But prices pinch !
Good for catering u guess !"}
{"text":"The food is good and not too pricey. Some of the must try dishes are chicken,goat biriyani and paneer lababdar.

They make really spicey food, so don't forget to mention your preference when you place an order. 

I haven't had an opportunity of dine-in, so can't really comment on service."}
{"text":"Not to be overlooked. 
We ordered once in past and food was just okay but I believe there is new Management now and food has been very good each time we order! Try the butter chicken and butter naan or the aloo gobhi (prob spelled wrong but it's the cauliflower with potatoes and spices. It all tastes so heavenly.
Sorry had to change my review as my last order of aloo gobhi had a small, long piece of plastic in it. This is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Everything today was worst at its best. Right from the table seating to ordering to wrong items delivered at the table plus the servers wrong attitude to all the worst experiences. Never coming back and will suggest to all the yelpers and my friends that when new restaurants open like Chawla's, they're good in the beginning but later when they make big they follow the same suit as other restaurants. Poor service, poor food. Not coming back ever and urge anyone reading this review to go elsewhere. Thanks."}
{"text":"Negative on cream chicken. Chawla's, is a franchise restaurant that is known for its signature dish called cream chicken. Anyone who has ever had cream chicken at one of the AUTHENTIC Chawla's can tell how good it tastes. We just grabbed two orders of cream chicken to go tonight. Sad to say but their chicken doesn't taste like the Chawla's original cream chicken at all.  When you go to a franchise restaurant  to check out their signature dish and you get what I want is disappointing."}
{"text":"I go to this place for their cream chicken and love it. Chawla's cream chicken taste is still intact after so many years. In fact, it reminds me of my college days when we all friends used to go to Chawla's in Delhi. I won't say that everybody will love Chawla's recipes but i am sure the one who ised to like Chawla's back in India would love it here too. I would love to visit again and again."}
{"text":"The meat here is not halal. Too bad because it looks like they have a lot of tasty dishes on the menu. Owner should consider making it halal.

I had the Mattar Paneer. It was really good. You get a big portion.

I gave three stars instead of 4 or 5 because their prices are too high.  Its $3.49 for ONE garlic naan?  Thats ridiculous. And the amount of naan and taste does not justify the price. 

Because of the cost of food here, I won't be returning unless I go and buy my garlic naan from another shop. But who is gonna do that?"}
{"text":"We came all the way to Chawla's in Brampton to try out their Cream Chicken.

\"Chawla's special Cream Chicken started in Nainital in the 1960 when late Sardar Attar Singh Chawla father of D.S. Chawla, Tajinder Chawla & I.P.S. Chawla, dished out his very own \"Kali Mirch Ka Chicken\", which instantly became a favourite with all. The family then improvised on the basics, adding another spice here and a little more pepper there and thus was born the Cream Chicken.\"

Cream Chicken took 15 minutes to cook as at Chawla's everything are cooked when order. CP 24 did keep my Yelp Friend entertained while I looked at the washroom door....

How's the famous Cream Chicken?? Remind me on Cream of Chicken Soup garnished with black pepper and herbs! Chicken was really moist and with a great texture. It tasted pretty good with the naan though! 

Until.... I saw the price tag.... $14.99?! That's quite pricey for that few piece of chicken......$14.99?

My Yelp Friend was giving me this look when he ordered Hyderabadi Goat Biryani ($11.99). I think I started to like eating goat/lamb if they are prepared properly. The goat inside the biryani was tender and flavoured and not gamey at all. But not being gamey might not be a good thing??

Naan is complimentary on weekdays (Mon-Thu). Garlic Naan was crisp, light and not doughy, more like a flat bread.

Chawla's is a really small restaurant with full capacity at around 20 patrons. There were more people ordering takeout than eating in. 10% discount if for takeout orders, but call ahead since it takes a long time for your order to be ready!"}
{"text":"Visited on 6th Aug night and I noticed few uncommon events that one expects in a typical Indian restaurant. Here are my observations and you can make your own judgement - 

1. Due to long weekend, Chawla's were short staffed and were completely taken aback with the amount of crowd Vs. Staff in Kitchen and waiters attending customers. 

2. The Manager Lady seemed severely stressed and was being verbally abused by angry customers who had to wait for probably longer (45 mins) as opposed to 30 mins that was promised. The manager was clearly being the victim by many angry customers. My humble suggestion to this manager is to give customers 50-60 mins wait when they inquire the estimated wait times, so the customers can make best use of their time. Also, be very firm with abusive customers. 

3. The food was make by a chef who was made by God's own hand (a pukka foodie reviewing :-)), especially the chicken biryani was the best I ever ate. I am going again today :-)

4. We waited for about 45-50 mins but looking at the abuse the manager and one other waitress were getting, we just decided to be patient. After tasting our food, we all unanimously decided that every second of our wait time was well worth. Personally, I would wait in line for an hour (hope it never happens) to eat at Chawla's.

5. Prices were very reasonable and the services, presentation and ambience were excellent. 

Management: Please order a sign board that says - \" We reserve the right to decline service to anyone we feel\".

I still can't forget that few customers were so foul mouthed and abused the poor manager lady that night. Manager was at a minor fault for giving a bit less wait time and I understand (being a customer and having my 5 year old on my lap all the time standing) but customers have no right to abuse. May be it's just a particular kind of people that think they can get rowdy but I am not used to seeing this back in California. I would have asked the people to back off v v firmly. 

Good luck, Chawla's"}
{"text":"Amazing food, very good portions and very reasonable. By far the best Indian food I've tried . Try the Nepali chicken Momos too . It's a small place but very good food"}
{"text":"My Canadian buddy had talked up this place, which is apparently a franchise based out of North India and caters to largely North Indian/Punjabi cuisine. Judging from the exterior you can be forgiven for skipping it as it is set between a dozen sidewalk stores in a corner strip mall next a small office building in a  corner. However the food is very good and does very well. We tried the Creamy Methi [fenugreek] Chicken, quite tasty along with garlic naan bread. We also asked for and got a huge portion of Hyderabad Goat Biryani [basmati rice & goat meat flavored with heavy spices and saffron, cooked with rich aromatic flavors, served with small side of whipped yogurt ]. That day was not at all crowded, it seems 90% of their business is carry out (aka take way)! However another lass who had a large order of 6+ Chicken Momos convinced us to give it a try. We asked for a sample of the dipping sauce - which was quite tangy and had garlic, ginger,tomato sauce, made it quite tarty, worth it. The Chicken Momos are an Indian equivalent of Chinese pot stickers, except the internal filling is made from minced chicken, marinated and is not pan seared, rather steamed. Credit to the staff who are all Nepali origin for doing good job (they seem to be on the cell phones all the time!)."}
