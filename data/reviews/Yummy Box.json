{"text":"Really authentic Taiwanese food. It's hasn't been a place like this in Vegas for a while. If you want to try or missing Taiwanese style food this is the place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice little spot right smack in the middle of Chinatown on Spring Mountain. Very clean little place, service was prompt. Menu is simple and reasonable with some breakfast items, box style entrees and a pretty good list of appetizers. 

We tried the salt and pepper chicken, pork belly and a very good Duroc pork chop. The rice is cooked perfectly and everything was fresh. Washed it all down with a fresh watermelon juice. I would recommend!"}

{"text":"We came here looking for a good Chinese food place with soy milk and some other Chinese dishes but we were treated with store bought soy milk and they even lied saying it was mad fresh when we saw them pour it into our bowls"}
{"text":"For a town like Vegas where most restaurants have no incentive to perfect the quality nor the authenticity of their offerings. 'Yummy Box' is a rare exception for Taiwanese food.

Their menu is limited and mainly serve inexpensive lunch bentos and a few appetizers.   Nonetheless, their food is authentic and the items like the oyster omelet and the hot and sour soup were among the very best I've tried in both CA and NV."}
{"text":"Basil chicken was very flavorful. So much food for a good price and the workers were very friendly with a smile"}

I say this from the bottom of my heart,

If you're looking for \"traditional Taiwanese\" and if you have ultra sensitive taste buds I recommend #YummyBox. 

As you can see I've posted multiple photos through my visits at this adorable establishment, and I've finally gathered my observation to post this review for Yelpers across the globe. 

I've tried the Chicken Porridge with Mushroom in the morning with Radish Cake, that's my breakfast. 

During lunch, I love to devour Pork Belly & Bamboo along with either Chow Mein (super authentic street food flavor) or Fried Rice Noodle (like my mama's style). 

Hate to be a brat but I'm waiting for some more desserts to added into the menu, I do know the Aiyu Jelly with Lemon is straight from the fruit which is the ONLY one in Vegas. 

This is why I can strongly say, Yummy Box is Best Of Las Vegas!!! Yum Yummm"}
