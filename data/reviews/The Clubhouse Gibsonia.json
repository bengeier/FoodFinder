{"text":"I typically go to the clubhouse to get a drink after work or to grab a bite with some business colleagues. The food is pretty decent, but by no means nothing to write home about - don't expect anything you can't get at  Max and Erma's or even Eat N' Park. The bar is a social experience.  The crowd varies in age and can offer either a great or awful experience (when the college kids are all home or when the college kids are all gone, it can be an interesting experience. The drinks are reasonably priced and the staff is great.  Awesome for groups or catering - they have a huge party room that you can rent.   Overall, the Club House is a good place to go if you're looking for something simple and not much more."}
{"text":"This used to be one of the better places to go in gibsonia. The menu changes and staffing changed have hurt this place severely. I do like some of the recent renovations but each time I've been here since I've had rude and terrible service. I even watched a manager or owner cuss out his wait staff in the dining room while I was eating. Needless to say I haven't been back."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend. This was our 1st time there - its a nice place. Bar was recently renovated and looked good. They had 2 pool tables and darts in the bar area. There was a game room in the back like at Dave & Buster's or Jillian's, and a separate seating area. Food was slightly on the higher end for what your received - Meatball sandwich was 9 bucks but large. Got the Garlic Rolls and the stuffed hot pepper as an appetizer. The garlic rolls are essentially rolls covered in butter, garlic, and way way too much salt. The hot pepper was good and savory. I'm not sure if this place is related to North Park Lounge in Allison Park - (see my other review). The Allison Park location's garlic rolls are 100x better tasting. I'm sure I'll be back to the Clubhouse.  Additionally bought a six pack of miller lite there for $7.50, had a draft and that was kinda expensive at $3.50"}
{"text":"Went here while visiting my sister & her fiance for the holidays. This is their local spot and they go multiple times a week. Now I can see why: Clubhouse was great place to catch the pens/steelers, good draft list, big menu, and friendly service. Didn't get to check out the game room, but will next time. Thumbs up for the happy hour deal, too!"}
{"text":"3 Stars - food/atmosphere. There is nothing particularly exciting about the food offered by the Clubhouse. Some argue the wings are good or the fish sandwich. However I find the menu having too many selections.   3.5 Stars - The bar area. They have cleaned up the bar area with some new flat screen televisions however the last time I was there it was just awful to sit at the bar in a cloud of smoke. Yeah, the place reeks....   5 Stars - the Ranch Dressing...try it and you will see."}
{"text":"Your place might be beautiful, but your food sux.  Husband and I both ordered sausage stuffed peppers. They were totally different.  Both were terrible. Just because you put it on a fancy dish doesn't make it good. Been going here since the beginning and the food has gotten worse. You did away all of our favorites.  No problem with service.  That is why I gave it 2 stars."}
{"text":"We've been going to the Clubhouse for 15 years and usually had a good experience.  Last month I took my 11 year old there for his Birthday at his request. When we got there I spoke to the Manager and our waitress , informing them of the fact it was my Son's birthday . We ordered appetizers and our meals. 45 minutes later we got our meals, as we were finishing our meals the appetizers came. We waited 1 and a half hours for them to either sing to my son or bring the bill.  We asked to speak with the manager , nobody came over so we paid and left. Don't think we will return."}
{"text":"Amazing lounge fries! Friendly atmosphere. Good service. Great for family events or going to watch a game. I have gone there since grade school and highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Clubhouse doesn't bring anything innovative to the table, but they provide a fun atmosphere that everyone can have a good time at.  The food is standard but above-average pub/bar food and the portions are large.  One side is the dinning area, the other side the large arcade area, and there is a bar in the middle.  They have a lot of pool tables and dart boards if video games don't float your boat.  My family always has a good time at the Clubhouse."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible!  I have been going to the clubhouse since the first day they had opened. The original clubhouse was the place to bring your family and was very family oriented. I remember the deals given to MVP customers, the Wednesday all you can eat wing nights and the reasonable beer prices. After Gregg the owner died, the place fell apart. They eliminated the majority of the game rooms and expanded the bar area hoping to bring in a younger clientele. Furthermore, the menu had changed and they eliminated their classic cheese fries substituting with a crunchy french fries dish.  The taste of these fries are horrible!  The wife and I still remained loyal customers of our community and supported this business until 2015. We were watching a steeler game and ordered wings. The wings were served to us and they were raw inside and completely cold. We sent them back because the taste turned our stomachs. We requested the check and we were charged for the wings. The manager made us pay for raw wings. My wife and I decided that this was our last visit because the week prior, we paid 40 dollars for over cooked burned steaks.   Fast forward, today, two years later we decided to go back to see the live entertainment. What a mistake. I thought I was in a different time zone. The place was occupied by an older generation and the bar was staffed with one bartender and one server. The server was an older gentleman that had no personality. My son asked him questions about the craft beers and he could not answer his questions and seemed annoyed. My son is a server for another restaurant and was very offended with his demeanor.  He was not observant to our needs and it took forever for him to check on us. My wife did not have a drink the majority of her meal and she ordered iced tea. He walked past us numerous times while we sat and waited. We ordered wings. This was a huge mistake. They were cold internally but seemed like they were cooked and that is disgusting. We sent them back and they took the charge off the bill. The funny part is on the bill  there is a category titled unsatisfied customer. The wings were refunded there like a coupon. It is a shame that is a category they have to include based on their poor service.  I hope management reads my review because I rarely write one. Enough is enough and I was hopeful that after two years the clubhouse would get their act back together and listen to what the people are saying. Did you ever wonder why the place is half empty?  I remember this place being packed and waiting for a seat. I do not see the same spark as before when Greg was still alive. I know this service would be unacceptable to him and he would straighten this place out. Very very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR CHECK!  a few couples were sitting around a table in the bar having drinks and some food.  when we got our separate bills, there was 18% gratuity added to all our checks.  when we asked the waitress about it, her response was since we were all sitting together as a group they are suppose to charge us as a group.  as an alternative to this logic, we told her to tell her boss we could buy our drinks at the bar to get rid of the 18% which would by-pass her tip!  not really much she could say.  Very SLEEZY way of getting a double tip...since they don't tell you!"}
{"text":"I don't like like you... But I like you... Get what I'm saying??  The first time I attended the Clubhouse was for a baby shower. They have a great large event room that was perfect for the shower. The food was good and I had Pumpkin beer... Because nothing says \"yay you're having a baby!\" like drinking booze in front of them. Anyways...   The men that were banished to the bar seemed to have a great time and an even better time playing mega air hockey with the kids.   The second time I went for dinner, it was ehhh... Got the Mac n cheese bites which were tasty lil nuggets, especially because they were half off with Happy Hour. We enjoyed some beers from their decent draft list but the actual entrees were like Canada... Kinda boring.   Best thing we liked about this place was our totally rad server who even drew us a sweet cartoon \"thank you\" on the receipt. I would totally buy him a beer.  Overall, this is the place for you if you want a nice big sports bar for watching games and meeting up with people OR if you're a parent and you question where you went wrong in life, you can drink some beers while your kid plays Skee-ball."}
{"text":"We went to the Clubhouse for dinner tonight. The parking lot outside of the restaurant was full, so we assumed that there would be a wait to be seated. After parking in the lower lot and climbing nearly 30 steep steps in order to reach the restaurant, we were quite surprised to be seated immediately. Our server promptly approached our table and smiled as she told us about the happy hour specials, and offered us a beverage.   We ordered the cheese stuffed pretzel for our appetizer. The pretzel was hot and salted, but it had a minimal amount of cheese inside of it. It tasted fine, but it was nothing special. For dinner I had a Reuben sandwich that was served on marbled rye bread. It was prepared with lots of tender corned beef and tasted great. It was accompanied by a baked potato (my choice) and was served with two small butter pats. I requested additional butter from the server. She honored my request, but it took more than seven minutes to receive the extra butter. My husband ordered the breaded fish sandwich and was quite disappointed with his choice. The fish was lukewarm when served. The piece of fish was quite large, but it was awkwardly served open-faced on a hamburger bun! We had previously ordered this fish sandwich and it was served on a large hoagie roll. It was impossible to pick it up, so my husband had to eat it with a fork. The fish was served with warm, crispy fries.   The atmosphere is upbeat and the music is played at a high volume. Numerous TV's are placed on the walls throughout the dining room. An enclosed bar is located across from the dining room and a small arcade is located downstairs. Tonight the staff was pleasant and efficient, but the food was just okay."}
{"text":"Great burgers, wings and salads. The bar has a solid beer & liquor selection and it's my favorite place for watching games. There's also an arcade room and photobooth machine in the back."}
{"text":"The restaurant was stylist and clean and accommodating to my 3 children. The waitress was amazing and did a fanatic job Catering to all the kids whims. I ordered a shrimp poboy and it tasted similar to New Orleans (it's never the exact same as in New Orleans) but still delicious!  It's the closest thing to the real thing you are going to get around here. My husband ordered the brisket sandwich and he really liked it. He said it was a little dry it but was his fault for not asking for more sauce.  The appetizer was the highlight!!! We order these unique \"clubhouse cigars\" that I am going to be craving until the next time I get to eat them again. I will absolutely eat here again and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to use an Enjoy Book coupon - a great way to try new places! When we arrived, there was only room in the  bottom parking lot for us to park. We had no problem climbing the large flight of stars up to the restaurant, however, it would not be convenient for someone who cannot do stairs or who lacks endurance.   The inside of the restaurant was very open, with one side as the bar and the other side as the family style room. TV screens covered the walls with several sports options available for guests to watch. I browsed the menu and thought it looked very similar to that of North Park Lounge. My husband and I decided on the cheese stuffed pretzel and long and behold! It was the exact same as the appetizer we have had at NPL in the past! The appetizer was ok, as it was just a pretzel roll cut in half with shredded cheese in the center that was not melted the entire way through. I did enjoy the honey mustard dipping sauce that came with it.   For my meal, I settled on the Strawberry Feta Salad while my husband had the special, A BBQ Grilled Chicken Salad. My chicken and strawberries were good, I just did not find the salad to be anything spectacular, especially for the cost. It was a nice size, however a few more of the ingredients listed on the menu would have sufficed.   If you are looking for simple food to go along with your favorite sports team, it may be worth a shot. Decent happy hour special and someday, we may return to partake in it."}
{"text":"Having grown up in the area, I feel that when I go back to the Clubhouse, I am stepping back into my younger days.  The menu is basically the same, with a wide array of deep-fried appetizers and the same tasty Cajun Chicken Penne.    However, the restaurant has faded from what it was a decade ago, to nothing more than a glorified dive.  Keeping with the times, things were slowly eliminated.  The warm bread and herb butter with your meal, gone.  The MPV Club has been slowly stripped, and with the upcoming changes with soon be barely worth paying for.  Also gone is Customer Appreciation Week, a favorite of many people in the community.  Even the video games, which I have long since outgrown, are mostly the same ones from my childhood, without any concern for bringing in something new and exciting to babysit the children as the parents get smashed at the bar, or wait for the food (which seems to take forever.)  The food is okay, being large portions of uninspired food.  As mentioned prior, the Cajun Pasta is a standout, as is the BBQ Chicken Dip appetizer.  Overall, if you are craving good wings, but Quaker Steak is too far of a drive, the Clubhouse wins.  Just bring some earplugs, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere and a great time for the price. Kids have a blast on Tuesdays when the games are free while Mom and Dad enjoy each other's company. Plenty of TVs to watch the Pens or Steeler games."}
{"text":"Great place and great food!  Whether it's steak or a salad everything we've tried is good. Prices are reasonable and the service is great."}
{"text":"Love the concept that although happy hour ends at 7:00 the Miller Lite deal is in full effect.   Let the games begin"}
{"text":"I was not too satisfied with my recent visit to The Clubhouse. I have been here several times before but just this past week, I was disappointed with the service my party and I received. There were only three of us at our table- 2 of us ordered salads, and the other ordered a burger. Our meals took over 35 minutes to come, and when they did, I was less than impressed with my food. I ordered a salad which was served with chicken on top- the chicken was cold and rubbery, and my friend who ordered it as well said the same thing. Our waiter was very friendly, and apologized for the slow service, but even still we were very disappointed with the amount of time it took to deliver 2 salads and a burger!!!"}
{"text":"Prices are not the best.  Drink options are great.  Food is tasty but expensive.  Good place to watch a game."}
{"text":"At one point in time this place would have gotten 5 stars.  They have since \"changed\" the menu several times and remodeled.  The bar side of the remodeling looks really nice, but it's like they did that part, ran out of money and forgot about the restaurant area.  In addition their most recent menu change did not include any additions but they took several items off.  At this point, I'll go there for drinks or dessert to watch a game, but I'm not a fan of dining here anymore."}
{"text":"Like others, I've been going to the Clubhouse since I was younger. I like it because the menu hasn't changed .....and I dislike it because the menu hasn't changed! My favorites are still there (all of the appetizers) but they haven't brought anything new to the table, and they need to. Besides their apps, I wouldn't brag about the rest of the menu. However, they do have a friendly waitstaff and a great bar. The games are entertaining for children as well."}
{"text":"I'm not familiar with the \"old\" clubhouse, but I do enjoy coming here for a weeknight dinner or apps and drinks during a Pens game. The food and beer list are decent. You can pretty much find something you'd like on either menu. I've only ever sat on the renovated side and it's beautiful!   The one weekend evening I went for dinner, it was packed with families. Good atmosphere for a relaxed night out."}
{"text":"I have been to North Park Lounge many times, but this was my first time to The Clubhouse. As a family of six I was nervous about going to dinner on a Saturday night without a reservation, but we were seated at a booth immediately. The food was ok (a salad for me and a sandwich for my hubby), but the service was great and we received our food within 15 minutes which was amazing! After we were done we went to the arcade area - fun way to end a dinner out with the kids in one location. 3 stars due to the ok food - 4 stars for service."}
{"text":"The clubhouse has once again started to fall, and it is do to there menu changes. If the previous owner was still alive we would be seeing better service mixed w/ menus that actually work.  The beer lists are not the issue, but instead the appetizers which they were once known for. (they refuse to stick w/ something that works)  If you would like to visit one of the other \"North Park Lounges\" either in McCandless (8701 Babcock Blvd, Pittsburgh, PA 15237) or the one is Cranberry (20810 Rte 19, Cranberry Twp, PA 16066) they both still maintain better menus w/ appetizers that work."}
{"text":"Disgusting food. I came in for lunch. They were slow. The bartender was very nice and tools our orders quickly and made great cocktails. We placed our food order that took entirely too long to come out. I ordered a simple burger medium well and fries. The fries were nothing special. Hard to mess up deep frier fries. However, my burger was one of the worst I've ever ate. Ever. From the bun to the meat, I wanted to puke. The meat was totally black with crispy chucks that j can only assume came from a dirty nasty oven. The \"meat\" had a purple hint to it and I couldn't stomach anymore after two bites. If you're a manager and seeing this, fire the cooks from this day. If this was you, you're a joke. I hope the bartender finds a better job at another bar soon and I'll never return."}
{"text":"I'm familiar with the North Park Lounge, but I had never been to their other restaurant, the Clubhouse. They have the same good food and service. I think their fish sandwich is one of the best in Pittsburgh. I was disappointed in the fries, they were a bit soggy. The beer selection is very good. Everything is pretty typical bar food, cooked well."}
{"text":"I have been going to the North Park Clubhouse Lounge since I was in high school, and it's still as good as it has always been. Last night my friends and I stopped in there for dinner and drinks. We had a large group (12 of us), and they instantly accommodated us by pushing tables together in the bar area. They took our order quickly, and our food wasn't far behind. I ordered the Pittsburgh Wrap which is probably one of my favorite things to get when I go there.   If you're looking for a nice, laid back place to get some dinner, watch a game, catch up with friends over drinks, or bring the family for their gaming area, it is a perfect place for any of that. They also have a banquet room in the back perfect for bridal/baby showers or a party!  It's only 25 minutes Northeast of downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Recently I had my first visit to the Clubhouse post-renovation. The renovations are amazing, especially if you know what the place looked like before. They have a great seat yourself bar section with plenty of tables, and a wall of garage doors that they keep open during the summer months. There are also lots of TVs for those who want to watch a game. There's also a dining room side to the restaurant for those who don't want to be in a bar environment. The renovations there are also a welcome change.   As for the food, I wish we had a better experience. It might have just been what we ordered, but we ordered things that you shouldn't get wrong at this kind of establishment! I got a Pittsburgh Salad with buffalo chicken...a staple in the burgh! My biggest complaint was that it seemed like they used franks hot sauce instead of franks buffalo wing sauce. The hot sauce was so overwhelming that it was hard to enjoy, even after I dumped ranch all over. My husband got a blue cheese burger and he said he's had better. He let me have a bite and I thought it had very little flavor.   As an appetizer, we got fried pickles, and I'd say they were the best part of our meal. They were pickle spears dipped in batter and fried, served with a side of creamy horseradish sauce. Another great appetizer is the Lounge Fries. They are a giant mound of fries loaded up with cheese, bacon and served with a side of ranch. A heart attack on a platter, but so worth it!  Even though this visit was disappointing, we'll likely give the Clubhouse another try since it's such a staple to the North burbs."}
{"text":"Change is inevitable over time, but I don't feel that the Clubhouse's recent renovations and menu changes were for the better.  I've been coming to the Clubhouse since I was six years old, when it first opened, so it was a regular joint for my family growing up. I know it probably wasn't the cash cow of the place, but I was disheartened to see most of the arcade/games area wiped out for the new garage door-style bar. It's where I spent a lot of time as a kid, and now there are only a handful of games in the lower area. It almost seems misleading to still call it \"The Clubhouse\", you know?  Old standby favorites are still on the menu: Lounge fries, fish sandwich, chicken tortellini salad, but at elevated prices. The fish sandwich has gotten smaller, and the beer batter doesn't taste nearly as good as it once did.  On multiple occasions I've experienced slow, inattentive wait staff. I've been to the bar once or twice, and wasn't really impressed with the selection or the prices.  Overall, I understand that restaurants should evolve over time, but I felt like the missteps here have abandoned longtime, dedicated customers."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times over the years when it was part of the North Park Lounge family. I knew it had separated/divorced from that and had been remodeled so was curious (not anxious) to try it. I did the other day for lunch. A couple things to note. The parking lot is still atrocious. Narrow spaces, poor traffic flow, caved in pavement. Not good. The inside looks better, not like the budget version of Dave and Busters that it used to be. But what about the food you ask? Yeah, about that. I had a stomach ache one hour after eating there. Coincidence? Don't think so.   Sure, the menu is full of seemingly delightful choices of appetizers, bar food and sandwiches. Apparently they even offer a lunch buffet weekdays although I was there on a weekday and it was \"unavailable\" for some unexplained reason. Just as well, I probably would have been sick longer if I had over indulged.   Not in a mood for a burger, although I was initially tempted by a special called a Quesadilla burger until I read that it was served on a deep fried tortilla shell (yuck), I opted for the Santa Fe chicken while my lunch partner got the fish sandwich. A chicken sandwich topped with cole slaw, melted cheddar cheese.. Ok. I'll bite. Bad idea. The chicken looked EXACTLY like his fried fish. Put them both on a plate and I defy you to tell me which is which. Even worse? It tasted like fish. I'm absolutely convinced they fried them both in the same oil. No other explanation. Awful. Just awful!! No excuse for that at all. And his fish was a nasty dark brown color, not golden brown like you'd expect.   I won't go back. I hate when my food looks, tastes, and leaves me feeling like that."}
{"text":"Remodeled - a fun time.  This is a Dave and Buster's esque style of place.   The bar being separated from the video games limits kid traffic.  The bar area made me feel like I was sitting in a Lodge with large flat screen tvs everywhere.    I was there for the beer (they have Arrogant Bastard Ale on tap) while many in our group purchased food.    The crowd like the food.   I liked my beer.  The servers seemed a little overwhelmed at times (I think they were short staffed) which is one of the reasons why I deducted.   They were a little slow clearing tables.  This place needs to continue to work the kinks out.      Service - Our server was great but I had to go to the bar to get my beer.    There were issues with clearing tables.   This was reason for a fair rating - our server was not to blame but scattered all over the place.  Atmosphere - great sports pub and good beer on tap.   Not as many taps as you would see at a Sharp Edge or a Southside bar.  Price - it was pretty reasonable.  Most meals range from the $8 - $12"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late dinner .   Fish was very good and the wings were excellent !   We really enjoy eating here . The clubhouse is definitely on our \"Keeper\" list!"}
{"text":"I recently went to the North Park Clubhouse with a customer for lunch as it is near their office.  She had said that they just remodeled and supposedly everything was even better than it was before so I figured it would be a good experience.  It was just that, a good experience.    I got a cup of wedding soup and a chicken salad... everything was fine, but you couple that with mediocre service and the smell of paint fumes, I cannot say it was anything but just okay.  When I say mediocre service, I am saying it was just not good.  It was status quo.  Had to ask for a refill on my soda since she was not paying attention.  I understand sometimes people get busy, but it was not that busy there and it was a later lunch.    The bar area looks nice with large TVs and a lot of them... I think it may be better for that type of a thing but cannot say for sure.  Worth trying to see if it is something that you like."}
{"text":"We have been back here several times since my post in February.  What we have found is that many of their meals are tasty and the remodel makes the place look nice.  The one flaw that we have seen over several times back is that they can't cook red meat accurately.  My wife got a steak salad and wanted the steak well done (no pink).   It was medium rare at best (still bleeding on the plate).  This has happened several times when we have gone there.  Overall, my best suggestion is that everything is good, but stay away from the red meats."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  This is a great place for a large crowd.  The food is ok but they have a great variety.  The staff are always very friendly.  I went here with a group of 8.  There was no problem getting a table for that size.  We were promptly waited on with a friendly face.  She even asked if we wanted separate checks.  All orders were brought to us in a timely manner.  There are also games to play.  It is a large Chuckee Cheese for adults.  We had a great time.  If you are looking for decent food for a good price and friendly service this is your place!"}
{"text":"I always go to the Clubhouse when I'm home visiting my dad.  It's less than a 5 minute drive from the house, the lounge fries are SO good, Yuengling on draft is cheap, and there's usually an available dart board.   If you went to high school in the area, you'll mostly likely run into someone you went to school with any time you come in here. This, of course, can be really good or really bad, so you're now warned :)"}
{"text":"food is good, normal bar food , priced reasonably, wide variety of beers to choose from"}
{"text":"20min wait on a sat night which turned out to be about 10min so it was looking good but then the disappointment started. I checked my watch and we ordered a mac n cheese with veggies and wings at 6:15PM and we didn't get them on our table till after 7PM - I kid you not. Not sure what was happening but we didn't get out of that restaurant till 8PM - insane! Not the server's fault but she was not even apologetic or didn't come to let us know what was up. The food was standard and the beer list is decent. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"We had high hopes as this looks like a cool place to hang out! Good craft beers on tap! We ordered nachos which actually were pretty decent, although not a whole lot of chicken. Otherwise was too large of a menu to actually be good food. The Mac and cheese we were served was cold, as if they didn't microwave it long enough. Everything else was just ok."}
{"text":"I've been going to the clubhouse for a solid 15 years. Last night my husband and I ordered honey barbecue wings. We both ended up with food poisoning. My husband called and they essentially blew him off. They said no one else has complained so they aren't too worried about it. We were mainly letting them know that they served bad food. I was disappointed in how they handled it and very concerned that others may have had the same experience we had last night. At the very least they could have apologized for the mistake. Unfortunately, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"It's a neighborhood bar that is great to meet friends and watch the game or to sit down and have dinner with your family.       They have done alot over the past year to remodel and update their look.     Additionally they have upgraded their menu as well.    (Though I am disappointed they took away their Pananni sandwiches which I very much enjoyed.)   Though the food isn't gourmet, I am judging this by bar standards and for that they are pretty good.          I recommend for a reasonably priced meal in the North Hills, or just a really great place to watch a Penguins, Pirates, or Steelers game with a crowd that is fun without being overserved."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife for date night. Be careful getting top the restaurant as the outside steps can be icy in the winter! The inside is nice and spacious, a little outdated, and comes with an arcade in the back to keep kids occupied. It was Wednesday night and not too busy and we were seated quickly.   The menu had a few things that were unique and caught my eye. The special, a bbq chicken salad with onion straws, black beans, corn,  and cheese that sounded especially appetizing as did some of the happy hour and weekly drink specials. The salad came with ranch dressing and was a nice portion size. The chicken was cooked ok. The corn was canned which I'm not surprised by but am spoiled and have been used to fresh corn that is frozen. I can definitely tell the difference now when given the two!   Overall this place was alright. It's a little divey and has some decent drink specials. The food is ok. If I come back here again it'll be to enjoy the drink specials as well. Good place for groups and kids with all the space!"}
{"text":"We always have good service here but we come back for the lounge fries. They are the best bacon cheese fries ever!"}
{"text":"Really decent food, and an awesome atmosphere.  Think Chuck E. Cheese for kids and adults and decent food.  It's a local hot spot like that national chain.    Great service with average food.  The loaded fries are awesome, as is the Buffalo chicken wrap and salad."}
{"text":"It's great for families because there is a large arcade section on one side. However, it is loud, and the atmosphere is distracting.  There are lots of tvs on sports channels and a bar in the center.  It's lots of fun if you are in the mood for this bustling atmosphere. Because  you would keep seeing your dates eyes wander to the background, I don't reccomend it for dates."}
{"text":"Average restaurant & bar at best.  The Clubhouse has gone downhill significantly since the passing of the last owner and the sale of the business.  Service varies depending on who you get.  The bar is well staffed and plenty of TVs.  Bartenders are not engaging at all.  You'll get your drink - don't expect conversation.  I miss the \"Northpark Clubhouse\""}
{"text":"Good to very good quality food for a restaurant bar that has more of a bar and game room vibe.  Go on Monday for their 2 for 1 special.  Also, try their Vegas burger.  At the end of the meal you get to roll the dice for a free (if you roll an 11)  or half off (7) burger."}
{"text":"A lot of local regulars for lunch. Which is good and bad. Good cause they keep come back, bad for service cause they talk too much and say strange things cause they are comfortable with one another. Had the gyros. The waitress told me they were bad, and discouraged me from getting them. But truly how can you mess up gyros? Well they didn't. It was great. It was two small pita pockets and the lamb was great. The tzatziki sauce could have been better.  It needed more dill, and cucumbers more finely chopped. Other than that, glad I didn't listen to the typical \"yinzer\" reviews of food. A good dish."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. All of the food came out with something wrong. Asked for no tomato, add onion. Got tomato and no onion. Italian bread with nothing to go on it. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"With the new bar, it has completely changed for the better. The remodeling team did a great job. With bands on their way starting next week this is a great place for people of all ages.
