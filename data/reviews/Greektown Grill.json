{"text":"Delivery took an hour and we live 5 minutes away.  The menu CLEARLY states that plates come with 2 sides.  Guy on the phone asks \"Do you want fries and rice\" I say yes but with potatoes instead of fries.  Order arrives with no rice.  I call back and guy gets arrogant and says it is my fault and I ordered only potatoes.  I didn't want to waste time with him so I said next time i'll just order from marathon's.  And the food was not even good.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Referred by some Greek friends this place didn't disappoint. Had the combo meal which comes with protein, salad, fries and rice. Food was very good. I use to think Marathon was my goto but now this place has converted me. Resto was spacious, clean and had ample free parking.  Service was friendly and attentive. They also serve draft beers and house sangria. Try it!"}
{"text":"Used to order there from when it was still Atomic Pizzeria, too bad it is not like it used to be.  All the prices went up and the food quality went down.  The customer service is bad and the delivery takes too long.  I will not order from there anymore."}
{"text":"Been here twice for two Fridays in a row and I'm seriously thinking about making this a regular habit because the food is delicious!  Located in a small strip mall in a predominantly ethnic/Greek neighborhood, Greektown Grill delivers on all factors of flavors and freshness. We have shared their classic gyro plates that are served with generous amounts of meats and sides of salads, rice and potatoes and most recently tried their whole grilled chicken which was a feast in itself. The portions are generous and very fairly priced, I hope this does not change. We loved having leftovers.  The food is made to order and you can taste the freshness all around, especially from their salads, something so simple turned into a delicacy once you see their ripe red giant tomatoes and rows of lemons straight on their counter.   Only drawbacks are the expensive upcharge for tzatziki sauce ($5 for a small plate) or canned sodas ($2.25.. or 2.50$ a pop?). Also the most expensive meat platters are not served with any sides, I think if you are paying for a whole chicken or variety of grilled meats, they could at least throw in a few potatoes or side of rice. It forces people to buy sides separately which can drive the bill up quite high.  Best value are the gyros/souvlaki plates if you want a full meal from $13 to $18. Ideal to dine in or take out."}
