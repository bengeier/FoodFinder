{"text":"Where should i start? Was excited to try this new restaurant. Came a day before they opened and the lady at the cash was so friendly and welcoming. Came two days later and was not greeted at all. There was no way to tell where to order ...the guy near the food just looked at me with wide eyes. I asked for a mix plate (chicken n beef) he cuts the beef and asks me about my salad n rice choice. He adds the salad to the main part of the takeout container which is usually meant for rice. As for the rice..he litteraly gave me 3 regular size spoon fulls. Then adds the beef...i told him its mixed plate. He doesnt aknowledge. Removes some of the beef that already has tahini sauce on it and adds some chicken. I go to pay and the cashier is on his phone texting and i was visible to him. I ask if this is where i pay and he says yes and apologizes...i gave him a 20 and later realized he overcharged me by $3. The food taste was good but i would never go back. A new restaurant should embrace new customers and win them over forever. Interested to see how others were treated"}
{"text":"If you want a filling meal, Zeytouna won't disappoint. My mixed shawarma plate was piled high with an assortment of goodies. As I carried my full plate to the table, I noticed how large and bright the room was. My eyes were drawn to the unique Middle Eastern-inspired design on the walls. 

The yellow rice was flavourful, but greasy; the salad was crisp and delicious; the potatos were well seasoned, but very dry and the hummus, tahini and garlic sauce were the standard I'd expect from any Middle Eastern fast food joint. But the most important part of a shawarma meal is of course the shawarma! I had a mixture of chicken and beef and both were quite dry, with the exception of a few pieces of beef that had huge chunks of fat attached. I suspect that the meat had been sitting there for a while. Granted, I came in at 11:30pm, a time when it might be unrealistic to expect their freshest fare. 

Which brings me to my next point - because Zeytouna is open late, it makes a good alternative for the many greasy spoons in the area. The service didn't blow me away, but it was adequate. I will come back earlier in the day to try the za'atar, their open faced pita specialty."}
{"text":"Worst middle eastern place I've ever eaten at!!!! I am middle eastern myself and the service is horrible, and the food is disgusting. The meat had a bunch of fat in it as well (BIG NO NO) also I asked for a bit of fries on my plate instead of rice and they gave me maybe 10 fries which is what I asked for, however the cashier charged me $2!!!!!!! And on top of that it was OLD AND COLD!! I actually threw up and I'm not even joking. I never ever complain but when u get taken advantage of and get treated poorly, it's unfair. I seriously rate this place a 1/10. Yuckkkkk. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"After walking by this place many times I decided to go in. I Got the spinach and cheese pizza boat. It was amazing!! Definitely get a takeout container because there is so much food. I got garlic sauce for dipping and it was perfect"}
{"text":"Comida muito gostosa e valor acessível!
O lugar é bem simples mas o atendimento e a atenção do dono foram ótimos!!!!
An amazing food and a just price!!
The place ia very simple but it got points by the service wich was especial!!!!"}
{"text":"As soon as I get there, I had a 10 second look at the menu and the guy was already asking what I wanted. While I continue to decide, the guy is glaring at me with his creepy looking eyes. So we got the 2 chicken shawarma plates and 2 skewers of chicken and beef. First of all the beef wasn't considered beef. It was more like seasoned ground beef on a stick which was made too look like a kabob. We asked him if the beef and chicken skewer was made fresh and he said it was just made just now. The guy tried ripping us off by not giving us pitas for our plates. We ate the plate maybe 10 minutes after purchasing and the food was horrible. The chicken and beef skewer were cold and you could tell that they were old. As soon and you stick the fork in, it was like stabbing into a frozen piece of meat. I definitely do not recommend this place. Food was cold and old and the employees are rude and creepy. The restaurant was completely empty when we arrived (i wouldn't return too if I were anyone else). You're better off heading to Paramount which is a few blocks down on Yonge St."}
{"text":"A brutally dishonest business. 

1. Ordered an item. They attempted to charge me for a more expensive one. 
2. Friend ordered another item, same story. 
3. Repeated multiple times it's to go, no forks. 

Buyer beware ?"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here during baseball season a few weeks back. After ordering my plate, I sat down for about 40 minutes to watch the Blue Jays v. Kansas City on the restaurant's television. After about half an hour, the staff noticed I was still there, gave me an entire cup of tea for free, and cheered the team on. I've gone there frequently since; it's my go-to place in the area.

-The food is great at a decent price. I've tried the half-chicken, chicken shawarma, and a hummus/chicken plate over several different occasions. The meals were high in protein with a good portion of meat.
-The service is excellent.
-The restaurant is clean and spacious with plenty of tables."}
{"text":"i have been to this place a few times and the food wasn't bad.

Today I got beef shawarma and the meet tastes like a week old, full of salt."}
{"text":"Hands-down my favourite place to get Mediterranean food in the city, and the ultimate in comfort food.  Hey, it's been around forever for a reason - Zeytouna never fails to disappoint! I think I'd cry if this place ever shut down.

The Good: You can tell this is a good place because some of the guys working behind the counter at night seem a little high, yet people still flock here to grab some grub to go. My go-to is their chicken schawarma dinner plate, and it's just bursting with flavour - perfectly seasoned chicken, delicious sides of potatoes and salads, and generous heapings of rice, etc. 

The Bad: Service can be a bit slow and they can be a bit stingy over the amount of garlic/hummus they give you, but hey, it's worth it. Just ask for more and with a smile. :) 

The Ugly: Nada. 

Bottom line: After a night out with friends at the club/bar, or a late night studying, or both (hey, why not?!), head here. Your stomach will thank you. Many happy tears have been shed over a plate of their chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"This place looked busy so i went in and ordered the shish kabab plate. I was given a tiny skewer of the kebab, but i let it go. While i was waiting for my transaction to go through, i spotted a giant cockroach on the counter. My then i had already paid for my food but i told the cashier quietly that there was a cockroach. She looked at it and gave me a concerned look but then continued cashing out customers. Anyway i left the restaurant and when i cut into the kebab, it was not cooked (light pink and even red bits).


Do NOT recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Second time going to Zeytouna. Went for lunch, had a quarter chicken dinner. Totally adequate middle eastern fare.
Almost complete my lunch I find a dead cockroach in my food.
I approach the counter discreetly, show him the bug in the napkin and ask the staff member if he knows what it is.
He replies yes
I ask him what he thinks should be done.
He offers to make me a new plate but I point out I just ate an entire lunch. I ask for my money back.
He says he can't do that. For me to come back tomorrow and speak w the owner. At this point I'm getting frustrated and ask him to simply resolve the issue and give me my money back. 
I ask his name he refuses. He says he doesn't give a fuck what I do or say cus he just works there.
He starts to get angry, grabs the napkin with the bug in it from my hands and refuses to give it back after I tell him I want to take a pic of it. He start hissing at me and telling me to leave and gets more irate. 
I tell everyone sitting down in the restaurant to watch out for roaches and then leave.
It amazes me that for $10, this employee could have saved his boss a bad help review, a bad fb review, and a call to the sanitation department.
Owners, pick your staff well. These are the people that will sink you when problems arise.
Do not go here. It has roaches in the food and zero conflict resolution skills"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Decent place to grab some quick, cheap Mediterranean food downtown. Family-run business. Nothing too special, your average place.

I enjoy their dishes with anything falafel and chicken! Very tasty, well seasoned, and good portions!

Only thing I didn't like was that they didn't have AC, so I was as toasty as my shawarma.

Would back here again for speedy lunches and dinners, wouldn't bring a date here."}
{"text":"Perfect location, minutes away from the Eaton center and roughly a block from University. The staff was generally nice and the place had a pleasant vibe to it, but older people and those with lower body injuries might find it hard to climb the steep stairs. 

We came in minutes before the lunch crowd started pouring in so our orders were handed out quite fast. We got the shawarma plate (can't remember the exact words) with a skewer of a nicely done lamb meat, a very tasty serving of brown rice and 2 servings of salads. However, the deal breaker was the Zeytouna veggie (picture), which is a total ripoff at $11+ (close to $12)."}
{"text":"Tasty food, huge portions, lots of selection, clean, super casual place and cheap. Not to mention the guy behind the counter is hilarious and the cashier is very nice. They have a TV playing cp24 for those dining in. What's not to love about this place? 

Recommend sharing a plate for lunch to avoid food coma, or get a takeout container and bring the leftover home since it's still delicious hours later. Warning: the white sauce is really garlicy, which I love, but people may avoid talking to you after you eat it.

My order of choice is the mixed (chicken and beef shwarma) plate with the yellow rice, tabbouleh, and broccoli salad. You also get a side of hummus, garlic sauce, hot peppers, beets, pickles and roasted potatoes with any plate. See, tons of food for under $10. Winning!"}
{"text":"Service was bad, food was ok. After my husband ordered an item, and I said \"make it 2\" - they ended up making and charging us for 3. We didn't argue because we figured it was a misunderstanding, but now looking at other people's experiences of them trying to rip customers off, I'm not so sure. They didn't listen when we asked for different amounts of hot sauce and tahini, just gave us the same on all the sandwiches. What's the point of asking?"}
{"text":"I don't know about their shawarmas, i have never had them, but don't be a fool. Order the Turkish pizza!

I just had their Turkish pizza here which was baked in this proper wood burning oven. The pizza was delicious. This place surprised me, i would def come back for their pizza again. You could taste the smokiness in the crust, it was beautiful."}
{"text":"Worst chewy lamb shank I have had in my life. Should have checked the reviews, they are ALL TRUE!

They cook it and leave it out for the whole day. Such a waste of good lamb shanks, everything tasted bad. Do not go to restaurants that are not busy and have food laying out. 

Maybe the food is good when it's fresh but since it was out all day the flavour is gone from the lamb shank."}
{"text":"Man I miss the old place.  Not sure if there was a change in management or what happened but maybe a year ago the food quality dropped significantly and received a face lift.  Before it would have gotten a 5 star.. now your shawarma receives this treatment..  one tomato, one piece of lettuce, one pickle.. here ya go!"}
{"text":"Very cool, casual atmosphere and outstanding food. I ordered the gyro shawarma platter and it was huge! And all components of the dish were outstanding -- great flavors and textures. I thought there was no way I could eat that much food but once I came up for air it was all gone."}
{"text":"Went there with 5 people on Friday night around 10 pm. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. the guy at the front looked high. Didn't respond when we called him over. We ordered the daily special and he over charged us. When we asked him about the price he said the sign was wrong and the machine was right and he jus wouldn't budge. When we ordered our food he brought te plates over and we realized he didn't even ask us about te sides. He arbitrarily decided what sides we wanted and each of us got different sides. None of which we actually asked for. The music was also blaring and h was playing hardcore gangster rap with swear words an all. The weirdest experience ever. Also the food is really not that great. But they do give a lot."}
{"text":"Can you give a place 0 stars?  The food here has been out for days and tastes disgusting. I unfortunately threw out my lunch. Came here to try something different."}
{"text":"Decent portion and ok prices. But the quality of the food leaves something to be desired. I had a few things here and dont' feel like coming back. I once ordered a spinach turkish pizza. It was alright. but Mr Pide beats it any day. I ordered shawarma several times. Edible but it lacks the rich flavor that I would expect. Feels like I was just eating boiled chicken slices with some spices on top. I thought the spit's purpose is to caramelize the outer layers of the meat? I once had a stomachache after eating. Not sure if related to the food or something else I had earlier. 

The worst parts by far are the salads and rice. The rice felt very dry and the salads don't taste fresh. Could be my fault for coming at 11pm usually but it just means they leave things sitting there for a while. 

I like their prices on the daily specials but it's not a place I would be dying to come back. About a block east is a new Shish Kabob place that sells a more limited selection of middle eastern food but do it better."}
{"text":"They have delicious Mediterranean food here. The prices are very decent. The staff are super friendly. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"After casting my advance vote last Friday at city hall, I was looking for a healthy food option in the area, so I decided to check out Zeytourna which is a restaurant that specializes in Mediterranean cuisine.

I ordered the tawook plate ($9.99 for one skewer or $10.49 for two skewers) which consisted of one grilled chicken skewer, two salads, roasted potatoes and a choice of rice (white or lentil rice). The salads were fresh, the roasted potatoes were okay and the rice was properly cooked, moist but not too moist. The chicken skewer was nicely seasoned but a little on the dry side. The reason for this is because they precook their chicken and when a customer orders it, they take the precooked chicken and reheat it on the grill so the food comes out faster but the chicken loses a lot of it's moisture and juiciness.

Overall, the place is spacious, clean and the people are friendly. The prices are reasonable and the portions are fairly large and it's a decent option for Mediterranean cuisine in the downtown core."}
{"text":"I don't frequently give 5 stars, but this place was on point.  I expected it to be like every other middle eastern place, sort of a cheaper appeal, off the city side corners.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at the presentation and quality of the food even though it is a walk in walk out kind of place.  Very impressed by the fine details of the food, the way they put different vegetables between the kebobs, the meat was fresh and moist, the seasoning was unique, the salad bar was clean and the service was pleasant as well.  Honestly this place really hit the spot and definitely a caliber up from all the other shawarma, and middle eastern places out there that feel a little iffy.

It would be awesome if this was a mid end dining experience, and they actually opened up a quality restaurant.  I think thats what this city needs, theres too much fast for shawarma places and not enough quality sit down restaurant atmospheres.  the food quality in my opinion fits that feeling.  however this place is...sort of grab and go, u can sit and there are quite a lot of tables but it still feels like a....eat and go kind of place. 5 stars for quality of good and attention to detail and garnish and ingredients."}
{"text":"My husband and I had Iftar there and it was very disappointing.. the food was not made well.. my husband ordered the lamb shanks and the meat was literally blue inside. It was so sketchy that we could not eat it and has to order the roasted chicken which was disappointing as well, it lacks flavour and it seems like it was sitting there for a while.  Definitely does not recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch (takeout). Bought the chicken shawarma sandwich for roughly $6.50 with tax. Payed by credit. Friendly service. Good variety of ingredients. Shawarma was toasted after being prepared, and wrapped to be easily eaten without a mess. Overall taste was great, although the quantity of meat was slightly less than expected. Still a great shawarma."}
{"text":"Went there and ordered falafel sandwich and Arabic pastries \" Manaesh\" . Frist of all , they are adopting Subway way, the guy asked me if I want garlic on my sandwich...really!!!, I believe restaurants like this have the responsibility to educate customers about what is the falafel sandwich. Plus some of the ingredients were bad, so I ended up throwing it in the garbage after the first bite. About the Arabic pastries , the dough was nice, I ordered two of them, the cheese one was not that good , because the cheese has no taste , the beef one was good."}
{"text":"This was my very first introduction to shawarma back in 2009. Good place to go for UofT students who want a break from residence or campus food."}
{"text":"I ordered vegetable plate from this place from Ritual: 3 falafels, 2 salads, lentil rice.

The falafel was so salty... Salad doesn't taste fresh. And the lentil rice was also very salty!

I will not come back to this place!"}
{"text":"I love Gyros and have eaten them the world over...this was the first one I have ever disliked.  Took only a couple bites and threw it away.  Terrible meat - very dry and very bland.  The fries I had with it were under-cooked, more like a soggy potato."}
{"text":"Went by today around 830pm for a quick dinner take away. Ordered their number 3 the 2 chicken kabob with Hummus, rice and greek salad. It was my first time there so wasn't sure how to order. The staff not the best in explaining exactly what goes in the meal. Anyways ordered 2chicken skewers plate to go. Got rice because I didn't know it was rice or potatoes or fries staff just asked me what kind of rice. although menu says (rice+garlic potatoes or fries + salad)  I'm sitting here still confused! . When i got to the register to pay I wanted to add baklava and coke the cashier must be new didn't know how to do it and was confused. I got the baklava and coke and was on my way. Got back to my hotel and started to dig in. Chicken really dry over held maybe swing by at peak hours as there was a big stack of chicken kabobs in the holding bin. They should cook less more often. Tried the hummus that was very good only wish they'd not forgot to put in my Pita bread that's supposed to be in my combo. salad was good and pickled veggies were also. Coke well it come from a can so no complaints there. So all in all it's just a so-so Looks like they still got some opportunities in quality and service. As i'm just here on holiday probably won't be back wish them well and hope they work on these key points."}
{"text":"Randomly walked in here today. I honestly didn't expect much but got excited when I saw the different options you could get and it looked like they really piled the food on the plates of the people ahead of us. They also had this cool fire oven which made the place look super legit. We got two shawarmas to-go, one chicken and one lamb. The service was decent, both the servers were quite nice. But man, the food itself was super below average. Both shawarmas didn't have enough meat in them and the meat that was there was super dry. There was way too much onions, felt like I was just biting into a pile of raw onions as times and something in the shawarmas..I couldn't tell exactly what, was definitely not fresh."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Big portions good food. I prefers the chicken, large variety of salads. Open later than most. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken shawarma. Not fresh. Flies around.  Wrapper was entirely greasy so unwrapped it to eat it. Fell apart immediately. Service nice. Has seating
Would not return due mainly to taste"}
{"text":"Got a mixed shawarma plate.  The beef was old and dried up.  Chicken was decent.  The sides were fine, except for the potatoes which were obviously made very early in the day or yesterday and were dried out and cold.  I came between lunch and dinner so I understand things weren't as fresh add they could be, but this was a bit much."}
{"text":"Sandwich special of $3.50 was a steal. Huge serving of  fresh fried falafel topped with some really great things like pickled beets and sauce. I would recommend stopping in for not only the high quality but the serving sizes. You cannot beat this price."}
{"text":"Went there with the family after the auto show. Was not worth it at all. Poor service and stale food. The salad was looked like it was 3 days old, brown and wilted. Even though we said no salad, the guy gave it to us anyhow."}
{"text":"OK and quite fresh. Compared to Ali Baba, main difference is that the food is less greasy here.

But... expensive for what this is (more than Ali Baba), and some smile from the staff would be appreciated. This place would likely be more packed if staff was at least more consistently nice..."}
{"text":"Man shawarma sandwich with lettus, tomato, hummus, garlic and hot sauce put me in bed after leaving university library late everyday."}
{"text":"Terrible place. I ordered shawarma and lahmajun. God it 2as awful. I had it take out and once I got home I had to through the lahmajun out cause I was seriously worried I'll get food poisoning. It smelled and tasted funny."}
