{"text":"Got a Korean bulgogi beef sandwich here along with a logan iced tea, which came to a total to about $13 ($7.49 for the sandwich and $4.49 for the iced tea)..Overall it was alright I guess, just disappointed since I thought it'd have great service since they've already been open for 2-3 months?
When I was asking about the total amount of my order if I got a large sized logan iced tea with my sandwich, the cashier totalled it $20 on the screen! When I looked at what he punched into the screen, the cashier himself didn't notice he added a large sized bubble tea until I pointed it out, but since the pricing for a large logan iced tea was like near $6 I just opted for the regular size, which good thing I did lol.
I was waiting for my order and got my iced tea, and it had logan pieces and I think some type of seeds? Like chia seeds? Idk, wasn't really a fan tbh but maybe thats just me.
While waiting I was watching the employees behind the counter become frantic when they orders kept piling up..They seemed unsure of what they were doing... Some of them using their hands (with gloves of course) to take the salad from the bowl into the rice platter while someone else takes the tongs from another ingredient to use for the same thing...Also saw the older lady itch the side of her nose with her gloves still on while helping with making the orders  :/
I had to wait like a good 15 minutes for my sandwich which was ridiculous, they didn't apologize about the wait, just avoided my gazes as if I wasn't there, then just smiled and gave me the sandwich when they finally finished...The people who had bigger orders than me AND had their order taken after me didn't even need to wait 5 minutes for their order of rice platters or pho.
When I got my sandwich (finally) and took a bite I saw that there wasn't much bulgogi in my sandwich...but the veggies were nice and fresh...Pretty mediocre for the price imo.
I'll probably give them a chance again at a different franchise, just not this one."}
{"text":"This is a food court option that is paired up with Su & Shi Burrito side by side. The menu option is decent and ranges from some special bao sandwiches to 'mii' sandwiches, as well as pho and some rice plate options too. As far as menu options concerned, I am happy with it. They offer a lot of appetizer snacks as well.

I was trying to decide between Finger Lickin' Good next door or a healthier option, so I went to get a sandwich instead. I got the Lemongrass Pork Mii Sandwich at 7.99, and added a pop and small takoyaki appetizer for 2.99, rounding out to around 12.5 after tax. The takoyaki was floury but not bad for a food court. It had some legit squid/octopus pieces in it, so yes I would get it again for a quick add-on. The lemongrass pork was pretty decently sized, had cilantro, cucumber, julienne carrots, grilled pork and teriyaki sauce... yes... I am pretty sure lemongrass does not taste like teriyaki but the whole flavour of the sandwich was full of teriyaki taste to it. Value-wise, I enjoyed the sandwich but looking for an authentic banh mii, this is not the place for it. 

Ordering also took quite a while, 10+ mins. I appreciate the food made fresh (it was done on the spot), but for a food court this needs to be a little quicker. So I knocked down two stars for the taste and the speed. But in the scope of all the food court options, this place is not bad at all."}
{"text":"Above average for food court option. Service was fairly quick and even though ot was lunch time on a Saturday. I ordered the special of the day Lemongrass Pork and fries along with a passion fruit lemonade, total bill $12.41 a bit steep. Sandwich was good however the drink tasted very generic definitely not natural flavor.
Will go back just for the food"}
{"text":"Good location. Especially that its located at square one shopping mall . Its very convenient when your craving for pho and everyone with you wants something else . The mango bubble tea the best for me . Also had the soup it was good . The coconut shrimp was also good had that on special so I tried it as well. Price is a little bit higher than typical pho place but the location is very convenient so I don't mind ."}
{"text":"I was at Square One recently and didn't feel like eating any of the standard fast food and then I remembered there was a Vietnamese stall and when I saw the sign saying \"no msg\", I was sold.  

I tried their vegetarian pho and they said I could have miso or beef broth, so I asked for miso.  

The portion was the equivalent of a small in most pho restaurants, but I was disappointed by the broth. It was very bland and had no taste to it, however there was a decent amount of vegetables.

Would I go back? Meh, probably not for pho, but maybe I'll try something else from here if I'm in the mall."}
{"text":"Amazing service and good vet choices in the food court which besides basil box I never eat at. 

I like the choices that it provides and definitely better than other \"asian\" food in the area. 

Would go back again for sure"}
{"text":"I usually go for those Chinese or Western fast food when I am at square one. Since I got a special promotion on Vicinity, I decided to try this place out for the first time. 

First of all, I am impressed to have a Vietnamese fast food restaurant in a mall. They do provide a fair amount of Vietnamese food selections from the pho noodles to the entree of rice. The promotion I received was to order any pho noodles to get a free medium size of mango smoothie. As usual, I ordered the special beef pho. It came with a big bowl of pho and a fairly big size cup of mango smoothie. 

I wouldn't say that the pho was delicious but among the fast food in the food court, it was definitely a healthy and special choice. As the free offer, the mango smoothie was actually really good. I saw the slices of the real mango in the cup. It tasted so refreshing. In case if you are not hungry but thirsty, the mango smoothie can definitely be the drink to have in the summertime."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I'm addicted to Bao sandwiches... I tried the first ones at Banh MI boys on queen west in toronto but this is the only other one in missisauga that's just as good. 
I reccomend the lemon grass boa chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"A decent Square One food court stall, and something new to try when you find yourself lost in a sea of options in this ever-expanding food court. The service here is fantastic. Very informative, friendly, professional. And they're more than happy to have you sample certain dishes when you aren't sure what to order. However, overall, I think the quality of the meals is a bit lacking, and there's certainly room for improvement. But, the friendly service and wide variety of menu items were definitely positives for me, and I'll definitely be back to try something else.

First, the menu. There's a large variety of items to choose from. They offer various sandwiches, pho, various egg noodle soups and udon noodle soups, and different types of rice platters. Mii Sandwich also works in conjunction with The Sweet Spot, which serves Bubble Teas, Lemonades, Slush Drinks, Asian \"Halo Halo\" desserts, Milkshakes, and Real Fruit Smoothes. So overall, you definitely have options!

Second, the food. I ordered the Korean Bulgogi Beef Rice Platter ($8.49) and a Real Fruit Mango Smoothie with mango chunks. While the food was tasty with decent flavourf, I actually found the meat itself to be very tough to chew and not the best quality cut. It wasn't very tender and took away from the flavour of the dish. The real fruit smoothie was alright, and I wouldn't mind trying out their other flavours the next time I'm in the area.

For everything, I paid around $15.00. I wouldn't mind coming back and trying out other dishes, but there's certainly room for improvement in terms of quality and execution. However, not a deal breaker, and I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Nice but you can get better pho elsewhere for the price. I've been here twice. First time I had lemongrass chicken with rice and I was disappointed. Came back here the other day because I was craving some pho and ordered their special. It pretty much a small size in relation to other restaurants. I liked the broth but I thought there was suppose to be rare beef? Correct me if I'm wrong. I found that their so called special didn't live up to the other restaurants' \"special\" where there's a nice selection of meats. Furthermore, their bean sprouts were not fresh?! They were half-limp and disappointing. I prefer fresh, white, and opaque bean sprouts to give that extra crunch texture. I probably won't be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to try this place because it s $6.99 for a Vietnamese sandwich which I know is usually half the price. But the prices really are on par with the rest is the food court.  Also they have some cheaper bao  combos. I was pleasantly surprised with my lemongrass pork sandwich. It's about double the size of a regular Vietnamese sandwich and comparable to a foot long from Subway so the value is there. Also, it was delicious! I got the mild, which was perfectly spicy enough for me thankfully. I didn't have to add any condiments to it even."}
{"text":"Favourite fast food place at square one. Never tried the hot foods like pho because I always get the tacos and baos. The lemongrass taco is highly recommended for me! 

They also accept Vincinity points and they'll send you promos once in a while."}
{"text":"Always busy and a big hit. 
Beef pho was yummy.  Good broth. 
Chicken Bao was fresh and mouth watering. 
Other recommends are the sweet potato fries and spring roll.  They also carry real fruit bubble tea, Vietnamese french rolls and grilled chicken."}
