{"text":"I have only had takeout from here, and actually had no interaction with staff because a friend handled the ordering and the picking up. So I participated in only the eating portion of this review.

It was sorta lukewarm by the time I tried it, which takes away from a bit of the joy, BUT I still thought it was pretty good! I tried one with vegetables and one plain. (And then I kept eating - what, you think I stop at two slices??) Anyway. I would eat this pizza again for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza, salad and soda for delivery.  It arrived on time and the driver was cool.  The pizza which is some crappy sheet pizza did not have the onions that we ordered and were charged for. The salad was just lettuce and cheese with a half of a tomato. Not really impressed and will order again any time soon."}
{"text":"Good pizza at reasonable prices.  The wings are good, but better if you put them in the oven for 15 minutes to make them crispy.  The staff is very nice.  They moved last week.  :-("}
