{"text":"Visited this cafe for dinner during our stay in Montreal. Ordered the savory spinach, egg and cheese crepe and the sweet fraise, banana and Nutella crepe for dessert. The crepes were OK, they weren't anything spectacular. I'm not a huge fan of crepes so I wasn't expecting much. I think they were a bit overpriced, but that's expected at any crepe place to be honest. My cousin and I split both crepes and we were super full. I would recommend splitting a crepe (or two if you're super hungry) with someone (if you are dining with others)."}
{"text":"Not the greatest but still good. I was hoping for more. I had the roast beef with cheese and lettuce. It was not filling but he sauce that came with it was very good. But in all honesty, I was hungry as heck so I may be miss judging the place."}
{"text":"The hearty crepes that we tried were mediocre at best. Good hearty crepes should use buckwheat dough instead of wheat. We also received the wrong order as the cashier misheard our order.. Back and forth, I would not recommend going here.. WiFi is free though"}
{"text":"Very good crepes. Both savory and sweet were great. We got a strawberry & nutella, lemon & sugar and a ham, spinach & cheese one. The rest of the menu looked good as well. There seemed to be a lot of decently priced lunch and breakfast options."}
{"text":"This place has become my steady morning routine since I came to Montreal. They make fantastic crepes and a good espresso. Pretty decent Wi-Fi connection, too. Try the spinach, egg and cheese crepe!"}
{"text":"We got strawberry banana and chicken spinach ones. It's good but nothing special. Maybe chicken can be more well cooked...  Good idea to cook in front of everybody walking outside.  Average."}
{"text":"This place was our staple when we visited Montreal. We tried the Ham and Cheese, Strawberry and Banana and Raspberry crepes on different occasions and loved all of them. The presentation was superb.  They were also the only place that was willing to make iced tea for us. As Iced Tea is not common around Montreal (except in Starbucks), this shows their service is superb."}
{"text":"Probably not the best crepes I have had. In fact the one I ordered with Nutella and Bananas was pretty dry and tasteless. Just did not hit the spot. Primary reason - hardly and Nutella, making it very dry. Re pace was not too busy but enough people around.  Tables were empty but not clean.  Did not see any urgency from anyone to clean them either. Surprising very disappointing given that it's really hard to make a crepe distasteful."}
{"text":"Voilà le tout premier endroit que j'ai testé à Montréal, j'avais mis le signet uniquement pour me rappeler d'écrire un avis. J'adore cet endroit que ce soit pour le petit déjeuné, le déjeuner ou juste pour une petite crêpe dans l'après midi j'adore tout ici. Je n'ai absolument rien trouvé de négatif.  L'endroit est grand et spacieux. Les tables ne sont pas toutes collées les unes aux autres, vous pourrez donc parfaitement parler et déguster sans entendre toutes les conversations d'à côté. Il y a un grand bar avec toutes les salades, les boissons et les petites choses toutes gourmandes et appétissantes (et surtout très caloriques) mais je suis gourmande (on ne se refait pas), c'est pour ça que je viens tous les matins sans exception depuis mon arrivée pour prendre ma quotidienne crêpe nutella-banane-fraise qui est un délice. J'ai pratiquement goûté à tout ici mais cette crêpe est selon moi indétronable.   Le personnel est super sympa et vous disposez (comme à peu près partout dans cette ville) d'un accès WIFI gratuit."}
{"text":"The crepes are AMAZING. I got the Nutella-banana crepes and my fiancée got the Nutella-berries crepes. We both slurped our crepes up with ease. They also have a selection of hot and cold drinks to have on top of your crepes. Definite recommendation!"}
{"text":"Banana strawberry maple syrup is so good. Good service. Open to the street. Coffees and juices."}
{"text":"After a poor visit to the biodome, renewed my energy with a visit to this crepe cafe. Run by Asians they have a crepe cart out the front and they make an excellent banana caramel crepe. All fresh fruit too. Very nice staff and brought my son an ice water without my asking. The latte was excellent. I want pretty stuffed but still considered one of their tasty looking sandwiches or a gelato but my son was keen to be on our way so no dice to that. Most definitely a place to return to. I'd been thinking of crepes before coming to Montreal and this place ended up not only being the perfect place to go but the highlight of the trip (next to the maple candy place)."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I really enjoyed their crepes. They had savory as well as sweet crepes. I had the Nutella and berries (excuse my French, but I think on the menu they were called \"Nutella et les champs\") crepes with a chai tea latte. Both tasted incredible! We would definitely come back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Decent little cafe on the ground floor of a building with a bunch of art galleries above. We ordered creeps which were pretty good and came quickly. Fruit with Nutella, nothing crazy. The main menu didn't list the prices clearly, so that was a bit off putting at the cash register.   Ps//cute counter guy"}
{"text":"This was a nice little cafe on St Catherine's street. I made a quick pit stop on the last day I was in Montreal.   The café latte was very good. I also got a breakfast sandwich on a croissant. Croissant was delicate, flaky,  and very good.   The server was very pleasant, and the service was good. I'd recommend to anyone to stop in for a caffeine boost and quick rest before continuing on your day."}
{"text":"Mrs. Pinky wanted crepes for breakfast, we got crepes for breakfast. She got egg and cheese, I got apples and caramel. Paired it with a double espresso and a small container of fruit.  It's exactly what you'd expect. Hits the spot if you want crepes!"}
{"text":"I loved this place and I can't believe it was just by accident that I discovered it. I was walking by on St Catherine's last night and saw a guy making crepes in a window. I thought to myself, this is a place to go for breakfast tomorrow and that's what I did today. For less than $11, I got a giant coffee and a huge spinach and egg crepe. I arrived at 8am and there were hardly any customers. I was surprised and then concerned but not for long. Service was fast and polite, and the crepe was perfect! I plan to come back tomorrow and try a crepe from their sweet menu-strawberries and dark chocolate. Mmm!"}
{"text":"Loved the crepes here. You can see them being made and it was pretty quick, which was nice. The savory crepe we got was filled with sliced turkey, spinach, and cheese, and it came with a tangy sauce on the side which was perfect. The sweet crepe with Nutella, strawberry, and banana was a great version of a classic combination."}
{"text":"Pleasant, easy breakfast. In Montreal seems a crepe is required. My favorite Nutella and banana. Yum. Brings back memories of street vendors in Paris"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by here for breakfast.  Both crepes we had were good.  I had the bananas, strawberry and nutella.  She had the strawberrys and creme.  Not being much of a crepe experts ourselves, we enjoyed them.  Also made right in front of you, so that was kind of fun."}
{"text":"I went there for a snack after work.   I ordered the crepe with strawberry, banana and nutella. The cost came at 7.99$. The lady at the cashier asked me to take a seat while they were making my crepe. Another lady brought me my crepe and I munched on them. It is pretty good. The quality of the crepe is the same as Paris crepe minus the overrated price. The place could use a little bit of renovation. Otherwise, it is a good place to hang out with coworkers or after work.  I'm not a fan yet. Maybe on my next visit..."}
{"text":"i had lunch at cafe creme. I had a straberry and nutella crep and an egg and cheese crepe. I loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken, spinach, cheese crepe which came with a tangy sauce that had a nice bite (horseradish?) at the end. Also had the apple, spinach, Brie crepe. Both were delicious. It was the perfect thing to split between two people so we could have savory and sweet. Made a nice light lunch for us as we visited Jazz Fest. I had a Ricard's beer and my friend had a latte. We were both very happy with our meals!"}
{"text":"Delicious - after all the heavy carbs this week, this was a nice light treat. Great breakfast to follow a fatty late night poutine. I got the spinach/cheese crepe, my friend got the special strawberry banana nutella. Great space - not crowded, quick & friendly service. I would come back."}
