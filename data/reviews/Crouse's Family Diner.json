{"text":"A great little 50s themed diner, jukebox and all. Friendly waitresses, good coffee, milkshakes and root beer floats and terrific comfort food."}
{"text":"Let it be noted that this is my 2nd review of this place as the other one several months ago either didn't make the cut or I forgot to post. ------
Old 50's style diner. A dive place shabby and musty smelling. Was surprised to not find a hot dog on the menu. Really? 
We got here just after 1:30 pm althoughnot many people it still took a while to have our order taken. I ordered cheeseburger, stuffed pepper soup, and wife got fries and gravy. That should be 50's diner fare. Stuffed pepper soup advertised as homemade was decent although had a canned tomato soup as the base I believe. Cheeseburger was decent but dry and gravy on fries was ok. All in all our server was very friendly but the other girl who loudly exclaimed \"we're not going to get out of here 'til four\" kind of put a negative on that. If there were  2 1/2 stars that's what I would give. I do believe a diner should have a hot dog on the menu and since nothing else about this place stands out from the countless places like it in the area food wise.  I will go with 2 stars. Can someone in the area please serve a good hot dog?"}

P.s. Get your cook a hair net..."}
{"text":"Service was slow but friendly. The veggie omelet was buffet quality and the pancakes had no flavor. Quite honestly, you're probably better off making your own breakfast at home! If you're looking for a good breakfast, David's Diner in Springdale is the best around. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice friendly atmosphere where proprietors attempt to replicate the feel of a 50s diner.

I had high hopes in my quest for a decent Saturday morning breakfast beyond the city limits, but those were quickly dashed. If you enjoy the quality of Eat n Park breakfast or even Kings, that's pretty much what you get at Crouse's.

I'll just never understand why restaurants offer corned beef hash out of a can - particularly when the atmosphere attempts to portray an old school diner when everything was, in fact, home made, 

Same with the sausage gravy. I couldn't be certain it was from a can or was made by the chef, but what I am certain of is that it had no flavor, which leads me to believe it was from a can. It's darn hard to make tasteless sausage gravy from scratch,

And then there was the Orange juice, which was thin and bitter. When i mentioned it to our waitress she said they had been getting those complaints today. In fact, the table next to us had just sent their glass back. Nonetheless, we were charged for the still full glass.

The journey continues..."}
