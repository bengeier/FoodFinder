{"text":"Always consistent, freshly prepared express Japanese food.

Its cheap, always pretty fast (I've only waited once after calling in a to-go order) and you can always expect the same good food (although I agree a lot of the dishes taste similar). The scallops are small but good, the steak is good- \"what you'd expect\", hibachi vegetables are awesome. I really like the carmelized carrots that come on the side too. 
If you're not expecting 5-star Japanese hibachi its absolutely wonderful. Always make sure to ask for the shrimp sauce, mmm."}
{"text":"Atami is very similar to many other japanese express restaurants, but in a good way: they always give you tons of food, and the shrimp sauce is excellent.

I've been to some sub-standard japanese places before, and compared to those, Atami is cleaner, bigger and less greasy. The sweet tea isn't very good though. What's up with Chinese and Japanese restaurants serving sub-standard tea?

Aside from that, Atami is a great place to get a quick, good tasting meal. The service is prompt, and the bill at the end of the meal is small. When you're looking for a quick lunch or dinner, what more could you ask for?

My pick: Hibachi chicken with mixed vegetables. Don't forget the shrimp sauce. Yum."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. For me it's just ok though. The dishes mostly taste the same whether you order teriyaki or hibachi varieties. The turnaround on take out orders ranges from really fast to really slow. It's a crapshoot. It's a decent option if you want something Japanese-ish and not fried at a reasonable price."}
