{"text":"Wow.  The food was great and it was a great value.  I came in for steak and ended up having their new Teriyaki steak. It was awesome!  My kids loved the chocolate fountains and desserts."}
{"text":"great food at a fair price...entire family loved it.steak and seafood..with endless trips.come hungry"}
{"text":"It was just ok. Some of the items they were out if. Staff was friendly,  could if been a little cleaner Not sure why they're trying to push breakfast at night, didn't see any do the breakfast thing...I'm sure the eggs we're like rubber for sitting so long.."}
{"text":"What can I say? Horrible Grade, really BAD food and the place smells as though it was cleaned with dirty dishwater! Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast in a group of 5 on a Saturday. Plenty of seating and decent prices. Some of the food was a little too greasy and nasty. But the majority was good. Waitress was a little slow for not having a lot of people, but she was very friendly."}
{"text":"My Husband and I just left here from getting a to go plate.  We asked for a drink and were charged for a 32 Oz beverage.  We were given a 16 Oz cup so we asked for them to please fix it.  The manager came over and told us it was the right cup and if we would have paid 50 cent more we would have gotten the bigger size.  I have my receipt and it clearly says 32 Oz beverage and the bottom of my cup shows 16oz.  I know its not much but they basically stolen from me.  I've NEVER had something like this happen,  it's shameful.  I've never left a review because I know some things can't be helped or sometimes people have things going on we don't know about.  But keeping money or over charging for something you didn't get should NEVER be excused.  This is basically theft."}
{"text":"Terrible service , waitress kept talking loudly with another worker and were both on their phone . food was very bland and greasy , had to wait almost 20 min for a steak talked to management and he acted like he didn't care about his job. So won't be back again! Don't even bother trying out this place take your business somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Nice Staff, guy up front was nice & gave us a coupon, since their car won the race So, kids ate free and everyone had their own selections (quite a lot) to choose from..  The Waitress, Isabel (management said he thought it was her), was VERY attentive and looked as though she really enjoyed her job!   The price was reasonable enough with the discount and we'd love to come back for Prime Rib Weekend!   Only Complaints would be:   1. Peel and Chop the Cucumber  2. Need Diced Tomatoes  3. Ham Bits need to be chopped smaller"}
