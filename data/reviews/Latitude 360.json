{"text":"Great place for a Christmas party gathering. But food was horrible. Buffet was not kept full and food was cold. Also it was overlooked and chewy. and undercooked. Appetizers only have cheese no crackers. Veggies were fresh. Also don't leave your drink alone for a second. It will disappear. I was gone just 30 seconds to grab my handbag from a table and my glass was scooped up."}
{"text":"I was just there tonight for the comedy show. We had a group of 10, and we all got dinners, appetizers, and drinks. They charged us for too many drinks, mixed up our orders, took way too long to bring the food and check and return the check. The food all tasted bad. I personally had the chicken Caesar salad...hard to screw up right? For one thing, the tiny burnt chicken I got cost $4 extra, the dressing tasted terrible, but at least it covered the taste of the bad lettuce. The comedy act was ok...the opener was terrible, but the main act had us laughing semi consistently.   I will never go back...not even if every bit if this expensive terrible night was free."}
{"text":"It's probably not even worth my time to review Latitude 360 at this point, as it seems that they are about the board the place up at any minute.  BUT, I will anyway.  We first visited this place about a year ago for a dine-in movie.  It was a pretty good experience, and we both agreed it wouldn't be our last time there.  In July or August, we went to bowl for something to do with an out-of-town visitor.  During that visit, we ended up signing up for their membership.  It was a pretty great deal - lots of freebies, including rounds of bowling, movies, comedy shows... and a $25 credit for games each month.  So, even if we just used the game credit, we got back what we paid.  Fair deal!    Life got busy, and we didn't get back as often as we'd have liked after October.  We stopped in for dinner one night in November, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary.  Service was a bit slow, but it wasn't anything alarming.    Fast forward to early February 2016.  We decided to go for bowling and a visit to the game room on a freezing cold Saturday.  We got there around 9:45 or 10 PM and asked for a lane.  There were at least a few lanes open that we could see, but the guy behind the counter said that they were already on a waitlist and not selling any more games for that night.  Um, ok?  You guys are open until 2AM, no??    So, whatever.  We went to play some games instead.  Our first stop was the prize room, where they had to refill our card with the credits from our membership.  I won't bother posting the pictures we took, because I see some others have shared the same ones.  But, there was LITERALLY nothing left but a box of halloween spider rings, some pieces of candy and a single train set up on the wall.  If I'd just walked into that room, I'd think for sure they had been out of business for months.  Still giving them the benefit of the doubt (maybe they're just doing a complete refresh of the prizes, we thought?), we proceeded to the game room.  The first game we tried took our credits, but never did anything.  It was one of the ones where a ball drops into one of many little wedges on a spinning board, and you get points based on wherever it lands.  Well, there were no balls?  So, we tried the other game that is similar.  It appeared to be working, but wouldn't even take our card.  Moving on.  We played Deal or No Deal and Connect 4 without any issues.  But, then we moved on to the big spinning wheel (like the Price is Right wheel) and gave it a few tries.  TWICE, we landed on the 4,000 tickets section and it gave us like 15 tickets.  I mean, we're grown-ups and already have all the spider rings we could possibly want (LOL), but come on.  It was clearly on the 4,000 tickets section, so pay up.  What?  You think I'm going to wind up with enough to redeem for the ONE THING left in your prize room?  We worked our way through the games, mostly commenting to one another how pitiful it was from the first time we'd been there.  I'd say at least 80% of the games they had were either empty, not working or malfunctioning.  I guess if you count the issues I outlined above as malfunctioning, it's probably closer to 90%.  ONE of the 6-8 skeeball tables was working.  The claw games were completely empty.  Many games weren't even plugged in.  It was really embarrassing.    After this dreadful experience in the game room, we went upstairs to see if people were bowling up there.  It was surprisingly busy, so we proceeded back downstairs.  I decided to ask one more time if we could get a lane to bowl, and - what do you know?? - they put us right on a lane!  The shoes were gross, but I don't have very high standards for bowling shoes, so I'll look past that.  They put us on a lane over by the wall and we were up and running with our bowling game in no time.  This was surprisingly the only time we'd bowled here where we DIDN'T have any technical issues.  The game never froze, the pin grabber never got stuck... it was a pretty smooth round of bowling.  And, I actually bowled pretty well, too.  :)  I would prefer a little more room between the lanes.  The sofas are positioned in an awkward way for bowling.  You kind of have to sit on the little table on the edge, or you can't see anything.  They could also stand to clean up a bit more between games.  But, the bowling experience was quite nice.  I have no major complaints.    Needless to say, we cancelled our membership after this visit and probably will not return.    So, if you're right down the street and desperately want to go bowling.  Maybe give it a shot?  Otherwise, run far and fast.  Otherwise, you'll be very disappointed.  It's a shame, really.  This was a really unique use of the old Roomful Express building.  They fixed it up quite nicely, and it had great potential to be a super fun spot to hang out with friends and family.  I have no idea what went wrong, but it's really a disaster.  I'm expecting them to close for good within the next month or so."}
{"text":"Ok if  u want a Beer and watch a game. However if you want any mixed drinks Beware they charge an extra DOLLAR FOR ICE  Rip off !  . Service is not great either."}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE!! Not sure it was worth the $, but the food was good and the wait staff was very friendly.  We had a pretty decent time overall."}
{"text":"The only reason it's getting two stars is because the kids had fun playing in the arcade otherwise no stars would be given. The service started out great. We were the only diners that day. We were a large party of ten. Two families. When we asked for two separate checks the waitress rolled her eyes and and gave \"the sigh\". The food was average. I ordered a medium well burger and it came medium rare.  I ate it. My friends daughter had chicken tenders that were more like burnt rocks. I cant believe they were let out of the kitchen let alone served.  This we did complain about and Chrissy,our waitress, didn't want to take care of it and after some push finally decided to have it remade. But since the child had eaten some of the fries from the first order she wasn't given any on the remake.  The second order was slightly less than burned but more edible. The waitress loomed over our table clearing dishes as soon as she felt we should be done. Now remember this is an arcade setting so the kids got up to play more games the adults were still eating but the waitress thought we should be done and we get the bill. Four people 75.00.  Gratuity had been added to our bill but the waitress failed to inform us.  My friends bill had all these up charges. She was charged twice for pizza toppings,and after pointing it out to the waitress and some hemming and hawing from the waitress, she took off the extra charges still making an 8 inch pizza over 16.00. Serves one adult! We sat at our table for nearly an hour while the kids were playing in the arcade and were completely ignored by our waitress. The waitress did come back to the table but only  to clear some glasses.  Sadly the place was near empty when we got there for lunch and completely empty after we left at 3:30.  There are many better choices out there for fun and games!  won't be returning"}
{"text":"Describe this place in two words?  SUPER FUN!!!!!  I have been to the one in Jacksonville so I had to check out the Pittsburgh location at the grand opening.  There is so much to do - you can bowl (fun, fun, fun, date night), you can play games, or you can just sit back with some good food and drinks and watch the game.    This is a very unique place.  I'm already planning a girls night out here for a friend's birthday.  So glad to see a progressive NYC / Vegas style (Have you been to Lucky Strikes) venue open in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We love going to latitude 360,we have been members for about a year now. Every time we go, we have an awesome experience, games, food, bowling, and tons of family fun, how can you beat that? Tonight, my family and I came to have nothing less than a fun time, until our 4 year old, 29 lb son was riding their arcade street bike, when a much larger 15 year old boy came over and pushed my son off of the ride screaming \"get off!\" My husband didn't want to say anything to the boy directly, so he looked to see who was in charge of the boy. He came across a woman that looked to be in her mid 20s, maybe an older sister or maybe even his mother. He said to the woman, \"please correct your son as we felt that our 4 year old was bullied by your 15 year old\". Our son was frightened by this bigger boy and he hasn't even started preschool yet. About 5 minutes after my husband approached the woman, she came chasing us down, screaming \"he said he didn't do that\". I stated that I saw the whole thing and that the 15 year old boy clearly pushed my son off of the ride. 2 minutes later, the lady's father and a manager came over and said that we were kicked out because of the way we SPOKE to these people!!!! We were kicked out because we were sticking up for our 4 year old little boy who was physically PUSHED by a 15 year old boy. We are taught in our schools that bullying is absolutely not tolerated and the manager with the red hair had no remorse that our son was PUSHED. We are still in much shock by this whole thing, we don't know to call the news, or to press charges against the boy who pushed our son. But we were made out to be the bad people after stating what was right and what was wrong."}
{"text":"$90 for crappy bar food for 3 people. Not worth the price. Dirty martini was really poorly made."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, lots of great games, and a great bar! l can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"Busy place, busy atmosphere. Food was good but certainly not the main attraction. Nice bar selection and friendly staff. Nice mix of different things to do...Good venue for parties"}
{"text":"Looks way cooler than it is. They spent a lot on a pretty menu that only lists the brewery not the beer. When I asked what was on tap by _____ the waiter said an IPA everytime. He didn't know anything about the great beers they have on tap and admitted he was a coors light guy.   The menu wasn't appetizing. I couldn't find a decent meal for an average price. *I was with the boss so high priced stuff was out. I got meat loaf for the hell of it. The side choices sucked. So said just potatoes, the waiter offered double potatoes so I why not. I got a moutain of potatoes, some reheated meatloaf, and barely any gravey. My dog loved me for the left overs.  It looked cool enough to drink beer and watch a game but at a price."}
{"text":"I was there with a group, and had a great time! We saw a movie & had dinner at the Cinegrill.  The price was great & my grilled chicken sandwich was yummy! Then we hit the nightclub & danced to the great band.  Manager Ron was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is what happens when Chuckie Cheese, Dave & Buster and BW3s  have a three way and give birth.  Atmosphere is LOUD!  Must know sign language to communicate.  The physical plant is huge and over two levels.  60k sqaure feet include a bowling alley, movie theatre, video games, bubble wall and disco.    Decent tap selection with a handful of micros and select beers including DogfishHead 60 minute IPA, Chmay Triple and Southern Tier.  Bartenders are talented, especially this young man named Andy.    We were there with a group of 10. Food is mostly bar regular fare with a couple of unique items with mostly nice presentation.   Our server was attentive and our drinks stayed full.  This was their first week of operation and the kitchen was in chaos.  It took about an hour for our food to come out with a very small crowd in the house.  I had buffalo wings.  Sauce was thin and uninspired. One of our group ordered the fried fish, coming out frozen in the middle.  The dinner was comped.    My wife had grilled chicken breast and sweet potato fries.  It was fair with decent portion size. Friends had the chicken flatbread and it looked very good.   Overall, I found prices to be on the high side for a sports bar menu and atmosphere.  I will give them another try once the kitchen is in order, but need to find a quieter space."}
{"text":"Went back again...on new years day, to the \"cinnegrille\".  #1. On the website they say it's the full menu....not true.  #2. We were early, and waited 30 min to get drinks....it was 50/min ( after the movie started) until we placed our order...our waitress brought half of our food....then brought another plate....the brought me 3 different plates....none what I ordered.  When I finally got my burger it felt like it was sitting under a warming plate the entire time I was waiting for it.  It was terrible.  And the check was wrong... My wife went back twice to try and fix it.....after the movie all of the card charging kiosks were out of order...games out of order...we left.  Last time we will go there... Period.  Wish I could give less than one star"}
{"text":"We were here for a friend's birthday party. We had a large group but our waitress took forever. It was almost an hour after we sat down that she was able to take our order. Most of our drink orders were wrong. When we went to the bowling lane we had reserved there was trash EVERYWHERE, even though we had the lane at 8:30 and didn't make it over until 9. We had to pile it up and put it by the trash can in the corner. They were out of many sizes of bowling shoes and we didn't even try to order drinks because it was clear no one would help us.   I hope to never come back here again."}
{"text":"I, sadly, spent a Thursday evening at this establishment. The only reason I was caught dead in this place was for a work function. My husband told me to give it the benefit of a doubt. When we first walked in the door a man greeted us. Ok, off to a decent start and I thought perhaps he was directing traffic. When I explained we were with a Company party, he acted confused and just told my husband they had a dress code and he had to remove his \"tassel\" cap. Really? Is this Pittsburgh's \"hottest new club\"? I think not. It was 13 degrees and he's bald. As we walked into the bar area, we noticed patrons wearing crummy ball caps. Apparently, those were fine. We finally were able to locate our party by calling a co worker. It took over 20 minutes to actually flag down a waitress to get our drink order. I tried some of the food paid for by our company. I'm reasonably sure the salsa was rancid. Ok, we'll grab a brew and food at Bocktown later... Twist my arm. We were really there to bowl. Not only was the bowling shut down 10 minutes early for our two hour window, but when we asked to extend and PAY extra money, we were refused. Apparently other people were waiting for our particular lanes as the place was empty. After a $1,600 bill to my company, poor service and crummy food.... Never again! Just make the extra 30 minute drive to arsenal lanes in lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, waitress knew nothing about the menu. My order of mahi mahi tacos came out wrong twice! And then my bill was messed up. The management only gave me free $10 gameplay after all that! Worst night ever...."}
{"text":"Not the best food I have ever had. Let's just say the food was pretty bad but the waiters were decent the bowling was the stupidest thing the arcade was the best however! If your looking for quality food don't go here. But the prizes are to much because they are thirsty for that money. In conclusion I give this place a 9/30."}
{"text":"Have eaten at the first floor restaurant 3-times now.  Each time I have been very happy with the meal.  I think the prices are reflective of the portion size (and maybe the to-do possibilities post-meal), but very reasonable nonetheless.  Even the latitude pad thai (lat-thai-tude i believe) was very good - and thai can be a risky proposition at some bar/restaurants. Games were awesome - but more for adults and kids over 10 than for my pipsqueaks (aged 4 & 5).  Upstairs concert bar is a VERY fun place.  Saw Radio Tokyo (ROCKS) and they had a very large crowd... we were still able to get good drink service and have decent conversation.  Thumbs up - can't wait for the movie theater to open!"}
{"text":"So 3 of my girlfriends had a girls night out here. The place is huge and the have tons to do. Bowling, arcade games, live entertainment and a cinema. We opted for the live band since they were showing The Hobbit at the cinema which I found quite odd.... So the band was an 80's cover band there first set wasn't good but they quickly changed that around during there second set. The drinks were fairly priced but the wait to get a drink was longer than I would've liked. Around 10:30 the band area got a little packed and we all got down on the dance floor. I think this place has it all for date night, chillin with the kids or girls night out"}
{"text":"THE BEST PLACE EVER...  Great bowling and an excellent arcade with an awesome prize room. Unlike chuck e cheese or Dave and busters, you get your money's worth for the prizes, and I mean good prizes! The waiters and waitresses are very nice and get you refills whenever you need, also they ask if you need extra napkins, silverware, ketchup, and such. The place is very tidy and kid friendly. Great staff, great location, and great arcade and bowling."}
{"text":"eh... Is really how I give my opinion on this place. It's just not set up right in my opinion. When you walk in you're immediately greeted with two places to eat. A café style restaurant or pub style. Both serve the same food so I don't really understand that one. Why not put a restaurant upstairs? I heard good things about the theater and stage though. Two large bowling lanes boggles my mind when you could use some of that space for a bigger arcade or club. The club upstairs is small and not organized properly, and the arcade downstairs is just boring. It's like some rich guy's game room with some games just thrown in there.  All in all this place is ok for a large group but be prepared because this place gets packed. Food is ok beer is typical and staff is average."}
{"text":"Been a member since October, love the place! We live 40 minutes away and it's worth the drive and the $25 membership fee for all you get! I see people post that it's too far away to join, well, it's worth it for us! Each month we get 2 free comedy tickets (and I'm constantly winning extra ones) so the hubby and I are guaranteed one date night a month. 1 hour of free bowling which we use after comedy show to \"bowl away our buzz\" and drive responsibly. Free movies Monday-Thursday for up to 6 people so our family of 4 can always be found in the back row at the 6:00 Monday kids movie. Free kid's meal and $5 game card with every adult entree! Our bill is around $26 and with a generous tip, we usually spend $40 (I keep in mind all the free stuff I'm getting and tip the servers well since we're regulars-they take care of us; we take care of them!) Still, $40 for 4 dinners, 4 movies, and $10 in game cards is a crazy good deal! You got a question about this place, I can tell you; I practically live there!"}
{"text":"This is a great Family place. They have Bowling, A Room with Big Screen TV, Big Game Room, Live Entertainment on Friday & Saturday for Adults... Great Place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so bad they should pay YOU to go there.  We had been wanting to check this out for a while and when we finally got there, what an awful experience.  First of all, we were the ONLY people in the restaurant area ordering food, yet It took 15 minutes just to get menus brought to the table.  The waitress would disappear for 20 minutes at a time - One of us had to go to the bar to get waters refilled THREE times.    It was clearly a huge inconvenience for her to wait on us.  After a dinner which took an hour longer than it should have, we decided to spend the last hour playing games.  About 15 minutes before closing, we went to cash in our tickets. CLEARLY we were done playing and on our way out the door, yet were still told 3 times by a staff member \"just so you know, we're closing now\".  A minute later a bar bouncer walks in to tell us that we need to wrap it up and go!  Mind you it was not even closing time yet.  All in all, the customer service was so bad here that it doesn't matter how many cool activities they have.  Go to Dave and busters, they have way more games and there's a movie theatre right across the street. Don't waste your hard earned money to get treated like crap."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fun. The worst buffalo chicken salad I've ever had. Chicken was cold with a 20 minute wait and then a longer wait because they didn't put the buffalo sauce on. Not cool."}
{"text":"The service was fast. Great pizza. However, as someone with a shellfish allergy, I find it frustrating that this is yet another restaurant where cross-contamination is apparently an issue to the point where everything is grilled together, fried together, and so on."}
{"text":"Standard ambience for such a location. Too crowded. Bowling lanes too few. Probably can book in advance. Too pricey for the level of service and quality of food. Will I hi again? Yes, probably for a beer or two."}
{"text":"We did the cinegrille movie experience. Got mahi tacos and shrimp po' boy. The food was quite tasty, well seasoned.  No clue how it looked at all, but the movie provided enough ambient light to eat. The hostess was slightly overwhelmed, but at the end they gave us a free ticket to return because they were sorry they were short staffed. Honestly I didn't mind the pacing, I was quite content watching the movie on the plenty large projector in the comfy very spacious bucket seats. A cool experience, definitely beats plain popcorn with movies."}
{"text":"Food is ok at best. Over rated Dave and busters. Came in with a 10 top asked server from start to spilt bill. At end he hands us bill and a pen asks us to put a number next to what we ate. Took forever."}
{"text":"Dave & Buster's on steroids! That's exactly what I thought on my first official visit here.   I decided to check this place out for bowling. I had previously walked in and planned to bowl but it seemed pretty pricey at the time and there was a wait to boot. Because I got tired of driving past this place wondering what all the hype was about, I decided to take the plunge.   We walk in and are greeted by a guy offering a free or paid rewards program. I opted for the free since I didn't really know what to expect at that point. He was very nice and funny which made us feel welcomed. To my surprise, we got a chance to spin the wheel for prizes after signing up for the rewards program. I won free bowling and shoe rental(up to $60 value). Another spin got us 4 free movie tickets at Cinegrille. The nice thing was that we could use the tickets that day. Pretty cool right!?    We checked in for bowling and it was about an hour wait so we headed to the game room with our pager in hand. While it wasn't as massive as D&B's, I thought it was sufficient. I must mention there were a couple games out of order and we lost several credits as a result but there were too many people in the redemption area for me to worry about getting a couple credits back and wouldn't deter me from coming back.   Finally out buzzer went off and we were told our lane was ready. The guy at the check in desk was very friendly and all smiles. He assumed we knew how everything worked but once we explained it was our 1st time, he gave us some helpful info and directed us upstairs to our lane.   I was really surprised at how clean, bright and massive the space is. We had our own area with plush white pleather seating, ample table space and an easy to use electronic display. This is not your granny's bowling alley. As a matter of fact, that's the last type of bowling alley I was in years ago. Back then it was smoky, uninviting and drab....but still fun (at the time).   Although it took about 10 gutter balls for me to get my roll back down, it was such a great time. Can't comment on the food but we did have soft drinks provided by a waitress who was very attentive. It's pricey but I honestly think it's worth it for what they offer. Work hard, play hard...right?"}
{"text":"Sorry, Latitude 40, I ain't buying it.  Let me count the ways:  1.) I have never paid this much to bowl in my life.  Yes, the lanes are pinstriped beauties, but I am by no means a pro bowler so the difference in quality is not worth the price to me.  2.) Solid suburban super wasted 40+ crowd on a Friday.  The only thing more annoying than drunk college bros is when those bros are now obnoxiously drunk at 43-years-old.  3.) $24 for a pitcher of Blue Moon.  TWENTY-FOUR AMERICAN DOLLARS.  I can't.  4.) It took 20 minute to get said pitcher because the lanes have \"waiter service.\"  That's could be a nice perk if it wouldn't have taken less than 5 minutes at the bar instead.  5.) You would need to be tipsy to tolerate this place, but that's expensive, and then you have to find a DD because good luck getting a cab from here (and there are no buses).  The only pluses were the 80's-00's music selections--vintage Usher, anyone?  Also that they had the rare 6-pound ball, which I need and use.  The apps ran from decent bar food to great bar food, and we pretty much tried them all since we had a couple lanes.  The highlights were the onion rings and the chicken fingers.  The low was the fries for sure."}
{"text":"Cigar Bar Review...  5 Stars for having the guts to have a nicely furnished Cigar Lounge.    The chairs were very comfy, the hostess was quick & efficient, the prices were great for Robinson and the place filled up rather quickly after we arrived.  The cigar selection is rather limited but I wouldn't expect this place to have a massive humidor when they don't know if this is going to take off or not (I carry my own supply).  On price- the Kuba Kuba's that I normally smoke cost me about $8.50 each- here they're $12.  This place's comfort is worth the mark-up.    The tv's were all on The Final Four tournament but the hostess quickly turned on something else when a couple guys requested it.  My only complaint was that the door to the lounge doesn't have one of those automatic closers so the smoke would 'waft' out into the hall/bathroom area if someone forgot to or didn't notice they had to close it manually (I try to be a considerate cigar smoker).    If you're in the area and looking for a nice place to enjoy a quiet smoke, check this place out..."}
{"text":"The food in the restaurant was good. Service was lacking. The kids loved the arcade. The bar scene and stage area were nice. Can get a bit loud in the evenings."}
{"text":"Unfinished and unenthused!   My Husband and I went on 11/16 for date-night (sans our 2 children), and it was awful: too much unused space; entirely too expensive ($46.00 for 1-hour of bowling after 5:00 pm on the weekends); too many children (curfew is 11:00 pm); typical bar; and the food menu was similar to that of an Applebee's.  To top-it off, the place wasn't finished: the Theater wasn't open; there were roped-off corridors that weren't painted; the \"night-life\" area was closed, because the lighting wasn't done.  We will default to Dave and Busters for a guaranteed good-time!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I was the maid of honor for my friend in June and when it came to the bachelorette party, we were having a hard time finding a place that her little sister (19) would be able to get into. I asked another girl who actually lives in Pittsburgh to scout out some places where we could drink with a younger person in attendance. She came up with this and I think it worked out as well as it could have.  For the positive, the restaurant was decent - absolutely huge portions for the price and a very friendly server. They accommodated our 6 way split checks and having an underage person at the table. The club section looked like it would be fun, but since we had a younger person we left at 10 since she couldn't go in that area. I don't blame them for this - we knew she wouldn't be allowed upstairs, so another girl took the bride clubbing downtown afterwards. I am grateful for this place because I'm not sure we could have gotten away with having that many drinks with a teenager present any other way.  For the negative, bowling was extremely overpriced. $42/hr (not including shoe rental) for one lane seems ridiculous. The game room was also a ripoff. You had to buy cards with an \"activation fee\" meaning it would be over $100 just for the arcade games by the time we all got our cards loaded. We just skipped it and went straight to bowling after dinner.  I give the restaurant 4 stars and the bowling/arcade 1 star. The upstairs club floor looked like it would have been decent, so I'm giving 3 stars. Surprisingly good restaurant, gotta give them credit for that."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Latitude since they opened and have notice a decline in service.  Tonight we sat for almost 20 minutes before a server came over, even after we told the hostess no one had came to our table.  Luckily a kind waiter came over when he noticed how irritated we were, he apologized and took our order.  We have struggled to use our blue membership card and decided to cancel it."}
{"text":"I came here for a large office party thrown by the law firm my boyfriend works for, and it was a pleasant enough experience. The food was a mix of good and really really bad. The brisket was decent as was the Mediterranean chicken and the various sides, but the peanut butter cream pie seemed to have come from the Giant Eagle freezer aisle and the salmon was so fishy you could smell it from ten feet away! (I'm from California, I know what good fish is like and this wasn't it.)  On the other hand, the service was top notch from start to finish. The staff were friendly and helpful, even tracking down rude guests who had ordered a drink and wandered away from the bar area. Seriously, who does that? Our plates were all cleared in a timely fashion, and overall they did a wonderful job of keeping the rather chaotic party space clean and orderly without interrupting the flow of events.  After our private event had ended, my boyfriend and I wandered out to the dance floor and enjoyed a few songs. The live band was suitable for the purpose of playing for mostly drunken suburbanites, which is exactly what they were doing. It was definitely an older crowd (I nearly got pulled into a post-menopausal conga line!) but everyone seemed to be having a great time. I'd gladly come back here for any event I was attending as a guest, but this isn't exactly the sort of place I'd pay out of pocket for."}
{"text":"Saturday night after dinner my fiancé and I went here for some music, drinks and to bowl! The bowling lanes were full until 11, so we went upstairs to have a few drinks until then. The Band Bon Journey was playing, which seemed a little old for the crowd, none the less live music is always great! We waited for 10 mins at the bar before being noticed by the bartender, when we ordered a captain and Coke and glass of wine she rolled her eyes like a glass of wine is SO inconvenient. By round 2 I ordered some tequila shots, no lime or salt given. By this we should have quit and left.. But before we went to bowl I order 2 cherry bombs.. Biggest mistake yet! She tells me they don't have cherry vodka and asks if grape is okay, I politely say yes and then the bartender, Leigh was on her name tag, says \"sorry I poured peach, I hope that's okay\" then pours WARM monster on top. I almost gagged! If I am paying $50 for 2 rounds of shots and drinks I think it should be served properly! We were so upset we didn't bowl and left! I will NEVER RETURN!"}
{"text":"I can't say much about the food here other then the burger I had at the burger competition at the casino a few months back was ok. Not my top 3 but it was good. We took Vince here yesterday and he had so much fun. He loved the ball drop game. It wasn't over crowded and for $50 we played for prob 45 min. when we had spent all the points on the card it was time to get toys. we had 1200 tickets. The prize selection was nice and all the toys that were eye level with my 4 year old were around 50-200 tickets each (hot wheels 150). I like this place for kids but not a place I would choose to go with a group of adults. I still have tickets to a comedy show that they gave out at the burger thing so might be checking that out soon."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if possible. We made a reservation for two bowling lanes from 9-10. My friend's card was charged. Four couples drive out to Robinson to bowl and they don't have a reservation for us. They had no lanes available and couldn't help us out. This place is horribly run and will be out of business in no time."}
{"text":"This is a great and awesome venue for adults. With all the money they spent decorating this place they need to put more effort into to better food and service. The food is hit or miss. They have a comedy hall... Cigar bar... Outdoor patio... Band bar... Bowling.... Eat in movie theater... Restaurant. . Bowling allies.... Bar.... Video game room....  All they need is good food, better service,  better video games...last time I was there all there good prizes were gone. ..  Easy to fix.... they will have a stampede."}
{"text":"It's a really fun grown-up entertainment complex tucked into one of the many shopping plazas of Robinson Township, a la Dave and Busters. I've been here twice now, and the last time was for a private company holiday party.  On both occasions I found the staff to be quite friendly and on top of things.  Bowling here is pretty pricey, but you're paying for atmosphere and the equipment is nice and modern.  They have live bands, a dance floor, more than one full bar, and a game area.  I would say that the games are given pretty limited space compared to everything else, but that's probably because they make more money serving alcohol than letting people play driving games and skee ball. At any rate, it's a fun spot for a date night, night out with friends, and I've even seen families there for the food and games, so all in all, this is a pretty good, well-rounded place for entertainment."}
{"text":"AVOID! JUST DON'T EVEN TRY TO COME HERE.   It seems as if the place is going out of business. We had to pick 3-4 different entrees before we landed on something they had. They were out of most foods and didn't notify us until 45-60 minutes after we ordered when they delivered the rest of the food to our party that they didn't have the tacos my wife ordered.   Asked to speak to a manager. She walked away while I was still speaking. Had to seek out a second manager who admitted that corporate didn't provide them with the funds to run the place properly and understood our dissatisfaction. Only positive thing I can say is that the second manager was professional and comped (sp?) our meal.    Feel bad for the employees because this place will be closed if they don't turn it around.   But you should avoid this place. Go anywhere else. Anywhere. Even McD's."}
{"text":"A fun place to drink and play games. The nightlife to be skewed towards an older crowd, so it's not the most happening place, but it's still fun to visit every once in a while."}
{"text":"Interesting place that has a wide range of entertainment.  Dinner, bowling, music, live bands, cigar bars, drinking bars, arcade games (where you get tickets for prizes) and much more.  We did bowling and had 1/2 price appetizers during happy hour.  Was a pretty good time and would go back again and maybe try something different."}
{"text":"So much to do ...   This a mixed review of the place.   I will start with the fun factor :-).    This place offers many things to many different people.    Downstairs - There is a a restaurant, bar, and bowling.    This reminds me of many of the bowling / clubs I have been to (Lucky Strikes, Tora (where there is bull riding), etc...).  Upstairs - There is more bowling, a bar where there is live music, a movie theater with an incredibly large screen.    Many things to do if you are in to it.  I went to see Uncle Kracker play.   They are still working out the kinks in my opinion.   Uncle Kracker played and half the tv's in the bar were still tuned to ESPN and Fox News.    They will quickly turned the tv's to the musician after a request was made.      The fun factor rates high.    The drink prices are more than what you would expect.  Parking is terrible.   There are signs asking you not to park in the shopping center lot.     Food The food is not very good.    I have had their version of big bang shrimp (shrimp with a tempura batter, deep fried), seared ahi tuna, and nachos.    Shrimp and ahi tuna will only be ordered again after providing the wait staff special instructions (cook / sear).   The nachos are really bad.   Thin chips with movie quality cheese sauce (They are cheap).  I will go back if I am with a group for drinks (decent beer selection) and live music.   I will not dine there - they should remove the restaurant and put in another bar / feature live acoustic acts.  Summary: Fun Events:  Good / Fun.    Prices: Pre-made Long Islands were $9 per... pretty expensive   Beers run $5-7. Food:  Bad.  Order at your own risk. Service:  Good until they get busy.   The staff when I have been there have been overwhelmed or disorganized. Parking:  Terrible  Overall - I give it a below fair rating hoping they will improve."}
{"text":"It started out really fun.  Bowling, Games, Movies, Comedy club, Food... Then something happened. Rumor has it that the management changed hands.  From there it went down hill.  Still lots to do, but the service is just so so, and the food is not even as good as Eat n Park.  The comedy club is not fun or funny. I joined the Blue membership level a year ago, and just canceled because we really didn't want to go there any more.  If I want to go bowling, I can go to my local AMF lanes, or others, as they all have food and drink now, at much better prices and service. If I want comedy, there are MUCH better places to go in PGH. Sorry Latitude 360, its just not there anymore..."}
{"text":"I just read a comment from yesterday that I echoes my thoughts as well. It's as if this place is going out of business at any moment. I went through no less than 6 different items on the menu before finding one that they had. Things were filthy through-out, many, many things were broken. Leaving preparing to dispute the charges for membership since they aren't providing the facility or services that they're advertising. Details below...  We had come to have dinner and bowl. We didn't make a lane reservation (which I accept fully) and came ready to wait. The problem is that we were told 40 minutes when walking in. After dinner I asked where we were in line and was told that we were next. We tried to go to the arcade to spend some time (and money) . When walking into the \"arcade\" we found that over half of the machines were either off or the card scanners didn't work. Nearly all of the prize machines were empty and the ticket redemption room was closed and had nearly no stock anyway (I may have seen a tumbleweed blow by). We went back to check on bowling since it had been 30 more minutes and was told it would be another 20 or 30 minutes. I looked at the lanes on the ground floor and there were 6 open. I was told that they were all broken... For those keeping tally, that's about half the arcade games and 6 of the bowling lanes inoperable and terrible availability on the menu. I should also add that we went through 3 high-chairs before we found one that wasn't too broken to use (but still broken, mind you)  The cleanliness... Garbage under our booth, glassware in the women's bathrooms along with toilet paper all over the floor in both the men's and women's bathrooms. The arcade display case had empty beer bottles in it along with half finished cups and pitchers ready for less supervised kids to get into.   Bottom line: Staff: Literally ALL of the staff we came in contact with seemed to be miserable. The people staffing the bowing counter were condescending with poor communication skills and didn't seem to understand what the word 'next' means. For a customer-facing position, I can't stress enough how poor the communication skills were. During dinner, the waitress and hostess seemed to just want to get rid of us ASAP. The concierge at the front was nice though.   Facility: Feels like half of everything is broken in the arcade and bowling lanes. Pretty sad level of cleanliness. Look at the pictures in other posts, a week later and exactly the same.   Food: Very poor availability of menu items. Had to settle on pizza and the four cheese and pepperoni and cheese came out with near Vincent's level grease on the pizza, which is good and expected at VINCENT'S, not ideal for kiddy consumption. Bright spot: Fried pickles.   Edit: So after reading reviews it's obvious that this place took a nosedive around October 2015, which is a shame because the facility itself has serious potential. It appears this this precipitous decline is directly tied to their corporate leadership and the site not having any budget to keep the facility and amenities up. Hopefully they get their $%!# straight for sake of the jobs involved. Pittsburgh is the last of 4 sites remaining open."}
{"text":"I created a Yelp account solely to write this review.......  -Waited 25+ minutes for a waitress to take our order -Service was absolutely terrible--group of wait-staff stood around talking while we waited to order -Waitresses were rude and unprofessional/inexperienced--dropped glasses/trays/plates 3 different times causing a huge commotion -Food was overpriced and not good--cheese wasn't even melted on nachos -VERY loud, couldn't hold a conversation with people 3 feet in front of me at my table -Bartender had a bloody finger and continued to serve people with a napkin wrapped around her hand as a bandaid.  Disgusting.    All in all, I was completely disappointed in Latitude 40 and wouldn't suggest it to anyone.  If the terrible service and management continues as it was the other night, this place will be out of business in a matter of months."}
{"text":"Everything that could be wrong was! This was our First time there tonight. Half the bowling lanes were broken. So, we waited 2 hours to bowl, after dealing with one very rude and sarcastic employee. He complained it wasn't really his job to check people into bowling. The kiosks for the game cards were all broken, 70% of the arcade games were broken. The redemption room for tickets looked ramshackle, mostly empty, roped off with a sign saying save your tickets for another time closed. I then ordered nachos while finally bowling and had the ends of the green onions (with roots growing out of them) mixed into my nachos. Bowling is limited to 1 hour and shuts done after that hour even if your in the middle of a game. Bathrooms smelled and had no toilet  paper, soap or paper towels. So I told the staff about the bathrooms so they were aware. An hour later, I went back to the bathroom. The paper towels were stacked on top of the holders and still no soap. Overall looks run down, and way too many things wrong. My friends and I will never go back."}
{"text":"I was nothing but pleased with my experience at Latitude 40 and with their staff. I planned a last minute surprise birthday get together for my husband that needed to accommodate 30 people, and Latitude 40 was not only able to do that but they also typed up a special menu for us and allowed us to do separate checks. The food was fabulous! The room was quiet and private, and they gave each person a free movie pass! Ashley helped me coordinate everything and our server Kerri was very helpful!"}
{"text":"This place is huuuge like a mall- I came here with my neighbor, walking in- it had soo much entertainment. Definitely really cool- like a more developed dave and busters.   Of course it was extremely clean, looked brand new. Stocked with a full arcade, movie theater, and bowling alley it is quite unique for a restaurant/bar. Cool feel.   The menu was simply too large for me, I couldnt decide, luckily our waitress was quite patient. Ended up getting the shrimp poyboy and it wasn't my favorite honestly, but at the same time the food was decent. It just was not anything major.   We didnt play any video games or watch any movie- so I am merely rating my experience of food.   I would definitely return and try something different and play around for a couple hours. definitely has some potential."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now so I feel well-equipped to give this place a review.  First time a group of us met for some apps, drinks and bowling.  The food is typical bar fare and the wine we ordered was decent.  Don't expect 5 star dining but it's solid for what they're trying to do.  Bowling was pricey for 2 hours but I guess in a place like this they are selling the \"experience\" rather than just the bowling.  I would knock it down 1-2 stars for this but my second experience redeemed them a bit.  The second visit we went for a comedy show and we ordered drinks and food.  As mentioned earlier, the food is solid, nothing out of the ordinary but good bar food.  They have a heavy hand when pouring wine so each glass was like having 1 1/2 glasses of wine!  Also I really enjoyed the comedy show and pleasantly surprised that a place like this (out in the 'burbs) attracts decent acts.    All in all, I think Latitude 40 is what you make of it - it's like a chameleon and can change to your whims and fancies for the evening."}
{"text":"Went to cigar lounge, glad I brought my own cigars, it took 30 minutes for wait staff to recgonize I was back there, ordered drink had to find type of liquior took another 10 minutes to get that, food was ok came quicker than the drink."}
{"text":"We had dinner, played in the arcade, and danced to an awesome band, everything was awesome... We plan on going back again, maybe taking the kids next time..."}
{"text":"Nothing works in this place. Half the bowling alleys are down, half the games are broken, the game card machines are dead, the employees look like they smoked something. This place is horrible."}
{"text":"This place was out of the way. Drinks were expensive (2 for $14 mixed drinks). Food looked expensive but I didn't try any of it to say if it was worth the price. I'd only go back if they had a good happy hour deal."}
{"text":"First off, this is a great place to watch any Pittsburgh game and the drinks are good. However if you are going for food I would stay away. The food is terrible. If you can't even cook a slider burger the whole way through, how are you a chef? It was completely raw. My first experience eating there I had a black and bleu burger. Completely lacking seasoning. Their fries are good. And that's about it. I'd go to watch a game and have an ice cold beer. That's about all they have going for them."}
{"text":"Tried to come in with an opened mind.  3 of 6 urinals were out of order, a large portion of games out of order.  Ran out of glasses at 745 and started serving drinks in miscellaneously colored solo cups.  Heard this is the last of chain, doubt it will be for long.  Place is a dump.  Pizza came out after waiting for well over an hour accompanied by a huge hair.  Half the people in our party never even got their food so the place didn't charge anyone in our party over over 30 people for their dinner.  At no point did a manager ever come apologize or attempt to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"Upon arriving as a rookie to this spot, Latitude 360 is quite impressive. This joint is huge! Two levels of bowling, full arcade, large stage for live bands & comedy shows, two full bars and a large dining area.  I attended a work holiday party on a Thursday & to my delight, Thursdays are ladies night! They had vendors inside the front door selling jewelry, clothing & kitchen products. Ladies bowl free (if you don't reserve a lane in advance) and shoe rentals are half off. The bar also has drink and food specials during Happy Hour. I was meeting 5 other people and after we got a drink at the bar, we were able to snag a lane upstairs. Sounds like all the ingredients for a great night, right? It had potential, I'll give it that. Unfortunately, the following events occurred and I couldn't justify a rating above 2 stars...  1) After we settled into our lane and plugged our names into the computer, we were booted. Management told us that there was a miscommunication and our lane was previously reserved for a party. They gave us one game for free but with two paid for, a third made the night too late & a free drink or appetizer would have been a better option.  2) We moved downstairs into our new lane and started our game. There were only XS bowling balls at our lane. Only one out of our six could fit her fingers in it. We spoke with the manager and he said they don't have a separate stash. Whatever they have on the floor is the only selection so we had to ask our neighbors to use their bowling balls. On top of that, the pin sweeper broke every few bowls and we had to reset the turn. The pin sweeper also spit out a pin or two onto the middle of the lane & we had to wait for them to spin to the gutter before bowling our turn. 3) We had to request food and drink service to our lane since no one checked in. When our food arrived, we weren't given silverware, napkins or extra plates. The drinks were served quickly but weak on the quality. The mixed drinks tasted watered down.   Due to those events, we didn't have time to play another game. I had a lot of fun with my group but overall, I was disappointed with my first experience at Latitude. I'll probably go back for a special event but I won't place them on the top of my list for a night out with friends."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Latitude 40 when it first opened, but I was very let down upon my first visit.   A group of friends and I went to watch a Penguin game on a Saturday afternoon. The atmosphere was fun for a game, the drink special was decent ($2 Miller Lite drafts), our waitress was friendly, but the food was terrible and overpriced.  We ordered Nachos, the appetizer sampler platter, and chicken fingers. The nachos were nothing special-- chips, cheese, jalapenos, sour cream, and scallions. The appetizer platter had buffalo chicken dip, onion rings, and 10 wings-- not worth the $20. The chicken fingers were the best thing we ordered, but really how can you mess up frozen chicken fingers?! Our food took over an hour from the time we ordered."}
{"text":"We are always looking for a new and fun place for out family to hang out. Tonight we checked out Latitude 40. It's a bit overwhelming when you walk in the door. We told them that we wanted to have dinner. The had 2 choices -1) 360 Grill or 2) eating and bowling. We chose 360 Grill.  The Grill has booths and tables. It has a modern, relaxed vibe with low lighting. The booths are huge.  I ordered a White Pizza and my husband ordered the Fish and Chips. My pizza had six slices and was the size of a dinner plate. They cook their pizzas in a wood fired grill. The pizza was served hot. It had a nice outer crust but the actual crust under the cheese was limp. I wish it had been as crispy as the edges. It was good but not outstanding. I would like to try a regular pizza before crossing their pizzas off my list if things to order.  My husband had the Fish and Chips. The chips were actual house made potato chips. There were several options for sides-fries, coleslaw, vegetable skewers to name a few. There were 2 large pieces of fish that were crunchy and cooked perfectly.  The chips were excellent. Crunchy, salty, and perfectly cooked. Two veggie skewers came as the side. They were grilled with a hint of Rosemary. They had grill marks and still had some crispness to them.  I would give my pizza 3 stars and my husbands Fish and Chips 5 stars which is how I came to a score of 4 stars.  We don't always order dessert but went for the Apple Cobbler. It was served piping hot with melty icecream on top. The cobbler was dense and had a lot of apples. It was so good I wish I had skipped dinner and gone straight for dessert.  After eating we should have gone to the line dancing lessons that were offered to dance off the calories but instead we walk around and checked out the arcade, movie theater, and bowling. It's definitely a fun place with good food."}
{"text":"I went there for happy hour with some friends and the service was awesome and everyone was super nice. We got an appetizer to snack on and it was really good! But I gave a lower score because their happy hour sign says martinis and I specifically came to get one but when I asked her which were on happy hour she said they got rid of those. I was confused on why they just don't change their sign and was very disappointed about it."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! It can get pretty loud and crowded on weekends. So much to do! Bowling, video games, tons of huge TVs for watching the game, a comedy club, a full restaurant, and a movie theatre. We had our son's bday party here. It was great!"}
{"text":"Latitude 40 or Latitude 360 seems to be just as confused about their name as the rest of the facility. I have been here a handful of times and I generally think of it as a more upscale Dave & Busters with a little more to offer.  The food is really hit and miss. Generally It's pretty average but they have some dishes that are excellent too.  The pricing of the games in the arcade are done via a point system which makes it very difficult to know how much you're spending. On the flip side you have a play card that tracks all your tickets and points you can use over and over again refilling easy and tracking what you spent and earned.  The selection of the games in the arcade is pretty diverse, nothing ground breaking but they seem very well maintained with a lack luster prize selection.  Bowling while I have never done it there looks like a blast, but the pricing for it is insane. Latitude has a lot to offer but they really need to step their game up overall."}
{"text":"Food came out cold, employee at bowling counter was rude, and bowling area was filthy!  You could see the film of dirt on the ropes couches in bowling area.  I can see why the place was empty on a Friday night."}
{"text":"This place is certainly a big adult entertainment complex.  Which lacks organization.  I can only speak for the Sunday afternoon of bowling we experienced.  Getting shoes was a bit of an ordeal - it seemed that no one was manning the shoe station.  People backed up pretty far.  If they cannot get bowling on a Sunday afternoon right, what happens when they are busy?  Definite potential but low on delivery and high on cost."}
{"text":"Cool place, service is AWFUL!!! $7.99 for a house salad and $7.01 for a 16 oz blue moon draft.  Will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 8, a week ago. I got there early, so that I could make sure everything was good for my party of friends. First there was the VERY long line. I waited about 1/2 hour before getting to the entry desk. Then, I get to the entry desk and they had my name on the list, but did not prepare for 8 people, only 4. (right beside my name said reservation for 8) No biggie, everyone messes up sometimes. I did have 3 of the eight people cancel as I was standing in line anyhow. The ladies did say they would bring an extra chair for my fifth person to my table, but he had to sit in the isle because it was only a table fit for 4, and I had to ask twice for the fifth chair. ( I waited about 1/2 hour for the 5th chair.) The comedians themselves were great. I laughed a lot. I would have liked it if I could see the whole show. We had a problem with our waiter being large and just standing in front of the comedians talking. He was not the greatest waiter. He had our table and at least 3 other tables in front of us, obstructing our view, a lot. Someone should really tell the waiters/waitresses to shut their ringers off during serving time as well. I don't need to hear their over zealous significant other call every time they walk in front of me. I must had heard this phone go off at least 3 times while trying to hear the comedian. (He made it a point to laugh and say \"it's my wife again\".) The show started about 7:05. I ordered a plate of chips with beef, sour cream, & beans at 7:17. I received this HUGE plate of chips with all the toppings just as ordered at  8:17. 1 HOUR LATER. 5 minutes before the show was over.  My waiter didn't even bring the food to me, someone else did. I made it a point to ask my waiter when he came to give me the ticket for check out, \"Why is it that I just received this food 5 minutes ago?\" His response was \" Because, we have over 100 people here and they are busy in the back!\" That would be understandable if they had to actually cook something for me. But, it was just chips with toppings on it, a 5 minute preparation tops. I was obviously disappointed. He started to have an attitude but, did take it off of my bill and removed it from my table. ( We were leaving at this point, the show was over.) I did tip him 20% ($29.00 for 3 beers, 1 short Bacardi and coke, 1 long island ice tea). I felt like he started to argue but changed his mind and realized that the customer was right in this case. I was happy that he brought us the 5 drinks we ordered in a timely manor and he did take the chip plate off of my ticket. Over all I did not leave upset, but I do right reviews so others know what to expect when they go to an establishment. Last, but not least, I used the valet parking. This was very nice. It is cold outside and dark. I did not want to walk for 15 minutes in the cold, dark parking lot by myself. (They do not have enough close parking) I tipped the gentleman that parked and retrieved my car $5. I have never used a service like this before, but I thought that was fair. I would go back. I would also ask for a one of the waitresses instead of a waiter. I was watching the ladies try a lot more to please their customers and the male waiters watching the waitresses do all of the work."}
{"text":"The service is HORRIBLE.   My boyfriend and I came here today for a \"fun\" day out. We got to the venue, and it wasn't crowded at all on a Saturday afternoon. The bowling desk advised there would be a 45 minute wait to bowl. So we went to the restaurant are down stairs to grab a bite before bowling.   We were seated in an almost empty dining room. It took a lot of time for the one waitress that was working to come and serve us (not her fault though). I asked her for a drink menu, and she advised they were out of a lot of the alcohol on the menu. So I just ordered a cranberry and well vodka. We ordered our food, and the food was actually good and it arrived hot. Although some other worker brought it to us, and seemed confused as to whom the food was for (with only one other party that was seated). My boyfriend had to flag him down.   I also ordered a glass of water from the waitress twice, and never received it. By the end of the meal the buzzer for bowling was ringing. Perfect timing actually (tried staying positive). The bowling attendant downstairs was very nice, got us our shoes, and told us our lane number (15 - which was upstairs). We get upstairs, and there were dirty plates with fries, chicken bones, empty Corona bottles, half used cups of ranch, lime wedges, etc., all over the table (see picture). I buzzed for someone to come and clean the table, but no one came until we had 10 minutes left to bowl...   Bottom line- just don't do it. This place was super cool 2 or 3 years ago. It's clearly gone down hill at a fast rate."}
{"text":"I came here to hang out with friends to have some good food, good drinks, and good conversation. This place was huge! We told the hostess we wanted to grab dinner and hang out. The hostess told us there would be plenty of room upstairs for us to hang out. We asked her if they served food upstairs and she did. What she didn't tell us was that there is only a limited menu upstairs (basically appetizers) and there would be a DJ setting up in 10 minutes blaring his speakers, ruining any kind of conversations. So, once we finished our appetizer dinner, we just moved down to the bar. Both of our servers on this night were very friendly. This place is interesting because it has an adult-like atmosphere with the music and bar, but is made family friendly by adding arcade games and bowling."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday, with friends. Seems like they tried to do a more adult / fancy version of Dave and Busters but really fell flat. The arcade selection was weak and many games were broken. The bowling shoes we rented were DISGUSTING.  Even the bathroom had roped off toilets that needed repair. I think this place was probably nice when it opened but doesn't look like they've bothered keeping it up.  If you are going to bowl, you'll find better facilities for less money almost anywhere else."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not bad at all. I expected this to be where suburbanites come to prowl aka cougar town USA. While the cougars were definitely out, it was fun people watching for sure!  I was trying to describe this place to someone the other day. I tried to say it was like Dave and Busters, but with a dance club/live band area and bowling. But that's really not doing it justice. It's actually pretty cool!   While I wouldn't say the food would blow anyone away, we had some light appetizers (chips/gauc and pretzels) and they weren't bad. Plus, the tap list wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I expected Bud, Bud Light, Miller Lite... you get the point? But they had that and seasonal brews. Sadly the one that sounded good, the Leinenkugel vanilla porter was tapped out, but I'm lame and settled with a Yuengling. I love love love when it comes out ice cold... you can just tell when it's badly tapped.   The bowling was $45 per hour before 10pm, then went down to $35. But you can have 6 (and maybe 8??) on one lane, so it really wasn't too high a price. We bought two hours and got in 2 games and a little bit of another. It's nice that they have servers coming around to take your drink orders too, so you don't have to go to the bar.   I also enjoyed the live band. And I'll note, I'm not a live band person, but they weren't bad! They played everything from 90's pop to current hits like Blurred Lines and LMFAO. In between sets they had a DJ playing.   I kept thinking it would have been a really fun place to come as a teenager. Something to do instead of getting into trouble:) Plus, it actually seemed like a good amount of families were there playing games in the game room or eating dinner. Plus, it would be fun to watch big games at because they have massive TV screens in the bowling and bar area.   So obviously you can see I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed myself. And I'm sure you're dying to know how awesome I did at bowling, because I beat everyone!  Disclaimer: I did not beat everyone, I kinda sucked. But it was fun still!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times before just for music and drinks and it's always been a great time. Tonight we decided to bring our daughter and have a sit down dinner and then play arcade games. The service was bad from the moment we walked in the door and we asked to be seated. Everyone that worked there looked so confused. They sat us at a dirty table and never came to clean it. I'm pretty sure they only had one waitress and it took over 10 minutes to get our drinks. When we finally got our food, it was average bar food. Pretty pricey for the mediocre food. In the end, we felt like no one cared they were supposed to be working and the food wasn't good. We won't ever go back for a family night."}
{"text":"Latitude 40 is just like a Dave and Buster's. It's a bit expensive to bowl and play, but I'm okay with it. The novelty of paying skee-ball with a drink in hand is worth an extra buck or two. I don't think I would send someone here for the food, but I can't imagine a better environment to watch a game (other than being there of course)."}
{"text":"Very cool place! I love it! There are not many options on the menu as far as food. But the liquor bar is well stocked. I ate the chicken taco's and I didn't like them. But the atmosphere was great!"}
