{"text":"Excellent authentic Italian food. Friendly staff and comfortable atmosphere. I had the Dijon veal (can't remember the proper Italian name).  Simply put - it was mouth watering.  The portion was sizeable and I expected to take some home but ended up cleaning my plate.  Vegetable portion was good as well.  The Tiramisu desert was made in house and wow. Best I've ever had.  I look forward to working my way through through the menu.  Ciao. Ray Chesher"}
{"text":"Just about eaten everything on the menu. Some of my favourites are the antipasto, cannelloni (my Italian friends say it's best they have ever had), the pasta fagoli, followed by shrimp sambuca or the lamb special with the red wine reduction. Chef Elio is very accommodating and you can chop and change the menu as you wish.   Live music is good on Friday and Saturday, but I'm not a fan of music while I'm eating and talking.  It's a great restaurant and worth a visit."}
{"text":"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this restaurant has either gone out of business or has moved.   Either way it is no longer on 266 Lakeshore.

My neighbour used to rave about this place, but I never had the opportunity to go.   Perhaps telling, not many others did too.

If they have moved, the owner should probably inform the Yelp! community of the new whereabouts."}
{"text":"Authentic! You feel like you are in Italy when tasting the dishes. My favourite? The gnocchi! Perfect portions, excellent service and a warm atmosphere. The live music on the weekends is great!.... It's a hidden gem in Oakville!"}
{"text":"My husband I went for dinner there tonight it was our first time and it was fantastic. It's so inviting and cozy. The food was excellent , tasty and delicious. I had the Gorgonzola gnocchi which were mouth watering and my husband had the Rigatoni and he loved it. Their Tiramisu was mmmmm homemade as all their food is and made with passion. It's family owned business the owners and chefs really take pride in their cooking and service. It's all made with passion as you can taste it with mouthwatering flavor. I've known the owner and he is a great guy and makes sure all his customers are satisfied. Along his wife as well is right there to make sure all is served. The chef his brother is amazing that's all I can say. Just go there and enjoy you will be satisfied. We can't forget the waiters are super friendly and make you feel very comfortable. Finally !!!!!! A fantastic italian restaurant I look forward to going when visiting Oakville or just to go for a good fine italian home cooked meal."}
