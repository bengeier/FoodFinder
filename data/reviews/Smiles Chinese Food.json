{"text":"Picked up take out - big mistake! I could see in the kitchen and there was a large bin of pre-cooked chicken sitting unattended on a chair. I ordered Chicken Lo Mein. I was given my order and she said \"chicken fried rice\". I said no, I ordered Lo Mein. \"Yes\" she said, \"it's Lo Mein\". I take it to my destination. Not Lo Mein - it was fried rice covered w vegetables and sauce. Hungry, figured I would try it. The rice was beyond dry and the veggies literally had NO taste. The egg roll I did not order was even worse! I will never go here again, especially with places like Dragon Garden and Frankie's Wok close by. Huge disappointment. Glad I didn't get sick!"}
{"text":"This is not the best Chinese you can get, but the price to quality ratio is superb.  $5 lunch specials, around $7-8 for dinner.  Ready in 10 minutes.  Even though there are tables in here , it is best to CARRYOUT.  The decor is less than inviting. 
I order from here fairly often and it seems like they do a decent amount of business."}
{"text":"I love this place, I frequent it on a normal basis.
I have them on speed dial when it comes to Chinese.
They know me by name and address and I have never had an issue with them.

I love there food and they are great with service."}
{"text":"Horrible. This place used to be decent; must have changed hands. Shrimp egg roll had one minuscule shrimp, lots of grease and tasted of rancid oil. Sesame noodles were a pile of noodles (of questionable origin) with what had to be creamy peanut butter squirted on top. Fried pot stickers looked and tasted like they had been cooked days ago and warmed up in an oven: dry and tasteless. The \"house\" fried rice was super dry, again had the rancid oil taste, and had none of the promised ingredients of pork, beef or chicken...but did have (again) that one annoying minuscule shrimp. This is not just bad food, it is a rip-off. Do not let these folks continue this scam. Do not patronize them."}
{"text":"The food here is very fast food Chinese. I definitely prefer lots of fresh vegetables and I know I won't get that here. It's all deep fried meats with little to no fruit or vegetables in most of the dishes like orange  sauce/sweet and sour dishes. The dishes like meat and broccoli have a decent amount of broccoli but the meat is still deep fried.  I love fried rice but I'm not crazy about their fried rice. It's more like a Mexican yellow rice than a fried rice so I usually get something like lo mein without the rice. I've been inside numerous times and each time the kitchen is not very clean. I prefer several other restaurants over this one but sometimes I just can't travel that far during lunchtime or after work."}
{"text":"This place works for me! It's getting to the point where they already know my order.  Great carryout spot."}
{"text":"This place is just gross. Have gotten food here twice for lunch. First time wasn't bad. Second time the white rice had a disgusting smell. Chicken had some disgusting gelatin stuff in the sauce. Threw it all in the trash. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Always have good food and quick service! I have tried surrounding Chinese restaurants and Smiles is always my go to!"}
{"text":"We stopped at the Clarion Hotel in Akron and the Smiles menu was featured in the hotel guest services. So much to choose from. We ordered and were told it would be an hour before our food arrived. True to their word, it was an hour before some extremely rude delivery person showed up. We'd ordered beef noodles, tofu general tsao, and egg drop soup. We're in a hotel that FEATUREs this restaurant and you would think they'd deliver it with the correct utensils?! No spoon for the soup. The food was terrible. They must use rancid oil. The egg roll that came with the meal was inedible. We both feel sick. I hope we don't end up with food poisoning. Yes, it's that bad. $22 + $5 tip gone."}
