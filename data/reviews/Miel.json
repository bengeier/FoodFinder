{"text":"The food was excellent. The menu is a bit limited and on the pricey side (the price of the vegetarian options in particular were a bit high for my taste) but I would say the artichoke was absolutely, incredibly delicious. The service was very warm, but slow, so you shouldn't be in a rush. 
This is not a \"I just don't feel like cooking\" kind of restaurant (at least, not for middle class), but it's a very good \"let's do something special tonight\" option."}
{"text":"Restaurant fort sympathique avec décor simple et de bon goût, ambiance agréable, cuisine presque complètement locale, plats originaux, délicieux et parfaits pour partager. J'ai adoré le pain plat avec crevettes de Matane."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. Very welcoming. You can savour reasonable portions over more courses for a more complete dining experience.  Service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and it only just opened a few months ago. Both times I sat on the terasse and the staff were very welcoming of my dog Jack, which I appreciated. 

It's a tapas style restaurant. Since I don't eat meat, it's a little limiting but there are still seafood and vegetarian options. There's a delicate balance of flavours in every dish and the food always arrives at the table at a perfect temperature. I'm not a big fan of sharing but if you like to share it's very doable. 

I love the artichoke, gnocci (which I believe involved orange zest), the risotto with scallops and salmon tataki. 

I found the oysters to be somewhat overpriced. Since oysters don't involve major prep work, I don't see why. 

I had a hard time deciding between giving this restaurant four or five star. I would say Miel is comparable to any of the celebrated and highly regarded Montreal restaurants such as Joe Beef or Chasse et Peche, for instance."}
{"text":"Restaurant Miel was my favourite discovery this year. This quaint industrial chic venue located in Pointe St Charles is nicely decorated with its dark walls, light wood tables, industrial lighting and comfortable sofa seats, and offers a great laidback feel where you can high dine at an affordable price. 

We started with cocktails; I chose the cosmopolite martini, which was light and refreshing, made with tangy ginger and cranberry. My foodie group and I ordered an array of dishes to share and I can honestly say that everything was spot on! We tried the artichoke dish with lardo, broccoli with almonds and pear, the beet tartelette, duck hearts with string beans and crème fresh, duckling with squash and apple, the homemade gnocchi with poached egg, and scallop risotto. Every dish was spot on in terms of preparation, perfectly seasoned, incredible flavours and texture and the portions were more than generous; we couldn't help to take a doggy bag home. Unfortunately we didn't have room for dessert but the choices were soooo tempting. The wine selection was great, offering a great selection by the glass as well. 

The service was more than pleasant, from the moment we where greeted and throughout the service, our wait staff was attentive and personable. A thorough explanations the menus from cocktails to the food was presented and special attention for dietary changes, the restaurant was greatly accommodating. 

Overall, this resto made it to my top five in Montreal, and I will gladly return to try their other plates and deserts too. Hopefully, brunch will be on its way soon too!"}
{"text":"Nous sommes aller hier pour le repas du soir propriétaire très sympathique très bonne ambiance 
Jaime bien la thématique de commander plusieurs assiettes ça donne place découvrir plus de plat nos premières assiettes étaient succulente huîtres bbq et le thon wow 
Mais par la suite l'assiette de bockchoy la sauce vraiment trop salée et la sauce n'allait pas avec la composition du plat pour le plat de mon amie los de moelle trop salée et manquait un quelque chose encore dommage 
Je vais m'abstenir de commentaire concernant le service du serveur qui était horrible 
Il y a place à amélioration mais c'est quand même bien pour le commencement"}
{"text":"went to miel for a late lunch - in fact, my daughter and i arrived after they were technically closed and they were nice enough to let us order anyway. we ordered one serving of their pasta of the day which was prepared with pork cheeks and vegetables+ (crispy peas and corn, sauteed mushrooms and onions, toasted almonds, and shaved parmesian) and served in an aromatic and flavorful pork broth. included with the meal was either a soup (gazpacho) or salad (seemed fairly mundane - though served with a maple vinaigrette). we chose the former and it came with a house made focaccia. the latter was delicious while the former was ok but not a standout. the pasta dish was outstanding and beautiful - definitely the highlight of the meal. the restaurant was even kind enough to split the pasta dish into two portions (without us asking!).

overall, i was very pleased with the meal experience here. certainly a well-above average meal for the area. will defnitely revisit."}
