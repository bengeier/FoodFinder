{"text":"O'Ribs is a small bistro located in a shopping area. Although the tables have menus in French, the waiter will bring you a menu in English. I had the baby back ribs and my husband had the haddock dinner. For dessert, I had the profiteroles and my husband had the house special. The serving sizes were the perfect size to consume at the restaurant with no leftovers. There was a full bar available for patrons. I recommend this place and look forward to eating here again next time I come here."}
