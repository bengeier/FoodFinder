{"text":"I tried Basil Box last weekend for the first time really wanting to like the place (really). But maybe it was the fact I am eating cold noodles in the winter or that both my boyfriend and I's basil box was barely edible due to the fact that too much sriracha sauce was poured onto my box after my boyfriend said to stop.  But I could not finish my basil box (it took me 5 different tries) since the spice just overpowered everything, and I mean everything. The noodles were ok but the five spice steak was pretty good.  I don't really have much to say other than being disappointed with this experience. Seems like most other people have fared better, maybe I will try it again in the future. For a place that is so highly rated on Yelp I feel like I am missing out on something?"}
{"text":"Second time here, with fantastic service! The staff greet you as you enter, and take the time to explain how their menu works.  I got a salad/rice noodle mix for the base, which is great since I'm trying to go lighter on carbs! I had the 5-spice steak last time (which I loved!) and the lemongrass chicken this time. I can hardly believe it, but I like the chicken even more!  At Pete's suggestion (check out the other reviews), I got the peanut sauce/Panang curry mix. So delicious, and not insanely spicy! I'm super sensitive to salt, so I liked that I could get less sauce and have the flavours of the food shine through.  I also got the Thai iced tea, which was amazing on a hot day! However, I'm not the biggest fan of sweet foods so I brought it home for my brother, who reported that it was still full flavour even though all the ice had melted on the trip.  Kudos! I will definitely be frequenting this spot during my long study sessions."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh vegetables and foods to mix all together.  Not too many options but so worth it.  Not too expensive and completely delicious.  Have been many times already."}
{"text":"Seriously bland \"thai\" food. Peanut sauce was pretty much tasteless and noodles were stuck together. The choose-your-own ingredients concept is inviting, but poorly executed in this case. Ingredients didn't seem particularly fresh either.   Just overall \"meh\" is how I would describe this place."}
{"text":"This place is very well decorated and nice. It has cute decor in the restaurant. I like how this Basil Box has soda's made with cane sugar that i haven't seen at other basil box's. Very cozy and clean. The food is good. I like how you're able to make your own combo. I had the chilled rice noodles with peppers and sweet potato with lemon grass chicken and the peanut sauce. I love how light the food was and does not make you feel overstuffed or bloated, just right! Staff was friendly and food was quick and prompt. The soda's were also good. I ordered the pineapple and passion fruit. I must say i prefer the pineapple one more since it had more flavour. The price is decent and it's a good place to grab a quick and healthier option for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great place. We waked and was created by a happy server to tell us how the ordering worked. My kids were excited to make up their own combinations and everything tasted fresh and tasty. The Thai iced tea was great along with a good selection of other drinks. We will definitely be back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Yonge location many times and this location a few. I was turned off by a staff telling me she was going to charge me for Sriracha sauce?? She told me I already had a sauce and had to pay extra. Isn't Sriracha like ketchup and salt now in the condiments section of a place like this? It was to go and I added my own at home but think it's ridiculous for an establishment to charge for hot sauce essentially. Most restaurants would keep this where the napkins, cutlery are if you want some extra heat. She was so adamant too! The woman near the cash was about to add it (squeeze some on - I was not asking for a container of it) and the other woman got in there saying I already had sauce and it was considered extra and made a big deal about it. I just wanted to get out of there. Have only be charged if it was a special sauce (this is the original Sriracha sauce you buy from your local grocery store - the ubiquitous one - nothing special!). Or maybe if you wanted a bunch. I only used to go here b/c of the gluten-free. They don't put very much sauce on as well - which doesn't always make sense with the type of bowl/starch you're getting. I'm not sure if all employees would go to this extreme? Otherwise, the Yonge location is friendly and the bowls fine as well. I think they should have hot sauce on the side and you add it if you want to on your own (especially since these are not very authentic flavours - it can be bland if you don't add a lot of sauce or hot sauce). It is an Asian restaurant - it's pretty standard to have hot sauce on the side. Otherwise, my rate would be much higher. It may have been a one-off - but they do keep it behind the counter. In a nutshell: no problem paying extra for certain condiments, but a squeeze of Sriracha seems excessive! Also, they could put more sauce on in general to get more flavourful bowls."}
{"text":"The food is tasty but they fill up 80% of ur box with the base (rise , noodles or salad ) and just sprinkle the protein and other stuff on top ."}
{"text":"Came here earlier today for lunch. Very similar concept to Chipotle as what other reviewers have said. Ordered chilled rice noodles, grilled green and red peppers, roasted diced green beans, lemongrass chicken with peanut sauce on the side. All for $10. The chicken was flavourful and wished I got more of it. Had I known about splitting the protein, I would have liked to try the tofu as well.  Wasn't quite fan of the diced veggies. It was pretty difficult to eat the noodles and veggies together because the veggies were so small! I think if the peppers were sliced and the green beans were left as is for the noodles, it would be much easier to eat. I pretty much ate the noodles first then the veggies after with a spoon. Not impressed. Also wasn't such a great idea requesting the sauce on the side. I didn't get enough sauce in the cup and it didn't coat much of my meal. It was pretty plain.   Staff are friendly and the atmosphere is chill. It's a good hangout spot for students. Maybe I'll pop by if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"This is the second location after the square one. I was around down town Toronto when I pass by Ryerson and saw this restaurant. The menu mostly almost the same with the square one. It's only nice atmosphere (modern style but they have some traditional touch) and the people also friendly. As usual I order my favourite the noodle with lemongrass chicken and two other veggie. I like Thai sauce and also pickle radish. Didn't try the Thai fresh chili this time since i tried it last time and it was very spicy . The portion is big enough for me. To complete my meal I also order the Thai iced tea. The taste is different than regular iced tea since they use cane sugar. My favourite is the trail mix. Tried to try different trail mix from different brand, still can't beat this one. Will come back again to try different combination. Well done !"}
{"text":"I ordered through Just-Eat. It was a hot day and I wanted something fresh and cool. I got shrimp and my son got the lemongrass chicken. There's not much meat at all - the chicken is in little bits and the shrimp were small like salad shrimp. Most of the dish was the rice and the noodles. I got charred (not really) yams and roasted green beans and they were also in little pieces so the flavours got lost and muddled together. There just wasn't anything fresh about it and there was hardly any sauce, which might have made the bowls yummier. Anyway, I'm glad there's a gluten-free option out there but it's really not what I'd choose in future."}
{"text":"Went there a few times. A little bit confusing in the beginning since a new concept, but the staff explained everything very clear. You can mix your own food with a lot of combination. U just need to choose 1 of the item from each category. My fav is rice noodle with grill chicken and ask for Thai sauce with the green bean and pepper. Just noticed at last visit that they also the spicy fresh red chili. Really hot, but make the food more flavour.  The trail mix something that to die for. I bought a few for my self also to give it to my friend. Tried to buy trail mix from groceries, but can't compare. The iced tea is more unique since they are using the sugar cane. Overall that a great experience. Can't wait to try different combination :)"}
{"text":"Good food.   Confusing ordering operation when your looking at the menu on the screen it changes to pictures of food.  There is no labeling on what they have on the hot tray.     I would return but will have to check out the menu items before hand.  Food is tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"For mall food Basil box stands out. Fresh taste, ok price compared to all the other choices around. Only complaint I would have is they are very very very light on the portions given for their curry sauce. If you're used to eating curry at a Thai place know that going in.  Overall tasty food, friendly staff, great option to have in square one for good healthy eating."}
{"text":"Really good! I have allergies to peanuts, so I called ahead and they said they don't use peanuts in cooking anything, BUT they have peanut options you can add (peanut sauces, chopped peanuts). So, there is a CHANCE of contamination, but the food is SO GOOD.  If you're getting a drink, get it WITH your food, or else it'll be $1 more expensive on its own."}
{"text":"Great food and many options. Start with cold noodles, brown rice or white rice. Then protein: shrimp, chicken, steak or tofu. Veggies: corn, green beans, roasted peppers, etc. Then sauce: Penang curry, peanut, Sriracha sauce, a couple others. Finally the topping: pickled carrots, cilantro, pumpkin seeds, Thai chili peppers, etc... Awesome meal! Cooled off the heat from the Penang curry sauce and the Thai chili peppers with a Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"It's often hard to find healthy, hearty and delicious food while at the mall, but I'm pleased to tell y'all that I may have found a winner. Basil Box is a great new addition to the amped up Square One food court, serving up Thai-Vietnamese fusion bowls with a whole lotta love and flavour.  I enjoy places like Basil Box where, guided by their lovely staff, you can really customise your meal. First, you pick your base (I chose to go with nutty brown rice, but they also have jasmine rice, rice noodles and mixed salad for a lighter lunch). You then pick two veggies for the next layer. My meal had a mix of roasted sweet potato and sautéed sweet peppers, which were perfect and flavourful.  The protein determines your final price, which is then topped with your choice of sauce and additional toppings. I was a fan of the juicy and light lemongrass chicken, but the coconut tofu also looked like a winner.   The toppings actually sold it for me; the interplay between all the various textures was delicious. I especially enjoyed the roasted peanuts, crispy fried shallots and fresh Thai basil. You can also add picked julienned vegetables for a final flourish. If you want to be a maverick, throw some Thai chillies on top!  The final product is just gorgeous, both visually and flavour-wise. It's full of colour and bursting with goodness! And the boxes themselves are biodegradable. Gotta love sustainable practises in the restaurant world ;)  While nutritional information wasn't available, I'm 99% sure this is one of the healthy options at Square One. For one, you can really amp up your vegetable intake here and choose healthy carb options. I also like that my bowl had the perfect amount of sauce for the flavours to really shine, also contributing to overall nutritional considerations.   Overall, kudos to Basil Box for being awesome, and congrats on a successful opening!! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"No, just...no. This was the 3rd time I've ordered Basil Box here. I guess I'm a glutton for punishment. Each time was bad, but this was the worst. DRY. For starters, DRY. Every. single. time. It has been obscenely dry. I get the vegetarian option, which is some small cubes of dried out sponge...errr. I mean tofu. A huge pill of rice with corn and sweet potato. Oh and a tiny little tablespoon of sauce dribbled over. Just enough sauce to coat the top and the 3 pounds of dried out rice underneath get zero sauce.  Today I went there because I wanted something quick and I didn't even care about how dry it was... I figured I'd add soya sauce when I get home. So I go and after telling the girl what I wanted on my rice and her putting it together, I asked for the Peanut sauce....she said they don't have any today....what? I ask why, and she mumbles something and points at a little sign off to the side....okayyyy so I get sweet and sour sauce instead. I get home start to eat it, and it tastes AWFUL, just plain awful. It was almost 12 freaking, dollars! I won't be back, I finally learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Went in for a lunch date with my sister. Decor and seating layout was different and modern. Didn't realize a meal with a drink would cost an arm and a leg though. Basically $15 for a box and a drink.... at Ryerson with students. How can they afford this while paying for tuition, books, rent, leisure and other school fees. What really urked me was how the server putting together our boxes said that we couldn't mix our proteins and could only get one. BUT ON INSTAGRAM WITH ALL OF THE TORONTO FOODIES, IT APPEARS THAT THEY HAVE THE OPTION TO GET 2 PROTEINS IN THEIR BOX. It costs the same price so I don't know what the big deal is......... Anyways, the drinks weren't that great either - sub par to salad kings thai iced tea. This place is pretty much an \"asian\" Chipotle that's really bad with portions. SAVE YOUR MONEY KIDS and FELLOW FOODIES. I'd recommend going to Pai or Khao San Road for more authentic thai food."}
{"text":"I am giving basil box a 3 star, but it's not a place I plan to frequent.  The concept is similar to the burrito places and now a lot of thai places where you choose your protein, choose your carb etc etc.  The reason I didn't love my basil box experience is because I literally had no idea what sauces would taste good with what.  Usually when I go for Thai food I order exactly what I want and they prepare it the way they prepare it.  This experience isn't for me.  I love it with burritos... didn't love it with Thai food.  I am sure they will do well with all the foot traffic from York though."}
{"text":"Back again and delighted l. Friendly staff who were very accommodating! Lemongrass chicken with brown and salad mix topped with veggies peanut sauce and crunchy seeds. Delicious !"}
{"text":"Food was fine. I ordered brown rice with coconut Thai tofu. It was not exceptional but ok."}
{"text":"Nice concept but even with extra sauce my meal was a bit dry.  Too much rice and not enough of everything else."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place for an affordable, healthy, and quality meal. Tasty too! Of course this isn't a fancy place, but it's clean and a good lunch place. I usually get the brown rice bowl with beef. The staff have been polite and friendly the couple of times that I've been here. It is also a spacious area with a ton of natural light!"}
{"text":"ordered the sweet potato, edamame beans and tofu with the penang curry and peanut sauce. I absolutely loved the flavor! I'm a woman who always orders suicide wings and at least four chilies at salad king so I found the penang curry to have just the amount of spicy!    order the shallots.. it makes a world of a difference for those who find their box too bland."}
{"text":"The location is big and beautiful and has plenty of places to sit. the staff was kind and patient and allowed me to try a few things before deciding what i wanted. The food was alright, Although i like the \"make your own meal\" choices, i wish they has some set dishes as well. For me I feel like the flavours were lacking and clashing but that might have been just what i ordered. Overall, it wasn't bad but with so much good food in the area, I doubt ill come back."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to this restaurant after work today ~5:30PM, and the place was decently busy. The service is quick, lots of seats, with a steady flow of people.  Being attached to the Ryerson student center, evidently, this is a favored spot for those looking for a quick, healthy meal, with vegan and gluten free options. The restaurant categorized as 'Viet, Thai, Vegan' on yelp, which seems a bit confusing, but it does have a taste of the different cuisines. It reminds me a lot of the bowls at Freshii.  Someone else had provided a great review as to how it all works, so I'll just comment on the food.   The ingredients of my box: 1) Chilled rice noodle: just right, not too soft, not too hard, and the noodles are not stuck together.  2) Lemongrass corn: didn't taste much of the lemon grass, but the description does say it is only a 'subtle hint'. I love corn, so I can't knock it, really. 3) Sauteed peppers: not overdone, added some crisp to my box.  4) 5-spice steak: DELICIOUS. REALLY liked the flavor of the cubed beef (not a full steak, obviously), and the meat was not tough at all.  5) Sweet chili lime sauce: just mildly spicy, a good little kick of flavor.  7) Toppings (unlimited): pickled veggies (the type you would get with your spring rolls at pho), sriracha spiced pumpkin seeds (definitely recommend!), and fresh herbs.  I quite liked my box of food! Whether it was healthy or not, I'm not sure, but I felt good after eating it. Perfect meal pre/post workout, or if you want something that fills you up, without feeling post-food coma afterwards. I would definitely go back again to try other things, as they have soups, thai ice tea, refreshers, juice etc. I'm really interested in trying other sauces, particularly the penang curry and sizzlin' sriracha!~  TIP: thoroughly mix your box, as the sauce tends to sit at the bottom."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite place to eat at any food court in any mall. Good fast food, good portions and good pricing. The staff at this location are always such a pleasure. I love getting the chicken with the peanut sauce on brown rice. I'm hungry just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Protein portion could be a bit more with the price but not a huge deal. You can add 2.50 for extra meat though. My favourite is the steak with tamarind sauce or penang curry, with edamame and pepitas :) I like it spicy!"}
{"text":"Being a student at Ryerson, I'm always looking for healthy meals I can quickly grab so I can get back to studying. This place excels among the other fast food joints nearby, which can be nauseating after even just one meal. Ingredients are fresh, flavourful, and compliment each other well. I love the crunch of some of the toppings!  It'd be great if they can expand on sauce options. Although I love the peanut sauce, more variety would probably get me coming back for more.  Portion size has also definitely improved since the first time I've been here, other than one visit recently where my box was notably less filled than other times. It was an outlier, but just a heads up nonetheless on the small lapse.  However, the thing that impresses me most about Basil Box is the customer service as seen here on Yelp.  I've never seen a business owner as diligent as Pete in responding to reviews and actually taking criticisms to improve Basil Box. Pete, I don't know you, but keep doing what you're doing, it can only keep going up! You're awesome!"}
{"text":"Best thing in the mall!  I've had the tofu and the chicken, I like the chicken more, doesn't mean the tofu wasn't good. The spiciest sauce is my favorite, they know how to do it! The veggies are fresh. You don't feel guilty after eating their food! Staff is friendly, The price isn't bad at all.  Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly and fast at taking orders. Prices are fair and definitely uses good quality ingredients. I love how you can tailor your bowl based on what you like. My go-to is usually 1/2 salad and 1/2 rice noodles with shrimp/chicken. They have an amazing variety of sauces to choose from! I love how you can customize your order- you can even add different sauces!  Very comfortable atmosphere. Always kept clean and nobody every rushes you to leave. A great place to catch up with some friends or even to come here to eat by yourself!   Definitely my \"go-to\" when I am in the area and want to grab something healthy!"}
{"text":"Simply DELICIOUS! It was my first time here and the lady at the front explained everything to me in detail and provided recommendations and let me know what was most popular. She was such a delight! Great food and customer service. Try it!"}
{"text":"Their vegetarian options only includes dried up tofu. Not cool. I feel like this restaurant is trying to be fancy but isn't. They need to add more menu options"}
{"text":"Canadian beef and Ontario Motor Vehicles License, huh?  I can't say enough about the food quality from this mall food court location.  I'd seen the Yelp recommendations while working near Basil Box and couldn't wait to try it.  Approaching the food court stall I surveyed the menu board which reads form right to left.  The set up is a 'Chipotle' line where you move from right to left.  Couldn't decide from all the goodness so I approached the server and told her I would go with her recommendations.  She recommended the cold noodles.  I chose the chopped green beans and sweet potatoes.  For protein the next person going down the line said, 'definitely try the beef.'  I can't recall the sauce they advised but it was the 'a little spicy' choice.  The servers were very helpful and patient.  I didn't feel rushed during the ordering process.  For a drink I got bottled mango.  Seems it was lightly carbonated and not too sweet, very tasty and refreshing.  My overall impression was the fantastic food quality.  The beef was amazing!  My husband buys beef for a fortune in the States.  The Basil Box beef was just as good and perfectly cooked with a bit of pink in the middle.  The veggies and the sauce were both perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I wouldn't have a complaint if this food was served to me in an upscale restaurant.  A fresh and healthy lunch with a lot of veggies.  Loved it, can't wait to return.  While walking out of the mall the smart phone pops up a charge for AMEX, $10.38 Ontario Motor Vehicle License.  Damn, my card has been compromised!  Basil Box was the only time I'd used the Amex recently and the charge I signed was for $13.00 Canadian.  Call AMEX immediately and they said type of registered business was a small restaurant and the charge was okay.  Huh?  Lol, okay.  The different amount was due to the exchange rate.  No explanation of the funny name for a restaurant charge statement."}
{"text":"Perfect for a vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free diet! We were first timers and Tracy was very helpful in explaining the menu. Great meal!"}
{"text":"Awesome fast healthy food. Service is great. Choose from rice or noodles and then plop on some protein and veggies and then other types of toppings (hot peppers,seeds etc.) Lots of seating. Near Ryerson if you have an odd desire to surround yourself with millennials"}
{"text":"Kinda like the Thai chipotle. Love coming here, feel good after eating it. I love that they have brown rice"}
{"text":"Great tasting healthy food in a mall food court? Really? Yes! Friendly service and reasonable prices top it off. I picked it based on the line to order and was very pleased."}
{"text":"Excellent location right in the Spadina and Queen area. One of the better food choices you can make with fast foods such as McDonald's only a step away.   The system of building your own box is great, and the sauces here are delicious.   Pro tip: you can actually request for a mixture of sauces so you can enjoy custom flavours :)   A great spot if you're alone or with a small group.   And the mango ginger ale is excellent!   I return again and again :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm so glad this food court has this place because Chipotle and Big Smoke were huge disasters when I tried them in the past and there are far too many old school crappy places (like Manchu Wok, KFC, etc).   I got the chilled rice noodle box with chicken, sweet potatoes and peppers. I topped that with the peanut sauce, a touch of the chili sauce, thai chilies, herbs and peanuts. It was delicious. This is the pefect summer meal. My total (with a mango ginger ale) was about $14. Yes, that's high for a food court, but this is Thai restaurant quality food.   It's a really good amount of food. You will feel satisfied, but not overly stuffed and disgusting. I saw a couple people sit nearby with heaps of greasy noodles and deep-fried chicken chunks from Bourbon Street. There was enough food on each of their plates for about three people. You're not going to get that gluttonous excess of portion, calories, or grease at Basil Box. You're going to get fresh, healthy, tasty food at a generous but reasonable portion. I honestly don't know why anyone would go to Manchu Wok or Bourbon Street when you can come here instead.  The only thing I wish they had was fresh lime wedges. I love squeezing a bit of fresh lime juice on my cold noodle salads."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my mom for a quick lunch and was very happy with the food and service! Love the build-your-own concept and the fact that I had lots of different options to customize my bowl. Food was very good and fresh and the space was great for people watching. The specialty drinks were good but a bit too sweet for my liking. Overall I'd definitely stop in here again when I'm in need of a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch today, located centrally right by yonge and Dundas and Eaton centre. Service and staff are friendly and allowed you to customize your order to half/half of 2 proteins or carb which was nice. This place is pretty much an Asian Chipotle in every way...you choose your base (rice noodles, rice, or salad), veggies (choose 2), protein (fivespice beef, lemongrass chicken, chilli lime shrimp or tofu), sauce and toppings (sesame, bird eyechillis, cilantro etc). The taste was good...light but packed with flavour compared to Chipotle bowls which are heavier and even to traditional Vietnamese meals where there's less customization. I enjoyed the food, only problem was I found a curly hair in my food midway through my meal :( notified the staff and they offered to replace my meal which I took to go. We also ordered a pineapple rose soda which is part of their handcrafted drinks at 3.75..I expected more out of it in terms of flavour but it was more like a watered down Italian soda..no rose taste and kind of pricey at that. I'd give this place a 3.5 star...priced at 9.45 per person.  EDIT: so....2hrs later...I decided to open up my takeout box to eat on the way home..and...I FOUND ANOTHER HAIR in my food...I attached a photo this time :( I'm a little concerned with the hygiene of this place now..its as if someone shaved right over my food..sorry guys...2.5 stars for this experience."}
{"text":"Fast, convenient, tasty and healthy. Lacks variety but that's a non-issue for me because the options they do have are all great ones. I'd recommend the peanut sauce for anyone with a low spice tolerance like me."}
{"text":"I think people have been fooled by the gimmicks such as the cute take out bag and the novelty factor of customizing your meal. But taste wise, it is very mediocre. The peppers were too hard, they ran of one of the toppings and although on their website it shows nice plump juicy big shrimps, what you actually get is the mini baby shrimps. My meal was also cold. I do give them credit though for what appears to be recycleable take out containers. To me it did not taste like authentic Asian food."}
{"text":"I have walked past this place dozens of times, and have always enjoyed looking into the restaurant itself, but seeing as it is built into the Ryserson Student Learning Centre, and after years of enduring sub-mediocre food at my own alma mater, for better or for worse, I decided that I should avoid places that could invoke such memories all together. However, things changed on Canada Day when we were racing around downtown Toronto looking for a quick bite that wasn't McDonalds.  The restaurant itself is bright and well lit, with an fairly large amount of find-your-own seating.  After a quick perusal of the menu (which reads right to left), I ordered a brown rice bowl, topped with chicken, green beans and corn, a few pickled vegetables (carrots and radish), some classic peanut sauce, and a sprinkling of fried shallots and sesame seeds.  The large portion of rice was cooked well enough, while the chicken was cooked a little beyond what I would have like. This, however, wasn't a deal breaker since the chicken was (what I believe to be) mostly (if not all) dark meat, so it was still juicy, and well marinated. I enjoyed eating this with a spoon, since it allowed for a varying amount of rice and topping with each bite. My other companions also got the cold noodles and beef and I do not recall hearing anything negative from their mouths.  So, would I come here again? Sure. It's cheap, filling, and tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here and waited 30 minutes on my order because they \"RAN OUT OF RICE\".  Just came back from a event and I was super hungry. Parked my car near Yonge and Dundas, ran into basil box to grab some takeout quickly. If you know about parking at Yonge and Dundas, you will understand the extreme frustration following the remainder of my experience as described below.  After I order 2 basil box takeout, I asked the employee how long it would be. She said 5 minutes. After 5 minutes have passed, I asked her if it's almost done, she said they ran out of rice !!! Asian fast food restaurant not having rice/running out of rice. This must the top joke of 2017.   I had already paid, I was hungry, worried about the parking meter and was informed that it will be 10 minutes until more rice is cooked.  At this point I ran back to my car to put more money in the parking meter. Ran back into basil box again to see if my takeout is ready. 30 minutes have passed and my food is finally done.   One of the worst experiences at a takeout joint. Probably would not be coming back.   Furthermore, the employees inside looks like they're 18 years old who couldn't care more about their job. That's probably why they didn't notice they didn't have rice until they ran out.  Imagine going to Starbucks and they tell you they ran out of coffee beans.  Very unprofessional and terrible experience. I hope they improve their service here."}
{"text":"I used UberEATS to have this delivered since I had a $10 coupon. I had the lemongrass chicken box with noodles, carrots, peppers, and sesame. It was really good--fresh and healthy. It's definitely a great choice for lunch. I want to go and get the Thai iced tea too!"}
{"text":"Hands down best place in Toronto for good price, decent quality, and great portions. You can choose from brown rice to spring greens as a base for their dishes which is great - especially for those who enjoy eating healthy. Their lemongrass chicken is my personal favourite and their topping options are endless. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"PROS: healthy, very filling (I needed a take-away box), vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options! Experienced great, friendly service. A quick option if you're downtown on Yonge. Popular for students.  CONS: I paid over $10 for brown rice, edamame beans, bean sprouts, carrots and a mediocre sauce. I could have easily made this at home for a fraction of the cost! Overpriced if you ask me. A very bland and Westernized take on real vietnamese and thai food/ ingredients, too bad. Not to mention, the place was extremely loud, I couldn't even hear my guest sitting across from me - we were basically shouting at each the entire time. The cashiers were shouting over the noise the entire time too. Terrible place to study if you're a student.  I don't really see all the hype about this place. The rice was cold. I thought they were going to stir fry all the ingredients together, but they didn't. Nothing I couldn't have made at home though!  Probably won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Basil Box is very close to Eaton Centre and it was not hard to find! I ordered rice with chili lime shrimp with corn and edamame beans topped with pumpkin and sesame seeds. I am unsure of the sauce i got because the worker was extremely unclear. Overall, the food that i got was decent, i wish there was a little more sauce added into mine as the rice was pretty dry.  Choosing what to get was extremely confusing as well because the screen kept on changing, especially since it was my first time there.  The space of Basil Box is very beautiful, its so spacious and very picture worthy."}
{"text":"Decided to try Basil Box after walking past its prime location several times. It has a nice and bright ambience. As previous reviewers mentioned, the restaurant essentially makes the Asian version of a Chipotle burrito bowl. A customer customizes their bowl in the following order: carbohydrate, veggie, protein, sauce then toppings. There are a number of combinations (including gluten-free and vegan) you could create, but we decided to go with long grained jasmine rice, sweet potatoes, red/green peppers, lemongrass chicken, tamarind sauce and all of the toppings. Our bowl was very vibrant from the colour contribution from the veggies and toppings. The quality of the ingredients are good and the overall bowl was tasty. For $9.45/bowl, it is a very reasonable price as compared to its peers (typical fast casual downtown eateries)."}
{"text":"This a review strictly on its Thai Ice Tea.  I had thai ice tea everywhere. Thailand to Toronto.  Toronto Night Market, some of the well known Thai Restaurant in Toronto. Not all of them taste similar.  Some are too milky - too sweet. You kind of feel like Goldilocks and the 3 bear...except drinking thai ice tea.   This location, it does it well. A good balance between the tea and milk. Not overly sweet, but you got the gist.  It doesn't taste like crazy syrup by the end of the drink.  I'd be back for it. In a price point of $3.95  Refreshing drink"}
{"text":"A perfect healthy eating option located right in the Square One food court! You can find all the nutritional information located online, and conveniently count your macros. However, do be cautious of portion size, as they do offer generous servings.  I ordered a base composed of half spring mix and half brown rice. My two vegetables were roasted edamame and charred sweet potatoes, and I watched in astonishment as the server piled them on, scoop after scoop. I got the sweet chili lime, with roasted peanuts, pickled vegetables, herbs, and sesame seeds. I chose to get the peanut sauce on the side. My box was completely full by the time they gave it back to me, and all for the mere cost of 11.25! Considering the recent move of Square One to a more affluent market, this price is standard in Food Central now.  The box was so large that I couldn't even touch the brown rice. By the time I made my way through the sweet potatoes and edamame, I was already stuffed. The shrimp had a pleasant sour sweet spicy kick to them, but beware - a couple of my friends have mentioned receiving food poisoning from Basil Box, specifically after eating the seafood options.  Overall, I would recommend this place, but also suggest bearing in mind that, like all food court places, their food may not be the cleanest. That bring said, it is pleasant to see a healthy option among the many junk food choices at Food Central in Square One!"}
{"text":"Pro: super fast. Easy options to choose from. Quick and simple to get what you want. I love that you can get more than one topping.  Con: options get limited if you go more than 4 to 5 times. Not much creativity to attract me for revisits. Portion on the low side as well."}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical of the restaurant name but once I got there it was such a simple, clean, and yummy place to go to especially if you're in a hurry but you're craving for some Vietnamese/Thai food!  The location is extremely convenient for those walking around the area as it's located right on Spadina and Queens St., so it'll be hard to miss. Right when you walk in you're greeted by the friendly staff who will offer you recommendations as well as instructions on how to place orders.  The menu is made up of several categories you can choose from and easy to follow so you're inclined to add whatever you want, from veggies to protein to sauces. My boyfriend got the chilled rice noodles with sautéed peppers, lemongrass corn, and lemongrass chicken all topped with the sweet chilli lime sauce and additional toppings. For myself, I got the long grain jasmine rice with the corn and roasted edamame, lemongrass chicken, and topped it off with a mixture of tangy tamarind and Penang curry sauce.  Overall, I would recommend this place if you're looking to grab something quick and filling. The idea of this is so cute, I'm hoping they open more locations uptown. Their drinks are also a great addition to the basil box."}
{"text":"I'd give Basil Box 5 stars for what it is. It's fast, fresh, and fits into my definition of healthy. Portions are good but not so huge that you over eat or have to save leftovers. You have many options and combinations that can make up different meals. I come to Toronto frequently for work and I almost always stop in here to grab something quick at night. The restaurant is really nice and well kept. The only gripe I have is that you have to pay 1.50 to get 3 veggies which seems odd since the cost of corn/potato/bell peppers. But this is a small thing and if you only want 2 veggies, not a huge deal. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Wow! I just had to give an updated review for multiple reasons: 1. After my first review, Pete had replied to my message so soon after. I like the care he shows towards the business and customers.  2. My boyfriend had ordered from the Basil Box and couldn't finish his food. So he offered it to me. From what I saw, he got jasmine rice with peppers, corn, steak, tamarind sauce and loads of fun toppings. I was amazed by how well seasoned the steak was, how flavourful the entire bowl was. And hurray, the portions size definitely did a big upgrade.  3. To make sure it wasn't a fluke, I got myself a meal. Today I decided to try jasmine rice with peppers, corn, coconut curry tofu, penang curry (just a warning if you can't eat spicy, it's got a nice medium spicy kick so might wanna avoid that), and the fun top your box stuff. Again, full of flavour and great portions.  4. The people here are very very friendly and enthusiastic to serve you. It's really rare to see all staff come up to approach with such positive manner and be really genuine about it.  5. Got the Thai iced tea again. It's bomb. I should really try the other drinks because they sound really great and unique :)  Voila! Basil Box you get 5/5 :D"}
{"text":"It's a good choice for health and calorie conscious bodies. Very fast and friendly service. Visit their website where they explain how to order your box so you don't have to spend more time inside the place.  Love their Lemongrass chicken with rice noodles. It was more than what I normally eat. Take advantage of the no limit toppings to dress your box/bowl.  Hopefully they will add more choices in future."}
{"text":"This is part of food court inside of a really nice mall....I have to say i was really disappointed with the food...How it was set up is to build you box (pick you veggie, protein, sauce, and the toppings)  I picked -  1. two veggies ( lemongrass corn and sweet potato): the corn was alright and the sweet potato was so HARD..it made me think it was UNDERcooked..I have taste many sweet potato in the past and cook sweet at home..i have never tasted sweet potato that hard and not sweet...would not recommend sweet potato as the topping 2. Protein: lemongrass chicken: the amount of chicken that i got for box was so minimal..I personally don't eat alot and i usually can't even finish my meal..i felt hungry even after eating this box..I didn't really taste much of the lemongrass flavor of the chicken 3. Sauce: i got Penang curry with peanut sauce..Penang curry is pretty spicy so the employee recommended to mix Penang curry with peanut sauce to use peanut sauce counteract its spice. Which turned out to be a poor choice.  b/c the peanut sauce over-power the curry flavor, so i couldn't taste any curry with my meal ..and i request to have brown rice as my carbs...bad idea..b/c the rice is really soggy...it was probably due to too much water or over-cooked of the rice..  Also ordered five spice beef...it is just ordinary..    ...there is nothing special about this viet/thai place..it does not serve authentic viet or Thai food...and even as a fushion of Viet and thai, they just don't please my appetite. I am a fan of both Vietnamese and thai food ..but i don't find this place make it a better cuisine with combining both thai and viet..."}
{"text":"This place is located in the food court at square one. Normally, I tend to avoid eating at a food court but I gave this place a shot after reading all the yelp reviews.  The place offers a wide variety of food items which you can pick and chose to make your own box. I had a lemongrass chicken bowl with cold rice noodles, corn, saluted sweet potatoes, peanut sauce. For toppings, I had shallots and sesame seeds. This was a simple and delicious box and I couldn't have expected more from a food joint in a food court."}
{"text":"Sure enough, I tried the Brown Rice option today (with Tofu, Penang Curry and Thai Chilies) and it was so filling!  And very hot lol but I'd rather more hot than not enough. I really like this place, the quality is good and even though the menu options look small, the flavour combinations are interesting and allow you to mix it up and try different tastes, so there's always something you'd like,"}
{"text":"Good quality food, they really sell you short with there tiny meat serving. Chipotle has much better serving size for similar price. Also they charged me $1.50 for extra sauce, really?"}
{"text":"So first off, I really like the Thai ice tea ($3.75) here! It's really good compared to alot of them I tried in Toronto!    On the other hand, the food is nothing special. Its like a chipotle or blaze pizza style service. I got a 5 spice beef noodle bowl and to be honest, it wasn't worth the $9.45 price tag. Quality was ok, but they didn't give alot of food. I rather go next door to chipotle to eat or if I was craving asian viet/thai based food, go to Ginger next door as well.   All in all, I would probably go back to Basil Box if I wanted another one of their Thai ice teas or maybe try one of their other drinks but food wise? Probably will skip that unless the portions increase."}
{"text":"Wifey brought home the noodles with edamame, sweet potatoes and panang spicy curry home from downtown (travel time to me was 1hr30mins!)   Takeout container in somewhat of a Styrofoam / cardboard hybrid that looks like it will soak up the sauce - scared.  Verdict: You couldn't pay me to make the combination of curry, edamame, carrots, healthy healthy etc taste good with a spicy curry, but they found a great combo of seasoning.  After an hr of finishing and waiting to see how my stomach felt from eating a curry dish, I can tell you that I feel both satisfied and not heavy at all!    Everything tastes fresh and the sweet potatoes were really good.  I'm selfishly giving this a 4/5 star because my gut tells me there is a flavor i would enjoy more here, but since I could not choose myself, a solid 4* til I visit myself!"}
{"text":"How often does a business in a mall food court surprise you? I mean you know what to expect right? Fast food eats by... Token stir fry Asian joint, token thai joint, the token middle eastern and/or Greek spot, the usual crummy f.food lunch suspects: McCrappy, Mr, Grub, NoWAY, Tim Horrible, Crapo Bell, Dirty Bird etc. and if you're lucky.... Cultures lol.   So pardon me for being hesitant to make the mall food court my first stop when I'm hungry.   But then, someone said a new fast food joint had opened in square one that was like a DIY thai/viet bowl spot. I was tired of eating ribfest ribs so I went on an adventure - and those who know Square One in Mississauga that every time you walk in that place it's a mission, like what is this mall really? It's HUGE - and found Basil Box.  Walking up to the counter it's a similar experience to ordering from a sub joint, except with rice and noodles and far less selection.  Step 1: Choose your carb, choices are cold noodles, brown or white rice. I did the brown rice #HealthyLife  Step 2: Choose ONLY 2 veggies. There are 6 to choose from, this is a flaw in my opinion, they don't give you very much so why cheap out on the cheapest option. Shame Shame  Step 3: Pick your protein. I went with a mix of the chicken and the steak. Flavours were unbelievable, but portion sizes were so measured out to the gram I was kinda sad looking at my rice bowl with 2 veggies and 1/4 serving of meats  Step 4: Pick your sauce. You can have as much or as little as you want, most are mild or medium spice, I went with their only 3 flame option the Penang Curry. They told me it was spicy btu again, years of Made In Japan Teriyaki Experience employees telling me that Sriacha is spicy I was doubtful... so I asked for 3 ladles of the sauce - should have known better when the servers hand started shaking on the second one.....  Step 5: Toppers, pick as many as you like! Oh thank you! Now I can have peanuts, chili peppers and sauce on my rice. Yay.... :-/  I added a fresh ginger ale drink which taste amazing but was about 60% ice in the small cup and 40% liquid. All I can say is thank god ice melts into water because remember those 3 ladles of curry sauce? Well by the time I was seated they had moved to the bottom of my bowl and absorbed into the rice. Eating the top layers of food was a little spicy but by the time I got to the bottom 1/3 which was basically rice and sauce, I had drank half of my drink and the heat came on like someone had set a match to a gasoline tank BANG BOOM - right in the kisser!  TKO - I tapped 2 bites after I finished my drink with a ton of rice left. Couldn't do it and I'm proud of my ability to manage spice.  The flavours and concept are top notch in my books but value for money and portion sizes are really disappointing... very much so in fact. I'd likely only come back here again IF they adjusted their pricing or serving sizes. Still a nice new option in SQ1  Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"Build your own plate!   The guy here was super nice and helpful! The line moved quick!"}
{"text":"Food: The food itself is definitely excellent. They have vegetarian as well as vegan options, which some fast food chains lack. It is also relatively healthier than other fast food options. The best part is that they are extremely clear about the ingredients within each food item (both in-person and their website), which is important for consumers like me who have severe allergies and dietary restrictions. The only reason that I am giving it 4 rather than 5 stars is because I was once given a box containing sweet potatoes that were raw and uncooked.   Customer Service: Basil Box seems to have a high standard of customer service, which is evident in the way that the employees carry themselves. All the staff members are very pleasant and strive to provide customers as much information about their products as possible. The customer service may just be better than even the food!"}
{"text":"Besides Italian my other favourite cuisine is Thai. I looove the thai flavours and spices and them noodles and curries. Basil box offers all those flavours in a quick healthy lunch format. Their panang curry sauce while super hot goes really well with the steak or chicken. I love that you can mix and match any toppings.. it lets you create a new flavour every time ! Also extra points for comparable containers and utensils !"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. I didn't realize that you can do half/half of things (example: half chicken, half tofu!) so definitely do that because then your \"box\" will be full of various flavours.  The Thai Iced Tea was AMAZING (and I've had this style before, at authentic places like Pai) and a great accompaniment to the meal.  I got the chilled noodles, peanut sauce, and steak, and would get all three again.  Comfortable seating with large sunny windows."}
{"text":"An interesting concept that is tailored to the area. A very well lit, modern space devoted to a \"healthy\" take on Vietnamese food.   You choose either rice or noodles then the protien, the veg and the sauce. I got the shrimp with noddle, edame and sweet potato and medium spice  Pros: Edame and Shrimp were quite good and the sauce packed a punch  Cons: sweet potato was a bit odd tasting.   So we could get into a whole debate about authenticity , especially when there is a Ginger Vietnamese place literally next door, but that misses the point, Basil Box is perfectly fine If you want Faux-Pho. Haha. Couldn't resist, I don't think they offer Pho.  Bottom line, it's not really Vietnamese, it's not really Healthy but it's pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I've gone to the Queen & Spadina location twice and really enjoyed the food.  Both times I had the brown rice, sweet potatoes, edamane, lemongrass chicken, peanut sauce and most of the toppings.  I found the chicken a bit salty. What do you use to make it?  I would like to see more veggie and protein (beans?) options. I love the generous servings and friendly staff!  Delicious food for the price."}
{"text":"The perfect location for Ryerson students, Basil Box is a great place to grab a bite to eat. I also love how quick they are. I walked in one time and being the only person in line, I was in and out in under 5 minutes. The people who work there are not only efficient, but really friendly as well.   For the food, I wish there were more veggie options for step 2 since the only one I'm a fan of is the charred sweet potatoes. The others (corn, edamame, peppers) are just meh. For the protein option, I've tried all of them and they're all really good. You can even mix half-and-half if you want to try different types - just ask the server! I usually go for the steak, but found that sometimes it can be super chewy or hard. In terms of the sauce, sweet chili lime and penang curry are my favourite, both offering a bit of a kick. I always ask for extra sauce which really ramps up the flavour. Before eating, I always give the box a good shake in order to mix up the sauce (otherwise, it'll just sit on top and won't reach the bottom).   For drinks, they offer some really awesome ones. My favourites are the thai iced tea and mango ginger ale soda. They're so refreshing and sometimes I stop by just to grab a drink before heading to class.   Overall, Basil Box may not be the cheapest option in the area, but it's certainly one worth trying. I found the amount of food you get is fair for price they charge since I usually can't finish the box in one sitting."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, food was just average though, not terrible, but not great either, just ok, considering it's location, you could find better eats elsewhere. The penang curry sauce was tasty but way too hot, now i love spicy fiery foods, but it was a lil too much for my liking.   I don't think i'll return."}
{"text":"Great spot for healthy choices. Food is delicious. Only thing when they give you your protein they cheap out."}
{"text":"I visited this location yesterday and had a really good experience. When we arrived I asked the lady which drink she recommended I order and she suggested the mango passion fruit. Being the rebel that I am (just kidding) I opted for the lychee drink since I love lychee fruit. It was good but I have a theory the mango one would have been sweeter. Next time I visit basil box I'll try the mango beverage.   I didn't order anything since I was with a friend who wasn't hungry but the food smelled amazing. I'll have to go back and order a meal in or to-go when I'm in the area next. :-).   The prices were really reasonable as well"}
{"text":"I live right by Square One and have been avoiding it as much as possible due to the insane amount of traffic but Basil Box is definitely worth fighting through the parking spots for. Everything is super tasty and the quality definitely beats regular food court meals. I always ask for less rice because they give a very generous portion that I can't finish and I don't want to waste it. My all time favourite is the mango rice parfait. If they sold this in a tub I would probably buy 3. The Thai Iced Tea is also very good but I feel like it's on the heavier/creamier side so I try not to have it every visit. I leave with a smile every time not only because the food is delicious but because their staff are so extremely friendly too!"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and usually get the lemongrass chicken. Not super big portions for the price but nice once in a while. Love the drinks that they serve here! Looking forward to checking out their new location at Yonge & Finch."}
{"text":"Possibly the best fast food experience of my life. I was greeted upon entering a bright and spacious space with comfy seating - a great first impression!  As I approached the counter, my host graciously explained the process and helped me build a delicious box. They provided suggestions, but let me do my thing.  You pick your base, protein, veggies and toppings and sauce. There are just right number of choices: Enough to be able to change it up, but not so many as to overwhelm. The hosts were kind and seemed genuinely happy to be there, which is a nice change for a fast food joint.   The food was fresh and healthy, and the portion was huge. I'm over 6ft and could barely finish my bowl. I'd love to see a regular and large option to reduce waste. All said and done,  I'm very happy to have stumbled into this new place. If you're in the area then you should definitely give it a go!   The only thing that bothered me was that they only had a garbage. Add a compost and recycling and I'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all! Basil Box brings a Thai twist to the 'healthy food in a box' concept trumpeted by the likes of iQ, Kupfert, Fresh, and others. I liked it! I had the five spice steak box with a chilled noodles base, penang curry (spicy) sauce, lemongrass corn, sweet potatoes and crushed peanuts. It was much more exciting than a typical salad box, I thought :) Although I wasn't blown away by the steak, I thought the portion I received ($10.67 after-tax, if I recall) was well-worth the price. It took me about an hour to slowly gobble down the gargantuan box of noodles, and the curry sauce gave it a nice kick! The server (Denzel) was very friendly, and I enjoyed picking my base and toppings Subway-style through a little assembly line where you have a pretty decent selection before you. Not to mention the place itself is very large for a restaurant in the Square and there is plenty of seating (including comfy booth seating, with huge windows nearby) if you prefer to dine-in. Nice option for lunch, and if you are a Ryerson student I hear there's a discount that may be worth making use of :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! It is basically the thai version of Chipotle. Choose your base, 2 veggies, protein, sauces and unlimited toppings.  I had chilled rice noodles with green beans, corn, lemongrass chicken, sweet chili lime sauce and all the toppings they had. The bowl was tasteful and was generous with the noodles. Didnt have much room for toppings by the end. Try out different sauces if you don't know which one to get. I couldn't finish the entire bowl because there was so many noodles. I just wish there was more options for veggies. Beware the chilies! They are extremely hot thai chilies and ended up picking them out of the bowl.  Can't wait to come back and try different bowls."}
{"text":"Well I didn't even realize this place existed until recently and let me tell you, I'm glad I found out about it.  It's a tasty but healthy-ish Asian cuisine and I'd probably go again.  So I was in the mall just walking around for a few hours and started to get hungry.  So off to Basil Box I go in the ever so fancy food court.  As soon as I walked up, the employee asked if it was my first time and I smiled and said yes!  She kindly walked me through the ordering process and it was easy-peasy.  So you pick your base...noodles, rice, etc.  Pick your two vegetables, then pick your sauce and any other extra toppings.  I got brown rice, corn, sweet potato, lemongrass chicken, peanut sauce and topped with crispy shallots and hot peppers.  It was light, tasty but filling!  Oh and let's not forget the Thai iced tea!!! Sooo good!  How can you go wrong eating healthy-ish in a food court with all the other temptations around.  They did good if I choose them!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice place to grab a bite. My lactose free stomach appreciated the gluten free and lactose free options. I liked mixing together my own choices and got a great suggestion to mix the hot curry sauce with the peanut to make it less spicy. Would eat there again for sure. Portions are massive!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here recently and overall it was pretty good.   Staff were super nice and greeted us right away. They asked if we had been there before and we said no, so they explained how things worked. Basically, you choose a base, a protein, 2 vegetables, unlimited toppings and a sauce. The price depends on which protein you choose.   I got salad as my base, five-spice beef as my protein, bell peppers and sweet potatoes as my vegetables and for my toppings I got pickled carrots and daikon, Sriracha-spiced pumpkin seeds, fried shallots, and crushed peanuts. I got the tamarind sauce on the side. My bowl was $9.49.  I really enjoyed my meal. The ingredients were fresh and blended together well. I'm glad I got the dressing on side, otherwise it would have been way too wet and soggy. I used less than a fourth of what they gave me. The sauces are really watery, but somehow full of flavour!   My husband got brown rice, spicy shrimp, bell peppers, lemongrass corn and same toppings as me, minus the shallots. He got the sweet chili heat sauce. His bowl was also $9.49.  He liked his meal, but felt it was too spicy, since both his protein and sauce were spicy.   We shared a passion fruit lychee soda $3.75. I felt this was overpriced. It didn't have a strong passion fruit or lychee flavour to it. It's made with syrup (I saw them make it).  The place is big with a lot of seating. It's very clean as well.  Overall, the food was excellent and service was nice. Basil Box is a good option for a quick, inexpensive yet healthy option."}
{"text":"They have Thai Iced Tea! Which I could not find anywhere! And it tastes great! Always get one when Im at Square One."}
{"text":"To be honest, when this place first opened, I was skeptical that it was yet another \"high-ended-vegan-oriented-snobbish-salad-store\". But alas, I was wrong.  After having personally heard Peter, the owner, speak about his company at a Ryerson networking event, I was awed by his genuinity and passion, so I decided to give it a try.  From other reviews, I'm sure you've already realized that this restaurant functions like that of a Thai-version Chipotle. That being said, I would say that it's not for everyone. For the base of the box, you get to choose between either rice, noodles, or salad. So if you don't enjoy main dishes that are \"cold\", then this probably isn't for you. However, that aside, I chose the noodles and I thought they were great. I also really enjoyed the aspect of getting to choose the toppings that I wanted. The ingredients were fresh and I felt that the overall meal was healthy without having to compromise on taste. My only suggestion would be that I could've used more sauce as the noodles were a bit bland near the bottom. My friend also ordered the passion fruit lychee soda and it was delicious! Not too sweet and very refreshing - it complimented the meal nicely.   Though the price point of a meal here is set a little high for the regular university student (~$14 for food and drink), the portions are filling and the service is wonderful. I'm particularly fond of this establishment because of the effort that Peter puts into satisfying his customer's needs. I would urge you to give this place a try at least once!"}
{"text":"A group of us went here for a quick meal and we're so satisfied! They kindly explain how the menu works if you've never been before and everything we had was delicious from the chilled rice noodles, sticky rice, tofu, shrimp, and more! I would go back any time I'm nearby!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Fresh. Generous portions. Need I say more?  Went here for the first time yesterday and lets just say I will be going back. The staff is welcoming and very patient. They were all quick to offer suggestions to make my bowl freaking  scrumptious.   If you're new to Basil Box like I was yesterday, you can't go wrong with the cold rice noodles as a base ;)."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by the freshness and flavour of my meal. I picked up take out for lunch and found the service quick, friendly and helpful.  When I got home, my meal was nice and not. I opted for the rice noodles, edamame, roasted peppers, steak,  with the sweet Chili lime sauce, topped with Pickled daikon and carrots, cilantro and  sesame seeds. All around excellent satisfying meal. The portion was very generous.  I had a free drink, so I went with the passion fruit lychee soda - had the perfect amount of sweetness. Paired really nicely when the spicy and seasoning of my dish. If you're looking for a filling lunch that won't break the bank or you waistline, try them out! They also accommodates many food allergies and food preferences."}
{"text":"Nice for a quick meal that's a fast food alternative. Lots of good seating for if you want to eat alone on high top chairs. Meats are flavourful and doesn't taste like quick serve. However they gave me way too much sauce and drowned my spring mix, it was more like a soup. Beware the sweet chilli sauce is quite spicy despite being the mild level of spicy compared to their other spicy sauces."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, very clean interior as well. The food quality is great - lots of combinations of ingredients. Best of all - it's healthy and you know what you're getting. Love it!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time coming here. For my basil box I got a mix of the greens and noodles as my base. I added peppers, corn, and sweet potato ($1.50 for an additional vegetable) as my veggies, and got the chicken as my protein. For sauces I chose the panang and the sweet chilli sauce and I opted for all of the toppings and extra cilantro. First thing I want to say is the panang sauce is spicy. I have a pretty high tolerance for spice and I found it spicy but enjoyable. The food was great overall. Everything was well seasoned and the meal was satisfying, but not heavy. I also got a pineapple rose soda and I found the flavour nice but it was a little too sweet for my personal taste. The service was fast and staff was super friendly.   Overall I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Straightforward experience and very very fast service. If you are in a hurry and want something good enough, this is the place."}
{"text":"The interior was a very clean and simple design of a fast casual eatery where you pick out your box ingredients at the counter, pay for your food, and then you can dine in or take out.  In my box, I picked a base of 1) Spring Mix salad, 2) Sautéed Peppers and Roasted Edamame, 3) Lemongrass Chicken, and 4) Sweet Chili Lime sauce.  I topped it off with Pickled Veggies, Crispy Shallots, Sriracha Spiced Pumpkin Seeds, and Fresh Herbs. It was a beautiful box of a customized Southeast Asian salad.  I liked it.  It was a very hearty bowl of salad, chicken, vegetables, and toppings.  The lemongrass chicken was tender, albeit a little dry, and very seasoned. The Sweet Chili Lime sauce really made everything tie together -- there was a sweet and spicy kick to it!  We also ordered two drinks, the Hand-crafted Refreshers: the Mango Ginger Ale Soda and the Passion Fruit Lychee Soda.  They were made with pure and natural cane sugar.  Both of these were really refreshing but the flavours weren't actually very strong; you could tell since the colours of the added syrups weren't even detectable in the drink."}
{"text":"Great place to have a quick lunch. New and modern looking with large windows and an open concept. Food was great and if you love spice ask for the Panang Curry ... hell ask for two scoops. Only reason for the 4 star is that they ran out of the fresh Thai chillies during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Chicken and Shrimp and Rice oh my!   This is one those ubiquitous 'make your own bowl' places this time with an Asian twist. Much has been made of the fact that theres 2240 different possible combinations for your bowl but what really stood out to me was the quality and flavour of the ingredients. You don't need a brain to know that this is a great spot for a healthy quick lunch at very reasonable prices. Portions were generous and the service was fast, friendly and efficient. Facilities were clean.   Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore. We're at Basil box."}
{"text":"**Late Review - I went during the month of November  Back at Basil Box again since I had intentions of studying at Ryerson's SLC (because finals). I love how convenient their location is in comparison to school!  This time, I went with Jasmine White Rice as my base, Lemongrass Corn + Sweet Potatoes, Steak as my protein and Sweet Chilli Lime (Level 1 spice) for my sauce. Though initially wanting to get the Level 2 Spice which was the Sriracha Sauce, but the girl attending me suggested that if I had never tried Basil Box before, to try the Level 1 spice which was the Sweet Chili Lime and I obliged because their Sriracha Sauce is just from the Sriracha bottle I think...  If their Sriracha sauce is just from the bottle, I'm glad I went for their Sweet Chili Lime because I'm not a big fan of Sriracha anyways. Plus, I absolutely fell in love with their Sweet Chili Lime sauce!  Though the white rice was clumpy at the bottom, overall it was satisfying as I didn't differ much for my options since I chose almost the same combination. I've been hearing good things about their chicken so maybe I'll get that next time!"}
{"text":"My new favourite place to eat quickin Toronto. It's a similar idea to Chipotle but the food is Asian. You choose your base such as rice noodles, two veg, protein and toppings. It caters for vegans too. It's spacious and bright so pretty ideal for a that quick lunch."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place! Right next to Ryerson University and walking distance from Yonge and Dundas or Dundas Station. Came here on a Monday for lunch with a friend and expected it to be busy but it was half empty and I think it was because their service is just so quick. It's very much like a custom salad fast food restaurant but Vietnamese style! You choose your base, your protein, veggies and sauce/dressing. All the ingredients were fresh and the Sweet Chili Lime was a perfect compliment to the Lemongrass chicken. The portions size of the box was perfect for lunch but I wish they served a little bit more meat as thats the most expensive thing you are paying for. At $12 roughly a box, the meat servings should be a bit more.   Overall, it was pretty tasty and I look forward to trying the other proteins and some of the other sauces."}
{"text":"I've been to eat at Basil Box a few times now, and I've never been disappointed. Always fresh, and generous portions. I'll admit that the sauces are a bit too intense for my taste, I'm not used to strong onion and garlic flavours. That being said, I like the simple ingredient options and high quality toppings. I can't wait to try making something like this at home! Wouldn't recommend spending $$ on the fizzy drinks though, not worth the price."}
{"text":"A great healthy option! Having various options helps when you are with a group of people with various dietary constraints. Portions are great as well."}
{"text":"The Basil Box is a place that offers a custom option to asian food. Choose rice or noodles followed by your choice of protein. Add several other toppings and Bob's your uncle! The portions are great for lunch and I suggest u avoid the hot sauce, its deadly hot and they warn you as well!! Definitely a great go to place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great location. Conveniently located on Yonge St next to Ryerson. Nice ambiance. Attentive service. Cute decor.  As for the food itself I am a bit ambivalent. They offer a fairly big selection of ingredient choices to build your bowl. I picked a few choices that are usually to my liking. Turned out I really enjoyed some of the ingredients but not quite some others. I think you have to come here a few more times to figure out the best combination, which I don't really appreciate since the price is really not low."}
{"text":"Roasted sweet potatoes (diced) - sweet and slightly charred. Edamame - soft Spicy sauce has heat, watch out.  Half salad/Jasmine rice Pickled carrots and radish adds a nice sweetness  Good portion size  5 spice steak was fairly tender $9.95 + tax  If you are looking to eat healthy this is the place.  They have other additional toppings that you could add as well (cilantro, fried onions, sesame seeds, chilli flakes)"}
{"text":"I've been there twice, once for noodles with beef and curry, and a second time for rice and chicken with peanut sauce. Tasty! I don't know how anyone could say it was bland, that's weird. The only thing is I wish here was more meat because it's the star of the show (I eat a lot of protein), otherwise it would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"I think this place is A-OK.  It appears to a mix between Freshii and Manchu Wok.     Likes:  -Menu Ease -Reasonable price -Taste is pretty good -A few free toppings such as pumpkin seeds and peanuts.  Dislikes: -I wished they had more grain options, like quinoa. -The hand crafted lychee soda didn't taste like lychee at all. It just tasted like Sprite and cost $3.50.    Verdict: I think if I'm in a rush and at Square One and have a craving for Asian healthy, I'd go here. However, if it's just a craving for healthy, I'd prefer Cultures."}
{"text":"My first visit here was last Friday. I think I have found a decent 'healthy-fast-food-pitstop' if you are hankering for some Thai or Vietnamese flavours. Don't expect any authentic dishes though, they make it clear that it is 'inspired' by Asian flavours (and the sauces are basic - we're talking Sriacha and sweet chilli sauce straight from the bottle). It's a good concept though, I think I'd go again. The only thing that confused me was that they had warm rice but cold noodles... and I really wanted warm noodles."}
{"text":"my go-to fast food spot!! food always tastes great and the service is super quick. Big and spacious eating area as well. I'm personally not a fan of their drinks but they are unique and innovative."}
{"text":"A build-your-own type of restaurant. A choice between noodles or rice for the base, with other choices for protein, toppings, seasoning, and sauce. I recommend the peanut sauce for a mild option. The sweet chili sauce is great for those that want a kick but don't want to be too spicy. There is only one size at roughly $12 a box, which is a little bit over priced for me, but the portion is surprisingly very filling despite it's size. It's a nice place to sit and catch up with friends as it is a seat-yourself restaurant."}
{"text":"4.5/5  Revisited Basil Box this afternoon after the owner, Pete, invited me back to check out their improved portion size.  This time I elected for: -Chilled Rice Noodles -Lemongrass Corn, Sautéed Peppers -Five-Spice Steak -Sweet Chili Lime -Roasted Sesame Seeds, Pickled Veggies, and Crushed Peanuts  I also tried their Mango Ginger Ale.  My experience seemingly improved ten-fold from my previous visit for a few reasons.    Firstly, the portion size did in fact improve - take a look at my pics and compare the box from the 1st and 2nd visit.  This increase in portion size is further verified by my fellow Yelpers' recent pictures.  Notably, the protein portion of the box was increased.  Secondly, I believe I built the box with better ingredients this time.  The Five-Spice Steak was surprisingly tender and flavourful - I've never had steak from a fast-food joint this good.  Also, I got the Sweet Chili Lime as a sauce this time, and it had the right amount of spice and zing to it.  Lastly, I was arguably the most impressed by the Mango Ginger Ale.  Lately, I've been fairly health conscious (Limiting my intake of refined sugars and caffeine), and so this Mango Ginger Ale was a God-send.  According to Pete, it's made with all-natural ingredients and cane sugar.  It was super refreshing!  Simply put, I've become a fan of Basil Box.  The price of the box is justified by all of the quality,  fresh ingredients they put into it.  I know of nowhere else where you can get such an efficiently-made, fresh, high quality Asian-inspired meal.  Bonus: After the meal, I was pretty stuffed, yet no food-coma.  This is a testament to all of the fresh, gluten-free ingredients they use.  Perfect meal if you need to study/do some work after.  The world needs more places like Basil Box; there's way too many pseudo-healthy restaurants that cut corners in favour of higher profit margins.    Kudos to Pete for listening to reviewers' feedback, working closely with his team, and continually striving to provide the best experience possible."}
{"text":"When I first saw the signs stating that Basil Box would be opening soon, I was super excited! I've heard many good things about this restaurant, and I'm glad another one has opened up closer to me. Situated in the Downtown Core, in Ryerson's very own Student Learning Centre, you can't miss it! The design both inside and outside looks magnificent - very sleek, modern, and clean.  The menu is unique. You have so many different choices to explore in 5 simple steps, and it's all clearly laid out for you on the menu screen. I found it very nice and easy to read/follow. The items and toppings are all really heathy as well (except maybe the sauces) so that's always good. The presentation of the food is done perfectly - the portion you get in the box is a generous amount, there's a lid to easily get to-go if you can't finish, and the to-go bags look great. So stylish! It is seriously like an Asian version of Chipotle.  What was in my box?  1) Chilled Rice Noodles 2) Lemongrass Corn & Charred Sweet Potatoes 3) Lemongrass Chicken 4) Sweet Chilli Lime Sauce 5) Roasted Sesame Seeds & Pickled Veggies  The service was fast and friendly. Got my box in no time, but had to wait a bit longer for the Thai Iced Tea, which by the way tasted wonderful! The drinks are definitely worth trying. I also really enjoyed the lemongrass chicken. The rice noodles and everything else tasted a bit too plain for me though."}
{"text":"This \"build your own box\" style restaurant is great! I always get take out, and they have biodegradable containers so I'm glad they're environmentally conscious! I usually get the noodle bowl with shrimp and peanut sauce, the ingredients are very fresh and tasty, it doesn't seem like they've been sitting out there for the whole day, like a lot of other restaurants with similar take out options. There are plenty of options for toppings, garnishes and proteins, so try a few!"}
{"text":"I've been to Basil Box many times at the Queen and Spadina location but it was my first time at this one. It's definitely bigger with a lot more seating that's for sure. I got what I always get--salad base; bell peppers and sweet potato for my veggies; tofu as my protein; tambourine sauce; and pumpkin and sesame seeds, cilantro, and carrots as my toppers. To drink I got the pineapple rose soda which was so delicious.   Overall I enjoyed my meal and I love how the staff are always friendly no matter the location you visit. Basil Box is definitely under good management and knows how to train the perfect employees.  I'm glad I spotted this location as I'm downtown all the time. I'll definitely be visiting this location again in the future."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm definitely planning on coming back. I had never even heard of Basil Box before so upon entering I was greeted twice (once by the lady in front cleaning and again by the lady who served me behind the counter). I was taken through the steps of how building your bowl works and everyone I interacted with was just super friendly and upbeat.    As for the environment, it's a cute little dine in or takeout place with minimal seating but really modern looking and bright.   I got a salad base, with the bell papers and sweet potato as my veggies, shrimp for my protein, tambourine sauce, and pumpkin and sesame seeds to top it off. It was so good!! Actually surprised at how good it tasted. So much flavour with the right amount of spice and all the flavours just blended together so well, not overpowering each other.   To drink I got the Matcha Coconut Mylk which was good but for those who are looking for something that's flavourful or sweet, I'd try something else. Also love that it's vegan, natural, and local.   My only critique is that for the size of the bowl and the portion you get, it's pretty pricey. For my bowl and the Matcha Coconut Mylk it came up to $21.92. I definitely wouldn't be able to come here everyday on a student budget but I'll treat myself every once in a while and I'd be more than happy to recommend to others."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch and brought two friends along. My second time here this summer and really enjoyed my usual order:   Fresh greens Roasted sweet potatoes and sautéed green beans  Lemongrass chicken (good portion) Sweet chilli lime sauce  All toppings + sriricha   Unfortunately the server did not abide by my \"half ladle\" request and my greens were fully drenched in sauce. In comparison my friends' noodle bowl looked quite dry. I think they should have different sauce portions available instead of assuming everyone needs or wants the same amount, or at least pay more attention to requests for less (since you can't remove it once it's added).  The chillis are seriously spicy so be warned. Paired with the sriracha, I was given a run for my money on the hottest day of the year! I've tried the Thai iced tea before but not today, I suggest getting it half sweet.   They have free tap water available and the air-con is absolutely necessary and appreciated! For $10 it's a delicious and healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"I was actually very pleasantly surprised on my first visit to Basil Box! Firstly, their staff are superb- very knowledgeable about their food and bursting with enthusiasm as soon as you enter the door. I had the rice noodles with edamame, corn and coconut curry  tofu. The noodles were the perfect consistency -not soggy nor too stiff. The toppings were also generously piled on top and very flavourful (the tofu was a little dry, but still tasty). There are 4 sauces to choose from and you can choose more than one - lIsten to them when they tell you that their Penang curry is SPICY! I brushed it off when the server told me that it's dang spicy and next thing I know I was tearing up and fanning myself profusely. I even mixed it with a little bit of the sweet chili lime sauce!!! But despite the sweat and tears, it was very tasty. I just caution the ones who aren't big fans of spicy food.   The thing I love about Basil Box is that they have a great vegan friendly selection. Aside from the animal protein options, everything else on their menu is vegan and labelled as so! It's really amazing to see many more restaurants aware of the vegan movement.   The thing I don't like about Basil Box is that it is not suitable for those with peanut allergies. The  classic peanut curry is right next to the other sauces and the chopped peanuts are next to their other garnishes and it is very easy for their to be some cross contamination.They could place their peanut products together, away from the other inserts, making it a little more safe for people with peanut allergies to eat here. Just something to keep in mind.  Over all, the Basil Box was a good first experience. I paid about $10 for my box and I'd say the portion was reasonable for the price. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a quick, healthy bite ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing find in a cafeteria full of unhealthy options. Healthy, fresh and great flavor. I found it much better than chipotle in terms of quality. The lemongrass chicken is amazing and Penang sauce had awesome spice. Really impressed!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you're looking for a tasty meal that's quick, wholesome, good for you, and filling.   Pricing is fair for the portion size and ingredients - especially if you consider the place's prime location and roomy interior to sit down to eat if you choose to dine in.   Really nice place - clean, comfortable, and spacious. You don't feel like youre being crammed into a sardine can, trying to wolf down your meal as fast as you can and gtfo like some places downtown.   Food wise, it is super tasty! The ingredients are fresh and there's tons of options of what toppings/how to build your box. I had the chilled rice noodles, and you can tell they are fresh, because despite being chilled, they are still soft and moist - not hard and dry/sticky like ones that have been left out for too long.   Overall I was very satisfied with my meal and the restaurant! Quick, easy and delicious. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Neither my dining companion or i finished our meals.  It felt bloated with toppings and filler with very little of the dish ordered.    The over all taste was not great.  Although we were both very hungry, we didn't finish and actually went somewhere else for a snack."}
{"text":"Located in the food court of the SquareOne shopping center. It's basically like Thai Chipotle. It's actually quite good! Lots of very healthy vegetable and toppings options. I got brown rice, coconut curry tofu, roasted edamame, charred sweet potatoes, and all the toppingsw, with a mix of peanut sauce and penang curry. The penang curry is quite spicy, so the woman behind the counter recommended the mix, and it was on point. The service was excellent! The woman behind the counter was so kind! Let me try everything and was so good with recommendations. Really satisfied with the food here. Wasn't incredible, but very filling and tasty."}
{"text":"Basil Box is one of my go-to \"healthy\" food places in Mississauga. I usually order from them via UberEATS, but the downside is that delivery time is always really long, since they are located in the food court and the drivers take a while to find them. The idea behind Basil Box is quite interesting to me, it reminds me of chipotle or subway with the way they prepare the food.   I'm not a huge fan of the inaccurate portion sizes, depending on what day I order or stop by. Usually I will order extra meat or protein, and it will either come in two small sauce containers or another big box. Not sure if I'm just getting lucky when I get extra food, or if I'm being cheated with the small and sad containers. LOL. It's especially quite frustrating when I'm ordering one meal for two people (expecting the \"normal\" portion) and the smaller one comes.  The five spice steak has to be my favorite here, paired with brown or Jasmine rice, charred sweet potatoes, and edamame. The combo is amazing! I ask for sesame seeds and crispy shallots on the side, since I like to determine how much of those go into my food!  They also have really nice tea here, be sure to try one if you stop by!"}
{"text":"Just ate there.  Loved it.  Loved it so much I bought a second one to go.  This is one of the best places to eat at Square one.  + Fresh, clean, innovative, fast, fair price  - Not a darn thing...  I can honestly say this place has better Vietnamese Thai food than most regular Vietnamese or Thai restaurants in Mississauga.   You get to choose your carbs, meat, sauces, vegetables. Sounds so efficient but they make it clean, healthy and tasty.  And no gratuities to pay like regular restaurants.  I am a huge fan of this place.  Thank you whoever runs this place.  When I approached this place, it looks so simple that I was not sure if it would taste good.  But it was, and I will be back next weekend. This is truly a no nonsense, reasonable priced, healthy Asian blend restaurant.     Billybob"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and for $11.45 including tax for a little container of salad, I thought it was a bit pricy. All the boxes are the same size, not big at all, so if you are hungry you should choose heavier ingredients such as rice or rice noodles instead of mixed greens as the base.  Basic instructions - line up at the counter (huge lines at lunch but moves fast!), choose a base (brown rice, jasmine white rice, rice noodles, mixed greens), 2 veggies (edamame, charred sweet potato, marinated bell peppers, corn), 1 protein (shrimp and curried tofu are options for pescatarians and vegetarians), 1 sauce (tamarind sauce is not spicy and is sweet - recommended for newbie Basil Box customers), and unlimited toppings (the chili pepper is VERY SPICY).  Drinks are available (Thai milk teas - extra charge - or water), pay, then find a seat in the spacious, well-lit restaurant. Perfect for lonely single eaters too since lots of window high seats. No tips required, though appreciated!"}
{"text":"I love this basil box. (I love all basil boxes in general but this one in particular). I just love meals that each person can customize to their own liking. This place is huuuuuge and it's perfect to double up as a workspace. In fact, you'll find me here quite a bit working on yelp marketing stuff! ;) Feel free to pop in and say hi.  Ordering here is super easy - 1) choose your carb (I like the rice noodles) but you can get rice or spring mix as well 2) choose 2 veggies (I love the sweet potatoes and corn.. omnomnom)  3) choose your protein (vegans love their tofu, yasssss)  4) toppings (GO CRAY CRAY! Love the nuts and seeds and all that of the sort ..but avoid the chili pepper.. as a spice lover, I literally almost lost my tongue to this catastrophe)  5) drink? They're okay.. not my favourite but they are pretty good. Unique tasting italian soda-esque dranks and that thai iced tea that only uses half and half cream :'( wish they had coconut cream or something   This place is set up so aesthetically and has plugs errwhere so it's not difficult to find a workspot. One more thing.. it's literally right beside ryerson so there are many students here ....... may be annoying a bit during lunch rush or dinner rush. I don't mind it too much though since I always have my earphones.  and WOOO 400TH REVIEW! Of course it goes out to this babe."}
{"text":"My #1 choice in this food court, let's be honest- I'm completely obsessed! Especially if you're trying to stick to your vegan/vegetarian diet, this is your place! Even if you're just trying to be healthier, you'll love this place! This place makes sure you get all the protein, vegetables and grains in your meals.   I get the jasmine rice x corn (I freaking love sweet corn) x sweet potato (perfectly peppered) x tofu (perfect texture and taste) & pumpkin seeds x sesame seeds.   Seriously it's the perfect combo! I love it so much. It's also so much food that it can last me 2 meals if needed. I love their variety and the different combos you can make. That's totally up my alley.  The only thing is... I can make all of these at home for a cheap price, which is similar for all restaurants and take out. Seriously, my bank account is always screaming at me.   I've also tried their Thai iced tea, which is good but a bit sweet. I'm sure you can adjust it. Their mango ginger ale is seriously just ginger ale with a pump of mango syrup. Their drinks are kind of overpriced..   Servers here are so sweet! Like, can I keep you? You're all gems!"}
{"text":"Honestly I never eat at the food court if I can help it. But today a doctor's appointment and a mother of a 6 month old baby left me with no choice. So I decided to take a tip from Anne T and Whitney A and grab a lunch box from Basil Box.   I got brown rice base topped with half chicken half tofu, the server saw that I was struggling with the protein choice and offered. Then came the sauces, there qere 4 delicious sounding ones that I was humming over.  The amazing server again mixed the coconut curry and peanut sauce with 1 piece of chicken and 1 piece of tofu in a small dish for me to try ^_^ how sweet!  I decided to go with his recommendations topped with siracha and all their toppings. Peanuts, siracha sunflower seeds, marinated veggies, herbs and chili!   It was delicious, filling (good for 2 normal lunches) jam packed with nutrients and all your food groups ^_^  Give it a shot next time nothing else calls your healthy gut at the food court!  Make sure to acknowledge the service there, they definitely do an amazing job.   +** he wouldn't let me reuse my testing fork and gave me a fresh one with my meal. He's going far places, that one.  #itsthelittlethings"}
{"text":"I honestly forgot to review this place. Although I enjoy The Basil Box in Square One, you absolutely can not go wrong with the flagship location! The staff here are friendly and only want your meal to be the best it can possibly be! Start off with walking in, you'll notice the little things such as the open ceiling to the welcoming front area where you are greeted by armoas that are reminiscent of Thai street food... Yummy! I usually order the jasmine rice with  lemongrass corn and charred sweet potatoes. Pair that with five spice steak, and another serving of tofu topped with my favorite classic peanut sauce and we're good to go! I usually end up topping my box off with everything because I really enjoy the crunch the toppings give, not to mention the freshness from the pickled veggies and fresh herbs! The entire restaurant is beautiful, and if you go to Ryerson, it's even a better way to watch what you eat and stay energized! I absolutely will need to revisit and pick up my coconut curry soup if that is still a thing!"}
{"text":"I've been to every single Basil Box location because I absolutely love the ambiance, not to mention the food! What I really enjoy is how we get to pick our meals from start to finish as the aroma of the kitchen hits you and sorta makes you drool... Brownie points for that!   What I really enjoy about this location specifically is that you just need to take the Spadina streetcar from Union to get here and you're set!   The staff at every location are very welcoming and accommodating, definitely very personable and just want to get the job done right! If you've eaten at one Basil Box location, the one thing that sets each location apart from each other is definitely the layout, design, and people.   Pete has done an amazing job building Basil Box from the ground up and I couldn't be any more happier. P.s. If you're in the area give the Chiang Mai trail mix a try, it's absolutely addicting!"}
{"text":"I have so much to say about this place! I was honestly waiting for a healthy place to open up in yhe food court where you can see everything being prepared in front of you and can actually feel good about having full choice on what you want on your place.... Er, bowl I should say.  I usually order the long grain jasmine rice with sweet corn and veggies, get the tofu and five spice steak, along with the tsngy tamrind and top it with everything!  If I ever am in Square One or end up stumbling down Yonge Street to their Ryerson location, you know where you can find me!"}
{"text":"This place is like a Thai version of Chipotle (but way better!)  For one price (about $11) you get a bowl with one carb (or salad), two veggies, one protein, sauce and unlimited toppings! We recommend the noodles or brown rice with roasted edamame beans, peanut sauce and lemongrass chicken. They also offer in-house sodas and teas.  The decor is clean and welcoming, and they do have wifi as well. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The first thing I notice are that the servers are very responsive when you walk in, knowing that  people seem to always be in a hurry in the area. The good thing is there's an option between getting your order quickly to leave, or eating in, unlike a lot of other takeout shops that are super tiny.  I was taken aback by how modern the design was. Ceiling to floor windows. Very clean. I got so comfortable here to the point of spending around 2.5 hours eating then digesting and lounging around. There were high chairs near the front, couches closer to the wall, and carseats closer to the back. It reminds me of an upscale cafeteria with an assembly line where your box can be made, similar to Chipotle in concept, Freshii in nature of the ingredients with a Thai & Viet twist.  The box I built had  Base: chilled rice noodles Veggies (2): lemongrass corn, sauteed peppers Protein (1):  lemongrass chicken Sauce: tangy tamarind sauce Toppings (unlimited): pickled veggies,crispy shallots, roasted sesame seeds, fresh herbs, sriracha spice pumpkin seeds, fresh thai chilies (I almost died from the spiciness omg..)  I was really happy with my creation! I loved the taste of the sesame seeds and the sesame oil in the noodles with the rest of the components in the box. I wish the taste of the lemongrass was a little more prominent but it still was really good!  Be prepared to spend over $10 though. It seems like a hefty price for one meal, but if I wasn't keen on finishing it up because it was so delicious, it would've been smarter for me to split it into 2 meals. I really like the mango gingerale and mango coconut rice parfait!  After having some time to sit down, I felt really energized from the hearty wholesome meal, but my tongue took awhile to settle down (I don't think I'll challenge myself to chillies anymore). However it was a cold day, and I think the chilies healed me from a possible cold!   Knowing that there wasn't any guarantee, I did bloat just a little bit after the meal (the inflamed kind of bloating from a peanut allergy), but had no stomach ache. If you have a more severe allergy to peanuts, I don't think it's worth the risk, since a lot of the items contain it!   I kind of want to come back despite my allergy because it's really worth it for the taste (like when you're lactose intolerant but still eat icecream). I love healthy foods like these and the options are so unique!"}
{"text":"Our office catered from Basil Box so I tried 2 boxes both of which were quite mediocre to bad.  The ingredients did not work out well in either box.  The first was 5 spice steak with corn, brown rice, edamame, pickled carrots and radish, and some nasty tangy sauce that the worst chinese buffet wouldn't dare serve.   You would think the steak would be tasty - it wasn't, just a weird flavour and it was pretty tough and chewy, not much beef taste at all.   The second box was a lemon grass chicken - while better than the first box, it wasn't very good either.  I didn't pay for the meals, but i was left pretty angry that someone can be making money off this and I'm not."}
{"text":"Wow...! This place is brand new and phenomenal. My bowl was delicious - peanut sauce was great - and the staff-recommended Thai iced tea was out of this world.  I didn't really know what I was doing when choosing from the wide variety of options, but I've got a strong feeling that I couldn't have gone wrong. Everything seems wonderfully complementary.  Not cheap, but thoroughly worth it. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love the choice of mains, toppings and garnishes of Basil Box. You get a lot of freedom with the customization. The price is around $10 for super fresh ingredients + the portion is huge. This place is a hit with my mom, coworkers, and friends. If you are those folks who like the processed taste might not enjoy this because you can really taste the individual components of the bowl. I love the panang curry because it is *actually* spicy :) ! The only thing I'll mention that wasn't up to par was the limited menu choice through ubereats and the overly creamy/sweet in-house drinks. Other then that, I crave Basil Box from time to time :)"}
{"text":"Yummy food, friendly staff, with clean and comfortable eating area. Great to sit and people watch while enjoying delicious Asian flavors! I built my box with a base of greens (you can choose from noodles, brown rice, jasmine rice or greens), then picked my two veggies which were roasted sweet potatoes and peppers, and decided to do my protein as half chicken half steak (no extra charge!), the sauce I chose was the sweet chili, and finally you are able to have unlimited toppings which include Thai seasoned pumpkin seeds, Thai chili, crispy shallots, cilantro, sesame seeds, crushed peanuts, and pickled veggies. Definitely recommend for lunch or dinner if you don't feel like cooking. I'll definitely be coming back and recommending this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"After passing by this place yesterday, I really wanted to try it out today. I don't really know. For the price of the bowls, they should be bigger. I was a little unimpressed with the food in particular, I had to ask for salt because my bowl tasted bland. It wasn't bad but like I said, for the price, it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time recently, the smells that the building emit onto the sidewalk so amazing that my nose begged me to enter. This quick-serve joint serves a great many dietary persuasions in a way that resembles chipotle. You pick your base, your toppings and protein, as well as sauces at varying levels of spiciness. There weren't a wide variety of toppings, however. I would have liked to see far more fresh veggie options, instead of grilled and pickled toppings. The tofu cubes were supposedly coconut-curry marinated, but I couldn't detect any resembling flavour. I definitely enjoyed my quick bite here and appreciate how the chain caters to all dietary needs. Service was great, the girl at the counter more than pleased to explain the restaurant's concept and how to compile a bowl. Flavour falls short, however."}
{"text":"Taste good.  A nice healthier fast food option. I got half chicken half beef with peanut sauce. The beef and chicken tasted it wasn't too Chewy was just right the peanut sauce however I thought could have been stronger didn't taste it that much"}
{"text":"I decided to try Basil Box out the other day as it is conveniently located inside the square one food court.  I was greeted instantly and they explained to me how the ordering process worked.  I was still trying to decide on what to get and they asked if I wanted to sample their protein items.  I thought I was just going to get one sample but they kept them coming! I tried the chicken, beef, shrimp, and tofu.  They were all super tasty.   I ended up with the beef with corn, green beans,  cold rice noodles and peanut sauce.  I really enjoyed the ordering experience and the people,  and loved how I could customize everything.  The portion is generous as well.  I also really liked the additional toppings at the end,  especially the crunchy pickled radish and carrots- tied the meal together so well!    I also ordered the Thai ice tea- the flavour was good.  Imo it was too sweet but I wanted to try their drink in their original form. Next time I'll ask for half sweet:)   There is definitely a next time!"}
{"text":"Ok sooooooo impressed is an understatement! I was surprised how good this place was! I had the tofu and man was it tasty! I highly recommend this place if you are a vegan, vegetarian or carnivore. They cater to it all! Their sauces were delicious and ingredients fresh! I'll Be back for sure! Maybe even tomorrow!"}
{"text":"It's basically a Thai/Vietnamese version of Chipotle. You pick what goes into your bowl - proteins, greens, toppings, dressing, etc. and you pay according to exactly what you pick. In terms of size, a bowl is enough for lunch I'd say, but to be honest, it got fairly boring near the of the meal. So, I'm not sure if this would suffice for a full dinner meal.  The flavours don't work that well together and I found my lunch very salty, maybe due to how much dressing they had added in. It's worth trying once for the novelty, but otherwise, for the price and actual food quality and taste, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a quick lunch. Similar to Chipotle, you can pick and choose ingredients that go into your bowl.   First, you choose white rice, brown rice, salad, or noodles. Then you choose 2 veggies, your choice of protein, sauces, and toppings.   Tips:  1. Ask for extra noodles, rice, salad, or combination. 2. Ask for half and half of two meats 3. Add multiple sauces  If you love Chipotle, you will love Basil Box. The only differences I see are that their flavours are more Asian inspired, price is $0.50 more, and quantity is a tiny bit less."}
{"text":"My friends always call this place \"asian chipotle\" because it has a very similar concept - you choose what type of rice/noodles you want, then what kind of meat, and then what kind of veggies/toppings.   To me, the food was pretty average. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't super delicious either, it was just kinda average. I think my problem was that after you eat the meat/topings you're left with half a bowl of just rice and a few vegetables which gets pretty bland after a while. Maybe if I mixed everything better I wouldn't have gotten tired of my food so quickly?? idk  I'll probably come back here every now and then if I'm in the area but I won't be making trips specifically downtown just for this place ya kno  ps get the thai iced tea it was pretty good :)"}
{"text":"I had an alright experience here, but I felt it was a bit on the pricey side for the portions they give.  We came around 12:10pm on a weekday. Although the lines weren't long, it was hard to find seating despite its large space.  I got a chilled rice noodle base with sweet potatoes, peppers, lemongrass chicken, sweet chilli lime sauce, pickled veggies (very good!), shallots, sesame seeds, peanuts, and thai chillies (quite spicy lol).  While I enjoyed the atmosphere and vibe of the establishment, quick service, and light meal, nothing in particular stood out for me for the price they charge."}
{"text":"Big, modern, clean space. I was hesitant about food quality, happily pleased. I like the design your own meal format. Chicken very good, interested in trying the steak would return."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick bite for lunch, and decided to stop at Basil Box on my way home. I've been to the Ryerson location, which I thought was decent, but the one at Queen and Spadina left a lot to be desired.   For one, they increased their prices - it used to be $9.45 (I think) and now it's $11.45. No longer what I would consider a \"cheap\" lunch.  I would have been less peeved if it weren't for the portion size at this location. At the Ryerson location, I find that the veggie and protein portions are quite reasonable. At the Queen and Spadina location, they are quite stingy. My bowl was about 3/4 full with brown rice, and the rice was clumpy. I asked for edamame (which was overcooked, like overcooked peas) as well as roasted sweet potatoes (these were fine). The veggie portions were a single scoop each - and the scoop wasn't even full. I chose the shrimp as my protein, and again, the scoop wasn't even full. The shrimp taste good, but they are small, like the size of a quarter or loonie, and I got no more than 8 or 9 pieces. In the past, at the Ryerson location, I've gotten a good 20-24 shrimp each time. I found this discrepancy in portion size to be extremely disappointing. They were also extremely stingy with the penang curry sauce. I was given maybe a tablespoonful of sauce, which was nowhere near enough to coat my food, and as a result the large amount of clumpy rice I had was still quite dry.  I don't think I would come back to this location. It's not worth the money - after tax it was almost $13. Go to Chipotle instead - same concept, but cheaper, tastier, and much more generous with their portions."}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to this place after we were hungover af and needed something carb-y. I've always loved the idea of 'boxes' so I decided to go for the brown rice base, tofu, peanut sauce and the toppings. My thoughts:   - simple and delicious. If you're looking for something flavourful but not super crazy, this is good.  - so filling. I ate some for lunch, dinner and still had some left to nibble on the next day.  - tofu! I love when places have tofu for vegetarians.  - sitting area is so nice and it's not too busy on the weekends   TIPS:  - ask for extra sauce or get double. The amount of carbs they give you is a lot, so you need a lot of sauce. I love mixing the peanut sauce and the tamarind one. I even ask for extra sauce on the side, they are happy to do it.  - you can go half and half on your base. I am not a huge fan of an entire rice base, so I usually do half rice and half salad. Although, I wish they had kale instead of spring mix :)  - ask for extra carrots and daikon, it adds so much flavour.   All in all, I know where I'm coming the next time I've had a crazy night and need something filling. Wish you guys were open late though, would have been perfect drunk food ;)"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place yesterday! Right next to Ryerson University and walking distance from Yonge and Dundas or Dundas Station.There were a handful of people sitting in, but mostly folks were taking out. It's pretty much a customized fast food restaurant (but very healthy!)! I had the sweet chili lime sauce with the chicken, on rice and salad (1/2 and 1/2), and lots of veggies. I had enough for dinner and lunch the next day (wish they gave us more meat though). The sauce was a little less than I would've expected, I'll definitely ask for more sauce next time. I got some Panang sauce on the side (amazing call, as the Panang itself was too spicy for the full meal). It is a little expensive (about $12 per meal), but completely worth it! The mango pudding and Thai Iced Tea were unbelievable! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very healthy! Okay flavours. Wish there was more variety of toppings and less rice. The chicken is delicious though."}
{"text":"I love love love this place :) The decor is just amazing: modern, bright and instagram worthy. Lighting is just right for your obligatory pre-meal photos! The staff are quite literally the friendliest I've ever met; they were so helpful and energetic.   Now onto the food, I noticed the price is a little steep for a student's budget, however I appreciate that the portion and quality of the food is worth the price tag. I personally could not finish my meal in one sitting; I had quite a bit of left over rice and noodles on the two occasions I've been there. The food is not what I'm used to - it's very healthy (lol my bad) compared to your typical Thai restaurant: no deep fried stuff, no heavy sauce. I definitely think the tangerine sauce could use some more flavour though (I did ask for extra sauce but it wasn't enough). The noodles are chilled and not my thing, but it's more of a personal preference.   I enjoyed the hand crafted drink menu and have tried three out of four drinks. The pineapple rose soda is my favourite! Wish you guys had more sizes! The bottled drinks are amazing and it was definitely refreshing to have options other than the regular fast food Pepsi/Coke variety. I tried the White tea Blueberry bottle and loved it.   I was a bit disappointed at the limited side selections - soup, summer rolls and salad. I was looking forward to try the Viet chicken salad I saw on your instagram but I guess you guys discontinued it! Anyway, there was no summer roll both times I visited, and hardly anything else to choose as a side (4 and 5pm). :( Hope there will be more options the next time I'm around in the area! Some desserts would be great too! (No parfait today either, and I had the last macaroons!)"}
{"text":"Basil Box is my go-to choice for a healthy, flavourful, and filling Asian-inspired meal for $10! I absolutely love every combination I've tried here - you really can't go wrong. The service is always great - take advantage of the ability to mix sauces and load up on toppings. They also offer delivery without compromising freshness or taste.  Beware that the Penang Curry sauce is tongue-numbingly spicy, even for people with a semi-high spice tolerance!"}
{"text":"For mall food it's quite tasty and filling, and without the greasy guilt I would have gotten with the multiple Chinese food options surrounding the food court. The customizable box options are fun and different, they recently replaced their green bean option with edamame (good call!) The box itself is cute and mostly environmentally friendly, kudos!  Service: Staff is very friendly and helpful, totally giving an extra star for that.  MY ORDER - Base: long grain Jasmine rice - Veggies: charred sweet potato, edamame - Protein: 5-spice Steak - Sauce: Peanut, Tangy Tamarind - Toppings: crispy shallot, sesame seed, fresh herb, and peanut  My dish ended up tasting a little Indian, but I really liked that. I thought my veggie choices would clash a little, but all of their options seem to meld together well. It's not the most refined dish; but if you're hungry and want a warm/tasty/healthy meal, Basil Box can do it for you. 4/5 star :)"}
{"text":"I like Basil Box, I've gone here quite a few times and had a lunch meeting here. The space is brand new and very modern.  I usually get noodles, edamame, mix vegs, shrimp and tofu mix with spicy sauce. The bowl is huge and enough food to be saved for later. It comes to $9.45+tax. Total $10.68. It seems like a good choice, until you look at their nutrition facts... You can make it healthier by choosing salad and no sauce, etc.  Good place to grab a quick lunch.  It is a build-your-own bowl place, so don't expect the flavours to be mixed in. I had a few people come here with me at dinner time and they were very disappointed at how bland it tasted - for this price range."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to my lunch break routine at work.  Walked in and was enthusiastically greeted by the staff -- likely because they just opened, but it was nice to feel wanted. They gave me the run down on how to order, which is essentially pick a base and load up with toppings. I opted for some noodles with chicken, peppers, edamame, peanut sauce, herbs and pumpkin seeds. I have to admit I was pretty satisfied with the portions and it tasted pretty damn good.  Their location is pretty solid and I'm sure they'll get loads of traffic. The price is decent (around 10 bucks) but a majority of the ingredients lie in the base noodles or rice. There could be a few more veggie options (and you only get to pick two) but overall I was satisfied with my order. Will definitely be back for another round."}
{"text":"Love this place but I gotta be harsh on them for two reasons.   Number one: protein portion is whack, guaranteed gotta spring for extra chicken   Number two: STOP CHARGING FOR MORE THAN TWO VEGGIE CHOICES.   If I pick edamame and sweet potato there's no reason you should be charging me several dollars extra for canned corn niblets just because it's a 3rd topping   Annoying !  I'll update this to 5 stars once they fix either of these two problems"}
{"text":"I went here the other day to work on some homework and also get a bite of something healthy to eat and drink at the same time. While I am usually not a big fan of these kind of eatery places, I was really impressed by BASIL BOX. Their decor is lovely and spacious. You don't feel unpleasantly cramped. It was my first time there and the staff was really helpful and attentive, they seemed cheerful and upbeat. The food itself was really good! I had a cold noodle base, with tofu for protein, and for my two vegetable choices I got sweet potato, which was sauteed and delicious, as well as some edamame. I topped it off with a peanut sauce and sesame seeds. I also ordered a Thai iced tea, which was very pleasant and creamy"}
{"text":"Stopped in based on the concept and the yelp reviews. And it was really good!  Think chipotle meets Asian. There are some interesting options for protein and some great sauces. I would definitely go back and would be delighted to have one close to home."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Basil Box - it's a great healthy option for a quick lunch. I love the option of being able to customize everything that goes into the bowl, from the base (noodles, salad etc.) to the veggies and choice of protein. When you purchase a box, you also have the option of buying their drinks for a discounted price.   The hot peanut sauce is delicious, and goes well with the curried tofu. The staff is also very friendly in answering any questions that the guest may have.   I highly recommend this place for a fast lunch. The portion is also a good size, and keeps you full. The shop is also quite clean."}
{"text":"Basil Box should be a common site in cities, it's the perfect place to grab a quick, decent priced lunch or dinner, and have it be something healthy at the same time. This was my second trip to Basil Box since its opening a few years back and I couldn't be happier with my second trip. This location is right downtown and only minutes from Dundas Square/Eaton Centre. The seating here is plentiful and the staff is always super friendly and helpful. The menu here is basically a \"pick what you want\" type deal and I decided to get a rice bowl with chicken, corn, onion, peanuts, and some sauce that as usual, I forgot. Either way, every aspect of my bowl was delicious and it was even big enough to last me a meal and a half. Overall, Basil Box is a fantastic lunch spot that everyone in the downtown region should try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"What do you do when you are at the Square One Mall, need food, don't want to eat bad, and want something delicious at the same time? YOU GO TO BASIL BOX! I am basically a male cheerleader for this place and it's something I'm proud to be. Basil Box is what happens when you have a bunch of fresh, delicious, and fully customizable options laid out in front of you. I ended up  coming to this location on Sunday afternoon with a friend and I can't believe it wasn't packed like some of the other places (Why would any human being alive eat Burger King at this mall with so many good options around? WHY?). The staff here was super quick, super friendly, and super good at making the bowls. I ended up getting a steak bowl with rice, carrots, corn, sweet potatoes, greens, and some delicious peanut sauce on top. The food was absolutely delicious and equally as good as the locations located downtown. I definitely have to recommend this place to anyone eating at the Square One, this place is incredible!"}
{"text":"I was spending the day at Square One and decided to look around the food court for something relatively healthy. It's always difficult to find something fast that tends to be healthy and tasty. I spotted this little joint in the corner and was intrigued. It really is tiny and there's not a lot to the menu so I decided it could customize myself a yummy bowl.  The staff was pretty relaxed and didn't tell me much about what was going on, but it seemed simple to go in the numbered order and pick your items in the box. I had no idea what would taste good together so I really just started choosing items that I liked separately and hoped they worked well together! haha!   I choose a chilled noodles, edamame & corn, chicken for protein, peanut sauce and Thai red chilis and sesame seeds. I guess when I write it all out like this it does sounds a little strange together but whatever. I don't like that you are a bit limited on the veggie options but hey, gotta keep things cheap somehow eh! I also wish I chose a different base (the chilled noddles were a little weird with everything else).  Overall the ingredients were fresh which I liked and the spices that were used on everything did taste quite good. I would definitely give this place a try again and maybe pick my ingredients a little more thoughtfully and try to make my bowl a little more cohesive and sensible! hahaha!"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from here via Foodora and my bowl was awesome. I got the tofu rice dish and the portion was reasonable. Everything tasted flavorful and it wasn't super saturated with sauce which I appreciated. The tofu was cooked well too. Definitely ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"A chipotle wanna-be:  I walked in with the understanding that this was a \"Thai version of chipotle\". And that it was! The decor, the feel, and the layout of the ordering is definitely feels related to our favourite fast food Mexican place.  But the food was sorely disappointing. I got the lemongrass chicken, the beans, and the yam, all of which they said were their specialties. Mostly, they blandly tasted of low quality soy sauce, sugar, and way too much lemon grass. Maybe a little lime. I imagined they modelled after chipotle so much that they literally took chipotle's chefs, put them in a kitchen, and said: \"okay now make some Thai food\". Chicken was tender, but overly so to the point that I wondered if I was chewing meat or fat. Underwhelmed totally.  Overall, not good. Would not return. Salad king is right across the street for Thai. Or if you're looking for chipotle-esque, the real deal is just a few stores down. Don't settle for this."}
{"text":"UPDATE: This place is still amazing. Made fresh every time, the flavours are so delicious and mix together so wonderfully it truly never disappoints.    My go to order:  Chilled rice noodles Roasted edamame Charred sweet potatoes Half five spice steak Half lemongrass chicken (kind of like this more than the streak tbh)  One scoop classic peanut sauce Half scoop sweet chilli Thai sauce ALLL the toppings Extra pickled veggies  Enjoy!! The only thing I'll ever eat at a food court!   TLDR; If Basil Box was a person, I'd marry them."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to this restaurant. I thought that the process was pretty smooth and the food looked very fresh. One thing that caught me offguard was how hot the sauce was. I asked for an extra portion and it ended up upsetting my stomach. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was very clean. I would definitely go back again but I would not take sauce that had so much pepper. They do have a custom soda that I think is very expensive."}
{"text":"Nice sitting area.  this place has a healthier food option.  you basically build your box with noodles/salad/ or rice, add sauce(s), choose meat or tofu (you can choose half half for 2 items), choose toppings such as nuts.  You can get milk tea and other drinks or just tap water ^_^.  Service was good, staff was friendly.  Food was decent, pricing was decent."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, I think it just needed more meat. But the line was long, there was no more selection. I asked for long grain rice but they didn't have anymore. The noodles were done and they said it would take another 30 minutes. They only had one more selection of meat left which was the lemon grass chicken, but it was still good. They didn't have the green beans either.   The service was really good, I asked the girl for her recommendation on sauces and she said to mix the peanut and the sweet chilli lime. I was good but too spicy for me !  My suggestion is to go not on a busy time. It was overall pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to review Basil Box till I could share a pic of its deliciousness. Basil box has become my new favourite food court meal. I wish every mall had this! It is so tasty and flavourful and not to mention, pretty healthy!   I tend to get the same base and protein but I switch up the veggies from time to time. My usual is, brown rice, sweet potatoes, peppers, lemongrass chicken, tamarind sauce, pickled veggies and fresh herbs. SUCH a good combination. I have tried the noodles once, which weren't bad and I've tried all the veggies. Everything just tastes so fresh and I never feel guilty or like crap after eating here.  I actually have cravings for Basil Box lol.  The one girl that usually serves me is so friendly and cheerful. She makes the experience of Basil Box even better. During my most recent visit, she was mopping as I approached the counter.  When she noticed me, she told me she would just be a moment and went to go thoroughly wash her hands before serving me.  Even though this should be second nature to most businesses, I actually noticed this and it just made my thoughts of Basil Box all the more positive.  My only slight slight complaint is that they are pretty pinch with the meat in comparison to the rice, noodles, etc.  However, this has never really affected my meal experience as all the flavours taste just as good without the meat."}
{"text":"You will find a mix between Thai and Vietnamese cuisine that was inspired by the exciting street markets of South East Asia. At Basil Box, they provide fresh ingredients where you can mix and match them to create your own special meal.  The interior design is very trendy with modern furnishings, giving a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere for diners. During the day you will see this store filled with light from the large windows throughout the place.  The concept of Basil Box is straight forward, quick and easy with a whole variety of different options to create the perfect meal. The servers are there to help you explain any questions you may have about the ingredients. They also have specialty sides to go with your meal such as Mango Salad, Summer Rolls, Sweet Mango Rice Parfait, and many more.  I put together a box that included Chilled Rice Noodles, Charred Sweet Potatoes, Sauteed Peppers, Five-spice Steak, a mix of Tangy Tamarind & Classic Peanut Sauce, topped with Pickled Carrots & Daikon Radish, Crushed Peanuts, and Cilantro & Basil. The meal was very light and refreshing, and I especially liked how all the flavours blended well together.   My favourite drink was their Passion Fruit Lychee Soda that is made with pure cane sugar and is GMO free! You can taste both flavours and the sweetness was right on - not too much or not too little.   If you're looking for a fresh and healthy meal with delicious South East Asian flavours, definitely check out Basil Box!"}
{"text":"It was quite a healthy meal to have at Basil. Respectful customer service. There was a long line up when i went down there.  Very interesting that you can customize your own meal. Lots of different sauce. Those with an allergy just be careful as there is an option for peanuts but you never know if it got contaminated with the other food- just an fyi."}
{"text":"A simple concept that is being rehashed by plenty of restaurants in different cuisine themes and topping options. You choose from a base (rice, salad, noodles), add veggies, add protein and add sauce. At the end, you should have a customized box of something to mix and eat.  My recent meal here was okay i guess? I had the shrimp box with brown rice and my own personal mix of toppings and sauces. I found it bland even though I choose toppings with flavor and texture. Maybe because it wasn't cold enough to be a crisp salad-type thing but not warm enough to be a hot meal. Kinda meh. Also, even though I got brown rice as a base, my box was only half full and it wasn't filling enough for a lunch meal.  I still prefer Salus Fresh Foods up the street for the same type of food, although Basil Box has better seating and a bigger brighter space."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it's pretty nice. The food wasn't bad and not very salty like most fast food Thai places.   Only issue I had was that the place is poorly ventilated, but it doesn't look that way! With the open space and vents running through the ceiling you would think it was. I left the place smelling like the grill itself! It's a nice environment, unfortunately ruined by the lack of a good exhaust system, but I would recommend grab and go.  Update: I upgraded my review from 3 to 4 stars, since the business owner tells me they had a vent problem a couple of weeks ago. Should give them the benefit of the doubt, besides the food is pretty decent!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what's wrong with the food but it is tasteless. I had the pineapple rose water soda and that was fine. Otherwise the food is MEH. The two stars are for seating space."}
{"text":"Great concept for a fast food service at the mall. Everything is fresh and theres a bunch of selection to build your box but not too much where you can't make a choice right away.  Ive been here twice and i would recommend the peanut sauce and the sweet Chili sauce if you're into something really sweet and tangy.  You get to pick your base which is whatever carbs (ei: noodles, rice..), then you get to pick 2 veggies (sweet potato, corn, string beans, and peppers), then you pick your meat. The meat portion to carb portion is not equal, too mucj carb and little meat. I would recommend doubling your portion which will make your meal much more expensive, but if you don't mind...hey! go for it! You can't go wrong with any of their meats, they're all cooked perfectly and taste flavourful. Next you get to pick your sauce and then toppings like pickled carrots and radish, nuts, fried onions...etc.  I recommend their drinks! They do them very well! The Thai Iced Tea: bomb!  Lychee drink: bomb! Mango ginger drink: bomb!  Overall this place has good customer service and pretty good food."}
{"text":"After watching the pride parade we popped in to grab a quick bite. The interior was quite large, open and had plenty of seating. The concept is that you choose the base (rice/noodles), then the toppings, protein and sauce. The items all are tasty and can be made vegan and gluten free. Unfortunately it was not hot (temperature). I ordered the rice noodles with sweet potato, edamame, tofu, sweet chili sauce, pickled veggies, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds and cilantro. Hubby found it bland but I thought it was spicy. If it had been warmer, it would have been more enjoyable. Great view from the window counter to watch the tail end of the parade. Staff were friendly. There were washrooms inside but I did not use them so I can't comment."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan, but it's a good healthy alternative to something similar to Chiptole/ZTeca.  As someone who doesn't like spicy, I wasn't a big fan of their sauces. There was non spicy options like peanut, but I'm just not a fan of peanut. There's 4 sauces flavour and it just didn't fit my personal likings. Their iced tea was also too sweet for my liking. However I do want to compliment their baked sweet potato- it was good.   Decor wise and service wise, it was amazing !!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite quick service restaurants in Toronto. I love the rice noodles, like chicken, and chilli lime sauce combo! Service is quick and friendly. It is slightly on the expensive side, though."}
{"text":"Passed by this restaurant a while ago and decided to stop by and check it out. I like the concept of building your own box - kinda like Asian chipotle as someone else put it. I got the lemon grass chicken with peanut sauce and cold noodles, along with the passion lychee soda.   I personally didn't like the dish that much.. I found the peanut sauce too diluted and it lost a lot of the peanut flavor. As a result, I found the dish a bit bland. As for the passion lychee soda, I really didn't like it. It tasted like cough medicine to me and I didn't really taste the flavors advertised.   It's all personal preference but I don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"In a blurry sea of choices upon choices in Square One's food court, the Basil Box corner blends into the crowd at first, but its options, extremely friendly service, and food quality definitely stand out. Located beside Jimmy The Greek, there's no reason you shouldn't check it out, at least once.   I visited on a weekday afternoon and was greeted instantly with a personable, welcoming smile (how often do you see that in a busy food court, really?). Like others have mentioned, they're very generous with the sampling, so you can figure out exactly what you want. Here's how it works:  Step 1: Choose 1 base from: Long Grain Jasmine Rice, Short Grain Brown Rice, Chilled Noodles, or Salad. Step 2: Choose 2 veggies from: Corn, Peppers, Green Beans, Sweet Potatoes Step 3: Choose 1 meat from: Lemongrass Chicken, Steak, Shrimp, Coconut Curry Tofu Step 4: Choose 1 sauce from: Classic Peanut, Sriracha Sauce, Sweet Chili Lime, Penang Curry (and an additional option I can't remember) Step 5: Choose an Unlimited number of toppings from:  sesame seeds, pickled veggies, various herbs, crushed peanuts, among others.  I ordered the Short Grain Brown Rice, with Green Beans and Sweet Potatoes, with Coconut Curry Tofu, Penang Curry Sauce, and all toppings. The portions were generous, the flavours were strong and tasty, and everything felt and tasted fresh. I also had the Lychee Soda (if I had one issue, its that their drinks are a bit pricey) - which was also fresh and delicious.  Overall, in a sea of greasy options, this isn't a bad choice at all. I'll definitely be back.  For my box of food, in addition to the Lychee Soda, I paid around $14.00."}
{"text":"Basil Box is slightly like food court style ordering where you choose your grains, veggies, and meats, but they cater to a more healthy crowd as their foods are less greasy.   I ordered by box with brown rice, sweet potatoes and corn, 5-spice beef, peanut sauce, and topped with sesame seeds, peanuts, and crispy shallots. The portion size was decent given that the meal for lunch cost slightly over $10. However, I find overall the meal tasted bland. They didn't give me enough peanut sauce to blend with all the rice, to which I wonder if it's possible to ask for more than 1 type of sauces. The 5-spice beef was also kinda bland as well, totally did not tasted any of the spices. I think my favourite part was the sweet potatoes.   I also got the Passion Fruit Lychee Soda with my meal and it pretty much tasted nothing like passion fruit nor lychee. Disappointing for sure. After the carbonation disappeared from the drink the taste kinda reminded me of a diluted cough syrup. I also tried their Thai Iced Tea before and I would definitely recommend getting that one over this soda."}
{"text":"So I finally decided to try this place after having walked past in so many times and let me just say that I was SO DISAPPOINTED!  I couldn't even eat despite my hunger  The employees are very lovely and professional no complaints there but what really got me was the PORTION SIZE!. you get 1 base ( noodles, rice or salad) 1 meat and 2 veggies.  Basil practically filled the container with my base of noodles and then gave me 1 leveled spoonful ( like we all have in our draw at home!) Of meat which was cut up so small it got lost in the noodles and then the veggies and AGAIN! the veggies were cut up so small! And I got barely a spoonful each.  On top of that all the sauces they had very just too spicy! I couldn't even enjoy the neal for another reason! DEFINITELY never returning there again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed customizing my food at Basil Box.  I ordered the noodles with sweet potatoes, edamames, and lemongrass chicken, drenched in peanut sauce and Penang curry, topped with crushed peanuts, pumpkin seeds, fresh chillies and pickled veggies.  I didn't know I could spilt my noodle and get half of an another item.  I probably would have tried the brown rice or salad.  Nonetheless, my meal was delicious.  I really enjoyed the sauce the most because it made my meal flavourful.  The fresh chilli also gave it a nice spice.    The Thai iced tea was refreshing.  The only problem with the ice tea was that it was filled all the way to the top so when I poked my straw in, the drink spilt, but hey, that's not a big issue.  Both the box and ice tea tasted delicious and healthy that I'll come back again.  Since it's also gluten-free, I'll bring my gluten-free friend to try it too!"}
{"text":"Anytime I'm at Square One it's like I'm drawn to this place. I've been here multiple times and have tried many different varieties of base and proteins and they are all hearty and delicious.  On this visit I started off with the chilled noodles base and added sweet potatoes and green beans. For the protein, I chose half lemongrass chicken and half 5 spice steak. I went with the penang curry sauce which is really hot (the friendly staff warn you before proceeding) and topped it off with a little bit of everything such as peanuts, Thai red chilies, picked radishes. I ended up with a spicy explosion of flavours with every bite that left me full and satisfied. I added their pineapple rose handcrafted soda to go with my box, probably my favourite amongst all the available choices.   Although I do feel that they could add just a bit more protein in their servings, I can't wait to return in order to try another customized box."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today.  It was very busy, however, they were able to get us out the door with our food in less than 10 minutes.  The portion size was very generous and there are enough options for lots of combinations.  They also Vegan and Gluten Free options.  Very Tasty overall.  I  will definitely be bak"}
{"text":"Think of Chipotle Mexican Grill bowl but with an a southeastern Asian twist to it. Inspired by Thai and Vietnamese cuisine this place is awesome for a quick simple and healthy meal. The staff are super friendly and make great recommendations for first timers. Theres also a variety of sauces to spice things up and you can ask for extra meat or vegetables (at a reasonable cost).  **their spicy sauce is no joke Cash credit or debit is accepted. Would I go back? 100% hands down yes  Ordered a brown rice box topped with extra peppers, corn and 5 spice beef with extra meat and their spicy sauce."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. I had the brown rice with tofu and Penang curry sauce. I was warned it would be really spicy but I didn't taste any spice. Everything was just kind of bland. Perhaps adding more sauce would help. This is a decent place for lunch if you're in the area however I wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Since the Tea Shop 168 near Yonge & Gerrard was permanently closed, I was on the lookout for a new place in downtown where I could grab a bite and work on my laptop. My new \"secret hideout\" needs to meet these criteria: free Wi-Fi, comfortable seating, reasonably low noise level, and decent food and drink options. I'm happy to announce that Basil Box perfectly filled that void.  I was greeted with so much enthusiasm, it was heart warming. Since it was my first visit, I was given a brief \"how to\" on how their menu works. I ended up getting the five-spice steak on a bed of rice noodles and a plethora of awesome toppings. The food tasted fresh and the portion was perfect. I can definitely see myself becoming a regular customer."}
{"text":"Great food. All gluten free. Kim was very helpful in explaining the process as we were first timers.  Food was fresh and had great flavours!"}
{"text":"Inspired by the good reviews, I went here today for lunch. I got a bowl of chilly, soggy rice noodles with an ungenerous topping of tofu, sauteed peppers, and roasted cubed sweet potato, a tiny thimble's worth of bland peanut sauce, and a scandalously parsimonious scattering of fresh herbs, seeds, pickles, etc. I like the build-your-own box/bowl system, and the ingredients have good potential, but it doesn't work if the dish you receive is 98% plain noodles and 2% toppings. It had no flavor at all. After I scrounged around to eat all of the meagre topping, I downed some very plain noodles, and I still felt hungry. With a small bottle of designer water (the only water on offer), my bill came to over $14. A waste. This was my first and last visit. (Also, why are no proper green vegetables offered--e.g., bok choi, spinach, broccoli, kale? Edamame and green bell peppers don't really count as \"greens,\" and it's a bit weird to put starchy vegetables like corn and sweet potato atop starchy rice and noodles....)"}
{"text":"I love that all options are gluten free and fresh. If you can only eat gluten free the last thing you need to worry about is cross contamination. The service is excellent as staff will explain all of the options to you and are fast and efficient. I have only ever had rice bowels with tofu as the protein and its always delicious."}
{"text":"Basil Box is a beautiful, roomy vegan-friendly fast food restaurant with serious chipotle vibes for their boxes. The chefs are very friendly and helpful, so don't feel too overwhelmed if it's your first time there.   You get to pick everything that you want in your box, and if you order drinks they make it pretty fast as well. Normally Basil Box isn't that crowded either, so you can enjoy your meal peacefully.   I ordered lemongrass chicken with short-grain brown rice, all the vegetables (corn, peppers, edamame and sweet potato), toppings (veggie, shallots, sesame seeds, herbs, peanuts, and pumpkin seeds) with classic peanut sauce. I'm not a fan of the chicken or the peanut sauce- I find that the taste isn't very strong. As well, the brown rice was very 'meh' in taste. I'm willing to give Basil Box another try, however, because I do like the concept of the restaurant.  Favorites: THE DRINKS! I LOVE the Thai Iced Tea- I've actually travelled to Basil Box just to pick one up because it's so delicious. It's black tea with condensed milk and made with cane sugar- a bit on the sweet side."}
{"text":"Food is good. But they give you too little for the price. The basil box should be bigger because your paying over $10 for it."}
{"text":"This was standard cafeteria food. I ordered the basil box with mixed greens, sweet potato, corn and tofu, topped with a curry sauce. This curry sauce was the best thing of the box, spicy and creamy, just what I like. However, everything else was pretty meh. The tofu definitely tasted like it had been left out for a couple of hours.  However, the staff were amazing! Friendly beyond belief.  Also, Thai iced tea anyone? Always say yes."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and keep meaning to write a review of this awesome take out place that's become my favourite place in the Square One food court!   You can customize your meal in different ways since they have several choices for types of rice, different proteins, 4 sauces and numerous toppings! My favourite combination here is the brown rice, sweet potatoes, peppers, lemongrass chicken, peanut sauce with sesame seeds, cilantro and shallots. So delicious and filling! Everything tastes fresh and definitely one of the healthier food options in the food court.  The portion you get for about $10 is good for two lunches if you're somewhat of a lighter eater like me but one big hearty lunch if you eat more like my husband.  They also have several drinks to choose from but I have yet to try them because I'm always so full from the food here!  The staff are always helpful and friendly here. Just ask if you want to try any items if they haven't already beat you to it.   Highly recommend this awesome take out place and their success is so well deserved!"}
{"text":"Order from Uber Eats. 5 Spice Steak with Panang Curry. Not only were my wife and I's orders mixed up and prepared wrong, the food somehow found a way to be overly spicy and bland at the same time. I had high hopes and was disappointed. We won't order again."}
{"text":"Incredible food and very friendly staff. I order the lemon Grass Chicken and fell in luv with this new store. The staff was very accommodating and friendly"}
{"text":"The lemongrass chicken was good and seasoned well. The veggies were crisp and tasted fresh. Topped off with sesame seeds, pickled veggies and pumpkin seeds. Fresh and healthy lunch - decent portions - quick and friendly service. The Thai iced tea is amazing!! There's a special summer deal on the Thai iced tea at the moment!! Last time I came by for lunch, I believe the Thai iced tea is regularly priced at $3.75.  Definitely check the place out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Best thai iced tea in town.  Staff is super nice and helpful.  I will definitely recommend this place to everyone.  Please keep the Thai iced tea it is soo good, it will sadden me if the Thai iced tea was taken off the menu.  The freshness and service of this place reminds me that of mandarin."}
{"text":"Super delicious and so worth it, you get a huge box of food for only $10, and also all the ingredients were incredibly fresh and authentic too! The chillies though are super hot so tread carefully! Definitely will be coming back here."}
{"text":"The dining area is very clean and well kept. The food was pretty good. The portions are generous and the food itself is well seasoned and flavorful.   I would explain it as what happens when you combine Chipotle with Asian food. The staff was very quick and efficient. Definitely recommend if you're looking for something quick and easy. There's so many ways to customize your food so there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"Great option for fast food! I've been to Basil Box a few times now; I always get the rice noodles, edemame, corn, tofu, and all the toppings (with extra pickled veggies!). I've had both the tamarind and the sweet chili sauce, but I'm itching to try the panang curry... I just usually go when I'm hungover, and I don't want to irritate my poor stomach with the spice. I like things saucy, so I ask for extra sauce. The resulting bowl is reasonably flavourful and doesn't feel too heavy. I also love the sodas! I've tried both the mango ginger ale and the passion fruit lychee.   The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. The space is awesome, I can't help but be sad it opened the year after I graduated from Ryerson... I know it would have been a hangout spot for me!   Really the only thing I can complain about is it is a little pricey, not necessarily for the quality of food because I think it's pretty fair, but don't come in if you're looking for a cheap bite. But, for a quick, yummy, not-too-heavy meal, it's great!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick meal. Very customizable. Friendly staff that took initiative to explain the ordering process clearly. All in all quite awesome!"}
{"text":"Over time the prices have really jumped here at Basil Box. Especially since the minimum wage increase. The appeal of this place at first was a good, tasty, healthy, fast meal for under 10 dollars but those times under 10 dollars are now long gone. The last time I went in it was up to $11.45. The price point is getting closer towards the point where I might just rather eat lunch elsewhere for 12-15 dollars and get a made to order meal. So it's no longer a five star place for me, but still has some nice things going for it. And I've never had a bad meal here"}
{"text":"It's clean, neat and healthy. But none of this takes away the flavor. They got their options so you can create the box that you like...but once you find the one, that's the one you want every time."}
{"text":"Becoming our fav spot for lunch .  Watch the dressing.  Just the one flame Chilli Lime dressing was quite spicy.   It's fast and very casual with take out."}
{"text":"I liked the concept of this food stall - whatever you call those units in the food court - located at Food Central in #SquareOne!  It was easy to follow and the people who worked there did a good job at explaining everything I needed to know.  To be honest, there really wasn't much to it:  You select a carb + protein (price is dependent on this) + and additional toppings, including various sauces to make your own rice/noodle bowl!  Lemongrass Chicken protein was just over $10, including taxes.  I found it fairly healthy and satisfying.  Great alternative to Whole Foods salad bar &/or Chipotle bowls.  Warning:  Red Thai chillis were deadly and they'll just be scooped in the box freely, so be AWARE.  Definitely a topping to skip if you don't enjoy the heat."}
{"text":"Great concept, I love the fact that you can build your own box and have varieties every time! Been a fan for over a year, but unfortunately I knocked off a star because the amount of toppings they give you have really decreased since the first time I visited.   I usually go for a brown rice base with roasted sweet potato, peppers, five spice steak, and a mix of tamarind and peanut sauces. Very tasty and flavourful, they also have a lot of different crispy topping to choose from (crushed peanuts, crispy shallots, spicy pumpkin seeds, etc.)   I always get the lychee soda, but I feel like the price point is too high for a location that is catering to university students (primarily). The box + drink costs around $16-$17, which is considerably higher than Salad King across the street (who has more choices and larger portions).  Overall, a good place to visit once in a while if you're craving quick and relatively healthy thai food."}
{"text":"Healthy, quick, and many great options at the prime spot beside Eatons. You can choose what you want in your bowl (toppings, carbs, protein, etc.)  If you want something light and affordable, I definitely recommend this place. Service was great, had the hardest time to decide but they told me to take my time.  The inside of Basil Box is spacious and bright, definitely a good spot to hang out with friends too. you will see a decent amount of ryerson students here!  Must try their mango rice pudding that they keep in the fridge beside the main cash area!!! It's so delicious!! Love it. Can't wait to be back during lunch time for a quick grab and go."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite fast food restaurant! The food is always fresh and service has always been great at every location! I can't wait until they open even more locations. I tell everyone about this place"}
{"text":"Delicious. First time eating Basil Box and I loved it.  It's tough to find a healthy choice at the food court that offers vegan options!  While putting my box together, I had trouble deciding on a sauce. The server kindly made a recommendation of mixing the peanut and chilli sauce together, and then offered me a sample.   I enjoyed my brown rice and curry tofu box, it tasted great and was very filling. I meant to snap a pic but I gobbled it up. Not to worry, I'll return one day.   It seems to me if you're going to drop around $10 for a food court meal anyways, let it be here and get good value for your money."}
{"text":"I thought I was going to hate Basil Box because of what I thought it was. Turns out it was exactly the opposite and I absolutely loved the food.   It's conveniently located along the very busy intersection of Queen and Spadina. They seem more of a lunch place but I actually had dinner here on a Friday night with some friends.   There is one washroom. Clean and nice seats with no music. It's a newly opened locations so it has that new feel to it still. I loved the bold bright Pink of the restaurant. The food photography adds depth to the restaurant...afterall you eat with your eyes first.   Their menu is electronically displayed with the selections of base, two vegetables, one protein, toppings and sauces. Then there is the drinks selection. I didn't particularly like that there is no suggestion in terms of paying first or ordering first. So what ends of happening is there is a long line blocking access to the washroom and it's in the middle of the seating area.   The cashier was very friendly with my order in explaining my choices and combinations. This is a BYOB type of deal as in build your own box. They use a non traditional type of container which is not styrofoam based with a clear lid. Napkins and the sort are to the side counter.   I ended up being so bloody full for $15 that evening because it was so much food. They have a combo deal with a $1 off the drinks if bought with a box. I was so impressed with their pineapple and rose water soda. It was delicious. Regular piece is $3.45. More rose water thank pineapple which was a good combination. Very refreshing to have on a hot day.   I first had short grain brown rice followed by roasted sweet potatoes which were cubes and so cute to look at. I also had edamame. I went with the lemongrass  chicken which was so unbelievably flavourful. I loved that there were charred marks. It was about one cup. I had all the toppings which consisted of onions, hot peppers (holy moly those were hot), cilantro, carrots and radish which were shredded nicely and the likes. I opted for a peanut based sauce. It was not the best and I didn't particularly like the   Overall, these bold great Asian flavours won me over. I would definitely go here again. I loved what I ordered and I was so damn full at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Loved this. I was cold and I was hungry and trying not feel overtly guilty about my lunch habits and gave Basil Box a try. Ordered the brown sticky rice, lemongrass chicken, sweet potatoes and Edamame, and had them blend the classic peanut sauce with the Thai chilli lime. Top it off with cilantro. It was all delicious. Glad I made the choice, I'm super full, and will definitely be back and try the cold rice noodles.  Yay!"}
{"text":"A new option to try in the Yonge and Dundas area.  Somewhat a fast food style, you choose your base (noodles or rice) and then meat, sauce and toppings. The format is similar to Chipotle.  I opted for their chilled noodles, lemongrass chicken, roasted sweet potatoes, corn topped with their sweet chili like sauce. This came out to be about $10 which wasn't bad.  Overall everything was flavorful and tasted pretty good. I'm not great with spice and by the mid point, my sauce was a bit spicy (It was rated 1/3 Chilies - yes I'm weak). The portion size for lunch was just about right for me.  The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. As it was our first time, they fully explained their menu and provided suggestions. The look and feel of the restaurant was also very modern.  I would probably come back but it wouldn't be a first choice. Worth a try and this place will probably attract a lot of students looking for a quick meal since its so close to the Ryerson vicinity."}
{"text":"Delicious! I love how there was a great selection of food. The chicken was tasty and the veggie toppings were fresh. We also tried the Thai iced tea (a bit too sweet) and the mango ginger ale soda. Both drinks are worth the try!  The restaurant is surprisingly big and it's also very clean. Staff were very welcoming and knowledgeable. They were very generous with the amount of food portions! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Service: friendly and average, sometimes slow, sometimes fast depending on the time of the day and how many people are working, but it's one of my FAVOURITE to-go lunch spots. It's fast, cheap, great portion, great options, and on the healthier side of \"fast food\" places.  Food: I always get their white rice or rice/salad base, shrimp or tofu, and switch around on the veggies and sauces. I'd say everything taste pretty consistent and great every time I go, and you can always ask for a little bit more on the sauce and toppings if you love your food saucy and messy lol.  Overall: blame my Asian palette, I'd choose my fast food from here over McDonald's across the corner anyday!"}
{"text":"Basil box is definitely one of the healthier asian food take away options in the city and its sooo tasty!  You build your own stir fry so you know exactly what's going into your meal. I ordered brown rice for the base, sweet potatoes and bell peppers as the vegetables, half shrimp and chicken for protein, poured over the Penang curry sauce (which might i add, is HOT HOT HOT), and finished it off with countless toppings. The flavours and large portion size is definitely worth more than the $9.95 price tag.   The only thing I didn't really like was that the rice was a bit dry, but overall, it's definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"I love basil box. My fave place to visit when I'm eating at the mall. Everything is gluten free. Everything!  You get to choose a base carb (jasmine rice, brown rice or cold rice noodles), 2 proteins (shrimp, chicken, beef, tofu), 2 veggies (sweet potatoes, edamame ... can't remember the rest) and then you can add unlimited toppings such as spicy pumpkin seeds, and sauce. I like to mix the sauces. It's a bit pricey at $12, but it usually does me for two meals and tastes amazing even reheated the next day. Just thinking about it is making me hungry.  They are also vegan friendly with certain items."}
{"text":"I wasnt expecting such a good healthy food. I had brown rice, bell pepper, sweet potato, mild sauce made with coconut milk, and shrimp. It was soooooo good and price is awesome for the quality that youre getting."}
{"text":"Today I tried the Thai Iced Tea, which isn't too bad. I don't know if it's traditional to have thai iced tea sweet, but it would be nice to have a \"less/more sweet\" option.. and perhaps a milk vs. cream option, if it doesn't interfere with the drink's recipe :)"}
{"text":"Great quality, been ordering them for a while on Uber eats and everytime it's great. It's fresh, tasty and the box is big."}
{"text":"The staff is always so welcoming and friendly, and for that reason alone I'm happy to go back time and time again.  Like others have said before me, this is a build-your-own-bowl type of restaurant. You choose your base, veggies, protein, sauce, and toppings. It's not the most flavourful place if you are looking spice up your meal, but it's very a very healthy alternative.  My favourite combination is: - white rice - peppers and sweet potatoes - chicken - peanut sauce - all toppings except for cilantro (nothing wrong with their cilantro, I just don't really like it myself)  I always take their Thai iced tea with my meal. Very nice if you have a sweet tooth, but otherwise it may be too sweet for your liking, in that case I think you can ask them to tone down on the cane sugar and condensed milk.  A bit on the expensive side, considering it's not a big bowl, and that they don't give you a lot of veggies and meat. I always have to ask for extra sauce too. My order (bowl + drink) is roughly $13. They make it a meal and take off $1 if you order their drink along with your bowl.  And for some reason I never saw their spring rolls or the mango rice pudding dessert. Maybe it's only a dinner thing and not available during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Basil Box is a great choice for lunch or dinner as it provides the optionality to be healthy if you choose.   You can select from several proteins including steak, chicken, shrimp, or tofu as well as the base which includes a spring mix as the healthiest option to rice noodles, brown rice or the ever so delicious but relatively unhealthier white rice.  My favourite is the shrimp which are cooked well and not chewy at all, paired with the rice noodles.  Basil Box also allows you to add in some veggies like sweet potato and corn. You can also top the box with options like pumpkin seeds, pickled veggies, or sesame seeds.  The storefront has some bar seats as well as regular tables. It's a great place for a quick meal that's both satisfying and healthy."}
{"text":"I LOVE BASIL BOX is an understatement.  Tried the Five Spice Steak with mix of classic peanut & sweet chilli sauce; and it tasted fantastic. And I probably drink their Thai Iced Tea - 3x a week or basically EVERY SINGLE TIME I go to Square one.  Staffs are really accommodating, friendly, and so full of life. So much positivism. I love it!!! Food is flavourful! A box with their signature drink costs $14 (with tax) & its reasonable.    I just wish there will be stamp cards for drinks or food itself. (Like when you buy 5, You get the 6th for free) --just to give back to their loyal customers (like me lol)   But then, regardless, with promos or without.. I still love Basil Box!!"}
{"text":"Basil Box is great, and I'm really pleased they are opening so many locations.   The food is fresh, tasty, flavourful, and quite filling.   Their menu is a select your own type of style so you can choose the base, veggies, protein, and toppings.   Most recently I got the chilled noodles with peppers, sweet potato, lime shrimp, and with cilantro, peanuts, peanut sauce and a bit of spicy Penang curry. It was absolutely delicious!! So filling and great flavours.   It came to about $12 with tax which is perfect for lunch.   This spot is bright and spacious and has plenty of comfortable seating.   What really made this a five star experience was the service. The server was incredibly friendly and took the time to welcome me, and offered suggestions. He even said bye on my way out.   I'll definitely be back to Basil Box soon!"}
{"text":"Mmm basil box...so good, so filling, so....healthy? (Well it can be depending on what you get).   Immediately upon walking in you see the take-out style kitchen where veggies and meats are being prepared in the back and a plethora of cooked foods are ready for you to choose. The restaurant ambience is great - very contemporary and clean.   You start with your base with choices like salad, rice (jasmine or brown), or noodles. Then you choose your veggies (choose 2), protein (tofu, chicken, or beef), sauce (varying levels of spice), and finally toppings (like crushed peanuts, shallots, peppercorn etc).   Opted for a noodle tofu bowl with Penang curry (the spiciest sauce which in my opinion wasn't too bad - though I did need to buy a water). It was so delicious. And very generous serving sizes.   I was amazed at how fresh and healthy the food was. Despite being filling it felt light and easy on the stomach. And I love the options for vegetarians!   I suppose it's more on the pricey side for a lunch spot, but you may have leftovers for dinner/lunch the next day.   I'll definitely be back though just maybe not as often as I'd like. Still deserves 5 stars imo."}
{"text":"Have just visited Basil Box at square one and I am so impressed. Not only by the food, but by the fabulous service. Jeffrey was more than happy to answer any question I had, made suggestions and genuinely wished me a good day. Having worked in service before, I can tell when someone honestly enjoys their job.   The food was yummy! Simple and delicious. And well priced for what you get. I will return many times to this location."}
{"text":"If you're looking for healthy and affordable food in the heart of the city I highly recommend basil box. Basil box is a place where you can customize your food in a bowl with several different toppings. It's very similar to Freshii.   Food- I ordered a brown rice bowl with lemon chicken(yum!). I also added edamame and forgot the other vegetable (lol). Toppings I put the recommended carrots and radish, a little bit of hot, and added the peanut sauce and a little bit of the Siracha pumpkin seeds. Overall amazing! Was very full (even took out leftovers!). The flavours blended well with each other. Only tip- if you like your food with a little bit more sauce (soooo good) ask for extra sauce in a separate container for no extra charge!   Price- around $10 mark.   Verdict- if you want clean eats in the middle of the city, you gotta eat here :)"}
{"text":"This is a flashy new restaurant in the Yonge/Dundas corridor.    We checked it out for dinner on a Friday night.  We got take out but it was extremely spacious with lots of seating.  Totally agree with previous reviews that mention Basil Box is the Asian version of Chipotle.  For my bowl, I started with the chilled rice noodles, added the beans and corn.  For my protein, I selected the shrimps ($9.75) and the tamarind sauce.  Loved the toppings bar - I added a bit of everything but the chilli peppers.  Service was very helpful and friendly.  Got the mango ginger ale ($3.25) as well.  My friend got the Thai Ice Tea and that was definitely way better than the ginger ale.  I'd go back for the ice tea alone!  The bowl itself was just okay...my rice noodles were a bit hard and stuck together.  I ended up just picking through and eating the shrimps and veggies.   Not sure if I'd return, I really wasn't happy about the stuck together, starchy noodles and at $14 for the main and drink, I think it's a bit on the higher end of Asian take out.  You could go next door to Ginger and get almost 2 entrees for that price."}
{"text":"Think Chipotle but with Thai food. You get your choice of rice, two vegetables, one sauce, one protein, and unlimited choice of garnishes. Just slightly more expensive than a burrito bowl at Chipotle and portion size is a bit smaller. I think Salad King across the street is a better option if you are looking for Thai food."}
{"text":"I go between 4 to 3.5 stars... regardless of that, it's definitely a step up from any mall options I've had in a while.  Their service is really sweet and a clear 4 stars.   Mall food courts are not known for their quality or flavour but somehow Basil box tends to avoid those trappings.  With sauces that are not cloyingly sweet or fake, they give your choice a perk up and thinking \"hey, food court food can actually taste real!\".  As for the atmosphere, it's a mall food court ... it is one of the nicer ones as it's quite open with tons of seating choices.  They do have a lot of people taking care of the area so its quite clean.    Service here is what made the whole interaction pleasant.  The ladies helping serve us were really sweet.  They were patient and offering thoughts on what was viewed as the most popular.  Ordering here is quite easy... they break it down to 4 steps.  Pick your base, toppings, proteins, and any extras/sauce.  The variety is nice as you dont feel pigeoned holed to only getting noodle or jasmine rice... you also have brown rice and leafy greens.  I do like how they offer a vegetarian and also GF option for those who have a different dietary requirement.  One thing that was a bit of a draw back is only getting 2 options for the vegetables. Compared to most places, it's at least 3 if not 4.  2 seemed quite limiting ... especially if you're choosing the vegetarian options to start.  Sweet chilli tofu leaf green box - I found this to be closer to the ones you get at King and Bay.  The prices are similar enough too... I guess it's true that you do get what you pay for.  The sweet chilli actually has some heat to it.  It's not going to kill your taste buds but it definitely kicks it around.  There was a decent amount of food but nothing where you see meal sized salads at sit down restaurants.  I wish I did get more options for vegetables but for the 2 I was allowed, it was ok.   Nothing was outstanding by itself but it was fresh, prepared well, and came together with some flavours that lean towards Thai cuisine.  3.5/5  If I'm ever stuck in Square One, I wouldnt hesitate to come back as this spot does bring a nice change to the deep fried or meat heavy options nearby.  It's a bit on the lighter side but at least it's fairly tasty."}
{"text":"Nice place. We went for two bowls and they were good - nothing amazing but still good in overall flavors and heat.   The first combination tried was - Chilled Rice Noodles with Charred Sweet Potatoes, Roasted Edamame, Coconut Curry Tofu, Penang Curry, some Herbs, and Shallots. It was good. The heat from Penang Curry was good. The bowl was followed by a dessert of Sweet Mango Rice Parfait which I didn't like much. The rice didn't seem to be right for the pudding (or the one we are used to).   The second combination tried was - Chilled Rice Noodles with Charred Sweet Potatoes, Lemongrass Corn, Coconut Curry Tofu, Sweet Chilli Lime, Fresh Thai Chilli and Crushed Peanuts. This one was good too. The Tofu was great in both the bowls. The second bowl was complemented with a drink of Good Drink Green Tea which was great.   I would have loved to try the rice but unfortunately, the owner ran out of rice at that time and only had the chilled rice noodles.   Overall, a very nice place in the university area to have a good hearty food."}
{"text":"I freaking love it here! The best part is being able to create/customize to how you want it! Food is just absolutely delicious! It gets better....you can even choose more than one sauce for your food! The people who work there are super friendly and very enthusiastic. Super quick and easy to order, they basically just assemble your food in front of you, no cooking necessary because everything is already precooked.  Love that it is also a healthier alternative to the rest of the vendors in the food court.  If you're a member at Goodlife fitness in Square One, and would like to eat something healthy but don't really have the time to make food, I would definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I have grown up eating a lot of these flavours so I might be slightly biased. This is definitely inspired dishes and not the authentic, but with that being said I love the concept that you can make your own tasting box.   Everything does taste very fresh, crisp and flavourful with the right amount of brightness, tang, and spice as you would desire.   Depending on the server....prepper? you get, they may or may not be too heavy handed on the sauce. But I suppose this is an issue that can occur anywhere, like at Subway sandwiches when you ask for some mayo and then your sub is suddenly drowning in mayo.  Anyways, the food is good and fresh, and I feel is a healthier choice compared to a lot of what is currently out there. And a tastier choice compared to a lot of the healthier options out there.   However, my only complaint is that the food is pretty overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"I love all of their food that I had created myself.I chose green salad, next all of the second choices , lemongrass chicken paneng curry and coriander carrot and chilli. It's the best food for me that I ever have in Toronto. I love spicy food and it made me a little bit cry.Their services are fabulous. They are police kind and always smile. You can ask them for free water.The price is valuable as well; I paid only 10.70$. The food is so fresh. I definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just tried for the first time. Food is quite good, but agree that $16.27 is far too expensive for a QSR. I ate in and I'm glad I did bc I had to ask for more sauce to soak up the noodles, otherwise it would have been pretty dry. Noodles on the mushy side."}
{"text":"It would be unfair for me to leave my last review because Peter, the owner, personally came to apologize and do some damage control with the petty complaint I had.   Peter is a down to earth and approachable guy. He listened to my concern and addressed it. His phone is attached to his hip as he gets notifications of new reviews on Yelp and is quick to respond to his customers. That's testament to the level of commitment and passion he has for his fast-casual restaurant.  Peter, you've done me over and I'll be back for another tasty meal."}
{"text":"September 25th, disappointed with the portion.  I order the same thing: half chilled noodles + half greens, lemongrass corn and edamame, half Tofu + half shrimp and then all toppings except cilantro and the other green with Penang curry and peanut sauce.    Food was tasty but the portion was significantly less (see picture)."}
{"text":"Healthy options and the people who work there are very nice. Perfect spot for studying, there is a lot of space for seating! I thought that my bowl wasn't going to fill me up but it definitely did in the end."}
{"text":"A regular spot for me. Mostly delivered, but a few dine in experiences as well. The food is always fresh, fragrant, and delicious. Service is always friendly. Good value for portion and freedom to customize meals! My regular box: tofu with brown rice and spring mix, doused in the peanut sauce. Yummmm!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Basil Box and I can firmly state that there will be plentiful more time that I will be visiting! I love the overall airy feeling and atmosphere of the restaurant (lots of natural light seeping in) and it's conveniently located right underneath the Student Learning Centre, where I normally go to study.   I really like how friendly and nice the staff were, everyone greeted me with a great big smile. I love how the rice and noodles were gluten free.   So I was feeling noodles that day, for the base I ordered the chilled rice noodles, charred sweet potatoes + roasted green beans for my veggies (and goodness they were so delicious), coconut curry tofu as my protein, penang curry as the sauce (not as spicy as expected/stated) and garnished with pickled veggies and roasted sesame seeds. I devoured the entire bowl.   I also ordered a Thai Iced tea, which also tasted delicious. Food items were relatively fair in comparison to other neighbouring Thai Restaurants. 10/10 will go here to eat again."}
{"text":"Graben 2 drinks here in this hot afternoon. Thai iced tea and passion fruit lychee soda. I don't like Thai tea, maybe too sweet for me. But it's a lovely place to relax. Love their bag hanger, very sweet"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a healthy hearty meal, Basil Box is the place to be. I always leave so full in a good way. The idea is a build your own bowl style restaurant, similar to a Chipotle. So you start off with noodles or rice, then you choose your veggies (the sweet potato is incredible, try it) then on to your protein (beef, chicken, shrimp or tofu)-I've tried the chicken and the tofu, both super flavorful. Next you pick a sauce, I always go with the tamarind because I can't get enough tamarind and its a delicious sauce. They also have spicy sauces for those who enjoy spicy options. Then your pick some toppings-the pickled veggies are a must, the flavor is just perfect. Then it comes to around $10 so you're so pleased with the amount of food you just got. The bowls are pretty big! They also make sodas here which are really good! I've tried the mango ginger ale and it was pretty great.  Basil Box is a great place to stop if you're in a rush and want to grab something really quick, but it's also a great option if you want to grab food and hang out at the location. All around this is a great place!"}
{"text":"A great option for better-for-you food court food!  The employees are very attentive and were able to answer all of my questions. They were willing to let me try multiple sauces and even offered to combine two of them!  The sauce flavours can be a hit or miss. If you like spicy/flavour packed food I suggest adding sriracha and the chillies. I had to come back and ask for more sauce halfway through the the bowl because the bottom was pretty dry, which they were happy to give me for free :)  The bowl is big enough for a meal + a snack for later on!  I would definitely recommend Basil Box if you're looking for a place to eat at Square One that doesn't pack on the calories"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I like the options - the choices. The quick service. The good feeling I get after lunch thinking I ate something that felt healthy. Often times, this is my cheat meal.  I typically opt for the tofu, shrimp and chicken bowls. I have been satisfied every time - good portions, that keep you full throughout the day. This spot is the reason I end up going for lunch more often that I intend to. I might also be bias since it''s so close to my workplace. Funny enough I prefer to walk here than bother checking out the Eaton centre food court which is connected to my office."}
{"text":"This is the second Basil Box location and it's soo gorgeous! The food is non-dairy and gluten free, so it's perfect for me. If you are used to lighter meals, definitely do half greens, you'll thank me later. You can also mix the sauces- I did half peanut sauce / half tamarind. The Thai tea and lime ginger macarons are full of fresh flavours, I could eat 10+ in one sitting. The cold brew coffee hit me pretty hard, I'm usually so used to caffeine that it has no effect on me but I was pleasantly surprised. This location is central Toronto - right by the Eaton centre and Ryerson, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"We have been following Basil Box on Instagram waiting for it to open. There are really interesting options to add together to make up your box, we chose rice noodles + corn + sweet potatoes + cilantro + basil + lemongrass chicken + pine nuts + peanuts + peanut sauce and it was delicious! Such a unique combination. We tried the trail mix as well and had to buy a bag to take home, the seasonings were really good. If you want to try something different in a food court setting we suggest trying the Basil Box at Square One!"}
{"text":"The perfect not too healthy, healthy fast food. You can customize your meal to be more carb-heavy or less, meaty or vegetarian or vegan, spicy or sweet or both, and there's a decent amount of yummy (free) extra toppings too. Gimme them pickled veg all day long, yummm.   I've fallen into a pattern here: half brown rice half greens, tofu, corn and sweet potato, half spicy peanut half tamarind sauce, pickled veg (again: yum), and all the extra free toppings - including the Thai chilis (very spicy but oh so good) but excluding the cilantro (aka the devil). Its delicious and has never failed me. But I encourage exploration because its alllll good.   So check it out next time you're in the area. Do takeout or grab a seat (if you can find one) and scarf that goodness till its gone...or until you can't fit anymore in your stomach and save the rest for later. As long as you eat the greens (if you opted for them in the first place) everything still tastes great the next day."}
{"text":"Very tasty food but I was still hungry when I left and I'm not a huge eater. For $12.94, I feel like I should have been full by the time I was finished. I think nearby restaurants / quick eats are a better value."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Pricey -- especially given that it's attached to a university -- but fresh and tasty. Nice atmosphere, and neat drink choices."}
{"text":"Viet Thai fusion food?! I'm down! I've been here a few times to grab some dinner before my night classes and all the times I've gotten it, I'm always impressed. Everything is always so fresh and has so much flavour to it. I never change what I order lol, I usually end up getting the same protein and veggies haha.   Chilled noodles + edamame + sweet potato + lemon grass chicken + peanut sauce + curry sauce + a little chilli sauce  Garnishment I add everything except the parsley.   I find the portions is a lot for me. I usually end up having leftovers for be next day to eat. The last time I ordered they had a promo where if you buy a box and a drink you can save a dollar. They had I think 4 drinks. 3/4 were refresher drinks and one of them was a Thai milk tea. I got the Thai milk tea and I really liked it. Apparently it had a weird aftertaste to it and my friends didn't like it but.. idk I didn't taste anything weird LOL. PSA also still sick so maybe my taste buds are still broken hahaha. But anyways I thought the spice of the box might have affected my taste for the milk tea so I had it a while later and it still tasted the same to me. More on the sweet side so next time I would ask for less sugar.   Basil box is on the more pricer side so I don't have it as often. Will be back though!"}
{"text":"My go to place at the square one food court, reasonable price, fast food and polite staff. I usually go rice, double corn, lemon-grass chicken, lime+peanut sauce, herbs. For drinks I would get the Thai iced tea, it is one of the best Thai iced tea you could find in Mississauga, and best in Toronto sides the one from Khao San Road in downtown(that is the name of the restaurant, not an actual street lol). Friendly servers(hard to come by nowadays sadly), Jeffrey the one who served me the last two visits would even offer to let you taste test each sauce before you decide which sauce you want in your box(\"Basil Box\" get it?). No rush no negative energy at all, which is a good mix with their refreshing food and drinks.   The corn is very fresh and juicy, which is why I went double(you can choose two types of veggies per bowl).  The lemon-grass flavor on the chicken is on point. Lime+peanut sauce is very refreshing while creamy and rich in flavor.  Herbs is just icing on the cake here. The Thai iced tea is the best compliment to this meal.   One of the best places to have lunch or dinner if you are in Square One. Would definitely recommend for it's friendly service and tasty food."}
{"text":"I tried this new spot at sq1 this weekend and I must say that the food court definitely need a spot like this. The peanut sauce added on to my dish was really tasty but I think they should add more of it as there was a lot of rice that was dry since there wasn't much sauce. But all in all the flavours were on point. The refresher mango drink was good too."}
{"text":"I am fully aware that this is a fast food restaurant, but I'm not ashamed to say that I'm obsessed with this place. While in town for TIFF, I always stop in here (twice during the last trip, as a matter of fact) for a quick meal to shovel into my face while waiting on line for a movie.   On my most recent visits, I ordered bowls with spring greens as a base, peppers, edamame, sweet potatoes and tofu. I tried 2 different sauces- the classic peanut (excellent) and sweet chili lime, which although it was only 1 flame, nearly set my face on fire. It sure was tasty though! I chose pickled veggies, herbs and sriracha pumpkin seeds as toppings, and those were a really nice touch. The herbs really elevated it to the next level for me.   All of the ingredients (although I can't personally speak for the meats) are high quality and gluten free so unlike most Asian restaurants, I don't have to worry about soy sauce hiding in everything. It's been busy the times that I've stopped in, but the employees are friendly but also efficient, so the line has moved quickly. It's a little bit pricey, but the quality and quantity make it worth it in my opinion. Now who do I have to contact to get a location near me??!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and very clean place. Conveniently located two blocks from eaton centre They are like chipotle style where you choose your base, protein, vegetables etc into a bowl. Approx $9 a box and $4 for drinks. You can order half and half base (noodle and rice). Would recommend if you need a quick spot for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for great Asian food.  I was excited about this prospect and the rave reviews on Yelp.  My friend and I ordered the make your own dish,  one with the rice and one with the noodle.   I started having reservations when all the ingredients are not cooked fresh In front of you,   They were kept in containers ( not sure if they were even kept heated).  Like cafeteria style.  The end result was a Luke warm inedible MESS.  I'm not that hard to please but this was $25 slop.   The manager was not willing to do anything even when she saw that we barely touched our meals.   Go across the street to Salad King or Sukho Thai...run don't walk... Horrendous food.  Truly disappointing.  Re: Peter's response to my review/-/For the record my friend and I decided to cut our losses and eat some of the protein (which there wasn't much to begin with! --but we couldn't even finish that.  There was still a mound of rice and vegetables left on our plate!!  It was only then that we decided to bring the terrible meal to the manager's attention-- we were not trying to get a free meal, we only wanted to have a decent meal! Duh! We didn't even have a meal!  We walked down the street and had to order another at another restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered the sweet potato, corn, and tofu with peanut sauce. It was a good portion and along with the thai iced tea, was a filling and relatively healthy lunch. Good vegetarian option for those who always look for places to go with others who enjoy meat.  I'm not a fan of spice so the panang curry was way too spicy for me. I tried a small spoonful (they always ask if you want to try the sauces) and couldn't handle it already. The panang curry is a popular choice amongst the party I usually go with though.   The environment is also very relaxing and spacious. There is never a shortage of tables (though Im never there at prime times, so I can't speak for that).   Overall, this is a 'go-to' place of mine and i highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have walked by Basil Box many times and finally decided to try the summer rolls.  For 3 dollars plus tax, you receive two very fresh rolls and a tasty dipping sauce.  After I bought it, I went outside to eat it.  As it was very sunny I had on my sunglasses, I didn't notice the very thin saran wrap around the roll and accidentally ate part of it. I've eaten summer rolls from dozens of other places and no one puts plastic wrap, especially when it's already in a plastic container. I'm just thinking if a parent gave their young child this roll and didn't notice that it was wrapped in very thin plastic (which can be mistaken for rice paper), the child could choke."}
{"text":"Yum!  Yum!  Yum!  Friendly and modern meets rustic dining area. Clean and always maintained. No parking around must park on side streets.  The food is so good.  I like to have my food served hot and my combo is:  * BASE - brown rice * VEGGIES - beans and sweet potato  * PROTEIN - lemongrass chicken * SAUCES - penang curry mixed with tangy tamarind * TOPPINGS - all but the fresh chilies  The combo above is spicy with sweet tang. The serving size is large, it's takes me two sittings typically to finish it. You can find other options online. It's easy, quick and friendly. The prices are fair - $10 taxes in!  Drinks are unique - too sweet for me. Tried only the Thai milk tea - yum!  Another neat feature is the food containers are paper based and a take-out bag is paper too.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Who knew the Square One food court could produce a gem like this?   Awesome fresh and healthy concept for mall Asian fusion food. Pick your base of rice, noodles or salad, then 2 veggies, a protein, and toppings. It's all served in a bowl.  I tried the 5 spice beef on rice noodles with roasted green beans and corn. For a sauce I took a weet Thai chili topped with a few Thai peppers.  The flavors and heat were intense and delicious. I've never had mall Asian food like this before. Will make a point to come again and again."}
{"text":"Ok girl I see you. This isn't your average assembly line restaurant. No it kind of is, the only difference is the fact that they have Thai options. This is a good alternative for chipotle, prices and quality of food are very alike. Honestly 5 stars goes out to their bomb aesthetic. Very welcoming and clearly student oriented."}
{"text":"4.5  I'll preface this with saying I am not a fan of \"build your owns\" when it comes to food. Build your own stirfry, burger, salads, pizza.... if it ends up tasting blah, you are left wondering if you should blame yourself or the quality of the parts you put together and therefore the place. Plus, when you are hungry and there are so many choices, it can be annoying.  I went here because of the reviews of this particular location and also because it seemed like a healthier choice.  Lets just say I'll take credit for my salad tasting awesome first then I will give Basil Box credit second haha. I was surprised considering I came in disappointed at the build your own concept and plain looking ingredient choices. BUT no, it was yummy!! Everything that I chose went well together. I was glad I could mix the base of rice noodles and salad greens, then sweet potato and peppers, then lemon grass chicken, tamarin sauce (thank goodness I asked for extra sauce), sesame seeds, onion flakes and of course cilantro. Yummy and hearty.  When its build your own and the line is fast its easy to feel overwhelmed, but the gal behind the counter was so nice as to ask if it was my first time there and if I wanted her to explain how it all works. They are quick but not impatient. Reco'ed to my friends already and I do plan on going back!"}
{"text":"I rarely go to Square One and I usually hate food courts so I popped by this place which looked new. Service was prompt and perky but I found the food to be a bit weak in flavor and seasoning. Everything tastes like it sits in a heating pan. The only vegetarian protein item available was tofu. I tried the Penang Curry sauce which was supposed to be hot but I found it mild but that could be a taste thing. But if you stir everything up and let it sit there for a few minutes things feel a bit more authentic and flavorful. I liked the choice of toppings, which are varied and interesting. Overall a positive experience and one of the few healthy options worth checking in this suburban environment."}
{"text":"I'm really loving the customize your own food experience! The line up during lunchtime is ridiculous, out the door the last time I was there.   I ordered the chicken bowl on brown rice, customized it with sweet potatoes and edamame! Their tamarind sauce is great.   Tip: you can mix the sauces for an even better and bigger flavour!"}
{"text":"A fancier Thai fast food place. Trying to see what is this hype on this new restaurant, technically it is fast food restaurant that has elevated its status by having a nicer setting and a different serving method. What it reminds me of Mexican restaurant like Chipotle... you pick what ingredients you want in your bowl.   Food seems ok and price seems ok for a downtown location."}
{"text":"What to do when insomnia sets in?  Write yelp reviews lol.  So i went to Basil Box a few hours ago after securing coupons for a free drink and meal.  This is a Thai restaurant.  How it works is that you line up to order your food as if you are back in a high school cafeteria.  You are then asked to pick your carb first, so i chose pasta.  Next comes the veggies.  I went for corn and peppers since i was allowed to pick two.  Then protein.  My friends went for shrimps but i opted for steak instead.  The steak was more akin to dices of beef.  2nd last step is to select your sauce.  In this case, they encouraged me to be creative by mixing chilli lime sauce with peanut sauce.  Finally you choose toppings for your dish.  I told them to sprinkle a bit of everything on my pasta. To be honest i was apprehensive about this quirky dish that i created what with 2 different sauces mixed together, but i have to say it wasn't bad.  The steak should really just be called beef.  It was a bit spicy and flavourful.  I liked the nuts and mixes that were thrown into the pasta.  The food was ok.   I also ordered mango ginger ale soda and boy! That was a great refreshing summer drink!  My friends ordered Thai iced tea and all said it was too sweet. And that was my friday night food experience.  That's all folks!"}
{"text":"The ingredients looked staled by the end of the night. The food was all very bland and the dish didn't have enough sauce. Most of the bowl was rice."}
{"text":"They don't like vegetarians after 6PM... last three times I've been here after 6PM they're out of tofu but gladly still serving all meats. Avoid if you don't eat animals."}
{"text":"I feel like it's almost a healthier alternative for Chipotle.   Got the chilled noodle as main. Really liked it."}
{"text":"I had heard through social media about the opening of the Basil Box and couldn't wait to try it out myself!  I was a bit overwhelmed when looking at the menu, but the staff was quick to explain everything! Even when I couldn't decide on the base, they suggested that I do half of each!   Since it was my first time ordering, the staff gave me suggestions on what others had picked before and what they really enjoyed!   I ended up picking the green mix and noodles for the base, with lemongrass chicken, sweet potato, corn, peanut sauce (delicious, btw!), and some random toppings!   They also succeeded in upselling me on my drink (I ended up getting the mango ginger ale...which was a bit too sweet for my taste, but still really good!)  If the service keeps up and the food quality stays the same, this place will be a huge hit! I loved it and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Extremely delicious. I ordered the shrimp one and I find it to be the most delicious protein, would strongly recommend it to other people. I also loooooooove their spicy level!!!!!   Slightly overpriced at the moment I feel."}
{"text":"My favourite \"fast food\" option. Basil box is healthy, fresh and delicious. I love how you can customize your box in many different ways yet it is always a super fast experience with very friendly and organized staff."}
