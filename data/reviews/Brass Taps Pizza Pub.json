{"text":"The food was pretty good.  Great atmosphere and crowd. But the waitress with the dark brown hair was rude and our food waited for her on the counter for 20minutes before givibg it to us so it was very cold. Her attitude was negative.  She rushed out orders and the orange juice is gross."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow despite the place being fairly empty, and I later realized we might have been overcharged for some items but did not get a call back from the staff members who had been on duty despite requesting several times. There was also a problem with one of the dishes, but was fixed pretty quickly, and the sever was overall very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a tough review.  I liked the look/feel of the place.  Very \"me\".  The beer selection was sub-par for a place that is called Brass Taps.  I want you serving micro brews from around the world.  Fosters doesn't count.  I was bummed.  Until... I had some of the food.  Very good.  The pizza was fresh and tasted great.  Sadly, I'd go back for the food and suffer through a pint.  :)"}
{"text":"Brass Taps is Gabby's poor cousin.   If you have been to Gabby's, that's pretty bad."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza (mushroom, green pepper, and pepperoni). Loved it.. actually, one of the best I've had in Toronto. My girlfriend ordered some kind of pasta (italian sausage rigatoni I think) and it was probably the worst pasta I've tasted in Toronto... it tasted.. like... nothing! So, our experience was as hit-or-miss as it gets. :)"}
{"text":"The Brass Taps is a straight up no b.s. \"local\" to grab a pint (or two) and has pretty reasonably priced pub grub. Their pizzas and panzorottis are  tasty and you can build your own or choose from a set list. One nice find was that they also make an above average  burger,  The staff are great, the music playlists is always good and there's a patio out back for those needing to feed the nicotine monkey."}
{"text":"This place has great staff, and is one of my destinations of choice to drink alone on those days my GF is sick of dealing with me.  They have a good selection of local beers, including my new Favorite, Spearhead, which is a bit hard to find these days.  I like that this is a place I can just go and drink, without having to listen to pop music, or feel the need to dress up. the world needs local bars, and this is mine.   the foods not great, but who cares? its on the Danforth, grab a souvlaki."}
{"text":"The pros:  Great location. Pleasant, clean dining/drinking area. Food seems to be prepared quite freshly.  Really good onion rings.  Generous side dish of sour cream for the nachos (I hate those skimpy little pill cups!)  Prices are reasonable.  The cons: Food is very slow to arrive. I'm a bit lenient here, since it's hot and fresh-looking when it arrives, but we waited easily 20 minutes for some wings and nachos.  Service is courteous but also slow to check on you and ask for/bring fresh beverages.  Service was also pretty slipshod.  The server forgot to hold the jalapenos, then didn't say anything when she returned to see that I'd had to pick them off. She disappeared for a long time, leaving us with empty glasses. When she did arrive, she asked if we wanted another beer, then forgot to bring it for another 10 minutes.   We probably will come back because the food's pretty good and well priced.  But certainly not when we're in any kind of hurry."}
{"text":"nice little pub. good drinks, good food for price. friendly."}
{"text":"Brass Taps? Bring a girl? R u kidding me?   I've been to a couple of locations, most recently College St, and it's strictly deep fried run o' the mill fare.  Let's face it, there's lots of places to hang out and have beer, and I wouldn't choose this one:("}
{"text":"This is really simple; Brass taps is a great dive that has a wonderful rotating list of local craft beer and amazing pizza. Everything is handmade and might just be some of the best pizza in Toronto. The price is good, and the atmosphere is very warm and quite wonderful when it's not packed full of people.   I try to go atleast once every time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Dingy and dark.  Not overly inexpensive ($17 a pitcher for Mill Street Organic- next time I guess I'll get Labatt 50).  Cheesy pizza people at the table seemed to like.   Patio if not too busy is where you should head- although it is small, so if it's a busy day it may be tough.   Unless you're into watching TV while you socialize....just go to the Emmet Ray right beside it.  John S. sucks!!"}
{"text":"10 ans, 20 ans ? J'y ai souvent mangé ou pris un verre avec un grand ami au cours des années. Certes la clientèle est parfois un peu rebutante : quelques gugusses à l'esprit étriqué mais le propriétaire des lieux a toujours su nous accueillir avec sympathie et gentillesse. Les pizza sont bonnes mais vaut mieux y passer pour une bonne bière ..."}
{"text":"My next stop of pubs + something (previously pub + Greek) takes me to Brass Taps Pizza Pub on the Danforth.  I was in the mood for pasta. Not the really fancy stuff that's going to run me a lot of dollars and leave me feeling like I should have just made it at home. No, I wanted some basics, but I didn't want East Side Mario's.  This landed me at Brass Taps. Pub, dart boards, pool tables and Italian fare! Hey, why not?  Even better, I walked in on Pasta night, where any pasta plate plus a side Caesar salad plus garlic bread is only $9.95 (as of June 30, 2009). My partner and I ordered the anti-pesto for two, which was a mistake. Now, not because it wasn't good, it was certainly acceptable. The cheesy bread left us wanting regular bread, and the inclusion of a few luncheon meats plus the prosciutto was a little confusing. But, this was just too much food, and by the time our mains came we were full.  I ordered the fettuccine carbonara which had better than expected chicken and the bacon and dried tomatoes didn't overpower the sauce, which was a nice surprise. I say better than expected because most pub chicken is so dry it may as well be jerky. My partner ordered a pizza that came with toppings that were served with the anti-pesto, which wasn't bad, just poor planning on our part.  The space is large, there's a small patio out front and you can come in big groups. Every night there's a different special (Wednesday is half-price pizza night) although the prices are certainly acceptable without a discount.  While the Woodbridge Italians may scoff at the menu, the choices certainly hit the spot. Oh, and they have Kronenberg on tap... which is rather choice!"}
{"text":"I sure wish that God would allow me to give this place a higher rating. Unfortunately the laws of brutal honesty demand that I not be as kind as I wish. The pizza pump is my favourite!   The inside looks like it might be called \"Madigans\" or \"Gladigans\" or \"Magicans\" or something like that. Or if you just mulitplied its size several fold you would eventually generate a TGIFridays or an Appleby's. So...that's kind of a strike against it, despite the fact that it has not, in reality, been so multiplied in size.   It has dueling patios. One front. One back.   The food is better than it needs to be, but not good enough to matter. I favour the pasta primavera---it has broccoli.   Friendly staff, nice mixture of people drinking there most nights.   Vague literary (perhaps Newfoundland literary?) theme which emerges as you approach the rear of the establishment.   There's no point in this review, because it isn't a destination and if you lived nearby you'd have already been here."}
{"text":"I used to live in the area, so I don't think I have enough fingers and toes to count the number of times I've been to Brass Taps. And, even though I've moved what seems like a lightyear away, I went over the weekend and felt at home immediately.  It's great because: 1. They have a great selection of beers. 2. There's unassuming (but friendly) crowd. 3. They will let you sit there forever. 4. They have a super low-key patio. 5. They have a few board games behind the bar, which helps encourage #3. 6. Their pizza is actually really, really decent. 7. You never feel like you should have gotten all-did-up when you're there.  If you live in the area, it's bound to become a staple."}
{"text":"Went to Brass Taps on College. I have been going to both Brass Taps locations for years. Hearing something here also about the blonde waitress and service. Strangely, when bill arrived, she took the total amount in the tray, belted out \"You are good for change?\" Didn't wait for an answer, and said \"Thank you!\"..... Usually about a 15-20% tipper regardless. But found this move odd. Food is always great there. I like the Mexican and Mystic Pizza. Wings are ok too! One of the only decent spots where you can get good pizza, beer and wings in Toronto. Whattup with the blond though?"}
{"text":"Came here a couple of weekends ago. The place itself has a very \"dive bar\" look and feel. Super nice waitress and bar staff. Only had a few drinks and it was really quiet on a Saturday night so that made it easy to talk with friends. But... I got very sick the next day and at first I thought I was just having a very bad hangover, however, I learned a few days ago that everyone who had draft beer (one person only had 1 pint) were ALL very stomach sick so that leads me to believe that they might not clean their tap lines often. I wouldn't normally write a review like this if it were only me who got sick but the fact that everyone did made me feel I should speak up."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer. There were a couple craft beers, but mostly the usual suspects.   Decor looks dated, but cozy. Standard pub decor with wood trim and stained glass. The kitchen was open concept; unusual for a pub.  It would've been better if the server hadn't forgot to get the bill twice. We ended up hanging out there for an extra 15min until when my friend went to go find the server so we could leave."}
{"text":"Nice local bar. Fun to watch a game at. Pretty tasty pizza and I also like their burger and steak sandwich. Good selection of beer. Good service."}
{"text":"What you see is what you get with Brass Taps. A bit of a hole in the wall with some cheap beers on tap. Their food is decent, but I haven't tried their pizza yet. I would recommend their nachos and veggie burger. They have a couple pool tables and pin ball machines at the back. It's a pretty reliable place to grab a drink and watch whatever game is on."}
{"text":"Tonight I don't feel to be narrative. So I'll be reviewing in points: - place: so so, very very unpretentious but, if you don't mind (and I don't), it'll be perfectly fine; - staff: friendly and sufficiently fast; - beers: not many but I'm actually ok with it. Several local breweries and not so many import (yay, love that); - food: I ordered the wings and my gf lasagna. The verdict? The wings, mild and of a good size, were well done. And the Lasagna? Portion wise nothing to complain, actually, quite the opposite. As per the flavour, I gotta say that considering this is a pub, the lasagna was pretty damn good. The only demerit point goes to the tomato sauce: a little too acidic for my taste.   Overall, it's surely a decent place to go. Fair prices for a honourable quality of food! 3.5/5"}
{"text":"*3.5 stars  Less pub, more restaurant, but solid 'za nonetheless.  I'd only popped in here for pints on previous occasions, but I was hungry and lazy last night, so I thought I'd give their pizza a whirl and I'm glad I did.  There are about 25 10\" pizzas to choose from, none of which were really out there (Danforth Pizza and Spaghetti House takes that title) and ranged from $10 to $12 each.  We ordered the a Zorba the Greek and a San Sebastian (I think). The Zorba was loaded with lots of kalamata olives, feta, red onion, oregano and was an 8/10. The San Sebastian had red onion, roasted red pepper, capicolo and oregano and I'd give it a 7.5/10. The crust and sauce on both were pretty tasty too.  Good selection of taps - on the order of 10 - and plenty of bottles to choose from.  Despite the crowd in the bar, our service was very friendly and very efficient.  I'll be returning to graze the rest of the pizza and beer menu soon"}
{"text":"Recently, I enjoyed my first bottle of Erdinger Dunkel, which I received as a Christmas gift several months back.  I'd had several pints of the Weissbier, but hadn't thought much of it.  Anyways, I was delighted to find this incredible dark beer on tap at the Brass Taps, and enjoyed several pints during the hockey game before calling it a night.  The service was tremendous - attentive without being invasive.  I'll definitely be back again soon, and once I've played some on some of the pool tables and tried some of the food on the menu, I'll update this review."}
{"text":"I used to live really close to here and was a regular for a bit. This place has a great, hip but unpretentious atmosphere. The music is always good, the beer is priced decently and they have pretty tasty pizzas ranging from traditional style to gourmet.     It's not just good for pub fare in the evenings but they have a pretty decent, full brunch menu on Saturday and Sunday."}
{"text":"Brass Taps is my favourite restaurant on the Danforth. The food is great, especially if you love pizza and the beer is always perfectly chilly. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I wish I could give less than one star.  The evening started with our server, Brendan, not being able to differentiate between my friend and I, asking if I had just ordered....things just got worse from there.  Drinks and food ensued, and we watched the Raptors lose.  Food was brought out staggered. We all wanted to wait until everyone received their food before starting. This took at least 10 minutes. I got the So-So Cal pizza $13 my man ordered the Play it Safe $12. Mine was spicy, his plain.  I asked for another drink, then re-asked when he brought everyone else's. Brendan said, \"I didn't hear you. You should have made sure I understood that you wanted me to bring you a drink\". My friend (whom he mistook me for) let him know she concurred that she had heard me order a drink. I received my drink. Who knows what was in it.  My friend waited in vain for Brendan to come to our table to take her order, I think she finally went to the bar.  We reserved a table for 7 people including our friend's 5 month old baby which sat in his pram. The server added a 14% gratuity to our bill. We asked him to split our bills, to which he replied, \"there are a lot of people waiting to pay their bills right now, so if you want to wait, I can split it for you.\" Brendan let our table know that we were \"free to add more tip if we wanted.\" My doppelgänger and I had a good laugh at that one. Everyone put in cash and there was $75.72 left over which my man was (to put it mildly) reluctant to pay. I paid and told Brendan that I used to serve all through school, university and after, and that I was stunned by the service we received by him.  He was unapologetic and defended that he had never had any complaints before.  As we left the bar steam was coming out of my ears. I couldn't believe it. I swear I thought Ashton Kutcher was going to jump out and tell us we'd been punked. I don't even know if that show is on anymore. I'm dating myself. I digress...  I fully intended to call the manager(s) to complain about this flake, but the problem is, as I've read in other reviews below, this seems to be the norm at this place. Either they don't care about customer service and/or they have a tight-knit staff of goofs. Either way I wasn't going to get any satisfaction.   Instead I am sharing our lacklustre experience with all y'all so that hopefully you don't fall victim to the sub-par service offered at the Brass Taps Pizza Pub. I could get sophmoric and make a parody of the bar name, but I will resist."}
{"text":"I love the Brass Taps!  The food is decent pub fare, and most of the servers are pretty friendly.  I recommend the side salad over fries with any of the new menu samdwiches or burgers.  I dunno what it is about that salad, but it's fantastic!  Brunch is alright too, but they could give you a bit more hollandaise."}
{"text":"Took my three year old daughter here for dinner. Poor service (had to ask for almost everything twice), was informed that the wings were good, and they were NOT.  They changed the channel on the TV that I was clearly watching without even inquiring if it was okay. Food took forever.  Couldn't even get server attention in order to pay. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I have been here a lot, and they treat me like Norm from Cheers when I walk in the door.  Great beers on tap. Good place to watch a game. Can get busy, but you can usually find a spot.   Food is great pub fare. But the best thing to have is their hot wings. THE best I have had. Good sauce on them and they use really meaty chicken. Make sure you have their usual hot wings, as the ones on special can be a bit bare.  Also great are the sweet potato fries, and pizza.  Great place overall. Not fancy, but who needs fancy 24/7? Right!?"}
{"text":"So far as I'm concerned, the food was top-shelf. The place is a pub, and for pub food, it's definitely above average. I had a pesto-chicken wrap that was absolutely amazing--warm and stuffed with gooey, tasty goodness. Service was spot-on and with a smile.   My visit was on a rainy weekday lunch, so the crowd was nil.  I'd definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"This was stop #5 on the Danforth Social Meetup's 2nd pub crawl.    I always knew there was at least one place where young people went to pick up on the Danforth and this seems like that place.  Some place that is clearly not an old many bar, a place that is harmless enough like a Firkin but still has its own character--yes, this seems to be that place.  Sadly, we didn't stick around for a drink.  It was busy and we would not have been able to sit together.  Or at all.  So, we moved on.  If you are looking for a cool place, and are late 20s-30s, this just might be your place on the 'forth.  I've been told that the pizza is good too.  Staff seemed a bit annoyed and rushed judging by the looks on their faces.  But it does get busy on a Saturday.  Probably not good for a pub crawl but good with a small group."}
{"text":"The reason why this place is getting two stars was because of our service, hands down.  My bf and I were hungry around midnight on Friday, and pizza sounded good. We knew the bar would be open for at least a few more hours so it was a safe bet for a late bite. We decided to order a pizza to share and a basket of onion rings. Onion rings were a little over cooked/dried out, but not shocking since I could see only one guy was working in the open kitchen area and he seemed new...I say this because I saw him put a bowl of something in the oven, spill it, and then go to pick it up with his hands instead of tongs. Pizza - double cheese burger - hit the spot.  Once our server caught wind that we weren't drinking alcohol, she was just gone. Had to ask several times for our waters to be refilled (I had started with fountain coke, but the machine must of been messed up because it was HORRIBLE and about 3 dollars for one glass), when she brought our food we had asked for a side of dip, which also didn't come until we were basically finished our food and had asked repeatedly.  It wasn't even busy, it's not like she had a million other tables. I could see her standing about 15 feet away at the POS talking to another server, a bunch of times she walked right passed our table and looked right at us and never said anything.  When our waters finally came she didn't even take away our empty glasses! Another server that was done her shift (had her purse on and was holding a drink) was nice enough to come and clear some things off of our table. Even after pushing our remaining dishes to the edge of the table, putting our coats on, and trying to catch her attention, it took a good 15 minutes for her to bring the bill.  Here's a tip, stop sucking at life and I'll give you more than 7 cents next time.  Just because people aren't drinking their faces off on a Friday night doesn't mean they won't give you a decent tip. Try slapping a smile on that face of yours and stop acting so hard done by, honestly."}
{"text":"Only thing good here is the summer lobster and pizza. Everything else is shit. Ive gotten food poisoning here not once, but TWICE. The bar staff is super nice though, love them. Great for a pint."}
{"text":"Stopped in few times for afternoon lunches and will undoubtedly be back at some point based on its location and the fact its open earlier than most of the other places in the area. They also have a small patio out front and a slightly larger patio in the back, which makes for good beer drinking in nice weather.  The food has all been pretty good from my experiences. Not necessarily impressive, but satisfying enough with no major issues or complaints. Most things on the menu are in the $10-$15 price range.    This weekend I split a cheese pizza and basket of sweet potato fries with a vegetarian friend of mine. The pizza was quite good with a thin crust and they brought olive oil, parmesan cheese and dried chillis to the table to help with making things even better. Sweet potato fries are a good thin cut and crispy rendition, however losing points on being served with a boring plain mayo to dip in (rather than a chipotle mayo or something a bit more interesting as most other places that charge $6 would offer). In a past visit I had the veal sandwich with fries which so far was the most notable thing I've had there, but with a vegetarian in tow last time, there was a moral dilemma of ordering a breaded baby cow sandwich.  The beer is a bit more expensive that most of the other places in the area ($17 - $21 ranging from a pitcher), but the food has more selection and better quality for other pub type places, so it redeems itself."}
{"text":"This is a great place, of course the pizza is good here! So are the burgers.  Food is really good, I have had the pizza, the burger, a salad, the beer battered fish and chips, and the nachos. The only thing better than the food is the service, which is great! The Staff is friendly and come around regularly to ask if you need anything else.  I came here afterwork with some friends and we ended up staying several hours, it gave us a chance to talk with the staff and the owners, whom are very friendly and will serve you with a smile. We have come back one more time for the same amount of time and had a great time."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, really really good fish and chips (surprisingly so), and a pizza selection that will make your mouth water. It's not a \"classy\" place, just a good old pub, where you can have some great food and relax with friends. It's also not excessively loud, which is a definitely plus... no one likes hearing a bad music selection over their friends."}
{"text":"The Brass Taps is a pub that has the good luck is being far enough away from the sketchiness of Sherbourne that it's in pleasant cabbagetown.  However, for business purposes, it has the bad luck of being on the otherside of sketchy Sherbourne for all the Ryerson and UofT kids.  The Brass Taps is just like any other pubbish place, with sports and fried pub food and the usual beers you'll find anywhere.  The times I've been there, it's been emptier than full, but there's usually some people there.  The staff is friendly and pretty quick on service."}
{"text":"This is a reliable pub to catch a game (they are pretty accommodating at finding the game you want), drink some decent beer, and have a tasty dinner.  The bartenders and servers are very friendly, know a lot about sports, and will talk to you or leave you alone depending on your mood.  Someone mentioned the beer choice wasn't good enough, but I thought it was fine. a lot of times these places serve only Labatt, Canadian and their ilk, but Brass Taps had Mill Street and some other fine pints on offer. For a pub, the food is very good. The pizza is their specialty and they have some good choices. I am partial to the anchovy. The wings are good too, and the \"hot\" ones are actually hot.   All in all, Brass Taps is a good local to cover your basic pub needs."}
{"text":"Came here because most things were closed/ too far away on a night i wasnt feeling great.  The boy ordered one of their pizzas... i dont remember the name only that it had goat cheese. And that goat cheese was really the only good thing about it. Im sure ill get disapprovals for this next statement but im sorry Canada just doesnt get pizza. Iv had canadian pizza at various time throughout my life and in 33 years i always have the same conclusion... i dont get how you can mess up dough/sauce/cheese.  Needless to say this place didnt change my mind. BUt hey Canada you guys got poutine down!! Every place that tries to rip it off in the states sucks at it miserably so its all good :)"}
{"text":"I am going to give this place a conditional 3 star review. When I came here it was after visiting a few pubs and more than a few handful of pints. We walked (Stumbled) into the place expecting a pub and turns out they are a full on restaurant.   I came here on a mission, to drink as much as humanly possible and then attempt to do it again but as we were seated nicely by the host/server/I can't really remember into a booth, I couldn't ignore the sights and smells of pizzas arriving at the table next to us. So, as any drunkard who has been drink since 3pm would do, we ordered up a slew of pizzas.   The pizzas came piping hot and looked absolutely glorious. Super cheese, shiny from grease, and good amount of toppings on this thin crust pie. Being served this on looks alone has already exceeded my expectations of this place. I took a bite and it tasted delicious. Although inebriated, I could tell it wasn't A-class pizza but it was still good. The sauce tasted a bit like tomato paste, the crust wasn't as thin or as crisp as expected, and the cheese was probably from those pre-grated \"mozzarella\" bags you get in the grocery but it was still good. I know that those were a lot of negative things to say but to sum it up, don't come here expecting top notch pizza but pizza here is still light years ahead of Pizza Pizza or Domino's and the beers on tap are fantastic.  Overall, a decent place to stop off for a pie if ever in the area. Good atmosphere and amazing prices. You definitely get more than you pay for here."}
{"text":"I wandered into the Brass Taps Pizza Pub while walking through Greektown over the weekend looking for some top notch Greek pizza (I mean, what other kind could you get in Greektown?) and boy, was I sorely disappointed. Form the outside the place actually looks pretty cool and the same can be said for the inside, nice old school pub feel to it. The menu has plenty of options from salads to burgers to all the stuff you would expect, and of course pizza, because it's in the name. We ordered a margarita pizza and what we got was something that looked like an alright pizza and tasted like something that  was definitely made with frozen dough (or 100% tasted like it) and came right out of the freezer aisle at the local Metro. I did not hate the pizza, but I barely liked it (not good, not bad). It was a super disappointing choice for lunch and I can surely say I will not be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Neighborhood pub.  Unpretentious.  Service can be slow, there was only one server and one chef when I visited.  Decent beer selection.  Food looked good, although I didn't have any."}
{"text":"im torn between 3 or 4 stars.  The place is really nice, there isn't a lot of seating but from what I can see the crowd isn't that big either. Awesome tap selection, I can't remember what exactly they had but they had a great selection of domestic (microbreweries) as well as imports. The menu is very Italian based, they do have your normal pub fare however.  I ordered the Irish nachos (curly fries topped with cheese, black olive, onion, jalapeno, bacon, and tons of other stuff) They were fucking brilliant.  I also got the southern cal pizza (I can't remember what was on it) and it was really good too, not gourmet or anything but exactly what you would want from a pub pizza.  The only problem I encountered here was when our food was held up for 45 minutes, for some reason our table was not served while everyone else was. The waitress should've addressed this herself but when we (politely) brought it up the manager promptly came to our table and promised that it was a mistake in the kitchen and that we would get our food shortly, as well as him half pricing our food.  He did everything he said he would. So I won't hold it against them, although thats probably the reason I didn't feel it was a 4 star experience. I believe it was an honest mistake though.  one more thing that I can't really blame them on is that this place seems to attract people with kids, shortly after we arrived a group of parents with TODDLERS were there letting them run amok much to the distaste of everyone in the back part. The pub itself doesn't have anything to appeal to kids so I don't know why them and another woman with her 11 year old daughter were there at 8pm on a Friday but they were. Again I can't blame this on the pub itself but I've never seen kids in any other bar at this time of day (and on a friday!)  all in all though, good food and a great beer selection on the danforth make this a great pub, im sure it will be worth 4 stars the next time I go.  Get the irish nachos"}
{"text":"Just got home from visiting Brass Taps with a friend of mine. The food was pretty rough, beers were standard, but the service was slow. Both me and my friend felt pretttty awful after eating the burgers. A definite bummer."}
{"text":"Brass Taps has quickly became my \"first date\" place to bring a girl. Access is the first reason: it is on a 24 hour streetcar line, a short walk from my apartment, and plenty of street parking is always available. The second, and probably more valid reason, is that it offers a great little atmosphere for any type of situation. When you first walk in there are a series of sofas in front of a fire place. Up a set of stairs is standard bar seating which also doubles as a performance area on certain days. Then towards the back there are the pool tables that have booths lining the walls.   The menus are fairly simple with their specialty being their pizza. Every day there is their daily special which is always a great deal and only includes things that people should order there like their pizza or lasagna. Having been there quite a few times already I have tried a large portion of their menu and have never been upset with my food, and neither has anyone I have been there with. On weeknights the service is a little slower as it is the bartender that also serves as a waiter, and the place is never empty enough to get constant attention. I am an impatient patron at times, but in all the times I have been to this Brass Taps I have only had to go up to the bar to get another beer once; that is a huge jump of an improvement from the location at Logan and Danforth. On weekends they always have a few more staff roaming around so you are never lacking in what you need.  I don't like to use this often as I have become somewhat of a regular (and I would find it to look a little cheap in front of a first date), but they have a 2 for 1 coupon available at http://www.dine.to/brasstaps_cabbagetown as well to help bring people into the bar. They also have their full menu and everything posted there, so give it a look-see. I have never been disappoint, and I don't think you will be either.  And on a very side note, don't let the rainbow \"gay pride\" flag on the outside keep you away if you are not homosexual, Brass Taps is a place for everyone!"}
{"text":"Great location, Good pizza, Great selection of beer. The only complaint would be the lame Jalapeno poppers!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The pizza is great.  Lost my glasses one time but a friend of mine made me new glasses out of a couple of the coasters. Didn't help with the old vision but was an upgrade in the style department. My old glasses were just my hands flipped on my face with my index finger touching my thumbs. Many of the staff noticed my new spectacles and said things like \"Wow\" and \"Oh yeah\" and \"Huh? I guess. Sure\" nice of them to say nice things.  Got into a car accident on the way home. In a wheelchair. Bar IS wheelchair accessible.  Can't say enough good things about the pizza."}
{"text":"Dropped in here with the Missus after work only because we had exhausted all the pubs near Pape so it was time to wander down the road a bit.  Found a booth just past the (open) kitchen and sat ourselves. The back end of the pub has 3 pool tables, a 2005 Golden Tee and a pinball (very excited about that! Both the Jester AND this place have pinball! Love it.) No one was hanging around in the back - it was a Monday, 5pm-ish - so they didn't have the TVs on or anything. But I think there was music playing.  Even in a Pizza Pub, neither of us ordered Pizza. I went for a cheeseburger, the Missus a pasta. And yes, I know there are a number of beers on tap, but was in the mood for a classic bottle of Bud, her a Coors. Both bottles VERY cold. Nice.   Food-wise, my burger hit the spot. Was it a home run? No, but didn't need it to be. It was reasonably priced, the fries were good, the bun fresh and the patty (seemingly) made in house. Perfect.  The Missus' pasta looked good enough, and was a large portion, so much so that she was able to save some for lunch (or, more likely, late night munchies tee hee..).  Service was fine. Pleasant, there when we needed her, quick to pack up the leftovers and get us our bill.  Will go back for the pizza next time, and maybe that Austrian beer one of the Foursquare Tips mentioned."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for dinner tonight. It was nice, clean and generally an alright atmosphere.   I am giving this place 2 stars because it was 'meh'.  We were served promptly in the beginning. I ordered an IPA that I never had before and didn't like it. I didn't return the beer, I just wanted to order a different one. The server said she would take it off the bill, and we said that was not necessary as there was nothing wrong with it, but she insisted that it was fine. She returned with the other beer saying she couldn't took the IPA off the bill and if I wanted a 'taster', to ask next time. This really was not an issue for us, as we both work in the restaurant industry and expected this anyway.  The server took our order. About 20 minutes later, she came back to the table, asking what our order was as she got caught up talking to \"Jimmy\" at the bar and couldn't remember what we ordered ( I have no idea who Jimmy is. I'm sure he's a nice guy).   I made a good living as a server myself so these things irritate me.  I ordered a tuna melt in a wrap, and my friend ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. My wrap came as a sandwich. Not a big deal, right? It took another 15-20 minutes to get it back to the table as a wrap. By this time I nearly finished half of my friends meal as we were quite hungry at this point and didn't expect the meal to take over an hour. The restaurant wasn't busy so I do not understand what the hold up was.  The food was what you would expect for pub grub; not bad, not outstanding."}
{"text":"Prices are a little high. But again, the staff are quite polite and friendly. I ordered the chicken wings and they are very high quality. Though the prices of the wings are getting so expensive now. Just two years ago they were 11.29 and now they are 14.56. That's a little high for just chicken wings as a snack. Other than that, all their other prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Great pub. Friendly staff. Fairly priced draft. 17 taps. Excellent pub food. Nice, plump wings. 3 pool tables. Stocked juke box. What more can I say!? It's a great casual place to hang."}
{"text":"Brass Taps is fine and generally inoffensive, but I would never come here on my own outside of a baseball team event.  The okay: - The breaded chicken sandwich is acceptable.  Ask for the mayo on the side - The calzones are okay - The patio is alright - They take debit - The staff is generally alright - Very accommodating to large groups  The bad: - I have never loved my food here, but it has never really been THAT bad - The beers always taste slightly watery/funny - It's too expensive for the quality of food (but the portions are very large)  So the summary is, thank you for welcoming my baseball team every week and having good service, your food is not amazing but it's not that bad, and the restrooms are usually clean."}
{"text":"This is a good place for a drink and some good ole pub grub. If that's what you want... go here... If you expect more, or want 'fancy' , I suggest you go somewhere else. They have daily specials (everything is good) but I'd say the pizza is your best bet for food. They have pin ball, golden tee, and some pool tables. If you have a bunch of people try to get the 'big booth' or head to the back where it's more open. On 'game nights' the place gets rammed and that's the only time the service is less than amazing. I've been going here off and on for about 15 years."}
{"text":"One of the better bars on the Danforth. The outside patio is perfect for a sunny afternoon, the food is good and the staff are friendly.  The beer selection also sets Brass Taps apart. They have a ton of beers on tap, and you can get anything in a 1/2 or full pint. Definitely nice when you only want a beer or two with lunch but also want to try a couple different options."}
{"text":"Wings were subpar. Pizza was ok. Service was terrible. Took 20 mins to take out order and weren't very attentive so when we tipped accordingly the waitress asked us to our face why the tip was so low. Unacceptable. Very rude. Would not visit again just for the low quality of service."}
{"text":"Meh sums up this experience pretty well.  We have been eying this restaurant for some time, as it's SO close to my place, and who doesn't love pizza? Finally the weather warmed up, so we decided to go and check on the patio.  First mistake: Leafs game. There are a ton of regulars who come here to watch, so if you're not into a bunch of yelling fans, probably choose another night. There are two patios, but as the front one was full, we headed to the back. It is partially covered, but that didn't stop a LOT of people from smoking, which wasn't ideal for me. Alas.   We ordered a drink, an appetizer, and a pizza each, and I have to admit I was slightly disappointed by each of these orders.   Drink: the waitress had the beer list memorized, but she told me they had beers that they didn't actually have, so I had to make my way through a few requests before getting a drink.  Appetizer: jalapeno poppers - definitely the ones bought at a grocery store frozen, which was a bit disappointing. The jalapenos tasted like freezer, and they were served on a weird bed of chopped lettuce. I was definitely disappointed after those.  Pizza: Definitely hand made thin crust, which was great, but there was a bit too much cheese-y greasiness. It didn't taste bad, but with a place that advertises itself as a \"pizza pub\" I was definitely expecting better.   So, I'm happy I tried it but I won't be back. There are better patios and better pizza just down the street from Brass Taps."}
{"text":"This place is like a home away from home! A local hangout with awesome pizza and wings. Staff is killer too!"}
{"text":"Before I \"really\" moved downtown, during the transition days of painting and shifting of possessions, my roommates and I relied on tasty grilled chicken sandwiches from Brass Taps to sustain us while working into the night. We were (at least, I was) not quite oriented, unaware of what stretched out in either direction beyond the couple blocks at College and Dovercourt.   Four years later, I find myself relying on this establishment for late-night take-out meals and impromptu get-togethers, particularly when laziness or inclement weather hinders movement (it's located about 50 feet from my front door).  Yes, it started out as a relationship based on convenience, but has evolved into a very specific source of craving-- for their rather awesome sweet potato fries, steak sandwiches (whose awesomeness admittedly sometimes fluctuates in its take-out form), and delicious array of pizzas. I usually find myself ordering the first one I tried, by chance, when I finished a friend's leftovers (#10, Ortolana), but find their lunch special (1/2 of a pre-determined pizza and salad for $5.99) the perfect opportunity to adventurously sample which ever number from 1-27 they have selected for me that day. A similar deal exists with pasta and soup and sandwich options for around the same price, FYI.  Wireless internet, friendly service, a consistently kickass playlist, and a cool. unaffected crowd, help round out the experience that adds up to more than mere proximity."}
{"text":"This is as good as any pub gets...reasonably priced food, a half decent set of taps, generous wait staff that allow for samples of what they have if you can't find exactly what you're looking for.  They are very kid friendly and I often bring my three girls in...the kids menu is perfect and the adult portions are ample enough to share.  With pool tables and pinball, everyone is entertained while the food is getting prepared.  The servers are very accommodating and bring the drinks to wherever we are in the bar.  The food is quite a bit better than average pub fare...the burgers are perfect...the pizza is awesome (with many choices)!  Enough can not be said about the staff...they are genuinely friendly and extremely attentive."}
{"text":"This was one of our stops on our Yelp Dufferin Grove pub crawl.  We literally came in, did a shot of tequila and left to grab food at Hadley's.  The place is dingy, the bathroom smelled funny, but our waitress was cute and nice. There was a good sized crowd for a Tuesday night with most seemingly hanging out to watch the game. Would like to come back and try the food, but I think I'll wait for an warm summer day to enjoy their patio.  February Food-Free Yelping Challenge 8/29"}
{"text":"First impression is really important on the first date.   Brass Taps Pizza Pub really makes a good impression. The dark and \"cozy\" down to earth vibe, the friendly crowd and the helpful waitress.  My quickie Tequila shot ($6) sealed the deal.  I will be back again, my second date will hopefully involve some finger licking food!"}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch on a Sunday. I saw they have pizza and that's what I was looking for. The one staff member working was very nice but not very attentive. We ordered a cheese pizza and I'm 100% sure it was a frozen pizza. At least the dough was definitely frozen. It didn't taste fresh and at all. I was very unimpressed with my food here."}
{"text":"After going there on and off for about 10 years now I can say 2 things. Yes they have good pizza, but they continually employ impolite, combative, and unprofessional servers for behind the bar. If you're after great pizza there are plenty of other/better options not far down the road in Little Italy where you don't have to put up with impertinent servers.   If incompetent service and despondent drunken locals hanging off the bar are your thing then please go to the Brass Taps you'll love it.   If your just after a drink or 2 and want friendly professional service in a nice environment then go a few doors down to the Emmit Ray like somebody else said in their review.  It's getting 2 stars just for the food as the kitchen staff are always friendly and make pretty good pizza. Perhaps if I was sitting at the bar and not a table the service would have been different. I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"I agree if this place could get less than 1 star that's what I would give them for their service!!! Our server was horrible, this must be his first restaurant job cause he suck!!!   We went as a group last Wednesday, it was a young guy with facial hair that was our server, he kept complaining that our group of 20 was to large he wouldn't be able to Serve everyone for 45 min to an hour. He was so rude about 4 decided not to even order. This restaurant used to be so much better. To bad it sucks now."}
{"text":"Nice traditional pub kind of pub.  Lots of wood, lots of beer, good, filling food options and some sports on the telly.  I lived literally right around the corner from this place during my stay in Toronto so it was an attractive idea to throw on some shoes head to Brass Taps and grab a beer or see if they were showing the tennis match I was missing out on.  (Sadly that one night they weren't.)  So they have good location and environment, good beer (location of my first Alexander Keith's) in large quantities and good pizza (also in large quantities).  So yeah, \"Yay! I'm a fan.\""}
