{"text":"Love the chickpeas and Chana bhatura of this place.....but the lineup and no sense of system on serving customers even after taking a number"}
{"text":"I got curly black hair in my food too many times.  I quit going there"}
{"text":"Probably one the best Samosa's in town. Hate the fact they are always busy but understandably so. The 5 samosa's for a dollar is a fantastic deal and their gulab jamuns are good as well. Id try their other stuff too but like to stick to their \"Samosa only\" lines and they move faster."}
{"text":"Sweets: 
I had pista barfi, kalakan, ludoo, gulab jamun and I really liked it.  8/10
Nan:
Not so good, when I compared it to other places. It was smaller but I didn't mind this as it's only $1 but I didn't like the taste. 4/10
Chaat Papri: good, tasty. 7/10
Palak Paneer: tasty. 7/10

Will be returning to try other snacks.

Other stuff. I was there on labor day around 2.30pm and it wasn't too busy. they don't have AC, so it got kinda hot waiting for the food. Service was great and the people who take the orders wear nets on their head and the place is very clean.

Ordering: When you enter, you have to take a number (from machine on left, near door) and then they call out your number."}
{"text":"Great samosas. Really cheap if you buy them in bulk. :D The only downside is it usually takes a while for you to get your food."}
{"text":"What makes this place popular is how they offer good quality food at extremely good prices.

We ordered take out food for a dinner party, 3 kinds of appetizers, 3 curries (big size), 2 sweet dishes - enough quantity to feed 3 families. I was surprised to see our bill came under $50. 

Overall, the main course tasted good. Their samosas were nice as well. There is a lady who takes down the take out order, she is quite helpful in guiding about the sizes and what food she recommends. 

Service is good but they could improve how the queues work, lots of confused faces and little management on that front. 

Bonus points for cleanliness!"}
{"text":"Always great for Samosas and sweets!  Various sizes for Samosas and great prices.  Love their carrying box for take out when you get lots of Samosas."}
{"text":"The food is  not good it is delicous. This really is a great Punjabi resturant. Just a fair warning there are no chairs inside, so you will end up eating in your car or at home. But that does not stop the BILLIONS of people that go there. The food is amazing. Be careful coming in around Indian lunch time (1-2 pm) since it is packed, we have gone to canada twice and both times we end up taking pounds mithai.  This resturant is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"I discovered this heavenly place thanks to my co-workers, they buy their samosas here...

It's the most delicious samosas I ever tasted (and I frequent indian restaurants a lot), 
the filling is nicely flavoured, not spicy and the perfect size..

I can't wait to try their sweets here, especially the gulab jamun..


..but why must you be so far from me ?? :'("}
{"text":"Is your time worth saving a few dollars on crappy samosas? Waited 35 minutes for 5 samosas. It didn't help that a large group of customers cut in front of me in line but it happens every time I come here so I am used to it at this point. 

There's no way I am returning after this experience. Even if these samosas cost a nickel I wouldn't come back. Enjoy your serving your rude customers."}
{"text":"I love fast food Indian. When it is done right it's even better. This place is awesome with high turnover and delicious food. I came here the first time when I was in Brampton/Mississauga area a year ago and loved it. Came back again for a wedding and had to make a stop here. The service could be a little better but honestly I don't care Bc I love the food. The samosas are not oily at all and fresh and crunchy. The chaat and bhel are fresh, spicy, and the servings are great. If you love Indian fast food then definitely go if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This is a very popular Indian Samosa and Sweet place due to their freshness and consistency. We always get snacks and sweets from here for every of our events. The prices are also very reasonable for the quality of food. Since they are always busy call ahead to place your order."}
{"text":"We preordered two hundred samosas for an event a few days before. The time we reserved for was 8am, but we were not given the actual products until 8:30. Needless to say, we were not happy with that... And based off of the other clientele waiting with us that morning, it was a shared sentiment. One even loudly complained, \"I have to go to work soon.\" I wouldn't be as upset if there weren't chefs staring back at us from the kitchen like deer caught in headlights and then chitchating. However, the samosas were tasty and the sauce that came with it  definitely complimented them. Would I order from them again? Yes, but I would reserve 30mins to an hour ahead of when I would actually show up."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 0 star if it were possible. Such a waste of my time, money and effort to come here after hearing positive reviews from others. 

First, you have to take a ticket and stand in line, the cashier goes through the numbers so quickly like if you don't immediately say you are there, they will skip you and move on, even though I was standing right behind the person in front of me. She was quite nonchalant and could care less for customers.  I understand they are a busy place however, it would be nice if they were a little nicer to their customers. 

We ordered - potato pea samosas, paneer tikka samosas, spring rolls, naan, shahi paneer and vegetable biryani. 

It took a while for them to get out the order but everything was super cold. The potato pea samosa were basic nothing special, the paneer tikka samosa I could not try as they messed up my order and gave me alo tikka samosa, which is basically the same as the potato pea samosa just colored red inside. And there's no way for them to verify they got the orders wrong since it's the stuffing inside and you would have to eat it to know. That was disappointing. The spring rolls were old and refried, yet cold. They tasted horrible and literarily got tummy cramps after eating the rotten cabbage inside. 

The naan wasn't even a naan, it was a long flat parata texture. It was like eating a thicker roti. The vegetable biryani was turmeric rice with some veggies and cashews thrown in. No flavor, no spice, super bland, they did not even salt it. Another disappointment. But the worst dish was the shahi paneer, completely garbage and inedible. It was basically tomato paste mixed with chunks of paneer and tons of garam masala. All you can taste was the garam masala. This was the worst Indian dish I ever tasted in my life. 

The prices are cheap because the quality is below par. The samosas are not even good, and nor is the food. The customer service is the worst and I can't believe people actually like to eat here. Can't say anything about the sweets as I've never tried it (thank god). I regret eating here and definitely would not come back or recommend this place to anyone. There are tons of better options in Toronto so don't waste your time or money, even though it's a cheap and gross eat."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my Samosas!!!

Location: Did a few u-turns, the location is not exposed as it's in a small plaza located not on Albion Rd but off a side road north of Albion. Parking beware...there's a sign that says \"Tenant Parking\" not sure this may be an issue if you get caught parking there. Not many available spots, which was a good sign to me that this restaurant is good!!!

Menu: I only ordered potato samosas, spinach samosas & cheese samosas, which were excellent. The spinach was my favourite (I'm also a spinach lover)! I wanted Biryani but they didn't have any left. The taste~excellent, including the sweet & relish ~ spicy looking dip. And not at all greasy.  

Cost: Spinach samosas 3/$1, cheese samosas 3/$1 & potato samosas 5/$1 & mango shake $1.99. 

A bit confusing, the ordering process, I waited in the line & also took a #. When your order is complete, there's also a # on your receipt, they'll call. 

Overall...great place, my family enjoyed their samosas....we'll be back."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and good quality sweets, desserts and chat items. I have never seen laddoo sell for 2.99/ pound anywhere in toronto. I like the mango shake, Chana bhatura and their thaali. There's always a line up but you wouldn't mind that for good quality eh! Customer service is also awesome. Would go there whenever I get a chance :-)"}
{"text":"Extremely busy, but quick service! Easy to tell why its so busy.. food is amazing. 

The samosas are delicious, and inexpensive! The staff are friendly and helpful. Took home some food, including Matar Paneer and Palak paneer, both awesome heated up for dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped here after work, service was quick and friendly. I sampled all three samosas and they were good but not sure if I would go out of my way to get them again. I also ordered chaat papri which was very good but could have been amazing with tomatoes and cilantro. When I've ordered it elsewhere it had been included, not sure if you had to ask? In any case, I would go back for chat papri but I would make sure they include tomatoes and cilantro."}
{"text":"Great deal on samosas. 5 for $1 or a box of 50 for $10. Make sure you get the 2 sauces as well. Great idea for apps when hosting. Good curry lunch specials and very friendly. Haven't tried the desserts but they look interesting. Make sure you keep you're place in line or people will bud. There doesn't seem to be a system in place."}
{"text":"Samosas for $1 is great!! Snacks are good. But we ordered Biryani which turns out a pulao. But I'll definitely go to this place for samosas (only for samosas)"}
{"text":"My co-worker brought samosas in for Diwali delicious !!! I definitely need to go back and get a box for myself"}
{"text":"This place is always extremely busy and for good reason!  You must take a number when you enter, if ordering anything besides samosas.  Listen closely for your number, as they will go right along to the next person if you aren't quick! 

Anyway, the sweets are heaven!!!!!  I have yet to try the samosas, though they smelled scrumptious while I was there.  

I ordered a box of 20 sweets (approximately 2 pounds) which costed about $8 after tax.  All sweets are 100% vegetarian so that is great news for me.  The lady serving me was very nice and patient, and I let her recommend to me the sweets she liked best.  Considering how busy it is, the servers are extremely friendly.  Two thumbs up for both great service and amazing products."}
{"text":"Amazing somsoas at a wholesale prices for consumers. A maze of customers at stores and a little wait is worth the fresh out of the oven delicious triangles if gold."}
{"text":"Garbage people. Don't ever go here. They are rude and have no understanding of good customer service and their food is mediocre at best. Should be avoided at all costs."}
{"text":"Strong 3 stars for the samosa alone. I would say the samosa are pretty good but nothing worth going back for."}
{"text":"Samosa's and milk cake to die for, if you can forgive the crowd who don't seem to comprehend what orderly is.lol. Worth a visit even though it's in an industrial area"}
{"text":"Yelp family: you know I must love you all to share of my favourite spots ever!
There are a few things that I consider addictive: pizza, empanadas and somosas!

This place has the very best somosas I've ever eaten. Its a local spot that you know is good because you have to take a number and wait in line and people in front of you and behind you are buying food by the boxes. Its a factory so you are getting FRESH food!

And the price is unreal! I'm serious!! Unreal!! Under $10 for two bags full of somosas!"}
{"text":"Had a dinner party and made Indian Food but didn't want to make the samosas!!!  Nice variety of veggie fillings:  Paneer tikka masala, saag paneer and potato with peas.

Fillings were very tasty. The sauces were not.  The batter isn't too oily so that's a bonus.  I still prefer besan flour (chickpea flour) in the wrapper but I haven't had one like that in a long, long time.

Anyhow for the price and variety, just buy your own sauce.  It's very good especially if you're watching your fried oily intake as these are less oily than most."}
{"text":"The Place looks clean
The food is good and the price is good 

but if you're buying take out just remember that they don't have disposable plates"}
{"text":"My family is picky on samosas but they definitely love it here and we think they have the best!! Always busy, best connection with their customers, extremely worth it! LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I was in the Albion Road and Carrier Drive area of Etobicoke and decided to Yelp popular restaurants in the area. This led us to Samosa and Sweet Factory. 

If purchasing sweets one does need to take a number. The line up for the sweets orders was quite long. The cashier mentioned something about it being a festival (Google tells me it is the Punjabi New Year or Baisakhi). There are several displays of sweets and snacks as well as an area to purchase hot food. Will have to return another time to try some of the sweet treats and hot food.

To purchase samosas we didn't need to take a number and we proceeded to cashier #3 as the signs indicated. I mentioned it was my first visit to their store and inquired about the flavours of samosas available. We ended up purchasing 5 potato and peas samosas for $1, and 3 spinach and potato samosas for $1. 

There was a short wait for the samosas to be prepared. The spinach and potato samosa was quite flavourful and had plenty of filling. I enjoyed the potato and peas samosa a bit better, mainly because it seemed they had prepared it more recently and thus the dough was quite crispy and hot. 

8 samosas for $2 is a great deal. I prefer the lighter texture of their dough compared to some other places I've tried (like Babu) and the samosas didn't seem greasy. I know I will be back for more!

(43/100)"}
{"text":"Samosas are good and cheap but came here today was told it would be a 10-15 min for our samosas. Since we were told the wait time we came during our break. We ended up waiting for 30 min!!Asked them where our order is they told us it was given to someone else by mistake. If we hadn't asked we would still be waiting. Asked for a refund and told them we needed to go back to work but the worker refused to give or money back told us it would only be another 10 min wait. We decided to wait but ended up waiting for another 20 min!!! They didn't even apologize. Lack of customer service. Love their samosas but definitely not coming back here myself."}
{"text":"I reluctantly give this place 5 stars. I say that only because of the line ups and I feel that their system could be greatly improved. But it didn't feel right hitting them with less than 5 stars because their food and prices are so damn good. I always get their samosas and everyone LOVES them - at your next event you have to get them... your guests will love them!  At 5/$1 you can't go wrong. This is a place that I crave every now and then."}
{"text":"Mostly I'd suggest visiting at OFF PEAK hours, lunch can be brutal (lines). Few times I've been it was slow and confused service. Great deal on samosa's and mango. Good if u work or live close."}
{"text":"GMP regulated facility (which means it is regulated to a higher degree than restaurants are) which shows as people are wearing beard nets and hair nets. Good food and good prices. Don't cheap out and buy the small somosas. Buy the big ones for just a few dimes more. I don't like Indian sweets but they have them too. Very very busy so make sure you go early."}
{"text":"This is the best place to come for an introduction to Indian foods from the north region of India. Such amazing prices and fantastic quality foods.  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK! Too bad only one location, wish they had more."}
{"text":"Ok this is my review for 07/04/15 - We visited Samosa Factory with my sister and  other family  after hearing very good reviews from my sister.

Food Quality - 1 star
1. I would say it is totally overrated. I realized after a quick bite from my Thali. Well food was mediocre range and total disappointment. Not sure all reviews ...

Cold Thali ? - 0 stars
1. Yes we realized at 11.57 am purchased Thali was cold and I thought it was just mine. Immediately every one said same that the food was cold. My sister went inside immediately to let them know that food was cold and asked if it was today's food. The reply we got was the person at the counter says --- of course we are always fresh food. He than looks at the food warmers and all burners are off and the water was left in cold. No wonder our food was let in cold.

2. What pissed me off was they never offered us to even consider to replace our thalis since it was there mistake. Well they are busy and they gave me a weird look as \"who cares dude please move on ?\"

3. My sisters Father in law got sick after an hour threw up...so confirms the cold food left over all morning.

Sweets - 5 stars
1. Sweets are awesome.. no doubt they are best. All tasted very fresh and good. Jalebi top notch, milk cakes, and other sweet dont know names but all tasted the best. 

All of the above adds up 1,0,5  and my rating is 2 stars. 

Advice - Please be courteous and after we mention the food was not warm and that too admitting there mistake should have avoided my uncle from food poisoning.

Any ways.. this is my review.

Thank you."}
{"text":"Curries were all watered down and way too sweet. Why they add so much sugar to the curries is beyond me! They need to add more spices, it was way too mild and tasteless. Was not impressed. You are better off to go to Brars."}
{"text":"Samosas and Sweet Factory, you sorely tested my love for my husband! I ordered several bags of samosas, a box of sweets and your Kachori Chaat. Ripped open the plastic wrapper of the Kachori Chaat box and tasted one in the parking lot. Mmmm ....freshly made for me, it was delicious. Nice combination of spices in the chickpeas and sweet crunch from the tomatoes and other fresh items.

The Kachori Chaat order contains 2 of these beauties and I finished 2/3 of 1 in my parked car. Now the Big Dilemma: 

Should I start driving home so that I could give the other beauty to my dear husband? Or should I finish eating my own portion first and risk that his would get soggy?

In the end, I stopped eating and drove home. And he enjoyed 1/2 of his portion and let me eat the rest. So we were both happy and our marriage withstood The Kachori Chaat Challenge.

For dessert, I enjoyed a sampler of the different sweets I bought. Excellent quality, full of nutty goodness and not too sweet. The 'cashew Apple' is very cute. Next week, I will find another excuse to drive 30 minutes from home again to try some more sweets."}
{"text":"Lurking out among a bunch of light industrial malls is this no nonsense Indian food store that makes samosas, pakoras, paneer, and various Indian sweets. It's all cash 'n' carry. I think normally they have 3 piping hot samosas for $1 but when I went in there they were offering 5 for $1, including a salsa like green sauce and a sweet and sour red sauce. I'd challenge you to pack away 3 in one sitting. But five? For a $1? Oh man. I thought the $5 foot long was the deal o' the century in terms of cheap dining.

Other delights include these things that look suspiciously like chicken mcnuggets but turn out to be paneer, crisp pakoras, and a kind of sandwich fried up pakoras style.

Oh yeah the gulab jamuns are beyond fraking amazing. They have this buttery kick to them totally lacking in versions I've had at Indian restaurants. Forget tim bits, lay out a box of these. 

Everything is not only cheap and filling but nicely spiced. Nothing mouth burning. Just enough heat to let you know you're not eating oatmeal. And the spices serve to render complex flavors.

Many items are sold by weight but you can (and we just did) layout out lunch for a small software development company for $25.

The place opens at the crack of 11 am and you need to get there at the crack of 11 am because lines form quickly."}
{"text":"If you have nothing better to do with your time.  Food is okay.  Absolutely not worth the wait.  There is better food available elsewhere without the wait.  Cannot figure out why it is so popular.  They do not accept phone orders just to make you wait."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!!! Super cheap, I always love the samosas even though I dont like spicy food, but its too good. The sweets are heavenly. 5 samosas for a dollar. What a bargain! Seriously, check this place out. The distance from wherever you are is worth the trek and the line is worth waiting in."}
{"text":"Love this place. Lunch thali is $3.99 for two veg curries with rice AND naan. The naan is not my favourite, not as crispy or flavourful as other naan I've had, but still not bad. The portion sizes are pretty good. I love that they have so many paneer dishes. My favourite is the Palak paneer. The potatoes and pea samosas are only $1 for 5 and delicious! Not to mention these are also sold frozen. I have been here 4 times the past month and I plan to keep coming here and trying everything. If you come here near lunch hour, it is packed. The store also confuses people. You take a number, order, pay, then they call your number so you can pick your hot table items."}
{"text":"My review is solely based on their samosas.

At 5 samosas for $1, really, where can you go wrong?  The samosas are always fresh and piping hot. The red sauce they give...sooo good!  The veggie/potato filling is so delicious and they don't have all that extra dough like some other samosas.

I deducted one star because the service is really hit or miss.  Sometimes they're really slow and I just wanna pull my hair out, other times I'm in and out of there in 5 minutes.

Anyways, if you're ever in the area and need something to take to a party, go here!  Anyone that has ever tried these samosas has never not liked them."}
{"text":"This place has come a long way from being a place one would line up for cheap samosas. it's all that and more vegetarian cuisine. 

Let's get this out of the way, this is a take out place. period. they the word factory in the name and they are definitely that when you see the volume of food they put out each and every day. 

if you need Samosas, they have them at 5 for $1. for a long time, at least 10 years I've been coming here for that very reason. they're excellent value. they also, like many stores of this type, are able to serve multiple other food items. 

They specialise in your traditional Indian appetizers, deep fried, baked, cooked in large batches, etc. my favourite is the small (they call medium) samosas because there is no way you can beat the price. 

every order I've made the last 3 times I've been here has been piping hot and fresh out of the fryer. you get that crispy crunch with that soft but nicely flavourful potato, pea and other flavours inside. 

parking is somewhat challenging with the massive volume of orders they take for catering, take out and of course samosas and sweets. but the value is there. if you ever want to look like a hero a lot a pot luck or some sort of event, go here.

4.0 out of 5.0 for value for money, quality, and freshness."}
{"text":"This place is great. Went to visit a friend and brought over some samosa and they were a big hit. It's always busy but that's a great sign. The sweets look wonderful as well. It's worth the stop to try the best samosa I have had."}
{"text":"Best place for samosas.  Hands down. Will be going here to pick up samosas from now on."}
{"text":"Wow. This is a place I've heard about for years, but for some reason or the other never ended up going. What amazing samosas..
Pro: The samosas!! Absolutely delicious. They came piping hot just made. I included an image of the paper bag that they came on to show that there wasn't any excess oil in or around them. That's a feat in itself. Well filled. Slightly smaller than I'm used to but not a concern I just had a couple extra to make up. I had the spinach and cheese samosas. Nicely flavoured, well seasoned not overpowering. 3 samosas for $1 same as most places. I will need to make sure I try  fried stuffed bread next time. 

Cons: I tried the mango lassi. Wasn't appetizing at all. Too thin, and had a very aftermarket taste to put it. As if it just came from a bottle. Not that nice. The sauces that came with the samosa though, lacked a tad. Too watery and not enough flavour. 

All in all recommend 100%. Will update this review once I've tried the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The lines may be long but they're samosas are really good! They're price is ridiculously affordable for tasty food.  It's quite a travel if you don't live in the west end of the city."}
{"text":"We get appetizers and sweets from here on a regular basis. You have to obtain a ticket and wait for your number to be called so it's fairly organized. The food is great and it's a good place to purchase bulk samosas and other appetizers for parties and get togethers for a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"OMG Ave sure you have at least 15 minutes to wait when going here!! VERY VERY busy little place, but for sure the BEST samosa we've ever had. We have been doing business with them for several years and any school event we have we arrive with samosa."}
{"text":"Need to feed a ton of people for cheap?  Samosas!  100 samosas for under $30 is ridiculous!  Both vegetarians and non-vegetarians loved the samosas from here.  The service is quick and efficient and in no time I was hulling back 100 samosas in a big cardboard box in my car.  

Got a big party, corporate event, birthday party, bachelor party, potluck and don't know what to bring?  Samosas is never the wrong answer.  The best part is this sweet honey sauce that comes with the samosas too.  There is no minimum order and if I was around this part of town more often I'd eat samosas for lunch more often.  The best is the potato and peas, however I've tried their meat samosas and they are good too.  They don't taste nearly as good frozen and reheated however, so eat them fresh when possible."}
{"text":"I used to buy bite size samosas from this place for my friends. The price is amazing for the quantity , it always tasted good  but recently i had some and it tasted and smelled like plastic . 

Other than samosas, they also have Indian sweets and snacks which are good."}
{"text":"On a Saturday afternoon, this takeout place was PACKED.  When I checked out the menu, I understood why...it's CHEAP!  

For example, Mango Shake - $1.50, Samosas - 3-5, depending on the filling, for $1, and a generous serving of Chat Papri - $3!  I didn't order this particular item, but a Veg Thali with 3 items was $3.99, 5 items was $5.99.

Mango Shake was pretty decent, just watered down mango yogurt, but still enjoyable.  And \"medium\" Samosas were actually small in size.  Still good value though as the potato/pea ones were 5/$1 and piping hot!  I also tried the Masala Samosas and that was nice, def on the spicier side.

Chat Papri a.k.a. Indian Nachos (as I call it) was very tasty!  Tangy, sweet, and a bit spicy too.  Good snack and large portion.

As per the name, they also sell a wide variety of indian sweets if you're into that sort of thing.

First visit was a bit overwhelming, but the other patrons were helpful, instructing me how it's done.  :)

Tip:  Take a number, listen intently for it to be called, give the lady your order, and wait for your number again once your order is fulfilled."}
{"text":"Great! Been going for years. 

The lines are ridiculous most of the time and they aren't exactly the most organized, but it is worth the wait. Just make sure you give yourself some extra time when you go."}
{"text":"I have zero knowledge about Indian sweets, except for the fact that they are soooo delicious! I was only familiar with Soan Papdi, which they unfortunately didn't have! But it was okay because I tried a box of assorted Indian sweets that I wish I knew the names of because they were all waaaaay too good! It was pretty busy the time I came around lunch time. I wasn't sure how to order so I got whatever looked good. It was my first time here, ordered the box of sweets and then decided to also order thali. I personally didn't like how veg. thali tasted, but obviously I was eating with my eyes first, so I ordered one of everything, got all the colours of the rainbow and tried most of them. It wasn't what I was expecting, I kind of thought I was just eating dipping sauce with rice and bread (the bread was soo good tho!!), I wished for meat the entire time. But overall it was a great experience and will definitely come back at an earlier time for some more Indian sweets!!!"}
{"text":"We came here to pick up some samosas and sweets. We also grabbed some mango \"shakes\" which were super cheap, but I would not call it a shake at all. 

Starting with the samosas, there is a separate line so you don't have to take a number and wait in the long lines if that is all you want. They have different sizes and we got the ones that were 5 for $1. They are pretty good considering the price and size. There is plenty of filling and  the ratio to the wrapper is perfect. The ones at Samosa King in Scarborough are also very good, but the filling is different and there is a lot of the dough compared to these ones. The tamarind sauce that came with it didn't look appetizing at all. Just looked like a sugar-water sauce with red food colouring. Nowhere near a real tamarind sauce. I just threw it out so I can't comment on the taste. I'm sure it would have been similar to a sweet and sour or duck sauce with some tamarind flavour hiding in the background. 

The sweets we got were yellow peda and a mixed barfi box. Both were ready-made on the side to-go. We didn't have time to wait in the long line. These were actually very fresh as well. I've seen the same packages at grocery stores, but those are not as fresh as these. I would recommend them if you don't have time for the line. 

The mango \"shakes\"  we got were awful. It was nowhere close to a shake and there was no ice cream in it (which is what comes to my mind when I hear \"shake\"). It simply tasted like they blended milk with a very tiny amount of mango pulp. It's only $1.50 so I guess it's not a huge loss. I wouldn't get them again though. 

Overall, this is not a bad place. They have a bunch of other snacks and even curries and other items for catering. I'll try some of their other food items the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Have been told to check this place out, so I did.
I called and gave 30 minutes notice for 200 samosa and they filled the order with ease. Was handed a box full of piping hot and fresh samosas.
Also picked up a lb of ladoo and a lb of jelabi. Both looked fresh, but I didn't have any.

The prices in comparison to other places in Brampton or Mississauga are way better and dare I say, worth the drive! I love that it opens as early as 7:30 am so you can pick up for your work day."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing 
Even though the lines are really long it's worth the wait I love it best Indian food I've had in a long time !!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since high school when I first got introduced to samosas. It's the place to go for cheap and delicious samosas, but the nature of their business is takeout so there aren't places to sit and eat. 

Yesterday, I had a craving for shahi paneer and it didn't disappoint. I also tried the mango shake and it's more like a cold mango smoothie - it's not frozen and it tastes like the mango pudding you get at dim sum restaurants.

The wait can be a bit because it's so busy here, but they try their best to get things moving!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the spice level is just right. But the process on how to order the food is unclear. We were not sure which line to stand in. 

Takes a bit of time to order the food, but after that the process is fast.

The Naan for the Thaali was too hard and small.

For the price this place is good. Would return and recommend it."}
{"text":"I just bought their frozen Rasmalai. ( in Kirkland,Wa) and it was the best I ever had!"}
{"text":"Got the 5 for $1 medium size potato and pea samosas on a Friday morning at 9am before the long weekend... There was a bit of a lineup. Samosa filling has a bit of a kick and now come in bags if you buy bulk and don't want to pay extra $0.75 for a box. Comes with the red and green sauce. Delicious! Fresh and hot because of the time I went obviously; definitely one of the BETTER samosa places because of their filling.

In the afternoon, once cooled down, they tasted spicier."}
{"text":".33cents a samosa !!!
.16cents mixed sweets!! 

Right in front of a TTC bus stop and I swear the driver pulled over just to grab a snack! 

Very fresh! Very clean! Fast service! Very busy! Amazing delicious food!"}
{"text":"This is an all veggie Indian place. One side is solely for sweets and other side is for hot table foods. There's a number ticket machine and be sure to grab one and ignore the sign that says \"grab tickets for sweets\" lol. I didn't get one cause I was following the side but turns out it was for hot table side too lol.. anyways this place is popular for their Samosas. And dam its hella cheap. 

You can get 5 small samosas for $1 or 3 large for $1. Think they also had cheese and spinach ones too. I had those before and they were good too. I ordered a few small samosas to bring back home and a garlic naan (1.50). Also ordered a curry. Forgot what this one is called but I asked for the most spiciest one - which was not spicy. Basically had some beans and tofu in it. Dipped the garlic naan in it and woo it was good. 

I would come again for the bulk samosas!"}
{"text":"Wow - a friend had told me about this place for samosas and it being a bit out of the way but holy - is it ever good!  I ended up getting dinner for two for $5.19 including tax.  What a bargoon!

The name is pretty accurate - it is actually a huge factory in Rexdale, with a little counter to order from.  Medium samosas are 5 for $1 as Karl R. said, and they have vegetable chalis (combos I guess it means?) which range from $2.99 (for rice and 1 veg side) to $3.99 (for rice and 2 veg sides).  These were all really fresh, and really delicious.  

The lineups can be daunting, but are worth it!  

I unfortunately didn't get to try any of the barfis or gulab jamuns or rasmalai or other yummy looking desserts because I had ODed on jalebis during the week, but they looked incredibly fresh.  As Ahhhnold says, \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"Great place to pick up samosas. 5 delicious samosas for $1 (tax included). Long line up but it moved quickly. Will definitely come back if I happen to be in the area. 
I like their samosas better than samosa king (in Scarborough)"}
