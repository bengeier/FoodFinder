{"text":"Great service everytime I come here, The food is also well above your average college hangout especially  when you think of how low the price is."}
{"text":"We thought the sushi was great especially all you can eat for 9 bucks"}
{"text":"The food has gone way down hill! The last time i went here, a week ago, the sushi was blan and over priced, and my \"kung pao shrimp\" that i asked for brown rice with, was served with fried rice, and my shrimp and minimal veges was served with SOY SAUCE covering it. Such a waste of money and time! It used to be a lot better."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible!!!!! Wasted my money so terrible l, sushi buffet was very bad obviously there was no sushi and server was bad"}
{"text":"Decent experience...good food...ordered the fried rice and liked it!! The serving and the ambience is pretty decent. It is pretty easy on your pocket and you can easily go for it for a filling!!"}
{"text":"Meh... Third place we stopped at yesterday. This is not a buffet place. Its an all you can eat sushi bar with a few hot items on the side for $8.75. Our first gut instinct was to walk out but we decided to stay for the experience and yelp review. Well, we've had better sushi at buffets but at least if the sushi isnt that good you have a selection of hot foods to choose from. For those looking for your bang for the buck we can understand, kinda, but those that think your getting good or real sushi are sadly mistaken. We were not suprised at what we found at an all you can eat bar... what would you expect? For those of you that like this kind of stuff... have at it. We will go where they make it fresh in front of you, not setting there waiting for you to try it."}
{"text":"The food is not as fresh as it could be. I have been here on several occasions because of the good price for the buffet, but it has raised twice since the last time I have been. I also don't like being stared at while I eat. On all of my occasions eating here I have been watched while eating and brought my check before I was ready. I almost felt like I was being rushed out. Definatley don't have to come back here especially since the prices have raised."}
{"text":"I like their hot pot, because the material is so fresh and the taste of soup is so so good"}
{"text":"As soon as you enter you are greeted with a friendly receptionist/ hostess that immediately gets your mind ready for a great experience! But once you step over to the Sushi bar the quality immediately drops. From the dried out rice, to the limited options of sushi selection. Maybe it is a different atmosphere and variety during the weekday but at 4:30pm on a Saturday it was a waste of money. 

On a positive nite a couple next to me order the hot pot and it look nice, wish I had order it!"}
{"text":"Great quality sushi in the buffet. Good bang for your buck, especially at the student discount! Try the phili sushi and top it off with a deep fried oreo."}
{"text":"If you LOVE sushi, the sushi buffet isn't that great...and neither is the food on the menu. You do get a lot of food for the price so no complaints there. The authentic food on their special menu tastes better."}
{"text":"I've learned to be especially wary of one star reviews, as they tend to reflect some sort of vindictiveness not generally based on the actual merits of a restaurant.  This, however, is a one star review based only on Bento's surprising ability to disappoint even the most meager of expectations.

My girlfriend and I went to Bento on a whim because it's very convenient to our place, and is cheap.  We figured that given the general rarity of bad Asian meals, and our low expectations based on Bento's prices, it'd easily be a worthwhile meal.

We were wrong.  

I was not expecting great sushi at Bento's $8.75 sushi buffet.  After all, sushi quality fish is expensive, and all you can eat is generally even more expensive (in my experience, nearly $20 at a different lunch buffet.)  Even with the expectation that fish was going to be scarce and rice plentiful, I found that Bento outdid themselves.  

I actually got some comedic value out of how artfully they slathered their rolls in dark sauces to obscure the fact that some of the rolls had no fish at all in them!  In fact, it was the \"Bento Special\" roll that I dissected, only to find there to be literally nothing but rice in its depths.  As an appreciator of comedy (and occasionally of art,) I have to tip my hat to Bento's \"chef\" for his masterful sushi tromp l'oeil!  

The other rolls were mostly just deep fried chicken wrapped around rice with a very, very small amount of what was presumably fish (pink solids.)  Their rendition of the venerable \"Philly Roll\" contained jalapenos, cream cheese, and nothing else.  Hmmmm.

My girlfriend was smarter, though not by a wide margin, and went with one of the \"Special\" Bento boxes.  Her General Tso's Tofu was edible, though certainly not moreso than a frozen Asian meal from the supermarket.

The last notable part of our meal was the bizarrely terrible ginger sauce, which we both tried.  Having never had anything but tasty ginger dressings at sushi restaurants, we were both unpleasantly surprised by just how bad this was.

Summary: If you know that you are getting yourself into some seriously low quality sushi and bento box fare, this might be just the spot for you.  If you, like me, would much rather have 6 fresh and tasty sushi rolls for a similar price, don't be suckered in by the \"all you can eat\" sign."}
{"text":"Only had sushi and the buffet

Sushi sucks! It's terrible. It's not as fresh but met the standard so you won't get sick. I'd rather get sick to lose the carbs because this wasn't worth it. 

California Roll is full of rice inside and out. Too much! As well as foo many cucumber slices. 

Salmon Roll is made a little backwards. Rice in and seaweed out. No seaweed in wrapped around another day's worth of rice. Jesus! So gross. 

Eel I asked for nigiri and I got sushi. She said that's the only way they make it. Come on! I can't taste the eel like that! 

No Kikkoman soy sauce?! Ok now they're KILLING ME!!! Kikkoman is the only way to go. Not these watered down soy sauce packets. Or should I call them brown water packets? Makes better sense. 

If you order to go you might wanna ask for napkins. You won't get any of that ever. 

Lunch buffet has a lot of variety but again the sushi is full of rice and tasteless. But the right soy sauce is on the table. That's good! 

The Chinese food for the buffet is decent but nothing super exciting that stands out. 

If you're a sushi connoisseur like myself, DO NOT try the sushi. Try the hot pot instead. Trust me!"}
{"text":"They changed the chef again. And this time, it is great. The spicy boiled fish is the best in the area. Recommend to anyone who loves spicy food."}
{"text":"Sever so slow i have one time eat hot pot and they make me way 1h in a table and just drinks water to way make me fill bad. And in this place not busy at all ang i dont know why they taje so long like that bad sevice."}
{"text":"Great food at a very reasonable price.  And a 10% discount with a UNCC I.D.  My Bento serves meals on a Bento style tray, with a choice of meat (or tofu) , rice, soup or salad, small slice of cake all for around $8.00.  They also have entrees like a spicy beef soup, other noodle or soup entrees, etc.  Very reasonable and fast service.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Used to be great but now it is really lame ever since they changed the chef. 
They change the style from Chinese to  Thai, which end up not being good at either type of the food. 

The service is fine. But I won't go anymore."}
{"text":"I used to think this place was okay until I tried the hot pot and the sauce they brought me seemed old and re-used and same with the meat! The hot pot machine was very dirty! I couldn't confirm this suspicion until the table next to us who also had a hot pot left, the waitress cleaning the table wiped all the used stuff off the table or dumped it into the pot but everything unused or whatever hadn't been mixed with other sauces was gently placed on platters and taken to the back instead of the usual side of register dirty dish designated area (this proves they re-use food someone needs to do a pop up inspection of the place!)"}
{"text":"Had the hot pot here the day before yesterday by myself and yesterday with friends. Food was great, and service was prompt. The hot pot is a popular form in China, and theirs is all you can eat style. We had clams fish shrimp beef lamb fish-balls and a bunch of vegetables, all of them very fresh. The soup is awesome, and you can blend your own favorite sauce. Lovely place to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"This place has an all you can eat buffet, for only 8.75. Basiclally you get what you pay for. The sushi was by for not the best of charlotte, however it wasnt bad either. If your strapped for cash it's worth eating here. Servers are nice. Atmosphere is nice also. We have been back numerous times."}
{"text":"this is awesome place. i love all your food and the chilly fish is the best. i eat here every weekend.  as for robert mady calling you guys alright is just plain stupid.robert mady must have been a really insane when he write all his reviews on yelp.
 one cannot help but wonder if he is a real moron in life or person with no soul or no moral.seriously robert mady look at your self before you criticize another restaurant with your stupidity.
 robert mady you look like a fat pig who stuff himself with food to fill the emptiness of your soul. robert mady if you like to eat so much why dont you give some your food to another person with no food or homeless or child in third world country who die of hunger instead of stuffing your self with food and then go on yelp and yapping about how it not good enough for you. seriously maybe then robert mady you will loose some weight because right now you look like perfect picture of gluttony.
rOBERT MADY  BE PART OF THE SOLUTION NOT JUST ANOTHER YAPPING COMPLAINER.  IF YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE BETTER FOOOD THAN BENTO THEN WE LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY.  qUITE FRANKLY WE DONT THINK YOU CAN AND YOUR YAPPING COMMENT ONLY SHOW THAT YOU ARE JUST ANOTHER NOoSY IDIOT WHO LIKE TO JAB HIS DICKS WHERE IT DOES NOT BELONG.  IN FACT YOU ARE LIKE THE VERBAL 'RAPPIST' OF OF THE STROLL SIDE OF YELP. fOR GOD SAKE AND THE HUMANITY OF MANDKIND PLEASE BE A BETTER PERSON. GROW A CONSCIENCE HAVE A SOUL SHOW THAT YOU CARE. bY GOING ON YELP AND COMPLAIN about ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER of all the restaurant you visit is not goin solve the problem.  everybody in life or business have their own problem that they can not solve.  If you cant help them solve the problem then there is no point of going on yelp and complain or spread bad gossip about  any business or restaurant.  Seriously dude grow up be a good man.  
or is it  because you cant solve the problem in your own life so that why go online and yelp to create more problem for other people? do you not know what you done is a kind of sin? May god help you become a better soul and be at peace with yourself and the world."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but food wasn't very fresh. I kinda felt sick afterward...but it was a lot of choices...and good if you just want taste and not quality."}
{"text":"I feel sad writing this review because I expected to be blown away when I came into Bento today. The last time I was there was about 1.5 years ago, and tried the \"real\" Chinese food they had back then. I felt like I got a little taste of my second home. Today I was around the area and actually called my friends over to Bento to try authentic Chinese food for the first time. 

First of all they don't have the separate chinese menu anymore, now it's incorporated into the other menu. I just knew it's not the same. And it wasn't. Everything is Americanized now, even the food that was supposed to be authentic. I had chili boiled fish, mapo toufu and pepper chicken and they all tasted different than the last time I went. 

Such a disappointment! Probably not coming back."}
{"text":"I got a Veg Lo Mein, which was good in taste, although a little oily. They added a free sweet ice tea, which was good. Moderately well priced although I believe quantity could have been more. Might go there again !!"}
{"text":"Love love the hot pot!!!! Great price! I don't care to much for the buffet. I had the buffet once and I wish they would switch it up. As for the sushi, all I got to say is that there are other places that has better sushi but it's decent. I highly recommend the hot pot!"}
{"text":"It sucks to have to write this review since the people there were so nice. We went for the hot pot. Everyone that loves hot pot knows that it's the broth & the sauces that make it so good. At this place, the broth was good. Too bad they have the worst sauces. I was looking for a good peanut sauce. They didn't have any. They had a sesame sauce which was more like a paste & it was awful! I tried mixing all the sauces together to create a good sauce but it was a major fail. I even added shrimp sauce to it for a little sweetness. Just NO. Also, the taro was dark & when we boiled it, parts were inedible. The service was decent but it was obvious they don't get many hot pot customers. No napkins & had to repeatedly ask for more water. The good news is that they have a great variety of foods & they don't skimp on it. I think I would go back but I'll bring my own sauce. I wish I could rate this higher."}
{"text":"I'm going to pay for this later :)  

I was greatly surprised by Bento's. This is a very good restaurant and family friendly.

All you can eat sushi... and about 25 different kinds.  I especially liked the Spicy Tuna and Crab & Cream Cheese roll.  Attentive service, greatly priced- family of 4 ate dinner for under $40.  Weakness would be the fried rice, a little more oil than I prefer.  Would eat here again.  I am so full..."}
{"text":"This place has a good lunch special and what looks to be a good buffet.  I have not tried the buffet, but I've tried several of their lunch specials, which are a great value at $6.25 for chicken (steak or shrimp are a little more) with rice and soup.  You get to choose the way you want your meat made (the sauce and veggies, that is) and they offer white, brown or fried rice with it, as well as a choice of soups.  It also comes with a spring roll.  For under $7 with tax, I find it to be a great value, since I always get two meals out of it, at least.

It's pretty Americanized food, which is probably good for most people.  They do also have a Chinese menu that has many more traditional/authentic dishes on it.  I've been there on a weekend for lunch and have seen several Asian families who ordered from the Chinese menu and had several family style dishes they all shared, so this menu is very different from their standard one, but I want to try it soon.

They have an all you can eat buffet 7 days a week for $8.95 and it includes several types of sushi.  I have seen it every time I've been in the place, but I have not tried it yet, so I can't really comment on it.

For the money, if you want decent Asian food in University area, I would definitely give it a thumbs up."}
{"text":"$20 for AYCE hot pot! Can't beat that! Everything was good especially the spicy broth we got. The only down side is that most of the meat, seafood, tofu, & udon noodles were frozen, not fresh. Service was great, will definitely be back. We might try their AYCE sushi next time!"}
{"text":"Buffet was mediocre. They have someone behind the counter making fresh rolls. We tried requesting a tuna roll since the variety they were making was odd and not that appetizing and they tried charging us for it."}
{"text":"I'm an avid Chinese food guy, but this place is alright.  The Buffet is alright, but the real hidden jewel is the hot pot.  It's $20 a person and amazing!"}
{"text":"The food in this restaurant is pretty decent. my car got hit out in the parking lot so it's not really the best for your vehicle however the food is good and the atmosphere is pretty simple. The service is nice and they only come around once in a while but it is so frequent enough that it is acceptable. The meal portions are okay for the price. there's just nothing special about this restaurant though."}
{"text":"Lots of Yelpers seem to be talking about the sushi buffet at MBAD, and I'm sure it's good, but i can't testify. What I can rave about is their signature bento combos. Delicious and cheap? I'm in!

You get your choice of protein, and of starch as well as soup or salad and a baby egg roll. Me, I'm a huge fan of the tofu (which is usually not my fav) and veggies in Kung Pao sauce w/ brown rice and salad w/ ginger dressing.

Do you see how much food that is? Cost? $6.75. I split it over two days bringing my lunch costs to under three fifty. 

The staff is always friendly and my takeout always comes out quickly. If I had to voice one complaint it is that the salad is about 98% iceburg lettuce and 2% tomato,cucumber & carrot, but honestly, it all ends up tasting like ginger dressing (though you can get ranch if you like) and it lasts overnight in my work fridge, so I'm not griping.

My Bento Asian Diner is a quality spot to pick up legit food for lunch. It has vegetables in it even! And don't forget to ring the gong by the door if you are happy with your experience."}
{"text":"I won't say it's an excellent hot pot place but I was so happy when I finally ate the lamb and the hot pot sauce before Chinese New Year!"}
{"text":"Tried the buffet but it actually didn't have much to it. There was more sushi options than most actual buffets, but the thing was it wasn't fresh (and by that, they've been on the plate for a longgg time) and most of the plates were empty. I asked the woman to make some more though and she kindly did. Everything else besides the sushi was two soups and a few other items. For the price, you could go to a regular buffet for better variety. 

As for the hot pot, the broths are really good in my opinion. It's just the items that go with it. For example, the crab has that frozen aftertaste when it's been kept up for a long time. I'd avoid it. Veggies are good though, and you get to get more of anything you want for $20 bucks a person."}
{"text":"Last time I ate here was back in 2013 I guess before the Chef changed. When I ate here this was the best place. I got a hearty portion of my favorite creation which is garlic or sesame chicken (or shrimp depending on my mood) bento with fried rice and a spring roll. Me and my boyfriend came here so much that the waitress knew us by name and always talked to us when we came. 

My boyfriend loves the buffet and for that price I wouldn't blame him. I wish they had something like this in Phoenix. I will be back next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The staff member forgot to write the order down correctly. I got my first dish but patiently waited for the 2nd. It never came. I inquired how long it would take and they forgot to order it.

This happened a 2nd time.

Then they brought out the wrong orders. They don't understand english very well, and they were very rude and refused to go back and get us the correct orders. Very hostile staff 

Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to eat here twice a week or at least once a week. It's really good American sushi most of it is cooked. The employees are really friendly. My husband quit eating here because everytime we come here theres not a lot of sushi left on the buffet and you can tell when it's not fresh. I come here occasionally by myself. But I think today is my last time. My favorite sushi is not even on the buffet today. And it's not even the first time. Can't say anything about the menu always get the buffet."}
{"text":"I can here on a whim wanting some sushi and I saw they had sushi buffet. While there are a variety of choices there are only a couple that have any good taste to them. Most of the staff doesn't speak English (which doesn't bother me but I can see where it could cause problems). My waitress was fairly attentive and could answer any questions I had. The quality wasn't great and I will probably not return."}
{"text":"First time here. The sushi was ok. I've eaten elsewhere for better quality sushi for the same price and more varieties of food on the bar. Will go back just to test out the hot pot only. Need more servers."}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me to check this place out because they sell bubble tea.  So, I went out of my way one day to pick up some food and a bubble tea -- even though I wasn't hungry.  Their menu was very extensive with a mixture of japanese and chinese -- you know, all the typical dishes you'd expect.  I ordered a hibachi chicken with a milk tea bubble tea!  While I waited for my to-go order I checked out the buffet. It offered sushi rolls, rice, soup (egg drop, I think) crag rangoons, egg rolls, etc.  Even though the buffet did not entice me, I was looking forward to my meal.  The bubble tea was very good but a little too watered down.  The ice had obviously melted too much.  The pearls were pretty decent.  Definitely some of the best that I've found in Charlotte (although, that's not saying that much).  I took my meal home and enjoyed it.  The chicked wasn't cut hibachi-style -- the cubes do make a difference.  But, the flavor was good.  However, later that night, I did not feel very well.  I'm not sure what it was about that chicken and rice, but something really upset my stomach.  So, I'm giving this place 3 stars because of the bubble tea.  I probably will not eat here again but if I'm in the area, I'll stop in for some bubble tea.  I recommend this place for those with strong stomachs."}
{"text":"The customer service was horrible, ignores. They have very few options on their buffet side. Most of the time the sushi are emptied. Don't go at night when they will stop making food."}
{"text":"$10 sushi buffet! What! 
I gave it 3 because the decor and set up was kinda wack but the rolls were good & unique fusing some chinese dishes into their rolls. I recommend"}
{"text":"Came here to try the hot pot for the first time. The quantity of food they give is awesome! It was so much we couldn't finish . The broth was a lil bland.. but it wasn't hard to fix with a lil bit of sauce here and there . I would def come back again"}
{"text":"I usually order sushi for take out, here. It's made fresh, well-made, and reasonably priced. However, the large menu selection always intrigued me. They have things from noodle bowls, to hot pot, to hibachi, to sushi, to curry -- and other Chinese dishes. 

Today I had the fried Gyoza staters and as an entré, the yellow curry chicken (which was denoted as being spicy). The curry was creamy and tasted just right, although, I expected a little more spiciness. It has a good amount of potatoes and sautéed onions, but not too much, and a generous amount of chicken, all in a very large portion (too much for me to eat all of it).

I went with my mother, who ordered sesame chicken. She gave me a taste. While it was sweet and a little crunchy, they really skimped out on the sesame seeds. It was otherwise pretty tasty.

The atmosphere is not understated (good) and comfortable. You have booths and tables at which to sit, and a few are set up to seat larger parties. There's an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet at the entrance, where the sushi chef does his/her art. 

Overall, I was quite satisfied with this cozy, little restaurant. I definitely will recommend it to someone looking for Chinese food, or something asian. I hear the hot pot is great, and (at about $20/person) one day, I do look forward to trying that."}
{"text":"So, we thought that this place would excel in the making of bento boxes. They DONT offer bento boxes. We stayed anyways to give it a try.  We opted for the buffet because we wanted sushi. The sushi was GREAT. They also had lo mein, sesame chicken, broccoli with chicken, fried rice, crab ragoons, and sweet donuts. And soup. It was a great price overall. Especially with a UNCC student discount! I will go back when I am in the mood for sushi again, but it looks like I'm still on the quest for a good bento box!"}
{"text":"My son & I went there this afternoon.  Very disappointed for $10 all you can eat.  There was nothing to eat.  I would say 10 trays empty the other trays had 4-6 pieces.  The hot food was dried out.  We went around 430pm.  It totally explained why we were the only ones there.  I not interested in going back at all."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK if you want an inexpensive all you can eat meal.  There is a variety of sushi (mostly fried and made of A LOT of rice) as well as a few hot items.  There's also some desserts- Chinese donuts and fried Oreos.  

This is located right across from the college so it appeals to the college crowd.  The price is just under $10 per person.  They also have a full menu that you can order from, but I have never tried ordering from. It.  The popular menu items seems to be the \"hot pot.\"  I have noticed people eating that and and also ordering large portions to share among many people, versus ordering their own.  

If you're looking for an inexpensive all you can eat sushi- and don't expect a lot- try this out.  If you want something fancy, this isn't the spot."}
{"text":"I stopped by after looking for a fair priced Asian restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised. The service was quick and friendly. I ordered Miso soup and Mongolian chicken. They were both delicious! I can't wait to try the sushi!"}
{"text":"As an American-Chinese guy, I need to say that Bento is the closest the University Area will get to authentic Chinese food.  All of the silly Americans looking for that Kung Pao or General Tso garbage will still get what they're looking for.  The chef is able to cook up various authentic dishes.  Just go to the restaurant and look at what another Chinese person is eating.  Don't worry, you won't get any dog or cat meat and you can still get your little fortune cookies."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing... Ate there today, and I am a big fan. They have their signature \"fried chicken roll\" and bagel roll which I loved!!!!!  Sushi Heaven..."}
{"text":"They had a sushi buffet, which included crab Rangoon. We ordered crab Rangoon (not buffet) and when they came out they were cold. I asked the waitress if they should be cold and she said no hot. Told her how cold they were and her response was, \"that's probably because they have been sitting out for so long.\" Our food was ok- not horrible, but I've had much better. We snacked on the crab and as I took a bite out of the last one, I got a long piece of blonde hair. We will not go back."}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered spicy chicken and it tasted great. The staff are friendly and explained the menu well. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I've visited China twice now and have an appreciation for the cuisine but it's near impossible to get the authentic flavors in Charlotte.

Confession: I wrote off Bento a while ago because their food did nothing for me, the buffet left little to be desired, and I each time I left underwhelmed.

And then a friend took me there for lunch and introduced me to their \"secret\" Chinese menu and I was converted! I've been back several times with my husband to explore as much of the authentic menu as possible and it's to the point where we get sat in the back of the restaurant, with the rest of the natives. Makes me feel like I'm back in Suzhou! 

Our favorites off the secret menu are:

- Spicy Beef (cooked with jalapenos, so good!)
- Steamed bass (without the sauce) served on broccoli
- Garlic Bok Choy

They also have hot pot available but we haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"My son and I used to go here all the time for the sushi buffet, it was \"our\" special restaurant. No culinary miracles here, just the sushi bar with goodish sushi and a great price. My son and I went here a few days ago and learned that the sushi bar was GONE, now they focus on ridiculously over priced bento boxes that were just \"meh\".  Service was S L O W and we left mightily disappointed. All the wait staff were different so I'm assuming new owners, and so I say to the new regime at my bento \"bring back the old menu!\" My son and I wont be back and I  don't think I'm being presumptuous to say that many other former regulars won't be either... :("}
{"text":"Well, I'm glad we tried the noodle dishes first and not the sushi bar, because we probably wouldn't have gone back based on the sushi.  Lots of fried rolls (one of which inspired the comment \"this is not sushi, this is a DONUT, I'm pretty sure that sauce is Duncan Hines frosting\").  But, the steamed pork dumplings were still delicious, reminding me what I liked about the place last week.  I'm keeping it at a 4 until we go back to score the bento."}
{"text":"Holy Moly! All you can eat SUSHI??? This was the best yelp suggestion we have ever taken. We will most definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I went just for the hot pot. For about $20/person it was well worth it. They have a checklist where you can pick which veggies, meat, or seafood you would like. The best part is you can eat as much as you'd like. No skimping here, they are not stingy with the selections like most other hot pot places! Which is a good thing for a fatty like me. Our waitress was sweet and very attentive making sure we always had enough food. One person in our group did not have hot pot but rather the chicken basil which was a large portion size for under $10! She had to save half for lunch. I had a bite and I'd say it was decent, I just prefer more basil but it's personal preference. All in all, I will be back soon. Good value for the prices."}
{"text":"I like their hibachi chicken bento lunches. The sushi is decent as well."}
{"text":"The hot pot here is sooooo good and soooo fresh! My fav spot to go to on a rainy day! Such a perfect hidden gem, I can't believe no one told me earlier because hands down best hot pot in town. The servers were so nice too! We got the clear and spicy broth and they were both delish and flavorful!"}
{"text":"I always order a togo with them I haven't have the time to dine in with them yet. Their Chinese dishes are great I love the water spinach is my all time favorite and the servicer is nice."}
{"text":"Used to come to bento all the time and loved it. They have new management and the food has gone down hill. The sushi buffet at 8pm was empty with minimal subpar, old, fried sushi. Parts of the salmon were dark brown/black and he avocado was brown. We eat sushi all over the area and this was a horrible experience. Will not be returning. Waited over 35 minutes for food and the server came back and asked what I had ordered, so I left. The manager didn't show up, or so we were told."}
{"text":"Bento is definitely a unique place from what I've seen for sushi in the past. I never could've imagined an actual sushi buffet with such interesting creations.

Setup here isn't bad either; it doesn't have that gaudy cliche Chinese buffet atmosphere. They cycle the music through a bunch of different East Asian pop and stuff that I like. The buffet is the way to go here with the college students. It's a good price and you can get a UNCC student discount on an already decently priced buffet.

I have had an actual bento box here too and it's surprisingly quite filling. They throw a lot more into it than what a typical Japanese bento would hold. I'm still a sucker for the various panko breaded deep fried rolls on the sushi bar - love 'em!"}
{"text":"Restaurant beside a Harris Teeter. Not very busy on a Saturday night. They actually have a good amount of space inside. This review is only for the hotpot. It's about $20 per person. You can get chicken soup base, spicy soup base or half of each. The chicken soup base tastes like chicken soup, which is pretty good. The spicy soup base is not bad as well, but not really all that spicy. There is a decent selection of items you can cook in the hotpot, with the pork, beef, lamb meat and fish, shrimp, beef and fish balls... the usual hot pot ingredients are there. Supposedly you can get blue crab, but they ran out when we went. It's all you can eat, so if you can eat a lot, it's a pretty decent deal. 

As for the rest of the menu, I haven't tasted it. My friends who have been doesn't think highly of the sushi and menu items, but agrees that the hot pot is good."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner.  The first thing indicating a level of sketchiness is a sushi buffet at what is clearly a Chinese restaurant in most other respects.  But the weirdness of this sort continued...I ordered a \"bento\" of honey sesame chicken.  It was basically identical to the same dish at just about every other non-authentic Chinese restaurant, but served in a Japanese bento box for no apparent reason...and with miso soup...which doesn't match the flavor at all.  It's not pan-asian in the usual \"fusion\" way...it's just a collection of dishes, some Chinese and some Japanese, thrown together without any pattern or plan.

The service was great, and food was not particularly bad or good, the music was blah pop, and the decoration sparse.  It's a place to fill your belly, but the prices are not particularly reasonable considering this whole picture.  I wouldn't necessarily avoid this place in the future, but I can imagine that if I lived around the corner I still may never come back either.  

If I want Chinese then I'd go to a Chinese restaurant, and if I want Japanese I'll go to a Japanese restaurant.  It's not often that I'm in the mood for a Japanese appetizer and then a Chinese meal with a Japanese drink.  It just doesn't go together."}
{"text":"For the price, it's good sushi. It's a 11 dollar sushi bar so I wouldn't expect it I be that great but its pretty decent. My favorite rolls to get are the spicy crab and spicy tuna. One of the biggest bothers is the largeness of the rolls sometimes they were a bit too much for a single bite.  When you get the sushi bar your not just restricted to sushi, they include a small array of Chinese food of sesame chicken, soups, crab Rangoon and other assorted foods that are not anything special.

Service is pretty good, I enjoyed the waitress's, one of the waitress brought  batch of sweet tea for us because we found the initial serving under sweet.  Not to mention they seem pretty friendly and open to conversation. The place isn't that big, so it gets busy really quickly especially around dinner.

 Overall a pretty decent place with great priced sushi, if your feeling cheap then try this place I'm sure you won't be disappointed by the sushi for the price your getting.."}
{"text":"This place must be on everyone's list for cheap eats.  It's a sushi buffet with some random chinese thrown in on the side (for those of us that are indecisive) and all for $8.75! They always have lo mein, fried rice miso soup chinese donuts, egg rolls, and crab rangoon and then mix it up with the two meat dishes.  In the other section of the buffet they have all of your sushi favorties: california roll, spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, philly roll, crab roll and then they have their signature roll and whatever special rolls the chef is inclined to make that day.  For lunch the $8.75 includes the iced tea but no drink is included in the $8.75 for dinner AND they have recently added a 10% off discount with UNCC ID."}
{"text":"This time, we ate in, rather than taking out. Great flavor, fresh ingredients, and attentive service. I love Asian food, and I really like good service.

My wife and I had Bento boxes. She had tofu and veggies, and I had steak and veggies. The boxes came with spring rolls, pineapple, rice, salad or soup, and the main stir-fry dish.

My son had Singapore rice noodles with chicken, broccoli, and other veggies. He was stuffed, but had green tea ice cream for dessert. Loved it. And he's our *picky eater.* 

Heck yeah, I'm a fan. This place is inexpensive and healthy and the service is just right. We'll be back to try the all-you-can-eat for less than $8 sushi bar!"}
{"text":"The only Taiwanese hotpot place in Charlotte! Great price great food. Gotta try it if you have never experience hotpot."}
{"text":"Everything was rather mediocre. I opted in for the buffet. There are a handful of kitchen items and probably 25 different sushi. Everything was lukewarm and you could tell the sushi had been sitting out for a while. Staff was very friendly and quick to refill drinks and what not.  Not the best sushi, but for nine dollars I guess you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my go-to locales near campus. But after just going back for the first time in a year or so, I can no longer recommend it given the other options in the area. Until last October, 2017, they had a great all-you-can-eat sushi bar for a decent price. After planning a trip across town to visit family here, I didn't find out this had been discontinued until I was getting ready to order, because the \"All You Can Eat\" sign is still outside, just with a piece of paper hastily slapped on the sign over part of it. This was really the only thing that set it apart from the myriad of other places nearby. If you already have a favorite dish there, awesome. But if you're considering trying something new and you see Bento, just look at the other places within a mile or so (Ishi, Kabuto, Love Sushi, House of Leng, etc) and you're bound to find what you're looking for, and made better than here. Way to cancel the only thing that made you guys different. Congrats."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the University area.  My wife and I take our young grandsons here a lot.  The service is great - kid-friendly, helpful staff.  Nice, casual space.  Very good selection at the buffet - I love their noodles - and the menu has a lot of great choices."}
{"text":"I was excited to see that they had Taiwanese dishes only to be extremely disappointed. The shredded pork and garlic sauce was okay it tasted like someone soaked the tofu in tap water for too long though. The black pepper steak was absolutely horrible. The \"steak\" tasted like leftover dried up meat from a week ago. I'm not even sure what kind of meat it was to be quite honest. Will not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This review is for the sushi buffet. We had previously been here about 4 times and on this last visit we where expecting a positive experience such as our previous visits. What a DISAPPOINTMENT!!! Im so sad I'm leaving this comment because I really like bentos but our last visit really sucked. The service from our waitress was good, but the sushi options where tragic. Seems like the guy who was making them had called it a day. Mind you, it was around 6 in the evening. DINNER TIME!!! The shrimp sauce was so watered down I had never seen anything like it. WTF!? I'm afraid I won't be coming here any time soon. Get it together Bentos."}
{"text":"(Here is my review from Trip Advisor, review still stands.)

Place is small and cozy. My GF and I had the \"sushi\" buffet. Most were rolled maki sushi that contained little or no real fish. I do not count krab stix as fish by the way. All of the rolls contained a combination of one or more of the following; fake krab stick, cream cheese, small diced shirmp, tempura flakes, cucumber, small salmon sliver, cooked chicken. There were a few nigiri peices but the fish was so small I skipped it. Most of the maki rolls were slathered in some sort of sauce; coconut, sweet glaze, chili mayo, etc. hiding the lack of authentic sushi contents (fish / avocado / etc).

The boba teas were good, also the lo mein was decent on the buffet. The miso soup was bland and tasted like a wet dog smells, kinda musty and metallic-ish.

I've heard the actual menu items are decent, I may give that one more try later on."}
{"text":"Try the chilled jellyfish. It's on a list of special appetizers on the back of the menu.  We tried it on a lark and it was our favorite dish. It was tossed in sesame oil and tasted great when dipped in soy sauce.  Strangely, it's texture was crunchy - kind of like pickled cabbage.

The pan-Asian menu will please lots of Americans.  My daughter had a hibachi bento box, which was fine. She also ordered miso soup which was horrible. I had a noodle soup which was fine once doctored up with a little soy sauce and sriracha."}
{"text":"I always had the buffet. Great deal of variety in Sushi. 
Soup:
There are crunchies which go really well with the soup. 
Main Course:
One or two vegetable options and if you ask them they make them for you. ( really appreciated this)
Deserts:
Swiss Rolls and many different types of sauce (caramel, chocolate, strawberry)"}
{"text":"Your typical Chinese American food. Nothing special, prices are reasonable, and food is mediocre. The curry does taste odd so maybe don't order soup based dishes."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!! It was fairly empty when we walked in on a Friday night but service was great! Top notch service!! We got the hot pot all you can eat that includes the sushi buffet. Sushi was disappointing only because the place was empty so the sushi had been sitting around a little. It was out in room temp condition with no ice or cooler. The main event though was the Hot Pot!! They had alllll the sauces you need on the menu. We were new but the waitress was so nice she was fine with us getting all the sauces. We got beef, lamb, clams, squid, fishballs (fried and filled), oyster mushroom, bokchoy and rice noodles. We got the spicy broth. The broth was a little bland. It was completely overfilled with chili, chili oil, and herbs but it still lacked flavor and wasn't spicy. If you drank the broth it actually tasted a bit bitter. Unsure if it was the herb mix or if the chili was burnt/overcooked before they dumped it in. Nonetheless, we enjoyed it and had a great time. We'll def be back but will probably try the clear broth and see how that goes. I should note that although the broth wasn't spicy to my taste, the next morning my stomach was in pain from all the chili oil that coated my stomach. Clear broth next time lol."}
{"text":"Well, we tried the hot pot and it is really bad except  fried taro. The fried taro is really good.  Other than that, nothing really stands out.

In general, the vegetables are better than the meat. The meat is too lean and sliced in a chaotic manner, and you could hardly differentiate the beef and lamb. If you love the meat of hot pot, don't come here. Don't. 

Second of all, the sauce are horrible, horrible, not kidding. I never saw the sesame sauce is so thick that I have to add water to it myself and make it right. However, it is not the authentic sesame sauce, which ruins the experience. OMG, worst sauce you could get ever. 

Also, the choices of vegies, meats, and sauces are really limited. 

Final word, NOT recommend AT ALL, at least NOT hot pot."}
{"text":"This place was quite delicious. My girlfriend and I went for the sushi buffet. Each one was as tasty as it was unique. The staff was amazing as well. We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Place must be under new management or something and they obviously are not very bright.  Tried to order a bento for my daughter as I have in the past, but was told they no longer serve bentos, rather rudely too.  Maybe they should have changed the name from My Bento to \"No Bento\".  Sushi bar looked rather ghetto and food looked like it had been sitting out for a long time.  Went to go get a real meal elsewhere.  Too bad; used to be a nice place to take the family."}
{"text":"This place is located close to campus and I was introduced to it by other students. Whenever we go, we always get the buffet. The buffet offers soup and some Chinese options such as lo mein, fried rice, crab rangoon, egg rolls, chicken and broccoli, and general tso's/sesame chicken. The rest of the buffet is sushi. The sushi is not anything special. If you are a sushi snob, this is probably not the place for you. If you craving sushi and want all you can eat for the price of a single roll at other restaurants this is the place for you. Most of the rolls are spicy tuna, spicy shrimp, crab, some salmon, many of them have cream cheese... some are deep fried... most of them of covered in spicy mayo or some other sauce. 

They also have Chinese donuts and deep fried Oreos. The only complaint I would have is that the Chinese donuts end up becoming hard from sitting in the warming tray for too long. 

The staff is pretty friendly and attentive to your needs. For the price and convenience of being close to campus for a quick lunch trip, this place is a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. Hot pot and Chinese food is the best in town. Everything is affordable here and convenient to students! The waitresses are friendly and they will make your dining experience there wonderful!"}
