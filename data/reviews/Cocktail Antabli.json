{"text":"The only reason why this place deserves 3 stars is because their fruit cocktails are delicious. Service is terrible. The register lady is extremely unprofessional and makes rude remarks to colleagues about customers."}
{"text":"I love their products, it is just so good, refreshing, always nice to grab something from Antabli, especially at night when most of the stores are close"}
{"text":"Great selection of deserts that will not disappoint anyone. The ice cream with the fruit salad is really tasty. Chocolate crebs are  amazing. One thing I didn't like that all the workers they use their bare hands, no gloves, to pick or cut the fruit. I should've screamed foul. They only take cash. It's time to join the 21st century and get a debit machine. Come on, who carry cash anymore."}
{"text":"Horrible service and overpriced. Very disappointed with the Côte vertu location. Arrived and ordered la Milles et une nuit with the Tahiti, fruits where scarce, barely any achta. Forgot to even sprinkle the crushed pistachio.... And the arrogance of the staff..... Wow! My guests all ordered the sirene dish, 4 of them, not 1 but 4!! After waiting over 20 mins to get our plates.... The manager didn't even have the courtesy to bring our food to the table after we had paid and tipped them. She had the nerve to raise her voice and make us get off our table and get our food. 

Very very unimpressed with the level of courtesy this establishment hires let alone enforce. Will never step foot in this franchise ever again nor will I ever bring out of town guests here again. 


Mrs Merhi, you should drop in your franchises more often and see for yourself. This is disappointing."}
{"text":"Very good and original desserts.

You have tons of choices combining, crepes, waffles, ice creams and gelatos, fruits, sauces of all sorts and  other toppings.

The decor is very colourful and upbeat. Lots of place to sit and enjoy your guilty pleasure.

Find the music a bit too loud though. Hard to hear each other. Then again, hard to talk with your mouth full of ice cream , strawberries and whip cream :).

A really fun place for desserts."}
{"text":"I tried it yesterday upon recommendation of some friends, it was a quiet disappoint for me! I ordered 2 things, one salty and one sweet.

- Very slow service, you stand in the line to order, wait in the cash line to pay, wait again to take your order and hoping no one else will mix his/her order with yours. I waited approx 25 minutes to take 2 things!!!
- Quiet pricy comparing to what you get.
- Quality of food is ok, but not as I expected.
- Staff are not trained enough nor quick enough.

In the end, it's good to try, but for me that's it."}
{"text":"Quite tasty though in lebanon u can find tastier ones.
Bit pricy I felt.."}
{"text":"Been coming here for close to 20 years. Their cocktail Antabli has been reasonably consistent, but their service has declined considerably. During our latest experience, we asked for the ghishta to be put on the side because we wanted to keep it for later. The owner simply said no, they don't do that, but that has never been a problem in the past! She offered no explanation, and was generally rather rude. Whenever we come to Quebec from Toronto we stop here, but after this experience we won't be back."}
{"text":"Les desserts sont délicieux!! Ils ont une grande variété de saveur. Les employés sont super patients  et amicals. J'adore aussi la deco!"}
{"text":"This is the worst dessert place i've been to. I dont know if this place has something against girls or what??? The service is absolutely horrible. My girl friend and I came here for desserts with some guy friends. Only us girls wanted some dessert, but we were all in line to order since we were all together. The guy at the counter asked the guys if they wanted anything. They said no and I told him I wanted to order. He then just plainly ignored me and my girl friend and moved on to the next customers. After a while, a girl staff came and took our order. My guy friends sat down. The food was ready and my girl friend and I were in line to pay. We were the first in line at the cash register, but the guy plainly ignored us again when we were standing RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM and went on to serve some other customers (guys) after us. I got a bit pissed and clearly told him I just wanted to pay. He then just took my money out of my hand without saying a word, gave me back my change, didn't even look at me and then served some other guys behind us. Are we invisible or what? 

The food was just ok. You can't really go wrong with ice cream, nutella and waffle...

The tables were sticky and nobody cleans it. We just wanted to leave so badly. 

I would never ever set foot in this place again!"}
{"text":"All hail the Lebanese cocktails. This place is wonderful, as soon as you walk in you smell the fruit.  It is by no means fancy, and they only take cash(there is an ATM no worries folks) but you will not be disappointed. I definitely recommend getting any cocktail with extra Ashta(the creamy sweet cheese that they plop on top of each drink) but the \"Antabli cocktail\" is my favourite. The crêpes are massive but oh so wonderful so either be prepared to share or go in hungry! It is always busy, service is fast and pleasant, and the fruit is fresh.  Great place to try by yourself or with a group, seating is inside and outside!  There is a large selection of ice cream/gelato, but I have yet to try it because I can't get enough of the Ashta (which by the way you can order by the kilo.. Rejoice!!).  Most definitely recommend this to any one who loves fruit, crepes, dessert, ice cream, or even to those who want \"cocktail hour\" but don't drink alcohol!"}
{"text":"Looking for a treat? You found the perfect location. Everything is made with love & fresh ingredients. My favourite is the Jamaican crepe!! Try their drinks too! It might get crowded on the weekends but they always make sure that you're in good hands! Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Having tried this Fruit cocktail while I was living in Beirut, made this shop a must stop for me while visiting Montreal for the weekend.
The fruits are fresh, the juice is a mix of strawberry and banana and avocado.
The cup is big.
That's one of the best desserts you could ever have.
I really wish they had a location in NYC."}
{"text":"I love this place, very fresh and with the best Ashta in town. My preferred place is the Nuit du Liban, if you like fruits, nutts and honey you will not be disappointed, it will be served on top of Ashta (a type of yogurt/ricota spread cheese)
Take a look on the picture...
Also they stay open very late, so if you are out until late and had a last minute craving for food, it is the place to go, healthy and supper fresh & tasty!
I'm regular costumer since many years"}
{"text":"This was my first dessert place since I moved to Montreal - very nice decor, fresh fruits, and huge menu- but they only take cash! Initially I was very impressed but after visiting other places of the same sort, I came to the conclusion that Antabli is able to improve in their service; they shouldnt take their customers for granted- we drove a long way to visit them. However, if I am in the area during summer time, i would probably stop for a cold dessert :)"}
{"text":"Need to satisfy your midnight sweet craving then head here!! They have fresh fruits and all kinds of desserts with crepes, waffles, frozen drinks, fresh juice. I've never had problems with staff. Fairly large space with options of sitting on high chairs, regular seats or booth. Part of the seating arrangements goes past the actual resto and into the building. I usually sit there because of the openness. It can get crowded and crammed in the evening. Service isn't the quickest but its acceptable. I've been here atleast 5 times in the past couple of years."}
{"text":"Parfait endroit si on a envie de se sucrer le bec et d'exagérer!  Sorbet, crème glacé, crêpe, fruits, lait frappé, specialités libanaises. En plus c'est ouvert tard le soir. Si vous n'êtes pas fan des pâtisseries et gâteaux: c'est l'option parfaite pour vous car y en a pas."}
{"text":"Drove all the way for achta ice cream and it was totally worth it. 4 stars instead of 5 because of service and price."}
{"text":"Big portions for crepes and the most filling drinks! However, you can only sample 3 flavours of ice cream at a time. The place is quiet with a vibrant interior. There's no description of their drinks or food, so you have to look at the pictures and inquire. The service isn't spectacular because there is just one person running the front. I highly recommend the Miami drink if you want something filling! It has mango cubes, mango juice, mistika ice cream, avocado slices, ashta cheese (very light and less savoury), topped with a honey drizzle and crushed pistachios! Their mushroom turkey crepe was simple. The sauce reminded me of Campbell's canned mushroom soup and the turkey was cold cut. However, its a good portion. Highly recommend the drinks!"}
