{"text":"5 Doors North is my neighbourhood spot. I have visited it on several occasions, and each time I leave, I debate whether sharing this place with the world is worth having to wait for a table during an already busy dinner rush. My conscience prevails, as 5 Doors North is too great of a restaurant not to review, and share with my fellow TOFoodReviews readers.

A spur of the moment, \"Thursday night out\" decision, led Andy and I to 5 Doors North, knowing we would get a great meal. We were seated in the front area of the dining room, perfect for people watching along the Eglinton-Davisville and Yonge street corridor. The furnishings are worn, kitschy, and mismatched, but only add to the warmth and charm of the restaurant.  The restaurant menu is hand-written and photocopied, followed by an evolving list of specials on the chalkboard, which are carefully selected, and always guaranteed to be great.

The wine list is small and filled with some robust reds. I ordered the Pinot Noir, which I have to say, just didn't do it for me, it was a bit thin and wasn't quite what I was hoping for. Andy's Malbec was fabulous, so we both ordered another glass for the second round. Wines by the glass are anywhere from $7 to $11, and bottles in the $30-$50 range. Overall, wines are priced fairly well, but I would love to see a little more variety to match the diverse food menu.

The appetizer list is long, and everything sounds incredible. They have smoked salmon, Prosciutto, mussels, a delicious polenta dish, on top of the list of daily specials, which included cauliflower soup, avocado bruschetta, and crab cakes. We went with the soup, beef Carpaccio with Pecorino cheese & roasted onion, and the beet salad. First out was the roasted beet salad with scallion aioli & lotus chips, which was wonderful, the goat cheese soft and warm, and the beets sweet and crunchy. The roasted cauliflower soup was smoky and creamy, but not too heavy; a perfect start to the meal, and the beef Carpaccio was some of the best, the cheese and onion offsetting the beef perfectly.

For our mains, I ordered the gnocchi Gorgonzola special and Andy the braised brisket ravioli. The meals were incredible. The gnocchi was awesome, fresh and soft, but the real winner was the Gorgonzola cream sauce. So creamy, it certainly blew my cheese calorie allotment for the week, but so worth it. Garnished with scallions and fresh pepper, the meal needed nothing more to bring out the strong flavours in the Gorgonzola.

The braised brisket ravioli was probably one of the more interesting meals we have ever had. I was unsure what to expect, but the beef was perfect, melt-in-your-mouth, wrapped in fresh pasta, with beef au jus and cream to make up the ravioli sauce. It would be worth phoning in advance to see if this was on the specials menu, as this dish just has to be tried.

The prices are right, entrées run from $14-$20, with appetizers in the $8-$12 range. The service is extremely friendly, with everyone pitching in to seat, serve and check-in. It's a family run restaurant, and you can tell by the attitudes and the recommendations of the staff that they all love the food at 5 Doors North as much as you will."}
{"text":"Well, I have to admit the food here is pretty great. We had the recommended ribs and pasta tonight. They were good. So did the avocado thingie. However, the cocktails were disappointing. They didn't taste good and were expensive"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal here. Shared a delicious risotto to start and then each had an entree. The BBQ baby back ribs did not disappoint. Delicious BBQ sauce, huge portion (I had to take a lot of it home). Husband's roast chicken was yummy - tender inside with a nice crispy, well-seasoned skin. Service was friendly and our server in particular was attentive and funny. My only negative is that wine-by-the-glass is the most expensive I've seen anywhere in a long time. Overall, though, a very nice dining experience!"}
{"text":"This place is really fabulous!  We went here over the holidays and were very impressed.  It's casual but the food is outstanding.  We shared mushroom risotto with truffle oil, and gnocchi.  Both dishes were great (fyi the lunch size is enough food.. believe me!)."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff.  Portion sizes were large and very reasonable prices.  My friend and I both ordered the spicy seafood stew and couldn't believe how much seafood was included, particularly for the price.  Fun, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"absolutely delicious and the price was reasonable. what more could you ask for? had venison shank (one of their many specials of the day) and it was cooked to perfection. started with an onion and cheese sauce thingy (its a side on the menu) and ate that with the never ending bread and it was gooooooood. i highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Overall, I thought this place was great! I stopped in for dinner with a friend on a Friday night. The restaurant is nice and cozy; unlike some other reviewers, I didn't think it was too loud. We ordered:

Prosciutto rolls with arugula, goat cheese & figs -- good, maybe not very memorable
Involtini -- great! Mushroom sauce was particularly good
Linguini -- great!
Grilled lamb chops -- quite good
Roasted half chicken -- excellent! I don't often get chicken at restaurants, but the waitress recommended this and she was right
Side of brussel sprouts -- good but not great
Creme brulee -- great! The best creme brulee I can remember.

With 4 mixed drinks ($10), it came to $125 before tip, which I thought was very reasonable. BTW the mixed drinks were very mediocre (their Manhattan was particularly bad) -- next time I'd probably just get a bottle of wine, as the wine list looked pretty affordable."}
{"text":"Good restaurant, Food is made from quality ingredients and served with a friendly smile!"}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff and awesome food. No conplaints. I had the steak and she had gnocchi. Both were cooked to perfection. The menu is handwritten and difficult to read though. Really my only issue with the place."}
{"text":"I tried out Five Doors North for Winterlicious 2016. I must say, it was one of the most delicious places I have ever eaten. The server was attentive and even gave us extra bread after overhearing me ask if anyone else wanted more bread. The food was perfect and the portions were just the right size. I would highly suggest anyone give this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Service is very attentive, food is great and the meat is special. Vito is always trying the very best and you can taste it in every dish. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"God, reading the previous, non-agreeing-with-me reviews, the non-agreeing-with-me reviewers are so off base! (as non-agreeing reviewers are so apt to be)

I love this place and have missed it so since I've moved away. It is the neighborhood restaurant everyone should have. No, I don't think it is the place to see and be seen, to drink cosmos (who drinks f-ing cosmos?!!) or to be a douchebag. It's the place to drink one more bottle of wine than you probably should. It worked as our Friday night date night place or our Wednesday night don't-feel-like-cooking place and we were always proud to bring our friends. We were never disappointed. Never. Unpretentious staff. Unpretentious atmosphere. Great food. Such such great food. Great specials. Always something to pique your interest, even if you go all the time.

Make this your place. You will never regret it."}
{"text":"Not sure why people love this place so much. We were a group of 8 and got to try many different dishes. The starters we're good but the mains not so much. In my humble opinion the food if mediocre and the service subpar. Finally I would like to mention that the place is very loud and the tables and very small and too close to each other."}
{"text":"I love everything on the menu here.  Each entree is impeccably prepared and the flavours are perfect!  The portions are just the right size, and the prices are very reasonable for the quality.  The flourless chocolate cake is to die for!"}
{"text":"Came for Winterlicious 2015 ($25 for 3 course meal).

Decor, the restaurant doorfront is interesting.  There is actually no sign with the restaurant name, just 5 doors at the top of the restaurant.  So, make sure you know what to look for.  Inside all light fixtures are actual lamps with lamp shades which was interesting.  My issue is actually the table (or it may have been the table we were at), the table itself is with a plastic sticky mat which covers the entire table, so it holds plates well, but that means you can't slide plates around if you wanted to share with others, you would need to lift your plate and pass it.

Food, I had the soup of the day (cream of corn), it was okay, the soup was thin for a cream-based soup but it does include a lot of kernels.  I have the pork lion as the main.  It comes with a few mushroom slices on top (maybe 5), lots of green peas, yes, peas not beans and a very potato cubes.  All side components were disappointing (mushroom wasn't hot, peas seems like they come from a frozen package, potatoes were bland), the pork lion itself was overcooked.  For dessert I have the flourless chocolate cake, it tasted good, reminds me of a big brownie.  All portions were okay (not tiny but not huge).

Service, the waitress that we had was very friendly, was positive, came by for drink refills, and was overall helpful and pleasant.

Overall, I thought the restaurant was okay but I mainly return to restaurants for their food and based on my experience I would not come back."}
{"text":"My fiancé and newborn son went here on a whim, I thought it had just opened but the waitress told us it's been open for 17 years (who knew) anyways, the whole staff working were more then accommodating when we walked in. We had a big stroller with us and without hesitation allowed us to put it somewhere while we ate dinner (our son doesn't fit in high chairs yet) 

We had a table in the middle of the patio. It was super busy but that didn't stop our server from being an amazing one. While I was totally stumped on what to get (everything sounded so great) my fiancé found a bunch of stuff he could eat - they accommodate vegetarians lol. 
I ended up getting the pumpkin seed crusted salmon with mango salad and omg it was perfect. Right amount of savoury to sweet with a touch of heat and crunch my fiancé got the polenta with pesto which is AMAZINRG and the Gorgonzola gnocchi which was also awesome. Although o wasn't quite filled next time we'll defiantly be doing more of a tapas style. I can't wait

Great food, atmosphere and customer service. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Our new local Italian restaurant if our first visit was anything to go by! Greeted by a friendly and enthusiastic waitress, my wife ordered the linguini with portobello mushrooms, rucola and truffle oil and I ordered the 10oz beef rib eye (they had a bison special too) and a side of Brussels sprouts and bacon. The food arrived quickly and was faultless, unless you consider the pasta portion, half of which we took home! ;) My steak was succulent and melted in the mouth and was absolutely delicious and the ju that accompanied it was fantastic too. For dessert we shared the homemade vanilla creme brûlée which was excellent. Overall highly recommended, great food, service and ambience with reasonable prices too. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"2.5/5
We ordered, the polenta app, seafood stew, pumpkin crusted salmon, veggie risotto for mains. The menu is hard to read frankly. It's an interesting touch that somebody wrote it out - So couldn't they have chosen someone with better handwriting? 

Risotto was way too al dente. The waitress came to take our order, give us food, and get us to pay the bill. No real service in between to ask if needed anything else, didn't like the food, needed water refills. The resto was moderately busy. 

The floors look nasty, Some areas do not smell great. The bathroom is comically tiny - look at the sink! 

When the plates were being picked up by another employee we told him that the risotto was undercooked. Our waitress overheard and came over finally. She offered to re make the dish but frankly that would have worked over 20min before as we were waiting to have her come to the ya me to check on us. Instead we declined and she was kind enough to remove the cost of  the risotto from the bill. 
Service wasn't attentive, food wasn't great"}
{"text":"Not bad at all! Actually I really like this place! The food was good and the service was also friendly! And everything on the menu was a decent price. 

My bf had steak with mushrooms and I had the penne and I have nothing bad to say about this place at all!

Great place to hang with your friends this summer as they just opened their patio! And also good date spot! Highly reccomend!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious meal. We called ahead because we had specific dietary requirements and they were more than accommodating . We found the atmosphere lively and the service excellent. We highly recommend the salmon . We would have no hesitation in reccommending this restaurant to anyone. The folks we were with were from New York and they eat out often and have high standards.They were most impressed. Thank you to everyone!"}
{"text":"Excellent taste, excellent value, excellent service. I've been more times than I can count.

It's nice to see a place of this caliber with a laid back atmosphere just south of Yonge and Eglington."}
{"text":"My only three visits to this restaurant was for Winterlicious so I was quite disappointed when they stopped giving me an excuse to return.

The ambient and decor of this restaurant is very chill so it allows its patron to just lay back and enjoy the back ground music which goes very well with their house wine.

I still remember my first Winterlicious visit; I had their house salad to start, steak for entree, and creme brulee for dessert.  Till this day, it is still the best steak I have ever had.  It was tender, juicy, and grilled to perfection; it always melted just sitting in my mouth.  My only complaint of course, is that it was only 6 oz  =).  Mysteriously, they stopped serving the same steak for their Winterlicious events after.  Their creme brulee was also something to write home about.  It was my first time trying creme brulee, I'm not dessert fan, but boy was it good.  One of the best creme brulee I have had since then.  Even though my next two visit didn't include the steak, the menu was plentiful and the food was still exceptional.  

Warning: the restroom is really cramped so be sure not to wait till the very last second to go or you might be in trouble.

You have to pay for parking if you're parking along Yonge st but there's also plenty of side street parking if you're willing to take a 5 minute walk.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Five Doors North is a gem! Everything about this place is surprising, for one who went in with minimal expectations, based entirely on their weak logo and website. 

Surprise #1: The place was kicking - and packed (given, it was a Saturday night)
Surprise #2: The servers are younger and remind you of your best friend's older brother. Cute, friendly, wears a RVCA t-shirt, but totally not even in dateable realm.
Surprise #3: They sold out of their fish special before 8pm.
Surprise #4: The food was outstanding.
Surprise #5: The price is more than reasonable.

Not surprisingly, however, was the fact that there were two other birthday parties, other than the one I was attending, going on here. The place is lively, welcoming, and full of a mish mash of people gathered for a hearty meal. Entrees sit comfortably at about $15, and we're talking offerings like BBQ ribs, halibut, seafood stew, and risotto. I shared a seafood stew and veal special with a partner, and mmmmm, both were delicious, tender, and oh-so-filling. 

Appetizers were also tempting, and the blueberry cheesecake was light and blissful - a hit! With all the options to choose from in the Yonge/Eg area, dodge the confusion and head here!"}
{"text":"Went here without a reservation on a weekend night. Got a table pretty quickly by the window.  Steak was a bit overdone and lighting was a bit too dark for my taste but everything tasted fresh with good quality ingredients. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Went there for summerlicious had a ceaser salad to start, tasted great the dressing was perfect, just enough garlic and flavour. I had salmon for the main course and chocolate cake for dessert. Overall the portions were a little small but over all excellent food for the price your paying. Only horrible thing was that my sangria was a bit bitter."}
{"text":"I can't understand what all the 5 star reviews are.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  The menu looks handwritten, every word in upper case, which can be very hard on the eyes.  The restaurant is loud and noisy and very run down.  I couldn't hear our own conversation.  I kept hearing the waiter repeating the specials on the menu to other tables. Even he had to yell because it was so loud in there.   I would have had a better meal at the Keg for a lot less.  The waiter did not even know which wine to recommend for our meal. We asked if the ribs were beef - we were told yes by two different waiters.  We had a gut feeling that we couldn't trust them because of his answer to the wine.... So we asked a third waitress and she confirmed they were pork.  We don't eat pork.  Very disappointing when you can't get straight facts from the main waiter.   
Someone said in another review, their dish tasted like a can of tomato sauce on their food.  That's exactly what it seemed like to me.  And we ordered one of the specials ($27) which was the bass fish... seemed like 2 fillets out of the freezer.   
Not worth the money at all!!  Go to the Keg."}
{"text":"Zucchini, roasted red pepper risotto with pumpkin seeds had perfect texture and taste and plenty to pack home for leftovers. 

Waiters explained the Italian menu as we're newbs to Italian dining. 

Great experience"}
{"text":"Tonight experience in this restaurant was nightmare for many reasons but I will list top 2. FYI, I went there for summerlicious. 

1. First and foremost, waitresses and waiter are very rude/unprofessional. Not even once came to refill the water!!! I don't ask for much but honestly..... I only asked for spicy sauce on the side which they forgot to bring asked for water many times but I was always asked to wait. Yet they end up resting by the bar. No apology but an attitude. When they couldn't  hear me asking for things above they would frown and say \"What?\" Honestly, WTF. Don't expect the customer to shout louder. 

2. The Food!!! Wow, never in my life I had uncooked pasta in Italian restaurant. My fettucine was just hard and oily. My dessert had few rotten strawberries.... 

Overall result, not going back. I rather go pickle barrel or moxies for the same price. But better service and food. 
Please please and please Don't be fooled by the current rating."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly stuff. we had Grilled lamb chops and it was really amazing. Prices were completely reasonable. The only negative point was that it was a little noisy. I will be back there for sure."}
{"text":"#Summerlicious 2017
Came with a friend on Friday night, and we had a great time. My only complaint being that it was impossible to findbparking (Yelp totally misled me on that one), so take the subway if you can!
Appetizer - baked goat cheese with polenta (4.5/5.0) Never had this before so wasn't sure what to expect, but after the first bite I decided that I like it. The combination was great, the flavor was great, the texture was great...a must try for Summerlicious here.
Main - pumpkin seed crusted salmon (5.0/5.0) Solid five out of five. It hit every note: flavor was impeccable, fish was crispy on the outside/tender&juicy on the inside, and combination with the sides added even more layers to the dish! For all fish/salmon lovers out there: you gotta try this!!
Dessert (3.5/5.0)- For dessert, I got the strawberry with vinegar, my friend got the chocolate cake. While I found my stawberries interesting, it was hard to finish the bowl. I tried the chocolate cake as well and found it a bit overly sweet and dry for my taste. However, combining the two desserts (chocolate&stawberry, right??) worked wonders, so I'd say it's worth a shot.
The portions weren't huge (we both cleared all 3 plates), but we didn't leave feeling hungry either. Service was very warm and attentive, the place was packed around that hour yet we were never left feeling ignored or unattended. 10/10 on that front as well. Will definitely return;)"}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant to meet a couple of friends for dinner. The place is small and noisy--but with an appropriately lively atmosphere. The staff know how to deal with the number of tables and many little dishes you can order. A great wine list with a varied selection of dishes--some of which change on a regular basis and a number that are always on the menu. Go for the polenta, rapini, sardines and fresh fishes available. The lemon tart is fantastic. Beware of the fact that you might have to wait before being seated. Overall, the most urbane dining on the Eglinton Avenue West strip."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend for a Summerlicious meal and the food was great. I had the soup of the day, pasta of the day and their decadent creme brulee. The service from our waitress was awesome too. 

We just so happened to be at the restaurant when the segment about them was featured on TV. We were sitting in the back part of the restaurant without any screens to view, and the volume was turned up obnoxiously loud that it made us jump out of our seats. The bass from the show was so high that the static buzzing sound could be heard overtop of the voices from the show. It wasn't until I had to get up and ask the manager to turn it down did anything happen. The two ladies behind me left half way through their meal because the sound was too overpowering. 

For the reason of the TV show being blasted, I give it 4 stars. I think it was just bad luck that were there on the same day that the show was being aired. On any other occasion I am sure it would be a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"came here for summerlicious. it was my first time there so i haven't experienced the regular menu, but the summerlicious menu i found to be only OK. 

had the avocado bruschetta for app, pork loin for main, and creme brulee for dessert. the bruschetta was delicious but wasn't anything that i couldn't make at home. the pork loin was flavourful but i found it to be a little overcooked. the creme brulee was delicious and that was the best part of the meal =) 

my problem with summerlicious is that you don't know if that menu is representative of their regular menu or if it's a super paired-down version. the food wasn't presented very well either- perhaps they were busier than usual because of summerlicious, but based on what i had, i don't think i would go back here."}
{"text":"Came here with the family and tried a variety of apps and main pasta courses and a pizza a well.  Our server was really nice and friendly.  Food wise, everything was a bit of a dissappointment given all the good yelp reviews.  Risotto was probably the worst dish of them all.  Our reference is from a 2 week trip to Italy earlier this summer where we ate like pigs in Rome, Florence and the Amalfi coast.  Overall a real let down if you are looking for good quality authentic italian food."}
{"text":"I had been here a few times before and enjoyed it with no issues. Went for winterlicious this time and for my birthday dinner. What a waste of a birthday dinner! The servers wear jeans, hats and sweatshirts showing how much they care about their presentation. Ours didn't even look at us when we were speaking or ordering and the portions were so tiny we went to eat somewhere else after. My desert went to my friend and his came to me with a candle in it just plopped in front of me. No happy birthday, nothing. The most pleasantries we received was when we were paying of course. You are forced to tip 18 or 20% which isn't right. I'll be sure not to come here again. We were really disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant has to be one of the best and most consistent places in Toronto. 

The food is SIMPLY AMAZING! I have been here on and off for the last 7 years and honestly, every item (I have prob tried 85% off the dishes) are all amazing."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere excellent service, great tasting food and good wine.  Price is very reasonable for such a good dining experience.

Edit. I've been back since twice and both times were horrible. Either the chef changed or something changed, the food was horrendous :(. Used to be my fav restaurant, now I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Have I not reviewed this place?  It's my go-to in the Y & E area.  Being young and eligible, it's the perfect place for a date.  Not only is their handwritten menu a-door-able (get it?) the service is awesome.  Not over-the-top formal, but very friendly and frequent enough.  I've even been here a few times with some shady characters and the servers seem to have a great sense of humour.

Nice wine list, I think. (But what do I know?)

Great appetizers including rosti with smoked salmon, carpaccio, fig rolls.

You can never go wrong with their specials.  Especially if they include elk!  I also love the eggplant parm.  Huge serving and done right - not soggy.  I had a smoked tomato soup once too which was quite unforgettable.

I usually don't have room for dessert, but recently had the creme brulé.  It was as delicious as expected.

I would choose 5 Doors over Coquine (across the street) any day.  (And that's saying a lot because I love French food, and words that start with \"coq\".)"}
{"text":"Always passed by this restaurant with the 5 doors and wondered how the food will be. I finally got to try it and was very pleasantly surprised! There is a patio and just far back enough from Yonge Street that you're not inhaling car fumes.

Food was delish - I highly recommend the quail which is an appetizer portion, but I had it for my main. It's a juicy, tender, crispy bird atop fresh greens. Perfect for a light salad. Others at the table had the ribs (yum!) and skirt steak which was cooked perfectly medium rare. The menu is quite varied here so I am sure it will cater to different tastes. 

The prices are average, imo, except glasses of wine are priced quite high. Majority of the wines are prices per glass $12.50 for a 5oz pour - if you're a wine guzzler like me, it can add up. Two glasses of a pinot (the Cesari which a bottle isn't that expensive) cost me 25$. A reason to deduct a star.

Service was great and would recommend this place if you're in the area. Highly recommend patio seating later in the evening."}
{"text":"I think that the true test of a five star restaurant is whether the star power diminishes as the weeks progress. 

I perused this lovely joint over two weeks ago, and due to many varied reasons this review is slightly delayed. However, my love for this eatery has not wavered, I have recommended this elegant establishment to almost everyone I have come in contact with. 

My experience began with a phone call requesting very obscurely whether or not they served decaf coffee. When assured that there were many cafe options I sent out the triple text to invite a few companions along. Walking in the door one is met by a thick curtain, making you feel as though you are coming into a cozy theater ready to take the stage. Greeting me moments after I arrived was a jeans clad server/host who quickly found me a table for four though I lacked a reservation. 

The tables were full of noisy patrons, some in their Sunday finest, and others like myself in jeans and tees. Wondering what kind of menu might encourage such a varied crowd, I excitedly scanned the kitschy photocopy of the menu and wine list. I could hardly wait to enjoy something on the widely varied list. 

Whether you are a meat lover, veg fantsizer, carb craver or a fish fanatic this menu has a plethora of options, which they delightfully pair with an appropriate wine selection. Both of my companions were late, that however did not stop the server from checking on me periodically and refilling my bread whenever it got a little low. When my table partner finally arrived, Sherry (server) was moments away ready to recite the specials and issue her personal recommendations. 

I began with the king crab cakes on a bed of spring greens grapefruit and delectable aioli, and followed with a side of their stuffed lobster ravioli. Both dishes were found in the seasonal specials, and both were fantastically delicious. Not only were the crab cakes flavorful and exciting the lobster ravioli was melt in your mouth delicious. My friends were also very happy with their sumptuous selections.

 After our dinner, a round of coffee (decaf) was ordered, we encountered our first possible issue...cream...or rather lack thereof. When the cream was requested the waiter ashamedly whispered that the chef might throw something if one requested a tureen of cream. Instead of making issue with now unwanted coffee the waitress immediately asked if we would like it removed from the bill. Crisis averted, atmosphere maintained. 

First five star review attained, hurrah! Bottom line..this reasonable restaurant is good for a date night with the other, drinks with friends or almost any other occasion, I will certainly return."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for take away, so can't speak to the ambiance.  The risottos are delicious!  We usually get a lamb or beef dish as well and have not been disappointed.  Will definitely order here again, but sparingly as it is a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"A very good restaurant with reasonable prices. It was the first time we had a gathering at this location. All of us ordered the same disc. 
The services is good too."}
{"text":"It's very sad when a restaurant you really like plays Jekyll and Hyde on you. But this time was definitely below par. Since it was a weeknight we didn't have too much trouble getting a table. For starters we had the Alaskan crab cake. I ordered a small plate of risotto and the seafood stew. Both were a complete disaster. The seafood was overcooked and gummy submerged in a thick tomato sauce that was barely seasoned. It tasted like someone had opened a can of tomato purée and poured it on my plate. The risotto was strangely sour as well. My husband ordered ribs and matchstick fries and needed a steak knife to eat it (although the waitress insisted it would just fall apart). A very mediocre meal and we are probably not going back!"}
{"text":"Based on the great reviews, I decided to go here with a few friends last night. Overall, the experience was average. I cannot see how this is a five star restaurant..  The atmosphere was loud and a bit eccletic. It wasn't full, which is surprising for a friday night at dinner time.

I started my meat with a Pizzatte with arugula, portobelleo mushrooms and potato. The crust was a bit thicker than I liked and there was no arugula! Maybe they ran out..?

My friend ordered the lamb chops for $19.99, which were merely 2 small chops, lacking flavour and no side..

My main was off the special menu, the 'Miso-glazed halibut with sweet potato, asparagus and ginger aioli' for $22.99 The fish was not very fresh and did not flake as halibut should.. I asked them if it was frozen and they said no, but I suspect that maybe it was second-rate? I was rather disappointed with this, as fish is my favourite food.

We also ordered a beet salad, which was average - the greens were not that fresh - I found a rotten piece amongst my leaves. The beets were very cold, which didn't suit my taste buds. 

The gnocchi in gorgonzola cream sauce was ok - too much sauce and not enough gnocchi, though.. wine selection was average, but adequate.

I think zucca one block north is worth trying over Five Doors North. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Despite not having a reservation we were seated immediately and the two gentlemen who assisted us were very kind and friendly. I really enjoyed their help and good vibes. Came for Winterlicious 2k17 with a friend after work.

Roasted Beet Salad w/ Scallion Dressing & Toasted Pumpkin Seeds (2/5)
Bar Buca's was better by far. It's a cute starter but it lacks in flavour concerning everything.

Baked Goat Cheese Polenta w/ Sundried Tomato Paste & Pesto (3.5/5)
There was a tiny, tiny, tiny teaspoon of tomato paste in the middle ontop of the polenta under the pesto which was a bit disappointing. The pesto was nice and herbaceous and I loved the salad underneath to help complement the polenta. I don't recall any strong goat cheese flavour and this dish was very filling for an appetizer.

1.50$ Bread (5/5)
The bread was fucking amazing. The crust was so crispy and fragrant with herbs and cheese and the bread was so soft and delicate homg. droolzzz

Braised Boneless Beef Short Rib w/ Root Veg & Navy Beans (3/5)
Maybe I didnt have enough of it to judge it as I only had a bite? But it was pretty decent; the beef was cooked perfectly to be honest with you and the flavour of the sauce and the vegetables together made it a really nice hearty, earthy dish but I don't think I could finish this as it would get too boring for me.

Pumpkin Seed Crusted Salmon w/ Mango & Smoked Red Pepper Salad (4.5/5)
This was the best flavour trip I've went on for an itallian restaurant. The contrasting textures of the crunchy seeds, crispy yet chewy skin, flaky but moist salmon, slightly crunchy mangoes, soft red peppers. It was a thrill eating this. The flavours of all the components complimented each other ALOT and I would I highly recomend this dish to anyone to try. The only reason why I knocked half a star was because there was a minimal amount of red pepper salad when there could've been more because I didn't notice any red pepper until halfway into eating the salmon that I noticed it.

Warm Banana Chocolate Pudding (4/5)
I really liked this and I wish it was hotter and I wish I knew what that white sauce was, it was such good comfort food as a dessert.

Flourless Chocolate Cake (5/5)
Me and my friend loved this cake it was so moist yet so fluffy, melt in the mouth even and the blueberry reduction made it perfect! Ahhh, me and my friend are still dreaming about this cake lol.

Looking to come back after work again!"}
{"text":"I came here tonight for Winterlicious and my family and I had a really great time.  The service was a little bit on the slow side but the food was good.

I started with the beet appetizer and it was AMAZING!  It was really tasty and full of wonderful and healthy flavours.  My sister's fiancé had the Crispy Pork Belly and he said it was really good.  The rest of the people at the table had the Baked Goats Cheese appetizer and said it was kind of bland.  I also found it a bit bland when I tried it but my dad really enjoyed it.  I guess it really depends on your taste buds.  The cheese didn't taste like your traditional goat cheese; it had a flavour that was barely there and hard to pick up.  If you are a tea drinker, it almost had a buttery flavour like a nice oolong would.  

Next, I had the salmon entree and it was to die for!  The salmon was made to perfection and the mustard crust (this could have been an accommodation since I am gluten intolerant) and mango salad were fantastic!  The topping on the salad was almost like a mango chutney and I added it on top of the salmon for extra flavour.  It was spectacular!  My sister and her fiancé had the steak and it was a bit chewy.  It wasn't the best steak that I have ever had but it passes if you have to have/satisfy a red meat craving.  My parents both had the Grilled Black Tiger Shrimp Roasted Corn Salad and Chipotle Aioli.  They both really enjoyed it!

For dessert, we tried the Flourless Chocolate Cake and Crème Brûlée.  Both desserts were amazing!  I highly recommend them!

If you are looking for a bigger portion, I would recommend you get the Flourless Chocolate Cake since it was substantially bigger.  I was very happy with my chocolate cake because it was both gluten and lactose free.  It had the perfect rich chocolate flavour.

Allover I would give this restaurant a 3-Star Rating.  I would stick to the seafood and expect longer than normal service so go with good company.  The employees were super friendly and great!"}
{"text":"I do not understand why this restaurant has such good reviews. We went there for Winterlicious yesterday and it was an complete disappointment.
Service: extremely slow, over 20 minutes between the courses, not friendly, inexperienced (stacking empty dishes right at the table).
Ambiance: we had a table by the window. It was cold there! The decor was nice but it was way too dark inside for my liking.
Food: mot as advertized on Winterlicious menu and presentation for all dishes looked extremelly SLOPPY. Like a little kid was arranging them on plates.
I had 
Roasted Beet Salad with Scallion Dressing and Toasted Pumpkin Seeds - a few pieces of beets and scallions pretty much no pumpkin seeds - no flavours - complete disappointment.
For main, I had Pumpkin Seed Crusted Salmon with Mango and Smoked Red Pepper. Salmon was overdone. Luckily, I do like overdone salmon but was served on a tiny salad plate - probably the portion was very small. There was little mango and a couple of tiny sad pieces of smoked red pepper in the dish and a LOT of lettuce. Definitely, not as advertized.
For dessert, I had Flourless Chocolate Cake (vegetarian). Probably, the best part of the meal but the presentation was very uninspiring.
Overall, the food tasted very meh. I can probably cook the same stuff better at home.
I am guessing that this restaurant cheaps out on Winterlicious menu, which is unfortunate because I am definitely not going to recommend anyone to go there. Take your money elsewhere. Skip Five Doors North."}
{"text":"A great spot for a casual night out with friends or family alike - I've been here for family birthdays, as well as Valentine's day with my girl. The seating is a bit tight, and a bit rustic - very New York bistro style. It gets a little loud at times, but  nothing crazy. Service in generally pretty good even when the place is jammed. The food is great - very well prepared and often unique as well (think rack of caribou with Jerusalem artichoke mash). A go-to spot for cocktails and some good food."}
{"text":"I am happy to have rediscovered Five Doors North after having dined here years ago!  It was a cold Wednesday night so the restaurant was quite empty but I recall it being packed on a Saturday night.  The decor is a bit outdated but still provided a cozy and warm feeling which was ideal for such a cold night in the city.

The menu looks handwritten and there was probably 10 specials between appetizers, pastas, and meat/fish, which provides nice variety in addition to the standard menu.  Our server was very accommodating (and also had a good sense of humour) and suggested modifications to the specials.  I liked that for the three pasta specials (I think they have three pasta specials every day) that there is a small size for $12 or a large size for $20, which allowed me to enjoy both a starter and small pasta.  I ordered the beet soup and gnocchi with tomato sauce.  I wouldn't order the soup again having found the flavour a bit bland (I also omitted the sour cream) but with some dipped bread, it satisfied my craving for a warm dish.  The gnocchi was unreal.  I loved that it was served in a pan and the gnocchi pieces themselves were huge and there was lots of extra sauce.  For a small size, I found the portion to be generous without being too much food."}
{"text":"Yonge & Eglinton vexes me.  While the rest of the city has undergone a dining renaissance in virtue of the amount of disposable income floating around over the last ten years, this highly affluent and ostentatious neighbourhood remains an inexplicable dining black hole.  I am hopeful whenever a new restaurant comes on my radar and garners some good reviews -- hoping that it will be the catalyst that will get the 'hood's culinary mojo flowing in the right direction.

Sadly, Five Doors North isn't up to the task.  For all its pretentions, the chefs had a very heavy hand with the salt and olive oil, the meat and fish were overcooked, the wine was merely meh, and our server was a strange blend of condescending and confused.  It is head and shoulders above most places in the area, but that doesn't count for much -- it is still not where it ought to be."}
{"text":"They could charge 50 percent more for their food and it would still be worth it. One of the best kept secrets in Toronto. If you like pleasant surprises, a one page, handwritten menu, and food prepared with sophistication in a laid back ultra-casual, unpretentious setting, hurry over. 

I loved the cocoa-rubbed bison and the apple bacon soup they once had offered on their ever-changing menu. 

Flourless chocolate cake is a great way to cap off a meal too."}
{"text":"I can for a huge group dinner and they treated us wonderfully! In addition to the great service, I was able to try all kinds of food ranging from various smoked salmon appetizers, steak, a few types of pasta...oh my that brings back memories of an amazing mushroom fussili that was absolutely amazing...all this followed by chicken, salmon, and a bit of prime rib...honestly each dish was extremely tasty, although not standout amazing like the fussili. And finally the dessert came around, although typically not the best part of the meal for me, the desserts that evening took the cake. Amazing creme brule (definitely the best I've has in North Toronto), a flour less chocolate cake, and a cheese cake topped with a blackberry red wine reduction...my god, I had no idea red wine and cheese cake was such an amazing pairing. 

Give it a shot. Loom above your heads and check out the cool lighting."}
{"text":"Another great dinner here tonight. Called last minute ( 7 people ) and they managed to get us right in to what appeared to be the only empty table. 

Confession: our go to for these things is the keg mansion but after meeting there we were told it was a two hour wait. I couldn't have been happier when someone suggested five doors and called them up and they said come on up ! Reasons for choosing the keg : two of our party have hearing problems, decent food at decent prices, good service, easy parking, central to all family members. Reasons for choosing five doors: it's way freaking better!!!! My brother and I had the ribeye and while it's not the birthday cake size piece of meat you'd get at the keg we both agreed that it was definitely much better than anything we had ever had there. Amazing flavour. Perfectly cooked super flavourful and ( a big plus in my books ) not stupid big ie not force yourself to finish size - who needs that?!?!   

If you're still reading here are the families' favourites : grilled calamari, avocado bruschetta, the flat iron w Gorgonzola, the pork chop ( I've has that at least 15 times - never disappoints ), the ribeye ( have this the first time you go and you will be back to try more ). A word of advice - portions are generous so pace yourself. I'm not a big eater though so don't let me hold you back if you wanna go nuts !  If it's two of us we usually share an app then get two mains and a side to share. 

In a barren landscape of overwrought and underskilled restaurants ( yes quince, coquine,grano, grazie ,la vecchia and all you other overdone pretentious dumps I am looking straight at you ! ) five doors is a breath of fresh air that delivers a great meal every time. Go early go late just go."}
{"text":"Five Doors has been open since the late 90's for a couple of reasons. Great food & excellent service. I love almost everything on their menu. Polenta with goats cheese, their iconic gnocchi in Gorgonzola cream sauce, involtini, long pastas, short pastas, steak with Gorgonzola, even their roast chicken- all amazing. Good, reasonably priced wine menu. Outstanding service, led by James- best waiter in midtown! I've been coming here regularly since they opened all those years ago & wont be giving up the habit soon!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great things about this busy but very popular Italian restaurant in the Yonge and Eglinton area. We couldn't get a spot earlier so our dinner was at 8:30. The restaurant was quite busy when we came in. This was also one of my Winterlicious dinners. I ordered the Pork belly and it was quite good. Nice and juicy. The portion is small though but that is expected. For the main entree, I ordered the Pork tenderloin. It was cooked just right and quite delicious. The peas were cooked well and it went well with the dish. For the finishing touches, I ordered the Creme Brulee. It was good and not too sweet. Overall, a great dining experience on my Winterlicious journey. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came to 5DN with a large group.  We booked it well in advance for a Christmas party.  They sandwiched 15 of use into a space for 10 in the front room.  The tables were old and uneven, the chairs were all different heights and sizes, some almost like kids' chairs.  The floor was uneven, the whole thing felt just thrown together at the last minute.

The room also had two other tables even though we were told it was going to be a private room.  The temperature of the room was about 12 degrees centigrade and this was exasperated by the door being opened every time another party entered the restaurant, which everyone did since we were inside the front room.

The wait staff were stressed.  One waiter tried to do a rude funny schtick all night but it just came off rude.  The service was sparse and poor. The food took about two hours to come and there were plenty of avoidable mistakes.

The prices are extreme, as high as anything in the city.  I've eaten cheaper at North 44 and they charged a nasty premium since we were a large party (would have been fine if the service was good but it was pretty terrible).  We all felt like they were doing us a favour by letting us come to their hip restaurant.  Perhaps they were understaffed but we felt like we were being punished for something.

So on to the food.  It was pretty good all things considered.  The meat choices were well prepared/cooked and spiced.  The vegetable were not over cooked.  There were some nice surprises as well.  But not everything worked, a couple of dishes were mediocre at best and one person's dinner was down-right bad.  When this was brought to the waiters attention he whisked it away without a work of apology and didn't come back for 15 minutes.

In the end, we all laughed, drank a fair bit, and all came to conclusion that we would never come back.

5DN would have gotten one star if not for the food."}
{"text":"I have been several times since my last review and while I still recommend Five Doors North, I will probably take a hiatus. The food (I think) has gone down in quality and they never change their menu - even though it's handwritten to make us think it's new each night. I find the food pricey and the small servings too big to be true small plates (like the pasta dishes). The ambiance is still excellent though and don't get me wrong - the food is good, but I no longer seek this place out."}
{"text":"Lots of noise and energy with kitschy decor - a fun spot for a casual Italian meal.
Lots of menu choices, all individually (and reasonably) priced. Freshly prepared food, good delection of wines."}
{"text":"Was invited to dine here by friends visiting from the US who have been here a few times. Looking it up in advance to check out the menu I saw that they were featured on TV. That immediately triggers a hype alert for me.

The restaurant is in the middle of the city and finding parking was a nightmare. We ended up parking 3 blocks away and it took us 20 minutes to find that spot. Gotta love Toronto.

The restaurant is small but we didn't feel cramped at all. The server was super nice and helpful with his enthusiastic recitation of the specials. DW went with the salmon which was tender, flaky, moist, and quite delicious. I, surprisingly, went with the NY steak which was prepared perfectly and sat amidst a tangy and tasty sauce. Unique, and pretty darn good!

We started with the mussels which were the most flavorful we've had in years!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place as listed as $$$ - price is more in the $$ range and the atmosphere is more like a bar.  Service was good, however, the food came WAY too fast - ended up packing up 3/4 of our mains, no chance for dessert.  Pasta was the highlight for sure - risotto was delicious.  Also like the option of the app size pasta, however, app size is still quite large - be warned!  Wouldn't likely go back, unless I was in the neighborhood.  Agree with other ratings that the wine list is quite reasonable, which was a nice change in TO."}
{"text":"Two & a half stars.

Maybe I'm missing something here because most of the previous reviewers had so many great things to say about this place.  There isn't an iota of a wow factor in this resto whatsoever.  Frankly I found it to be kinda grungy.  My arms kept sliding on the clear plastic covers tacked on to the tables.  This spot looks like a cheap restaurant makeover place.  Even the glassware is kinda grungy.  You know how glasses get to look after they been through the industrial dishwashers one too many times.  This is totally Five Doors North which made me wish I should have gone a few doors further north and hit up Zucca instead.  

Hooked up with my sista meatatarian, the groovy Shari M. and we were hunkering down for a celebrataory birthday evening and thought this place would hit the spot, especially after reading the glowing reviews.  We ordered some plates to share.  Grilled sardines.  Pizzetta.  Sausages.  Some rolled up prosciutto thing that they brought literally seconds after ordering.  They must make them in advance and keep them in the fridge.  This meant the prosciutto was really well chilled which ultimately means you just can't taste it and it raised the chewy factor even more so.  

Shari ordered a Cosmo and her reaction was to tell me not to order my usual Cosmo cocktail because she could tell by the taste they were using really cheap booze.  Cocktails and wine by the glass is on par with restos such as the Hoof, Splendido, Enoteca....yet were miles apart in terms of quality, quantity and stemware.  I notice these things and even more so when all I keep thinking is about my arms sliding around the greasy plastic table covers.  

Five Doors North.  Two & a Half Doors for me."}
{"text":"Excellente cuisine créative qui demeure toutefois près des classiques. Risotto au boeuf braisé bien généreux et crémeux, gnocchis extraordinaires et service sympathique. Le genre de resto de quartier parfait où on revient le plus souvent possible. Les prix sont raisonnables."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious and tried their $25 fixed dinner menu. It's always a hit or miss with Winterlicious whether it be the menu items or the portion sizes. I went throught the long list of participating restaurants and finally decided to try this place based on their reviews.  And I can gladly say that I made the right decision! 
The restaurant is located on yonge so needless to say parking was a bit difficult to find. I came here at around 5 pm which is extremely early for dinner but had no choice since they were booked until after 9:30.  I'm not sure how busy they are on days outside of Winterlicious but I came on a Saturday night and surprisingly the place was packed by 6. 
The atmosphere of the restaurant was very relaxed and casual with antique elements which added a touch of elegance. The slanted lamp fixtures on the ceiling was probably the first thing that caught my eye along with the collage of magazine pages on each table as design. 
We were a party of three so we made sure to order different items. 

Appetizers:
- Roasted Beet Salad with Scallion Dressing and Toasted Pumpkin Seeds
- Baked Goats Cheese with Polenta, Sundried Tomato Paste and Pesto
- Crispy Pork Belly with Butternut Squash Mash, Carmelized Apples
My favourite was the pork belly, it was very tender and flavourful. And the sweet butternut squash mash went well with the pork belly. I'm not a big fan of goat cheese but ordered it anyways since the waiter recommended it. It was definitely very unique and quite rich. The mixed greens was a nice  compliment to even out the strong flavours from the goat cheese. I would recommend to those who like goat cheese but sadly I'm still not a fan. The beet salad was average but quite refreshing. And just to add we ordered bread to start with which was $1 per person. The bread was okay not too special so probably wouldn't order it again so I have more room for my meal. 

Mains:
- Pork Tenderloin with Maple Balsamic Glaze, Soft Polenta, Sweet Peas and Onions
- Braised Boneless Beef Short Ribs with Navy Beans and Root Vegetables
- Pumpkin Seed Crusted Salmon with Mango and Smoked Red Pepper Salad
My favourite, hands down, would have to be the salmon. It was perfectly seasoned and the texture/flakiness was just right. The roasted pumpkin seeds on top added a nice crunch and the mango salad just added another dimension to the dish. The mangos were ripe which always makes me happy and I loved the flavours of the smoked peppers. The presentation alone was impressive with the salmon served on a bed of bright colours from the greens and the mango salad. 
My second favourite would be the beef short ribs which was cooked thoroughly but not to the point where it becomes hard to chew. Personally I don't like my beef rare or anywhere close to that so I was quite happy not seeing a lot of pink. The vegetables were nicely cooked. Only thing lacking would be the presentation but it tastes great so not complaining too much. 
The pork tenderloin was not as tender as I would've liked it to be but I rather enjoyed the puréed polenta and sweet peas which I thought complimented the pork quite nicely.

Dessert:
- Flourless Chocolate Cake
- Creme Brûlée 
- Banana Chocolate Chip Bread
I liked the banana bread, it wasn't too sweet but I wouldn't say it's the best I've had. The chocolate cake was rich without being overpoweringly sweet and the blueberries on top was a nice touch. The Creme brûlée was served cold which I wasn't used to since I usually enjoy them warm. But the desserts  definitely helped to complete this very satisfying meal. 

Overall I had a lovely experience here and was glad I came across this place (thanks Winterlicious!). The waiter that served us was also very friendly and I was satisfied with the speed of service, allowing some time in between to digest. The portions are also reasonable and you will definitely leave feeling comfortably full. I will come back for sure to try their regular menu items!"}
{"text":"Really nice casual place to have a quiet dinner. The menu selection is very good. I had a tough time deciding but was happy with my choice of Caper and herb crusted salmon with mango and smoked pepper salad. It was delicious and satisfying. Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Good food, great ambiance, potentially abrasive staff if you're unlucky, but most are great!"}
{"text":"This review is for those doing Summerlicious 2015. If you're going to choose a restaurant, this one is definitely up there in terms of food. I went with a bunch of my close friends which include a few vegetarians in the group. This restaurant was highly recommended to us so we gave it a try! 

This restaurant is right next to a store called Poor Little Rich Girl, a clothing boutique. We were looking for the restaurant and it turns out we were walking on the side it was on. The entrance is cute if you ask me. It literally has 5 doors, each one a different colour. 

We were able to order everything in the menu and being the foodies we were, we each tried each other's food. Pics are below. 

Food from the menu I would recommend: 
-Appetizers: The avocado bruschetta was delicious. It has definitely inspired me to try to make some at home.
-Main course: Everything on the main course was delicious. My friend ordered the Parmesan eggplant. I must say I'm not a fan of eggplant, but after trying it I may have grown to like it more :) 
-Dessert: I would recommend the vanilla creme brulee or flourless chocolate cake which is super chocolatey! The Ontario strawberries were alright. I was a bit disappointed by them as they literally just placed strawberries and drenched them with balsamic.

They will automatically add tip for a part of 5 or more. Not 6."}
{"text":"Thanks to other yelpers for finding this joint.

Loved the atmosphere and quality of food - we had a bunch of dishes - lamb, strip loin special, seafood stew and mushroom risotto.  My fav was lamb, very flavorful and juicy.

Price was decent for the portion size.  Liked the vibe was not pretentious.

Would recommend for a romantic date or casual dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Great service, good atmosphere and high quality food. Perfect place for peaceful dinner .. Meals are cooked delicious. Roasted Beets,Sardines,Gorgonzola Gnocchi and flour less chocolate cake all were marvelous.great experience."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out Five Doors North pretty much since I moved into the area, more than three years ago. Glad to report that it was worth the wait.

We arrived promptly at 7:00 and the place was almost empty (although it did fill up as we were eating). We were shown to a sweet table right by the window and instantly served glasses of water and complimentary bread. Good start so far.

For our appetizer, we decided to share an order of the Prosciutto Rolls (\"w/arugula, goat cheese, and figs\"). The dish came with two such rolls and they were indeed tasty, although they did feel as though they belonged at an '80s themed dinner party.

For my main, I went with the Skirt Steak (\"w/onions and gorgonzola\"). I really, really enjoyed this. The steak was cooked perfectly (despite the cut being a little on the chewy side), and the accompanying onions-and-gorgonzola sauce was just about perfect. I also ordered a side of Brussels Sprouts and Bacon, and they were fine. (The brussels sprouts were a little underdone, but when eaten with the aforementioned sauce, they were quite tasty.

I should also mention that my dining companion ordered the famous BBQ Baby Back Ribs (\"w/matchstick potatoes\") and they were as phenomenal as you'd expect. (The potatoes, unfortunately, didn't fare as well, as they were so crispy they basically tasted like Hickory Sticks.)

All in all, a very good meal."}
{"text":"Five Doors North is pretty decent overall but has the potential to be magnificent depending on your choices.   For some reason, our favourite dishes were the appetizers because they were so flavourful! I definitely recommend the quail. However it seems all of our main entrees fell short.  It really just depends on what you order. Hit or Miss. The restaurant itself has a pretty good ambiance and is appropriate for family dining or hangouts with friends."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars

These five doors have been on my radar for a while now, and I had finally gotten a chance to dine in a few weeks ago with a friend.  The five colourful doors above the door front is definitely very unique and give it character.  But definitely not a standout if you are not purposely looking for this place.

We walked in on a Thursday night at around 9:30pm to find quite a few occupied tables.  My first impression was that it is very casual and quite cozy without suffocating you.  Lighting was brighter than I expected to be but it worked well.  Greeted by a very friendly gentleman and was seated at the front near the window.  We both LOVED the table décor of random food magazine pages stapled onto the table.  The menu is printed on a letter-sized paper and had an excellent selection.  From meat-wrapped meat to grilled quail to mussels for appetizers, then steak, pork, and pasta for mains, there is surely something for everyone!  They offer a very traditional wine list at very reasonable prices, so of course, we had a get a bottle!  After much contemplating, we had decided on:

Involtini: $?? (4/5 stars)
Grilled beef stuffed with minced pork drenched in a mushroom asiago cream sauce.  Oh me oh my, the sauce is rich and divine! The involtini itself was great as well. I mean, who are we kidding? What can go wrong with meat-wrapped meat?! But I guess, it could use just a tad of veggies mixed in the pork just to give it some contrast.

Bisteca: $21-22?? (3/5 stars)
10oz slab of perfectly cooked ribeye! Oh it was good! However, I wouldn't be able to say it was amazing.  The downside is that there are no sides that come with it.

Lambchops: $20+? (3/5 stars)
Again, grilled to perfection served over a roasted garlic and onion jus.  Comes in a rack of 4 chops.  Super tender! But again, no sides so definitely not enough food for someone who eats like me!  

Roasted Potatoes: $6 (2.5 stars)
Um... wedges of roasted potatoes.  Great seasonings.  Nothing special.

Service: 5 stars
The lady server was amazing!! Knowledgeable and helpful, but most of all, super friendly!  We loved her casual yet attentive service.  Made us both felt so at ease!  I asked for her name, but I totally forgot now.  Very typical of me.  But for some reason, the name Meghan is what my gut is telling me... I can be completely wrong!"}
{"text":"Really basic meals. For the price we paid, I found it disappointing. The pasta dish was barely cooked and just had some butter and peas in it. The vegetarian options were underwhelming. The highlight was the chocolate cake."}
{"text":"This was on my list of restaurants to try so I was delighted to see it on Summerlicious with so many choices from the regular menu.

I had the goat cheese polenta, shrimp and corn salad with balsamic strawberries for dessert. Husband had the beet salad, Pork loin and creme brûlée. The polenta and pork loin were delicious and a decent size. The rest was good.

Service was very attentive. Our reservation was at 5:30 and our bill was on the table less than 40 minutes later. We were not in a hurry..."}
{"text":"I had the fortune of dining at Five Doors during a recent visit to Toronto -- and was very impressed.  Since there was a large party, we started with a series of appetizers.  We sampled the roast beet salad, goat cheese polenta, guacamole on crosontini, and grilled sardines.  The polenta was by far the most memorable of the appetizers; it had an almost whipped texture, which melted in your mouth with every bite.  I don't normally enjoy polenta, but this was by far my favorite appetizer (but the others were excellent as well).  

For my entree, I chose gorgonzola gnocchi, which was one of the day's specials.  The serving size for their single serving pastas may appear tiny, but it was so rich that I was grateful for the small dish.  I couldn't finish my dinner, even after sharing bites around the table.

We also shared a few deserts: a flourless chocolate cake, a fruit and whipped cream parfait, and a creme brule.  I stuck to the chocolate, which is typical for me; a perfect ending to a lovely meal."}
{"text":"I am not a huge a fan of Italian cuisine mainly because good authentic Italian restaurants are hard to come across in the east end. This place however did not disappoint. For appetizers my friend and I shared the smoked salmon with onion, and capers served on fried hash brown like potato cake called rosti. The potato itself was delicious and the salmon as well. I loved that they didn't serve the brown salmon parts which I dislike because of the strong fishy taste. 
The mains and sides are ordered separately hence the price quickly adds up!  I ordered the seafood stew with mussels and squid in a tomato broth. It was hearty and pleasing! I paired it with a half size risotto which wasn't anything rave about. However my friend's fettuccine was prepared very well. Next time I plan on getting that! 
Definitely worth a try, the place was buzzing even with freezing rain warnings."}
{"text":"The signature five doors on top of the resto... I MISSED THEM.  I was so hungry by the time I got there that I just wanted to dash in and have myself some good Italian .. and of course I would forget to look when I left the resto too.  

That fail aside, I loved the food at FDN.  The menu was handwritten and we embarrassingly took our time to decipher the writing before deciding on our orders.  #derps

To start, we had the house smoked salmon with triple onion salad, capers & rosti.  On point!  Great start to my meal, along with the bread they served which was soft and delicious.

After being disappointed by the meats of a few other authentic Italian resto's, I decided to play it safe and order myself the pasta special of the day.  It was one of the long pastas with chicken and green beans served in a metal pot - I loved it :)  Not gonna try naming the ingredients but they definitely have their pasta game on point here.  Devoured the whole pot as if carbs didn't have calories

For dessert, we had the creme brulee.  Standard creme brulee, I would've wanted to try the flourless cake for more adventurous, but next time :) 

Great ambiance and excellent food, gem sitting by Davisville"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great meal at Five doors - just before seeing a movie at Yonge and Eg. The specials that night were fantastic  - bass / scallops and beef tenderloin with a fois gras crust. We had a great server - Leslie - who was such a sweetheart and was always there with a smile and a story. She's going places ! 
Thanks for a great dinner - I hadn't been there in many years and it's just as great as I remember."}
{"text":"Chose this place randomly while wandering through the city. First off the ambiance is very odd. Seems like they were going for an interesting look but it comes off as tacky and cheap. The lighting is also inconsistent. The prices are nowhere near the level of the establishment and the food. Let me be clearer, this place is insanely overpriced. The service is cold and mediocre. The staff make it seem as though you are bothering them. I had the steak which comes served on what seems like a bed of mayonnaise. If you want a side that has to be ordered separately even though it's impossible to justify by the price of their mains. I ordered a salad which turned out to be only lettuce and dressing. I would absolutely not return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Had dinner here during Winterlicious, it was good value at $33. I had the ricotta/pesto tart, daily pasta special (cavatappi with tomato sauce and sausage), and a flourless chocolate cake for dessert. The dishes were all good, although I wasn't blown away. I wish the service had have been a little bit more attentive but otherwise was a decent dinner!"}
{"text":"We came for a birthday during summerlicious. The appetizer and main were ok. Nothing I would spend a lot of money on. The pasta tasted like it was store bought and the service was kind of lacking. The dessert was definitely the best part. Flour less chocolate cake was delicious."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight.  Fell for the ribs- Really really bad idea.  They were nothing like their over hyped reputation.  Nothing moist there,  with an insipid,  uninspired sauce. Cold,  dry julienne fries laying sadly under the slab of sad dry meat. 

Service was also sub par.  Attitude-rich waiter seemed to enjoy ignoring us. 

Should be \"You had to eat there. Too late now.\""}
{"text":"I have e heard so much about this place, which is on midtown yonge street - an area known for it's good restaurants. I came here for winterlicious and was really excited to try out their menu. Much to my disappointment, Five Doors North was a big flop. 
I started off with the beet salad, which unfortunately lacked flavour. It was very bland and I wished that they could at least provide salt and pepper to help this dish a little. My friend had polenta with goats cheese. This one was better for sure.
As main I chose the pumpkin seed crusted salmon with mango and smoked red pepper salad. Salmon was very tasty and nicely seasoned. However it was supposed to be served with a salad of mango AND smoked pepper. Once again it let me down since there was pretty much no pepper in this salad at all! In total i found one sad little tiny tiny slice of smoked red pepper. As I'm sure you can imagine, mango is very sweet on its own and needs something to balance the sweetness if it's served as a side dish. Frankly the dish was not as advertised! So this did not do it for me. My friend had ordered the pork tenderloin with sweet peas and it was good, but nothing amazing. 
To finish off this dinner we ordered banana chocolate chip bread pudding and vanilla creme brule. The bread pudding was pretty much a slice of plain bread with no flavor at all other than a tiny bit of banana flavoured sauce drizzled over it. It felt like we were eating plain bread pretty much. It lacked bananas and sweetness. The creme brulee had a little bit of vanilla flavour but it was spotty - i.e. one spoon had vanilla flavor, the next one was tasteless - very inconsistent!
To sum up, 4 out of 6 dishes were disappointing. For a restaurant to deserve another visit you have to do better than this. This was my first and sadly the last time I went to Five Doors North. If you want a good winterlicious menu I would recommend The Carbon Bar, which I rated 5 stars for the amazing food and service. 

- Food not as advertised
- Bland tasteless food more often than good
- Pricy (unless you go for winterlicious)
- Loud despite the restaurant being almost empty"}
{"text":"Unpretentious is an adjective I carry with me when seeking out a place to eat in Hogtown, Ont.  Much to my chagrin it is not simple to find a place with this seemingly simple quality.

But Five Doors North, with its primary coloured front doors hanging above its entrance, definitely fits the bill.  The restaurant specializes in a variety of rotating small plate dishes like avocado bruschetta, crab cakes, or roasted beets.  It's a wonderful place for a date because sharing is encouraged and you can be a cheapskate (everything is reasonably priced) and still impress your date."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE restaurant in TO: warm, buzzing atmosphere, an excellent menu including dishes such as polenta with goat cheese and sundried tomatoes (more like a souffle it was so sooo creamy and melt in your mouth!!), grilled calamari, rapini, perfect brussel sprouts with pancetta, and flourless chocolate cake. We never wanted to leave. It strikes that rare balance of being romantic while also being kind of loud. Every bite was delish, and the prices were beyond reasonable. I can't wait to go back for brunch. The host staff was so friendly. I felt as if I were visiting some sort of italian family reunion. LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"We have been here before and enjoyed but this time were taken back when we got the bill.  If you want to read out specials GREAT! But let patrons KNOW the PRICE after, it all sounds good but $23 for an appetizer is RIDICULOUS! Assumed it would've been priced in line with the other appetizers.

Won't be back."}
{"text":"I went here with a large group over the Halloween weekend, and when I say large I mean like 20 People plus.

I tried the following dishes (TRIED, not had the entire dish.....There is no way I could have finished that all):

Appetizer - Roasted Beets - A great starter if you like beets. Well done and the sauce that it comes with is fantastic!

Appetizer - Sardines - I took a gamble in trying this and remember you CAN eat the bones with sardines but don't have to. Really well done and they weren't too fish either.

Primi - Butternut Squash Risotto - I was really pleased with the sizing of this dish. It was about the size of a bread plate and JUST enough. Any more and it would have been too much. The rice was a bit over done for my linking but over all it was great 

Main - Gorgonzola Gnocchi - The Gorgonzola wasn't as powerful as I thought I would be which was a good thing. The gnocchi was great but at a certain point it was a bit too saucy for me.

Main - Sea Bass - The Sea Bass was OK and needed more seasoning, but the Butternut puree that it came with was great. It was one of the evening specials and worth a shot if you are curious.

The service lagged a bit but they did their best for 20 people. I can't wait to go back here again! Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend karen just ate at five doors. The food was fantastic. The penne and sauasge was so good. We will come back again. We are waiting for desert. You got to eat here. And its kid friendly. The desert. Was so good too. We come back soon. Thank u five doors. And the waiterss is so friendly."}
{"text":"Surprised this spot would be so mobbed on a Saturday night, esp. with so many other great restos in Toronto. But crowded it was, and I managed to secure a bar stool all my own. The vino I selected was one of my faves, Montepulciano, which I'd been slugging down earlier at Squirly's. It came in a big drinking glass and not a wineglass, and I always feel like I'm getting more wine that way (though I'm probably not). 

I started with the roasted beet salad with scallion aioli and lotus chips, a wise choice and a delicious one. I was torn for my next course and asked the bartender what she'd recommend, mentioning that I was a semi-vegetarian who ate fish. She suggested the grilled sardines, which I'd been thinking about ordering.  Well, I now think she suggested them because they were so bad that no one was ordering them and they had to get rid of them! They were HUGE (considering that I'd only eaten the tiny canned sardines in the past), and they had HEADS. I quickly asked her to please remove the heads because they were upsetting me. Head removal couldn't save them, as they were possibly the boniest fish I'd ever eaten....and they tasted nothing like the canned sardines I'd had before. WHY didn't I go with the avocado bruschetta I'd thought about....their bread was baked with rosemary and impossible to stop eating. I can only imagine how tasty it would've been with avocado....Next time!"}
{"text":"Went here for their summerlicious menu. Service was attentive and very nice. This place specializes in italian cuisine. Place was sort of dark, would have preferred if there was more lighting overall in the restaurant. (tip: try to get a table near the outside patio who nice natural lighting for photos).

We were a table of 3 and basically tried a bit of each others. Top pick from our table for the appetizer was the avocado bruchetta...so good! For entrees, top pick was the pumpkin seed crusted salmon. It was divine... it was crunchy, fragrant, and creamy! We loved the mix of the veggies and mango with the salmon. And it was a nice portion of fish. Yum. My least favourite of the entrees would be the eggplant parmiagiana. The portion was large, but seemed to lack punch...all I could taste was tomato sauce, and so I found it a tad boring compared to the other choices. All the desserts were great. But my most favourite would be the flourless chocolate cake. DELICIOUS! It was so chocolatey and dense. Who needs flour when this cake melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I don't have a lot of time to write a review but I wanted to post this before I forget. If you go to Five Doors North and the special is the gorgonzola filled gnoochi GET IT! I had it as my appetizer (could only order a salad after) and it was a little bit of heaven. Every fork at the table had a taste and everyone consistently made the \"mmmmm-face\" after (the-mid-bite-eyes closed-this-is-amazing-face). Best thing I've tasted in the last month."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Five Doors. We've been here a couple of times for dinner and we've never been disappointed. We love everything from the appetizers to mains and sides, and dessert! Service is always warm and pleasant. It takes a while to get your order, but I like it that way because that means food is being cooked fresh and not just being reheated or made out of a can. I love the bread they serve while you wait, which you can dip in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I like the handwritten menu which gives it a personal touch, and the simple decors and little lights on the table which render a rustic yet romantic feel."}
{"text":"Nice place with the most amazing gnocchi and risotto I have had after eating in a bunch of other places in Toronto. Amazing food + friendly service = repeat customers
The home made vanilla creme brule was just perfect to finish off my dinner.
For apps the avocado bruschetta is a must have. 
I am certainly going to come back for more."}
{"text":"Great drinks and a fun time. Our server Meg was the highlight of the night - helpful, funny, and generally wonderful. She made the night a great one."}
{"text":"A little past it's prime it seems 
Sad
I think that I've had my last meal here 
Too noisy and not worth it in the food department

Some people seem to disagree with my review but this was my experience and perhaps yours will be different but please refrain from the insulting language - life's too short to call people names over a review on yelp!"}
{"text":"This is one our favorite places on Yonge. Sad to say they don't offer Winterlicious this year, but their service and food is still great. The ribs are really the best around and the service always prompt and attentive. They don't seem to disappoint after many years of great food delights,creme brûlée, mussels,beet salad,Caesar salad dip. Etc."}
{"text":"I recently came here with a large group.  They're not the most adventurous eaters and some of them were vegetarian.  Considering the finickiness of the group, I was dreading this meal because their tendency to publicly nitpick makes for an embarrassing scene. Throughout the dinner, this group magically devoured everything with minimal fuss and left with happy smiles... the only one to say anything was the usual cranky Aunt.  Her only complaint was that the salad didn't have enough vegetable variety in it.  I consider this a 'win'!

The Y&E area is filled with tons of restaurant choices and this one is my favourite comfort Italian place.  It has the warm atmosphere that makes you feel like you're dining at a great friend's place who happens to be a top notch chef.  I wouldn't say the  place is cozy but it's not cold or have polished stainless steel everywhere.  Hipsters would say it's not 'cool' enough because it's not loud or pretentious enough.  In other words, the perfect place to call your own and bring family and good friends.  

 Appetizers are well portioned and have great variety.  In house smoked salmon has a great buttery texture without being overly salty.  Roasted beet salad is great because it has the nice sweetness paired off with the crunchy lotus chips and pungent scallions.  The grilled sardines are a favourite of mine.  They come crispy and gloriously browned for that great caramelized salty fresh seafood taste.  My table mates devoured their mussel servings without sharing and even asked for extra bread to sop up the sauce.

For those who love pasta, this place is a gem.  They're freshly made and you can really tell the difference.  They're not the awful spongey wet texture.  Instead they have a wonderful mouthfeel and the right chewiness from being cooked perfectly al dente.  I snuck a few mouthfuls from a plate and I *almost* wished I ordered that instead of my beloved seafood here.  The risotto here was also well executed as it was very creamy.  The sauce would have benefited from a bit more salt as it was a bit milder tasting than other dishes on the table.  My picky Aunt raved at the fact they had vegetarian options that wasn't only pasta.  She loved her grilled eggplant with the roasted red peppers on it.  

I chose my usual spicy seafood stew and each time I love it.  It's filled with mussels, large chunks of fish, shrimp, and squid.  Though you'd think things might be rubbery in a stew, not this one.  Everything is tender and very flavourful.  I always use the bread to make sure I have every drop of this stew.  Though they call it spicy, I would say it's a mild spice and it's just enough to have that tingle without the burn.

Service here is fantastic as they're very friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  We never had to ask for a refill of water and they just knew when to arrive about asking for another glass of wine.  I also really liked how they're very knowledgeable about the dishes.  My Aunt grilled the poor server about what spices was used in one particular dish and he was able to rhyme off everything."}
{"text":"First time coming here.  Where do I start.... Well, I will start by parking.  If you didn't know, there are ton of inner streets that you can park without paying.  Just check the map before you go.

I was greeted with a warm welcome by the workers.  And I must mention the service throughout the whole night was very awesome.  The server that I had has a very good sense of humor.  

I must also mention about the mirror in the guys washroom. It's like a large TV for ads.  Pretty impressive.

Food wise, the food doesn't come with any sides, so you will have to order the sides as well if you want things such as potato or veg or etc .   I have the rib eye.  It tasted really WOW.  For the price, I would say it's very amazing.  (Though the higher end steaks from Costco would taste just as good).

The appetizer was also very good.  We went as a group so we tried a bunch of them.  The salmon one I liked the best.

All in all, I would recommend this place if you've never tried it."}
{"text":"First of all, Ladies! If u are wearing heels! Please watch out as u step in! The flooring is not leveled that about 5 feet in walking into the restaurant, the floor raises by an inch! They put carpet over to \"smooth\" it but if u happen to land on the araised level , ur body comes to a dead stop and i almost flipped over on my 4 inch sttilatos if wasn't my bf catching me mid air. It's a major safety hassard, not sure how the restaurant just lay carpet over an \"slightly\" araised floor as if it's flat! It screems STINGY! 

 I do have to say the 2 stars I am giving is for averaging the good and bad experiences according to mine and my friends' experiences at this location. If u are ordering lamb chops, stake, ribeye etc. anything red meat, you are most likely going to be blown away by the deliciousness, but if  you are ordering a pasta, sausage and sides, you will be disapointed becausse you'd have high expectaions from reading other's feedback.

I heard bad things about hand written menu. I didn't think was big deal until I got there. It's not only HARD to read in dim light since the person's hand writing isn't neat, also it makes matter worse while it's written in CAP letters while half names are in Italian! They had main course like pasta(IN ITALIAN) on top and appatizers at lower part of menu. UGH! When we asked waitor where was pasta, he kept going on about the \"special of the day covering soup, appatizer, salad , lamb , wine....\" He just wouldnt stop talking about things we didnt ask for. It's like u are expecting a 2 sentence anser but given a 2 min speech before u tell him :\"I dont drink wine\". ......UGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!  N u CAN'T interupt his speech because he was talking SO FAST. So as I was bored I looked up at his face, he had his eye balls rolled on top of his eye brows like he was being possessed  n literally telling us the entire menu of specialy. I knew he was tryign tell u where he memorized in incredible speed , he was talking fast like u are listening to an auction person speak on a bidding war. However the most important thing about pasta, he misssed out the most critical part, when he told us they had pasta with sausage, he meant pasta with \"very GROUNDED\" \" sausage\". Just like when u go to order Futtacinni Afrido with chicken in any restaurant, u expect get chicken breast not chicken bones or ground chicken. My companion was so underwhelmed with the pasta, it was under seasoned, with NO vege, and some sesame sized shrunken bits sausage. 

I was told this is my friend's fav restaurant so I wanted to try. I ordered the lamb chops because my friend recogmended it before. They came out delicious! However I suggest you ask for salt, it had great flavor but didn't taste right, but as soon as I added just a little salt the flavor just exploaded in my mouth. Also they give u SO MUCH sause for the lamb chops, also they arent thickened much. A bit like freshed fire grilled meat sitting in half bowl of soup. I didn't mind it though because i prefer more sauce than too little sauce anyways. I am not into super salty food , so I know the lamb and sause were def under seasoned for salt. I guess I can say it's possible that happens to their stake n ribeye. But welcome to add salt ur own. I will give the lamb 4 stars from what I received, and 5 stars if seasoned right and thicker sauce. 

I also ordered grilled calamari, it came with some dippings and tomato paste. However the calamari was bit too burnt. it had black charred substance all over the calamari on striking white protein. Its actually bitter and the ends of tantacles are all black. I ate it anyways though , just scopped more dipping to mask the bitterness, but the thought of burnt food is VERY CANCEROUS did bother me a bit. I was so hungry that I ate the whole thing and regreted, but if i ever order it again I'd make sure ask not to burn it or send it back. But still it's a good dish if it's not burnt. 

They have AMAZING BREAD! The bread was supplied from cross the street a butcher shop called :\".... and son\" (sorry forgot the first half name). It's the FRESHEST flavor ever! Me n my companian both agree the bread was one of the best bread we ever had! 

The place is VERY LOUD! Because so hard to hear, everyone speaks louder which makes the room more noisy! 


At end of the day, we notified the busboy or the other server that we were not told the sausage in pasta was \"grounded\" , so please tell people it's grounded , also we calmly adviced the server the HAND written menu was hard to read in dark. He just went silent with obviously PISSED OFF grin on his face like he was very offended by our suggestions. He never responded to us and walked off with empty plates. .................................

My conclusion, this place is a decent restaurant for friends reunion, low key  family dinner. Not place for work party, or romantic date. The service and decore bring down the overall of the restaurant rating. My honest opinion."}
{"text":"Awesome personal service from James to welcome us here on our first visit.
All courses were 5* with great knowledge and smiles.
The striploin special was out of this world for a steak lover.
The ribeye was just as good. Everything was just incredible.
Thanks to James and the kitchen staff for The first of many memorable nights."}
{"text":"Food 4/5 - good meats and vegetarian options. deserts the best, try all 3 of them.

Service 4/5 - place is very busy, delivery of hot meal in more than 30 min. They dont have discount or special attention to a Birthday Person! Also its very loud, noisy and dark place. 

Price 3/5 - Its $$$ because 1 person is way over $30 (as per yelp)

Will be back for special occasion. Not for every day use!"}
{"text":"I don't usually lead with comments on service but theirs is truly fantastic.  Each time I have been here the staff have been incredibly friendly.  There is personal touch to the restaurant that is very unique and there is no sense of being rushed (no matter how busy they are).  

I have been several times and tried a lot of different menu items and not been disappointed.  I hold back a 5 star review only because I haven't been particularly blown away by anything I've eaten.  That said, it would be my top choice in the Y&E area to eat."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious. Food was ok, but service was horrible.
They charged $1 for hot water, and did not supply us with bread basket. Portion sizes for appetizer and main entree were small."}
{"text":"Nice casual atmosphere and excellent food!    I got a kick out of the lamps-on-the-ceiling decor.  The appetizers were great as were our mains.  Both the risotto and the gnocchi were tasty although we did feel the gnocchi could have used more Gorgonzola.  Our friends had an eggplant dish that had a very nice sauce, and the sea bream fish got a thumbs up.  Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"3.5

Came here the other night for the first time for summerlicious. It was really fun and a cool atmosphere and the staff were all really excited when we came in because my boyfriend ordered flowers to the restaurant that were sitting on the table (even though we weren't even celebrating anything big :P) 

I ordered the cesar salad, pumpkin seed crusted salmon and flour less chocolate cake for dessert.

The cesar was good but I hate how at some fancier places they don't break up the lettuce nicely!! Kind of a pain in the butt. Oh well still tasted good and the dressing was good and not too cheesy.

The salmon was unbelievable except it said it would come with mango and red pepper and I'm not the biggest mango fan but figured I'd just pick it out, but if you look at my picture ...how much red pepper do you see? Yeah, not that much!!! lol

The cake was divine, I'm not sure really what it was made of but it tasted kind of moussey.

Overall it was a great experience! Not sure if I'd run back but definitely enjoyed the experience. Maybe I'll try 7 numbers next time!"}
{"text":"Food choices were great (especially for an Italian restaurant as I was worried about all pasta options) - they're a little grill happy as the taste is a bit over the top but still great overall and good service. Will definitely go again!"}
