{"text":"The worst service we have ever encountered. Drafty cold table by a curtained window. Stood for 8 mins at reception desk and 4 servers came to ring in customers Cheques and ignored us. We were finally greeted and waiting for our table. Two women came in 10 mins after us and they were seated before us as they were regulars."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, and as all you can eat restaurant, very well done presentation.
All portions are perfect and great.
Service also excellent."}
{"text":"I've been to the Spoon and Fork on Trafalgar many times and while it's excellent there, this Spoon and Fork Plus is even better. We went on a Saturday night, had a reservation and were seated right away. Our server Erika was great. We thought a vegetarian dish had meat in it and she handled it very well. She assured us that it wasn't meat and was super cool about the whole situation. The vegetarian at our table was really happy. Outside of that, we loved every single thing we got, the service was great, very efficient and we didn't feel rushed at all. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Classy, courteous and fast service, good quality sushi and a very cozy atmosphere.  Great for intimate or group gatherings.  This place got me addicted to sushi."}
{"text":"Selection is very unique compared to other AYCE. Very gourmet, very fresh, A+ for quality, presentation and service! 

Your can switch from Japanese to Thai to Italian and back as many times as your tummy desires. 

All you can eat escargot drenched in garlic butter, beef satays to die for, grilled steak and lamb chops, excellent quality sashimi - just some of the highlights!

Not your average AYCE!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this place before I visited Canada, it was the first thing on my list to try during my trip. Maybe it was too over hyped or what, but I found this place to be average. The decor and ambience are great but the food was just slightly better than average.  If you are a sushi lover, then yes you'll probably love this place. They have an all you can eat deal so that would be ideal if you want to try different things from their menu. Keep in mind the portion sizes during the all you can eat are small but the sushi plates are still decently sized. I tried this restaurant twice, in case I was biased the first time. And both times, I didn't find it to be anything special. Also if you're going on the weekend, try to call ahead and reserve. It gets very crowded."}
{"text":"Everything I tried on their menu was fantastic. The food came very quickly and the service was very good. My favourite was the Thai dumpling and the Pad Thai, best I've had. 
You need to go hungry, there really is a lot to try."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times (about a dozen over the last 2 years).  The service has decreased steadily and significantly.  The food is inconsistent.  The location on Trafalgar is better than the location on dundas/neyagawa.  

The sushi is good and the most consistent.  However be prepared to wait forever for items and good luck finding a server.  Perhaps they're chronically understaffed?

Take out experience (for sushi) was a nightmare.  I tried once and they messed up my order so bad.  It seemed as though they tried to substitute less costly sushi orders and had hoped to charge me for full price.  You are best off ordering it a la carte and paying extra (which is what I did), but double check your order in case they add a bunch of California rolls instead of sashimi or golden dragons.

In summary, the food is good and the ambience is nice, I've stopped going because of poor customer service and inconsistency in their food."}
{"text":"The food it generally good here but the service brings the place down a notch. They take reservations but it can still take 20 minutes to get a table and hostess staff is poor. Your food comes out lightning fast which is good, especially for the all you can eat option. But you can tell its rushed and they haven't put the time into each dish to make it great. Sushi isn't the best in Oakville but its fresh enough and affordable. Thai food is fine, but I typically go for the sushi and get my thai food from Thai Siam close by. Its one of the better chains in the area but definitely get a chain vibe from the place."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! Fast service, tasty food, clean bathrooms, good ambiance! Waitstaff were very attentive and capable. The interesting thing about this restaurant is the selection of all you can eat food. They have Thai, Japanese and Italian. The green curry was actually spicy enough for me, but very very green. The black pepper beef with veggies was pretty standard. Escargot was standard. Sushi had too much rice. Sashimi was pretty good. Hot and sour soup was very very good. 

You know what made me sad? No dessert included in the all you can eat weekend dinner price of 28.99 per person. Regardless, I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! I would return here again and again.  The service was great and the food came out quickly even though the restaurant was packed for New Years Eve. We left with a full belly and we had a great time.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went here with my friend the other day, food was decent (sushi was nothing special), almost $80 later we both had stomach flu that night.
Never coming back! There are many places with better food and lower prices"}
{"text":"Nestled in the white picket town of Oakville, Spoon & Fork fits in perfectly to this suburbia.  

Named for the traditional utensils for eating Thai food, Spoon & Fork offers a selection of Thai, some wok-fried Chinese dishes, and Japanese cuisine.

Considering the absolute trainwrecks of most multi-typed cuisine restaurants, Spoon is actually decent in its execution despite its wide range of variety. 

Ika/raw squid sashimi is bottomlessly available, a rare commodity at buffets.  Keep in mind that it's not exactly the highest quality of ika out there, but you get what you pay for. 

Gone are the el-cheapo plastic plates you'd find across the city, replaced by white porcelain or ceramic plates with your food items draped across dots or artful squiggles of sauce accordingly.  Beef tataki is served on a rectangular dish with roughly ten thinly sliced, rare-centered beef on tiny red onion slivers and doused in a ponzu soy.  Green curry (with your choice of beef, chicken, or shrimp) while alarmingly reminiscent of the slime-green Heinz ketchup product available back in 90's, surprisngly has more curry flavour than many random no-name Thai places downtown or in GTA's burbs.  Ditto for the satay skewers with peanut sauce - which, by the way, come in their regular old brownish colours for beef and chicken. 

Other mentions go to the mildly spicy Tom Yum soup, the sweet and tangy mango salad, and the smoked duck salad. 

There's one single, semi-private room seating up to something like 18 people in the middle of the restaurant. Separated from the rest of the room with glass-panelled windows, it muffles out some ambient sound but isn't exactly sound-proof.  Also, with the glass being glass, it's a bit like being in a fish bowl - for example, don't pick your nose and expect to be invisible to the diners outside of the room.  For the record, I said \"example\"!  Not \"In my experience... \", kapeesh? Either way, this place has a pretty nice, dimly lit interior for the feeling that you're maybe in an a la carte place inside of a relatively hip bar or restaurant in the city. 

The catches:
- Sashimi and sushi can only be ordered with a maximum of 8 pieces per person at a time.  These 8 pieces are a collective amount, so don't bother trying to order 8 pieces of salmon + 8 pieces of butterfish + 8 pieces of shrimp at the same time for one person. It's strictly 8 pieces per person. Otherwise, NO SOUP FOR YOU! 
- All desserts come at an extra charge, which you may be jonesin' for after the buckets of savoury food you've just downed (FYI for a cheap fix, there's a dairy head of royalty right across the street... ) 
- Beverages are not included in the price"}
{"text":"If you like Spoon & Fork, BAM! Spoon & Fork Plus includes an addition of Italian food to the Japanese & Thai menu.

The Japanese & Thai food are basically the same compared to any other Spoon & Fork chains. The Italian dishes offered are mainly pasta and ravioli. The customer service was great; the only complaint I have is that some of the steaks we ordered were not cooked properly based on what we wanted (ex. medium, medium-rare, well-done). For appetizers, I recommend the Crispy Ravioli, Dry Ribs, Crispy Beef, and Chili Chicken. 

Overall, this place is definitely worth trying once with the addition of Italian food. It's a bit pricey but worth it, especially for their noodles & pasta and main course meals."}
{"text":"We used to love coming here until they recently changed some of their menu selections and even removed the 'plus' options."}
{"text":"Have visited this restaurant almost once a week and love the ambiance, the variety of dishes, the service and the friendliness of the staff. The all you can eat menu let's you try a little of everything. The dishes are always piping hot when delivered to your table and fresh ingredients are always used. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Things I love about the place: 
- Massive variety, which is very impressive for an AYCE place. I usually go for lunch and there's plenty of options on the menu. As you've likely heard, you can get Japanese, Thai, and Italian food here. Every time I visit I try new things, so my list of favourite dishes at this place is constantly expanding.
- Food quality. The quality and presentation of food here is one or two notches higher than what you'd expect at an average AYCE place. Each dish looks like it was prepared with some degree of care and effort. For example, the escargots come with garlic bread and the vegetable tempura come in a basket with sauce on the side. Most of the stuff here is really tasty, don't be afraid to try random stuff.

Things that are inconsistent:
- Wait staff. The first time I visited the waitress who served us was very polite and prompt. I returned a several months later and while the service was decent, it was never as good as the first time. Many other reviewers mention the declining quality, and unfortunately this is something I have to agree with. The service is the only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars.

Other random tips:
- I went to the other location in Oakville once, would not recommend. The service was atrocious and the menu was smaller.
- Don't get the vegetables, even if you're trying to be healthy or whatever, since they are soaked in a thick brown sauce thing that makes them taste horrible and unhealthy. I'm not talking about the salads, those are good, but there's a section on the menu labelled \"vegetables\" and that's what you should avoid.
- The appetizers are SO GOOD! And the sashimi, and the flatbreads...
- The value is quite good if you think about it, although this place costs $20 a person (for lunch) it's super worth it since you get a massive amount of a wide variety of foods. The price seems much more reasonable once you compare it to how much you would pay for a finite amount of food at another restaurant."}
{"text":"This food is what i would imagine forgotten three week old chinese food in the back of fridge would taste like...microwaved, spongy and tasteless....obviously not fresh or freshly prepared....service and the filthy rug matched the food....not recommended ....if only I could take the star away"}
{"text":"I have been to this location 2 times and have enjoyed it both times. The atmosphere itself it very welcoming and clean, the washrooms are clean and fancy, and the food tastes great. I have been to both the lunch and dinner buffet and the food quality for both are quite good. 

I would recommend this restaurant to any friends who want to go out for sushi to a fancy and well kept restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go ever time I'm in Canada. This place should be in the States they would make a killing. The food is good and everything is made to order all the time. I recommend the tasting menu. :)"}
{"text":"What a great idea, Asian, Italian, and American food all on one menu!  Satisfies the most picky of couples who can't agree on a specific cuisine for dinner.

Nice decor.  Not too busy on a Tuesday night.  Tablecloths with white paper on top and linen napkins.  How civilized!

You order apps first and then place the next order. We ordered wonton soup, crispy beef, spring rolls, and grilled calamari for starters.  Salmon sashimi, spicy tuna roll and hand roll for next round.  Shrimp pad Thai, mixed veggies, and sweet and sour pork were next. Finished with deep fried Brie (not on menu but was recommended to us),  pineapple fried rice (had raisins for some weird reason), and Thai basil fish that was quite good.  Yes we are stuffed!!

Portions were small but a good size to allow you to try different dishes.  Service was really attentive and prompt.  I wish all restaurants had this kind of service!

Be warned that the desserts cost extra!

Definitely worth a return trip!"}
{"text":"This update is strictly for the sushi. We order take out from here at least once a week.  As of late the maki rolls have been poorly made falling apart and being made with the wrong combination of ingredients. I hope they correct the issue soon as they are my favorite sushi place in Oakville."}
{"text":"Alright, so I try to be mostly vegan 6 days a week, but there is one day where I need to eat with family so while I try to limit my meat intake, I have to eat it to be respectful.  

Pros:
-Much roomier than the Spoon and Fork located on Trafalgar.  
-One of the few places that offer sashimi during lunch ($17.99 on weekdays and $19.99 on weekends).
-All the food ranged from good to very good.  The best things were the salmon, butterfish and squid sashimi. 
-They have a huge selection of food with Japanese, Thai, Italian and a few Indian dishes as well. The butter chicken was very Canadianized but a few people at our table enjoyed it.  I wasn't a huge fan of it.
-Service was really good, yet formal.  I'm guessing that the owner/manager of this restaurant read some of the Yelp reviews and management changed recently or they've put a lot of dedication into better service.  We were in and out within 1.5 hours and we placed 3-4 orders and the service was great.  What was great was that they allowed us to order 'individually' and even plated them as such.  

Cons:
-It is pricey for an AYCE lunch, but that is probably because of the sashimi cost.  You're basically paying $3 to $5 more for including sashimi. 
-No dessert.

Verdict: I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"As a child, I was constantly told by my veteran father to never trust the Japanese, or eat their food. But since he now has phase 3 Alzheimer's, I decided it would be good if I ate at a Japanese restaurant. It was great! And even my two kids enjoy it! If only my father would remember who I am so I could tell him! Haha"}
{"text":"Love this place for the all you can eat menu. It provides a wide variety of food mainly from Japanese, Chinese, and Thai cuisines. The serving sizes are relatively small, so you can try lots of different items - my favourites being the coconut shrimp, calamari and any of the curries. The sushi isn't anything out of this world, but it is still good. I'll usually get more of the non-sushi dishes than sushi itself.

The restaurant interior is clean and modern, and it is suitable for either a casual or more formal lunch/dinner. Service is fairly quick from the time you order, and the food is high quality.

It's a little more expensive than your typical all you can eat restaurant, but they do have a wider variety of items on the menu, and you can try things that maybe you wouldn't get at other places."}
{"text":"Official.  First time is a miss, second time a problem, third time the service just is fricken bad.  Not returning."}
{"text":"Love all the Spoon and Fork Restaurants and this is no exception!  Service was excellent - fast, efficient and attentive. Even on a busy Friday night!  

We tried the AYCE menu because we wanted to try a lot of dishes and the portions were perfect for that. 

Sashimi and maki rolls, seafood salad, Singapore noodles, Thai spicy eggplant, Thai basil tilapia, grilled calamari, escargot, BBQ beef short ribs.  All very good. 

Also tried the scallops neptune, seafood casserole and curry chicken. Good but not really notable. 

Overall, great meal. Very tasteful decor. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Ok so at first I had mixed feelings about this place.  I mean how often do you see asian food mixed with italian food.  Of course the foodie that I am I will try anything with an open mind.  Leave aside the fact that its all you can eat the food and selection was incredible.  All the food was tasty and the selections was huge.  You can order anything from Caprese Salad right down to lamb chops.  Of course the portions are very small but order as many as you please.  They joys of all you can eat.  Being Italian I was a bit worried on how tha pasta would be but let me tell you it was great.  The meat balls are da bomb lol.  This place is a MUST.  Just please go hungry"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday.  The food was fantastic, but the service was mediocre.  By the time I received my order, the other half of our table was having dessert. The waiter kept claiming that \"it's coming\", but it never came.  I had to remind the waiter at least four times regarding my order. At one point he said oh we already dropped off your tempura, to the other side of the table.  It was very very absolutely disappointing to watch everyone else eat, settle down and you're just beginning to eat.  The waiter finally acknowledged he forgot to bring the seafood casserole.  So annoying.  Went to spoon and fork and the service there was outstanding!  This is ridiculous service.  The food was good though. Note, desserts are not included in the all you can taste menu.

Rundown: Bangkok style pad thai was too sweet, shrimp paste fried rice was also sweet. Crab fried rice was tasty, the sashimi except for salmon are all tataki, stuffed mushroom is a winner."}
{"text":"I love the location of the restaurant. Easy and have lots of parking . The restaurant is clean with nice atmosphere. What I love in the menu are : sushi, tempura ,grill lamb , steak , salmon , most of the shrimp dishes and fried rice. 
What makes me think about twice before going is the all you can price on the weekend is about $29 per person and it doesn't dessert. My kids are 7 and 5 . They have to pay $29 too !"}
{"text":"Came here with the family for lunch on Sunday and was absolutely blown away by the exceptional service. Food was great. They have a wide selection for everyone and everything came out fresh and hot. I would definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"For AYCE, I'm satisfied. Our server reeked of cigarette smoke, and he wasn't very pleasant. I don't think I saw him smile once. There was another female server that came to our table occasionally to check up who was very nice and always asked how things were."}
{"text":"I like this place much better than spoon and fork at trafalgar! This a little pricy but servers nice atmosphere nice and clean would def go back! Plz close down the trafalgar store cuz they dont know how to serve!"}
{"text":"I liked this place. They definitely have a lot of options for the buffet. I like that the items on the buffet are cooked to order and brought to you. The calamari and dynamite sushi rolls, pad Thai  were my favorite options. My least favorite was the crab fried rice(not much crab). Very nice atmosphere. Service was good once it started."}
{"text":"I loved this place not just for the quality food they serve but also it's somewhat clever rendition of the traditional buffet. 
This is a prix fixe model but with an all you can eat twist. 
The menu is comprised mainly of Japanese, Thai and Chinese offerings. 
Here is how it works: for $29.99 per head you choose as many items on the menu as you want as many times as your little heart desires. The only caveats are: (a) you have 2 hours of dining time, and (b) any excessive amount that is left over is charged in addition to the per head charge. I love this because it discourages waste (which is my pet peeve with regular buffets). 
The servings are tapa sized so that you can order a large variety of dishes without over-eating. 
My favorite items were escargot, sashimi, shrimp, lemongrass soup, petit filet. The food is delicious and service is prompt. 
So no reason to not have a great meal combing different cuisines. 
One area of improvement can be service: while the orders are filled promptly, it can be hit or miss to get the server's attention."}
{"text":"Was at this location last week and the experience was awesome. The hostess was friendly and attentive. I ordered a sashimi boat and the fish was really fresh. The miso soup jade a lot of mushroom and other stuff more so than other restaurants. The price was reasonable. Next time I will have to try the Thai dishes."}
{"text":"Great service with Jackie.  Food was fresh. Hot food are very tasty. Presentation is above average AYCE buffet 

If there is tuna sashimi and spider roll , it would be nice. 

Wasabi isn't spicy 

Overall great experience !"}
{"text":"Normally Spoon and fork has been a great experience for my family. I can't really say the same for today's experience. We started our meal off with a bit of a scare as we thought the bug crawling across the floor was a cockroach. Turns out it was just a cricket (minor details), and after the wait staff saw me looking at it they promptly got rid of it. 

Moving forward, we came here for my moms birthday which was well known by all. There was no mention of this by any of our waitstaff however. The only reason we came to the Oakville location is because it is a spoon and fork PLUS. Which normally means they serve gnocchi and other kinds of Italian pastas. Upon looking at the menu we realized they had removed almost all of these options and they were now basically just a regular spoon and fork which is irritating as they advertise themselves as being more than this. And if you were wondering there gnocchi was delicious but it has been axed from the menu. 

The food came quite promptly and for the most part was pretty good, especially at the beginning of the meal. As we continued however the quality started to decrease. It started with the sesame chicken which was horrendous. The chicken was hard and crispy with the most strong godawful sauce I've ever tasted. It was like an overload of soy sauce and not even the over salted chicken fried rice could remove this flavour out of your mouth. Then came the chicken soaked in peanut sauce.... I don't know where that came from but again, disgusting. Finally to top it off our late order of shrimp pad Thai and veggie pad Thai came. Both had undercooked noodles that were almost impossible to even break off after biting. The shrimp pad Thai was so drenched in sauce though you could see a dramatic colour change and it coated your mouth with an over powering flavour.

To end on a positive note the fried calamari was very tasty like always and we were all stuffed. However, we will not be venturing back out to the Oakville location again, sorry folks!"}
{"text":"service is OK, but the environment is good.
Lots of options for foods. For buffet, the food is above average."}
{"text":"Love this place! A formal dining experience. Love the pay one price, and being able to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Well....we went back, it was my sons birthday and he chose Spoon & Fork.
Big mistake, we entered and waited for three minutes for someone to greet us!
We were taken to a table and waited 5+ minutes and no one came to serve us, or even look at us. We got up and walked out the door, I asked the guy at the front \" what gives\"??? no one working tonight??  He said \" what's the problem, you have only been here for 5 minutes\"
Unbelieveable. Please don't go here!

NEVER NEVER again will I enter this establishment."}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars for its inconsistency. Their sushi hasnt been great lately, kinda sad how the curry dish tastes better than their sushi. But i like coming here for the variety"}
{"text":"I've tried this place only once about 2 years ago, and i loved it! I wasn't sure why i never came back. I decided to come back for Fathers Day! bad idea... the service was far from great! In comparison to other AYCE places, this was by far the worst experience ever!

The food was tasty and some very disappointing. i expected the scallop rokafeller to be guy and cheesy but my scallop underneath all that mash potatoes was cold, the cheese wasn't cheesy yet stale. the crispy beef was great but when i ordered it the second time it wasn't the same! Theres a bit of inconsistency  there. The best ones i would recommend to order would be the thai red curry fish, fried wontons, sashimi, the pasta dishes, and the steak. i wanted to try other things but it never came and i did not want to wait another million years for it to arrive. We inquired about our first order and we basically had to reorder it again. 

I would probably suggest not to come here on days that you know everyone will be celebrating the same event."}
{"text":"Went as part of a group of 14. Food was fantastic in taste and presentation. Our waitress was fantastic, probably one of the best I have ever encountered at any restaurant EVER - we got all our food and drinks and she kept 7 different bills straight. Place was clean and inviting. I will be back. I would love to give  5 stars - however they have these hideous big screen TV s that you can see from everywhere in the restaurant. Imagine trying to enjoy a lovely evening chatting, and sharing a meal with friends - paying way over $100.00 per couple with drinks - and you see Don Cherry larger than life on the TV. Although the food selection here was better than than the Trafalgar location - i would favour the trafalgar location because of the lack of TVs"}
{"text":"You know what? I was very skeptical when my mother first told me about this place. \"A place that serves Thai, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese food? It's probably crap!\" I was very wrong. 

First of all, when I arrived, I swear we had arrived at the wrong restaurant. Table cloths, candles, wine glasses, and cloth napkins? There was no way this was an all-you-can-eat joint. You don't even have to write down your orders yourself - you have a waiter who does it for you! The quality of food is quite incredible. The sashimi is very fresh, and the Shrimp in Peanut Sauce is delicious - it's one of my favourites. The steak and the lamb chop are cooked to your liking, and the presentation of the food is also quite impressive for an all-you-can-eat restaurant. 

The service here is absolutely wonderful. I've eaten here 3 times. The first time, I had Kari, who was so patient and kind. She always wore a smile, no matter how busy she was, and always took the time to take your order, answer questions, and make recommendations. The second time, we happened to have her as our server again - another wonderful experience. The third time, I came here, I actually requested her, and again, she did not disappoint. She is a wonderful person! 

I highly recommend this restaurant if you want a melange of choices. There will definitely be something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Everything is generally good to eat here except for the fact they don't serve dessert. I mean it's $30 for ayce, charge me a little more and include that green tea Creme Brule why don't you?  Don't bother with the steak although the lamb is surprisingly good, and the Prosciutto is a little low grade but does work well with the melon."}
{"text":"This spoon and fork is known for its variety. They serve japanese thai chinese and american food under one roof. The price is 30.00 for an all you can meal that is served in predictable all you can eat sushi fashion with very quick and efficient service. The sashimi is extremely fresh, which is representative of all there all there rolls and sushi. I do prefer the sushi served at the spoon and fork around the corner at trafalgar, but this location may be the overall winner in there crowd pleasing variety."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch at the Spoon & Fork restaurant near Neyagawa in Oakville. I really like it here for many reasons such as; the restaurant is nicely decorated and clean, the booth seatings are great. It provides just enough privacy for a busy atmosphere. The price per person for \"all you can eat lunch buffet \" is reasonable. For two people including  tax and tips comes to $60.00. The waitress/waiters are attentive and patient and they do not give you the feeling of being \"rush\" to finish your order/food. The food came out hot and the flavour is spot on for each any every dish/items; they give reasonable/generous portion that can be shared for two. This will be my new favourite restaurant; its also conveniently close to my bf house. Looking forward to going back...very soon!! (Sorry I forgot to take pictures of the dish but I will include some next time)"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER.
It took them an hour and a half to bring us our food and they didn't even bring everything we ordered, on top of that the manager didn't seem to care and wasn't very polite at all we are never going here again! 
You can get much better sushi for way cheaper!"}
{"text":"Been to both Trafalgar and Neyagawa locations, like Neyagawa location more. Dinner buffet  (served on your table) is a good value as you can try several small portioned dishes. There is almost nothing on the menu that is not worth trying at least once. Love this place and J&J (same ownership) in Mississauga. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but food quality has gone down & portion size even smaller on the executive buffet format.  Very noisy on Sat. night.  Not good value for money.  & last visit there was a piece of plastic in our Pad Thai noodles (see top left of plate in photo).  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good for an AYCE. Service has gotten better than it was a year ago. Never been disappointed. Sushi is above average for an AYCE. If you want an AYCE and cant decide on a genre, this place is worth a go."}
{"text":"Love it. Lots of variety in food choices. Try the ginger tea with your meal. Little more in cost than regular spoon and fork restaurants but still great food."}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe this place has five stars, unless we just happened to be there on the worst night ever.

I came here on a recommendation, and I can never turn down an AYCE spot. At $30 pp, I figured it had to be good. 

What was especially disappointing is that the food WAS really good, but the service was absolutely terrible! They were so slow coming around, didn't stop by to refill waters frequently, forgot to enter food items we had ordered and then acting annoyed when we asked about its progress. One item she said she forgot to put in and then wandered away. We asked later and she still hadn't entered it - AND asked us \"oh, you still want that?\". 

The thing is, even though the food we got was delicious, I won't be back - I just can't justify going somewhere that obviously doesn't want my business when there are ao many other options!"}
{"text":"This Thai place is very weak and not very authentic. All the dishes taste the same and the spring rolls even weren't particularly tasty :("}
{"text":"Did the all you can eat, hell of wide selection
Food was pretty good and good portioned for all you can eat. 
Service was fairly slow,  I think the server was in new.  Other than that, fairly satisfying experience. 
Decor was very nicely done too. 
I hear it's the only spoon and fork to have Italian menu too, don't know how true this is."}
{"text":"Imagine the luxury of a fancy restaurant with the shamelessness of a buffet, and BAM! You get Spoon and Fork Plus!! This place feels so classy with its elegant decor, cute serving dishes, beautiful plating, and 5 star customer service (shout out to Jackie, who was amazingly accommodating and patient). On top of that, you have the option to order a la carte or to order from the \"all you can taste\" menu. That's right; when you're fancy, you \"taste\" rather than eat/binge. When I heard that, I thought that the portion sizes would be teeny tiny--literally a taste, like they do in Anthony Bourdain's crappy cooking competition show. To my delight, the portions were quite generous. Some are perfect for just you, and some are good for sharing (such as the sushi, sashimi, tempura, flatbread and most of the appetizers). Some of my favorites were the French onion soup, watermelon salad (quite refreshing at the end of the meal too), garlic shrimp,  glass noodles with beef, BBQ short ribs, and the butterfish and salmon sashimi (tip: you can order a sashimi sampler if you just can't decide). For $30/person for dinner, I think it is quite reasonable as well as a good value. I cannot wait to go back again the next time we are in the GTA!!"}
