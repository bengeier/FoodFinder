{"text":"Munching on the Steak Alambre taco as I write this review; with my singular hand-sized taco serving sufficient for a small lunch.  The house-made tortilla is thicker than I've had at other taco joints, but it's perfect for holding in all the sauce I squeezed onto it.  The filling is OK - a decent amount of standard grilled beef cubes, but the choose-your-own sauce station is really the best part of it.    Pick from about 10 different ones, ranging from Cruda, the very mild, to Habanero, the scorchingly hot.  I picked Morita (listed at medium), whose spice level reminds me of the spicy mayo you get on sushi sometimes - with a slightly spicier aftertaste and smokier flavour.  Pricing is a bit high at $7.50 per taco, considering a minimum of two orders is recommended for a standard-sized lunch meal.  But the sauces are fun enough that I'd come back and try it again for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Colibri is an offshoot of Los Colibris on King West and offers high quality, delicious Mexican tacos at reasonable prices.   I dropped by today hoping to pick up a breakfast taco but found that they only serve breakfast on weekdays from 8-11am. I opted for one beef alambre taco and a baja fish which came to $16 including tax which is not cheap but not terrible either.   The tacos were huge and the flank steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. I used some of their homemade salsa roja and it added just the right amount of kick. The ingredients were simple but well put together and the taco shell held together to the last bite.   The baja fish came with a huge chunk of battered fish and a wonderful slaw. The fish was perfectly cooked and flavourful, another winner in my eyes.   While there are cheaper taco options available downtown, the quality of ingredients and attention to detail make Colibri worth a try.   PS: Did I mention they make their tortillas in-house and press them by hand using a tortilla press?"}
{"text":"This Mexican pop-up in Assembly Chef's Hall is a bit more expensive than their Los Colibris King St. location. I guess you're paying for the location - as Assembly Chef's Hall is a hip, vibrant place to go with a group of friends or colleagues.   I ordered the vegetarian al pastor taco since this was the first time I've seen a place offering an al pastor (pineapple) taco with oyster mushrooms instead of pork. I had really high hopes for this taco, but at over $7 it failed to impress. I'm from California, where tacos and burritos are a staple food, and $7 is just too expensive for a single taco that doesn't even fill you up. Better places in the city offer tacos for $4-5!   The tortilla was fresh but too thick for my liking - it had almost the consistency of a stiff cornbread roti for those of you who know Indian food. The filling itself was pretty yummy after I added macha crema sauce on top, but I just couldn't justify spending $7 on a mediocre taco."}
{"text":"Love all the hot sauces they had. We thought all the ones we had ( 3, from different level of heat) were all excellent. Tacos were just average in taste, and a bit pricy for what it is: $7.99 each:/   Still, we enjoyed it with all the options of sauces!"}
{"text":"I've always equated tacos with cheap street food, and albeit these are some of the best tacos in the city, it'll cost you a lot of pesos.   I've been searching for great tacos in this city that'll take me back to my journeys across Mexico, and in many ways, these tacos are even better.  For $8, which is a little more expensive than their Los Colibri location, you're getting a decent sized taco with choices of Beef, Fish, Lamb and Shrooms. You're getting freshly made shells made right in front of you on the mesmerizing wheel of taco shells.    You'll also be supplemented with a variety of fresh house made salsa's to choose from.  It may not make me run to the border, but I'll be back here a few more times.."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy this as much as I thought I would've, although the filling in the tacos were good, the tortilla in my opinion was too thick and had a weird texture to it. Couldn't get it over my head :C.   What made things ever worst was the raspberry horchata, I honestly thought like I was drinking perfume flavoured oatmeal given the again weird texture. I can't see myself coming back especially when Seven Lives isn't too far and the other options at Assembly Chef Hall.   I really did like the fish though, it was battered nicely and tasted fresh! The mushroom was nice too but was a tad undercooked and very chewy.  Service was not acknowledged unlike I said something even though I was blankly staring at their menu :C."}
{"text":"Good tacos in the downtown core are hard to come by. I was really excited that The Assembly Hall had a spot close to work to satisfy taco cravings.  First of all, I'll say that the tortillas at Colibri are amazing. It's very hard for me not to drool at the smell of fresh tortillas. This, along with the assortment of fresh salsas, were definitely the highlight of my experience.   Unfortunately the taco filling fell flat for me. The lamb was well seasoned and tender, but the amount of grease that dripped out of the taco was off putting. The Fish tacos were even more of a disappointment. The small (I mean very small) piece of fish was double fried, but the inside layer of batter became sticky and gloopy under the outer, crispy layer of batter. I got halfway through the taco and then realized that the other half of \"Fish\" was actually just batter.  Overall, these two tacos were not worth the $19 that I paid. If I had paid $10 for both, then my rating may have been higher."}
{"text":"With hand pressed masa tortillas and massive portions of crispy fish, these are easily my new favourite fish tacos in the city"}
{"text":"This review is for the horchata alone - craved something sweet in liquid form so I skipped on out on tacos and ordered Colibri's horchata. First I should compliment the person who took the order, she literally ran to a neighbor vendor to fetch a straw when they had none for me. However the horchata was so disappointing because it was full of bloated rice that wasn't strained out. Every sip of milk brought this super unappetizing, awful grainy chewiness with it that filled my mouth. Worst horchata I've ever had. Wouldn't recommend. 2/5"}
{"text":"Assembly Chef hall should be my new favourite fun spot to eat but with missing service and flavour, this one quickly fell off my 'must eat' list here.    I've been to Assembly 3 times now and each time, Colibri is never ready.  First their corn masa was not ready for 1 hour the first time.  The next, they werent open when everyone else was.  And this time, they weren't ready for another 30 minutes for some reason.  When you have everyone else around you ready to plate up a good looking dish, it makes you look disorganized when you can't do the same.  ESPECIALLY at $9 a taco (after tax).  So all the other reviews comment about the costs... I get it and agree with it.  I know good quality ingredients are not free.  When you have other spots in Toronto producing good flavours at $6 a taco and you're 50% more expensive, pressure to create something amazing is on.  Even some of the top taco places in San Diego were cheaper after conversion.    I won't talk too much about the environment because I went into detail in my Assembly Chef hall review.  Simply said, the space and vibe is really great.  MUCH needed for Toronto and the concept is amazing.  Now just for the spots to produce great food to keep us coming back instead of a 1 trick tourist trap.  Beef Alambre - One taco for $9.  Wow.  Even though I saw nice big steak chunks and used the spicy sauce, I was really disappointed.  Its like Colibri forgot to season.  It just tasted like young veal with vegetable oil ... no salt or pepper.  Cooked to medium well on a flat grill.  I couldn't understand how bland it tasted.  Sure I appreciated how they didnt just use minced beef but when it feels like you're chewing a tasteless sponge, its disappointing.  3/5  Maybe if Colibri had their service on point instead of always behind everyone else, I would have the perception they know what they want to serve.  But with the missing service and bland expensive taco, I've got to say that it's a hard pass for them in Assembly."}
