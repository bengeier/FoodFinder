{"text":"This place pumps something that could be incense out their door all year round, but it is absolutely the worst in the summer. The \"incense\" smells like burning hair and rope and makes me cough every time I walk by because it wafts out of their door and onto the street. I have never wanted to go in because I would not be able to be in an establishment that smelled that bad for very long. I especially don't want to leave smelling like the awful \"incense\" they force passers-by to smell."}
{"text":"I  have never bought anything here, but I love to browse. To get into the store you walk through a little cafe/greenhouse that smells like the tropics. I've never seen anyone working in that part. The store itself has books on all sorts of flaky esoterica. It reminds me of the old Omega Books in Yorkville except with less emphasis on health and healing. Alternative Thinking is more about New Age \"Woo\" and I find that more interesting. The back of the store has the type of clothing that one could wear to psy-trance raves. My favorite part of the store is the basement art gallery. It features black light and glowing art which is trippy and incredible. After visiting Alternative Thinking I feel like I've taken a mini-vacation."}
{"text":"I love the cheezecakes here! I can't even believe they are made from raw products and is totally vegan based! I've tried four cakes here and each one has their own distinctive taste and flavour. I've tried the date rose pedal, lime ginger turmeric, cherry almond, and pumpkin spice. My fave so far is the lime ginger turmeric one because the sour taste of the lime provides a good contrast to the ginger and turmeric. The base is nice and chewy. The second one I liked is the cherry and almond slice. The sweetest of what I tried, but still not as sweet as regular cakes. So good! All the cakes are light, creamy, and filling. The base gives more texture and adds a nice compliment to the filling. They are also all really pretty looking! Complimentary colours and nice placement of ingredients on top of the cakes, and all healthy! The cake is $6 a slice plus tax. 

I recommend buying one to share because it is pretty filling."}
{"text":"Think modern-hippy-granola-acid-trip, throw in some organic vegan yummies, meditation tent  and led art frames and you've got yourself this place.

Originally I'd gone in awhile back when they'd first opened and was pretty much beyond ignored after looking around for awhile and wasn't really impressed. It seems that since then they have way more stock, it's definitely more customer friendly (don't expect people to leap on you like they're working on commission, they leave you to browse around unless you need help) and the nice woman at the cash was super friendly and helpful. She also told me to check out the downstairs - great tip - go see! 

I purchased some cool stones (to help against emf, if you must know - there are some fancy ones - I need to ask about those - that are more expensive as well as some humble little stones (3 different sizes and prices) on the table. The prices are great - am secretly hoping for a geode for my birthday so I can pretend to be an archaeologist for five seconds. They also have things like teas, herbs,protein powder, almond milk, TONS of books, clothes for when you need to hula hoop at a Bjork concert, decorated hoops and super fab foods (ALL organic ALL vegan ALL the time)! I bought a great greens and quinoa salad which was really tasty (the dressing was fantastic - wish I'd had more of it!) as well and am planning on going back to buy a slice of the raw cake (it looked really pretty, reminded me of Neapolitan ice cream, except without the dairy, sugar, guilt and stomach cramps).

I think this might be my new hang out."}
{"text":"I'm not one who's huge into new age stuff, but I never turn down a chance to check out a new bookstore. 

Alternative Thinking welcomes you into the door with the scent of incense and some beads, jewelry and trinkets for sale.  

Once you're in, it maintains that mellow little vibe. Look, if you're into this thing, then yes, there's a lot for you there.  Even if you aren't, there's some interesting stuff to be found.  As an example, I found an entire shelf dedicated to Robert Anton Wilson. For those of you not up on your fnords, he wrote the Illuminatus trilogy as well as a couple spin offs.  There were books there for him I'd never heard of.  

If they cover the variety of esoteric stuff they specialize in in that much depth, I think they will be able to provide you with what you're looking for, if you're looking for that."}
{"text":"If you want to be harshly judged by a bunch of white privilege upscale women who sell overpriced clothes and jewelry, go here! One lady specifically with blonde hair was extremely rude to me and my friends and the other women who worked there were greeting us with snarky comments about what we were wearing and dirty looks. I was going to buy a ring from there but was treated so horribly that I just had to put it down. I hope they get shut down."}
{"text":"Yes it is indeed a store filled with books as the category would suggest. However, it is much more than that. It is filled with bulk wholefoods including hemp seed powder, cocao nibs, pumpkin powder, chia seed and much much more at a very reasonable price. 

The basement is sometimes filled with introspective art; exploring spirituality, mindfulness and life. It is though-provoking to observe the way of being in an art form. 

My favorite part about the store is the little cafe at the front with organic whole food takeout - lentil mushroom salad, chili, pesto white bean kale salad, oat apple bar, kombucha, and raw pumpkin and chocolate cheesecake. Again, endless selection of healthy delicious choices. 

Each slice of raw cheesecake is made from soaked cashews, hemp heart and coconut milk as base and topped with mulberry or goji berry depending on the type of cheesecake. A well balanced guilty pleasure with healthy fats and protein to heal your body.

Although it is important to note that no basil was harm in the making of the pesto; the pesto more than made up for it with an array of superfood: parsley, high quality olive oil and hemp hearts. Each carefully crafted salad is made as a balance meal with protein, antioxidants, , complex crabs, fats, greens, fibers and most importantly love.

The chef expressed the importance of cooking with love. Food cooked with a positive frame of mind and love nourish our physical and etheric body. Alternative Thinking explores mindful eating to the next level."}
