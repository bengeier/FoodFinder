{"text":"I recently went here for my fathers birthday along with my family. We usually stray away from Italian restaurants because the food is usually just okay and I'm personally rarely wowed. I must say the experience here was entirely different. We were seated immediately and brought a basket of bread. We ordered wine and appetizers of calamari both grilled and fried. My father and I both agreed that it was some of the best calamari we've had in a long time. It also came out in a timely manner. We then ordered our mains, I had a gnocchi stuffed with a ricotta and spinach filling in a rose sauce and I was exceptionally happy. The flavour was incredible and the meal was perfect. All of my family members were also overjoyed with their meals and our plates were empty within minutes. We finished off the meal with coffee and lattes which paired perfectly with their selection of desserts, a concise menu filled with delicious options. Overall I was very happy with my experience and cannot wait to take some of my friends here!"}
{"text":"I've had Spizzico on my radar for quite sometime now, they're the latest addition to the Zafferano family of restaurants which include Zafferano and Sapore! I haven't had a chance to visit the other two but reading their reviews I knew I could expect only the best. Last night, being my birthday I was craving homestyle Italian with an upscale twist and knew the only place I was gonna get that was in Vaughan so I used my birthday dinner as an excuse.

From the moment we were seated by our server, Julian, was awesome. Explained the days specials, made some solid recommendations and event tossed in a friendly joke or two along the way which kept us laughing.

The venue is gorgeous, definitely wasn't expecting the decor and crazy vaulted ceiling height from outside in the parking lot but this almost looks like a banquet hall in size once you're inside.

We were also excited to learn that last night was the first night of a brand new menu. It was parts of the old one with a few new items and some tweaks on classics. Having never been I was excited to try all. the. food. Period.

The complimentary bread and oil was a pleasant surprise, the bread was crispy on the outside and soooo soft inside. It was bakery fresh and brought back memories of Sunday family lunches with my Italian family which was always filled with bakery fresh bread and freshly sliced cold cuts.

We started with their version of a Caprese salad. It was beautifully presented with thick cuts of fresh mozz layered between equal cuts of thick crisp fresh tomato. Definitely, the best I've had. To add the appetiser amazement I had the grilled calamari, lightly seasoned, perfectly cooked jam packed with flavour across the hearty portion of squid (huge portion I gotta add).

For our mains we HAD to have the pastas, our server really talked them up, apparently, they specialise in the art of the uber hard gnocchi dish. Sachi went with the stuffed gnocchi filled with ricotta cheese, I tried a bite and they were like little pillows covered in a rose sauce. For my own meal I took Julian's suggestion and ordered the rigatoni with meat sauce but subbed out the tomato sauce and went the rose. HOLY SHIT! It was like meat and cheese and carbs had a love child and the damn thing grew up to be a hybrid between a super model, a 6 time super bowl champion (sorry Tom Brady), superman, superwoman and a super sub. What I'm trying to say is SUPER.

Top to bottom one of the best dinners I've had for my birthday... ever. Best of all (and while I wasn't responsible for the bill) it was less than $100 (a lot less) including tax, tip and WINE.

Amazing meal, totally full, totally happy, you've got to find this place, it's hidden in a plaza but worthy of your efforts and data usage on your GPS.

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my husbands birthday with our family here this weekend.
For the first time, not even 1 person had anything negative nor mediocre to say! We were ALL blown away by the taste and quality of food, or server was fantastic! And they had lots of GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS! Seafood options! Great wine selection! The decor was very beautiful, up to date and comfortable!
We love how local it is, finally, no need to drive to downtown to get a fabulous meal!
Authentic, fresh Italian food!  
We were offered fresh bread with balsamic and olive oil while we wait, we all had appetizers and main meals, bottles of wine, beers, etc and for a family of 8 the total came out to about $400 which was fantastic! We all had a different dish, the kids shared a cheese pizza which was huge and looked delicious! We got seated in a cozy corner, enjoyed our privacy- Everything was perfect!
Will definitely be back again, can't wait to try more fabulous dishes off their menu!"}
{"text":"Been back a few times and I have to reduce my 4 stars to 3.

Last couple of dishes over the last few visits have been average at best.

The stuffed gnocchi in a rose sauce was gummy and grainy. The mushroom risotto was dry and a bit bland.

The margherita is still stellar but I'm wondering what happened here. Is this a run of bad luck or is Service degrading?

YMMV here. But give it a chance:"}
{"text":"We were there last night for my birthday with a party of 10 people, I guess this gave the waiter free reign to give us the worst service since tip was automatically included on our bill because of our big group! They took almost 20mins to get our table ready to seat us which was fine since they were busy but they took so even longer to bring us our bottle of wine that my appetizer ended up coming out before we got our wine. I was so embarrassed for my guests that I had to ask the bus boy for our wine bottle (the first and second bottle)  and if he could help us out, which he was fantastic and wish he could have waited on us all night. I watched our waiter while we sat there waiting to be serviced and he was waiting on his other tables, filling their glasses with water, bringing them the balsamic and oil for their bread, getting them drinks and dessert but kept walking by my table and guests even after waving him down,  he even kept avoiding walking our way. The only time he came to see how we were doing was when the restaurant had cleared out. I love the zafferano chain and have celebrated many events there with friends and family who come from far to join us but I don't think I will ever go back or recommend this restaurant. A friend had to send his risotto back because it was lacking taste and the waiter didn't even offer to replace it with another dish, we all had to share our entrees with him because he was obviously still hungry! Because of the terrible service we ended up being at the restaurant 3 hours, not by choice but because of the long waits to get attended to and served. I am very disappointed, last time I was there with my husband was a month into the restaurant opening and the manager came by to see how everything was and served us complimentary after dinner digestive shots but this time not one Manager came to check on us considering we had a big group and the amount we all spent on our dinner and mandatory surcharge/tip!"}
{"text":"Girls night out tonight with my kid so we decided to make the drive to have what we hoped would be good burrata.

This is a beautiful restaurant. There was a function on tonight with the restaurant packed on one side and very few tables filled on the other side. Perhaps because of the function the device was good, but not as good as I was expecting given prices. A couple of misses during the night.

The food? 5/5. We had:
Italian burrata appetizer: amazing. Will go back it again.
Ricotta gnocchi: perfectly plump pillows of deliciousness.
Buffalo mozzarella pizza. Perhaps too much oregano for some in the sauce. Had perfect chew.

We passed on dessert, although the homemade options sounded inviting."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Spizzico since it opened. It is a beautiful restaurant and the service was great! It was refreshing to go to an Italian resto and have young waiters who seemed to be straight from Italy. However, I was disappointed with the food. Everything seemed to be seasoned with old dried oregano. I'm not talking fresh oregano from Sicily! And that was every dish we ordered. Please refrain from cooking with this. If I had a cold, maybe I'd be cured by the load of oregano, but it did not help to salvage mediocre quality food! I am willing to give it another chance, though."}
{"text":"Spizzico Ristorante is hidden in the heart of Woodbridge. Walking into the restaurant there was quite the buzz between people talking, waiters running back and forth  with  their food and drink orders. Good selection of food on their menu. Known for their homemade gnocchi. We decided to order their special \"seafood gnocchi in a rosa sauce\". As we waited for our meal to arrive my mouth watered at all the dishes that past by our table. The gnocchi was delicious with lots of shrimp and calamari. Would definitely go back again. Service was good and the restaurant had a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"My expectations were lower than normal because this place is in the middle of nowhere and it was completely empty on the night I was here, save for one table. But this place exceeded my expectations!

Service was prompt (as it should be with just 2 tables in the restaurant), and my gnocchi was delicious. They're really generous with the amount of protein and cheese you get with your pasta, too.

Now go ahead and look at the pictures below and try to tell me you're not craving this place..."}
{"text":"This is a new Italian restaurant. We were welcomed warmly and was given a seat. With complementary bread to start with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. I ordered minestrone soup and the Risotto  Pescatore. My friend ordered the grilled calamari and a NY Strip steak. The soup was flavourful, and didn't require the additional pepper I added. The risotto was delicious. It was well cooked and seasoned with plenty of seafood. The steak was properly cooked but was a bit salty. Service was great; our waiter was attentive. My entree was filling so I skipped dessert. Overall, it was a good experience. Minus one star for the salty steak."}
{"text":"This place can get really busy so be sure to make reservations when possible! Service was friendly, food was amazing, and decor was really nice. Would definitely come back for the pasta - I had the rigatoni with Ragu sauce and it was soooo tasty and rich in flavour."}
{"text":"Not sure if the hostess was being racist or truthful...walked in at 7:30pm tonight and were told the kitchen was closed for the evening!  Hours on the website show 9pm closing time.  Not impressed!"}
