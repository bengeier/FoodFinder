{"text":"Worst Shisha place to go to. While my visit Calgary I saw this place and came by for Shisha. 
2 minutes into smoking the Shisha I felt something in the flavor was a little off and asked them to make me a different flavor. They made a big deal about changing the Shisha and wanted charge me for a replacement.
They have no idea what customer service means!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place to smoke sheesha in Calgary, and we stumbled upon Quavado. Located a short walk from the 4th Street c-train station, it is both trendy and relaxing. It is quiet and has a chill vibe, but is still a place where you would be able to chat or do work with your friends. There is also a nice selection of teas and food available - the pesto is delicious and the jasmine tea is prime. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere, younger crowd with decent food. Food was ok, nothing special about it.

Amazing Lattes!! 
I've had lattes and coffee at all coffee shops downtown Calgary. Try their Hazelnut Latte, one of the top 3 I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best place in Calgary for a relaxing night of tea and sheesha!
Get the Arabic tea with fresh mint and find a quiet corner to just chill and smoke your sheesha in total bliss! 
Oh and the cheesecake is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Like can I get my money back?2 sandwiches 2 shisha and 2 cokes for 90 something? Please lol it was highway robbery. I've never been back. And don't plan on going back. Shisha is herbal there and it sucks. I make a better pipe at home."}
{"text":"Very poor shisha quality. They use cheap gear and tobacco and what's even worse - self inflammable cheap coal that spoils the shisha with strongest sulphur scent. The sandwich was good though."}
