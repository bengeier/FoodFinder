{"text":"Exceptional!! A little hard to find and in an odd area but totally worth the search. Fantastic food, great service, reasonable prices!!"}
{"text":"Saw the sign for Birt's at the corner of our hotel. We were in town for spring training and are always looking for a good place for breakfast. We ended up at Birt's three times in the week. The bacon was the best we had had in a long time. The pancakes were amazing. Definitely worth searching for."}
{"text":"I returned to Birt's for lunch and harp music.  Jocelyn was the harpist and entertained us beautifully.  It was so relaxing to hear the music.  I had the chicken salad with pecans which was delicious.  Their iced tea hit the spot and refill after refill arrived at my table without asking. This place is becoming my favorite spot for either lunch or dinner. I feel  like I am contributing to various programs connected with Benevilla. Anxious to return real soon!

{"text":"What a fun place...the food is good and the music enjoyable, it's a great place to take friends for lunch or dinner, I enjoy the cafe style atmosphere and friendly staff. There is no other place like it in the area."}
{"text":"5 stars with caveats.

First, Birt's is a 'for profit' part of a wonderful non-profit West Valley charity, Benevilla (http://www.benevilla.org/), featuring a limited menu with unremarkable food and slightly overpriced beer and wine.  Profits go to the foundation so I'm happy to contribute (I've had worse food at higher prices that don't do as much good).  The waitstaff, at nite at least, is wonderful.  Fast, efficient and always smiling.

Second, it features volunteer entertainment Wednesday and Friday nites (donations accepted) that runs from much better than Karaoke to OUTSTANDING.  My favorites are The Jan Petrie Band and Shirlene.

Jan (who works for a local school district) heads up a talented group of musicians with energy, a great stage presence and a voice reminiscent of Janis and/or Aretha featuring R&B and Blues from the '50-70's.

Shirlene is another local treasure.  A Tina Turner knock-off (only 61 tho) who has only been performing professionally for a couple of years.  Vitality, enthusiasm, compelling, friendly stage presence singing 50-60's R&R and Blues with a great voice and greater legs.  I may have that in reverse order.

There are other wonderful talents as well that friends rave about and most require an advance reservation.  

About once a week they also feature local talent at lunch, often an easy listening harp which is a lovely backdrop

{"text":"Food is delicious and reasonably priced. Waitstaff is friendly, kind and efficient.  In addition the musical interludes at lunch add another level of relaxation. Additionally you are helping support the community and programs that Benevilla offer to the elderly, people with disabilities and children. You can't lose, good food, good feeling."}
{"text":"The music venue is delightful, if loud.  The menu is somewhat limited, but prepared quite well.  However, the prices for wine and beer are outrageous (half of glass of wine = $7.50). We were quite surprised when we received our bill of fare.  Moreover, to add to the insulting price, they purchase wine from a local winery, \"Kokopelli\" and it's pretty bad (particularly acidic).  Benevilla boasts that Birt's is here to help those in need plate-by-plate---methinks it's more glass-by-glass and that is unfortunately price gouging.  For this reason alone, we will not return.  And we would suggest they consider becoming a \"byob\" place instead of having a continuing connection with Kokopelli."}
{"text":"Very pleasant cafe inside Benevilla. Great service, nice selection for lunch. Live music some evenings, check their schedule. Used books for sale. Thoroughly enjoyable. Tasty food! Nearby walking paths."}
{"text":"Great food, music, staff...all around good time. Have never been disappointed.  It's the 'go to' place in Surprise."}
{"text":"Music on a Wednesday night was great!  Many good entertainers and a nice place to have a drink with friends.  Food is just ok...limited menu with a lot of fried food."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Birt's Bistro.  When we got there, we decided to eat upstairs.  The service upstairs was extremely slow.  It took a while for someone to come get our drink orders, then back with our drinks, then to bring food...we got there about 1:20 and food was served at about 2pm.  I would've given them 3 stars, but the awesome food bumped them to four.
Slowness aside, the food was very good.  I had the roasted veggie wrap and it had roasted hummus inside of it as well as mozzarella cheese and veggies.  It was a full wrap and almost busted through the tortilla.  It was delicious, the veggies were done just right and the hummus gave it a smoky taste.  It was served with fruit which was also good and I added an iced mocha, which could've used a bit more chocolate.

My dining partners had a chicken caesar wrap and the fish and chips.  The fish looked perfectly fried and there was an ample portion!

I would definitely go back, just probably not sit up stairs."}
{"text":"Great place that is part of a great cause. Found this place while while visiting Surprise, AZ. Fresh food, local produce, used books and local art for sale. Nice place to get away and chill. Excellent service as well. Live music on Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!! Went for breakfast and after being seated we waited over 20 minutes for someone to take our order.  It was like we were invisible!  They walked around us and finally after failing to get anyone's attention- no one even tried to stop us from leaving!!
Unbelievable.
Small basic menu but all we got was water so can't comment"}
{"text":"enjoyed lunch at birt's bistro today.  had the \"birt's signature cranberry pecan 
chicken salad sandwich\".  mmmmm.....yummy!! they have the best kettle chips too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for breakfast at about noon on our first day in Phoenix.  I ordered Birt's breakfast which was great!  The pancakes were very tasty!  The prices were very reasonable and there was even live entertainment, a guy playing a Ukulele.  I highly recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"My husband and I were on a visit to Arizona from California recently and discovered this great breakfast place walking distance from our hotel.

Birt's Bistro has great food and wonderful service! Our waitress Danielle was so nice and we really enjoyed all three meals we had there. I especially like that this place donates 80% of their profits to Benevilla, a non profit that provides resources for elders in the community. 

There is a bookstore and cute boutique too in the building. Check out this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Scrumptious pan seated Salmon. 
Same for the triple berry creme bridle!
I could have eaten both dished two more times!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here several times, the first was last year with ok breakfast, several months ago on a Friday night was awesome, ambiance, people, drinks, etc.., and this is quite unique especially in this area, where the crowd tends to be a little ahhh ghetto for the lack of a more PC word.  But to the point.  The history of this place and what they do for the community alone I would give them 5 stars, their food and price point needs work and you can tell they have been working on it.  The staff is very good, I would recommend above any bar here for a couple or romantic night that you don't want to worry about getting into a bar brawl.  LOL
Bottom line you I would recommend this place and you should give it a chance also.  I'm moving from this town but it would be nice to keep some semblance of class, and this is all this area has."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.   We will definitely go back.  A cute gift shop.  The prices are very reasonable.  You also contribute to a great cause. Part of the cost of your meal goes towards Benavilla, day care and activities for people with dementia."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday evening \"Birt's After Hour\" event. Make your reservation a couple of weeks in advance. 
Great music this evening along with great food and drinks. 
Good time!"}
{"text":"We have always been thrilled with the food at Birt's Bistro previously.   But we were disappointed on Friday morning, Oct. 14.  The toast was burned.  The bacon was past crispy to overdone dried out boards.  My scrambled eggs were fine, but my husband's \"over easy\" had hard yellows.  The potatoes were great!  

We have always raved about this place, so. Am hoping that there hasn't been a permanent change there which will affect the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Have been to Birt's a few times now and am a fan! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is unique. The restaurant is IN the bookstore. Like literally--you are surrounded by books. That has it's pluses and minuses. The pluses is that it makes for interesting conversation pieces. The minus is that the customers will literally reach over you to pull a book off the shelf. (TACKY but true story). 

There is an upstairs section to the restaurant which is a nice touch, but it makes serving difficult. Servers aren't as eager to take care of the upstairs customers and continually go up and down the stairs. If you want to be left alone, that's the place to sit...but if you need anything, you might find yourself going downstairs on your own to get drink refills. 

Overall, this is a cute little spot that is quite unique. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about this out of the way little bistro but for some reason or the other, I'd just never visited this place till yesterday.  

My wife and I arrived at this quaint and airy venue as the lunch hour was winding down, choosing to eat indoors because the wind was kicking up a little bit but it it wasn't for that, the patio dinning area looking very welcoming.  There were about 8 tables occupied when we were seated but by the time we were finish with lunch, we were almost alone except for only a couple of other tables and one of those tables was just a guy reading a book.

I'll not mince words and just sum my dinning experience by asking myself the same question I always ask myself when checking out a new place (new to me).  \"WOULD IT BE WORTH COMING BACK AGAIN\"?  

In a word... NO.

I had just a simple hamburger with fries with a side salad and water.  The wife had a turkey burger with a side of macaroni salad and a glass of tea.  Honestly, the best way to describe the burger is to say that it was completely void of any taste what so ever.  Have you ever had a burger that started off as a flash frozen patty and then thrown directly on a grill so that it's thawed and cooked at the same time?  YUCK!  Now take that tasteless piece of cow meat and put it on a pretzel bread bun (a terrible idea by the way - why pretzel bread)?   I can say that the fries were darn good though so I'm glad that I got those so I can say that there was at least a sliver of sunshine to this otherwise dreary meal. 

This place is also part bistro and part book store and part coffee shop.  So maybe it would be a good place just to come and hang out with a good book and some java, I don't know, I may try their coffee (surely the coffee would be ok right?)  someday but like I said before, would I come back again to eat - NO."}
{"text":"This food was delicious!!!!! I got a cranberry almond chicken wrap and broccoli soup, great portion sizes and fabulous atmosphere with in person guitar in a hipster book store vibe- and the bistro funds special needs and community programs so eat for a good cause!"}
{"text":"I'm a newbie in Surprise and wow this establishment knocks any other restaurant in Surprise out of the ball park! Food is fresh, apparently a hard thing to come across in this town.
I hadn't even left and was already planning my second visit. Did I mention, food is fresh and delicious? 

I love that they give back to the benevilla organization which helps the elderly and children with disabilities. 

I will be back! Great service as well."}

{"text":"Burt's Bistro is a bookstore and artisan gift shop that serves food, wine and also part time musical entertainment. This business is affiliated with Benvilla the charitable organization that provides a variety of services including care, funds and support for the elderly, the disabled, children and families.

I had the Baja Grilled Chicken Salad. The chicken was tasty but not technically perfect. My salad was also missing many of the ingredients the menu listed but overall was ok.

My husband tried the Steak Quesadilla. It was filled with a generous amount of steak that was undeveloped with flavor. 

Our server was very attentive and good natured.

All the books for sale are only $1.00 each"}
{"text":"Birt's is Exhibit A why I use Yelp when I travel.  A nice surprise in Surprise, Birt's is a hidden gem in an otherwise gloppy food wasteland, which I would not have found without this service.  Pass on nearby Tivoli, Lubby's, and the Burger King. 

The setting is very pleasant, airy, with lots of books around to peruse.  Go for the fresh salads, adequate portions, reasonable prices, decent house wines.   It draws a reasonably busy local crowd, so expect a bit of a wait around lunch.  Go again because it supports a local charity."}
{"text":"Clean, refreshing, upbeat, nice view, good service and good food!  I haven't been there in the evening when they have live music but I have enjoyed a live piano player at lunch a couple times.  There is also an attached area that sells artistic items--very well done."}
{"text":"What a super find while in Surprise!  Great ambiance.  They had a person playing guitar and inside it's a book/gift shop.  You can pull books to read while dining.  Super cool vibe.  Food is great.  Try any of the wraps...the cranberry pecan chicken salad was awesome.  The Caprese Melt is another good one.

It gets busy at lunch so try and get in early or after the main crowd."}
{"text":"amazing service great food 
we came here not knowing what to expect. our server was great she suggested we should try the club sand which it was awesome our salad was so fresh and tasty. if you are around here try it. 
The whole staff rocks"}
{"text":"Very mediocre  food with totally uninformed servers.   And, the chairs must be the most uncomfortable  seats in all of Arizona."}
{"text":"We had Birts do a social event for us. A party of over 60 people. Food was excellent, well prepared and although served buffet style, it was served In small enough batches so everything remained hot and fresh.  The Manager, Jeff, was competent and responsive, answered all questions and emails promptly, and did a great job at the event. All of the serving people waitresses and staff were friendly and gave us excellent service. I would not hesitate to recommend Birts to anyone thinking about a similar event."}
{"text":"Something a little bit extraordinary, a little bit out of the way.....very pleasant cafe with excellent food. Wonderful, calm atmosphere and the staff was great."}
{"text":"Birts has a great menu! They are also committed to the community and are in business for a great cause. Books are $1 which is a great deal!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Delicious food. Beautiful display. They catered an event of ours on October 21 at Rio Vista Community Center in Peoria and we couldn't have been more pleased. The only thing that could have been better was if they had put little labels in front of the coffeepots for \"regular\" and \"decaf\" because one of the workers gave the incorrect information. But overall, was an excellent caterer caterer. Showed up on time, reliable, highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a win-win restaurant. Great food, great service, and Benevilla benefits. It was our first visit, but we plan to return soon."}
{"text":"It is hard to find quaint, unique dining sometimes in our western end of the Valley of the Sun, but this place is a gem. It is a precious little restaurant in Surprise.  The place has very high ceilings and yet feels cozy at the same time. Diners are surrounded by book shelves with all of the books being up for sale, as well as a little boutique featuring pieces from local artists and crafters. I have had both breakfast and lunch here with groups of people and everyone has loved their food. The sandwiches are the BEST! What a great place to grab a bite. From their website -  \"Every purchase at Birt's helps to fund Benevilla programs and services, providing care and support for older adults, disabled adults, children, and the families who care for them.\" Eating here helps others. How wonderful! Give it a try."}
{"text":"Service was slow, but the food was excellent.  Delicious, fresh sandwiches, and terrific homemade soups.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Frequent AZ visitor with home in Festival that likes to support locally owned businesses so stopped in based on Yelp review. Nice casual atmosphere and great service.  Food was OK - will give it another try and select different menu options.  They serve breakfast all day.  Someone was playing the piano and there is a small art gallery and you can buy books for $1.  Was fairly busy on a Friday for lunch.  Quiet and relaxing - give it a try!"}
{"text":"Good food! Live music on Friday and Saturday.  Great cause to support."}
{"text":"This has quickly become a family favorite. The service is always friendly and I love the mango iced tea!  The food is always delicious and I feel like I am helping others by going there!  We go here weekly, if not more!  Now I am hungry for their breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I love it!  The food and service are good and its a lovely place to come on a Friday evening for a glass or two of wine while listening to live music and mingling with friends.  There is also a small but growing local farmers market on their grounds every last Friday of the month from 4-7PM!"}
