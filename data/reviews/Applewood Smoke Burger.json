{"text":"If you want lunch in Highland Park, skip Park Bruge and head to Applewood Smoke Burger instead. It is a hidden gem. No lines. Great burgers. Outside seating. Or you can eat in the bar if you want. 

I've been two times now, and both times I was very pleased. These burgers meet all three of my burger criteria: 1) perfectly cooked to order - just a little pink for me; 2) massive - totally worth sharing them; 3) toppings, toppings, toppings - gouda?! caramelized or fried onions?! You're speaking my language, ASBC.

The first time I went, my husband and I split the farmhouse burger with regular fries. I personally wasn't a fan of the regular fries. Second time, we shared the BBQ burger with sweet potato fries. The BBQ burger was prefect and those sweet potato fries are killer. Those SP fries are 100%. Gonna get them every time.

And the staff are super nice, which is just icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers at a reasonable price.  Costs are less than other fashionable burger places with equal quality.  The cajun fries are fun.  Initially the place is hard to find.  It's inside the store front of a bar.  Once inside, you'll see the hamburger set-up in the back.  You order and they'll bring the food to you.  Benefit of being in the bar, or outside on the deck, you can get an adult beverage to go with the 'burger.  Go enjoy!"}
{"text":"Go for the Applewood Burger and Sriracha Honey Wings. Food was delicious and well prepared.  First time here but I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Pittsburgh. Way better than other local burger shops (e.g., BRGR, Burgatory...). The Applewood burger was so good. Has apple slices on top of the patty, which is big enough and cooked perfectly. Sweet potato fries also perfect. Highly recommend!!

The only (minor) issue is that this restaurant is hard to find for the first time. You should come into the pub then you will see the grill inside."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was there. Now I'm kicking myself for not trying it sooner. The Park Place Pub is a decent bar but these burgers are amazing. You order and pay separate from the bar. Cooked to order with a great selection of toppings and the bread is fresh and light. The ingredients are locally sourced and taste great. 
If you don't feel like a beer from the bar,  they have a nice variety of fun sodas like red ribbon and Mexican coke. 
If you live in the east end go here now! If you're farther away,  this burger is worth the trip."}
{"text":"I cannot give this place enough praise.
I live near Park Place Pub, and had only been in there once, and there was no kitchen. I wasn't going to go back.
Then Applewood Smoke Burger Co. came, and I'll never get another burger. Better than any other burger I've tried in Pittsburgh, and that's including Burgatory and Stack'd. 
The burger is always cooked perfectly as ordered, and always assembled beautifully. Their chicken sandwich is amazing, and so are their appetizers.
Seriously, if you find yourself in Highland Park, skip hopping over the bridge to Burgatory, skip their neighbor Park Brugge, and go here. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"This.. This is the best burger around. Hell of a great sandwich. Homemade fries and onion rings rock. I've had the salads and they're delicious. Now I've given you my best kept secret. You're welcome John Q Public.."}
{"text":"We stopped on our way down to Florida, Siri said this fabulous place was the most highly recommended burger place in Pittsburg, it did not disappoint! Burgers were fresh and delicious, juicy, tasty and perfectly cooked, the wonderful man that cooked and served us was awesome, cute and friendly! We will definitely go out of our way to stop by this burger joint again! Can't wait! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Burgers and fries are amazing. They'll even cook it to the temperature you want. They have some great burger creations and you can craft you're own.

Definitely worth checking this place out. Burgers are better than Burgatory or BRGR without question."}
{"text":"While I have not tried all of the \"top\" burger places in Pittsburgh, I can confidently say this is one of the best. My medium rare Applewood Burger was cooked perfectly. All of the flavors worked well together-salty, sweet, and savory. Can't wait to go back and try another one of their creative concoctions. There homemade fries were good as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. It's located in Park Place Pub, but under separate ownership. Unfortunately, the pub doesn't live up to the burgers."}
{"text":"Burgers are amazing. Wings, fries and OMG the onion rings are not far behind. For burgers 'n beer it doesn't get much better than this cozy pub. Service also very very good. You really need to check this place out."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. There are a couple of popular restaurants close by, but you can still generally find street parking within a block. The Applewood is actually a somewhat separate establishment from the Park Place Pub, though they are in the same building, so you buy your beer separately from the burgers. My husband and I bring a deck of cards and play a couple hands of gin, and have a beer while we wait for the food. Everybody's super nice, the atmosphere is chill, and the burgers are AWESOME. It's not fancy, but it's delicious, and a great way to unwind after work. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Typically very good food. I did get a gross chicken sandwich once. The chicken was like rubber and inedible. Stick with a burger or a salad and this place will treat you right. I also love the outdoor seating. It is great to bring kids so they can run around while you and your spouse try for 5 minutes of adult conversation. :)"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! The place may look like any old dingy bar on the outside but SWEETJESUS the burgers are so delicious. Literally you should come just for the burgers.

I've been to ASBC twice and I got the Applewood burger both times. I love the combination of the sweet (the apples and the maple sauce) with the savory (the beef, bacon, bun, etc.) and all the ingredients are deployed beautifully.

While I think ASBC has some of the best burgers in Pittsburgh, everything else about the restaurant is ok. The fries are pretty decent but not nearly as good as the burger and their menu is a little on the pricey side. ASBC is also located in the Park Place Pub which is a small, laid-back bar with a fairly limited beer list.

But this place is actually burger heaven. If I lived in Highland Park, my bank account would be virtually non-existent because I would eat at Applewood literally all the time."}
{"text":"Bacon and blue burger was awesome.  Cooked to perfection.  One of the best burgers in the city. Great spot to hang out and listen to fun tunes."}
{"text":"Man what a burger!

So, my daughter's birthday day was coming up and I knew how much she loves burgers so I decided to give Applewood a try as we hadn't been before. Parking can be difficult as there are quite a few famous places in the same block so scoring a close parking space may be tough. 

Upon arriving we were a little confused as there is no signage for Applewood Smoke Burger Company just Park Place Pub. The burger section is in the back of the pub. They offer specialty burgers, build your own burgers, chicken sandwiches, a vegetarian sandwich, salads, wraps, fresh cut fries, Cajun fries, Bleu fries (crumbled bacon and Bleu cheese), Sweet potato fries and onion rings.

After we made our orders I couldn't help but look at a order of Cajun Dust wings that a guy sitting by us was inhaling. They smelled so good I ordered a dozen for us to try. Let me just say that the wings were EPIC! I usually don't care for dry rub wings but, these were outstanding! The chicken was hot and juicy and the dry rub went perfect with the favor of the wing. They were both in perfect harmony.

The birthday girl and I both choose the Blues Burger. I got mine with Cajun fries and she got hers with cheese fries. It featured blue cheese, Applewood smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo. It was one of the top 5 best burgers I have ever had in my life! The beef patty was perfectly cooked just like I requested and the smoked bacon was just as good. The fresh Bleu cheese was the perfect complement to the burger and even went well with the wings. My meal was absolutely perfect in every way. Our daughter was more than pleased with her meal as well.

The wife got a Bayou Burger with onion rings. It features grilled onions, blackened tomato, banana peppers, Pepper Jack cheese and Chipotle mayo. She loved her burger and onion rings as well.

Applewood Smoke Burger Company is a hidden gem that more than justifies the search to find it and boy am I glad that I did!"}
{"text":"We're lucky to have this as a neighborhood burger joint. Lots of creative menu items to choose from. And if you just want \"normal 'merican cheeburger\" then that's quality too. Good ingredients, friendly service. Always a good decision for late night dinner."}
{"text":"You need to seriously try this place out. Hamburgers are absolutely amazing!! way better then  BRGR and the wings are freaking bomb!!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not the easiest place to find....but once you do, you won't be disappointed! 

The burgers are great that are cooked to your likings. The applebutter BBQ burger is delicious and I highly recommend it! The employees are also very friendly :)

Everyone go enjoy!"}
{"text":"We were really craving an amazing burger - hole in the wall, local flare. We found it! I created my own burger and my boy had one of their classic burgers. Of course we also had to try the fries and the onion rings! We were not disappointed, it was an awesome meal! We usually don't eat this heavy on most days but it was sure worth the cheat!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I accidentally stumbled upon this little gem because I thought it was a local pub (as the sign outside advertised). But once inside, I realized it's a legit burger joint. The service was phenomenal. I wasn't really expecting to be waited on since it seemed like a self-served place, but both the cashier and chef checked up on my table multiple times. The burgers were big and juicy with the right amount of everything. They cook it to the texture that you desire, for me it was medium rare. The side of fries was equally satisfying. Even after adjusting the elastic of my pants, I could not finish my entire plate. The portion was glorious along with the service and food. Definitely check this place out if you're a burger fanatic!"}
{"text":"Best onion rings I've ever had!  Amazing burgers cooked to perfection.  Great place with a cool neighborhood vibe."}
{"text":"The new proprietors of the kitchen have successfully created the best burger that I have ever tasted.  The burgers consist of different hand ground cuts of hormone free, free range beef.  The French fries are double blanched, double fried guaranteeing a crisp, yummy fry.  The onion rings are cut to order, the tempura batter light and the homemade dipping sauce perfect.  Stop in and ask for James, one of the new owners and the chef."}
{"text":"Agreeing with Ryann J below. Absolutely a hidden gem! 

I had been skeptical of trying this place because it's in the back of Park Place Pub, which always seems empty. It's the kind of bar where you walk in and get stared at because you're not one of the few people who go there all the time. We tried for burgers one weekend when they were closed and then finally lucked out recently. We call in our order when we get burgers here and take them home to eat. They take about 15-20 minutes to cook and come well packaged in styrofoam containers with little holes to vent out steam so the bun and fires don't get soggy. When the weather is nice, maybe we'll eat on the Park Place Pub deck, since I love eating outside.

My boyfriend got the farmhouse burger and I got the bayou burger. We both ordered them medium and they were cooked perfectly, and super juicy. The farmhouse egg was dripping everywhere and looked delicious. The bayou was really well spiced, but not super spicy, so you could definitely still focus on the burger and other flavors. The buns were great too.

Their fries are pretty good, especially the bacon cheese fries (since our order was to go, they actually kept the cheese and bacon separate for us so nothing would get too soggy...so thoughtful!), but I love their onion rings. They are huge and come with a delicious horseradish dipping sauce. I grew up making onion rings with horseradish dip so the sauce is perfect for me, and is exactly what should be served with all onion rings.

I'd really recommend this place. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it and have been there twice. I sometimes forget about it since it's not a typical restaurant but their burgers are seriously amazing and as much as I love the custom burgers at Burgatory, I think I'd choose here for the best burger in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Yea I should have known from the divey feel and lack of ppl. It had all the makings of a good burger, good toppings thick and juicy, soft fries. The thing it was lacking was FLAVOR. It really doesn't hurt to season the meat, trust me it helps. Anyways had the mushroom Swiss and added an egg. The egg was over easy which was great the mushrooms were bug pieces great, but just no flavor across the board. Price was decent. Service not so friendly. If you want a burger I'd try somewhere else until someone gives them some seasonings."}
{"text":"I had a craving for a good burger and the reviews led me here. As others have commented, it is easy to miss but it's  because it's  located in the back of a bar. Something I didn't realize until GPS kept telling us we arrived. 

You can head straight back to the counter to order and either take out or dine in. There are some really tasty burger combinations on the menu  or you can opt to create your own masterpiece. I chose the mushroom swiss and swapped the swiss for provolone.  The burger came with fries, onion rings or  sweet potato fries. I ordered the regular fries dressed with bacon and cheese sauce and it was on....

There isn't  a ton of seating but we quickly nabbed a table. If you would like to indulge in a libation or fountain drink, you can order that directly from the bar. The bar and restaurant do not share registers which is really no big deal...just a heads up. 

Shortly after we sat down,  our food was served by the extremely polite waitress. One bite and it was all all stars, hearts and rainbows. I mean this was one juicy burger. I enjoy meat medium to medium rare and this was perfect.  The mushrooms were perfectly cooked and the bread was substantial and held the meat and toppings in place. Fries were perfectly salted with an adequate amount of crumbled bacon and cheese sauce. It was well worth every single calorie!!!

This place is back in the cut, it has a nice feel to it and the folks are very friendly, going out of their way to check and make sure you're  enjoying your meal. I'm looking forward to testing out some other combos from their menu. 

Juicy burger seekers....check it outtttt!!!"}
{"text":"I loved the burger. Very thick and juicy burger. I'll be back for sure. Will have to try the wings and a salad next time."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I've had in Pittsburgh. Tucked away in Park Place Pub (which also merits its own glowing Yelp review), this is truly a hidden gem. Get the Applewood burger--with its grilled apples, gouda, thick-cut bacon, and maple sauce (?!)--you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ehh, it was barely ok.

Ordered a medium/ medium well bayou burger. Came out over cooked, with about a dozen soggy French fries.

I have had more enjoyable burgers at Wendy's, and if I am paying $13 for a hamburger, I sort of expect it to be cooked the way I order it. 

Beer had yeast buildup. Clean your taps once in a while.

Outdoor table seating covered in bird crap."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with my family and we had a wonderful time! The back patio was lovely, the service phenomenal and the food delicious. 

The burgers were juicy and flavorful, with soft rolls and delicious toppings. I ordered the Applewood Burger. Perfection. My brother got the Bayou Burger- he said it had the perfect amount of spice, without being a kick in the face. My sister got the grilled cheese, which she loved. The onion rings and fries were also delicious. 

But what's a great burger with out great beverages? They had good beer on tap and a wide range of specialty soda's.

A solid, satisfying meal on a cool summer night. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great Burgers in Highland Park! Fairly discreet place in the back of Park Place Pub, but worth the trip in to enjoy their burgers. Whether you like it simple (order the slammer) or something with more toppings their are plenty of options. Don't base your decision on the bar as they are separate owners, not a place that I would hang out all night, but definitely worth the stop for the food! If you're looking for a menu visit their Facebook page."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tasting burger I've ever had. An unassuming place that's easy to miss, this eatery is located in the back of the Park Place Pub. Don't let the location dissuade you. This is not bar food. These guys are dishing out some seriously delicious food that's fresh and positively yummy. 

In addition to the amazing burgers, the onion rings and fries are also blow your mind great. 

So, if you feel like giving your diet the middle finger for one meal and scarfing down some really good food, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM.  Applewood Smoke Burger Company is a great find in Highland Park.  You would never find it if you aren't looking for it in the back of Park Place Pub on Bryant.  We went on a Saturday Night at prime burger time and there was not wait.  I had the Applewood burger and was perfectly cooked to a medium temperature.  My boyfriend got the Farmhouse also cooked to perfection.  The service was prompt and with a smile.  

There is a nice outside seating and the beer selection will compliment any item.  I am going to check it out again and have some wings.  There was a candied apple flavor that looked interesting.  

My tip for any newbies is check out the chalkboard menu, there are different items than the paper menu."}
{"text":"I was back from vacation less than 24 hours and looking for somewhere to grab a bite to eat.  Since I had just returned home, I had nothing to really eat and the thought of cooking was exhausting.  I looked through my Yelp bookmarks and Applewood Smoke Burger Company caught my eye.  A burger sounded really good.  I checked out the menu and thought, \"man, some wings would go really good with a burger\" but I didn't see them on the menu online.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers I quickly discovered that yes, they do in fact have wings.  Sold!

I have to thank my fellow Yelpers again for letting me know that Applewood Smoke Burger Company is not a storefront but is a food counter in the back of Park Place Pub.  After I parked and walked up to Park Place Pub, I could see the burger menu posted in the window.  It's easy to miss if you're not looking for it.

I made my way to the counter and placed my order to go.  I started with some wings (Sweet Chipotle Dust).  I had been eyeing up the Bleu Fries (fries with bacon and bleu cheese) but didn't necessarily want a full order.  So I ordered up a BYOBurger and asked if I could upgrade my side of fries to the Bleu Fries - this was not a problem.  I kept my burger order simple with cheddar cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo and ketchup.  They had a few other orders ahead of mine but the Penguins playoff game was about to start so I had no problem waiting at the bar with a beer while I waited for my to-go order.  The service was helpful and friendly (and patient as I couldn't make up my mind on my burger choice).  The girl who took my order said she would bring out my order to me when it was ready.  I think I was still out of there within 15 minutes and my entire order was under $20.  Even the Park Place Pub bartender was friendly and nice. 

That could have been the longest 20 minute drive home ever.  I put the food in my trunk hoping I wouldn't be tortured with the smell.  That didn't work so well.  When I finally arrived home, I tore into those wings something fierce.  That Sweet Chipotle Dust (a dry rub) had the perfect amount of sweet and heat for me (i.e. not too much of either but the right amount of both).  The side of Bleu Fries was just the right size (and covered with a surprising about of cheese and bacon).  And that burger...well, let's just say it probably didn't really need anything on it.  The bun was toasted and the burger was cooked a nice medium as ordered.  I may have chewed it, I may have swallowed it whole.  I don't really remember because after that first bite I was on a cloud in burger heaven.

I think it's safe to say I'll be back another time to eat in and catch another game.  Park Place Pub is a very welcoming place and a nice home for Applewood Smoke Burger Company."}
{"text":"I sooo love getting to cross Yelp bookmarked places off my list and I love even more when Yelp points me in the right direction!!  I don't get burgers ever, but I was totally craving one a couple Sunday's ago and I am happy we decided to try this place.  As other reviewers mentioned, it's hidden in the back of Park Place Pub and you go up to a counter in the back of the establishment to order food.  There are a few tables along the wall, but we decided to sit at the bar to eat.  When we walked in, there was a woman sitting at the end of the bar that I assumed was the bartender, but when I smiled at her she just looked at me blankly so then I thought maybe she was just a patron having a drink.  Once we sat down to wait for our food, said woman did come over and mix our drinks.  She was attentive but not warm and fuzzy. That's fine. We were unbothered and were sipping on our very reasonably priced drinks.  Our food came out about 20 minutes later and was delivered to us by the really sweet girl that took our food order.  The burgers looked AMAZING!!!

They do offer quite a large variety of burgers and other bar foods - wings, chicken sandwiches and salads plus a couple different kind of fries and sides to add to the order.  I went with the burger that had a fried egg and bacon on it with sweet potato fries and Bobby ordered the bison burger with the Cajun fries.  I am no burger connoisseur, but this burger was so juicy, perfectly cooked and had an amazing texture.  I will say it could use a little seasoning in the meat, but the sides and the chewy bun made up for it for me.  Bobby said his was really good, but not the best he's ever had.  My sweet potatoes were quite overdone, but I ate them anyway and the Cajun fries were perfect.

We stayed for a few more drinks and decided we would definitely be back to grab a bite and hang out and watch a game.  Cute little neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"I've had multiple burgers here and they are all amazing. Definitely top 3 burger joint in Pittsburgh and extremely underrated. Skip BRGR and come here."}
{"text":"Saw this place on the rise in the top ranked places for food in Pittsburgh so I came here to give it a try. When I arrived, I was a bit confused as to where the place was. For those who've never been here before, the joint is located in the back of a pub called Park Place Pub. You go into the pub and the joint is located in the back. Now, onto the menu. The joint sells specialty burgers (there are also a few on the chalkboard in the place not listed on the joint's official menu), build-your-own, sides (fries, potato fries, onion rings, etc.), chicken sandwiches, salads, desserts, drinks, and veggie options. I ended up going with the Bison Burger along with its included side of fries and added an order of onion rings to go. The burger itself? Fantastic. I could tell that I was chomping into a great quality patty the minute my mouth met the insides of the patty. It was not only juicy, but full of flavor and just a great tasting patty on par with Burgatory and BRGR if not better. Fries here were also great, crisp and freshly made. The onion rings were good as well, especially that horseradish sauce that really made the onion rings stand out as a side on its own. In general, great burger joint definitely worth checking out. I'll have to try some of the other choices on a future visit."}
{"text":"I was rather pleased with my Applebutter BBQ Burger. I'm one of those \"well-done\" burger people (don't hate!), and my burger from Applewood was still juicy despite my preferred temperature. Plus, the toppings were ample and the burger had a lot of flavor. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Holy crap does this place have awesome burgers!!! Go now! I have the Applewood BBQ burger and hubby had the Bayou Burger. The bbq sauce on mine was amazing. Both were cooked to our preference which never really happens anywhere else. They always ask how you want your burger but most places never get it right. There is minimal indoor seating which is the downside and it's really loud because they share space with a bar, but the food...oh the food!!'"}
{"text":"Ok,I gave it a 4 stars based on the fact that the signature burger ,The Applewood was very good. The service was great the guys who waited on us were very nice and helpful, they had no problem kind of guiding you through the menu. I kind of wish they had their own restaurant; It is located in the back of Park Place Pub and there is no sign outside that I could see. So they lost one star for that and that alone. That being said ,i understand you have to start some where, so when you get your own place make sure it is well lit, people like to see their food.  I recommend  you try their burgers you won't  be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very delicious burgers, onion rings were no joke either.  Very kind staff.

We went in on a Sunday afternoon, ordered, watch the game and enjoyed some very delicious food"}
{"text":"I am not usually mislead from my fellow yelpers, but both my husband and I were disappointed with this visit..

Like other reviews, there is no signage for the place. It is actually labeled the Park Pub(?) if I remember correctly.. When we walked in, the place was empty except for one person at the bar and another couple eating at a table. 

We walked to the back to order. The waitress was friendly and gave us some recommendations. I ordered the farm house burger and my husband ordered the stacker(?) and added grilled mushrooms. We also ordered the buffalo garlic wings to start.

For no one being there (the girl at the bar was actually the bar tender and the couple eating had left shortly after we ordered) the service was molasses. Once the wings came out, they were pretty tasty. The burgers came out as we were finishing the wings. The burger and fries looked good, but something was off. I didn't really like the bun (hubby did), the egg was greasy, the bacon was pretty limp, and the burger over all was bland. The French fries were just ok. I've had worse, but I've also had better. The place over all smelled like old fryer grease which was also a big turn off.

2 stars? Yeah, the wings were decent, but the service was slow, the bar tender was inattentive, place had a greasy smell, and the burger just wasn't good."}
{"text":"Went here after a trip to the zoo, the burgers are delicious. Tried the bayou burger and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you want a great burger and beer this is the place!  I love places that you can see the kitchen and this has to be the cleanest kitchen I've seen!  This translates into a burger that is delicious, fresh and juicy."}
{"text":"Discovered this place when a friend and I were looking for somewhere new to try, and I'm so glad we did!

I got the Applewood BBQ burger (I believe that's what it's called) and it was FANTASTIC. It came with fries, and the service was friendly.

A note about this place: it's inside Park Place Pub. You order your food all the way at the back, then sit and order drinks in the pub. Kind of nice if you're looking to have some alcohol with your meal.

I'll definitely be going back and recommending this to friends and family. Great, affordable burgers in a small-town pub."}
{"text":"BRGR? Burgatory? Stack'd? Nah. Applewood Smoke.

Highland Park residents are among the luckiest since this hidden treasure (located inside Park Place Pub) serves up one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh. 

Order and pay first, then find a seat at one of the tables in Park Place Pub, or take a seat on the patio out back when the weather allows.

My burgers are always cooked to order perfectly, and I haven't had a burger on the menu that I didn't absolutely love. Most likely because these burger wizards are masters of the burger-making craft.

If you haven't given them a chance, do yourselves a favor and put a trip to Applewood Smoke on the agenda."}
{"text":"If you ever want a truly amazing burger, this is the place. Each of the menu burgers are great, but you can always create your own. The fries and onion rings are great. There's a full bar to the side with a good selection of beer. Order more rare than you prefer because they come more thoroughly cooked."}
{"text":"Make a trip to Highland Park after reading all the reviews last Wednesday. My gal was home from college and loves a good burger.  Got there when they open at 5:00.... walked to the back of the pub to then only see that they are closed u til January 3rd.  Nothing noted on their FB site or anything.  With the week between the holidays being prime restaurant time in the burg....we were disappointed. At least post a notice on your FB page .....we may try again but not good communication."}
{"text":"Ok so here's the deal. This place could be so great, but unfortunately I can't give it a four or five stars because it's just not worth it. My wife got the Applebutter BBQ, which was delicious. The fries that came with it were crispy and good, but nothing amazing. Personally, Five Guys' fries are better. This is where the good news stops. I got the Applewood burger, which sounded amazing with Gouda cheese, apple slices, and applewood bacon. However, while the burger itself was cooked well and had good seasoning, the rest of it overall was pretty bland tasting. I was hoping the apples would give good flavor, but it was pretty pedestrian. You really couldn't taste the cheese or apples. Again though, the BBQ burger was delish!

The restaurant is hard to find because it is part of the Park Place Pub, which you don't know until you get there. This means you have to buy your food at the counter, then if you want drinks (of any kind) you have to purchase them separately from the bar. Two purchases for one meal. 

What this place has going for it in delicious burger, it lacks in presentation and atmosphere. Also, there's nothing really in the way of kids food. I got grilled cheese and mini-burgers for my kids for $8 each (seems a bit much to me). 

I'll probably order from here for takeout when I'm jonesing for a craft burger locally, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Why isn't everyone talking about this place?! This was without a doubt the BEST burger I have ever had. I ordered the Applewood and it was to die for. Their onion rings are equally as perfect. Love the casualness of this place, and the back deck. We had a great night eating burgers and drinking blue moons outside! Can't wait to come back again and again."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous!  I randomly happened upon it while getting a beer at Park Place Pub (the burger joint is located at the back of the bar).

Menu contains a large variety of craft burgers as well as a build your own option. Menu includes a few salads and wings options too!

Seating is somewhat limited, so be prepared to potentially have to take it to go or eat outside if the bar is particularly crowded (most days it's not).

Prices are fair and the results of their efforts are delicious. Big, juicy, flavorful burgers!!! Way better than BRGR or Burgatory in my opinion!! Oh and those fries are done to perfection--not always found around these parts!"}
{"text":"Attempted to check this place out on a Friday night. The address listed is the same as the Park Place Pub. There was no sign anywhere (that I could see) indicating that this burger joint existed. My hubby and I even ventured into the pub to see if the place was inside, but we quickly left after the smell of stale smoke greeted us."}
{"text":"Really good burgers, only giving this a 4 because 1. Parking is so hard to find and 2. The difficulty of understanding the system of ordering (going to the back of the bar ordering etc)... Also no menus to take home and pretty hard to find a menu that I am able to read online."}
{"text":"Literally as good as it gets! So thankful that I tried this place, it just took over the top spot on my Best Pittsburgh Burger list. Seriously, perfection. 

It was a little hard to find. Not marked well. Park Place Pub is the right spot, don't get deterred by the lack of signage. It's located in the back of the bar. It's a separate business in the same room and you're welcome to grab drinks from the bar, which makes it even better. A nice cold draft beer and delicious burger. Does it get any better? Super casual vibes, two big TVs at each end of the bar, and a really great local hangout feel.

I had the Bison Burger... (because there is no better burger than a bison burger) and sweet potato fries. My entire group loved their meal and we ALL plan on returning soon. They also had wings, vegetarian options, salads, and side options. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Omg crazy good! Best burger I've had in a very long time. Generous burger patty, perfectly cooked to order. Super nice people working here."}
{"text":"The burger was delicious! I was able to substitute a bun for lettuce and have a side salad. Only complaint was had to wait a bit for the food and it didn't seem that busy, but the taste of the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try the burgers.  You won't be disappointed.  The burger is thick and tasty.  Cooked perfectly.  The burgers are thick so it does take about 15 minutes to cook, so don't expect McD's yawl.  Had the Blues Burger which includes bacon, a great combination with tasty bacon, blue cheese and great burger.  We also ordered some Cajun wings.  The wings had a crispy skin but lacked flavor,  needed more Cajun dust.  

As others have mentioned, Applewood is in the back of Park Place Pub so you can get a beer from the Pub.  There is seating outside on some tables in the lot and patio in the back."}
{"text":"This place is hidden but worth looking. It's a nondescript bar where you can find one of the best, fresh burgers in the city. The prices are reasonable and there's no wait. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with the hubby and a friend. First of all,  if you haven't been here before you are going to the Park Place Pub and the restaurant is in the back of the bar. 

Each of us ordered the Applewood signature burger with smoked gouda and apples on it. Though we all ordered a different doneness in the dimness of the restaurant it was difficult to tell if they were perfectly cooked,  but they were so juicy and delicious it almost didn't matter. 

The fries were well cooked and seasoned and delicious, but if you like onion rings I definitely suggest and order of them. They were large and fresh and lightly battered with a delicious horseradish sauce. 

I personally thought that the drink ordering was a little strange. At the back part of the bar where the \"restaurant\"  is you can only order a few things like Mexican Coke,  IBC root beer and other bottled drinks,  but you can order regular sodas and drinks at the bar. 

I can't wait to go back and try more burgers!"}
{"text":"Great burgers.... Like seriously one of the best I ever had. The ground beef tasted unbelievable and I got the sweet potato fries. They were awesome as well. I eat all over the country and this place is in my top 5 burger joints in the world!
They are located inside of Park Place Pub bar. It's in the back of the bar... I agree there could be better signage but the person who gave them a negative review without tasting the food is just wrong! Lots a none smoking bar!
This is s must try place!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Burgers, the best in the area. It's inside of Park Pub Place, their food is awesome."}
