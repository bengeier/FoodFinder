{"text":"This place should be renamed crappy jade. Horrible horrible service with only mediocre food. No waiter or hostess wanted to help us after waiting ONE HOUR for food. Will never eat here again!!"}
{"text":"One thing to note and get over with: the service sucks.  Don't expect too much. In fact, I strongly suggest you tip them badly (if at all) and tell them so that they would change.  Now that we got over that, let's get to the meat of it: the food. This is an above average Chinese restaurant that actually serves authentic Chinese food. None of that chicken ball and other Chinese-American monstrosities that select places offer.  The kicker for Happy Jade are their daily specials. My favourite in particular is Tuesday's Steamed Tilapia for $7.99 I believe. That is a steal when other restaurants offer them for twice or more of that price. It is done well with a delicious sauce and cooked just right."}
{"text":"Friday lunch time. Me and the office crew head over to try this place out. Not too busy.  The ordering sheet and the picture menu didn't jive, so it was a little tricky picking out exactly what we wanted. The food was definitely sub-par compared to what I've tried in Chinatown in Toronto.  There are serving staff and wait staff. While one of the servers was depositing more food on our table, I requested more tea. She told me I would have to speak to the waiter. Really?  The price was fair. Five guys, lunch, $74 after tax."}
{"text":"I love the food here, especially the lobster ! I think its a good price but everyone tells me its a good price because its probably low quality, but I don't care its still delicious and the staff is always nice to us so they're all good in my books, the only thing I would change is the level of cleanliness I see some dust bunnies in the corners and I hate that but that's all I can complain about"}
{"text":"Yuck!!  I have vowed never to eat dim sum ever again!!   The food seemed over cooked possibly reheated, there was a foreign substance in my steamed custard bun and it was super greasy.    Plus side:  the food is dirt cheap."}
{"text":"The Chinese owner that behind the cash machine is an idiot. We had dinner in this place before and the waiter and waitress were good. Once we brought a frozen fish to this place and a waiter recommended a cooking method and we had a great meal. Today we brought a lingcod there and I asked if they can cook it with chilly bean sauce (Northern Chinese food style) ? The owner told me they don not cook it. While I was talking to one of his waiters (the one that help us last time when we brought a fish to this place) and figure out a cooking method that this restaurant can cook, the owner came over and stupidly repeating himself that they do not cook northern food. I asked him to stop repeating and he still continued. I told him no problem if he does want our business, we don't have to eat here. He said it would be fine as he has fish. We went to another Chinese restaurant at night and had a wonderful 3 course meal out of the 8 lbs lingcod. There are many people fishing on their own and bring their catch to restaurants. The owner of this restaurant appears to be ignorant about this fact. We would never go back to this place again. Not because of the waiters and waitress there, but because of the idiotic owner!"}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost due to unsanitary reasons. Ordered fried rice and discovered that there's was a piece of meat heavily deep fried with legs and a head. Trying to determine if it was a fly...looks like one.  My brother went to the bathroom then came back and he couldn't eat anything afterward.  Major upset stomach during the night for the family, also.  Cranky waiter and waitress, not happy to be there.  Hence, please avoid going here!!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to find a good chinese restaurant in mississauga. after trying all the different ones, i am so excited i finally found this one! Our family went there last night, their food is cheap and tastes good. also, the seafood is very fresh. the only problem is there were too many people there and the service was a bit slow. will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"average chinese food but bad service.  ordered a chicken noodle dish and sweet and sour pork.  came fast but the sweet and sour pork was overly sour and soggy.  asked the waiter to replace the pork dish because it was very bad and he became all defensive.  he refused saying that it is how all the other places make it.  he refused to even try it before saying there was nothing wrong with the dish.  would not go back again."}
{"text":"Been here since I was young, we don't go as much. Their soup, which is free during dinnertime, is usually very good, as are their desserts.  Dim Sum is also decent and well-priced.  Although I gave this 3 stars I'd say it's on the high end of 3; just your typical chinese restaurant (it is authentic most of the time)  Food is generally pretty good, but although I love many of the staff, one lady came out and yelled at us (in Cantonese I believe) after we sent back an order (she knew we were regulars too.)"}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant every now and then - so sorta a regular. The restaurant does consistently have good, authentic Chinese food. I find the pricing quite reasonable for Chinese food and if you have dinner, it comes with Chinese soup which not all Chinese restuarants give. They have specials for dinner for every day of the week and also weekly specials (such as the lobster I got - $26.99 for twin lobsters which was a great price and tasted great!). My favourite dish is called \"choi pong hai\" which is basically broccoli surrounding an egg white-scallop mixture. Delish!  No qualms about service - they are friendly, owner is very laid back and you can tell they are not the type of restaurant that would rush you out or give you pretentious attitude. I find they are not busy on weekdays, however, so it'll most likely be a quiet evening with a few tables.  This restaurant also offers dim sum for lunch as well (in my opinion at a much more reasonable price and some items are decent quality). I would recommend going on a weekend as it would be more busy and so there is greater selection and fresher. It's not Emerald in terms of the hustle and bustle, but it's still good dim sum in its own right.  P.S. I noticed they recently updated their wallpaper and carpet I think, which was nice and made the place brighter."}
{"text":"Okay experience. Food was decent, but is overpriced for such a small portion given. I particularly enjoy dim sum, but I've been reducing my trips to this restaurants simply because of the price."}
{"text":"I'm a very fussy, very picky eater.   I'm usually don't go very far out of my comfort zone, burgers, chicken fingers etc.  I am however endevouring to be a bit more open to new choices.   So my friend talked me into trying dim sum.   I was a bit hesitant, but was assured I could manage to find stuff I liked with out being forced to eat vegtables.   I must say I was very impressed.   There is alot to choose from for a picky eater, I am not a huge fan of every dish I tried, but that has more to do with my taste in food then the quality.   My friend who eats a lot of Dim Sum was very impressed.   So outside of the food, the atmosphere was very bright which was nice, as some chinese food resturants, especially in small plaza's can be dingy.   We arrived just after 11 on a Sunday morning,  and it seemed to be quiet and relaxing,  and then the crowds started to come in,  it got loud, but it wasn't overwhelming.  The staff was mostly cheerful, and helpful, and didn't look at me funny when I asked for a knife and fork,  I know I will work on the chopsticks, but can't quite get the hang of them.   Price wise it seemed to me to be very reasonable, we tried 7 or 8 dishes, were quite filled and it was only $25."}
{"text":"Decent Dim Sum selection, not my favorite place to go, but it's close to work, and never as busy as the other Dim Sums in Mississauga. Greatly priced, good service."}
{"text":"10 years back we used to come here during the week with work colleagues for dim sum.  Came on a Sunday afternoon at 12:30pm.  Was busy but didn't have to wait for a table.  I recognize the same wait staff and I think the owner's still the same.  It's been over a year since I came here.  Dim sum came out in fits and starts.  One of the dim sum cart ladies seriously looked like she was working post late night drinking binge.  She looked like she was fighting a serious hangover headache and wasn't saying a word, just opening lids and standing there.  Come on, really?!?!    Har gow was okay.  They gave us watered down chili sauce, really? That's where you want to cheap out on hot sauce that costs $2/ bottle at the Asian grocery store?? Stuffed eggplant was ice cold.  Deep fried squid tasted like it was fried twice.  The other shrimp and veggie dumplings were good.  Bean curd wrapped stuffed meat dish was good.  Sticky rice dumpling was okay.  Tofu dessert was good.  There were long periods when the same cart just kept circling.  They seemed to avoid the middle aisle where we sat.  Hello!!! Over here please!!! Some other stuff started coming out when we were leaving.  This place was much better 5+ years ago.  There is so little to pick from in Mississauga.  Emerald wasn't so good a couple of months back.   It was cheap - Where else can 4 have dim sum for $38 incl tax?"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Chinese restaurant whether it's for dim sum, dinner or super late night munchies. I always make sure to order chicken and salted fish fried rice and/or fried squid tentacles if I'm having dim sum. I can go on forever listing all of my favourites here but that would be almost the whole menu! Gotta give this place a try, if you haven't already"}
{"text":"Most people do Easter with turkey and stuffing and all those fixins - what do we do? That's right: Chinese Dim Sum! After reading many reviews I figured we'd try Happy Jade since my grandmother is slowly becoming an agoraphob in her old age and dragging her down to Mississauga China Town wasn't an option.   We hit HJ around 11am because I heard there was some sort of morning rush (starting promptly at 11:30am it was a zoo) and were seated promptly although it took asking 3 servers to finally get a high chair.   Next time in retrospect we'll ask for a table by the wall so that when the kid plays with chopsticks (read: makes giant stabbing motions in the air) he won't skewer the person behind us which he did about 6 times.  The food though was pretty fresh and plentiful - once they figured out that we actually knew a thing or two about dim sum (and that the kid was shoving har gow into his trap faster than they could put it on our table) the food was flowing. They even had a few things that I haven't seen passed around at the other dim sum restaurants I've been to recently.   All in all for 4 people and a hungry toddler the bill came out to just under $50 which is pretty good considering how much we ate. Check this place out - and if you see a shumai go whizzing over your head - not gonna lie, that's probably my kid practicing his chopstick ninja moves."}
{"text":"We went here for Christmas  eve hoping for a nice family holiday meal. Instead, we had a horrible experience at this place. We had an order for 5-6 dishes and only the fried rice came out, 45 minutes after we placed our order! Ridiculous. The restaurant kept telling us it was busy yet the place was half full and every other table was getting their food, including people who arrived AFTER us. We decided to leave after waiting for over an hour. We were kind enough to leave them $20 for fried rice, the people there didn't seem to care we were leaving and never apologized or anything. An absolutely horrible experience. These people need to learn the basics of customer service. We went to Best Friend down the street instead and had an excellent experience. Mainly, we got the food we ordered in a decent amount of time! Shame on Happy Jade!"}
{"text":"The Happy Jade Seafood is now permanently closed"}
{"text":"This place was suddenly closed last weekend when we went - not sure if due to sanitation issues. However, I would not be surprised if that was the case because recently when I was eating there, a preserved dead wasp dropped down from the air conditioning vent in the ceiling and onto our table right in front of my plate. Sadly, we still continued to eat here after that because of the lack of dim sum options in Mississauga. Also, this place is cheap after 2:00PM.   If you are planning to visit, I recommend you call before going to make sure they are even open for business."}
{"text":"Are you looking for a decent Chinese dinner filled with flavourful meats and seafood for a large group of people? Well, for $108 CAD, you can get an 8-10 person meal special, and I went here for another family gathering. It definitely helps if you know some Cantonese Chinese and can read a decent amount of Chinese characters. If you do not, well, I could try to help you order this special, or can suggest some dishes from the special.   The special is called the Luk Yuk Chan Pang Yin. I guess, after looking at the Chinese characters, it roughly translates to Green Jade Intimate Friend's Feast. It has nine dishes, mainly seafood dishes, which includes lobster, fish, tofu, vegetables and pork chops. It also comes with a large seafood soup. I also have a picture of what details of the meal special has in Traditional Chinese.   The seafood soup was a pretty good appetizer and it had a somewhat rich warmness. The Pork Chops they serve here are doused in a lemon flavoured sauce, and I thought the texture was pretty good with a nice sweetness. The lobster dish in the meal special was not bad, not the best lobster that I had in Ontario, but still good with a nice tenderness. As for the fish dishes, they were pretty good. There's one dish, called the Bik Luk Chao Ban Kau, which are these fish fillets with Chinese vegetables that are stir fried. The fish had a nice softness and the vegetables had a decent flavour. Another fish dish they have is the Ching Jing Wu Chung Sin, which is this steamed lake fish. It's freshly cooked, and it's best eaten when it is served. The texture was also good, but be prepared to take out a lot of bones.   The service is not the best service that you will get, so do not expect speedy service. This is more like a place to relax and eat a long dinner as the sun sets.   Overall, if I am ever in Mississauga with a large group of people, and if I need a restaurant that could feed them, I would probably take them to this place. I don't think it is the best Chinese restaurant in Mississauga, but I think they can do a decent job in serving a big meal for a lot of people. I am not sure if I want to come back here again, but I would not mind coming back for more Chinese style fish dishes. Was I really happy after I ate at this place? My hungry stomach was fairly happy, so yes."}
{"text":"Went for Dim Sum yesterday and even though my friend and I are sort of novices we had a good time. The food was fresh and the cart ladies did a decent job of helping us pick through the offerings."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever received!! I will never come back again. The food is ok, but the service really destroyed the meal mood."}
{"text":"2.5*  Preface:  I hate dim sum in the GTA.  If you've been to HK, you'll understand what I mean.  At least in 'ssauga, it's pretty mediocre, re-steamed/fried, oily/MSG-ridden, and not all that cheap.  Anyway, as soon as I was seated, I had to go to the washroom and as per my pics, I didn't have the best overall impression of the restaurant.  The washrooms were pretty clean, but the sign about putting your toilet paper in the garbage bin??!!  Gross.  That's what they did when I went to China...10 years ago and the stall would smell like stale urine.  Thankfully, I don't think anyone listened to the sign 'cause it didn't smell!  The hallway leading to the restrooms was also a sight.  Not necessarily unsanitary, but just a lot of clutter and perhaps breaking some fire codes.  Food-wise it was just ok, nothing memorable.  Edible, but didn't taste as fresh as it would abroad.  Definitely re-steamed, but not rotten.  Custard tarts were pretty good.  Beef ribs were gristly and a bit oily.  I think if I hadn't seen all that clutter + sign in the stalls, I'd have a better impression of the food."}
{"text":"Food here is of course really good. Although, I wouldn't recommend having dimsum because they charge so much for a small serving. But please, do order everything else. Thank you. Hehe"}
{"text":"Garbage! Dirty! Bad Service!  Don't bother. Nothing special about this place. The food was just ok. I can cook better at home and the wait staff was cold and unfriendly. The restaurant wasn't very busy, which should have told us a lot for a Friday night. We were seated by the door and got a nice shot of icy cold air every time someone walked in or out.   We ordered shrimp and pork fried rice which was dry and seemed like it was sitting around since lunch time and some meat dish I cant remember, which came about 10 minutes before the rice. So we are sitting there with a plate of meat and nothing else, looking around like idiots, wondering if they forgot about our rice or what was going on. Not mention of when it will be out or if its even coming. Should have just went for pho somewhere else.  We did not get any complimentary Chinese soup but did see everyone else had it?   I will not go back here and would not recommend this place. It was NOT worth the price and I wish I hadn't tipped."}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoy dinners here. Their steam fish ia always fresh and done just right. 2 lobsters (1lbs each); green ginger and onion $26.99 is a great deal.  Flavorful and not too saucy like aome places.  Portions are good with their chow mein and fried rice.  They have some bbq set up where you can get chicken, pork or duck.  The place is not the most decorative and their washrooms in not so inviting... but I am there for their food.  The offer dim sum and after 2pm its half price on wknds."}
{"text":"Happy Jade was our favourite Dim Sum place for the last 15 yrs. It has been sold and is being renovated (badly needed). The new owners are supposed to reopen sometime in December. Happy Jade was the best dim sum in Mississauga for taste, quality, price and serving size. Service was good for a Chinese dim sum restaurant but not a lot of English spoken. Waiting to see how the food is when they reopen under new management."}
{"text":"There's not a whole lot of choices for dim sum in Etobicoke/Mississauga besides Sam Woo, Emerald, Tremendous, and the restaurant formerly known as Sun Sun. So when we get tired of those ones, we cycle back to Happy Jade.  We hadn't been to back to Happy Jade for at least a year.  We were turned off previously because one of dim sum dishes (rice rolls with shrimps) had a very chemically taste.  We decided to give Happy Jade another chance for dim sum.  Arrived around 11:30am on a Saturday.  Restaurant was almost full and we were able to snag the last available table.    They have cart service so a few things that we got were cold by the time they arrived at our table (spring rolls, shrimp won tons, egg plants w/ shrimp).  But everything that passed in the steam carts were hot and fresh.  We didn't see congee so we ordered it directly from a waitress.  They have most of the standard dim sum fare except mango pudding.  They did have fresh wife cookies (lo po beng) that were amazing...still a bit warm, fluffy layers and a nice filling.    Cart ladies are quite friendly and most speak a bit of English but wait staff can be a bit difficult to flag down.  Also, they did not ask what kind of tea we would like.  Maybe because I was with the gwai lo they didn't think it would matter?  The dim sum is classified as S, M, L but not sure what the pricing was.  Most of the dishes fell into the M category.  Pricing for 2 smalls, 7 mediums and 2 large, plus the congee came to roughly $40.  So average pricing, not outrageous.  We will be back for those fresh lo po beng!"}
{"text":"If you wondered what a typical Chinese restaurant looks like come to Happy Jade. Many celebrations took place at this restaurant many years ago, such as birthdays and weddings. But it's pretty cheesy when you think about it.  My family and I arrived for dinner yesterday around 5:30 and it was pretty dead...well, it is only 5:30. We were seated right away and the waiter immediately asked for our order. Calm down, we just sat down. He was standing by our table just waiting for us to decide which made us feel rushed and didn't have enough time to carefully look at the menu.   We ordered a plate of lobster, pekking duck, and fried rice noodles with beef in soya sauce. The food came pretty quickly, one after the other. We thought the duck was way overpriced, which was around $32. All of the food was hot and tasted fresh, so no complaints there. They also gave us complimentary soup...more like a broth (which we didn't eat) and tofu for dessert.  This is random but the table cloths didn't match the restaurant at all. They were light purple and the main colours found in this restaurant are red and green.  Overall, the food is pretty good and I guess once in a while we'll drop by. It's not very close to our place so it's not very convenient to drive 20 minutes to eat here."}
