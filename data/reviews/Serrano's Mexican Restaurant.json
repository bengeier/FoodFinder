{"text":"I love this place.  Food and service are great.  Prices are very good.  Their red enchilada sauce IS the best in the valley, hands down.  Their salsa is great.  I love it, and am terribly sad that I have to move to S. Carolina where I'll be 2,000 miles away from that awesome enchilada sauce."}
{"text":"Yummm this is a really good food place and didn't know they've been here for 10 years what a gem we found."}
{"text":"In a world where anything but 5 stars is bad, this is 5 stars. In a world where 5 stars = incredible food, this is a solid 4-star spot.

Expansive menu, friendly service and excellent prices here. I had the cheese enchiladas (my baseline for Mexican places) and they were a bit bland but good. The chips and salsa are BOMB. After a few bites of the enchiladas, I covered them in salsa and NOM NOM NOM. 

They have fountain Coke products,which is a huge plus in my book.

I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Great food.. good prices.. Great service.. what's not to like.  Place was not fancy, but that is what i like.. especially in a town like vegas"}
{"text":"Great homemade Mexican food.  This place is family operated and the food taste authentic!  
This place is popular, the entire time we ate lots of people coming in and picking up orders.  It's a must try!"}
{"text":"I love the service here, the staff are respectful, pleasant and helpful. The pollo fundito is excellent, with big, juicy chunks of chicken instead of shredded."}
{"text":"Let's talk about the food. The only thing that got my pallet was the whole pinto beans, yum!  5 out of 10 on the enchiladas and rice, I don't like the box tasting rice. Service was good and friendly. Could use some deep cleaning!  Won't do again, unless I just wanted a bowl of whole beans."}
{"text":"We are from California and were looking for a good Mexican restaurant, this place is great, the food is really good and fresh, the service is very friendly, I had the chilaquiles and they were great, my fiancé had the carne asada plate, the meat were very tender and cooked to perfection. We are definitely coming back next time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is soooo much better than Pepe's, Roberto's. Environment is very subtle. Family owned. Good food! Great options. Try it!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here!  Very good.  I love the cheese enchiladas and the different varieties of salsa."}
{"text":"This place is the best Mexican food I've had so far in Vegas.  I moved here from San Diego and I've had plenty of Mexican food there, being so close to Tijuana and this place it great!  There is a little bit of wait, but thats because they make everything to order.  The food is good, the price is right and the salsa bar is amazing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They make there own chips. I have eaten at this place many times and have never been disappointed. I have tried their enchiladas, burritos and breakfast menu ."}
{"text":"Geared toward the gringo palate.  Fajitas not very well seasoned. Margaritas had a \"mix\" taste to them. Bean dip oniony but bland. 

Service was friendly and decent. :-)

Too many other Mexican places in the neighborhood to try."}
{"text":"I too originally came from Los Angeles and it's true, Serrrano's is the real thing. The staff is so friendly and everything tastes like home made. I just had their menudo and it was absolutely amazing, so tender just like growing up. Nothing like growing up with menudo and then pan dulce every Sunday."}
{"text":"Really good food.  Love the Machaca.  Great salsa and chips along with the bean dip  affordable and nice casual atmosphere"}
{"text":"Came back to the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Had the super chicken burrito. It was absolutely awesome!!! It was so big, I had to take a portion home. Excellent service, extremely nice people. Can't go wrong going here."}
{"text":"We decided to give it another try after going to the one on rural and Guadalupe a few years back. That was a horrible experience.  This time we went to Dobson and Guadalupe service was great food had really good flavor.  The following week I called in a to go order of the exact same thing we had ordered the last time. I was told they didn't give chips, salsa or bean dip with to go orders. She said she would have to charge me $3 each.  I was not happy with that considering its complimentary when you dine in. The person knew I was not happy. When I went to pick up my order I was presently surprised there were chips, beans and salsa in my bag. Unfortunately I was disappointed when I got home and one of the orders was a burrito and it was cold on the inside. I had ordered the tortilla soup and the Pillow Ranchers. The soup was delicious with large chunks of white meat chicken and tasted wonderful. I opened up the pollo ranchero and there was 5 small pieces of chicken with some sauce over it. I had more chicken in my soup than in my meal. I called to complain and asked for the manager. April the manager go on the phone with a little bit of an attitude. I proceeded to tell her my name (Toni) to tell her about my positive encounter with having chips and salsa in my order without charging me. She immediately said \"who gave you that without charging you?\" I continued to tell her what was wrong with my order and was not happy. She looked up my order which was under a different name. She asked again who gave me the chips I told her the young ladies name. April then said \"Danielle what do you want me to do for you? I told her my name was not Danielle it was Toni. She was rude and acted as if I was wrong for complaining. Forward to this past Friday night. We had a friend over who wanted to order to go. I was hesitant but went ahead and ordered. This time I paid the crazy amount for the \"complimentary\" chips, salsa and beans $9. ? Ordered the soup that was so good the last two times this time it was bland hardly any chicken and mostly broth.  The inconsistency of this place is ridiculous and will be sure to let everyone know."}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot for lunch or dinner. I had the tamale, chicken enchilada, and chile relleno. Everything was so good."}
{"text":"I literally downloaded Yelp just so I could write a review. I'm new to the area, and didn't realize it's more of a midwestern US version of Mexican food- perhaps popular with retirees, but disgusting to a lover of real Mexican food. The beans are from a can, the salsa isn't picoso, and the steak fajitas are gross. They taste salty and from bad cuts of meat. The meat obviously wan't marinated, flame grilled, nor even fried. There was no crispness nor taste to it whatsoever. It tastes like it was frozen in a bag, and was cut in odd, long, 8 inch strips. The waiter seemed really fake, but attentive. I would have mentioned it to management, but living in Arizona they have to realize their cuisine is far from Mexican."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Messed up our order twice and took 45 minutes to get our food."}
{"text":"A complete waste of money. My family and I just got food from here last night and the food tasted like it was made the day before and the prices are outrageous especially when I can go right p the street to Tia Rosa's which is better quality food for half the price."}
{"text":"I grew up coming here for Mexican food for 10 years before we moved from Mesa to downtown Phoenix. I just moved back to the east valley and decided to bring my wife and daughter here tonight to see the Mexican food I grew up on. It was such an embarrassment to bring them here tonight. We ate about 5:30PM and were one of three couples there to eat so you would expect excellent customer service. All the staff was gathered down the hallways chatting and were impossible to get any service from. I had to get up twice to get someone's attention for a refill and then when we were ready to go there was no one around to get me the check... My wife had to get up and go to the circle of workers hanging out talking to get our check. Not to mention the food was horrible tonight. My burro had a dry tortilla and my rice was cold to the touch. I have never seen such horrible customer service at an establishment especially when they are empty!"}
{"text":"Their food is really good, service is great and prices are very reasonable. This is a must go everybody :)"}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever experience I've had and I've been coming to Serrano for years. First they forgot the lemon then they got my and my grandmas order wrong the whole time the server was rude from the beginning. They couldn't understand I asked for chicken as a substitute or nothing and gave me ground beef then remade it into something completely different. Server and manager are rude and incompetent. We were here for so long for them to remake food and still expected us to pay full price. Never again"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to a couple of Serrano's in the area and our favorite is in Queens Creek. The Mesa is like a whole different restaurant. It was not busy when we entered today at 3:38 pm. The hostess acted like we were ghosts waited for a bit and eventually asked if we wanted a table, we decided on the bar area and seated ourselves. We waited 7 to 10 minutes for a bartender to finally get back to the bar area, no wonder no one was there in the bar. Had one diluted down margarita each and left. Won't be back to this one at all. It's amazing what good help can do for the sucess or failure of a business."}
{"text":"I could eat just their chips and salsa and bean dip for an entire meal. In fact I have on several occasions. It's the best salsa and bean dip north of mexico. Eat it. Drink it. Order some other food and tip your waitstaff."}
{"text":"My family has been eating at this location since they opened. When somebody says \"Mexican food?\", we really mean \"Serrano's?\". Over the years the salsa bowls have shrunk in size and the newer menus are not as great, but the quality of the food and the customer service are always top notch. Stand out is the Chicken Serrano's Special Quesadilla. Ask for 2 or 3 bowls of their excellent salsa and cover the quesadilla in spicy goodness. Crispy chicken tacos are always dependably good. Not big into bean dip but everyone I bring here raves about it."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite Mexican food in the city. Been there a few times, and the food has always been great. 
    No exaggeration, their flan is truly the most delicious I've ever had. If you go here, don't forget that flan. 
   Large portions, and great service make this a great place to go. It's even nicely decorated. 
   My girlfriend and I have a 2 year old daughter, who can be very fussy at times. And the cashier here even hid the suckers from her view so she would stop fussing about them."}

            When I pulled in to the parking lot of Serrano's Mexican Food I saw a few other businesses, but it was a pretty empty and quiet lot. I didn't smell anything approaching the restaurant; it actually looked like a little hidden. However, when I opened the door, I immediately smelled fresh tortilla chips.  As I walked in to the clean and organized restaurant, I felt at home. I was looking for good authentic Mexican food and I came to the right spot. They have many pictures and historical memories of Mexico. This Ma and Pa restaurant is operated on a daily basis by the whole family. You can tell by the customer service they provide, that they are proud of their accomplishment. 
Food Evaluation
 After exploring the menu for a little bit, I chose to try Camarones al Mojo de Ajo. This is a shrimp dish sautéed in a garlic butter sauce. This dish was beyond delicious, I was asked if I wanted it to be spicy, of course I said yes. Everything is cooked to order, they pay close attention to detail and will personalize your order as best as they can. When my dish came out, it was vibrant, immediately looked appetizing, and definitely smelled garlicky and spicy. As I went to taste it, the combination of the shrimp with the garlic was strong but not potent, it was just perfect. The texture was tender, cooked to the right consistency, and the rice and beans on the side balanced out the sauce of the shrimp. This dish was just simply amazing, they also offered tortillas on the side, and I caught myself dipping the tortilla in the sauce more than once. That is how good it was, I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant. 
Serrano's Mexican Food 136 S Rainbow Blvd. LV. NV. 89145 June 28, 2017"}
{"text":"Not the same quality food... Is there new owners?  The Shredded Beef Chimi was lacking  filling.  The taco meat was good, but the shell was cooked different. Chincy on the beans, rice  and cheese. The best part is the salsa, especially their version on \"HOT\".  Bill was $32.00  with tip, for three orders.  Free  chips."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food.! The staff was very polite and friendly. It is located about 5 miles away from the strip."}
{"text":"This is the first time this place let me down. Come here regularly but tonight was the worst. Cold food and the waitress was absent most the time."}
{"text":"Better than average. Like many Mexican restaurants,  we were quickly served complimentary chips and salsa after ordering, which is kind of like the cover of a book or a first impression. The salsa verde was tangy and slightly spicy, just how a green salsa should be in my opinion, but the red salsas were kind of watery and not great. My chile relleno was nicely charred and tasty but the rice and beans were pretty status quo. My companion was happy to be able to order menudo and thought it was good. The service was very good,  quick and attentive. Anyway, I'd go back if I'm in the area and hungry but won't be driving out of the way to eat here."}
{"text":"The service is horrible here. Staff is nice but whoever is in charge needs more training on how to run a restaurant. The only reason I keep coming back is because my kid likes this place otherwise I'd never come back here again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexican restaurant. Their salsa makes me want to fuck everyone in the kitchen. I'm in love for real.."}
{"text":"I just found my new go to Mexican Restaurant. This place has been around for a long time and I still can't figure out why I haven't been here before. It is a little mother and daughter run place and they put their heart and soul into everything they make and do. It's not fancy and it is in a under stated shopping center. Everything on the menu is recognizable and filled with goodness. I always judge a new Mexican restaurants I try by their chili rellenos and they have one of the best. Their menu is like going home to family and eating."}
{"text":"It's a great Family Owned Bissiness the Mexican food is the Best in Town . The Family Hospitality is heart warming. My Favorites are the Green Chili Verde Burrito rice and beans on the side, and there Deserts are the best."}
{"text":"Okay, it's an older restaurant and the decor is plain. But it's SUPER clean, the food is fresh, the portions are generous and the service is friendly and helpful. We eat here a couple of times a month for dinner. I always get the steak ranchero. It's like Mexican pepper steak and it's a spicy comfort food. Served with tortillas, rice and beans, it will fill you up for only $8. If you got the same thing anywhere else it would be twice as much. 
The chips are fresh, thick and homemade. They aren't super salty, which I love. The salsa bar is always super clean and homemade. I love the jalapeños with carrots and onions and the garbanzo beans. My mom likes the cactus salad and cucumber salad. And I always get the hot salsa from the bar because the one they bring with the chips is pretty mild and I like some heat. Again, everything on the salsa bar is house made and delish!
Family run, they know us now which makes you feel like part of the family too. This isn't a taqueria, it's a family Mexican restaurant and the difference shows in the quality and care."}
{"text":"Amazing service!  Unbelievably polite and fast service.  We called in with some questions and were explained everything about the menu. Food was so good, this place exceeded our expectations. We are definitely coming back and would recommend this place to everyone. Such a great family run vibe."}
{"text":"This place is awful.  Wanted Pork Quesadillas but was told they don't make them even though it was on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Stop after the chips and bean dip. There's nothing else on the menu worth ordering. Whatever mojo this place once had is gone. The bussers are using smelly rags. The food is not original or even tasty."}
{"text":"My family and I ordered food to go last night and it was very disappointing. We ordered a shrimp quesadilla for my 3 year old with cheese and shrimp only... but there were onions and tomatoes in it (I'm assuming their Pico de gallo) which didn't go over well with him. My boyfriends cheese enchiladas were cold, the cheese wasn't even melted and the green sauce lacked any flavor. I ordered a plain chicken chimichanga and the chicken was so spicy I could barely eat it. The guacamole lacked flavor and our \"side of salsa\" was non existent... not sure if they gave us used salsas or they legitimately think this is a side of salsa. 
All in all the woman on the phone who took our order was friendly and the food was done in a timely manner and boxed and ready to go for pick up. But, We will probably never come back though!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Serrano's and we loved it.  My lady gave the shrimp burrito a 9.5 and i'll give the pork in green sauce  a solid 9.  Its worth mentioning  that the Horchata rocked my world and salsa bar was indeed an asset. We finished up with the flan which also received a solid 9 from both of us.   

Customer service was excellent.  We totally screwed up the order/pay/sit protocol.  Without missing a beat, the young man working the cash register, graciously became a waiter, just for us (we had explained this was our first time).  As a parting gesture, he was nice enough to pay for our drinks. 

I think we just found our new \"Mexican place\"."}
{"text":"Our evening was quite pleasant until the waiter decided to drop the check while we were still eating. No offer of dessert, coffee, or after dinner drinks. I interpreted that as meaning you people need to go now. I don't understand why he did that. So just beware people, if you want to enjoy dinner and be left alone, this is not the place to be. And the food gets about a six out of 10."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food at a great price. A classic hole in the wall place."}
{"text":"This is great little hidden gem 3 doors down from harbor freight! The food is wonderful and very reasonably priced. We liked the shredded beef enchiladas and the shrimp tacos! The staff are super friendly and hospitable. It gives you the feeling of a family owned restaurant. My husband and I have been twice in a week. The ladies bathroom was exceptionally clean, probably the cleanest I've ever seen in Vegas! Lol!! So you know their kitchen is clean. :) give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So we ordered Flan, Chicken Enchilada and Cheese Enchalida. The flan is a bit soft and hard to pick up on my fork. The Chicken Enchalida was the best. Spicy, but 10/10 reccomend. The Cheese Enchilada was a little like baby food and not so spicy. The overall experience was amazing. The structure of the place was a little old, but nothing was dirty. The kitchen was crowded buts that not really my problem. Reccoment going here."}
{"text":"The food quality and service were remarkable, but the decor could use some updating. I love that they gave us to-go containers for our food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Well the chips and salsa and bean dip were great. Chips were thin with perfect amount of salt and we're hot and fresh. Salsa was weak on the heat scale but had a good flavor. Bean dip was great. Beer was cold and frosty. 

Then things went south. 

Only reason we came in was we were craving chimichangs. I ordered the red chili. What I received looked like a burrito with a slight tan. It was not flaky or crunchy at all. We had sat in the bar area so I pointed out my disappointment to the bar tender. He proceeded to tell me it was because I ordered the red chili and it makes them soggy. WRONG ANSWER!! I make chimichangs at home and they have never been soggy. I've ordered the same thing elsewhere and never had a soggy chimi. It was flat out under cooked. Then there was the awkward conversation about what I'd like to do. NO! Don't ask if I want it remade just remake it. Then grab the manager and let them know. Welp none of that happened. So I ate my beans and rice which were fine. In the end I paid $20 for beer, chips and salsa, and beans and rice. I was looking forward to posting a 5 star review.... NOT TODAY!"}
{"text":"We been wanting to try Serrano's for a while, The service was good,coffee was great the food was just OK!"}
{"text":"This place a must go to. It's a small, fast food type establishment with the best tamale's and chile relleno's I have ever had. I am VERY picky with Mexican food and this place delivered. The salsa was amazing, loved the choices of salsa. The beans were also great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We have many options for Mexican food in the area and we always decide on Serrano's!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The restaurant looks super clean, the decoration is lovely, the people is super friendly, the chips, salsa & beans are great, and the quality of their food is so good! Can wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I keep craving their food since my first experience here a couple of weeks ago.

Our waitress couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. She brought us chips and we helped ourselves to the salsa bar, which is pretty cool. They serve authentic, delicious Mexican food. I had carne assada with rice and beans, and my husband had enchilada. Everything was very well prepared and tasted great."}
{"text":"Thumbs up! Great little mom and pop shop Mexican food place. The prices are fantastic and reasonable, but seriously the flavors here are absolutely clean, fresh, and delicious. We had the fish, shrimp taco, seafood ceviche, and menudo. Man all man was the flour tortillas to die for! Also the salsa bar and chips are delicious. Like I said clean, tasty flavors. I did not feel full in any bad way after stuffing my face and belly full, well because if Mexican food is not done proper you'll usually want to take a nap and feel like crap after or even take one. This Mexican food was light and refreshing seriously the menudo broth was magical. I will be back to go through the rest of the menu. I highly recommend it and also you'll support a small family owned business which is ten times better than lining the pockets of a Chipotle or Rubios crap."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this place because I drive by it everyday on my way to pick up my husband from work and we were curious about it. We walk in and were greeted by a hostess who asked us if we wanted a table or booth. We opted for booth and she said it would be just a short five minute wait. Five minutes into our wait another couple walks in with a second hostess now beside ours who informed them there was immediate seating for a table and a 5-10 minute wait for the booth. First impressions are everything and it was rather irritating to hear these options when we were not made aware of them. Another five minutes later and we were finally seated. It was a long five minute wait I guess. We seriously walked by 8 booths that were empty but not bussed (remember, first impressions are everything!). Gross. We sat down and my husbands glass had lipstick rings on it. Ewww. A non-server (busser??) came and set chips and pico looking salsa and bean dip on our table without a word and left. Neither were really anything to write home about. About 5 minutes of wondering if we had a server, she arrived and got our drinks. Those came right away, but then she said she would be\"right back\" to take our orders. TEN minutes later....she shows up. The place was NOT busy as we were one of the 10 tables occupied out of about 35 or more (guessing), but they clearly seemed to be understaffed. It took over twenty minutes for our food to arrive. Honestly, the food trumped the slow, unstable service from start to finish. The food was amazing! I got their monthly special, something like a chimi fried with creamy sauce and ranchero sauce both on inside and out! Would we go back? Sure, but after we call ahead and get our order to go! We arrived about 630 and left around 815....
Seriously cannot stress the first impressions thing enough with this place."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for the first time today. It's family owned. Very respectful and great customer service. Priced affordable and food taste delicious. 

I was a bit worried based on the location but that goes to show you that you never judge s book by its cover. 

I def. recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant. The family that owns the restaurant are so nice. I always get a great meal and leave full."}
{"text":"Authentic family style food made fresh daily by the husband and wife owners. Everything on the menu is fantastic and the tamales are super! Menudo is served daily and the enchiladas are to die for!"}
{"text":"Excellent service for a small family restaurant. Many choices of salsa with a very spicy green salsa. Rice and beans were as well as main entree was very tasteful. Will eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Great food great service don't miss this place if your in the mood for some good Mexican food"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try out Serrano's. And after today, \"I will NOT go anywhere else\" for mexican food ever AGAIN!! First, l would like to begin with the \"lovely\" young lady that took my to go order. Very patient  as she took my order. Offered a bag for my condiments.  And a plastic bag for limes, if I wanted them. She presented my to go order by opening each box and explaining the food. I have been in customer service realm for over 30 plus years, and all I can say \"She\" is phenomenal!! And finally, the food. Serrano's make their food with \"LOVE\"  Seriously!!! The food.. \"AMAZING!!!\""}
{"text":"My kids wanted to go back tonight and I was pleasantly surprised at the amazing service we received after having been sorely disappointed with the service during our previous visits in recent times. We were seated with Kyle and he was very friendly and attentive. My kids even loved him. Kyle even helped accommodate my son's special requests. Being exhausted, I was especially appreciative of his willingness to make sure everyone was happy. I called the manager afterwards to compliment Kyle because he certainly deserved the recognition."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. They over deliver on the portions, honestly I'm a big guy and I can barely finish the El Super Burrito. My favorite on the menu. 5 stars"}
{"text":"I have been going to serrano's now since 94.  How can you not love their chips, salsa and bean dip!  It's always fresh and delicious!  

Make sure to order a hard shell taco with beef with your meal, you won't be disappointed.  Their cheese enchiladas, tamales and chimichangas are all great choices.

They have daily specials and they get you in and out the door quickly.

BONUS: They sell fresh homemade tortillas there.  You can stop and pick some up to go and they are absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"We were meeting some friends for dinner and I had chosen a different place, but when they arrived one of them saw Serrano's across the parking lot and exclaimed how much he loved the place, so we went there instead. 

The service was good. We were there to visit and stayed nearly 2 1/2 hours and were never rushed at all. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating.

The food was good, but it was \"franchise Mexican\", not authentic. I expected that since that is what the place is. Portions were quite large and tasty. I had the steak fajitas that came with a side plate of guacamole, rice and beans, refried beans and pico. It was more than I could eat and basically had a second meal to bring home.

Prices are reasonable. I would recommend the place, but be cautioned, it is a family restaurant and most likely there will be noisy kids."}
{"text":"This was a nice friendly establishment. Great customer service. The food wasn't bad reasonable price. I also liked that they had free refills on the aguas unlike other places."}
{"text":"We've been eating in-restaurant and takeout from Serrano's since their family replaced the previous family there. Their food is fantastic, they've cooked off-menu items for us, and their family makes us feel as welcome as the great family before."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food!  Inexpensive and very friendly and attentive servers."}
{"text":"Soooo good! My husband and I love it here. Authentic food, great family owned restaurant, and fast service. The New York steak and cheese enchilada is our go to. The rice and beans that come with your meal are super tasty too. Their salsa bar is simple but packed with flavor. We kill their Salsa verde and garbanzo beans with their warm chips! This place is a hidden gem with super reasonable prices! Wish there was a location in Henderson"}
{"text":"Amazing service! And the food is bomb!!! Love it! The fried ice cream is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Very delicious the prices are a little high but the food is very good. The people there are very nice and friendly and will make it the way you like it even if they don't make it that way! Thank you for delicious food and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic Mexican food! Your food is made to order, so it may take a little longer to get your meal, but there's an awesome salsa bar and and freshly made tortilla chips to munch on. Though it may be way off the Vegas strip, it's definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great service, good food and felt great after! I really enjoyed my dinner her. The food wasn't too spicy and the margarita was really good! We even had the man with the guitar sing to us and he was awesome! I will definitely go back! Best part of our meal was that I felt great after. The last time I had Mexican food that I didn't make I felt horrible the entire night. The quality of the kitchen and the ingredients must have been very high!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant.  If you are ready for authentic Mexican cuisine, great service; a great atmospere - you will love this place too.  The prices are very reasonable.  Prepare for your taste buds to be tickled.   We are impressed that the second generation of Serrano's are running this family business with excellence and with great dignity and respect.  Please keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Continues to be one of my favorite places. Somehow manages restaurant quality with a home cooked feeling. Maybe because it's family owned and opperated. I am crazy about their breakfast burrito. Salsa bar for fresh chips is amazing. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Took the kids to dinner and figured we would check this place out. Overall it was a decent experience. I would probably choose Garcia next time because it's just a little better in my mind. After all if you want great Mexican food you should probably stick to the mom and pop shops they are usually hard to beat."}
{"text":"Food is really good (carne Asada tacos), and they give you chips with bean dip to snack on before your meal.

I've been there twice (both weeknights) and the service has never been very fast. This hasn't been a big deal to me, but just don't expect to get in and out too quick."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food in town. It looks like a hole in the wall from the outside in a sketchy part of town, but inside you are greeted by a courteous and friendly staff. Everything we have tried have been packed with flavor and was very reasonably priced. 

I have tried their al pastor burrito enchilada style, fresh chips and guacamole, and camarones ala diabla.I cannot decide which I liked best...oh yeah, I can... their FRIED ICE CREAM! It was perfect. On our most recent visit we sampled their flan which was also great. On our first visit we overheard a table near us raving about the food, and the woman who brought out the food simply said \"We make it the way we would at home\". I think that pretty much sums up the food.

This is our go to place for Mexican food, and whoever it was that compared this to Roberto's ought to have their head checked. I mean, I guess you can't beat the complementary side of e-coli at Roberto's."}
{"text":"This location was my first foray into sit down mexican food 8 years ago, and I still have warm fuzzies when the possibility to eat here arises.  The bean dip is always warm and tasty, and a little different every time with varying levels of spiciness.  Chips almost always hot and salted reasonably.  Yesterday I had tthe spinach enchiladas dish, I'm very keen on here, with a nice cream-based sauce on top smothered in cheese.  The vegetables side is great and think everyone should get it when they come here.   In terms of food, service, ambience this is really 3 stars, but for being so damn consistent over the last 8 years gotta give this one a 4 just like my closer location."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quickly turning me into a regular. The food is always great, and the service never fails to match. I've ordered here quite a few times now, and the service and food is always better than the last.
I don't think in any of the half-dozen times eating here that there is anything bad that I could say about the service or the food."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow,but good. Chips and hot sauce is always awesome, I could just eat them! I got the Asada Steak Chimichanga, a little to much onion and tomatoes for my taste. Would get it again the meat was yummy and beans and rice are always good."}
{"text":"Very solid Mexican food, almost Tex-Mex style. Heads up, the \"fast food\" part of the restaurant name is a bit of a misnomer. They can do a takeout order in about 10 minutes, but it's basically a walk-up and dine-in establishment.

Enjoyed their California steak burrito- special item, not on the regular menu. Order any of their burritos wet with enchilada sauce, it's mild but flavorful. Trying the enchiladas on my next visit. Breakfast burritos are large with choice of meat, shrimp and fish tacos are listed a la carte instead of as plates.

Service was friendly (and fluent), salsa bar is quite nice (the roasted salsa in particular rocks), and they offer tamales by pre-order: 2 days advance notice, 2 dozen for ~$15?"}
{"text":"I've always seen this place but never tried it. Yesterday we were raving Mexican and we were right by it being at harbor freight. We both got carne asada tacos and they were delicious. Probably the best I've had in awhile!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Ate here once and loved it and kept thinking about it the rest of the week.  Loved it just as much as the 2nd time!  Steak/carne as ada is ridiculously flavorful.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"not impressed. 
food was lacking (cheese enchilada tasted like rubber and beans were over cooked) and service was mildly attentive. with so many great mexican food places here in arizona, i am glad that i dont have to be stuck with Serrano's."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated business with excellent food and customer service. They have a variety of salsa to accompany with chips while your food is made.The food is authentic, made to order, good size portions, and delicious! The customer service is outstanding. I definitely recommend coming here and enjoying a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Come here often.  Love the food and the service.  Owned by a nice family that works there.  One of the few Mexican Restaurants in Vegas that has ground beef as opposed to shredded bef.  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and loved it enough to eat here twice in one day- lunch and dinner. Place is a mom and pop whole in the wall, but very clean. Staff is very friendly and the service is amazing. Food is delicious as well. Being a Russian, I can't confirm authenticity, but can certainly say that it is awesome. Tried shrimp scampi, shrimp ceviche, taco salad and fish tacos so far. Each dish was delicious! About to try steak rancheros. 
They do make everything to order and from scratch, so may take a little bit of time to make- be prepared. But totally worth it. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place was really good! The restaurant is a cozy mom and pop place.. and I was pleasantly surprised! I loved the chips and the salsa bar. I especially loved the pickled cabbage and the carrots I tried the green shrimp enchiladas! I needed extra sour cream.. a bit spicy for me! But it was very tasty!! Thank you yelpers for the awesome reviews . Go check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Got El Super Burrito carne asada wet style and it was excellent! The salsas are wonderful and the atmosphere here is positively relaxing."}
{"text":"Food is always awesome, hot and quick!!  Unfortunately service at this location is pretty pathetic.  But Serrano's is always a family classic for us so we will return, although it would be nice if the waiter even cared we were there."}
{"text":"If I were rating the bean dip they'd get 4 stars! It's delicious with the chips they give you. Bean dip and salsa are complimentary. 

We got the fajitas and they were your basic fajitas. Kids love the bean dip too; and ate and enjoyed their chicken tenders. Other family members get the machaca plate or machaca tacos (I think I enjoyed that more). This place is worth going back to! Bean dip!!!!!"}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos were tough and dry. The staff was very friendly but the prices and the food were not that good. I don't think I will be  returning."}
{"text":"Authentic home made food. Great selection of salsas everything is so tasty I recommend you the flan and any plate you'll try is fresh and good. I was surprised that everything ok the menu was available. Very clean venue."}
{"text":"Went during lunch time and serve was extremely slow."}
{"text":"What a great find. We had been up on Mt Charleston in the morning and looking for somewhere to get breakfast em before hitting red rock canyon. This place was perfect. A nicely prepared burrito with fresh tortilla and freshly made chips with salsa. Not your at a dads breakfast but hey, we were on East Coast time so more like lunch for us. A very tasty and filling breakfast!"}
{"text":"Family owned Mexican food stop, fresh salsa bar with a good variety, beats the heck out of the other chain just down the street. Clean interior that is well lit and cooled with ceiling fans during the hot summer months, nice subtle decor, comfy booths. I've eaten here there or four times, and never been disappointed, always leaving fat n happy! Just had a breakfast burrito with chorizo, enchilada style, and yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The decor isn't the greatest but the food and service makes up for that!! Never have had a bad experience with anything we have tried."}
{"text":"I like the way they cook the food fresh. Some restaurants they just heat the food, but this restaurant you know that they're cooking it so there's a wait. I always order the beef milanesa. It's so delicious and the flan is so good as well. We've been coming to this restaurant for years."}
{"text":"Very nice staff. Had to request warm chips each time they were replenished. Regular salsa was ok, spicy one was excellent. Bean burrito enchilada style was good but came lukewarm. Bean dip is below average. Sarah is the best server there by far."}
{"text":"Food and service is great. It's a smaller, family-run, authentic Mexican restaurant located in a not so nice compound. Took a while to find this at night since its in a run down area, but other than the location, this place is a gem."}
{"text":"I grew up going to Serranos and after 30 years their Chips & Salsa/Bean Dip remains the best I've ever had! It really is the standard that I just all salsas against. Their shredded beef Chimichangas are excellent as well. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Well I went back and it was a little better now that they have gone back to the traditional menu.  My biggest issue today is it sort of fell off my radar when they made the changes and I don't have anyone in the family begging to go there anymore.  Prior to the changes I would say we would go 2-6 times a month.  Now I would say maybe once every 2 months.  Serrano's has become one of those places where we go if I don't feel like cooking and I don't get much push back from the family on going there. Certainly not a place everyone is begging me to go... It's more like the family will put up with it.  Would I recommend it... not my first or second choice in the area, but it is close and for that if I don't get much push back it'll serve the purpose.  Certainly not a glowing review."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a year. Food is consistent, and I really like the salsa bar cabbage pickle. My last visit here, which is my last, was marred by the daughter of the owners. I placed my order at the counter, we agreed where I would sit(it was busy, one table remained at the entrance) I said that table would be fine. After I ordered, went to sit down, a newspaper was on the table. She came to give me the chips & said that must be his paper( referring to the man who came in after me, ordered after me) She then asked if I would share the table with him. Then she said \" I don't want Him to leave....\" bad bad energies given off now from her( but you'd rather I leave?)So, I got up, left the chips, waited by the register counter for another table. Long story short, I will not ever eat here again.  Your parents were nice to me and my daughter, but then again, where did you get your ways from? All of us carry the same fiat."}
{"text":"So glad I stopped in. The hospitality alone is what makes this place so great. There is a very comfortable \"home\" feeling there. The woman who greeted me and helped me at the register was wonderful. She was very very kind. Food was great! I will definitely stop in again!"}
{"text":"I had an early lunch here today and I have to say, service was prompt, pleasant, and the food was very good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is first time I am writing review.
Serrano is the worst Mexican food I ever encountered : the worst casadilla, the worst Cana assada, the worst guacamole. 
It Is shame that had such a  good Rating. I would give a half Star."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I think it's pretty good.  I like the bean dip that they bring with the salsa but I wish the salsa was spicy!  I like to go for lunch since they have a $6.95 lunch special and there's alot of choices on the lunch special.  Would I say it's my favorite place?  No....but it's decent and the service is always good."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Little hole in the whole but has some really good food. Torres and carne asada fries are super good! The carne asada fries have enchilada sauce all over them which makes them super tasty! Great customer service and good prices as well! Def recommend"}
{"text":"I'm from Los  Angeles and very picky about my Mexican food but this place tastes like home :)"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best Mexican food in town! My husband and I were visiting and decided to try based upon their awesome yelp reviews! The customer service is out of this world, attentive to detail, and the flavor in the food really speaks for itself! Also the price and quality of this place is unbelievable! It is a family owned business full of passion, love and wonderful food!! 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"Good food. They did a good job remodeling this place. The new menu is horrible and does not work. Please change back to the triditional menu. The new menu is confusing and the selection is too small."}
{"text":"Very good. Fast service and cheap prices. Bean dip is the best thing here!!! Great bar selection and the staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! 
Best, cheerful, friendly service. 
The food is amazing. 

Best Mexican food at great prices. 
You won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"We ordered take out and our food was cold. The only good thing was the guacamole. Spent $50 on food we didn't even eat."}
{"text":"I just found this place not too long ago and it's delicious! Will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"One of favorite Mexican Restaurants in the Phoenix area. Taco, enchilada and tostada combo tonight. Good service, good prices, fast service (by Matt)."}
{"text":"If you are used to Tex Mex do not go here!!!!! The beef is like pot roast. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the chips and salsa were great!"}
{"text":"I order the cheese enchiladas everytime, so good. I often order a large container of the beans to go. Their home-made tortillas are great too. They have friendly staff and fast service whenever I call up an order for pick-up."}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant continues to amaze us. Every dish and soup we have ordered are just so good. The owners treat you like family. Must try their soups! The fish tacos are amazing. Help keep this family run restaurant going. JUST AMAZING FOOD AND SERVICE."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito that really hit the spot. Love the selection of salsas and pickled vegetables. Very friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"My husband and I just finished eating here. Everything you read about homemade food, FRESH food in a very friendly atmosphere. Management is warm and inviting. The tortillas for our dishes were made on the spot. You can have lunch food at 930 am, if you want. Get the shrimp enchiladas. 

Oh, and whoever said this was a sketchy area is being stupid. This area is fine - eat here and do it often!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my mom. The service was outstanding and the lunch was great. The phrase of the day is a nice bit of fun as well. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to order some food on Sunday. So i called in and ordered 2 pork tacos with rice and beans with a side of chips and salsa. The person at Serrano's told me the price was 18.00! I could not believe it....what a rip off. Had to call back and cancel that non-sense."}
{"text":"Food is excellent it's good and price wise it's very reasonable highly recommend to anyone who want good food nice service at a fair cost"}
{"text":"Had an amazingly delicious chimi plate and excellent service but, I won't be going back until they take down their 'no guns' sign. Took 3 stars off for that."}
{"text":"Serranos still good after all these years. Glad to see there still open. Food is great and portions are huge for the price you pay. And the service is always excellent. Bonus when you dine in they give you an order of chips and have a good selection of salsa to choose from at their salsa bar."}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST salsa! I love their burritos, and oh my gosh the tortillas! I stock up and freeze them when I visit. Can not get enough, I'm a bit of a tortilla enthusiast. The place is run really well, clean, and everyone is super polite. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Chips, bean dip, and salsa was ok. Green burrito, rice and beans were below average. There was no green chili flavor at all - basically it was a brownish, dull flavor. The meat chunks were tough and not fit to eat. The rice and beans tasted a few days old. Margarita was ok, not much alcohol though. I usually go to Rositas which is right across the street - their green burrito (try it smothered in green sauce and cheese) is 100 x's better than Serranos - in fact every thing is better at Rositas. I will head over to the chandler Serranos and try that next time - hopefully they don't bring their food in from the same place as this one.  Honestly I can't believe this place is still in business. Try Rositas instead for some excellent mexican food."}
{"text":"Beyond the excellent food, the thing that sets this little, off the beaten path, gem apart is the service. You'll need to ordered at the back counter but then you'll be seated and served a la full service restaurant. You don't even have to pay until you're done. (Just in case you want a desert) The homemade salsa bar is incredible. The carnitas burritos, chili relleno, shrimp enchiladas, and chimichanga were all great. In the neighborhood or driving through? You really should try this place. The only one small negative, no cerveza !"}
{"text":"Great customer service and I love that it seems small and family owned. Also inexpensive. Unfortunately the food was pretty good, but not really great in any way. I did like how they have a salsa bar."}
{"text":"Great find, thanks yelpers. We had the beef soup, machaca and kids chicken fingers. Good size portions, made to order, fresh ingredients and reasonably priced. Very friendly staff, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Man I am so unhappy about this Serrano's 
I had a bad experience with this place about a year ago. So I was hungry and decided to give them another chance. The hostess sat me in a booth and I just sat there. I think the waitress that was supposed to help me was just overwhelmed with all the tables she has at one point she told someone she was doing 5 tables at the same time. So I have no complaints about her. What I couldn't believe is the lack of service the hostess could have provided like bring a glass of water or chips.. or have a busperson do it. Instead she just stood behind the hostess cash register and did absolutely nothing to help the waitress. After 10 minutes I got up and left. Telling her what a let down and major disappointment I had in what use yo be one of my favorites.  Hopefully this Serrano' s is the only one with bad service.  ."}
{"text":"Legit hole in the wall family run Mexican restaurant. The food was delicious. We hit it during a rush so there was a long wait for our food. But it was worth the wait and they brought is complimentary chips and salsa and apologized several times for the wait.  We ordered chili verde with rice and beans, a taco plate of one each chicken and goat tacos with rice and beans and a shrimp taco ala carte. The salsa bar had many delicious offerings including chick peas - first time ever seeing that on a salsa bar and they were yummy. With a large coke the entire meal was only $22.50. You order at the register and they bring the food on real plates with silverware. Nice place. Terrific food! You will love it, I bet."}
{"text":"5 stars if you like small hole in the wall spots with awesome food and cheap prices. I love this spot."}
{"text":"Almost missed out on a Mexican treasure.   

It's small and hard to see from the street. Mexican food was calling my name tonight. I'm so glad it caught my eye.... yum. 

Home made enchilada sauce that is delightful on everything we ordered. You can tell the chile's were slowly cooked down with the perfect amount of salt. 

All of their salsas (5) were delicious. 

The Carne asada was smokey and flame kissed. It melted in my mouth. 

The masa harina uses for the tamales was perfect! 

I honestly couldn't find anything that didn't taste awesome and wasn't cooked from scratch!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  Such a fantastic experience at this location.  I am a fan of Serrano's food, and tried this location as it is close to work.  I was a bit concerned trying to go during my lunch hour, but the staff was extremely attentive.  I was in and out in about 30 minutes. I will definitely be going back for more lunches in the furture."}
{"text":"I came down to Vegas for the day. Was looking for a bite to eat and decided to try this place out. The asada mexican pizza was delicious and first time ever trying one other then taco bell and I live in Los Angeles. If the locals don't know about this place they should give it a try. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"You need to get fried ice cream from this place !! Or any kind of food is authentic , total mom & pops restaurant. do yourself a favor, eat here & don't skip dessert !"}
{"text":"Serrano's is one of those Mexican chains that just does it right. While it is slightly dirty and the staff can sometimes be lacking, their food more than makes up for it. It tends to be slightly on the spicy side so make sure you are prepared for that before ordering. I personally like this location over some of the others in the area too because they are more consistent with their food. 

I sincerely miss being in AZ because of Serrano's!"}
{"text":"I'm willing to bet that this place was a shining gem in its heyday.  Several days have passed since that day...leaving the same gem, minus a lot of the luster.

The restaurant itself is quite spacious. It has a full bar to the left, a large recessed dining area in the middle (geared more towards groups), and a more secluded are to the right for smaller groups and/or couples. All three sections are quite spacious. 

We happened to sit off to the right. We had a party of four and half (one three-year-old). The tables in this section were for a maximum of four people, and our daughter is FAR to tall for a high chair. Thankfully for us, where there are some bay windows facing out of the restaurant, there is a nice little padded booth created there, which turned out to be the PERFECT place for our daughter!

The menu for Serrano's is typical, but it's pretty limited. They offer the usual Mexican fare, usually in both chicken and beef (and ONE that offered shrimp). Both the quality and quantity of each dish we ordered was substantial. Suffice it to say that each member of our party left the restaurant with a take-home box.

Our server was stellar. The restaurant wasn't very crowded, so if he HAD been lacking, it would have made things very awkward. But, as it happened, Christian was phenomenal! He was patient with us while we waited for the final member of our party to arrive. He was very diligent with keeping our drinks full and our table cleared.

But, the coolest thing Christian did for us was regarding dessert. You see, it was my wife's birthday, and her parents wanted to go to this restaurant for a celebratory dinner. My wife was deathly afraid that the restaurant employees were going to make her wear a sombrero and sing a song to her...and Christian almost made that happen. However, when he could see the sheer terror behind my wife's eyes at the prospect of public humiliation, he took the clue, and offered to comp her dessert. 

This shopping center that houses this restaurant is practically empty. There are \"For Lease\" signs in several of the windows. I can see why this place has stood the test of time...though, I feel that their menu could use a little updating, which is the only reason I opted for four stars instead of five for this cozy little relic."}
{"text":"Omg this place is so bomb!!! And excellent customer service. I definitely will recommend this place to everyone. This is one mom and pop family owned business that I will continue to support."}
{"text":"Lets start at the beginning of the awful service.  After waiting for the spill to be cleaned up from the server dropping soda on the floor, I was able to join my table.  We were a party of 13, which I thought might have something to do with having to wait 15 minutes to get a basic margarita.  I asked the waitress what the wait was for the 3rd time and she explained the bartender was really busy.  Then I got ants in my pants waiting and I went to the bar.  Guess what?  No bartender.  After 4 minutes he showed up to tell me that he could not serve me at the bar AND at the table.  Regardless of whether it was a separate ticket.  That way in case I got cut off at the table I couldn't go to the bar.  Since, I had yet to have anything but water, I was obviously irritated and called the manager over to give the okay.
Now, back to the table I go, the margarita is finally there.  I order my food, the kids food, then the rest of the table orders theirs.
It comes out, tastes good, but not all of it arrives.  So, we go back and forth until it finally does all get there and everyone is starting to eat, time lapse 30 minutes of joviality ensue.  Well, knowing the speed of their service I and the poor quality of their margarita, I order a vodka soda double tall with a slice of orange.  My companions order their drinks and we wait.  Apparently, in vein, as when the libations return with the manager, she passes out only the drinks to my companions and none to me.  The manager stated she couldn't serve me because the table had already ordered a lot of alcohol.  She didn't ask me how much I had ordered, or any specific individual, but brandished a receipt with the orders upon it.  She didn't ask who was driving, we had two cars and neither driver was drinking.  She didn't ask for anyone's ID's prior to serving us, but expressly conveyed her knowledge of alcohol service that she learned in class last week.  
Welp, I was having none of it.  I asked for my check and told her we were done with the non-sense.  The server then had to go back through each item to figure out how to split a check.  My friend actually had to work the POS system to help the manager correctly divide the checks and 20 minutes later we finally hit the door for the last time.  
Moral of the story is: if you want to have good food, drinks, and service, then head to Serrano's and invite the staff to join you somewhere else to experience the pleasure."}
{"text":"UPDATED  The next evening we received a call from Rick Serrano.  This alone raised my original rating from 1 star to 3.  We spoke of our visit and supplied a few more details.  Rick was very pleasant and apologetic for our experience and was genuinely concerned.  We didn't ask for any compensation as we don't believe that should be a factor when it comes to reviews.  However, Serrano's being a family run business, this is the kind of response that speaks volumes and keeps the customers coming, new and old alike.  Try them out for yourself.  I'll update again after our next visit."}
{"text":"The family owned and operated business has amazing people that cook and serve your awesome dishes. I flew in from Dallas Texas Just so I can taste their meal!"}
{"text":"The whole experience was mediocre compared to a Robertos, Betos, or a Rancherito. Fairly simple restaurant that is clean. The employees were very nice. Wait time for the food took a while. I ordered the Carne Asada super burrito which tasted like any other burrito that you would order at Robertos didnt really stick out, plus it lacked flavor. Next I ordered a shrimp taco which was super simple, the shrimp seemed like it came from a prefrozen bag from Costco or something. The only that the restaurant has going for then is their horchata which is amazing and their fried ice cream. The fried ice cream was good but small in quantity. Amazing presentation though. The price for all of it was a bitt over priced for what I got."}
{"text":"High quality Mexican food. Reasonable prices. Family run business. This is my go to. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed eating here. They were so accommodating because I am vegan and the beans don't contain lard. I was told that the rice didn't contain chicken broth either. We will definitely be back and we noticed that the other patrons were repeat customers.  This fact definitely speaks volumes."}

{"text":"My husband & I found Serrano's on Yelp & we just had to come check it out! First of all I wanna start off by saying there costumer service is truly one of a kind! I mean the girl up in front taking our order is absolutely amazing! Professional courteous sweet & knowledgebase. We told her it was our first time & she even offered to go over the menu with us. 
I also have this place 5 stars because it's so nice & clean.
The salsa bar was kept stocked & full, there chips & salsa is very very fresh.
Another reason why I gave this place 5 stars is because they have refills on Horchata & Pina come on how many places do you know that has refills on Horchata & Pina??
We ordered the chili cheese fries & we didn't get that much carne asada on them that was the only disappointment but other than that 5 stars we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. The service is always friendly. The food is delicious.. Best Tamale! 

Casual atmosphere. Very clean."}
{"text":"This place is so consistent. The food is always SO good, and the girl that takes the orders is super nice and friendly. The prices are really reasonable too. The food is authentic and flavorful. Super good all around.. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Lovely little spot with fresh, homemade Mexican food. Hubby and I came here for breakfast. Ordered the Huevos Rancheros. It hit the spot! Everything tasted fresh! Service was great and friendly. Will definitely be back to try other items!"}
{"text":"Welp,  we came here because our local friends said it was the best. And we were highly disappointed! Chips and salsa are good.  Stop right there!!!!!  We ordered the chicken tortilla soup and it taste like Campbell's soup with chunks of chicken, we ordered the shrimp fajitas and the shrimp tasted super rubbery, fresh out of a frozen shrimp bag smothered with pepper.  The kids had chelicera  strips and they didn't even look like chicken.  They looked like  imitation chicken. Spare yourselves!!"}
{"text":"Honestly great little Mexican food joint. The girl that works there in the evening gives great customer service and his very polite and informative. Love the huge cups you can get there for just $2.75 that you can fill up endlessly if you wanted. The tacos and burritos are great and even their chips have a nice flavor! Really love going to this place each time."}
{"text":"We got the Mexican pizza, chile relleno, and chile verde. Everything was great. Try the fried ice cream!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is cute and relaxing. The tables seating six people and more are nice because the middle of the table has a bar where servers put the chips and dip making them easily accessible for everyone. If you have a larger party they will give you more than one serving of chips and they will refill them as well. This is the only good part of my review. 

Starting with the bathrooms: they were not cleanly in the slightest. Most stalls were out of toilet paper and when my son flushed the toilet, the toilet handle came completely out of the toilet tank. When my husband went to the bathroom, the toilets were clogged with feces. His bathroom trip was thirty minutes after mine, and he reported that they were just as dirty. This tells me that none of the hostesses had checked or bothered to clean the bathrooms in the last thirty minutes. I've spent several years in food service and everywhere I've worked, policy was to check bathrooms every fifteen minutes during dinner rush. 

The service was subpar as well. We ordered our food in a timely manner, just a few minutes after our drinks were brought to our table. At the time, we were surrounded by several empty tables. By the time we finally received our food, all the tables around us had been seated, served and were eating their food. In that time, we received a quiet and almost non apologetic excuse that something had happened in the kitchen with our food. From the time we had ordered our food, we had waited over an hour for it. 

My husband's order of shrimp fajitas was smaller than a normal portion (half of what you'd get at chilis) and cost almost 16$. My two a la cart flautas came with a garnish of lettuce, Guac and sour cream which had hair in it. My sisters beans and rice were completely cold. And while I realize this is a Mexican restaurant, my two year olds chicken and fries were terrible. If you have a picky toddler, just don't bother ordering the chicken tenders. Again, this was a little more reasonable considering it was chicken ordered at a Mexican restaurant off a children's menu. 

I would have been a little more forgiving of such a busy Saturday night except that we had no manager come to explain what had happen or even apologize. We were there before the rush had even happened. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious! My favorite Mexican restaurant. Great service. No styrofoam dining. Dishes are nice. All the food is great. I come about once a week and try something different. I like the shrimp and there salsa is off the hook."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. The basket of warm tortilla chips with salsa and bean dip was nice.  Food was just okay. I had a chicken chimichanga that was supposed to be deep-fried but seemed kind of \"under-done\" Had one thin outer layer that was slightly crispy, then the inner layers were soft. Seemed rather over-priced. We got iced tea and it was $4.50....! My husband had the chicken enchilada suiza. The spicing was very uneven on that. One bite would be medium, the next would be Very spicy. Not someplace we would visit again"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken enchilada meal and it was so delicious starting with the Sauce to the meat to the tortilla it was very satisfying even the rice on the side was superb. The store  was very cute and really clean ! And the lady up front was really sweet and welcoming people should really come visit this spot"}
{"text":"Very good Authentic food! Clean! And Great customer service! Strongly recommend. Coming from Los Angeles it's been so hard to find good Mexican food, but this place IS IT!"}
{"text":"Our favorite in Las Vegas for their burritos.  Their chilaquiles and carnitas are excellent. Service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"We come here every single time we come to Las Vegas! Sometimes more than once a day! You won't find delicious Mexican food like this anywhere else in Vegas! I highly recommend coming for breakfast for their Chilaquiles!!! AMAZING! And I just about had everything on third lunch/ dinner menu!  Service is amazing and a great family owned restaurant! Try it out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I will not be returning to Serrano's again.  The last time I went, our orders were wrong and my plate of food was cold.  The only positive thing I have to say is that they are conveniently located and their service is prompt."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try a different soup, this time got a bowl of chicken and rice; pik attached.  Was good, definitely gave you the sense it was homemade.  If you feel a cold coming, head this way!"}
{"text":"So after our horrible escapade into the taco shoppe down the road from CSN, the fiancé and I decided that we needed something more refreshing. So we head into Serrano's, which would have been our first choice had they not been closed yesterday (Monday).  

We walk in, find a quaint little dining area made up of brick and culture, and IT'S CLEAN. The decor is everywhere, but it's not in your face, and that's great. The floors are decently clean and the tables are spotless. It's a late dinner at 7:00pm, and they have a steady flow of customers (mostly picking up and taking home). The music is low, but not so much that it's inaudible. I believe you go up and order, then take a seat and wait to be served (otherwise we totally did the whole dining thing wrong, lol). 

Vanessa helped us at the register, and she was wonderful. I mean WONDERFUL. She was patient, considerate, and incredibly professional.

The salsa bar was gorgeous and very decorative. They add a little twist on what you typically see in these styles of restaurant. The jalapeños and carrots were divine. The salsas were each distinct and delicious (the only one we did not try was the green). They bring you the traditional basket of chips, which were tasty and obviously homemade. A great filler while we waited for our food. 

I ordered the Albondigas Soup (I'm a sucker for home-made meatballs). She tells me immediately of the semi-long wait time for my soup. Fifteen minutes, no problem. I appreciate her letting me know. They had it out in less than ten. What a broth. Warm, flavorful, incredibly filling and just...fucking awesome. It's the only way I can describe it. The meatballs were the perfect consistency and size. The pairing with the broth, squash, carrots, onions, and parsley was wonderful. I added some Tapatio (I love everything spicy) and it was by far in my top ten soup list. 

The fiancé ordered a shredded beef chimichanga. The meat was so tender that it could melt in your mouth. The exterior was crispy and warm, and the surrounding beans and rice were, quite possibly, some of the best I've ever had. Sauce on top was flavorful, and the shredded cheese actually tasted fresh. 

Onto the flan. I loved it. Plain and simple. Next time I intend to order it without chocolate sauce, but, nonetheless, very rarely do I find great flan. Presentation was a little out there and excessive, but the taste was all there. 

The horchata was so smooth, milky, and wonderful. I asked Vanessa if it's made in house, and, to my absolute delight, it is. I damn near cried when my cup broke and some spilled out. But Vanessa was awesome, and grabbed me a replacement cup to prevent more waste. A tad bit spilt on my phone, and she asked me if my phone was alright in the process of helping us clean up my mess. I wish we'd had a five or ten on us. Would have given her a larger tip. Next time, I suppose. Because we're definitely returning."}
{"text":"Quick, fresh, DIVINE. Customer service is SPOT ON.  Salsas to die for. Meat is heaven. Our new go to for quick yummy Mexican."}
{"text":"Stopped in to meet my wife for lunch. We were not impressed by the food at all. Service was good. Food was par at best. 
stopping back any time soon will not be on my radar."}
{"text":"I just discovered this little hidden gem about two weeks ago and it was love at first bite. It's hard to find a traditional family  Mexican restaurant but this is it. The carne asada torta is amazing. The salsa bar is the best. The complimentary chips and salsa is a great touch. The service is very nice. Definitely will be one of my frequent spots"}
{"text":"I'm particular with Chile Relleno and this place hits the spot in my heart. Their Flan dessert is to die for! The staff are wonderful! Salsas are delicious. I highly recommend you try this place once. It's addicting!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try on the spur of the moment. Excellent!!!! I'm pretty sure it's been around awhile but was a good find! I had the carne asada burrito. Nice selection of salsa and some other things I hadn't tried before. There was a garbanzo bean thing that was very good and something I would call Mexican Cole slaw. It had carrots, cabbage and artichokes sliced up with a spicy light dressing. Yum!"}
{"text":"Experience was good. Mike was our server. Very generous and prompt. The other servers kept my table of 10 filled with salsa and chips and water. I got the Chile Reno. It was alright, which is why I docked a star. But overall the experience and environment and service was great."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today after reading reviews.  It is a small place in a mostly closed strip mall, but the food is great.  Very nice people running the place.  Will definitely be back again.  Also very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The food has gone downhill recently. It used to be excellent, now it's only so-so. Meanwhile, the prices have gone up. I could understand the price increase, but not when the food quality has gotten worse. Lower quality and higher prices is not a very good combination. I feel like they should go back to the way the menu used to be. Or hire back the old chef. Whatever it takes to get the quality back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. It is a family run little hole in the wall that serves well made food at a fair price. The last time I was there, I got their nachos, and the were piled high with meat, beans, guacamole, and all the other necessary items. Delicious!"}
{"text":"My son in-law told us about Serrano's. We had the barbacoa burrito and the chileaquiles the food was amazing.  The kids chicken strips are really good.  Will to eat her when we return next time."}
{"text":"The service here was excellent. We got in around 6:30 on a Saturday night and waited about 10 minutes for a table, which is to be expected at that time. We were seated and right away one of the managers came over to let us know that our server was a little behind and if he could get us started on drinks. He stopped by again for ordering dinner and periodically throughout the evening, we really appreciated that. 

The only complaint that we had was that all of the food seemed to be very onion-y. The salsa had many huge chunks of white and green onion, the bean dip had plenty of onions, even the machaca and chicken were filled with tons of onions. This may be pleasant to some people, but we are not fans of so much onion."}
{"text":"I thought this was the chain Serrano's, but instead it's a local chain within Arizona (I think). 

We went with a large group of people, so that may taint my experience. The service was slow, and they missed one of our orders completely and ended up delivering it nearly 30 minutes after everyone else had their food. 

We had some margaritas - overly sweet and completely forgettable. 

We got the Del Mar sampler along with the steak fajitas. The fajitas were fine and filling. The Del Mar sampler came out two different ways. One of our companions got this (and it came out a startlingly half hour before mine did - they messed up in the kitchen) and it was blah. The fish was overcooked, and the other flavors blended into a mush. Mine came out later and the fish was done superbly - flaky soft with lots of flavor - and the rest of it was tasty.

I think there are better options within the Phoenix/Mesa area."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Great price great food great service!! Awesome hole in the wall place"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas and was looking for some good Mexican food and followed Yelp to this restaurant, and as others have said the portions are great, food is delicious, and the service is very friendly.

The only thing I will add is that two different gps maps insisted the location was on the east side of the street which had me driving circles in the strip mall then around the block. Turned out the restaurant is on the west side of the street next to Harbor Freight Tools. Also could be I just had direction issues because I'm a tourist!"}
{"text":"I asked if they make torta milanesa. The last said it wasn't on the menu,but that they could make it. It was delicious. The staff was nice. The place was clean. I highly recommend. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Okay I will never go to any other taco shop again.  I feel like I'm at Grandma's house getting the best Mexican meal.  If you are on 95 and Rainbow you must stop!  We had cheese enchiladas, chile relleno, chicken quesadilla, ground beef tacos, and I couldn't decide which was best.  All super delicious!!"}
{"text":"absolutely love this place! Staff is always friendly, the food is amazing! especially their chicken enchiladas and albondigas. Their fried ice cream is some of the best I've ever had too."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good price!!! If you want a great Mexican meal without breaking the bank, this is the place to go:)"}
{"text":"We were very impressed with the food. And the customer service was outstanding. The guy Albert that helped us was awesome. I'm from los Angeles were the best mexican food is and this place rocked it. I would suggest it highly"}
{"text":"This is a really lovely little spot sandwiched between Harbor Freight and Food 4 Less. Don't let the name fool you, this isn't your average grab and go taqueria. Their dine-in meals are served on proper plates, not in styrofoam boxes, and are brought to you at your table. The free refills on the horchata were a welcome surprise. Take that, Roberto's!
Serrano's is a mom and pop establishment in it's 9th year, according to the friendly young man who served us. The place was impeccably clean and looked freshly painted, (including the restroom,) and the decor is fun with lots of personality.  The food isn't gourmet, but it's solid, freshly prepared, and not greasy and heavy like most taco shops. It tastes like a casual, home cooked meal. I had a small steak, a chile relleno, and a cheese enchilada. The chile had a bright fresh flavor, and the enchilada was tasty. The rice and beans weren't as out of this world as some of the reviews say, but definitely above average. They have a very nice salsa bar, but most of them were a bit watery and could have used a little more oomph. The charred red salsa was an exception! Yum!  (I'll be the first to admit that I'm spoiled by my roommate's fantastic Mexican home cooking, and my boyfriend's epic salsa, so the bar is set pretty high in my world. Haha!) We finished off our meal with an exceptionally good fried ice cream on the house. (Thanks, guys!) For food, I'd rate Serrano's at 4 stars. For the excellent service, friendliness, pride, and love these folks clearly put in to their establishment? A solid 5 and then some! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I am going to start with paying tribute to my friend Stefany's review some 3 years ago. This place has \"take out\", and I'm sure the owners appreciate this aspect of the business. However, to truly get your \"money's worth\", you and your friends need to dine in, and enjoy the good food fresh and hot, and experience the charm and ambiance of this establishment. 

This place is very authentic from the \"Mexican small town\" ambiance to the presentation of the food, to the friendly and personal service everyone receives from Jose and Elvia. The fact that employees of local favorite, Don Roberto's Taco Shop, sent me here with their assurance that this place was true, authentic Mexican Style food, was an endorcement of excellance. 

I was not disappointed. My only regret is that I gave them my \"standard test\" of a Tamale (which very few places serve in the Summer) a Chile Relleno, and the best Taco of the House. The food was hot, good, and did not disappoint.  I only wish I had indulged in a true Mexican dish, and not something I could probably find at the establishments that cater to the Millenial Gringo. 

It's not a place to take someone who does not appreciate Mexican Culture, or a person who judges you, by your choice of eateries by finding a trendy crowd. This is for the person that appreciates this food and values authenticity. 

Why didn't I give it a 5 Star Rating? I need to practice what I preach; Sample and evaluate the authentic cuisine you can't order at the Trendy and Stylish Mexican places, and compare it with what I ate with the Locals in Quintana Roo, Mexico. 

I will be back."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm sure we'll be back. The food made me feel like I was eating at someone's grandmother's house. Not like a chain restaurant. 
The staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years now, i guess you can call us regulars, Lol. Nice little hole in the wall family owned Mexican restaurant that is very convenient.  You are always greeted when you walk in and when you leave. With a varity of  Authentic Mexican dishes to choose from, I highly recommend this restaurant when you have the urge for quick and reasonablly priced meals. My all time favorite is their Menudo. Cant go there without getting it!!"}
{"text":"Took the family here.  I liked it.  Food took awhile but it was great.  Very nice people.  Family run.  I will go here again.   Plus, harbor freight is right next door !!
Update - Have been back 3 times.  Every time was good."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now. Our favorite place closed for some unknown reason so we've been searching for a new Mexican restaurant. The service is top notch. Attentive, polite and gracious. The food is quite tasty. Portion size is generous. This is one of those kind of places where you want to keep coming back. I can't wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"I think that Serrano's has a lot of hype because of it's been here so long and time builds memories of good times. I on the other hand have not had that I go places for good food I have not been impressed with any of the meals I have ate at a many Serrano's locations. I would really say greasy slop along with the chandler location served me a Fat Tire draft with a lime wow come on. So I say save your money and look elsewhere."}
{"text":"ordered some tamales and Mr Serrano was cooking tem when I came to pick them up. I was expcting frozen! When they were done he even showed them to me,,,, I almost devoured them right then and there. Needless to say they were amazing!"}
{"text":"Just went today and it has definitely changed. Food is not the same. The menu is small. Ridiculous that I ordered the combo and it does not even include rice and beans. It also tasted bland. I miss the old food, menu and ambiance. The restaurant was pretty empty after 5... that tells you something. Will never return!"}
{"text":"So happy a friend recommended this place! 

I typically so not like the rice and beans from Mexican restaurants because usually bland but boy oh boy...I've never had rice and beans so flavorful! That alone I would come back for. 
We ordered a 'wet' super burrito (carne asada) and a combo plate, chicken enchilada and a crispy carne asada taco. All very delicious! The guy behind the counter was really nice told us about different menu items as recommendations. Their salsa bar had great options to choose from and you get a bowl of chips to enjoy when you dine in."}
{"text":"Everything I try here has always been tasty and filling.

Real modern, spacious, and clean restaurant that never fails to cheer me up with their hospitality. You will always get your moneys worth no matter what meal you choose from. I'm always around during breakfast time but occasionally they have live Mariachi playing during the night if you want to join in on some karaoke.
All food is freshly prepped, coming out steaming hot. The Machaca con Huevo is great if you're into loading up tortillas, but there's some type of seasoning they put in their Breakfast Burrito that makes this simple dish taste so damn good! Desserts are a must if you have the room for it, first timers for Deep Fried Ice Cream are more than welcome... actually I think I'll go get some right after I hit up LVAC this weekend. (Talk about sugar synthesis)

If i had to be picky on what i didn't like, it would be the salsa that is served for their fluffy chips.. to much onions can be pretty overwhelming Lol. Other than that, solid 4.5 stars:)"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing. Came in for our first time and dinner was outstanding. We will definitely be back again as I recommend you give this place a try. 5 stars all around frome quality of food to service."}
{"text":"Great Mex (IMHumble East LA opinion) prepared and crafted with love and passion by the owner and his dear family. Oh that fresh home made salsa bar is very special and well worth the visit that will keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"Very decent Mexican food is served here at a very good price. Plus, food is served quickly and backed by very good service.  And you have many options for salsa. What more can I say?"}
{"text":"Salsa bar is the bomb and food is spot on...got to come and try!!!!!13 years and going strong"}
{"text":"I went in with high hopes...I love authentic mexican food! I saw some good yelp reviews, and live near by.....
Not at all what I was hoping for......
I had the grilled chicken taco salad..... ugh....... quality was just not there! Worst Grilled chicken ever!
My husband had the carne asada burrito.... he thought the same.... ugh.... quality was not there.....
Their chips and salsa was the only reason for the two stars, fresh, tasty, really good.
The rest of the food was not good at all.
Ingredients are not fresh or prepared fresh.
I get that they are family owned and operated...... but this is not quality authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"Great Homemade Mexican food! We went here from the Yelp reviews and this place and the very nice gal who took care of us and the food..."}
{"text":"Not sure why I didn't review this place sooner. I come here all the time for lunch. Everything is made fresh  and it's always good. I usually get the Asada fries or the Serannos burrito... But I've discovered the TORTAS- they are the best!!!!! I recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic food. The customer service is Great too. I'm always offered chips and salsa even when I'm getting food to go lol, and their prices are very decent for such big portions!**** you gotta try the Chillequilles.! They are hands down the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Serrano's. We have been eating there for 20 years. The green chili is my favorite. They have great chips and salsa is good. I have to have the green chili like once a week. Addicting! Great service!"}
{"text":"Finally found a great mexican place out here In the east valley. Had the carne asada chimi enchilada style. The meat has the best flavor ever. Came with a side of beans and rice. They where some of the best I have had in a while. Staff is great and friendly, can't wait to come back and try something else on the menu"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been ordering from this restaurant for years. Very nice family run business. They all take good care of not only their customers but they make sure everything is clean. Love the food and the service."}
{"text":"Chips, salsa and bean dip here are to die for. The food at Serrano's has always been amazing at all locations. The staff is always friendly. The burritos are delicious and fairly priced. Make sure to get them enchilada style."}
{"text":"My favorite part of this place will always be the salsa.  I love it!  

The food though, I'd agree it's so so at best.  Last night was my first time here as a vegetarian, I ordered the Veggie Quasadilla, it was alright really a bit greasy from the cheese for my taste.  It really was nothing more then some shredded cheese diced up tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos.  It was not bad, but not great.  

Prices are great, we had 4 adults and a child for around $50, my husband ordered a chimichanga which he said was good, my grandmother also had the chimichanga and she enjoyed it.  My mom had a taco/enchilada/tostada combo.  The tostada was rubbery but everything else she said was good.  Guacamole was alright, huge chunks of avocado which I enjoy but not much in way of flavors beyond the avocado.

All in all we'll return again, we've been here tons of times but it's certainly not the best Mexican in the valley."}
{"text":"I love this little place, I have been here several times and they never cease to impress me.  At first, one thinks that they are entering the average, everyday taco shop but at Serrano's, they take care of you.  After you enter, if you're not sure what you would like to eat, you can have a seat instead of ordering at the counter and the server will bring you a menu and chips with salsa while you read it over.  They will take your order at either the counter or your table and they have an awesome little salsa bar.  The Flan is amazing.  I highly recommend this place to everyone looking for a little taco shop with an extra flare of class.  Definitely a step above the rest."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but the atmosphere leaves something to be desired. If you're in the neighborhood and want the full-on experience, I'd head to Tia Rosa's."}
{"text":"Mexican pizza was incredible and their fried ice cream amazing ... overall great dinner and service."}
{"text":"great food at the right price. Our server was excellent. Shrimp enchiladas are a must! we also enjoyed an asada enchilada and a birria taco"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today.  Service was good, but the place was empty, so hard to say what it's like if they were crushed.  

Anyway,everything was cooked ok. It was typical Mexican fair right out off a Sysco truck.  Nothing homemade except maybe the salsa that came with obvious manufactured chips. 

Paid $15.99 for a single serving of Chicken fajitas which had no sour cream, no cheese, a tiny bit of pico, and only two tortillas.  The chicken was cooked but bland.  

All in all, not that great, but not horrible.  I suppose if u were seriously craving Mexican this would do in a pinch.   Otherwise, I'm sure there is better.  

It is a chain as well, so I guess my expectations might have been too high."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp! I found this place on Yelp and am very satisfied. Food is yummy. We came at prime time and they were very busy, when we ordered they let us know the wait will be about 15 mins and asked if that was ok because everything is cooked to order and they were busy. Great friendly customer service. If I'm ever back in this area I would be sure to stop on again."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to me so I decided to go for dinner. When I entered I decided to sit at the bar. Since I was alone and the World Series game was on it seemed like a good opportunity. I have a way of telling whether not service will be fair, good, or excellent, and I could tell that service here was going to be about average or possibly a little lower than average. My waitress was the bartender, and she wasn't immediately attentive to my needs, but she did service me in a timely fashion. The front of the menu has the history of the family on it, and there's a typo, so when you're reading it makes you wonder about the attention to detail. For Mexican food their pricing overall is pretty high. The menu was not well thought out, and you don't feel like there's an opportunity for you to save a few dollars if you want to unless possibly you just order off of the side menu, which wasn't readily apparent. I had to ask if chips and salsa we're going to be served instead of it automatically being brought to me when I sat down at the table which is normally the custom at a Mexican food restaurant. Water was not offered to me either. I took a while to decide on the menu and finally decided on the combination plate having an enchilada and a taco with shredded pork. They serve the chips and salsa along with refried beans, and the chips are very fresh, thin, and salted very well and taste very good. The combination of chips and salsa and the refried beans is excellent and something they're known for. It's easy to over eat with the chips and salsa and refried beans before your meal is served. I could tell that my meal had probably stayed in the kitchen for a little while since it wasn't immediately served to me in the time that I would've anticipated it and the busyness of the restaurant. With Mexican food restaurants you can tell when the food is served to you whether or not the chef is passionate about their work. There's a fine line in Mexican food restaurants for food service and the food that is served, and I find that that fine line is here at this restaurant because that's how I feel that they are treading. They are treading on a fine line because their food is neither excellent nor really that bad. I suppose that you can have a business that's built on being average, and there are quite a few businesses that operate that way. I like to think the businesses are always striving to improve and to improve customer service. When things tend to turn in the opposite direction I think it's the time that the business needs to evaluate their operations and take time to train their staff accordingly and evaluate the quality of their food. This restaurant fits those criteria and gets three stars from me. It wasn't a bad recommendation, but I'm not certain how soon I'll be back. I think the one thing that I would say in closing is that if you come here just plan to take some time and have a little extra time and don't worry so much about all the details and just really enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"The food here is solid. The customer service is 5+ stars. Very friendly and attentive to customer needs. Checked in with me several times to see if I needed anything. They are not really a full service restaurant but they put restaurants that are to shame. I have been a few times first time got the carne asada burrito dry. It was excellent.  They serve complimentary tortilla chips and they have a great selection at the home made salsa bar. Second time I got the chili fries I knew they were different so I wanted to try them. Again very good mix of flavors and a huge serving. Washed it all down with delicious horchata. A great choice for Mexican food. They take pride in what they serve and how they serve it,it shows and I'm sold...will return as much as possible !!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic fresh food with great prices, staff is super friendly, and you know it's an awesome Mexican food when you walk in and see Mexican families eating there, I got a taco salad and asked for Seabass in it which was off the menu but they did it anyways and it was delicious.  Definitely coming back:)"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! !! Wonderful family and they have great food TOO!!! Everything is amazing, you really can't go wrong, they even make tamales."}
{"text":"Just finished a late lunch with my bride.  Wonderful experience. Our waiter Isaias recommended the Smothered Fries.  Goes well with a beer or margarita!"}
{"text":"When I tell bomb af it's bomb af! I had the Mexican pizza added rice. Very delish! Multiple salsa options and the customer service is the main reason I will be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best taco shops ever! Conveniently located off the freeway, good food, good family!"}
{"text":"Just back from our second visit.  Serrano's is a wonderfully small, cheery, friendly, tasty neighborhood spot that would be really easy to miss in its otherwise seemingly abandoned shopping center. Do not, however, miss it: This place is the consummate local small business--the antithesis of the corporate, identical-from-coast-to-coast, mass-produced chain restaurant. It's a pleasure to be able to eat a delicious, inexpensive meal here while simultaneously knowing that you're truly supporting the local economy."}
{"text":"I wanted to find a tasty little homemade style Mexican spot and I think I found my place! 

My MIL and I tried this place on a random whim and it's quickly become one of our spots. 

She always gets enchiladas with green sauce vs the regular red enchilada. Its her go- to at Mexican spots, and they make it well here. I like to try different things though. I've had enchiladas as well (with shrimp or chicken for me) and like their green sauce too. I've gotten the carnitas if you like a meaty big chunk version of this. Ceviche tostada is piled high for the $3.50 with fish and shrimp and really citrusy, but get some hot sauce from the salsa bar and it's good (get it with mayo spread on the tostada). I think so far my favorite item is the birria. It took a while to find some place that makes this fork tender. It is super good. 

The salsa bar has 5 different sauces, carrot and chiles, this awesome pickled cabbage, white beans. The salsas lean a bit more spicy than the average place, which makes me happy! You get some chips when you sit down. Then prepare for food that someone would make you at home. Everything here is definitely homemade and not phoned in. 

They are super friendly here as well. 

Im a fan, I think I will go try to eat through the menu as my MIL has been asking for the enchiladas often."}
{"text":"We felt so lonely for home when we moved here in 05.  Found this place by accident. Now I can honestly say I feel like a party of the family.  I fell in love with the food and bring my whole family here.  I dont really care for the menudo or the tamales (sorry Mr Serrano) my son gets the quesadilla with carne asada and fries. Mom gets the caldo de res, hubby gets chile colorado. I get the taquitos. Everything is really good ...if I had ever had a problem with the food, I just tell Mr or Mrs Serrano and they fix it quick fast and in a hurry for me.  Try it, and if you dont like it they will make it right.  As soon as I go back to Vegas...Im going to say hello and have dinner with my adopted extended family."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I had the wet burrito which was good, and they had a nice salsa bar and comped chips with a wide variety of salsa.  They had a unlimited drink bar with a lot of sodas and authentic mexican drinks!   Ill probably try the plates next time and the fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican, I was craving some home style food from California, as we were there for the weekend. We got there just as it opened and the owner of the restaurant happened to be there. She was lovely, made us feel comfortable and right at home. We even got into a good conversation about food, and it's authenticity (which is so rare to find even in California where I'm from). I had the chilaquiles and they were crispy and had flavor to it, just like I like it! Everything tasted delicious!  The price point wasn't bad at all. Whenever we visit Las Vegas this restaurant will be one of the first places I stop and dine at."}
{"text":"To start the Rio Margarita is awesome.
Im gonna order the pollo ranchero fundido style cause its the bomb! Great food great service all the time!"}
{"text":"Good food and really nice people! Love their chicken and rice soup - especially with the hot sauce they serve with it! Yummy!"}
{"text":"To start off, the bartender and the drinks were great. The bartender was friendly and on top of everything. We ordered two different enchiladas and they were ok. Up until one of our dishes had chunks of charcoal that wasn't found until it was already in the mouth. Completely ruined the meal and it was disgusting. Likely not coming back because of that."}
{"text":"I've being going to Serrano's for years and I've never had a problem with their food. They serve all of the traditional Mexican dishes that you would find at any Mexican restaurant. I've tried a lot of their menu items but I'd have to say my favorite go to plate is the shredded beef or \"machaca\" chimichanga. It is especially good when you get it enchilada style which is smothered in red sauce. It comes with a helpful serving of rice and beans too. 
What I really like about Serrano's is that they are one of the few Mexican restaurants in the valley that still serves free chips with not only salsa but bean dip as well."}
{"text":"My bf and I decided to try Serrano's because it is very close to where we live and based on the previously good review on Yelp. It is a hole in the wall with decent prices and good service, but the food was so BLAH! I may be biased having grown up with homemade Mexican food, but I find it very hard to make flavorless Mexican food, which this was. I had the menudo which was was neither good nor bad, until I got sick on it. My bf had a carne asada burrito which he said was \"ok.\" We both agreed that the chips were not good at all; seriously, how many Mexican places make crappy chips? VERY few. The salsa bar was also quite sad.

Serrano's redeeming qualities are its good service, the fact that they make their food upon ordering, and its horchata. The blandness and fact that I got sick are enough to make me not eat there again though."}
{"text":"Ate at their Gilbert & McKellips location last night.  It was the worst Mexican I have ever had.  I ordered Shrimp Fajitas.  They brought me beef fajitas.  

The frozen margarita was weak with bland taste.  

We were with a group who spent a lot of money.  My food was the last to come out and it was not what I ordered.  There were no apologies.  We lived in CA for 35 years and know what good Mexican should be.

Seranos is is a chain which has bad management which shows through waiters who cannot get it right.

The worst experience ever and the food I got was awful.  I could not eat it!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little family owned business! Their food is fantastic and the folks who run it are so nice. I Am fortunate to work in the same plaza as them so I  get to enjoy their food all the time. They recently catered lunch for our office, and did a great job. This place is the best and all of our employees eat here constantly."}
{"text":"5 stars for every employee we have had been helped by here. They are always so nice and helpful and come to your table to check on you.  I am not totally crazy about Mexican food but it is a good option since I don't eat meat but what I have had there has always been very good and fresh and my kids and husband LOVE this place.  The chips and everything from the salsa bar are really good.  The place is clean and Grandbaby likes all of the decorations, it keeps him entertained with looking around.  Definitely a must try if you haven't been here yet."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place and a real family owned business. They serve generous portions and are extremely friendly! The best part is the fantastic flan and I was told that this was a recipe that has been in their family for 30 years. This is an authentic Mexican restaurant with great food. Try it - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The only good thing I can say about this place is the bean dip is good. Cold food, no flavor, and crappy service."}
{"text":"After years of business trips to Vegas, I finally, FINALLY, found an authentic Mexican restaurant. While it is pretty much necessary to have a car to get to this restaurant from the strip, it's worth the short drive if you don't want a gringo nacho platter like you find on the strip. This is a family-owned restaurant with a fresh-made salsa bar and entrees that taste like they come from Mexico. I had awesome fish tacos for lunch, and the flan for dessert was superb! The restaurant is by no means fancy, and is in fact a casual spot within a strip mall area. If you've got a nudge for real Mexican food though, this is the place."}
{"text":"I'm here from Los Angeles, ca. The service was great. Very attentive n greet you at the moment you come. I tasted the the tacos where delicious n meat felt fresh. But the menudo felt a bit greasy I took it home. The menudo really didn't have to much flavor. Not enough chili or spices. But I would recommend this place if what some Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is just run by idiots. Every single time we get food here for take out, we are reminded of this. They get the order wrong every time, they over charge us every time, and the portions are absolutely tiny and absurd every time. GO TO BAJA JOE'S ACROSS THE STREET INSTEAD. I'm done giving this place a chance!!!! They wanted to charge us for salsa after we ordered $40 worth of food. Seriously? And $11 for chips? And $6 for a bowl of soup that was half full? Don't waste your time or money!!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was fantastic!  Little hole in the wall with great food and great service!  The Carne Asada Fries were so good, not like your typical type with Carne Asada, cheese and enchilada sauce.  The taco salad was really good as well.  Hubby had the sausage Breakfast burrito smothered in enchilada sauce, very good portions.  There is a salsa bar with four different types of salsa as well marinated garbanzo beans and a so yummy concoction of cabbage, carrots and jalapeños.  Fountain drinks are self serve.  The young guy that helped us, can't remember his name, was super friendly and efficient.  He also told us the history of the restaurant.  It's not a super fancy place to eat so don't expect to be wined and dined but for more of a taqueria style restaurant we were very impressed.  We will definitely be back soon! Keep Yelpin Y'all!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food and best customer service closest thing to mexican home cooking... my to go for menudo.. has been around for years.. best mom n pops Mexican restraunt"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food.  Blown away by the amazing salsa bar.  Authentic!!  Excellent burritos and huevos rancheros.  Best we ever had.  Worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"this friendly family owned establishment is a hidden gem.  honestly mexican food is not my first choice of desired foods to eat. but their chicken enchiladas, and carne asada mexican pizza, have never been a disappointment."}
{"text":"Two words: Bean. Dip.  That's what basically makes this place the bomb, let's be honest."}
{"text":"My family has been eating at Sarrano's since I was a little girl! It's definitely a favorite. The machaca beef is so delicious. We have never had a wait and the food comes so fast! I've always had great service here too. We love it!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been visiting this location for years.  The Wait Staff is always a joy to talk to and we really like the service we receive.  

Serrano's has a temporary menu that is full of yummy goodness.  Any good business knows you need to change things up a bit to keep things interesting and I always find something new to try on the menu.  

If you are looking for a fun time and some addictive chips and salsa this is the place to try."}
{"text":"Went on a date with my best friend. We both LOVE Mexican food and hole in the wall restaurants and this qualifies as both! I got the shrimp quesadilla with tomatoes in it, and should have passed on the tomato as it made it really soggy, but it was LOADED with shrimp and the price was delightful! The cashier only charged me .50 for a small scoop of guac which was nice. My bff got the chicken fajita and loved them. This place does pretty quick pickup orders and I can see myself calling in for that quesadilla in the future. It was fantastic. Great service as well."}
{"text":"amazing food in a casual atmosphere. always friendly and accommodating. fresh sauces, authentic, my mouth is watering thinking about it."}
{"text":"I love Serrano's!  I finally ate at the only Serrano's in town that I hadn't been to.  Salsa's the same as every location. THE BEST!   The rest of the food is good but I go here specifically for  my favorite chips & salsa.  They're included for free and they come with bean dip too.  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I randomly stopped here when I was looking for a quick bite after seeing their sign from the street. Looks like a family shop. Service is friendly and fast and food is good and prices reasonable. Their salsa bar has several original Mexican sides. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I found this hidden gem as I was on my way to train. The tortilla chips and salsa were fresh and crispy. I ordered the Birria and sometimes this dish comes too dry even though the meat is pulled it was still succulent. Rice and beans were perfect and the price is on point. 

Definitely coming back here for the menudo and Chimichanga next!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet.....food, service, and very friendly staff are top drawer.  I love their salsa bar and their menudo is superb.  Combination plates are very reasonable. They also have a soda and drink bar."}
{"text":"We had a most marvellous time eating a wonderful dinner last night. I love the whole fried fish fish tacos so popular in Mexico. They make them on request for only $10.99 includes 4 tortillas of your choosing, beverage and all the fixings. Loved the great salsa bar too, also included. 

Just could not be happier. If this was a big fancy place it would be packed always at twice the prices. Loved it."}
{"text":"The only thing I can say about this place is the bean dip is good, hot food, tons of flavor, and excellent service. I always sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Food was horrible, my tostada was soggy the time it got to my table, the taco was bland and the enchilada sauce tasted straight out of a can. Customer service was good just horrible food"}
{"text":"I loved this little hole in the wall. Food was authentic Mexican food not sure from what region, but reminded me of Durango homey taste. (crispy tamale leaf from comal) The place was clean and friendly. Prices were reasonable. Food was delicious and there is a salsa bar."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time eating at this location of Serrano's, even though I have been to another location once. This place is pretty average mexican food, nothing mind blowing. What I like about it is that they give you free bean dip and they use fairly high quality ingredients. I got a shredded chicken burrito fundido.... now, usually shredded chicken is not too good at these kinds of place, but this one was very good. They seasoned it and everything... not just bland shredded chicken. So that was pleasant. The BF and I also shared a very good margarita cupcake :-) My only complaint is that this place is a little expensive for what you get. So I would come back when I'm in the mood for solid mexican food."}
{"text":"We have gone to this restaurant for 20 plus years and we have never had to wait 2 1/2 hours to get our dinner.  The excuse was we are really busy  
tonight. Well we watched people come in after us and gets their food before us and leave before our food ever hit the table. Ask for the Manager twice, bEfore he showed up at our table and. Couldn't give a reasonable explanation, the waitress kept saying that there were tickets all over the kitchen and it was very busy back there.  Waited and waited and all the staff would say, was we can give you a free dessert, well we hadn't even got our dinner yet. Finally got our dinner, it was fine,  UT really! 2 1/2 hours to just our dinner??"}
{"text":"This is a must visit little hole in the wall. 
This is authentic if that's what you're looking for. 

 The food is delicious, the employees are super friendly and nice. The place is pretty clean and the food choices are plentiful.  
If you're in the neighborhood stop in and at least try a taco!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars rounded up to 3.  Average food, average prices, average service.  Nothing I've tried has been outstanding, nor has anything been disappointing.  Convenient for lunch so we come semi-regularly.  You can do better, and you can do a helluva lot worse when going out for Mexican food."}
{"text":"This Serrano's locale  just didn't make the cut for me . . . 

PROS: the chips, salsa and bean dip, of course!  Service was friendly, and the staff appear busy and focused, which I like.

CONS: the margaritas are, in a word, lame.  Whoever mixes up the marg machine to accommodate the house margarita (vice the specialty margs) needs to add some tequila to the mixture WITHOUT the use of an eye dropper.  Seriously, I hate being charged for an alcoholic beverage when I can detect no alcohol in my drink. For all I know, I was having a lime slushy . . . we came to a 50% full restaurant on a Friday at 7:00 p.m., and after we ordered, our meal took a full 25 minutes to get to our table.  Everyone else seemed to wait a maximum of 10 minutes.  No explanation from our friendly waitress . . . I got the ground beef chimmy, and the meat just didn't have that much flavor, and the tortilla lacked crispness for a meal that was supposed to be fried

Not much more to say . . . 

Cheers!
RS"}
{"text":"I'm surprised no one has wrote a review about this little hole in the wall. They have great food in a nice atmosphere. Great homemade food here. I have had some Albondigas here that was great. Nice big portions. It's Perfect!!!

If you're not in the mood for Mexican they have burgers here which I also had which were surprisingly good. If you feel like breakfast and not Mexican they have Kids Pancakes which again I also ordered and I wouldn't necessarily consider Kids as they were huge. Nice taste and not some cheap microwaved pancake that McDonalds serves you."}
{"text":"i don't have to mention how good the chips, salsa and bean dip are here but i do have to tell you the flour tortillas are to die for!   i am seriously thinking about just ordering a stack of those next time!  The beef machacha is much better then the chicken, the pollo ranchero is def a favorite,  and my boyfriend says the chile relleno is delicious.  Service is awesome and the margs are strong!  check this place out :)"}
{"text":"Addictive bean dip and irresistible salsa--and that's just the free appetizer as you explore the menu. The special quesadilla with chicken is a decent portion with marinated chicken, Mexican seasoning, and sides of guac and sour cream. I also recommend the hard shell tacos and oh-so-honey-sweet fried iced cream. Great value (can easily keep it under $15, even $10 per person), consistent quality and authentic goodness."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 6 years. I love authentic home made feel mexican food and I would like to say this spot is. Unlike those other fancy mexican spots their food really have no flavor at all. This by far beats robertos and pepes hands down. Service is great and food is always on point."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was young. The food has been mostly great. The service is always great and the staff is nice. Their mini appetizer platter is delicious and I usually eat it as a meal. I live in Tennessee now and absolutely miss this place!!!"}
{"text":"Lucky find for Friday night dinner!!  Little store front in a shopping center near Harbor Freight. Very authentic tasting food. Chips were awesome and the salsa was very fresh.  The chili relleno and cheese enchilada was awesome!  The sauce was the best I've had in a while!  Friendly fast service.  Great prices. The speakers are a little loud but that's not a big deal.  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, and have made it almost a weekly lunch spot since I work close by. 

The food is awesome and the service is impeccable. 

I will agree with some of the other reviewers that the chips are not the greatest, but I'd rather have a good meal then good chips any day. 

The Basa filet and albondigas are staples for me. But the beef tongue tacos are excellent as well."}
{"text":"Sadly, this 20-year neighborhood favorite has closed.  The family decided to not renew their lease AT THIS LOCATION.  The remaining six East Valley locations remain open."}
{"text":"I was on a fish taco quest.  Multiple places later, I have found my spot.   Serrano's is clean, people are friendly, tacos and salsa bar excellent.  Everything tasted fresh.  I had both the shrimp tacos and their fish tacos, and everything came out generously topped and piping hot.  Wanting to make sure it wasn't a fluke, I went back the next day for the deuce.  Just as delicious! And now I am craving more as I write this review."}
{"text":"Tried this location due to a recommendation from family.  Small place located in a stop mall, run by a family.  Food is fresh, plentiful and economical.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night and nothing tasted very fresh. The bean dip, the beef, and the pork all had an off taste to them. The meat portions also were very dry like you would expect from old reheated food. Everything else was just okay. Makes you wonder if they bother tasting anything first. Definitely not worth the money spent on a family outing when there are many other choices available in the area (Yes even filibertos is much better than this)."}
{"text":"Chips kinda blow, as does the salsa...  But the customer service was pretty kick ass... it was only three tables an a couple of take outs.. but they paid attention and I have paid a lot more for what we got... Menudo... my moms is the best hands down... but I liked this one... they give you enough pepper and lemon t make it taste good. the siete mares aka 7 seas was kinda weak ,but for under 10 bucks it was good!"}
{"text":"This was our second time at a Serrano's. The first time was the one on Power and Southern and we were blown away with the customer service and the food was hot, tasty and came out quickly. The staff was very attentive and even the manager came out and asked how everything was. Go to that one instead of this one on McKellips and Gilbert rd. It took ten minutes to even order drinks. It just got worse from there. Our food was warm and sloppily on our plates. Then after waiting ten minutes to pay we just brought the check up and paid. They weren't that busy but the wait staff looked over worked and like they hated their job. We will not be returning to this location. I gave two stars because the food wasn't too terrible and this place would be good if you don't care about waiting too long for anything."}
{"text":"If a restaurant isn't crowded on a Friday night, there's a reason.  I know this rule, but for some reason I chose to ignore it.

So the good...salsa and bean dip they bring with the chips.

The bad...
- The menus were falling apart...not a tough thing to fix if someone in leadership is paying attention.
- Chips were greasy...way more than they should have been
- We asked for sliced avocado...they were out.  How does a Mexican restaurant run out of avocado?
- Fish tacos were absolutely unremarkable
- The \"slaw\" on the fish tacos was several orders of magnitude less remarkable than the fish tacos themselves
- I'm still trying to identify the tortilla the fish tacos were served in.
- Tamales...less than meh

Overall I'd say they just quit trying."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel at home. I will be coming back maybe bringing my parents and grandparents. Come and feel like home"}
