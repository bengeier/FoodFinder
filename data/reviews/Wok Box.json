{"text":"Ok for fast food Asian.  It's like the McDonalds of Asian/Indian food.  Nice marketting, perfect for those who are not too savvy of  this type of cuisine, decently clean place with fresh enough food.  Perfect for the fast fix, yet if you are wanting an authentic experience, There are many other places in the city that are MUCH more authentic (try the NE) and within the same price point.  For what it is, it's not bad."}
{"text":"Wok Box is a wonderful idea, in theory. The restaurant itself is very clean and hip looking. We decided to try it out for a healthier option other than the next door and very delicious burger option. I will say the portions are a good size and one noodle bowl can feed two. Anyhow, the noodles my husband ordered were very thin and tasted like top ramen. Top Ramen would have more flavor, though. My dish came with Udon noodles, which is a better option. The teriyaki chicken came with an odd combination of vegetables that did not taste good with the flavorless sauce. The biggest issue with both items was the large amount of flavorless liquid swirling around in each dish. Even though the teriyaki chicken should have a different flavor profile than the plum sauce dish my husband had, they tasted the same. Bleh."}
{"text":"Worst \"asian\" fusion place there pad Thai isn't even pad Thai... It taste nothing like the real deal. Thought it would be cool to try a small portion but worst decision I've made in my life."}
{"text":"The butter chicken was delicious, but I ruined my lunch by ordering the cheesy kimchi fire ball. *facepalm Stay away from them I almost lost my lunch. I will go back and give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"First impression: food was tasty, very fresh and much healthier than other lunch options.  Service was quick and polite. I felt the portion sizes were small for the price but not unreasonable.  This is Asian fusion, or as i call it \"white people Asian food\". It's not going to satisfy a purist but that's not the aim. Everyone will find something on the menu that they like.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place no flavour... And I was wondering why there was nobody there at supper time. Now I know"}
{"text":"I ordered the Sweet Mongolian noodle box, Dan Dan noodle box, and one order of gyoza to go.  I received the Dan Dan noodle box and 2 orders of gyoza, and sadly, did not discover the mistake until I was already home.  If it were not the holiday season, I would've gone back to get my order corrected, but the mall is a mad house at this time of year, so I ended up just having gyoza for dinner that night.  I should've read the description more carefully because it says \"5 crispy chicken gyoza pieces\" and had I noticed the \"crispy\" part, I would not have ordered it because I prefer steamed gyoza.  However, I will say that the citrus soy sauce was tasty.  The Dan Dan noodle box was for my husband.  It is described as \"extra spicy\" which is why he chose it.  He said that while it was spicy, it was just that - spicy for the sake of being spicy, but not adding anything to the overall flavor.  Even with our less than stellar experience, I would like to give the place another shot.  There are several items on their menu that are of interest; I just hope I get what I order next time!"}
{"text":"As a medically diagnosed celiac, finding good gluten-free restaurants is necessary. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. Sure, they are tasty, I'm willing to spend the extra $ for health(ier) fast-food, they have a nicely marked menu as items that do not contain wheat, and separate pans/tongs for special dietary requirements.  So what's the problem?? Cross-contamination. It's very clear the staff has not been properly educated on food allergies, which is very disappointing because Wok Box is so close to being there! Here's where they disappoint: (1) the separate \"GF\" wok & tongs are crudely scrubbed inbetween uses with the bamboo brush they use to clean all the other, gluten-laden pans, before it's hung back up on the wall (not cleaned properly) and (2) they parboil their veggies to speed up the cooking process in a big pot of water in the centre of the stove, but if you watch closely, they throw in all of their wheat-based noodles into the same water to cook them and there is no separation.  Sadly, I have noticed this at a few Wok Boxes..."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. I ordered the Veggie Dun Dun Box. It was so delicious!  Perfect amount of spice, not too overpowering. I would suggest to anyone to at least try it! It was made to order and came out in about 5 minutes during the lunch rush!  I will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I believe it was the owners that made my chicken teriyaki , it was truly the best made dish yet , and I eat the chicken teriyaki noodle bowl all the time! I will continue going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here a few nights ago and wish I would have read the other yelp reviews before deciding to eat here.  We were going to hit Kona Grill for happy hour, but the bar was packed and so we decided to eat here since we never been here before.  The menu was set up similar to a Pei Wei style menu (different flavor combinations served with beef, chicken, shrimp, tofu, or double vegetables).  Each of them are served with noodles or the noodles can be substituted for white or brown rice.  I went with the allegedly \"very spicy\" dan dan noodles with marinated steak, and my wife got the sweet Mongolian chicken.  We both upgraded to a \"combo\" meaning we got a drink and two spring rolls for $2.49 extra.  I also got breaded chicken tenders for my boys.   The dan dan noodles were very bland and only slightly spiced with sambal chili sauce which did little to add any flavor other than spice to the dish.  I found myself reaching for anything on the table to add flavor (sriracha, soy sauce, and lime juice) which helped but still was missing something.  The marinated steak had some flavor to it, but many pieces were cut with the grain which made them extra tough to chew.  My wife's Mongolian chicken was just as bland, the only difference between the two dishes was slightly spicy vs. slightly sweet.  The spring rolls were clearly frozen and not made in house as the little vegetables were soggy.  The best thing I ate were my sons' chicken tenders, crunchy and tender.  Wish I would have gotten a bowl of those instead.  Service was nice and helpful which saved it from being a 1 star.  Expected more from a chain restaurant .  With all the other great restaurants in the San Tan Mall, we would visit again anytime soon."}
{"text":"They say Wok Box, I say \"Crock Box\".  As in it's a crock of s**t.   What they're charging for their bland brand of Asian favourites, that is.   My lady and I had high hopes when we picked up her Pad Thai and my Szechwan Pepper stirfry.  Those hopes were quickly dashed, however, when we got home and found the two to be virtually indistinguishable from each other.  Moreover, there was hardly any chicken in either of our stirfrys.  Sure, they offer a double meat option, but that would be an additional $4 per meal, which would take the total price to over $30 with no beverages.  That's just WAY too much for subpar fast food.   That being said, the dudes working there were exceedingly friendly and the restaurant itself was impeccably clean and comfortable.  As an added bonus, they serve their food in the classic Chinese takeout boxes you always see in movies set in NYC.  It's just too bad that the friendly people and the sparking restaurant are filling their cool boxes with such filth.   The Wok Box is proof positive that if you want great Asian food, be it Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese or Japanese, you should pass on this generalist and go directly to the specialists."}
{"text":"The food does not have much flavor. They messed up our orders and the protein and veggies are scarce in the large bowl of noodles. Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I got a coupon so decided to try this place out with my sister. I take her here & walked in and we were over-taken by the overwhelming bad smell of a skunk or maybe rotten food...? We decided to order the Fire Cracker with jasmine rice which was Highly talked about by the cashier. & my sister got the pho soup. We waited about 20 minutes for our food, which seemed very long for fast food. When we finally got our meals My firecracker had rotten veggies on top. I decided to move around the veggies and just try to make the best of the situation. Well the rice was mushy and gummy, there was only 3 or 4 pieces of shrimp, and the food tasted sour. My sister had OILY soup! there was so much oil in it. The noodles were hard. We couldn't even eat it without gagging.  I asked to speak with the manager lady who later came out looking Half-Asleep. She offered to re-cook our meals to which we declined... The girl started laughing when I said I wanted a refund.  I was so embarrassed that I choose this place. Save your money ...You will leave feeling sick."}
{"text":"I am consistently impressed with the quality of the customer service I receive at this location. The staff are very friendly, helpful, and man, can they cook! The food not only tastes excellent, but they have a selection that accommodates most dietary restrictions (e.g. vegetarian, gluten free, dairy free).  The price is decent - it's not cheap, but it's not expensive, and you definitely get your money's worth.  I recommend  the Pad Thai with ribbon noodles - I haven't been let down yet!  Once again, kudos to the staff! I always leave smiling. :-)"}
{"text":"Americana Asian food that's mediocre at best. The ambiance and decor are nice but the food and customer service aren't great.  We got the padthai and firecracker.  Padthai had zero flavor even and the firecracker was only a little better.  Definitely NOT spicy, even after dousing the padthai with siracha.  Noodles were a bit too al dente, as well.  The veggies are fresh though and the spring rolls were decent, although they forgot to include them when we picked up our order.  Speaking of that, the dude called out our number and another number so I went to the counter to pick up our food and he denied calling our number and acted perturbed that I was at the counter.  Go to firehouse subs next door and don't waste your hard earned money on this place."}
{"text":"Food is good but make sure to ask for easy sauce. All their dishes come with globs of sauce that is at the bottom of the bowl. There is no other rice bowl places is this area besides YC's. Gave 3 star because like YC's better and food comes with too much sauce. Will return but won't venture far into their menu besides ordering the teriyaki chicken bowl."}

{"text":"Service is always fast and easy.  It's not high end fo9d just good and fresh.  We've never had any issues with folks there, always pleasant and helpful.  A couple times wrong noodles or something slightly different than ordered but all in all good, tasty and fast.  I have an almost full punch card. Ha"}
{"text":"OMG!!! So worth the price. I had the Indian Butter Chicken Rice Box with the Cheesy Kimchi Fire balls and my boss had the Breaded Lemon Chicken Rice Box. We found our meals to be very flavorful. Well Done!!!"}
{"text":"Never again! Chipped bowl with the chip left In the food. The drain under the soda machine was backed up and the placed smelled like sewer. Two workers on duty were more interested in their phones, than ensuring the food is good or the place was clean. Avoid until they fix the issues."}
{"text":"This place sucks, what a waste of my money. Threw the meal away after my first bite. Even their iced tea was bad."}
{"text":"The first time my husband and I tried this place, it was actually quite delicious! However, when I came back with my kids most recently, I was very disappointed! They were obviously short staffed, which was unfortunate, so everything took longer than expected. My dish was lacking in vegetables big time (and I'm a vegetarian so that's no good!) and hardly had any sauce. I paid an extra dollar for each kids meal to get noodles instead of rice, and the noodles were one big stuck together bowl of noodles that they could hardly eat! But the part that bothered me the most was when they literally charged me an extra DOLLAR for a small cup of sauce for my sons kids meal. He didn't like the sauce that came with his dish, but even after explaining that, they still charged me. I just think it's poor customer service to nickel and dime people like that! Not sure we will return, unfortunately!"}
{"text":"This isn't food.  The ordering system is ultra confusing, somewhat expensive for what you get, and just plain terrible."}
{"text":"New place that opened up so I decided to try it for lunch. Menu was basically stirfry asian food ranging from Indian to Korean and soups and salads.  Place was clean and contemporary and a lot of unique menu items such as dan dan noodles and black bean which aren't very common. Food though was disappointing. My wife had the wor wonton soup and I had the beef bulgogi stirfry. Veggies were fresh but both were plain on flavour and quite expensive for the portion. Another thing was the lack of trays, so when we were called up to get our food, we had to make several trips by carrying each bowl and had to deal with the challenge of spilling. Should have just gone to Edo"}
{"text":"This restaurant is terrible. My noodles are as dry as a fat girls phone and I had to force my way through a crowd of people to refill my drink. The cashier looked like Nigma and was equally as weird. I spent most of my time eating looking for a piece of chicken in my mess they call noodles. The only reason I went to this restaurant was because chipotle was closed. Gross."}
{"text":"Had the Shanghai Cashew chicken and thought it was good.  The veggies were fresh and the flavor was decent.  Not spicy as they say but still good.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Just found my favorite new restaurant ,friendly staff , very healthy & Price is reasonable . Totally recommend it"}
{"text":"If you're really paying attention to this review, do NOT eat here.  Honestly, this is the worst supposed \"Chinese\" food I've ever had.  The service was awful, having to wait 20 minutes for food while the cashier kept saying \"sorry, sorry\" all the while there was 5 or 6 people ahead of my buddy and I (that's busy?) I've eaten better food at a Chinese food place in a bad neighborhood that advertises $3 meals all the while the chef is in the back with a cigarette hanging out off his mouth, ya' know? Any way, I'm really sorry, but if I don't get sick from this place, I'll be surprised. Never again."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant on a busy Saturday for lunch.  It should have been a clue to us that all the surrounding restaurants were packed, but Wok Box had no wait at all.  Our three dishes came out indistinguishable from one another.  It took us a few bites and switching plates to figure out whose was whose.  The flavor on all three were bland.  My sister ended up with paper packet pieces in hers.  The staff apologized and acknowledged it was a wrapper that ended up in her dish.  They gave us the money back for hers.  Overall the staff was friendly, but the food was not good at all."}
{"text":"Great staff with typical Wok Box food. The staff is what makes this place great though it also helps that the service is incredibly fast."}
{"text":"I love this little spot. Quick and fresh and a super friendly staff. Wish they would do coupons or loyalty card or something. Seems a bit pricy for what it is but it's delicious."}
{"text":"Meh... It's okay. This was my first time going and I got a noodle bowl - I don't remember what they called it but the sauce was sriracha peanut. This is what they recommended to me, and it actually sounded pretty good so I was excited. I wouldn't call it horrible, but the flavor really just isn't all that great. It's hard to put my finger on it... I guess it has sort of a mildly spicy, almost charcoal bbq smokey flavor to it. I probably won't be coming back for more, but I definitely won't judge their entire menu from my one experience."}
{"text":"Love the food, really friendly staff, genuinely good customer service... Not that fake bs you get at so many places these days."}
{"text":"My kids loved it! Do I have to say any more..  My wife went Singapore cashew and I went butter chicken. Food was quick. Staff were nice. Will be back"}
{"text":"Before we even place our order the girl tells me they have no vegetables but will give us extra noodles.  What??  How the heck can you have no vegetables at an asian food place?  So then I decide to order the Firecracker.  I choose pork because it already has bacon listed as an ingredient. She tells me they no longer serve pork,  yes they know it's still on the menu, but no they do not serve pork anymore.  Again I have to ask, how can you call yourself an Asian food place when you do not serve pork!!??   Walked out and had Chipotle next door.   Would give this place ZERO stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Asian fusion, an upscale Panda Express perhaps?   Nah, it's better than that.   We come here for the Pho and Pad Thai. My kids love their dragon chicken. We've tried just about everything on their menu.   The owners are sweet and the people who work here are nice too. Always more than enough food if you order a family feast. I would just suggest if you get a rice box to get the rice on the side because if you get the Mongolian Beef the"}
{"text":"The food is great, the service questionable. The staff is not trained properly and does not have any customer service skills. It is unfortunate that a great offering is ruined so badly by the service being offered."}
{"text":"The food is horrible. I even went twice in hopes that maybe I just had bad luck the first time. The second time was just as bad as the first. I had the Pad Thai, Pho & Kids jungle noodles. The atmosphere was nice though & it was quick, so there's that."}
{"text":"Standard wok place. My experience was that the udon noodles were mushy, there was hardly any chicken in my bowl and they have the fake syrup iced tea. The only two positives I've got are the fresh vegetables and the fast, friendly service. I won't likely go back."}
{"text":"This place offers both eat-in and take out options. It's clean and the service is quick. It might be a little too quick... While reading the menu, I was asked 3 times in the span of about 2 minutes if I needed help or was ready to order.  They definitely tried to up-sell me with offers of spring rolls (which I accepted) and then more up-selling with offering drinks.  We got two take out dishes -- the spicy noodle bowl and the Pad Thai. The food was super hot, in terms of temperature and took a long time to cool down.  The spicy noodle bowl was OK, but the Pad Thai was uninspiring. It filled a hole in the belly, but that's about it.  I agree that this place is over priced. Still undecided about whether I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and incredibly fresh. The Dan Dan noodles were legitimately spicy instead of just a politically-correct chili pepper warning. The prices are fair and the space is very clean and modern. The owner was very patient and helpful assisting us with our ordering. Want to go back already and try the Kung Pao!"}
{"text":"Sweet and sour chicken was horrible. We will never come back here again. Not authentic Asian food at all. Very disappointed. Not worth my $$ at all!!"}
{"text":"Bad Curry Tried this place for first and last time today.  I do red curry and panang at home. Order paste from Thialand, add coconut milk, add fish sauce and palm sugar.  You got curry.  Dont know what they served me for the chicken curry, or my wife for malaysian peanut curry, but tasted sour and like it has a vinegar  base.  Each of us took two bites and threw it in the trash.  Samasosas and chicken ginzo small bites tasted like grocery store frozen.  I had great hope for this place, but dont waste your time."}
{"text":"Tried Wok Box a few months ago. They were very slow (about 15-20 minutes) to get our food out after we ordered and there was only one other couple in the place who already had their food. The food was okay, nothing special. Fairly bland and oily as others have said. Tried them again a couple weeks ago hoping for a better experience. Took about 20 minutes again and when the food came out it was wrong. Didn't have time to wait while they attempted to fix it, so just ate it. Again, bland but okay for on the run. Part of the way through our meal we realized they forgot the spring rolls we ordered, when I asked about them the guy said \"oh, that's where those should have gone, I couldn't figure it out\" and gave me the spring rolls that were sitting there for the extra 10 minutes and cold. Just tried them (sort of) for the third time. When I walked in there were two couples and two families both with one child. All but one of the families had their food. There was a couple ready to order when I walked in, but no cashier. They had apparently been there for a few minutes based on the husbands comments. The cook was able to see us and even looked back at us a few time that I saw and didn't say anything. Finally the couple in front of me left saying they'd waited well over 5 minutes. Within 30 seconds of them leaving someone emerged from the back (Murphy's law), walked right past me without saying a word and started helping get the meals ready that the cook was still preparing. at this time another couple with two children were in line behind me and even though both men working saw them walk in and walk by them they've still said nothing to any of us. Finally, after I'd waited well over 5 minutes I said \"excuse me, is there anyone taking orders?\" And the cooks response was \"there's only two of us working right now you'll just have to be patient!\"  I let them know that next time it would be nice if one of them to at least acknowledge folks were standing there with a \"we'll be right with you\" they said \"we didn't even know you were standing there\". I reminded them the couple in front of me walked out and they laughed about it. At this point, fearing for retaliation on my food I left. So did the family behind me. Good luck to anyone who tries this place. In my opinion...three strikes, you're out!!!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst Asian food in Calgary. Nothing is authentic and it is just bad Chain Asian."}
{"text":"1st time. Had chicken teriyaki and husband had Mongolian beef. Food was fresh and good. Defiantly will be back."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. Very poor food, made by people who obviously have never eaten asian food.  An employee could not speak english and did not understand what Duck Sauce was.  Um Hellllooo? I had the egg rolls and Chicken pad thai.  Both were horrible."}
{"text":"I've had the phó and the banh mí, which no one probably orders since it's not a very well-known dish. (What it is: a vietnamese sandwich with French bread, chicken, carrots, jicama, cucumber, cilantro, more vegetables, optional jalapeño peppers, and chicken with sauce - delicious!) I'm rather impressed with both of them, especially for this place being a fast-food restaurant. They were both really good, and my family makes banh mí homemade, so I can tell you I'm not a novice when it comes to this vietnamese sandwich!  My father ordered the lemongrass chicken, and I tried it - the spice was not the lame, bland type you usually receive from fast-food. It had considerable heat to it, which I liked. A lot of good flavor!  Definitely would recommend this place for any casual lunch or dinner. Very reasonable prices for great tasting food!"}
{"text":"The food is very good. My kids loved the noodles. We also tried yellow curry and butter chicken. Very yummy . I am glad to see some non franchise cuisine in the area."}

{"text":"The food is always hot, fresh and delicious - no doubt about it! The staff are also friendly and very efficient. Sometimes it can get pretty busy around the lunch hour (12:00-12:30) and they still manage to make the food so efficiently. All in all the food is delicious, it can be a little pricey BUT still worth it for the quality of the food you get."}
{"text":"Terrible food. I got the Thai red hot. Absolutely no flavor and the rice was mushy and the vegetables soggy!"}

{"text":"Wow I read a lot of reviews about this place and how  things are too salty or not enough salt and  not good enough compared to the luxurious Pei Wei.  Wow . It's Fast food and it was good. Pad Thai had unique recipe. It was a nice change from Pei Wei!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this new place a try located across the street from Target. I've driven by before and it looked new and hip. I must say I'd rather go to Panda Express than eat here and I don't go to Panda Express anymore. The food is cooked by amateurs. I ordered the Dan Dan noodles that come extra spicy. All the spice really is, is Sambal sauce. Like scoops of it. If I wanted noodles with Sambal sauce I could have made my own at home and it would have tasted 10 times better."}
{"text":"My son and I ate at the Wok Box today for the first and last time.  When we ordered, there was no one else in line, no one else waiting for their food, and very few people eating lunch.  I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken bowl with brown rice and my son ordered the Kung Pao Beef bowl with brown rice.  After waiting for several minutes, our order was ready.  We were served Kung Pao Chicken and Kung Pao Beef with noodles instead of brown rice.  Upon questioning the cashier, she did not say a word to me but went in the back and got the cook to make new bowls per our order.  There was no explanation or apology.  The cook quickly rectified the order and I was called when it was ready again.  Upon tasting my bowl, it tasted and looked much more like teriyaki chicken than Kung Pao.  I questioned the cashier and she said, \"Nope, it's Kung Pao\".  Each bowl contained an overwhelming amount of sauce.  What little brown rice there was, was hardly noticeable because it was swimming in the sauce.  The brown rice was not the authentic sticky Asian rice.  Instead, the rice looked more like it was a brownish type version of Minute Rice.  The meat, in contrast to the sauce, was MIA.  I had a total of three small pieces of chicken in my bowl and my son had one long strip of beef in his.  The bowl was mostly full of chunky pieces of cabbage and large amounts of sprouts.  As for customer service, the attitude of the cashier was less than desirable.  She was visibly not happy that I brought back my order, even though it was their mistake, and that I questioned if it was actually Kung Pao since it looked and tasted very much like teriyaki.  When we left, there was no, come again or good bye.  Instead, there was silence.  The restaurant was not busy and it was obvious we were leaving.  I can look past mistakes on an order, but what I think is inexcusable, is the poor customer service with the  bad attitude we received.  I left feeling like it was my fault the order was made wrong.  I will not be going back there again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They can custom make whatever you want! They were very understanding of my complex order. The staff is extremely friendly. I would come back here for the food and staff :)"}
{"text":"Full credit because they make specific provision for the wheat-sensitive, vegan, and vegetarian clientele. It's a real challenge to find tasty Asian offerings for a vegan celiac, but we found a couple of pretty tasty alternatives. They use a separate wok, non-wheat soy sauce, and rice noodles for those particular needs. Yay!"}
{"text":"I tried Wok Box about seven years ago when they first opened in Creekside. And I thought it was over-priced and flavourless. After seven years, my wife and I decided to try it again. My wife had the ginger beef with chow-mein noodles, and I had the crispy chicken with chow-mein noodles as well. There was barely any flavour in our dishes (the chicken had no taste and wasn't even crispy), and no sauce to coat the noodles. If I'm going to eat carbs, they better taste good. I wouldn't recommend this company, and will not be coming back. I really don't understand how this company is still in business."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by the staff, super friendly. The food came in fresh and was served hot. Quantities are generous too. We ate thai red curry with rice ! Tasted great! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time. Got home and realized my order was wrong. No sauce and they added rice when I specifically said I only wanted veggies. Turned around and went back. All I got was a \"sorry\" from the manager. No reimbursement...or anything...nothing. Who wants to drive back to a restaurant after getting the wrong order and then just a sorry? Unacceptable. Especially for a brand new restaurant trying to gain clientele. Even more unbelievable, my order was wrong again the second time. The food is not good and is overpriced. Go to Pei Wei. Better food and overall experience for the same money. Horrible customer service. I would not give this place a try. Not worth it."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the wait was ridiculous and the staff was a mixture of indifferent and confused. One employee was eating and drinking right over the prep area, another employee never cleaned a single table except to grab an unopened juice box off of a dirty table to stick back in the fridge for purchase. I would say the crew is untrained and either don't care about health and safety regulations and/or don't care. The owners need to get a manager and staff in there that know what they are doing and do it right."}
{"text":"I've been getting take-out regularly during the day but decided to stop in on my way home the other night. When I entered, one of the two employees present was taking out the trash, he stopped what he was doing and followed me to the counter to take my order and payment. He then proceeded to prepare my take-out order without washing his hands. He not only handled my food but contaminated the food in the containers by just reaching in. Needless to say I was totally disgusted and threw the food away as soon as I got home. I didn't say anything while still there because I was the only customer at the time. I called today to speak with the manager, he apologized but then made some comments which led me to think he didn't believe me. I will never step foot back in this place!"}
{"text":"Easily the worst stir fry I have had in my life. Was brought the wrong bowl twice before I decided to eat the bland, uninspired mess. Noodles were not the noodles I ordered and this was after having my food remade to be the proper dish I ordered. Overpriced and bland, look elsewhere for your generic food."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like it. Tried it twice. Not good. Don't bother. Great location is the only good I can say."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! Fresh food, great prices, and excellent customer service. I have used this place as a caterer as well and they can't be beat. Their deliveries are always on time, they have excellent set ups, and again their prices are phenomenal. Crowd favorites are chicken salad, Thai noodle salad, and orange chicken also the most amazing green beans!"}
{"text":"Went on Sunday for lunch. Stir fry's tasted fresh, which i take any day over tasty/savory food. Accomodated nut allergy very well - no accudent with a lot of dishes in the menu contain peanuts. For the price, can't complain, good alternative to Panda Express."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here,  the employees are friendly and the service given is great."}
{"text":"Love the food here. The spring rolls are to die for! The staff is super sweet and will go an extra mile to work in your requirements."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my family after seeing it a few days previously when driving through the mall. I was very excited to try a new Asian restaurant, and even more excited after reading the menu.  However, after placing our order, we waited approximately 45 minutes before our meals were served. The meal itself was so-so and the restaurant seemed to be exceedingly poorly run and managed.  When we came in there were probably 15 groups waiting for their meals and only one teenager preparing food. About 20 minutes later suddenly there were five people preparing food, but at that point the entire restaurant was full of people waiting for food, and no one was eating anything. They actually had to close the restaurant and not allow anyone else in, because they couldn't handle the orders they already had. Apparently they also ran out of white rice. How in the hell does an Asian restaurant with half of its menu being based on rice, run out of white rice?  Long story short, I wish this restaurant we're good, I really do. Maybe with better management and someone other than teenagers working here, it could be"}

{"text":"My wife and I used to eat here quite often, almost every weekend, but we got turned away one night and won't be coming back.   We took my parents and sister to eat here one night and they didn't want to serve us eat in as they were closing in 30 minutes. The staff said they could only give us take out due to the time constraint for cooking 5 dishes and us having to finish eating by close; but I've noticed that when you order take out it is a much smaller portion than eat in. Do you close at 10 or 9:30? I guess they only want business when it's convenient for them. They had plenty of staff but most were either cleaning or in the back. It was obvious that they were more concerned with getting out the door right at 10 than serving customers until close. So, we went next door and ate at chipotle which is probably where a lot of their business ends up and had a great time. They weren't in a rush to shoo people away either.  If you are looking for pho - vietnamese soup go somewhere else. I've had a lot throughout the valley and that is well below par. Maybe an american version? I don't know but stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Four letter word: YUCK! - Zero Stars   To Wok Box: Don't advertise that your food is healthy. The noodles were greasy, the brown rice was not properly cooked and tasted very bad.  Customer Service was just as bad as the food. Warning: If you have a to go order, make sure you get the right one! The staff handed our order to another customer only to get it back from him in his car. The employee attempted to give it to us and was disappointed that we did not take that food out of that persons car. We are contacting Corporate."}
{"text":"This place was terrible! I waited for 15 minutes to get my small kung pao chicken take out order. People who ordered after me received theirs first. When I finally received my order, as I was near my car, the guy preparing the orders ran out to tell me he came me the wrong order. As I returned to work to eat, all of the sauce was dripping out of the bottom of the box.  Everything in the bag was soaking wet from the sauce.   On top of this, the food had no taste to it at all. It was all noodles and barely any meat. If you want good Asian food for lunch in the San Tan Mall area, I recommend Chen's."}
{"text":"I've been here two times. The first time, I got there about 30 minutes before they closed and was immediately reminded by the people working that they were closing in 30 minutes. I went there again last night an hour before they closed and was told that since they had been slow, they had already started to close and there was a limited menu and no rice...I'm not that old but when I was young you didn't start to close until the time on the door, and you most certainly don't ever turn a paying customer away. The food is not that great so I'd recommend if you're having a craving for this kind of food, go down the street to Teriyaki Madness."}
{"text":"Asked for Teriyaki Chicken w/Lo Mein noodles, got regular chicken with angel hair noodles. No Crab Rangoons. Over priced, sub-par food. Would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Ultra fast Asian stir fry! Great choice for a speedy lunch. I like how they have lists of vegan, vegetarian and GF options posted near the menu. I found the food too saucy, but I was happy to get stir fried veggies with tofu in only a few minutes."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out tonight for dinner. We called in an order and it was ready in 10 mins which is awesome when you have 2 starving boys at home. I was treated with very friendly staff and I was happy to see its casual dining. I got the sweet Mongolian beef noodle bowl, super yummy. There was lots of beef and the noodles were delicious. My kids ate crispy chicken teriyaki rice bowls. They loved them and ate almost the entire adult meal. I will be returning and I plan on trying everything on the menu. Don't forget they deliver no extra charge!!!!"}
{"text":"This place must be under new management or something, we have been here a few times and it's always been pretty good! Today we came in and not only was the food mediocre at best but, the customer service was horrible.   No greeting when we entered, then as we got ready to order they told us for an extra sauce it would be an additional $1... Once the sauce came it was about a tablespoon possibly less... For $2, I could have bought a BOTTLE of plum sauce!  Then they yelled at our kids because they were STANDING by the fire alarm, they were not touching it at all just standing there, you don't yell at my kids especially if I'm standing right there watching them, they were fine!   So, we ordered the Indian Butter Chicken, it was NOT at all the same as before, it was bland with very little sauce!   I ordered the Singapore cashew chicken, it was pretty good (the only reason for the 1 star).  We also ordered a kids Chicken which came with about 1/4 of the rice as normal and the chicken was super dry!  We had a stamp card that they stamped once, when asked why the one stamp and not three the \"cook\" came and said \"actually you shouldn't have received any\", apparently you have to order the regular size and not the lunch, which is fine but speak kindly and explain that, no need to be rude!   Had we not had two hungry kids we would have went elsewhere.  Won't be coming here again!"}
{"text":"I should have read the other reviews before I ate here! This placed isn't gonna last too long. I had the Butter Chicken Naan-Wich and the chicken was weirdly hard like it's been sitting for awhile. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Sorry! Fortune cookies are good though!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch during Christmas shopping with the family. Sister had the Pad Thai, mom had the Lo Mein and I had the Sweet Mongolian with steak. We all enjoyed our meals, and the spring rolls as well. Although my sister did complain that the Pad Thai did not really taste like Pad Thai. I really appreciated that all of the meals were made to order. It allowed a fair bit of customizability. It was a bit pricier than I expected, but much better than places like Panda in terms of quality."}
{"text":"The food was okay, rather bland though I will admit that I prefer highly spiced dishes. The staff was friendly so the restaurant merits an Average rating.   I had the chicken KOREAN FIRECRACKER noodle dish which is supposed to be spicy  (it was recommended by the young man who took my order); it however was not spicy at all. The ingredients are fresh and there are plenty of options. My takeout order came-up quickly and I was on my way.   I may give it another try eventually but for now, I'll stick with P** W** for Asian fast food"}
{"text":"I usually give nice reviews, but .... I found the place by accident and liked the menu. Store is clean and a cool kind of edgy feel. Nice. I ordered the Kung Pao noodles w/chicken. Sadly, there was no spicy sauce and no hot chiles. A small serving of chicken and a small portion of veggies, mostly just noodles. For $8.99. I will pass."}
{"text":"Food was good, cashier wasn't that nice though. The beef in the pho was a bit undercooked but overall food was tasty and service was fast"}
{"text":"First time eating here today, I ordered a Dan Dan bowl to go.  I get home starving and ready to eat.  As I dig in to take my first bite I noticed my noodles were not thoroughly cooked.  As I go in for my 2nd bite I see a long strand of hair blended in with my noodles. Barf! So gross,  my stomach is turning.    This was very disappointing after having a long day and wanting to go home,  eat and rest. What a waste of money and food :("}
{"text":"Had a groupon and we ordered 4 items. I will never go to this place again. Ordered the sweet Mongolian. Pad Thai,lemongrass chicken and the Mongolian beef and broccoli. The only dish that had any flavor was the sweet Mongolian. Everything else was just bland and I had to put some siriacha Thai sauce to give it some kick and flavor. Thank god I had the groupon because at 9 bucks a large order it isn't worth it.  J&k Chinese up the street is so much better and has so much flavor. Hope they can figure it out because it's such a great location that I'm sure could be successful. Service was great and order was correct and plentiful just lacking taste."}
{"text":"I don't find the ingredients very fresh- hidden behind thick sauces. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"This is my third time here in the span of several years. I figured I'd give it one more go. Unfortunately, I experienced the same disappointment this time around. I find the flavours to be rather bland for my taste. I had the Kung Pao this time and while the noodles were good, the sauce falls flat. I think this will be the last time I go here. I'd rather spend a little more and eat at Noodle Box."}
{"text":"I really love the concept of this place considering you can get a lot for a decent price. It is always hot and nice fresh ingredients being able to pick what you want is always nice. It's a nice clean place to eat , would recommend it for a nice lunch or even a date night better then fast food and staff are nice. It isn't ever that busy so it's quick service."}
{"text":"I've had take out from here a couple of times as well as eaten on their patio. Their pad thai and lemon chicken are quite good. Their ginger beef is okay (Ming's is better). I had their lemongrass curry chicken tonight and it was also okay. I did like the fresh veggies, but the curry wasn't overly tasty, just hot. They do serve beer, which is a plus. It is just around the corner from where I live so convenience is definitely a factor for me. They are quite pricey, but it is a much healthier option than most fast food places. I do love the little boxes the shareables come in - they make me feel like I'm on a sitcom."}
{"text":"It was... OK. I would give it 1 star had it not been for the excellent customer service and nice atmosphere. Food was so so. Not authentic asian. I was happy with the large portion of noodles, but the veggies and tofu was lacking, same with the sauce. It seemed there was no sauce. And it was supposedly a spicy option. :(  So over all, judging the food, I was disappointed. Also I ordered spring rolls to go with my order, and for $15 bucks, I get plain noodles and super basic spring rolls that were over priced. I'd rather just go to a real Thai/Vietnamese place. Sorry. I'm over the Caucasian catered Asian restaurants in this area. I want some real Asian food, with more veggie options as I'm used to getting in Los Angeles and Hawaii."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch day before yesterday. From the girl yelling \"Welcome to Wok Box!\" At the top of her lungs to the food that had a little more than I \"bargained\" for in it, this was a really rough experience. I ordered sweet Mongolian beef \"sumo\" sized. I went to fill up my drink cup and the ice trough was filled, and overflowing with water. The water was all over the counter and the dining room was a wreck and looked as though it hadn't  been bussed in more than a few hours. I won't get too detailed about what  was in my food but let's just say it was cooked and well sauced and shouldn't have been. I normally would have just brought this to someone's attention but judging from the condition of the restaurant, It didn't appear there was a manager there. I know stuff like this can happen but from the other reviews here it seems like a reoccurring issue. I"}
{"text":"Portions were very small. The food I got (butter chicken) wasn't bad, but a little too salty. But $7 for the tiniest portion ever. A restaurant can make up for price by adding value (friendly service, great ambience), but Wok Box fails on those fronts as well. Next time I'm at that mall and hungry, I'll walk next door to Chipotle and get a better value for my $7."}
{"text":"The portions are tiny and the food is terrible. I would give it zero stars if I could. They take forever to make it as well. Far and away the worst Chinese food I've. Ever eaten. Had I not gotten it to-go, I would have immediately asked for my money back."}
{"text":"Firsr time back here in canada to eat at the wok box. Discovered this francise a few years ago before i started yelpping. This place is awesome. Being from california its definely a big change. The food was hot and hot. I ordered the dan dan and it is spicy hot and cooked hot.  All ingredients are portioned correctly to make for a great mix of food items.  I should have ordered or requesred extra bean sprouts even they charge extra. My partner got the pad thai and it was also good and hot. Wish there was a wok box in my area but they are only found in canada."}
{"text":"Wok Box is one of those places that you always hear your friends talking about and you always say that you are going to try....someday.  Well tpday was that day.  Actually, we tried to go to Una Pizza for lunch, which is just down the street, but they don't have a lunch menu and I HATE paying supper prices when all I want is a light meal. Just personal preference.  The Wok Box is a perfect place for a lunch.  The lunch box is a good sized mean and it is priced at $6.49.  I kinda thought it should have been a little cheaper, may even a $1 off.  But again that is just me being economical.  My friend got the Regular sized ($10.99) Signapore cashew and polished it off.  I was grumbling a little bit about the prices and she reminded me that the food was healthy, fresh and was a relatively good sized portion, so it was worth the price.  I humbly agree.  We went a little after the lunch rush so it wasn't too busy, the service was really good.  I like when instead of being super chatty, they get you what you want, have a smile on their face and are nice about it.  The Wok Box definitely succeeds in that department.  When I started this review, I had given the Wok Box three stars, but in retrospect, this place is definitely worth spending a little extra money."}
{"text":"Bottom line, Flo's has way better food for a comparable price. We ordered to go so maybe it would be better if we dined there? Either way, to go should be prepared to match the quality of dining there.  The food is decent but I didn't think it was good enough to justify the cost.  It was expensive for meh...."}
{"text":"Recently I ordered catering from them. Everything tasted so delicious. I specially loved the bang bang shrimp and the Dan Dan. Plus they had these naanwiches which are big portions for just $5 each and tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Okay, let's try this again (Yelp ate my first try at review).  I've tried Wok In the Box 2 or 3 times and I've tried to like it.  It's very close to my house so I would love to like it.  Alas, I don't.  The food is \"meh\" at best.  The highlight of our meal was my sons teryaki chicken with noodles off the kids menu.  It was much tastier than the Mongolian Beef & Brocolli and Orange Chicken that the adults had.  We might go back just for that as he LOVED it (and I found myself sneaking bites of his instead of eating my own food)."}
{"text":"First off, walking into the cloud of smoke should have been a give away to not eat there. Was really hard to breathe and see in there. One of the workers had to prop the door open, for the entirety of our meal because it was so smoky. I ordered the chicken fried rice and the guy who was taking my order kept asking me what noodles I wanted. Literally asked me like 3 xs. I had to reorder my food several times because he couldn't get it right and had to call the manager or lady who was cooking back there to come do it for him. When I got my fried rice it was oily and nasty. There were legit like 5 tbsps of oil at the bottom of my bowl. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I had the BLACK BEAN:(Stirfry) It's served with a sweet chinese sauce and vegetables. You can also order it with rice or noodles. I ordered it with rice.  Yes the food is hot and fresh, but the rice was a little mushy meaning they put too much water in the mixture. Also the beef and veggies were on the SALTY side. At first when I initially tried Wok Box I thought the concept was neat. Fast food chinese prepared hot and eat-in or take-away. I gave this establishment two kicks at the can to get it right. I guess it just doesn't have the flavors I'm looking for. I think for the money foodcourt chinese may be the better choice here."}
{"text":"Poor management, slow service and horrible attitudes.  I used to come here 2 - 3 times a week but since the management changed a few months ago today will be the last time.  The ironic part is while the lady was on the phone making my food she said someone was complaining about her poor attitude."}
{"text":"First and last visit to this so called food establishment. We should have selected Panda Express. This Asian food was reprehensible in lack of taste, product quality, menu selection, let alone poor customer service. Trust me, save your money and eat @ Panda or Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"Nope.. All this money invested in decor and good location .. food sucks bunch of spices mixed not in the right proportion. Wish the company had worked on the recipes.  Here is the proof just knowing the ingredients will not give u good tasting food."}
{"text":"There aren't too many of these places around, but we love coming here for lunch. My company often gets food to-go from here, and the owners are so nice! They always help out their staff, cook when they are asked, and are often the cashiers. You can tell that this is someone's livelihood, as they take great pride in how the place is kept and the customer service that is given.   I always get the Sweet Mongolian because I loooove garlic, and their spring rolls are soo good! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Fast-food Asian fusion. A pretty unique menu. Mediocre food, but quick and helpful service. They even serve your dish at the table if you're eating in (as opposed to calling out your name or the order and expecting you go fetch).  Since this was my first time, I didn't realize that the napkins and plasticware were set up in a central location, so I didn't grab them. Rather than pointing me in the direction of the items and watching me get up to retrieve them for myself, my server told me not to worry about it, then went to get everything I needed for me. Such a small thing, but not the kind of service you necessarily expect from a fast-food restaurant.  I've definitely had better curry in my life, but I wasn't expecting anything to knock my socks off anyway. The menu is diverse enough and the service was pleasant enough that I'll be back.  Good work, Wok Box.  :)"}
{"text":"I came here with a coupon and have been wanting to try it. I would say it is pretty average fair for fast food Asian cuisine. I ordered the pad Thai noodle bowl. Spice level was good...the menu indicates that it is spicy...but I wouldn't call it \"hot.\"  I'm glad that I sumo'd the meat otherwise their wouldn't have been any meat in there. The workers were super friendly."}
{"text":"Zero customer service. I have not been to this place but I try to make an order over the phone TWICE (different days) and when I ask a question about the menu the employees says he can't give me that info over the phone that it's too hard for him to explain.  I guess they don't want my money."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice in the last few months with last night being the 2nd time.  Each time I have been pleased that the establishment was clean, quiet, and not too crowded.  Last night I ordered the mongollian beef and broccoli. The beef was super tasty with a great smokey flavor and the broccoli was crisp! Only complaint, way too much sauce.  Had ordered brown rice and by the time I got down to the rice it looked like soup with rice in it.  It did take a bit longer to get the order once it was ordered and the guy calling  out the numbers had to have been whispering because I couldn't hear a thing he said lol.  All that said however, I will definitely be back and next time I'm going for the Dan Dan :)"}
{"text":"Normally, I love this place. I tried to eat here tonight and left extremely disappointed. I waited at the front counter for 5 minutes for someone to take my order. A worker told me, \"it's going to be much longer.\" I asked \"how much longer?\" And he replied \"very. We are backed up on orders and he is new.\" So I replied, with disappointment, \"so I should go somewhere else?!\" He replied \"yes!\". So, I left without my dinner and went to Chipotle. I guess I will go to Chipotle next time."}
{"text":"Just logged into my Yelp after not logging in for a while and found a very rude message from the owner who basically told me that my review was a complete lie. The message was completely inappropriate and once again demonstrates the poor customer service of this place. She stated in the message that because I tried to ask the \"teenager\" and the cashier that that's the reason my questions weren't answered and that I should have asked \"an adult.\" I think it is clear by the reviews that I am not the only person who has had issues with the menu, a lack of customer service, and bland food. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone, particularly after receiving the message from the owner, with whom I didn't even interact during my visit."}
{"text":"Meh! I have had better! On every front.   Came in at lunch with a friend since we were in the area and thought we would try it out for a quick lunch.  A fair amount on the menu, so I thought it was promising. Great prices too. The man who took our order was very abrupt. Not sure why but he seemed bothered as soon as he took our order. Not a great start.  We ordered Kung pow, samosas to share and Jungle lemon grass. Our order came out fairly quick, under 10 minutes which was impressive. We thought things were turning around. Nope.   The beef in the Kung pow was very chewy and the few pieces that were actually in the noodles, weren't that great. There was no real flavor in this Kung pow. Very disappointing.   The samosas that we shared were 4 of them and we ended up only eatting one each. They were bland and the saving grace was the dipping sauce.   My friend had the jungle lemon grass and she mentioned it didn't taste that good and the veggies were over cooked. Not sure how, since our order was quick?  Didnt see our server since we ordered since someone else brought our food. Went to the counter and asked if we could have our bill.  Paid and left. We were there for under 30 minutes and the food was poor and the service was non-existent. Will not be back."}
{"text":"This place was suprisingly good amongst the Americanized Asian fusion places I've been to. Ordered 3 or 4 of the noodle dishes, all were solid. The kimchee rice balls were solid as an appetizer. The Vietnamese iced coffee, while great to drink, is really too sweet for me to consider authentic but I'll drink it anyways!  Various Asian elements are here, but I've seen more Vietnamese than at other locations. Noodle dishes were fine, haven't tried the pho, and I would not suggest banh mi if you wanted something close to the real deal. Then again, you wouldn't be here if you wanted the real deal =D  For an easy lunch that's different from the everyday sandwich or hamburger, Wok Box has my endorsement."}
{"text":"I called ahead for my order, so that was conveinient. The spring rolls were okay, sadly though they were the best part of the meal. When I got back to my office with my lunch, they had put so much sauce in the box that it leaked through and I didn't notice until I set the bag of food on my desk. I would highly recommend asking them to double box your order.   The food was really hot (temperature), which was good, but it was too hot to eat so I had to wait a bit to let it cool.   It tasted like a whole bunch of salt and squishy bread dough (I ordered noodles).   It wasn't an altogether terrible rage inducing experience. The staff was nice, the restaurant clean, but if you are wanting asian food. Go somewhere that's worth it."}
{"text":"i was walking along 17th, looking for something cheap and quick on my way to a concert, and stopped in at the wok box. it took them a couple of minutes to notice i was there - in this case not a problem as i was mulling over the menu. when the guy came to the counter i asked what he recommended. he was aghast - like he'd never heard of anyone asking that in a restaurant before. after some stammering and smiling, the indian gentleman, without a hint of irony, suggested the butter chicken (the only indian stirfry they make). i settled on the pad thai and it was such disgusting slime that i did something i've never done with a meal before - i threw it out after a few bites. i should have seen the red flag when he asked if i wanted the pad thai \"with rice or noodles.\"  it was spicy, but there were almost no noodles, and the vegetables were just generic stirfry veg that i'm sure are exactly the same in every wok dish they prepare. despite only having had a few bites and even after i washed the putridness down with a london fog and pastry, the MSG-ish, gross taste remained in my mouth for the rest of the evening. so if you're heading down to 17th, please for the love of gossip girl go to manie's, or tubby's, or one of the many awesome establishments available."}
{"text":"Love the pad Thai and the red curry is quite good too. Try them with chicken you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Don't go here... The owner at this location is so damn cheap. I went to the Quarry Park location and they gave me a wonderful ice coffee. I even asked for less ice (so I'm not done in like 3 sips) and they gave me a full cup. The cheap bastards here at 130th however, filled the whole cup with ice to the top and there was barely any coffee in there at all.   I thought I would try them again and ask for less ice this time and the guy argued with me and said they can't do it. I mentioned that the other wok box gave me one without any trouble and he said it's different here.  Any ways I get the cup and it's 3/4 full... Cheap asses... What's a few ounces of coffee gonna put you out of business? Give me a break."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and food was excellent.  We had the lemongrass rice box and the seshuan pepper noodle box.  We were a little hesitant after reading the previous reviews but decided to still give them a try.  We are glad we did and will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Food was just OK. Lady at the front seemed nice but needs some training on the menu and the food that is served there. She really didn't know what she was talking about. Unfortunate because this would have been a great location for lunch on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This place is like the, \"McDonald's\" of quick wok fare. If you want some OK stir fry quick - this is a decent place. The price is about the same as McDonald's and it tastes OK. I would recommend this place. It's not fine dining - but they are friendly each time I visit."}
{"text":"I had the sweet Mongolian beef on udon noodles. I paid for extra meat, and there was a ton. It was pretty good, and the food came out quickly. So, if you're on lunch you should be good. I will be back to try some other other items."}
{"text":"Service and food are both awesome! They even remember me when I come in...and I don't go that often  last time they called me by name. Such friendly staff and tasty food. While I can't get Chinese food like I'm used to back east, this will be my go to place while I'm living here in Calgary."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. Not a lot of flavor and while it comes out hot.. Doesn't seem fresh. With other options in the area, I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed on my order of butter chicken. The portion was very small and different from the picture. The restaurant wasn't maintained for cleanliness even though it was empty. Dirty dishes were stacked sky high, tables weren't clean. The flavor of the sauce was good. But it didn't seem good value for what you pay for a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Think of this as a more upscale version of panda express with a diverse variety of asian cuisine.  Went there on a groupon and had a great time.  The restaurant is very clean and the service was excellent.  Our food was delicious and the portions were large enough for left overs.  Try the kimchi rice balls as an appetizer!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. The food is honestly worse than the stuff you get at any food court. I ordered the beef & broccoli and the Kung Pao. The broccoli looked as if it was a week old, yellowish not bright green. The beef was chewy. The Kung Pao was mostly noodles, hardly any chicken. So not worth the money."}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend and my roommate went with me to this location. My dad used to own a Japanese restaurant, so I know what's good and what needs improvement. Well, there's a few things wrong with this place.  The staff looked as though they were pissed off. No \"hello\" or \"welcome\" and no smiles from any of the girls working there. The cashier didn't say a word until we started to order.  Being that it was my roommates first time there, she didn't understand that you got to choose your own meat for whatever dish you'd like. What she said to the cashier was \"I'd like the teriyaki\" the cashier asked \"what kind\" three times until she finally told her she's supposed to choose her meat. What kind of idiot doesn't say that in the first place? Not to mention her being extremely unfriendly about it.  With my father owning a Japanese restaurant, I know exactly what teriyaki sauce is supposed to taste like. All three of us ordered some and it was completely flavorless! We had to pour soy sauce all over it to taste anything and even then it didn't help. I also had a side of plum sauce that helped a little bit, but why put plum sauce on the side when there's no sauce to begin with?  The spring rolls are too small, they taste decent, but nothing special.   The price was $25 for flavorless food and bad attitudes? I'd rather go to Panda Express and spend the same about for some flavor and happy workers, even if the food is worse for me.  Anyways, the first time going there was quite enjoyable compared to this last time, but I will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"Went there a few weeks ago and what an improvement from what it was many months ago. Place looked clean, staff is super friendly. Most improvement was on food. We ordered Indian butter chicken, it had good and rich flavor. We also ordered a beef dish (can't remember the dish name). To my husband, it was a bit on the sweet side but I really like it.  Personal preference, I guess. I'd definitely come back and try more dishes.  Also their coffee is big thumb up!!"}
{"text":"I come here with a colleague for lunch at least twice a week. The service is great and speedy and the food is so delicious! I always switch between the Singapore cashew and the kung Po ...you must try this place. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered the singapore cashew with beef the first time and they messed up and put chicken, whatever, it was ok. Not awesome, but not unedible. The second time I ordered butter chicken, I found it to be a little dry, but my friend had ordered the same thing and hers wasnt as bad... It was yet again ok, but not great... Then I ordered the kung pao chicken... It tasted EXACTLY the same as the singapore cashew... If they are only using one type of sauce they should call them all by the same name!"}
{"text":"We love Wok Box! We eat here at least twice a week. It's close to our office and the food is always fresh, served hot and tastes great! I've tried several of the meals and I've liked all of them enough to order each again. We highly recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"Husband loved the Spicy Thai Tamarind and I had the Beef Pho, which was terrific. Staff was nice and stopped by to see how everything was. They guarantee food will be out within seven minutes which is great for when we bring the kids."}
{"text":"This is our second trip here, and now officially our last.  Both experiences: wow this is horrible service. Wow the portions are really small for the price. Wow this is taking forever.   The food is not that great either. Don't bother- go up the street to Chens or even Great Wall."}
{"text":"I like the idea of this place ... a walk-up cafe with mix-and-match options, made to order. Nice.  But, you know, the food actually has to taste good if I'm ever to come back.  And, sorry, I won't.  I had the Budha Bowl.  Yes, they inexplicably do not spell Buddha correctly -- what, are they actually trying to brand the word \"Budha\"?  A bowl of noodles with an obnoxious amount of onions and peppers and few other veggies.  Bathed in a boring \"hosin-ginger sauce\".  I put the sauce name in quotes because I didn't taste ginger, or any other distinguishing flavor, for that matter ... I'm guessing it is not made on site. A quite-small smattering of mung bean sprouts and a lime on top.  Yawn."}
{"text":"This is pretty good fast food Asian. Compared to another popular Asian fast food this is far superior     The service is excellent and fast. The restaurant is very clean.   I thought the serving sizes were fine. The choice of a small bowl or a regular bowl is offered   Other reviewers thought the servings were small, I respectively disagree.   We ordered a small pad Thai.  Thought there could be more chicken and a few less veggie pieces.   The regular chicken Singapore cashew was a little more hot than I anticipated   The noodles were really good. Although I would suggest a little more chicken"}
{"text":"We had a long appointment at our new home being built in the N/W and we were starving so I thought we would give Wok Box another try. I tried it in Ontario 2 summers ago and was sooo less than impressed so we have avoided it. It was a new business though at the time and I thought we could try it again this evening as I really WANT to like it. I will be living around the corner from there soon and I find the advertised fare to be a lot healthier than your average pizza joint. So in we went. Limited seating, not very busy, clean, nice lighting. These were my initial observations. I really wanted red coconut curry with shrimp and ordered this without hesitation. My spouse asked staff what the most popular dish was on the menu and he went with their response; Singapore cashew chicken on thick noodles (hokkien noodles). The staff was.... well, rigid is how I would like to put it. Professional but not friendly - rigid. We were told to have a seat and the food did come out fairly quickly. My bowl had 2 big globs of steamed rice (slightly overcooked) and a brownish sauce and some smallish shrimp and veg semi covering the rice. Let me tell you, I have had better. I did not even taste coconut and it was not a creamy warm you up kind of meal with a deep curry taste. My husband liked his dish, he said he certainly \"wouldn't kill for it\" but even at that, his bowl was better than mine. His had thick noodles I normally would not like but the tangy sauce on them was quite OK. The chicken was well cooked in his also but overall he just was not crazy about the combo. We split an iced tea and the meal was $25. TOO much dough for this fast food version of Thai style food. I cannot say I will never be back but I am going to order more carefully next time."}
{"text":"My wife had been here with her friends previously and recommended that we go for our date night. The menu was full of dishes that I recognized from my travels across Asia. To bad I only had to pick one. The dishes have been Americanized but still have enough of the right flavors that I was impressed. The service was friendly and our meal was ready much quicker than I expected. Between the dishes it appears that much of the sauce that is used has similar base flavor which may get old if you come here often. But for my first time here and if you don't come too often, it was a good change. I may be back if I need a quick descent meal."}
{"text":"Very mediocre. It was disappointing how heavy the dishes were on the rice & noodles and how skimpy they were on the meat & veggies. My husband got the crispy chicken & he said it was mostly breading & hardly any chicken. I had veggies & tofu with noodles.  Well there were about 2 pieces of broccoli & lots of bean sprouts so that was the vegetable part.   The nicest thing i can say about the food is i have had worse things in my mouth! I will be going to yogis from now on."}
{"text":"Flavors are very strange.  Pei Wei, Panda, YC's are all better!!!  You can't order a fountain drink with a kids meal-only juice or milk."}
{"text":"Overall, the food is good quality. About as good as Pei Wei for a similar price. Much better than Panda Express. They make the food quickly, and its easy to pick up. I pretty much only go here for the food taste/speed.   Complaints:   1.) Their phone is down, and has been for weeks with no fix in the future. The workers there didn't seem to care, and told me to order online. That's fine, but you would think that they would at the very least put that on their website/remove the phone number from it, or put a sign up.  2.) I go pretty much weekly during lunch. Their touch screen soda machine NEVER has soda in it. I looked at their 'no calorie' options, and of the 12+ options, they just had water left! At 12:00 p.m. in the day! Seriously? You're a restaurant. You should restock immediately when things are getting low.  3.) Cleanliness is spotty. Tables often need wiping down, the empty food bowls sit by the trash and pile up, and some people have been using their utensil containers as trash! There was some stuff touching the eating-end of the forks where they have the drinks. Seriously? Clean up your restaurant!   4.) I went during a lunch break the employees had (2:00 p.m, sorry I just got off work!) and one stopped eating to help me. He prepared my food without washing his hands. Again - seriously? I don't know if you've been putting your fingers in your mouth or what!  I go there pretty often. Its good for a quick fast lunch, but be warned."}
{"text":"I threw away my last take out order of rice noodles and red curry. It was sooooooo spicy I couldn't even palate it. I didn't know anything could be that spicy! Some people must have iron tongues! Whoa! I sometimes contemplate going back and trying something else but then I get scared and chicken out."}
{"text":"My family is a big fan of PEI Wei, so decided to try wok box as an alternative for take out..... Not a good experience. Their \"large\" portion actually come in a small box and the dish is mixed with the rice, which means by the time you get home its mostly a soggy mess and there is no recognizable sauce left... I found the chicken and or steak to dry and tasteless (it looks like its pre-cooked and reheated).... I should have taken a hint when I walked in on a Friday at 7pm and I was the only customer.... Sad to say, but I will resume driving the extra mile to go to pei Wei."}
{"text":"You failed me for the last time Wok Box.  Tony, I'm calling you out brotha!   Listen to your customers, man. We're not happy.   Today on my lunch I ordered the Jungle Lemongrass and 3 piece Chicken Gyoza.   I appreciate that got the last order of  Gyoza and your manager Comp'd me 2 Spring Rolls because guy only had 2 Gyoza left. That's great, awesome customer service.   And here's the  \"But\".    But when I get back to my office, I open my lemongrass and find The top is covered with Rotting Cilantro.   I'm like: What the...? No way.   I pick through it, thinking yeah it's late in the day, herbs get cut in morning, there's probably only a little dark or a few black pieces.   ...newp.   The entire garnish is black. Some are even slimy.   See, I'm trying to rationalize this because the chef wasn't busy. It's 4:3o pm. On a Monday at San Tan Village. This place is a ghost town minus some blue bloods zombie'ing around. I was literally the only one in-what I'm gonna loosely call a \"Restaurant\" here.   So I've got to wonder, see this is the part I can't seem to puzzle through: the Chef played that. Each ingredient, added by hand, exacting the right amount of flavors from each. Each ingredients precariously balancing the other, raising each note above the next, simultaneously calling back--a fugue to the original chord ... and your chef thought that placing rotting Cilantro on top was the keystone holding this flavor profile together?   I can still picture him in the kitchen all like: \"this cilantro is gunna add the right amount of Swamp to this. I'm coming for you, Bobby Flay!\"   A month ago I had your Beef Pho. I'd rather drive to  Da Vang in Phoenix. They may have roaches but at least they've mastered the Ancient Art of Flavoring. Who knows, maybe the roaches are secret ingredient handed down from generation-to-generation by Thíck Quáng Da Vang the Elder. Whatever it is, you need to get some.   And today's mess: Jungle Lemongrass with a side of Chicken Gyoza & spring Rolls...I'm done man. I tried. The spring rolls were a oily bog. Chef shortcut couldn't take a second to rest them on a towel and soak some of that grease trap up?   They're are three things you can't do in this industry: shortcut talent, shortcut ingredients and shortcut your customers. Every time we eat at your establishment we are investing in your idea; your creative vision.   We are shareholders in your dream.   Not anymore.   Business 101 teaches us that within a the first 2 years, are the hardest for any restaurant and the time when 90% close their doors. You've been open a year. If you're still open in a year's time, I'll give you another try.   If you're not, then We'll both know why.   I'm not looking for hand-outs and I don't want your apology and a free lunch voucher. That's not what I'm about.   Listen to your reviews, bro. They're all the same. Repetitive. Over and over your customers are saying the same things. And I'm sure I know what you're thinking, but we can't ALL be wrong.   Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta make my way to the restroom. See, I made the mistake is eating some of your food."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by the friendly staff and a heavenly smell coming from the kitchen. The restaurant was very clean and bright. I ordered a a meal to go and did not have to wait long at all. I am gluten free  due to illness & was so happy to see all of the choices that I had! I ordered the red curry rice & it was one of the best 'fast food' meals I've had in a very long time! I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Food was average. Nothing special. I would try them again if I was at the mall and wanted Chinese food. My nieces dish or orange chicken seemed small for the price and was mostly rice. Mine had enough for leftovers. I did appreciate the cashier. When I said \"no onions\" he also asked \"no green onions either?\"  Most places don't ask this. I appreciated his thoroughness greatly!"}
{"text":"They have a handful of noodle and rice dishes, curry dishes and some asian appetizers like gyoza and spring rolls.  The food is all pretty pricey at around 10 and the portions are smaller with way too little meat.  We tried mongolian beef and broccoli which was VERY bland.  I'm not sure if the broccoli was frozen, but there was water at the bottom.  The meat was overcooked so very tough.  We had to use the Siracha to make it edible.  The kung pao chicken I got with rice instead of noodles.  It was mostly cabbage and peanuts..  No heat pretty much whatsoever.  I think a school cafeteria probably could have done better.  I tried to get bahn mi but the 3 options were lemongrass chicken, chicken teriyaki and steak.  (What, no pork?).  Weird place, way overpriced, almost like Pei Wei - I'm not sure which one's worse."}
{"text":"The bad reviews here are spot on. We stopped by on a Saturday, they had a sign taped on the window stating credit card system was down and was cash only. I thought this was the reason it was dead on a Saturday night! Since the guy taking orders didn't have a register and couldn't do math, he made it easier by rounding up on the prices, instead of the $6.29 for a small dish, lets make it $7, instead of $7.99, lets make it $8. It was a slow night, but we still waited a good 15 minutes for food. I ordered the butter chicken. What I got was a scoop of rice with a few reheated pieces of chicken and a blob of sauce on top. They could have at least mixed it around in a \"Wok\". I also paid $2.49 for the combo upgrade and did not get my spring rolls! I should have checked the cashiers math and my order before I left, both were wrong :( I not only overpaid, but I also got cheated out of food I paid for!"}
{"text":"My friend and I very much enjoyed our lunch here.  I had chicken, udon noodles, Dan Dan style.  My friend had chicken, rice and sweet Mongolian. She has a smaller appetite and finished every bite.  My son had orange chicken and did not enjoy it and they forgot his juice box but otherwise a good experience.  It was very clean when we were there and the bathroom was clean as well.  It may not be authentic but it was yummy!"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service.  Good portion sizes too....had enough to take home for lunch tomorrow. Will be back."}
{"text":"For the love of a little Kimchi...I spent the better part of today dreaming of supper...Big fat noodles, spicy sauce, chopsticks, tender beef and the best part of all...a side Kimchi.   I order without incident but then say the phrase...\" And a side of Kimchi\"...the man behind the counter nonchalantly states \"no Kimchi\"... He says it nonchalantly, without care, as an aside.   He didn't say it apologetically, or with the obviously required shame...I with have been satisfied with a slight lip quiver and an awkward pause... BUT NO... NOTHING...  My meal was ruined and I was left unsatisfied.  After eating I went to use the washroom and to my horror it looked like a teenage runaway gave birth to twins in there.  I brought it to attention of the man at the counter and he noncholantly states \"no paper towels\"....."}
{"text":"Where's the training? These kids don't know how to cook these meals properly. I'm a huge fan of the Indian butter chicken... But it's very inconsistent... Some days it's spot on, and some days it's not or the bread is missing... I don't blame the staff... I blame the franchise owner for cutting corners and hiring inexperienced cooks or lack of training..: you are in a high end part of Gilbert... Either get someone in there that knows what they are doing... Pay them well or else your restaurant will not last... I'm cheering for you though... I love the menu"}
{"text":"Yuck. I got the thai red chili bowl - horrible. Gummy rice, over salted and nothing thai about it. Additionally the crap Lipton iced tea was just awful. Husband got the Singapore cashew chicke which seemed marginally better - but I think the sauce was just pure hoisin sauce. Just don't eat here."}
{"text":"I was excited to have a new casual Asian restaurant open around me so I gave this place a try. I wasn't expecting complete authenticity, but the food did not seem authentic at all. I ordered the Indian Butter Chicken (small size, ten dollars with spring rolls and drink) and it was weirdly sweet, the sauce was like nothing I had tried before, and not in a good way. I also ordered the spring rolls and they had a nice crunch to them but the insides were very mushy. The employees were very polite and nice, but I watched my food be given to another customer, and then taken back. I didn't say anything about it but I do think they prepared me a new dish, so I'm not going to complain about the wait (not even that long, ten minutes maybe). I definitely won't be going back anytime soon, unless I hear about improvements."}
{"text":"This is place is really sad. My mom and I decided to try this place on a whim while we were shopping in the mall. I got the orange chicken and she got the shrimp with chow mein. Her noodles tasted so incredibly bad that she had to order something else. The shrimp was extremely tiny (salad size) for the 7 dollar price. My orange chicken was really bad and tasted like some generic frozen orange chicken from a grocery store. We both felt sick after we left the restaurant,   The place looks pretty nice except for the numerous dirty tables. I really hate to leave bad reviews but the food here is terrible."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, and seem to be on top of things. The fried wontons were good - a little over cooked. The teriyaki rice bowl lacked flavor. The sauce was extremely watery, and the rice was overwatered as well. The meat didn't have any flavor other than the watered down teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"This place is the best. The employees are friendly and enthusiastic, the place is clean, the food is great, and the price is great. They are also gluten free friendly"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  I'm a fan of all types of Asian foods.  Wok Box offers a smattering of Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Thai and Indian inspired dishes.    We've tried a variety of them and all are pretty good.  None are particularly authentic but they are what they are.    There's a guy who must be an owner that sometimes brings out the food, and helps here and there.    Dude, you always seem really cranky.   I assume you are an owner because any employee that always seems so dour, wouldn't be allowed to interact with customers.  But while the food is pretty good, the bottom line is the bottom line.   There are 4 of us.  For about $50, we could eat at a \"real\" restaurant so Wok Box doesn't often make the cut for being a regular stop."}
{"text":"Yeah I'm gonna have to go with the majority here. The food is really mediocre and over priced. I had the \"pad thai\" with shrimp which tasted freezer burned. They went way too heavy with the lime and onion, and it was topped with maybe three peanuts. My girlfriend had the buttered chicken curry, and it was also really bad. Tasted like cheap tomato paste with a hint of curry spice. No one knows how to cook, but the ingredients are just awful. The chicken tasted like it came out of a can.  But the worst part: the \"Vietnamese iced coffee\" is a joke. It was dirty, old maxwell coffee with a pump of Hershey syrup. Huge disappointment and a total lie!"}
{"text":"2 overwhelmed employees, took forever to take order and then forever to have it ready. I was ok waiting because I was craving good pad Thai but I was oh so disappointed. It tasted like burnt wok with tasteless grilled chicken. No peanut sauce or peanuts anywhere. Of course I was home by the time I realized this"}
{"text":"Flavors are good here, almost authentic.  I do recommend trying it for yourself though. This is definitely not Panda, so if you're looking for huge portions on the cheap, try somewhere else... (and maybe reevaluate your diet choices...) I've tried the chicken lemongrass, and the butter chicken, and enjoyed them both.  The servings were more than filling.  The chicken lemongrass had just the right amount of spiciness for me.   I'll update if anything changes,  but so far this place is a win."}
{"text":"Friendly order taker, food was ready in less than ten minutes. I got the pad thai with chicken and chow mein and my hubs got the beef mongolian with rice. We also got some spring rolls. Everything was hot and delicious. The manager came around and asked us how we liked our food. Then at the end we were given to go containers. :) The place was clean and except for some rowdy kids a very nice environment."}
{"text":"Fast food asian stirfry that is a big step up from most fast food joints. This rating is based on comparable options; note that I am not comparing this restaurant to finer dining establishments, granted, they are still better than some! Everything is cooked fresh...no short cuts. I started going here as an alternative to Edo (Wok Box is marginally more expensive but absolutely worth it) .This place provides a combination of comfortable sit down restaurant and quick meal fix. You will be in and out in less than half an hour. Sometimes this is necessary. The quality of the meals is a huge improvement over other fast food restaurants.   There are a variety of stirfries and curries to choose from, which are served on your choice of several types of rice or noodles. You will find better quality veggies than other comparable restaurants and in bigger chunks. You can choose from beef, chicken, shrimp (decent sized) and tofu (I am in heaven to have this choice). There are available condiments such as garlic chili sauce and hoisin sauce if you wish to customize the flavour. There are also fresh garnishes like mint/ cilantro/ peanuts on certain dishes, and several other appetizer and small portion options. This is a far cry from the bland, generic and greasy dumps that most fast food places offer.   The staff (and owner) are remarkably attentive. They always ask about how things were and go out of their way to accomodate requests.  And if you do take out, you get the cute little paper boxes.  Thank you, thank you Wok Box for giving us a true option to burger and fry joints - even though they claim to offer healthier choices and make half-a**ed attempts to add a few options to their menus."}
{"text":"Two of my sons and I ate here for the first time today.  The kids menu is excellent. It had really appropriate food for my 5 year old's taste.  I had be paid Thai and I really liked it. My older son had the chicken rice box and it was delicious.  We tried the Bang bang shrimp as an appetizer.  They were good but we probably wouldn't get an appetizer again because the portions were fairly large."}
{"text":"We came back again while shopping around the mall and could immediately tell the two employees were overwhelmed. There was only one man in line and about 3 other parties. This was at about 2pm today (Sunday).  While we placed our order the cashier kept looking at the lady preparing food and would say \"Do you need to switch me?\"  It took about 18 minutes for our food. I don't mind because its fresh made, but still. You can see where they prepare the food and I know they hadn't started it for about 10 minutes after ordering.  A man ahead of us picked up his food and said his side was missing. Ours had been missing also once we were called up.  The food is a big portion but I only had 2 carrot slices and one piece of brocolli. That doesn't sound bad except it was a vegetarian \"double veggie no protein\" order.   I guess we will come back but if it looks busy we are going elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Not all Wok Box's created equal. This one well run. Good food, one of the better QSR's."}
{"text":"My review is going to seem a little crazy compared to everyone else's on here, but I really enjoyed my food. I also haven't been ill since eating it.   My friend and I came in close to closing and the worker was very friendly and informative of all the menu items, even letting us sample the different sauces. I got a mix of the Pad Thai sauce and Firecracker with Shanghai noodles no peppers, and my friend the orange chicken with chow mein for an extra charge.   The place was empty (we went in late) but very clean. We got our food quickly, and the portions are huge! I liked the presentation and unique bowl shape. My dish was cooked thoroughly, the veggies fresh, and there was a good balance of everything in it. My friend did not like her dish as much, the sauce for her was not as thick as Panda's she said, and it had a lighter, sweeter orange flavor. Personally, I always get migraines from the additives in Panda Expresses' food, and found Wok Box's orange chicken to be much better tasting and higher quality. My friend admits to being too \"American\" for authentic Asian cuisine. Fortune cookies come with each meal and there are saltines on the table to snack on.  I had plenty to take home, and the price is decent enough that I'll come back. I know they do a Monday and Tuesday lunch special and you can text a number for 2 free spring rolls if you check their site for details. I had a good experience overall. Try it if you can handle real Asian food, because it was really good.  Side note about those who got sick: If you are not used to the spices used in this kind of cooking (e.g. chili flakes and kimchi), it might not sit well with your stomach the first time around, so get something mild and work your way up from things like Teriyaki. Just don't be surprised if you find out you started an unexpected cleanse (take comfort knowing it's good for your colon and raises the metabolism)."}
{"text":"I stopped into the Wok Box Fresh Asian Kitchen the other night on their second day of business. I met the husband and wife owners and they seemed like really nice people that care about their customers. The Wok Box is a Canadian based Franchisor. This is the second Franchise to open in the US.  My wife ordered this noodle bowl that we shared and I ordered some spring rolls which were served with plum sauce. The noodle bowl was delicious. The eggrolls came out  a little frozen the first time around. But that was quickly rectified by the owners. I really enjoyed the plum sauce as opposed to the omnipresent orange sauce.  They have a couple of kinks to work out. But the place was comfortable and inviting with a self serve soda machine. They have a lot of different entrees from all over Asia; This includes asian po'boy sandwiches. They are a couple of bucks more than the chinese restaurant we normally go to but it's a nice change of pace. It's always good to have options. The attached link is a trade article which gives you some more information: http://www.restaurantnews.com/wok-box-fresh-asian-kitchen-opens-flagship-scottsdale-az-location/"}
{"text":"Delicious! The noodles (Udon for me) are cooked perfectly and topped with fresh veggies and tasty chicken or whichever meat of your choice.   I couldn't stop eating the noodles coated in a flavorful sauce, even when I had picked out all the toppings.   The servings and price make it a steal!  Great spot for a fast healthy-ish meal."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. The staff was rude, the cashier talked my wife out of what she wanted, what she ended up getting was inedible and they refused to help at all. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Asked if I could get my bowl without the sauce, came with the sauce. Husband was done eating by the time my 2nd bowl arrived. You do not get much for your money. Not sure we will go back."}
{"text":"Oh, Wok Box.   In theory, this place is amazing, but in action, it is not. I'm sad to report that I've eaten there THREE times, despite being disappointed each time.   The stir fry always tastes as if it's been frozen for a while. The spices always leave me wanting, and the Butter Chicken is blasphemy. For the mediocre food you get, it's quite expensive, though it does fill you up.   I like that it's to-go, and I like that it's in a convenient location, but there is so much better food on 17th Av, so don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Did not like I had the fire cracker chicken with brown rice trying to be healthier then with noodles. Yeah not heathy what so ever yuck it had bacon in it and way to much sauce not even good flavor there is nothing health there to eat except the pho I am just not ok ordering that at fast food .   The place is clean and workers were nice also great location they should make it a Zoes"}
{"text":"First time visiting Wok Box tonight with my husband and We were initially excited to try out this new restaurant rather than going to our usual chipotle. I visited their website and was pleased they had some gluten free items since I was recently diagnosed with a wheat allergy.  When we first arrived at the counter they were very friendly and polite girl at the register helped us understand the menu and she pointed out some wheat free options for me. When my husband and I finally ordered, I got the large pad tai and he a large beef dish. Since I've only been gluten free for two weeks, I guess I was not specific enough with my order and about three minutes after I ordered I realized I should check with those cooking behind the counter to ensure my meal was being prepped gluten free. When I asked the woman behind the counter  ( lady with long black straight hair in ponytail working around 6pm) she quickly snapped at me and asked if I had specifically ordered my meal gluten free and then said that they had already made my meal so they would have to make another one for me.  Her tone and reaction caught me by surprise and I said that I thought I did order my meal gluten free, but not wanting to get the sweet cashier girl in trouble for keying my order incorrectly, I didn't make a big deal out of it. When my meal was finally ready, she handed it to me and rudely stated, \"next time make sure to ordered it gluten free, we had already made your meal and we had to make another one!\" Again shocked by her tone, I just stood there, my husband actually came over to defend me but by then I was just done. Horrible, highly rude service. Also, when she remade my meal she gave me the small lunch portion when I paid for the large. She was so rude I'm almost certain she did that on purpose because she was angry about remaking my meal. On a side note, food was bland.  Going forward, we'll still with Chipotle."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this place is right around the corner from my apartment. The location is only a few months old and has a laid-back modern design. They serve up a wide variety of (relatively) healthy Asian dishes at a decent price. It doesn't hurt that they also have a good selection of beer and if you get take out, they even use the Chinese food containers \"like they do in the movies\". Nice.  I haven't tried all of the dishes yet (I will), but so far I am a fan of the Pad Thai, Szechwan Pepper, Korean beef bulgogi, and if you like hot food you should try the \"Dan Dan\" - I love hot and this one was about as hot as they come.    The full menu is here: http://www.wokbox.ca/menu/fresh-asian-kitchen/stir-frys.asp"}
{"text":"Borderline candidate for the regular lunch rotation.  The price point a tad high and the sauce a little too heavy."}
{"text":"Since moving to the SE, I've visited Wok Bok on 130th Ave SE and in Quarry Park.  They have a wide range of Asian foods, and you can get food to go or stay.  Everything from pad thai to pho noodle soup to butter chicken and more.  I tend to go for the noodle dishes, and I've found them to be hit or miss.  For some reason, the flavours just taste off to me.  Kind of bland with no kick.  I do really like their potstickers with ponzu sauce though!"}
{"text":"I ordered the sweet Mongolian chicken and thought it was great.  Especially for the price! It's a fast casual restaurant so no servers which is also a plus to me. I'd like to give it 4.5 but for some odd reason yelps doesn't have halves."}
{"text":"Was super excited to see a wokbox opened up at this location.  I decided to do a quick take out order of honey chicken for lunch. The staff was friendly but it was completely empty when I went in. The decor seems exactly the same as the Gilbert location and was clean. I got my meal home and it was nothing like the way I get it at the Gilbert location. There was practically no sauce at all on the chicken and the white rice was old and dried out tasting. It also had lots of black flakes all over that indicated that it was cooked a burnt, not well cleaned wok. Overall, I am very disappointed with this location and either I will only go to the Gilbert San tan location or will wait for this location to improve. Sad day."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why this place is getting bad reviews. I've had the honey chicken here twice now and both times it was good and tasty. It is quick Chinese food and nicer than a Chinese takeout. I definitely think it blows Panda out of the water as far as taste and quality. The chicken was white meat and not fatty. Overall I like it and would come back."}
{"text":"Found wok box by my work and finally tried it. The food is good, many options and can be customized. These is something for just about everyone. I give them 4 stars because it is not the cleanest restaurant, and also they automatically charge you for a large every time unless you specifically ask for a regular. You would think it would be the other way around. If you haven't been here before it is absolutely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Most expensive cup o' noodles i had. Try to learn how food really taste like. Had a shrimp bowl for $8.99 with 2 pieces of shrimp."}
{"text":"Motivated by a coupon we came here.  They have a limited menu. As their name implies, they do noodle \"boxes\".  Four noodle choices, plus rice if you prefer. We ordered a variety.  We had Dan Dan, Mongolian, a Pho soup, and Indian Butter Chicken.  It is very Americanized.  Not even remotely authentic flavors. Their kung pao isn't spicy (says right on their menu board).  Dan Dan is apparently the kung pao with extra spice, but still not like real kung pao.  Mongolian was tasty. Indian butter chicken sorta tasted Indian, but not really like butter chicken should.  I never thought I would utter this statement, but you'd do better going to Panda Express.  More choices, marginally better food, and a bit less expensive.  I won't be back.  (And, no, I won't go to Panda either.)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Saigon Cashew Chicken noodle bowl togo. I ordered at 7:27 and did not receive my order until 7:52. That is way too long to wait for this sort of cuisine.  I ordered and paid for a regular order and took home a small. I added on the two sping rolls and a drink, after $12+ spent I'm still hungry! What a waste. The dish tasted good but for the wait time and order inaccuracy I would not be back."}
{"text":"Didn't look like any reviews here so we tried it.  Guess it's a chain. But was great food.  Spicy. Great stating in front.  Good comfy chairs.  Inside they had an easy menu to figure out.  Looks like gluten free options (I posted a picture of them).   The staff was nice and helpful.  Didn't look at me funny when I asked for an extra fortune cookie.  Got something firey something. Almost too hot but not quite.  BTW I did use chopsticks (fork in picture was a size prop)."}
{"text":"My review is much like Tracy T's. This is the first and last time I will eat at Wok Box. Luckily for me, I used a Groupon for my order which saved me about 40%. Even with another 40% off I would not eat there again. I ordered the buttered curry chicken with white rice and naan. My wife got the Mongolian shrimp with noodles. Upon opening my box, I noticed it was only half full. It had grilled chicken on top and some sauce covering the chicken. I was very unimpressed with the portion size for a $10 meal at a take out joint. The sauce was only okay but there was not enough of it to go around. The chicken was good but not anything more. The naan tasted like a spongy piece of blah. My wife's meal had a TON of noodles and very little shrimp. The shrimp were quite tiny and very rubbery.     Since we got our meals for take out, I decided to call and speak to a manager to inquire about our concerns. The manager tried to tell me that they fill the boxes and the food settles about 1/3 of the way down the box. That's a lot of air in the food!  The manager did not seem to care much about our concerns. No sorry, or please give us another try. She only said she would pass the word along????  I'm not sure what that means, but okay!  If I could give 1/2 star I would!"}
{"text":"My cousins and I came here this past weekend because we wanted to try something new. I ordered the fire cracker chicken bowl with noodles. I didn't expect to see bacon in there, so that was quite a surprise. The bowl was just okay, there wasn't anything too exciting about it. The fortune cookie was pretty good, I'd say better than the meal itself. It's not your normal fortune cookie you get at other Chinese places, plus I won a free drink and 2 spring rolls, so that was nice. Would I come again? Maybe. Maybe next time I'll try something different."}
{"text":"Loved this place, great customer service, down to letting me try the ingredients they were gonna use on different dishes to help me make my decision. Nice fresh, none greasy food, cooked well! Coming back!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I loved the firecracker sauce with chow mein noodles. The food was very hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"I know it's hard to rate a franchise, but the staff and owners here are lovely. Ate in w our 1.5 year old daughter today and they gave her a comp. juice box, had endless smiles for her while she wandered around the restaurant, then made sure we left w more than enough fortune cookies. Super family friendly, and kind staff. Also, fresh, hot and tasty food."}
{"text":"The staff here is very friendly and that stood out to me Immediately. I ordered the butter chicken and it was delicious, not to mention such a large portion. Of course you have your different sizes you can choose but overall this place is awesome to sit down and have a meal or take out. I also recommend the beef and broccoli as it is my favorite."}
{"text":"I ordered jungle noodle for my little one and Mongolian beef and broccoli for myself for lunch yesterday. My little almost 2 years old had a bite of her noodie and then no more. Everything taste way too sweet!"}
{"text":"My daughter suggested we try this place last night. 1st of all I wasn't impressed by the rude red headed person behind the counter she ignores us as she she appeared to be the night manager until a nice young girl came up to the counter. I can only assume was new as she seemed just as confused about the menu as we were. Unable to answer our question, $30 dollars later (way over priced for this disgusting tasting food) for one fried rice isn't supposed to be wet and soggy and super salty for two the orange chicken taste like something other than foam with no sauce just plopped in a bowl with soggy white rice this time. So I attempt to try it give it a chance, my daughter tries it and thinks the same, what exactly is this? Literally something just thrown together out of a bag. So I keep my composure and tell said rude red head nicely that the fried rice is really just too salty and soggy and the so called orange chicken with no flavor and no sauce is just not very good. She says well the fried rice is gonna be salty it has soy sauce in it and we don't have anymore fried rice so I'm gonna have to refund you for it, so I'm like great cuz I don't want anything else from here. Then she says I can just give you more sauce for the orange chicken and abruptly squeezes out some cold sauce from a squeeze bottle into a small container and gives it to me and walks away. Again so rude. Needless to say definitely not worth your time or money combined with the aweful lack of service and terrible reheated frozen packaged food. This place sucks big time!!! You've been warned try at your own risk."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about.  Great location, wish it was a Pei Wei!  Food is inconsistent."}
{"text":"Workers were not helpful informing me of what I was getting as it was my first time. Food was greasy and still kind of cold. No flavor. And the spring rolls seemed like they came from Safeway."}
{"text":"Nice place for a quick lunch. The owners are very 'present', which is cool. You definitely get plenty of food if you order the combo. It's a little pricey for an every day lunch (about $13 for my combo), but like I said - there is a ton of food. If you are light eater, you will have leftovers for sure. This location has the (pretty darn spicy) Dan Dan option, which is very good."}
{"text":"I like the concept and the food came out pretty damn quickly, but I probably shouldn't have ordered the Pad Thai. It just wasn't very good. The flavor wasn't right and the noodles were pretty mushy.  I would consider trying them out again, probably trying something a little more \"safe\"."}
{"text":"So sad when a great concept and location is marred by grumpy service and bad food. Spicy Dandan sauce is inedible. Thai salad is dressed with the same over spiced sauce.  The manager? replaced the Thai salad with a flavorless chicken salad topped with mandarin oranges that are spoiled.   Big miss team!"}
{"text":"After a bad experience a few months ago, decided to give them another try.  Daughter ordered kids meal, she wanted a fountain drink instead of juice box...no dice.  Too many good options near/in Santan  to come back again."}
{"text":"Dirty. Rude manager. She was discussing \"lazy Jews\" with another woman employee! She should not be running a restaurant or ANY kind of business.  Get yourself an education and study state health standards!"}
{"text":"Closed! Website still say open, but sign on window says, \"Available.\" Outgoing voicemail also neglects to mention they are closed."}
{"text":"Cute name.  Cute concept.  Had the kung pao noodle dish which was surprising lacking in any pow.  I had to search around for the pieces of chicken.  Still I thought it was good enough to eat - nothing special but not too bad.     I also ordered the sampler which is a bunch of so called small bites.  I was thinking appetizer but they call you to the counter when everything is done.    The sampler included cold practically still frozen edamame and a bunch of items that seriously looked like they came straight out of a box from the frozen section in my grocery store.  The partially frozen edamame was pretty much par for the course.  Pun intended."}
{"text":"The food I've always gotten here is very fresh. Never spicy though. If you like spicy like I do, make sure to find some way for them to kick it up a notch. The food is a little pricey but for me, it makes two meals so I can't complain. The place always seems clean to me."}
{"text":"I had a chicken teriyaki bowl with the yellow noodles that looks like udon. It was so darn delicious. The flavors were good, the temperature was hot veggies were Fresh, the cilantro and green onions are fresh and crisp. Never heard of this place before but was at the village and had to try it. Can't wait to come back to this place to eat."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good a little pricey for almost 10 bucks you only got your box dinner enough for one but no drink or egg roll not even fortune cookie.   But it was good I have to say that  it about the same had a Panda Express   But they garnish it with some fresher things.  All in all I'd eat there again maybe for lunch maybe they have lunch specials."}
{"text":"It's a really good concept but the execution in authentic flavors for each region falls a little short.  Every dish we tried was a bit off.  We had the Indian Butter Chicken, Thai Lemongrass Curry, Samosas (that was probably the best item) and some weird Korean Firecracker Riceball.  (I'm Korean and my Eomma would be like \"what the truck is this?\")  Kind of reminds me of Trader Joe ethnic food but if you like the real, authentic deal then this place is probably not your speed."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the place looks clean but food was pretty bad.  The place looks like your typical fast casual franchise. It has a well thought out design and it is clean but it certainly feels a bit hollow and fake.   The food was pretty bad considering the prices were on par with a standard sit down restaurant. The teriyaki sauce was watered down and extremely sweet (to the point of being sugary). The chow mein noodles lacked any real flavor. The meat was about the same quality you would expect from taco bell and the veggies certainly were not fresh.  Bottom line if you are starving I suppose you can eat here but this is just another mediocre chain in a sea of chain \"restaurants.\""}
{"text":"Awful, over priced, fast food.  Not enough sauce, veggies, or meat in the noodles.  This place is not going to last long in the area.  Too expensive for what you get.  Skip it."}
{"text":"First time visitor and probably the last.  I order three different boxes. . .all of which should have come with a variety of veggies, which really turned out to be a box of noodles.  One of the meals had three strips of tofu.  Another had 1.5 pieces of broccoli, again all noodles.  Mongolian beef box had zero beef.  There were probably 5 slices of carrot between 3 meals.  Flavor was great but the boxes should be renamed Noodle Boxes.  Great profit, Total cost of 3 boxes of noodles and 1 box of spring rolls, 28 dollars.  Lesson learned.  Truly a shame.  Staff was very friendly. . . but that doesn't make a quality meal"}
{"text":"Horrible.   I went to the new location in Airdrie, had the ginger beef, veggies and rice.  For veggies, it was 2 pieces of green pepper, and some onion.  I didn't eat it all.  Would not go back.  A little pricey for low quality food, and no 'asians' were working there, yet they call it asian cuisine."}
{"text":"I know it's fast food and all, but the curried noodles I ordered was pretty much inedible. Not sure I'm brave enough to try again."}
{"text":"Surprisingly bland food, extremely long wait for small line of customers, and poor customer service clearly led by poor management.  Basically what everyone else said."}
{"text":"I come here every time I have a cold or allergies and order the \"Dan Dan\".  No sinus issues today, but was feeling a bit dangerous. I asked them to make the 'Dan Dan' as hot as possible and they totally did!I was already loyal to this specific Wok Box, and they managed to turn up the heat (literally). I will keep coming back for the awesome food and service!"}
{"text":"Yuck!   I saw this place open up not too long ago and was excited to try it out. I went in tonight with low expectations, keeping in mind that this is still a \"fast-food type\" place, but the food was just awful. I am not a Panda Express fan, so I wouldn't suggest you go there, but you may as well (considering what they serve here)!  I ordered Vietnamese Beef Pho, Kung Pao Chicken, and a Vietnamese Iced Coffee.  The Iced Coffee was pre-mixed and poured into my cup from a large plastic container; you could get better pre-mixed iced coffee from 7-11 at half the cost. Don't be deceived; this is not what Vietnamese Iced Coffee should taste like.  The Pho was very bland and inedible, and is the worst I've tasted in my life (no exaggeration). The broth was completely flavorless; I believe they just used the water they boiled the noodles in. The noodles were thick and mushy. The beef was in cut in chunks (not-sliced) and was very tough. I just couldn't get myself to finish this.  The Kung Pao Chicken didn't taste as bad as the other two items, but was pathetic for what you pay. The portion is small; there are only a few pieces of chicken with very little vegetables. The container was mostly sauce and rice.  ...very disappointing."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, & helpful staff. They offer small or large dishes so get as much or as little you want. We had the Dan Dan with shrimp & Butter Chicken. Omg! Amazing! Staff was so nice. Answered all our questions & made great suggestions. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I think the overall review score here is really spot on. It's good but nothing is great. A nice fast casual concept butt nothing special. I usually get the Pad Thai  and it does the job. I think this is a great place to grab and go in a hurry but not much else."}
{"text":"The location looks and feels like the San Tan Village location in Gilbert. Staff was super friendly and polite, offering to get refills, carry our drinks (even hold our infant daughter!). They cleared our plates as well.  Food was hot and fresh -  Sweet Mongolian, and my wife had the firecracker. Tried a cold noodle salad, the dressing wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be. Misters out front, but not sure if there were tables."}
{"text":"Was my first time in since it opened, went last night w/ a large group (15+). The food is good, especially for just being opened- they have the recipe/technique down! The managers were there helping check on patrons and fetch refills (it's self serve).  I had the Dan Dan noodles w/ chicken. It was very spicy - for reference- PF Changs Dan Dan noodles would score a 6.5/10 on spiciness, this place would be an 8/10. I think it's the hottest item on the menu, but I'm sure you could ask for any of their other spicy dishes to have the heat turned up.  There are two sizes for your dish - regular and large?  There are 4 kinds of noodles you can choose from if you wish to substitute - Chowmein, Shanghai, Udon, Ribbon.  They seem to be very dietary conscious - offering a menu with substitution recommendations for wheat/gluten allergy (use rice ribbon noodle),  vegetarian, and possibly vegan? I know there was also someone in our group w/ a peanut allergy; they have a separate wok for cooking up nut free (cashew, peanut, etc) items, and another wok for gluten free items.  Tables have sriracha hot sauce (aka rooster sauce), and soy. There are chopsticks, regular utensils, etc placed in a few locations. Soda fountain has Pepsi products, and there is some iced tea flavors as well. The menu also listed Vietnamese Iced Coffee.  It's located on the South side of SanTan Village -  same side as Barnes & Noble, Chipotle, and Kona Grill. Close to home for me so I'll definitely frequent it for lunch or dinner.  Note - this isn't an authentic Asian owned and operated Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, or Asian place liked you'd experience in country; its a chain (large in Canada?) so don't expect it to taste like a Bahn Mi made on a cart on the streets of Saigon or Pad Thai made at a restaurant in Bangkok."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Scottsdale! I had the butter chicken naan wrap and the Vietnamese coffee. Both were delicious! Customer service was excellent as well! If this place was closer to home, I would frequent more often."}
{"text":"This place blows away the place that has a Panda as their logo.  The food is fresh and delicious.  As an added bonus your meal is available in 3 different sizes.  The place is really clean and the service here is exceptional.  I'll be back often."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is the fortune cookies and the free entrees you win when opening.  First time visiter: Started out by walking in on a Saturday night and the place was dead. That was a bad sign. Placed our \"take out\" order (large teriyaki chicken, small honey chicken, and a kids meal) $23 total! We were really excited about eating some fresher food than the nearby Panda Express. Took a long time to get our food and when we got it we were missing our spring rolls. The manager gave us a $7 off our next visit.  Got home, and the small entree was THE SAME SIZE AS THE KIDS MEAL. There was NO flavor in the dishes. My 10 year old daughter couldn't even eat her meal cause she was so disgusted. It tasted like those frozen Chinese dinners that you buy at the grocery store. Kids meal had probably like 5 pieces and the small entree had the same amount. They were like chicken fingers from the freezer. I was so disappointed and will ONLY go back one other time cause of the $7 coupon, and the free entree fortune that came in my cookie.  This place will be gone in a few months."}
{"text":"I was heading home, debating what to do for dinner when I walked by Wok Box and decided to give it a try. The interior is cute and I really liked the big menus up on the wall - made it easy to make my choice. The staff was very friendly & didn't hesitate to let me know what the most popular flavours were when I asked. You can watch them make the food right in front of you, so you know it's fresh.  That said, I was disappointed that I couldn't get my regular \"less rice, more veggies.\" It's either the regular, or no rice and double the veggies. I'm not sure why somewhere in between is such an issue (I went with no rice).  The little box it comes in is cute (not sure why I love those so much) - the fare was pretty typical. I got the stirfry chicken w/ Signapore Cashew sauce. Pretty good, nothing outstanding. Overall, an okay experience but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and faster than usual service.   Now if only Aspen Landing wasn't such a pain to find parking in."}
{"text":"Meh. I should have known better.  While walking around Santan Mall area I looked for a place to eat, and being in the mood for Chinese I thought i'd give this place a try. I ordered my food (the cashier was on HER phone and told me to wait for her to finish the call---it's okay, i'll wait). I sat down and waited for my food to come, it took a while, but it came. I picked it up, and asked the guy behind the counter for a fortune cookie for the end of my meal and he pulled one out of his pocket to give me...Weird. Nonetheless, I sat down and began my meal. It was awful, the chicken the bland, the chow mein was raw, and to top it all off-- I found a hair in it. Blekh. I got up and was about to say something till I noticed one of the chefs who kept wiping his brow, basically over the food. It was gross, and I knew it wasn't worth trying to talk my meal over with. Hey at least the bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"Yum! The curry & steak sandwich were great. Very fresh!"}
{"text":"Decent tasting food options here. I've tried a few noodle dishes. Flavors are good. But for the price, servings are small. It's an upgraded version of Panda Express - nicer food options and ambiance - in my mind that doesn't justify an average of $12 for a lunch entree + soda."}
{"text":"I have tried this location of Wok Box a couple of times now and overall I think it's pretty good. I have tried the Dan Dan Noodle bowl with chicken which is a spicy sauce with udon noodles. The large bowl is pretty big, enough for me to take some home. The flavor of the sauce is really good but a little on the syrupy side.   The egg rolls served with the bowls are a little off tasting. Very small and oily. Service has been okay on both of my visits. I would not go out of my way to come back but I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Overall okay experience."}
{"text":"I had a decent experience at the Wok Box yesterday. I told the gentleman taking my order that it was my first time there and asked him if he had any suggestions, I  told him I love anything spicy. He quickly just pointed to the Dan Dan noodle bowl which said it was very spicy on the menu, not much help there. While I did see that it said very spicy on the menu, I would have appreciated his opinion if anything else might have had better flavor but clearly he didn't have much of one. Anyhow, I decided to order the Dan Dan noodle bowl with chicken. I ordered a small noodle bowl combo with two small spring rolls and a drink. He informed me that he would call my number when the order was ready. I went to find a seat. He forgot to get me a drink and by the time I had realized this, there were 4 other people in line and he was very busy. They looked understaffed and he looked overwhelmed. When my noodle bowl came out I let him know I was missing a drink. He did get me a cup right away. The drink machine is awkwardly placed behind the order counter by the bathrooms and is not easily accessible when a lot of people are in line, bad design.  The bowl itself was good. I thought the Dan Dan noodles tasted great and had good flavor. Definitely spicy and garlicy. The small spring rolls were just okay and tasted kind of weird oily aftertaste and the sweet and sour sauce was way too sweet. The chicken in the noodle bowl was also just okay and I would have honestly just preferred more noodles because the chicken wasn't the best. Overall it was an okay experience. I wouldn't rule out eating here again completely because they do have some other flavors on the menu that look good but I would have to write and update because based on the other reviews, consistency with quality seems to be a problem here."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place for quick, quality food with great presentation.  Not served in Togo containers lol."}
{"text":"They totally burned and fried my pad thai didn't look anything like pad thai. For a dollar is all never go back there again sorry this is a horrible review I hope your experience is better."}
{"text":"The Wok Box is a great place.  My wife and I came here with our two kids and the service was top notch. My son has really bad allergies for everything and the store manager came up with a sauce and meal specific to my boy. Also he recommended the Indian Butter Chicken for me and man was it amazing. It did not disappoint! My wife got the sweet and sour chicken bowl and that was great too, very filling. It only cost about 8 bucks. Great location and great food!"}
{"text":"Clean, great food, generous portions, super employees, unbelievable prices, and they grill their chicken...everything isn't drowned in oil.  We will never go to Pei Wei or PF Changs again!!!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me to try this if I liked Panda. I did and gotta say. I just didn't do it for me. You know a place is not worth recommending if I didn't even finish my \"box\". Place is a fast casual Asian Diner with a limited menu. As you well know on Fridays I do Not eat meat so I felt like some Shrimp and remembered a friend telling me about Wok Box. Noodles were not cooked to my liking, didn't expect big shrimp for $8 and didn't get big shrimp. More like a 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"If you are in the area and looking for a tasty bite to eat, keep on looking. I ordered the lemongrass curry box with chicken. The box was roughly 75% rice, 20% vegetables, and 5% meat = 100% disappointment. The lemongrass curry sauce was listed as \"spicy\" on their menu, however, that was far from true. Bland and dry is a more accurate description. I was not able to finish my meal. Was not impressed and will not return."}
{"text":"It's good for the fast-food kind place it is supposed to be. The first time I went, I bought a Groupon and ordered an iced vietnamese coffee, dan dan noodles and singapore noodles. The vietnamese coffee was kinda gross, but I should have not expected much from the kind of place it is. The dan dan noodles were so far removed from the dish the namesake is from that I had a hard time enjoying it. It tasted fine, but not anything I would ever order again.  The singapore noodles, also very different from the dish it's named after, were surprisingly quite yummy. It had a wonderful peanuty-sauce and plenty of veggies. I have gone back once more with a couple friends and I ordered the same--the singapore noodles.   You just have to order from the menu and try to distance yourself from the dish's name otherwise if you're expecting the actual flavors from the dish's name, you'll be disappointed.   The service is always friendly and welcoming. Unfortunately, I probably won't be back for a while because I no longer work in the area."}
{"text":"Good food. Enjoy the noodle bowls. Have had good service at Chandler and Gilbert locations."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the food here, but it honestly was a big disappointment.  The vegetables did not taste fresh and the meal we ordered for my daughter was terrible. We had to go to get something else for her to eat - Yes, it was that bad.  My husband got lucky, his meal wasn't too bad.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in today for lunch. I wasn't really sure what I wanted, but we decided to split because the portions seemed huge. After looking at the menu outside, I decided I wanted their version of beef and broccoli, so we entered the restaurant. The inside is rather small, but it is decorated with bright colors and feels very open. You can watch them preparing the food before your eyes and can see all the ingredients lined up.   Luckily, there's a menu above the ordering counter that is visible from almost anywhere in the store. As we waited in line, my order slowly changed from beef and broccoli (with rice) to Mongolian beef (with noodles) to Kung Pao with shrimp. (Due to my husband's subtle and clever persuasions.) I saw Vietnamese Iced Coffee on the menu and was sold. It was quick and easy to place our order and we didn't have to wait long. We ordered it to go, but when it was ready it wasn't packaged to go. An employee was quick to package it up and made light conversation with me. He expressed how much he really enjoys the iced coffee and I agreed - it was really good. I asked if they made it fresh every day and he confirmed that they did. He also pointed to the canisters of coffee that were lined up and talked about the brand a bit.   Overall, the customer service was great and I loved my iced coffee. The Kung Pao Shrimp wasn't my favorite, but it could have been because that wasn't what I wanted originally. The portion was rather large - definitely can make two meals out of it. I'll be back for some more coffee and to try some of their other offerings!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here as I was in need of some food in a hurry and this place looked interesting as I drove by. Upon entering I was a bit confused on where to order. What I thought was the order line was the pick up line. The lit menus were in an odd place as well and were crudely hung with extension cords strung over the overall nice interior space of the restaurant. The menu design was sort of a poorly done chipotle style ordering scheme. (Size, protein, noodle or rice, and ingredients).   It was probably a good plan but it's confusing. Hard to explain and not worth the time to do so.    The people were extremely nice, prompt and very caring. The food was just food, not amazing and not terrible. The location was very nice inside with a large mural of a chinese street. However, I will forget what I even had in a day or so.  The shrimp were the size of a nickel as well.  Also, who serves cold edamame?  (The chef recommended it not be warmed up?)  Overall, not good. I won't be back but others may enjoy it. I found the food to be overly prepared and not appetizing. Again, staff was amazing!"}
{"text":"Bad.. I truly can't believe they are still in business at this point. I ate here with 2 other people and not a single one of us liked what we ate. The manager that took our order was rude and not friendly at all. I over heard a conversation he had with a customer and he was so 'matter of fact' and not considerate at all. We left the Wok Box saying 'Well, we found a place we will never go to again.' Bad service, bad food, and bad vibes. Not a fan..."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. The place looks clean. I like that they have Sriracha hot sauce on every table. The menu is interesting and all over the place, but the thai red curry and the indian butter chicken are both good! I've ordered to-go and I received my food very quickly."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, had spicy noodles.  The staff had a good sense of humor and the food was good."}
{"text":"Came back after some time and even though it was cooked fresh it tasted odd to me. Can't put my finger on it. The cook was delightful but I asked  if they can not make it spicy and the employee said they are all set the way they are. Not their fault but it is food and I can even modify a Big Mac."}
{"text":"Good food, big portions, and full of flavour.  Went for dinner last night and split an order of lemon curry chicken with a nine year old.  Realized after ordering that they do have a kids menu - for only $4 per order - but when we got the bowl, I was happy we'd split it as I'd never have been able to finish by myself.  It definitely had a spicy kick, with lots of veggies and chicken.  And, only $10.50 for the whole order!  Also, they have glass cups for water, and if you stay, the food comes in 'real' bowls - paper is only for take out.  Good service, lots of tables... I will be back!"}
{"text":"I brought a groupon to this place after checking their menu & yelp reviews. Brought To-Go a Rice Box - Indian Butter Chicken (I'm an Indian) & a Noodle Box - Singapore Cashew.   Had the rice box for lunch & it was just OK - the spice level was decent as promised & the usage of different spice ingredients (definitely not Indian) made the butter chicken \"interesting\". What pissed me off was the missing Naan bread from the box (Not sure if they missed it intentionally or by accident) - MAKE sure you ask for it next time you order. Saving the Noodle box for dinner (Looks quite promising at this point).   FINAL VERDICT: Wanted to try this place cz the menu looked interesting (yes, fusion it is). The place looked well organized & maintained to me. For the quantity, I say they are a little pricey (again, Where is my Naan bread peeps?). I'd probably go here another time just for the \"fusion\" experience, but NOT anytime soon!  UPDATE: Had the Noodle Box for dinner & O.M.G - one of the best I've ever tasted! Perfect balance of flavor & well cooked. Change of plan, I'd definitely visit this place again to try out their other noodle dishes.Dan-Dan, anyone?"}
{"text":"Second and last time here.  Pad thai tasted nothing like Thai food.  Very little sauce.  Kung pao chicken with rice was gummy and pasty.  Crispy Orange Chicken had zero flavor.  I doubt this place will be open much longer~"}
{"text":"Quick, fresh and we'll served. Nice place to stop in for a quick dinner. Clean and child friendly right next to the San Tan Mall."}
{"text":"I've tried really hard to like this place, but they mess my order up two out of three times and then act like jerks when I ask them to fix it. I'm never rude, mistakes happen, but geez get it right!!!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Wok Box was great. My second, however, was terrible. I tried the sampler and usually I'm the type of person that doesn't hate food. This was gross. I don't know the names of everything on that platter but two of the four were DISGUSTING. And cold. We also ordered edamame and it was FREEZING cold. Like it had just come from ice. On top of that, the soda machine didn't have CO2 so they could not serve any more sodas and the lady that explained this to us was not very friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered food to go from here and what a fun surprise! The food came in a adorable little Chinese to go box with a cute little handle. Not only that but the food was delicious! The cheesy kimchi fire balls are delicious and I wish I ordered more. I also got the beef bulgolgi with rice, which was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Worst place I have ever been to!    Tables are dirty, menu is odd, and the only thing good is the cashier guy.   I, of course, have high standards for Asian food. Unfortunately, this place that seems so promising was an epic fail. My bbq pork buns was very much off its rocker. The buns were hard and lack the fluffy consistency that it should have. Edible but is it enjoyable? Absolutely NOT!! The Thai beef and basil naan was no where near a marriage of Asian fusion. Why double on carbs...rice and naan together? Finally, why oh why would you call it Thai? I'm Thai and that is nothing close to what we have in my country. Embarrassing.   Overall, I would suggest skipping this place until they rethink/revamp their menu and cleanliness."}
{"text":"So so, Tokyo Joes is much better. Beef n broccoli bowl was about half full compared to my Singapore Cashew, which was a full bowl, we both got regular size. Peanut sauce was lacking peanut flavor, for a bit I thought I had teriyaki, though it was really good. Beef was a bit tough. Might go back again to try something else."}
{"text":"I was starving tonight and went for a walk down 17th....is it just me or is there nothing different, fast and yummy on our city's main drag- Well there's one great place...Wok Box! I had Butter Chicken. It was awesome! Like better than most Indian restaurants. It was a generous portion, so much so that i have my lunch for tomorrow. I ordered a Kingfisher Indian beer with it and it just made my night. I love this place and can't wait to try all the other menu items."}
{"text":"Dammit, I wish that I would have read the other peoples' reviews before I ate here. As loathe as I am to agree with all of the other guailo who complain about how crappy this place is, I can't help but concede that they're all right. This place doesn't even rate as mediocre, but I did give them one extra star for the food being freshly prepared. However, the people who have mentioned that they skimp on the protein weren't exaggerating. I got a bowl and included shrimp, and I swear there were at most six tiny little brine shrimp- I'm pretty sure they were just large krill. I'd honestly rather have a plate of lukewarm Panda Express any days.   I can't imagine this place remaining for long. The only reason that I came here was because I was slightly hung over, in the area, and Blue Wasabi (which I want to try) was closed. I won't be back, and honestly I'd recommend anyone in the area to stick with Chipotle.  Blah."}
{"text":"Really tasty food, good price, friendly employees  and clean establishment.  Will return."}
{"text":"What a great little place in North Scottsdale.  Good food, with very helpful staff (I think they are the owners) who are always ready to help you with your order or explain anything you might need.   The spicy Dan Dan noodles are fantastic as is the slightly sweeter Mongolian.   The only bad thing about this place is the parking.  The shopping center has a very strange in and out configuration often making it confusing and slow."}
{"text":"Had a decent experience at Wok Box. My take out was done in about 5 minutes. Portions are very large and filling. It doesn't taste that great though. I had the firecracker noodles. I am very hesitant to try their pho as they are not exactly a Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"Wok Box.  Amazing.  As soon as you walk in you are happily greeted \"Welcome to Wok Box!\" by the energetic staff!  Then while I was looking at the menu deciding what to order I was greeted by the owner and his wife, they gave me a run down of the menu and I decided to go with the Sweet Mongolian.  After placing my order I watched it go through all the steps of making it, my favorite was watching the wok!  Man that guy was good!  I herd the other employees refer to him as the \"Wok Master\", I would certainly agree!    Once I got my order, I sat down and started to look around.  That's when I realized how amazing the decor is, beautiful wood design with a very large Asian mural on the wall.  Now, lets talk about the food.  Not much to say other then it was amazing!  The beef was extremely tender and the sauce was perfect.  It could not of been better.  All in all, Pei Wei will not be seeing much of me anymore!"}
{"text":"For the price and for the flavor I give them a thumbs down. Flavor isn't what I expected, & the spring rolls at Costco are even better. I don't think I'd be back."}
{"text":"This place has a similar flare to that of Pick-Up Stix and could easily have 5 stars as the food is excellent and the restaurant is really clean, but I can't get over the fact this place nickels and dimes you for every little thing. I'm not the biggest veggie fan and have often asked to substitute the veggies for something else, like extra noodles. I'm always told no and that it would be an extra $1.99 for extra noodles. The manager did not pick up on my sarcasm when I asked if there is a charge for a side of siracha...there is a charge for a side of teriyaki sauce or sweet and sour sauce. So I ordered a regular order of the teriyaki beef without veggies and my wok box was literally less than half full (see picture) and said if I wanted extra noodles, I'd have to pay extra. This place should change their name to \"Gyp Box.\""}
{"text":"For quick Asian cuisine, I found the Wok Box to be a perfect place to go for a fix.  The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean and well laid out.  I had the coconut curry which had a perfect amount of spice and was really good.  It had a little too much rice for my liking but I got plenty of food for my money.  My visit was towards the end of the lunch hour, so it was relatively calm, but I can see the place being a bit of a zoo during busy times, especially with the parking lot being as jammed up as it usually is.  If you can deal with that, give it a shot."}
{"text":"This place was great when it first opened but now it seems to be hit or miss. Last few times I've called in a simple order they have gotten it wrong. Wrong rice, no sauce for Sweet N Sour Chicken, charged us for a large adult order for my daughters kids portion. When i say something I get an excuse with attitude. Too bad, the food is good when they get it right"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and I just like the noodles they have. Nothing they have is special. The kimchi balls lack spice and flavor. There is nothing hot about them. The egg rolls are good but super mini. I just bought a bag of the exact same ones at Costco. And I noticed their to go portions are way smaller then if you dine in. Not cool!   After our last order we probably won't be back. It's just not worth the $"}
{"text":"Their CLOSING & I can see why. My daughter and I chose to eat here yesterday, big mistake! When we arrived at the cashiers station two gals were there. We looked up to view the menu & one of them told us to come look at the \"updated\" one that was tapped to the table! Many items were blacked out with a sharpie. I said; \" what's with all these marked out\"? That's when they informed us: \"we are closing in less than two weeks\".. Stupid me- I should have backed out then! The cashier ( with short dark hair & glasses- no name tag) seemed abrupt & irritated when having to explain the process & options. Horrible customer service!  My daughter went with the Sweet Mongolian with Beef & I got Hong Kong Curry with Shrimp. When we placed our food order & asked for a drink, all they had available in the soda machine was Diet Coke & Sprite. OK?!! My daughters meal was prepared and ready way before mine. They called her name to pick up and as she made her way over, I smelled a rancid scent, I thought it was coming from the kitchen as though something burned! Come to discover I believe her meal was beyond over cooked. There was a bitter taste to it and black specks throughout the meal.She could hardly manage her way through it. As I still waited for my meal, they claimed that they had to remake it as the cook made it with beef not shrimp?! I believe he burnt mine as well and had to start over! I finally was called to pick up my bowl. It was so bland, noodles were dry. It honestly was probably one of the worst, if not the worst Asian meal I've ever had.   We spent over $17 on two meals and a drink. Super disappointing. BTW- I asked \"what the new place will be\"?- they didn't know. I asked \"when it will reopen\"?- they didn't know. LOL Don't come here, Closing! Out of soda & out of stock on many food products.  You'll be so dissatisfied with the whole experience. The staff doesn't want to be there and the cooks could care less!"}
{"text":"Now, I do not want to get overly critical about a fast food stir fry place. Obviously I have learned to lower my standards a notch or two when it comes to such options, and I know that I can't expect an Open Sesame, or Cafe Koi stir fry experience.  However, this place just kind of creeps me out. Nestled in the bleak, soulless power center area of 130th Avenue, Wok Box is one of the only places with vegan options close to my work (which is uncharacteristically nestled in an equally bleak and soulless industrial area between McKenzie and Douglasdale). Having never tried Wok Box but hearing good things about it from my roommate (who actually, is not very picky. I should have known better), I decided to give it a go.  Stepping inside, I felt like I had just walked into a casino in the day time or something. Not because people were throwing handfuls of quarters into slot machines or smoking inside, but because I couldn't tell what time of day it was as soon as I stepped inside and it made me uncomfortable. It was all loungey and tacky inside. I was initially going to stay in and read my book, but was just way creeped out by the empty, dimly lit establishment. I did not like it. It confused me. Either, you try and be classy and serve quality food to match, or you live with the fact that you are a fast food establishment and get over yourselves, please.  My regular mongolian tofu stir fry (which was plenty for me, but I could imagine others still being hungry) came to a whopping $11 with no drink or side items added. Considering I can make my own stirfry at Open Sesame for the same amount, I was a little unimpressed, especially with the quality of not-properly-cooked udon noodles (the kind you can buy at T&T market for like $0.68) and obviously canned baby corns which tasted like they hadn't been rinsed. What exactly am I paying $11 for? The aforementioned tacky loungey atmosphere? Or to cover the wages of the staff, who were actually text messaging in front of me instead of tending to my stirfry (you can see everything cooking). When I received it in its box, it was a hot mess with all of the crappy vegetables on the bottom and the noodles nestled on top.  I just left way too long of a review about a chain establishment, but I am overall not impressed, and next time will make my stirfry at home like always."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time not really knowing what to expect.  The menu has a different concept in ordering.  I had the teryaki bowl.  It was ok, but not something that I would get again.  My daughter had the sweet and sour chicken and it was great.  I usually get take-out and I think that the sweet and sour chicken would not be good for take-out because it would probably get soggy.  It is great to eat in."}
{"text":"OK, *please* read my whole review. Two points to make, A and B.  A. In the 90s, in China, there was this hugely popular type of restaurant that served \"California Beef Noodles\" which everyone in China thought was native California cuisine, but of course, it was just Chinese beef noodles. But, who cares so long as the food tastes good, right? -- I've gone to Wok Box a few times now. For anyone expecting the Chinese/Viet/Japanese/etc. named dishes to taste like the stuff you get in China/Vietnam/Japan/etc. or even taste like what you could get in an American big-city China-town, etc., then you will be hugely disappointed. Not even remote. ***BUT*** if you walk in and DON'T have that expectation, then, as grub goes, it tastes just fine, especially for the price. Compared to the crap you would get for the same price at other joints, the food here is downright great.  B. Everything else, the cleanliness, the service, the interior, the quality of the ingredients.... are SUPER! This is a well-managed little restaurant.!  Bottom line: As long as you hold tightly the reins on your expectations, this place is a 4 star or better, depending on what's important to you."}
{"text":"I was practically screamed at they have such great service and friendly staff. The end.   Food is over priced. It is higher quality but the techniques they employ are not. Most noodle chefs are known for knowing how long each item added to the dish needs to cook in order for the noodle dish to not be a hot mess. They really air on the side of caution. All my ingredients are at the bottom of the bin with the noodles in a wad on top. They were cooked completely separate. Well, my onions and green onions are raw so maybe they just weren't cooked st all. The shrimp are scampi and over cooked. Otherwise it could have been good. But it's really lacking in any flavor.   I was exited to try this place first but now that I have I'm not impressed and probably won't be giving this place another shot."}
{"text":"Tried calling an order in ahead of time... Got a \"message inbox full\" message 3 times. Ordered 2 entrees (kung pao chicken and crispy ckicken) to-go. The cashier ignored me for about 5 minutes while she took a phone order (the phones do work! I confirmed that the number I tried was accurate). They had a 'tip field' on the receipt... That bugs me at a take-out/semi-fast food type place. Food came out quick. Food was decent."}
{"text":"Great concept guys, but both times we have been there all of our family members have been ill  for 24 hours afterwards. The food tasted good, but its just not worth the pain. I suggest the owners look into the cleanliness of the kitchens or the quality of the prep areas as its far more than coincidence that this happened to all of us on two separate occasions several months apart."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE me some Wok Box! I try to go here at least once a week. The food is fantastic and the staff is so friendly. Rebekah, the lead cook is amazing. She already knows my go-to meal. Dan Dan bowl with udon noodles and tofu! The owners wife is a delight. I just love everything about this place. As does my family of 3 :) I would highly recommend everyone to stop by for lunch or dinner. (Psst, left overs are delicious the next day!)"}
{"text":"Try the Butter Chicken! You'll love it. Fun menu. Excellent service. I've tried many dishes but keep coming back to the butter chicken. The quality of the food is high"}
{"text":"This location is a hit or miss however, I've had far more misses than hits. So I won't be returning. One recommendation, get a solid group of employees. The turnover rate is HIGH. The past year I've only seen one person there consistently. The food is just alright and I get \"fresh to order\" however one cook during busy times and you can expect to wait about 15-20 minutes. (not ideal for mall employees with a half hour lunch.)   The worst experience was today. I ordered beef & broccoli, it wasn't busy, there was no one else there and plenty of employees. I got my meal and took it to my table and the beef was RAW. Not safe. Not good. The broccoli was hard and raw not even cooked. After waiting 10 minutes I figured it would be well done. I didn't have another 10 minutes to wait for them to make me a new one as I was on lunch so I got a refund. Check your meal at this location!"}
{"text":"Different, fast, and good  Was in the area with my wife and girls and we came upon Wok Box. Decided to give it a go for lunch.   The vibe is a cross between Noodles & Co. and a Pei Wei. The staff was nice and quick with our order. The restaurant was clean, bright, and appealing. And the value for the meal per person was good.   Everyone liked their meals-- Dan Dan with Steak, Firecraker with Tofu, and two kids meals. Almost all was gone. The gyoza was more vegetable than anything, so would recommend passing on those. Other than that, fun, fast, and a good bite to eat!"}
{"text":"I reserved judgment until my second visit. It's just not good.   Today I ordered the kung pao noodle bowl with tofu. When they called my number, they had made it with chicken. I told them about the mistake and they re-made the dish. When I got it back it was mostly cold and just did not have good flavor. The way they slice their vegetables doesn't really make sense. The slices of red and green bell peppers were huge. It didn't taste fresh, and there was no depth of flavor, just a lot of sweet sauce. Nowhere close to real kung pao. The Lipton tea they have tastes very processed, and not \"fresh brewed\" as it is labeled."}
{"text":"My family and I normally love to eat here and the food is good, but today I was so OFFENDED by the cashier, Rebekah that I will probably NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!!!!!!  We had 4 adults and 1 child in our party, my child was already sitting at a table while I ordered.  The cashier rudely asked if I had a child when I ordered a kids meal, then she gave some lame excuse, and attempted to move on when I corrected her for her unprofessional comment!!!!    4-5 stars for the food, but no stars for Rebekah and her manager if she was told to humiliate their patrons!!!!"}
{"text":"I went with the Kung Pao Chicken today. It was not even close to a spicy dish. I literally couldn't find anything resembling pepper flake. The fresh veggies are nice. But it is far from what I would expect. The other dishes at the table didn't look all that spectacular. My girlfriend didn't eat much of her dish. The lady working out front was very helpful and offered to replace my girlfriend's dish. They get high marks for service but the food just isn't that great."}
{"text":"This place is good. We ordered shanghai noodles with chicken and tofu, Indian butter chicken, & kids meal. I like the thick noodles & it was spicy!!! The Indian butter chicken was smooth, curry yumm taste. I like the fact that they made a kids meal plain brown rice and grilled chicken. What I didn't like, their Vietnamese coffee...yuk. When user said \"it was to die for\", you've got to be kidding me?!?! I consider myself a connoisseur of Vietnamese coffee and that ain't it!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed.   Wanted to like this place - really did. Nice eclectic menu with some Indian mixed with Thai and other Asian influences.  Went last weekend with my daughter - she got the Mongolian Noodles (with Tofu) and I got the Red Curry Chicken. The owner or manager seemed to go out of how way to helpfully explain the menu choices and how ordering worked (choice of noodles).   All in all both dishes were DROWNING in sauce - really a soupy gloppy mess of too sweet sauce that vastly overpowered the chicken (which was tender but seemed pre-made and simply added fast food style to the bean sprouts and other ingredients).   This is certainly fast food fusion - nothing special at all about what we had.   2 dishes cost $20 or so - and I could get the same at a REAL Chinese or Thai place and get some REAL tasting food with actual fresh food that isn't simply about throwing some pre-made stuff into a wok and calling it good.  The food here isn't bad mind you - but is isn't very good either - very average. Certainly not worth $20 (although someone in front of us had a Groupon and that would have been a better way to fly).  My teen daughter and I agreed - food rates about a 6 out of 10. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Quick easy take-out! That's why I love wok box.  Their menu is simple and of course the take out in the cute boxes always is great!"}
{"text":"First off, let me say that another reviewers assertion that you're better off going to Panda Express is, in my eyes, way off base. Maybe I've been to the wrong Panda??  I'm super happy about this addition to the area. It's exactly what the area needed - a tasty, healthy, fast Asian food option. I got the Firecracker noodle bowl with chicken, and it was very good. I have to admit that I was mostly curious because of the \"bacon\" aspect, and it wasn't all that prevalent in the dish, but there was plenty of chicken, noodles, and veggies and it was all very good. Spicy-wise, it had a little bit of kick, but not overwhelming. It's nowhere close to \"Thai spicy.\"  All in all I'll surely be back to try something else. It was a good amount of food, and I wasn't leaving with a greasy gut-bomb feeling that was going to put me in a food coma going back to work."}
{"text":"Wow!! This was even better than I thought. I got the Thai salad and it was exactly what I needed with all the freshness. Also Santos was phenomenal as friendly."}
{"text":"I actually don't mind the flavors from wok box. But the ingredients seem somewhat substandard in quality.  But the real reason I gave this two stars was due to at least half my experiences being substandard.  Twice I asked for a certain noodle they regularly offer but both timed my request was forgotten.   About half turn time I get employees who clearly don't enjoy working there and/or don't really know what they are fling when it comes to anything resembling customer service"}
{"text":"Thank you for going out of business and sticking me with a bunch of unusable gift cards"}
{"text":"Meh about sums it up. I was hoping for a decent quick lunch and was craving some Asian flavor so I figured I would give it a try. Had orange chicken and some spring rolls. Orange chicken was kind of generic and blah on white rice. The spring rolls tasted like freezer section rolls you get at the supermarket.  Probably will not eat there again."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, I had the beef with cashews and it was delicious!!...they offer a nice variety of Asian food, that  I would like to go back there soon to try them..   Even when they are a franchise, I must say they are very good!!..."}
{"text":"Not very good. 25 min wait for what should be somewhat fast food. The flavors were not very good on any of the 4 items we had. I'd suggest they reevaluate the menu and then figure out how to be more efficient. People will forgive slow service for good food, but this place is a bust on all fronts."}
{"text":"Had pad thai for lunch two days in a row. Yesterday at Pei Wei in Chandler and today here. Pei Wei's wins hands down. Their shrimps are bigger and fresher, more roasted chopped peanuts, more bean sprouts. The hubby had dandan noodles and said Pei Wei's is much better, too. There's no difference between their \"regular\" and \"small\" noodle bowls, neither is good for sharing. The two stars are for the Vietnamese iced coffee and the fiery  cheese balls. Pricing? You'll do much better in a hole in the wall asian resto. Would I recommend this to friends? Maybe, just to satisfy their curiosity. And, for the coffee."}
{"text":"Three stars because the food was tasty and tables clean - also, I 1) found parking and 2) got back on my way in what is typically a nightmare traffic zone.   The Pad Thai tasted good but there were maybe (!) 4 pieces of chicken and the vegetables were so slivered and so few (except for a few onions) they were nearly nonexistent. 99% noodles.... Really? For $10+? I may give one more try, but this was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Spicy DanDan noodles are my favorite. Samosa are NOT good, do not order them. Way too much flour & potato filling does not have much flavor. Besides the samosas, place is clean, friendly employees & dandan is perfect."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm pretty impressed. My first visit to a Wok Box was a couple years ago in Toronto and I was very disappointed. This store has changed my opinion.  I ordered the cashew chicken to go. The employee taking my order was very knowledgeable and answered my questions with ease. The food was really good for a fast food venue. My only complaint was how long it took to make everything, though I appreciate that everything is made fresh to order."}
{"text":"I had the dan dan chicken bowl. Which was super spicy, and I added some siracha and soy sauce. It was delicious and well cooked. The place was very clean as well."}
{"text":"Originally was going to paradise bakery and decided to stop by here instead. Boy did I regret it! It took 20 minutes to get my food. If you are in a hurry avoid this place."}
{"text":"I love their gluten-free salads.  You can pick and choose your ingredients and they're very considerate if somebody has food sensitivities.  It's a great place!!"}
{"text":"I've always found the food to be very fresh. Read the menu carefully and order what sounds good. My kids love the Terriyaki chicken. Have not had a horrible dish but certainly prefer some dishes over others. I definitely recommend anyone give it a try. I like that the veggies are fresh and crisp. Staff is always helpful and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not great. We both enjoyed our meals and would eat here again unless there was an option I knew I liked better."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Horrible service. Don't waste your time or money. You're better off at Panda Express"}
{"text":"I love indian food, and although it's not totally authentic with the spicing the butter chicken here is my favorite I've ever had. The chicken is lean and cooked perfect and the naan bread is fresh and warm.   I've tried other things from the menu as well and everything has been great."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place!! I really do! We've tried it multiple times. The service is great, the restaurant is clean, the food is just okay. All of the dishes just seem to kind of taste the same to me. It could also be a matter of preference, my husband does like it. My biggest complaint is it's really pricey for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I've had most of the menu now, but won't be going back anymore.  The ingredients appear great, and taste really good, it's just unfortunate they do not cook things enough to make them hot.  The past couple times I've been there my dinner was barely luke warm."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Tried a few different items. They are all good but nothing exceptional. Plus I feel some of the dishes portion sizes could be a little larger. It seems to be a little inconsistent from time to time. But I will be back to try some other new things."}
{"text":"I like many others had purchased a Groupon for two dinners. I stopped in yesterday around lunch time. I was greeted by a friendly smile behind the counter at the pickup window. Since I had never been here before I told the young man I had a Groupon and he explained to me how it worked etc. There were several people standing around waiting for their food and just a few in the restaurant eating.  I asked the young woman taking the orders what was good and she recommended the Cashew Chicken and also a Chicken /Curry dish. So I went with those two choices as well as a Black berry/ Jasmin Green Tea. My dinners were ready to go in about 5 minutes.  Everything was delicious! Including the Blackberry tea! It was so refreshing on a hot day and went so well with the meal. I can't wait to try Wok Box again soon."}
{"text":"We used to come here about once a week it was so friendly and just good food. But the last month it has changed so much it's horrible. The menu is different so people in front of you take forever to order. The girl at the register is awful and needs to learn customer service. We will not come back we can get the same food some where else."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time.  Not bad by fast food standards.  The chicken lemongrass rice box was generously portioned with lots of chicken and veg.  The sauce was a good accompaniment and not overly spiced.  All in all a decently solid effort and something different then the every day."}
{"text":"Great butter chicken! Great location and very clean. Plus the suns game was on. Love this place"}
{"text":"The verdict is still out of this one. We went earlier this month because I'm always excited to see a new restaurant close to home.  Upon walking in we were greeted by delicious smells and a large menu. We were pretty impressed with the wide variety of options from several different cultures. Looking at the menu alone we were already planning our next trip back.   Unfortunately, that's where it took a turn. My husband's food came up in a reasonable amount of time, when he grabbed his bowl he informed the young kid handing orders out that there was another bowl in our order. They assured us it was coming up. I'm never a fan of parts of an order coming up a different times but it's a more casual place so I figured that's fine it'll be next.   Wrong, 5 minutes past and they handed out the order after us, so we again mentioned waiting for part of our order. They again assured us it would be right up. Another 5 minutes past and the next order came up but still not mine so we go back to the kid who honestly just looks dumbfounded at this point and shrugs his shoulders.   After standing and watching him for a couple minutes to see if  he was doing anything about this (he didn't) we got back in line to talk to the person at the register. It turns out they weren't even making my food so I had to wait for them to start from scratch.   All in all I ate about 20 minutes after my husband who finally had to eat his because it was going cold.  The food itself was good, not the best we've had but a nice average I'd eat again. My husband had the Dan Dan which we found disappointing in spice and flavor, so if we come back we'll definitely try something else. I had the Singapore Cashew that we liked a lot better.  After looking on their website I found it hilarious they brag about having a \"Triple 7 pledge\" that offers a voucher if your food doesn't come up within 7 minutes (let alone 20 min). Guess they didn't have time to give that out either."}
{"text":"Ate here for first time. My wife's parents owned a Chinese take out restaurant so speaking from that perspective. This place is just OK. Nothing special and over priced. I ordered extra protein (sumo protein) and did not appear I got much more. Also there was a plastic twisty in my food. They were apologetic and gave me a $10 gift certificate but won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been a regular since Wok Box opened this location. The food quality was good when it opened. Now, not so much.   I've tried several items on the menu and at this point, I'd rather have Panda Express if I'm looking for a fast food option. The meats taste low grade. The orange chicken is flavorless. The Indian butter chicken has way too much sauce.  Today was the final straw. The white rice in my takeout order was so overcooked, it was like eating mashed potatoes.   Will not be back here again unless they can get their food quality in order."}
{"text":"Not really a fan. The mongolian beef was blah.  The meat was tough and some parts were crunchy.  The meat is very cheap quality.  Definitely not the same meat that's pictured on their display.  The rice was a bit raw in some of my bites. And overall they drowned my rice in the sauce.  I forced myself to eat half of it.  It's also pretty expensive.  $12 for my rice bowl, soda and 2 small eggrolls.  I would not come back again."}
