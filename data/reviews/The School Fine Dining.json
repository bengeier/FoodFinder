{"text":"The food is fantastic, albeit pricey. If you want great food (taste, portion size) and classy venue then this is the perfect choice."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a wonderful dinner with our friends recently and the food and service were impeccable. I am planning a return visit for our upcoming anniversary."}
{"text":"Wonderful service.  Elegant setting.  The bone in filet is second to none. This is a special spot a must try.  Get the ceaser salad for two.  Made fresh table side!! Martin."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Ordered the calamari to start ($13). The pieces were big but the batter was terrible bc I could taste the flour. 
For the main I had the rare yellowfin tuna ($25). It was not fresh and had my stomach in knots after. :(
A few people at the other table ordered the French onion soup which looked deelish and I wish I got that instead. 
I came here twice in the past and I feel like it went from an A to a B to now a C minus. It is called the school after all."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty solid for the area but you could certainly do better downtown for the same price. Total $75-100 per person."}
{"text":"Overall, the food is fine but the New York Steak does not taste as good as it supposed to be for the same price. The atmosphere in general is good and romantic."}
{"text":"My husband made reservations for valintine's dinner and I was feeling a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews.
Our reservation was for 8 o'clock, when we arrived the restaurant was extremely busy but we were seated right away.
Where to start?
Due to the day there was a set menu but with a great selection , we both ordered the Caesar salad and it was thee best I have ever had (apparently they make them table side every day but holidays, I'll be back for that lol)
Next was the surf and turf. ....mouth watering, cooked to perfection! My husband ordered medium rare and I ordered pittsburgh med .
As for desert you can't go wrong with a desert trolley lol I wanted to try them all,but ordered the cheese cake ...Omg move over cheese cake factory you've been out done by far!
The service was warm and professional, classy but not pretentious .
Restaurants with this kind of standard just don't exist anymore :(
Kudos to the school!!!!

It's unfortunate that this restaurant got bad reviews but sometimes you have to consider the source, clearly for the reviews there are people who have NO CLUE about fine dining! !!"}
{"text":"Lovely aristocratic interior and great service but their steak was a huge disappointment. I ordered the filet mignon and it came looking like a home cooked meal... On my plate had the steak, a plain baked potato, and ONE of each of a strip of pepper, carrot and bok choy.  Please refer to my picture.

For \"fine dining\" I just can't believe that is what came out of the kitchen. The sear was a bit too strong and it was not really medium rare as asked for, and I saw another person's steak they asked for medium and it looked more rare than mine etc.. 

I also had the lobster bisque which was nice how it came with big lobster chunks but I think their soup base is mixed with tomato cream soup a bit too much. Creme brûlée cheesecake was quite neat though."}
{"text":"Team Xmas dinner
Salad appetizers pear and arugula (partner), as well as my beet, mixed greens and goat cheese were delicious. 
The multiple portions of toasted garlic bread was devoured and was almost the star of the show, served along with small bowls of pickled olives, gerkhins and button mushrooms.
I had the special 12 oz bone in filet with veg and baked potato. Cooked to med rare properly. Although delicious it did not achieve the level of excellence that my wife enjoyed having ordered the rack of lamb. Cooked and spiced to perfection, plenty to eat.
Desserts delicious I had the pecan pie.
Caeser salad prepared from scratch table side, don't see that very often.
The best part of the entire evening was the attentive service by our waiters who did not miss anything.
Would definitely recommend to those looking for that genuine steak and seafood fine dining experience.
Even the mens room was well appointed and clean."}
{"text":"Friends popped into town last minute so we had to find somewhere close to them, so I googled fine dining in the area and I'm so glad this came up. Started with drinks and apps in the bar which is an original school house (really cool). When we moved into the dining area they had a pianist and it gave a really elegant and relaxing atmosphere along with the fireplace. We ordered the table side caeser salad to start and it was really well done and  also entertaining to watch. I ordered the lobster risotto and let me tell you I was in heaven. My friends ordered the chateau brijon and it was cooked to perfection with all the fixings. We will definitely be coming back. The food and service was very satisfying, hopefully my boss will agree and bring us for Xmas lol"}
{"text":"This is a fine dining restaurant so don't expect to spend anything less than $50 -$100/person.  We ordered a bottle of white wine which was $40, calamari and escargot to start and proceeded with entrees and dessert with coffee to finish.

The appetizers were quite good; the calimari was lightly breaded had a great cripsy texture and the squid itself was perfectly cooked.  The escargot was cooked in garlic and butter; was an okay dish nothing special.

For mains my mom had the seafood platter which was $75 and came with a perfectly cooked lobster tail, prawns, scallops, as well as a variety of other seafood.  My dad had the prime rib ($35) which came with veggies and baked potato as well as a bun, and horseradish. 

My sister had the top sirloin and I had the seafood linguine.  I thought the seafood linguine was a bit on the salty side but it came with two large scallops, prawns, squid and more.

For dessert we had the creme Brule, cheesecake and tiramisu ($8-9 each).  The creme brule was delicious, by far our favourite of the three, the cheesecake was typical and the tiramisu was subpar.

Overall we had a good experience here some pros and cons.  It was pricey but it made mothers day extra special.  The service was top notch and our server was absolutely great."}
{"text":"Another \"fine dining\" steakhouse that is located in some old-architecture building with old waiters dressed in penguin suits. Can never differentiate these places amongst the David Duncans and Octagons, but my time here was great. Nothing really to complain about.

I came here with a group of 15 - family from out of town came to visit and I decided to take all of them out here to try something new. You get your steaks, fish, freshly prepared table-side Ceasar salad. All quite delicious.

The building itself is quite interesting - as the name of the restaurant suggests, it used to be a school.

Wouldn't come out of my way to eat here, but it is pretty neat to eat at an old school, so if you're ever feeling like a different ambiance, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"We came here for our Christmas work lunch. Reservations need to be made for the Christmas season at least a month in advance, as all the tables were completely full. The decor was very lovely and classy.

We ordered a bunch of appetizers. Grilled calamari was good, but not that much quantity-wise. Fried calamari was great, probably my favourite appetizer. The escargot was so-so, but not really worth it, as there were only about 10 pieces and it didn't really stand out. The crab cakes were great, even though there were only 2 crab cakes. Lobster bisque soup was good, but a little too salty and a little too thick. The smoked salmon was as you would expect it, nothing special.

I had the filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly to medium rare. I was a little disappointed at how small it was, especially when I saw that my coworkers filet mignon was noticeably bigger than mine. It came with a baked potato and a few pieces of veggies on the side. I also tried some of the yellow fin tuna, which was also delicious.

For dessert, I had a carrot cake and it was delicious but very heavy."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is the finest upscale dining room in Markham.  I find the management, waiters, and food great.  When you come back they remember you.   Open for lunch and dinner, and they also have good 'meeting' space for weddings and corporate events along with a very nice bar area.  My favorite foods are Calamari lightly dusted pan fried, French onion soup, Lobster Bisque, wedge with blue cheese, beef medallions, peppercorn steak flamed at the table, salsbury steak, and baked chicken supreme.  Kinda pricey but you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"My dad has always wanted to dine here so we finally got the chance for his birthday and it exceeded our expectations ! Our fine dining experience started with beef carpaccio and tuna sashimi (great flavours for both) as appetizers. We had the seafood casserole (shrimps, scallops etc.) and steak with sweet potato fries and onion rings as sides. Everything was cooked perfectly and the service was also great! It was a delightful treat and I'm looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Very good lobster bisque... The garlic bread is quite delicious too! The price is quite pricey as the main entrees yet nothing too special. As for the dessert...just regular cheesecakes....would be better if they had their own special"}
{"text":"Whenever our family is in the mood for non-Asian food in the North Scarborough/Markham/Richmond Hill area, we often end up at the School Fine Dining.  Located in a great venue...I guess it might have been an old school house, but more likely just a grand old residence, it has the regular meat and seafood dishes presented in an up scale manner.  Fine old school dining at the School Fine Dining!"}
{"text":"Very nice upscale restaurant for a client meeting or romantic dinner. The scallop rissotto was very good...had 5 large scallops. Lobster rissotto was also very good with large chunks of lobster that was cooked just right (not overcooked...meat was still juicy and flaky as you chewed into it). Had the lobster bisque to start and I wish it wasn't so salty. The crab cakes were very good with a lot of real crab meat. The Japanese pickled ginger (the one you get at sushi places) didn't go well with the crabcakes but was offered on the side of the plate."}
{"text":"Went today to the school, had the filet mignon 6oz, asked for medium, came in burnt on top and well done inside. Seems like it was made the day before. Ordered lentil soup, very tasteless and no seasoning my guess. Asked for bread when lunch was served and received none. Ordered coffee and coffee was given to me across the table? Is this fine dinning?  Very disappointed and not recommended. I was looking forward to this place. Pricy but felt like 3 star hotel dinning level. If you want to pay good money and service, try somewhere else"}
{"text":"Their creme brûlée cheesecake is awesome! It doesn't taste too cheesy and the texture is just right. Its mixed with vanilla and you can see the vanilla as black little dots in the dessert. Also it's the type of cake that doesn't come with the biscuit crumbs in side. Would come back again just for this!"}
{"text":"I go every weekend...love the place as it's close to me and it's the best upscale restaurant in Markham.  We went to a wedding there and it was first class in their special rooms.  Can be a bit pricey especially for booze, but you can't beat the food ... from lobster soup, onion soup, wonderful garlic bread, table flamed pepper steak, dusted calamari wonderful appetizer, chicken supreme is great meal, friendly and efficient servers, free parking, and more.  Not wild about their deserts but still have them to satisfy my sweet tooth.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Went here last night for my birthday for the first time.  It was with my husband and my three lovely daughters.  

Atmosphere:
It was a quiet night. There was two sets of couples seated. We arrived at 6:30pm and was seated nicely in the corner.  The place is nice, clean but a the decor was a little dated.

Service:
The servers were nice, but stuck around close to our table a little more than we were comfortable with prior to ordering.  My youngest was 22 months, so you can imagine it took a bit more time.  The server refilled our water when needed and provided us with second basket of starter garlic bread.

Food:

-French onion soups ($9), it was so-so.  The flavor lacked and very little was found in the soup. My family are cheese fans so it was thank goodness there was an abundance of that to compensate.  
-The seafood platter ($75)  was 50/50.  The lobster tail was cooked nicely but the rest was mediocre.  The vegetables was blan.
- Chicken penne w/balsamic sauce (cant remember the price and exact name).  This was funny tasting.  The cream sauce has a slight burnt taste to it.
- Garoupa with lemon and pepper ( catch of the day $38).  The fist was cooked nicely but had NO flavor to it.  I literally utilized every drop of the lemon to give it some flavor.  The vegetable was blan and the rice was gross.
- The best thing we had that night was probably the free garlic bread and pickled dish of veggies.

The bill came up to $250 with tax and tips.  We have paid more for 2-person dinner at other places, and did feel like it was a good experience to justify the price.  Unfortunately, This was one expensive fine dining experience not worth the price tag."}
{"text":"Old school mansion decor type of restaurant, similar to David Duncan House. The environment was quiet and dim. I would rate this place a 2.5 if I could.

The service was pretty good here but the quality of food was lacking for a fine dining experience. I ordered the scallops which came on a bed of risotto and the risotto was hard and starchy, I didn't send it back because I was full from the scallops and veggies but when the server asked about it, I told him straight up the risotto was terribly hard and he kind of just acknowledged it but didn't do anything about it. There's many restaurants in Toronto that will waive items off the bill if you were really unsatisfied. Not that I was expecting it but a small discount or something would have been a nice gesture. The hot water also came with a stained looking cup and it tasted so off that I ended up ordering a bottle of sparkling instead. There's plenty of staff, and they were quite nice though. And the complimentary garlic bread was great. Probably won't be returning just because there's better restaurants for the price."}
{"text":"Reservations recommended for Saturday night.

Garlic bread - quite oily and inconsistently baked (some pieces were burnt).  Some pieces were quite good though.

Lamb chops - tender, soft, and flavourful.  It was really well prepared.

Steak - average, was quite tender but a bit plain.

Pianist playing to compliment your fine dining."}
{"text":"I have always heard so many great things about this place. Mostly that it is high-end, fancy, expensive, and bring your girl there for a special occasion.

Well, they were right about one thing, IT'S EXPENSIVE. They serve higher end quality products, not a single one was cooked close to perfection. Their menu is very classic, flavours were dull and plain, textures were off, meats not aged properly, plating lacked creativity and colour, ingredient pairing for dishes were horrible. If you're into living in the past, and have a shitload of money to spend, you may want to come check this place out. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and don't eat here. Your taste buds will thank me, your wallet will thank me.

Service-wise, we were served by an older gentleman who's hands were shaky. Every time he would bring a dish over, it felt like he was about to drop it. You can tell from his attitude that he didn't like his job at all. We never really talked to him much, seeing his negative attitude. But if your staff aren't even proud to be working here, how can your customers trust the food coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Had their seafood pasta linguini and absolutely loved it! Great in taste and had plenty of fresh seafood served with it. Steak was also cooked to perfection and was seasoned really nicely.
Service was very accommodating and it was a very nice place to have had my birthday dinner or a future romantic date!"}
{"text":"Upscale fine dining that one of a kind in Markham.  The last time I came here was more than a decade ago, and much of which hasn't really changed.  Serving the finest dishes that are carefully prepared with quality with top class service The School has always preserved it's fine dining rapport.
It's Victorian inspired interior, dimmed lights and spacious interior gives off not only a classy, but feeling of warmth and comfort.
With its spacious dining room, this venue also has a separate bar room where you can host a small party without disrupting dining patrons. 
Their prices are, to no surprise is.....well..no surprise but again it's the quality and experience that's truly one of a kind."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great and the decor takes you away from the ordinary restaurants. The server is very polite and the dining experience is elaborated. The menu has a great variety of fine dining and the tuna I asked lived to the expectations. It is a good place to go for an especial occasion or a business meeting."}
{"text":"We returned to the School to celebrate a special anniversary (we had our first official date at this restaurant!) and I was not disappointed. Although not especially hungry, the food was on point. The escargot is always a treat and love their Caesar salad. I also had the grilled calamari - I had not had it like that before and It was the perfect amount for a main for me. My hubby to be had a beautifully prepared strip steak cooked to a delicate medium rare. I splurged and had carrot cake - not my usual choice but no crème brulee on the menu."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday.  The atmosphere was very elegant and service was top notch.  We had the chateaubriand, it was delicious!  I would definitely recommend for special occasions."}
{"text":"No complaints.

Simple but nice decor, great service.
Steak was perfect."}
{"text":"I went recently for a private function so my experience may be a bit different from what happens in the dining room.

The food was ok - but just nothing very special.  The passed appetizers were literally M&M meats from apps - meatballs in BBQ sauce, bacon wrapped scallops, spring rolls, breaded cheese puffs.  You get the idea.

The entree I had was NY strip with a side of roasted potatoes and julienned veggies (i think carrots and peppers, it was really just salty strips of colour without much other flavour).  Steak was cooked medium rare on the inside as I asked, but somehow the outside was charred black.  Not really sure how they managed to do it but they did.

I feel that if I received this food at someone's house I would think - \"huh, its good, but i guess these people don't really like to cook.\"  Having this food at what is considered to be a fine dinning restaurant is pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"I have always heard good things about The School but I still have never tried this place (not even today lol). I was researching about wedding venues, and came across The School. There were minimal info on their website about wedding events, so we've decided to drop by and inquire. It is located on 14th Avenue (Between Kennedy/Warden) in Markham. The restaurant is like shaped like a mansion on the outside! It must look beautiful during the summer, I thought :)

We were greeted by a lady at coat check area when we walked in. She then went to get Chris, I believe would be the restaurant manager. Chris was courteous and helpful. Unfortunately, we found out that their venue can only accommodate up to max 140 people, and we were aiming for 250-300. I guess it would make a great place for a small engagement party or a cozy wedding reception!

Bummer. I'm always a fan of top notch food combined with old school styled service. I thought this would be the perfect wedding venue! And so, the search continues on. 3 stars for now (mid-point). I'll definitely be back to try this restaurant very soon. Gotta take my brother here for his bday dinner... and I will update my rating for this place!"}
{"text":"If you don't want to drive downtown but still have a decent fine dining experience, this place will do. The environment classic and elegant. As the name suggests, you can tell the building use to be a school. My brother-in-law's steak also came out burned. As in, the outside was black. We explained to our server this was inedible, so he apologized and promptly brought a new one that was okay. 

There is nothing wrong with this place, service or food, but the quality of the food does not compare to similar cuisines downtown. Because of this, the menu is slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"Great service and beautiful ambience. If you're looking to celebrate a special occasion or impress business partners in Markham, the School Fine Dining is a great place.

What I've had:
- Creamy lobster bisque w/ cognac
- Bacon wrapped filet mignon
- Peppercorn steak

Highly recommend the bisque and peppercorn steak. The Peppercorn steak is flamed with cognac and they sear the steak right next to your table. So hey, you get a bit of a show going on. Couldn't get enough of the steak sauce!

Some more comments:
- Appetizers are yummy. Love the pickled assortment with mushrooms. 
- We were given a free Chocolate cake for my bf's birthday. So sweet of them. Cake was perfect."}
{"text":"Service is excellent and the setting is a refreshing change from the abundance of strip mall so called restaurants in the 905.
But be warned, their name should be 'Old School' like their cuisine.
Food is good quality but serving size is large and heavy in substance. 
I ordered Yellowfin Tuna and it was sliced an inch thick!
A lighter meal option would of been nice to see on their menu.
Wouldn't rush back-more for the 50 + age group"}
{"text":"Excellent food for good fine dining prices. Came here for lunch and the service was professional and friendly; atmosphere was elegant and easy. Steaks were beautifully done and the lobster bisque was delicious. An excellent fine dining choice in Markham."}
{"text":"Amazing Food.  Best Ceasar Salad for two that they do right at the Table.  Awesome Pepper Steak ...  Service is very good"}
{"text":"We came here for a business dinner as was hosting some prospective clients.  The building is historical and beautiful which was the primary reason for is selecting this restaurant.  The staff are extremely attentive and service was excellent.  It's a bit pricey here and that's ok however did not see the value.  The steak was good however a Keg steak is much better for better value.  One of our guests had the seafood linguine which she thoroughly enjoyed.  The Garlic bread served warm on the table is addictive along with their pickled vegetables.  A great looking restaurant however not sure if it is worth the premium."}
