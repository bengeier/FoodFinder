{"text":"I've been a regular here for quite some time now, I cannot complain about much. Service is great, staff is very attentive, restaurant is clean, good food etc. I love that they remodeled, but am not too happy that my favorite salad & a few other things are off the menu. If they brought back the salad I'd come by for lunch more often, now it'll be a once in an every great while thing."}
{"text":"This is great place to stop and eat after shopping! Me and friend and I had the steak frites and it was very enjoyable! Our server was very attentive and did a great job! There is no doubt that I will return very soon."}
{"text":"Such a nice place to relax after a hard day of shopping! Here I had the best turkey and avocado sandwich that I've ever had. Super flavorful and always leaves me full and content. The fries are good as well except I wish that there were more sauce options. I also really enjoy the mac and cheese.The only thing that puzzles me about this place is how many of the menu items have so many calories!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was AMAZING-her name was Ashley. She was so so friendly, offered suggestions, and was fun! The food came out super fast as well and I was surprised at the vast menu options. Salads were clearly the way to go, we were jealous as we saw them passing by, next time that's what I'll go for! Sandwiches/burgers were all delicious but fries were a little over cooked and crispy. Desserts weren't anything to write home about-which made me sad cause I was hoping to have a worthy diet cheat! We were surprised at the quality for a mall restaurant and the best part is you can use your Nordstrom gift card in the restaurant. Food over clothes lol"}
{"text":"good service, decent food but waaaay overpriced for what they actually serve and the portions arent that big. salmon was sweet, pasta was underwhelming, crab bisque wasnt bad but crab mac and cheese was overwhelming"}
{"text":"This is a nice refreshing restaurant where I had really good service from the server. I got the chicken ceassr salad which was delicious. The lettuce was fresh and crisp and the dressing was perfect. The rolls could be better though. For dessert I had the paradise chocolate cake which is nothing to write  home about. If you get it I would drizzle the carmel over the top. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Quiet! A great place to eat an egg, bacon, and potato breakfast. Just ask you can get mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, and other vegetables. One of the best breakfast in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much, for so many reasons. First, they have recently upgraded the food and cocktail, which are worthy of the best restaurants in town. Every dish I've tried has been delicious, often organic, sizable, and fresh. The personable bartender prepares delicious craft cocktails, and sitting at the bar is a fun experience. Again, worthy of the best bars in town. And let's not even talk about Nordstrom's legendary service. It permeates the Grille.  I love to come here with friends, family, or just alone, anytime of day. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Good restaurant. Ordered a salmon salad and it was a little dry but the service is great."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several Nordstrom Cafe's and while some are quite good, this one was a bit lackluster. The service was prompt and our server Chaun was relatively attentive to the soy allergy in our group. Unfortunately the food wasn't up to par. The salmon in the salmon salad was dry, over cooked and salty. The rest of the food was average. I would try it again the next time I'm in Cleveland but I won't be going out of my way to eat at Nordstrom's Grill."}
{"text":"Updated bar area, tweaks/upgrades to the menu, great food and service!  Fantastic alternative to the food court."}
{"text":"Today we had the best service ever for a large group.  Our waiter, Tony, was pleasant, thorough and professional.  Seventeen ladies arrived. Tony helped to push tables together, and handed out all menus on time.  He was organized taking all orders.  He knew which salad each of us had (we all had salads)!!  The menu had good selections, house wines, and cocktails from the bar.  The salads were large and delicious.  The rolls were chewy, and nice with the salad.  I had the Asian chicken salad.  It included an adequate amount of grilled chicken with an Asian sauce.  Lots of salad goodies and crunchies were found among the lettuce.  It was served with two bread sticks that looked like chopsticks.  Found on the third floor."}
