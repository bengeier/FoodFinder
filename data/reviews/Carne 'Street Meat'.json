{"text":"Automatically when someone says \"street meat\", I think hot dogs. Well, you're in for a surprise because you won't get hot dogs here. Instead, it'll be savoury sandwiches.  A friend and I were really hoping to try the breaded eggplant but it was sold out :( Back up plan, I got the rotisserie chicken (avocado, tomato, and lemon aioli on ciabatta) and my friend got the porchetta (arugula and salsa verde on ciabatta) and we traded our halfsies.  Luckily we snagged a spot at one of the bistro tables overlooking Olympic plaza, and enjoyed our sandwiches in the sun while we had a quick visit.  Seriously, both sandwiches were really tasty, I don't think I could choose one over the other.  If you're ever wandering past Olympic plaza around lunch, swing by Carne. Maybe get the eggplant sandwich and let me know how it is :)"}

{"text":"So if you haven't been here yet you really should head down. The food is fantastic, prices are great, and the staff is friendly yet professional. I took my daughter down there once and then ate there again when I was with my other daughters class on a field trip. Both times have been well worth it!    So stop reading this and get your ass down there, no really, now!"}
{"text":"Mediocre pre-made meats from who knows when.  I've eaten here before during events at olympic plaza, and the linups are huge, the meat sammich's are unsatisfyingly expensive.   Its like eating at the JoJo's foodtruck for bbq when you've have BBQ at Llano, Texas - such a letdown.  There are so many places that do street meat better.  The smoked meat place in the NE orders its smoked meat from Schwarttz in montreal, where they make the smoke meat at the mosst famous deli for montreal smoked meat."}
{"text":"This is another solid sandwich place in Calgary. I think maybe my standards for sandwiches are higher than food types, for some reason, but all-in-all this place offers are great experience for a down-town quick lunch.   Now, I have been wanting to try this place for a long time as my co-worker regularly gets the grilled cheese on a cold day and raves about it. However, it's not hard to get a grilled cheese right. So, the other day I finally had time and a sandwich craving so I wondered over for lunch.   This place doesn't actually make the sandwiches. They are pre-made in the morning (I hope) and then brought over. When you order, they warm them up on the press, but since they are pre-made there is no way to get any sandwich different than what is offered on the menu. Therefore, if you have any kind of allergy this is probably not the best place for you.   I ordered the smoked meat sandwich and my friend ordered the prosciutto. My sandwich was warm on the outside and frozen on the inside. I suppose this was because it was towards the end of the day and they had already started to put the sandwiches in the freezer to preserve them? I'm not sure but either way it wasn't pleasant. I showed it to the employees and they quickly rectified the situation. I had a new sandwich (not frozen) in less than 5 minutes. It would have been frustrating, though, had I chosen to walk back to the office and then discovered that my sandwich was inedible. I guess I was lucky that it was a nice enough day to pause and eat outside.  Anyway, the second sandwich was quite good. The meat was tender and the bread had a good flavor. There was a brown mustard topping that rounded everything together well. However, it wasn't amazing, It was a solid sandwich with good ingredients, but the meat wasn't particularly flavorful. Since it is close to work, I will probably try it again, but this is another place that I wouldn't drive to."}
