{"text":"We went to La Catrina last night and had a group of 13 ppl which included 4 kids!
The best Mexican Food we've ever had! I've lived everywhere including the USA for 10 years and this restaurant blew any others away!! They also have a very kid friendly menu!  Prices are amazing and the service was fast, friendly and very personal!!
We ate

Guacamole with Fresh Tortillas -heaven!!!

shrimp Ceviche (one with tomato) -fresh and delicious, lot's of flavour 

Queso with cheese, mushrooms and Poblano peppers!! Yummy!!!

Fish Tacos- Best ever!  

My husband had a beef taco with bacon and chorizo he can't stop thinking about them!

Try this little taste of heaven in Brampton!"}
{"text":"I walk by this place everyday and I finally decided to try it. The service was excellent. Lucky my boyfriend and I got there when we did though because the tables filled up fast! The food was good, but not great. I ordered chicken tacos and because of the way it was served, had no idea how to eat them. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't any side with the meal, I came home and was hungry again in an hour. A little over priced, but it was a nice atmosphere. They had a band playing lovely Mexican music!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to go the the New Mexican place in Brampton and it was scrumptious. So nice to have a REAL Mexican place so close to home.
They're new so although they have wine, beer, and tequila, they don't have the full bar yet to make genuine margeuritas. The waitress was so great, she said they could mix tequila with lime or grapefruit soda... haha
anyways, they start u with great in house made chips with tomatillo salsa & veerrrrry spicy red salsa on the house, and I highly recommend the fish tacos."}
{"text":"I LOVE LA CATRINA.  I have been coming here since they first opened and will continue to be a repeat customer.  The delicious authentic Mexican food has tons of variety. The service is friendly and attentive.  They have no problem accommodating their customers with specific food preferences.  For example,  my father in law is an extremely picky eater and they came up with something to satisfy his needs.  They can make anything into a vegetarian plate if needed.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican spot, nothing too spectacular, service was great, however the food isn't too over the top and some items are not justify by its price."}
{"text":"You need these tacos in you mouth. The ceviche is the best this side of the border. 

Can confirm."}
{"text":"Great food.....large quantity, good service. Nice decor too and we didn't have to wait long to be served!"}
{"text":"been wanting to try this place, we finally did, very disappointed, will never go back again.
we ordered the empanadas to take home and it was chewy and not tasty. 
we had the melted cheese appetizer but it was the last dish to come out - very greasy and it was just as if I ate a block of mozzerella that was melted.  on the menu it said fried chorizo & some type of sweet pepper - no chorizo & 1 thin sliver of green & red pepper.    we ordered the fish taco as recommended but i thought it was the fried fish but instead it was mashed up pieces of fish in some type of seasoning, not pleasant.  tried the steak & shrimp taco, the steak was chewy
asked for a glass of water, not even any ice and it looked like & tasted like tap water."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best restaurant in the downtown area! The staff and chef in the back treat you like family. I had an issue with my dish because I was confused with the menu and the Chef personally came out and suggested another dish and made sure it wasn't too spicy for me. 

They make the best Guacamole I've EVER tasted!

Extremely affordable, great staff and amazing food...10/10 Would eat again!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Love the tacos and it's nice to have real Mexican in Brampton. I used to have their food at the farmers market all the time. So happy to have a restaurant to visit."}
{"text":"Went to la catrina on a Friday evening and the live music was a bonus! We ordered guacamole, vuelve la vida ceviche as appetizers and they were okay (guac didn't have enough flavour and ceviche had olives which I dislike) but the main pleasers were their tacos! We ordered the carnitas, fried fish, Acapulco, and discada and they were all delish! We ordered the churros (comes with three) for dessert but they were undercooked on the inside which, however the tacos had amazing flavour which is why I'm giving this place a four star. Will be definitely coming back to try their other tacos!"}
{"text":"Food is very good. Nicely presented, authentic and well priced.  One of our regular Brampton stops now."}
{"text":"I've heard pretty positive reviews about this place, so my husband and I decided to pay a visit. We came on a Thursday night and was surprised to see that it was quite busy! Especially for a weekday, in Brampton! 

We ordered the Shrimp and Octopus Ceviche (Very Flavorful!), The Fish Tacos (Probably the best I've had in along time! Fish was crispy on the outside and melt in my mouth on the inside) and the Emmoladas (Mole sauce was unreal!). Service was friendly and very helpful with the menu!

I'm happy to say that this place is an absolute gem! Go pay a visit and see for yourself!

We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I would go back if just for the large, fresh and delicious Churros.

The food is good, and being in Brampton where the next option for Mexican is Taco bell or Burrito Boys(don't get me wrong I love Burrito boys), it's a nice spot to have lunch/dinner.

I had the ceviche, it wasn't bad, but I was hoping for it to be a bit thicker. 

For my entree, I had the platter - Conchinita Pibil - the spices and flavours were so good. But I found the refritos a little runny. I normally order it with my food at other mexican restaurants and its more dense. Which wasn't the case here, so that disappointed me a little. But the carne and arroz was great.

Then we ordered the churros.....I was in heaven, so was my girlfriend. It was lightly dusted with the sugar and cinnamon perfectly! We vowed to come back for coffee and churros when we want a little dessert.

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The service was great! I went with a group of five and we each tried something different. We tried the chicken tinga quesadilla, pescado tacos, picadillo burrito, cubana tortas and chicken tinga platter. We all enjoyed our dishes. We found the food was authentic. I am definitely looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to get authentic Mexican food in the Brampton area. I got the fish tacos and they are delicious and great portions for the price. There is always a large amount of freshly fried fish in the tacos. The platers and burritos are also always well done. Very authentic atmosphere. The service is friendly, most dishes did not take too long to make. Would recommend to anyone and have already gone back twice. They give complementary salsa (2 types when I went) and nachos, and the salsa given is very delicious and seems home made."}
{"text":"If you are craving Mexican food and you live near Brampton this restaurant is a great option. I find there aren't many options in the area. It's not a fancy place but the food is great. It's generally not too busy anytime we've gone. 
We've been a few times and by far my favourite items are : guacamole and fish tacos.
The guc is a good appetizer size and comes with chips so it's great to share. 
The fish tacos are to die for - I like them grilled but they do taste much better fried! 
Def a must try."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to this restaurant several dozen times and I thought I had left a review.  If so had, I would have given this restaurant a solid 4+ stars way back when.

However, since my last time here some things have changed, and sadly not for the better.

First off...the food is still good.

However the hospitality and treatment of repeat customers has made me not want to come back.

What hasn't changed: 
The food is still good and of good quality. 

The lunch menu prices haven't changed over the past two years.

They still tend to not have items in stock.  My wife wanted to order the octopus/shrimp ceviche and like the last two times...it wasn't in stock (again!)

What has changed:
The general feeling of welcome and acceptance.  The courtesy to customers and potential customers is no longer there.

Prior to this meal, the restaurant used to provide free chips while waiting/ordering. Now, there is a fee for each refill. Not being aware of this, my wife had two refills while waiting (these chips are served in a small soup bowl). We were not made aware of this until after we were presented out bill when the waitress advised that she had to change the bill due to the refills.  I asked when this changed as we've been there for lunches and dinner many times and this was a new practice.

Well, she said she would speak to the manager (whom we've met and spoke to many times in the past and could see through the kitchen window.) Well, she wouldn't come out to see us (we were the last lunchtime patrons in the restaurant at the time as they close at 3pm until 5pm to prepare for dinner service..it was about 2:45 on a Friday).

The second was even though the restaurant was closed from 3-5 pm, people were coming in around 230 and we're being turned away which in my opinion was a little crazy. Lunch tends to be quick, yet they were told that the kitchen was closed.

The latter was well...a little disappointing, but the former for the change in practice, and the manager not wanting to talk to us regarding the bill and new practice really turned me off.

Had she taken the time to come out, chat and tell us that it changed xx weeks ago, and wrote it off (it was only $2, but it's still the experience and courtesy) it would have been acceptable and left me with not such a bad taste in my mouth.  

I would have then known for NEXT time, and would have both  gladly and knowingly paid for the refills (my wife loves the chips!)

But since that wasn't the case, it encourages me to look elsewhere for another authentic Mexican style restaurant as I will never be going back here again!

So long and thanks for all the fish!"}
{"text":"So happy to find a Mexican restaurant that isn't the standard tex-mex.  Definitely has very authentic tastes and is extremely fresh (chips were fried per order).  I tried carnitas and chorizo tacos as well as two tamale stuffed with chicken and peppers.  All of it was delicious - nice soft tamale dough that wasn't too thick and definitely wasn't freezer burnt (which is a common issue where ever I have ordered them elsewhere on the East coast).  The tacos came with the most amazing roja salsa - very spicy and acidic.

My husband got poblano peppers stuffed with cheese and beef topped with a white cheese sauce and pomegranate seeds.  This dish was amazing.

Our children got the bistek and rice- they were all big fans.  

To drink I had the Mexican coffee - very nice cinnamon notes.  Our kids got Pineapple water (which is what it sounds like) and really enjoyed it as well.

The price was also extremely reasonable.  All of us were very very happy with our meals."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my wife and kids.   The shrimp tacos were excellent.  The service was fast and friendly.  Waitress always had a smile and played with my baby.  The churros were perfectly cooked.  I would recommend if you are looking for authentic Mexican food.  It reminded me of the taco standa in Tijuana."}
{"text":"Food is lovely and portions are right. Prices are reasonable.
We got good service. Definitely La Catrina is a place in Brampton one should try out."}
{"text":"Was searching up Mexican food in Toronto, and out of curiosity searched Brampton since we live here and I'm so glad I found this gem of a restaurant. Hidden on Queen st in downtown Brampton right next to the banks, you'll find La Catrina. 

We walked in and got seated promptly. There was live music playing which was a delight. After reading many reviews with recommendations about the fish tacos we knew we had to try those.  One of the best ways to tell if a restaurant is good is to see who eats there. For a Mexican restaurant we were delighted to see many familys of Hispanic background. We knew we were at the right place. Our server was amazing at helping us decide what everything else on the menu consisted of. Which in turn became a feast since everything looked so good. 

As soon as we were seated, we were given fresh nachos and 2 different kinds of salsa complimentary. Who doesn't love free stuff. After which we ordered, which consisted of the following. For appetizers we got Queso Fundido ( a cheese dip with mushrooms), amazingly cheesy as the name suggests was served in a cast iron skillet. For main courses we ordered 2 items. The fried fish tacos because they are a must have. And a Veracruz Fish Platter. Both these dishes were flavorful and extremely fresh, which only made the flavor so much better. The 3 tacos we ordered were so big, we ended up bringing one home. And the platter was beyond words. The fish was cooked so perfectly my wife kept eating the fish even though we were both full. We also ordered a Mexican Soda called Jarritos in pineapple flavor. A surprisingly good drink to go with the flavors of the food. Though we were full, we ordered 2 desserts since both of us are huge foodies. The churros were fresh soft and oh so good. The custard we ordered was a house recipe and was the perfect way to end the meal. Even after all this our bill was quite shy of $50. It was truly one amazing experience. One place we shall be visiting very soon. Thank you to the staff and management for such a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I had such a terrible experience. The food had absolutely no flavour and portion size is definitely not worth the money being spent. I had visited this restaurant when they opened up. Food was delicious back then and the portions were huge. Something has changed for sure....."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian showed up and found there was nothing on the menu. The wait staff was more than friendly and helpful in making us a custom item, letting us try a sauce to make sure that it was to our liking. The food itself tasted amazing and would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My mom wanted to go out for Mexican food for her birthday and after a long search for somewhere that was birthday-nice, I found La Catrina in Brampton. This is THE BEST dining experience I have ever had with my family. 

The staff are very kind and Chef Eduardo was happy to accommodate my parents, my mom is strictly vegetarian and my dad will eat a little chicken on the rare occasion but no fish or other meat. 

WE ALL LOVED THE FOOD. 

For appetizers we had the aguachile (best shrimp I've had in my life - I could eat it every day) and the queso fundido with poblano peppers (my parents devoured it).  

For our main courses, we ordered a puntas de res (beef platter), 2 conchita pibil (pulled pork platter), the chicken enchiladas, and my mom got the gorditas (they were stuffed with refried beans and guacamole and some other stuff as a vegetarian option. I tried them and they were wonderful). The pulled pork was moist and flavourful and the cactus salad (I substituted it for my rice) was really refreshing.  

The food itself is not spicy but the three sauces they bring to your table were AMAZING and the perfect amount of spicy. We finished them off! A server that wasn't even assigned our table brought us more when we ran out. And when we asked for boxes for our leftovers our server brought little containers so my mom could take the leftover sauces home too! I told our server that we were celebrating my mom's birthday, and how much she loved the sauces, and the little containers she brought out just made my mom's day. I told her the food was amazing and we had a wonderful time and would definitely be back! She said she would let the chef know.  

Then the chef came out to chat with us! He's a very nice man and a talented chef. He's also very humble, saying that they are his grandmother's recipes! And honestly, I've never had food like it so you know that's a family that knows good food and takes pride in doing it right. 

We were all too stuffed to try any of the desserts but before we could pay for the bill our server and a third server came out with a piece of the tres leches cake with a candle in it for my mom! She was thrilled and the cake was incredibly moist and just the right amount of sweetness. They even played their traditional birthday song over their sound system for my mom, which was absolutely lovely of them. 

If you want generic, bland food with no personality that's prepared with no passion don't go to La Catrina - go to a chain and enjoy the mundane. If you want to go somewhere to make some memories while eating delicious food in a friendly environment then go to La Catrina. This is the kind of place that deserves to make it big and the staff are the kind of people who know how to treat their customers like they matter. 

Needless to say - I plan on returning and will keep on spreading the word! If anyone from La Catrina reads this, thanks again for making my mom's birthday so wonderful for her. I wish your restaurant ALL the success!"}
{"text":"Great food. Everything is homemade and fresh (even the salsa's). The staff are very friendly. I recommend the burrito's since they are the best bang for you buck."}
{"text":"Finally, a real Mexican restaurant!!  While the restaurant doesn't appear finished and the wait staff have great attitudes but still need some experience, the grand opening was fun!

The menu is very long and in my opinion, could use some major trimming, Having 4 (I think?) options for pork tacos alone has got to be tough for the kitchen and overwhelming to customers. Maybe cutting the taco and burrito menu to be more like the options that were available at the farmers market?  The other items could be daily specials.    

There are many different ceviche options. The one we had was amazing and so fresh!  It was also an extremely generous portion with more than enough to share, full of shrimp, fish and perfectly tender octopus.  I could make a meal out of the ceviche by itself.

We also had the queso fundido with chorizo. It was rich and again, a generous portion!  Wish there had been another tortilla or 2 served with it and I'm sure if I had asked, our waitress would have gotten some for us. Again, her attitude was great, even if she couldn't pronounce the food names.

The tamales (both red and green) were also excellent, just as they were at the Brampton Farmers Market over the summer. These were the reason we came and while they weren't on the dinner menu, our wonderful waitress was able to make our evening by securing a couple of each for us!! Again, these were the reason we came and we were not disappointed!!  

The mole was spicy and flavorful but a bit thicker than I'm used to. That's not a bad thing, just different. The rice that came with it left a lot to be desired.  I don't know why I didn't get any beans but I didn't miss them. I was already very full from the ceviche, tamales and queso fundido. 

And the final item we had was the posole. I've never had white posole before, just red or green.  The white was pretty bland and I'm not sure it was finished. It was basically just some chicken broth, hominy and shredded chicken. I'm used to posole that comes with lots of condiments, like radishes, oregano, diced onions, lime wedges, tortilla strips, etc. It might be comforting if you had a cold or if you spiced it up with some hot sauce but as it was, I won't order it again. 

Overall, the food was good. very traditional, fresh and ample portions. They seem to have opened before they were really ready.  They need to finish the floors, add some decor to the walls, have the staff learn the menu and stop serving drinks in cans.  

Even if they don't change a thing though, I'll be back for that ceviche and the tamales!!  I can't wait to try the taquitos and the pescadero tacos with mango coleslaw and Dona Nona's flan and the enchilada suizas and............so much more!  

Yup.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Lived in Tucson, AZ before Pittsburgh, so I'm always excited when a new, nearby Mexican restaurant opens up. However, I'd held off visiting La Catrina after seeing the initial Yelp reviews. Well, that was a big mistake, as I've been depriving myself of easily some of the best Mexican in the area.

We went this past Saturday evening when it was bitterly cold and the roads still a mess from the previous night's snowfall. As a result, we were one of only two parties for dinner.  The owner Demetrio, who is a fellow Dormont resident, chatted with us for awhile when we first arrived--super friendly and welcoming. (His wife does all the cooking.) He also brought us a plate of chips with chicken tinga (on the house) while we were waiting for the rest of our order. The chips were light and fresh, and the chicken tinga was tender and flavorful. 

We ordered the \"classic nachos\" at my daughter's request. The nachos were definitely lighter than is typical, with enough tasty melted cheese, black beans, crema, pico de gallo, guac, and steak to ensure some on every chip, but not so much to weigh it down. For entrees we ordered a taco platter (one each of carnitas, steak, and ground beef), the enchiladas de mole con pollo (chicken enchiladas with mole sauce), enchiladas verdes con bistek (cheese enchilada with green sauce and a think steak), and chiles en ahogada (stuffed poblano peppers with cream sauce, one  stuffed with cheese, one with beef).  We all gushed over our entrees, and appreciated how careful attention was paid to each element. For example, the chiles en ahogada were sprinkled with pomegranate seeds that perfectly complemented the balance of cream sauce, roasted peppers with just a bit of heat, and (what appeared to be) queso fresco filling.  Even the black beans that accompanied the dishes were delicious, as was the side of nopales we ordered.

We ended the dinner with churros (again requested by my daughter) that arrived drizzled with chocolate sauce.  We were all stuffed from the meal, but managed to make room for the churros (a good decision) before heading back out into the cold.

We'll definitely be back, perhaps on a Sunday when Demetrio told us there are a bunch of off-menu dishes that are available, including posole!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give my experience a higher rating because I love supporting small businesses (especially so close to home), but this was just all around disappointing.

I ordered the conchinita pibil platter which is a seasoned shredded pork that is served with rice, refried beans, corn tortillas and guacamole (supposed to). My platter did not include guacamole and included a very small sprinkling of pico de gallo instead. The server said they were all out of guacamole. All out of guacamole at 12PM on a weekday in a Mexican restaurant? WTF! First red flag.

The rice was atrocious. Pretty much inedible. It looked nothing like the rice pictured in other Yelper's reviews. The previously pictured rice looks orange-coloured (with spices, presumably) and is loose on the plate. The rice I was served was clumped in a small mound and it was the colour of rice pudding. It pretty much had the consistency of thick rice pudding, but unfortunately without the pleasant flavour of rice pudding. So it was off-white, sticky, almost flavourless, clumpy dreck. Frankly, I don't know how you could do worse to rice. 

The refried beans were so far from refried beans it was almost laughable. I don't know whether they just decided to stretch out last night's refried beans by adding a whole potful of bean water to them, but it wouldn't surprise me if that's what they did. The beans were closer to bean soup than refried beans. Beans are not expensive; you do not need to cheap out and water them down so much.

The seasoned shredded pork was decent, but it was served lukewarm rather than warm or hot. I tried my dining companion's pork carnitas and these were not pork carnitas. This was just shredded pork without the seasoning. Carnitas are chunks, not shreds. And carnitas are more tender than the rather dry shredded pork I tried off my dining companion's plate.

I'd love to have a go-to local Mexican joint, but this doesn't look like it's going to fit the bill when you factor in the guacamoleless state of a Mexican restaurant, the watered down soupy beans, the weird clumpy rice, and the lukewarm proteins. Not sure I'd give them another chance, unfortunately."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5* star 

I've been meaning to come check this restaurant out. I pass it on a weekly basis! 

I finally took the plunge and I'm glad I did. This is great spot to add to the limited food options that downtown Brampton has to offer. 

When you first walk in you get a great sense of \"home ness\". It has authentic looking decor and and bright colours. 

The service here was great, the server when asked to provide descriptions and help with the menu was very knowledgable and helped us choose the right entrees for our meals.

The food was good, a few things can be improved. We ordered:

Tacos - were great
Enchiladas - great
Shrimp appetizer - shrimp size was too small
Nachos - not enough meat 
Stew of the day - really tasty and filling


I would probably come back again to try other items but would consider another joint first! But still great, good for locals!"}
{"text":"We come here every so often. Love the fact that they have live music playing!

Dishes we've tried include the fish tacos, chicken tacos, chicken mole, shredded pork entree, and churros.

Can't complain about anything!

As a tip for those driving, there's street parking right in front of the resto."}
{"text":"came here when BlogTo had an article of restaurants to try in Brampton.

it was fairly new when we went so they had ran out of many chicken tacos. 

there seemed to be an overlaying gaze in the restaurant - hopefully it was fixed.

didn't love the place, but didn't hate it either."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with my girlfriend... food was amazing. Portion was great, must try the tacos"}
{"text":"Food is really good and the price for the food is great. The only downside was that there was no beer and certain things from the menu wasn't available. Also the refried beans are a little watery, and the only drinks they had was coke sprite and water. Still enjoyed the place. It was a little chilly in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Top notch Mexican place.  Ceviche and guacamole were fantastic.  We also tried two authentic Mexican drinks....One was a sweet cinnamon milky drink which helped alleviate the hotness of the dipping sauces served with the guacamole. The second was a sweet hibiscus juice which I really loved. These drink cost a whopping $2 and are homemade :) excellent deal!! I will definitely be back to try many more delicious treats. Also note worthy good family friendly environment with superior service."}
{"text":"Went on a saturday night at 6:45, just before a live guitarist came to sing for the entire restaurant.    Chicken tacos ($11) are really good but gorditas ($8) not as good.......enchaladas ($11) were not bad.    The servers had a hard time keeping up with the rrstaurant 3/4 full, but they are nice.    Water is served in picling jars which is different.   Fried churros ($5) are excellent.  Wine is too pricey at $9 a glass. Highly recommend this place for authentic mexican.....must try in downtown Brampton!"}
{"text":"An absolute gem! 

Very clean,  nice authentic interiorer. It's a sit down place but prices are very reasonable. 

I ordered the Cochinita pibil (shredded pork) - $9. I ordered it without lettuce or refried beans and asked if I could get sautéed onions which it doesn't usually come with. 

I figured it might be small do to my substitutions  but it wasn't. 

It was amazing,  and the 2 hot sauce they give you on the side are amazing as well. 

I'll definately be back again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent! If you wish some hot, delicious food to tease and please your palate, this is the place to be. With a wide variety of Latin dishes, from mild to hot, you will hate to leave this quiet, roomy and delightful little palace. 

The service equals or tops the simple Latin cuisine with your desire being served exactly as you wish. You will return."}
{"text":"I went tonight with my husband and step-son. I used to have a lot of Mexican food where I came from, and I have really missed it--until today! The food was so delicious, but it was no surprise since they've been serving up great food at the Brampton Farmers Market for a few years. 

I had conchinita pibil, which is this amaaaaazing shredded pork that they had at the market so I already knew I liked it. My step-son had a tamal (masa corn meal and pork steamed in a corn husk) and a carne asada (steak) quesadilla, and my husband had a mild shredded chicken I forget the name of. 

We also ordered the white pozole (comforting soup with corn hominy), which comes with a side plate of various things to put in, such as queso fresco (a fresh, salty farmers cheese), a cactus and onion empanada (a fried semicircular pie), a chicken flauta (a rolled, stuffed, fried tortilla), and veggies and pork rinds and things. It was another big entree all on its own, really, but I really wanted to try it as I hadn't seen it since moving to Canada about five years ago.

They also had tamarindo to drink, which is like lemonade, but made with tamarind. It's tart and sweet and refreshing.

All the food was really good and served with seasonings and really delicious salsas. The red salsa was spicy and fresh, and the green was tangy and thick. I didn't try the dry spice mixes because I was so enthralled with the salsas. 

Everyone enjoyed their food very much and we all sampled everything. SO GOOD!

The service was also delightful. Our server got us everything we ordered, and quickly, and with a smile. She delighted in sharing the menu with us and answering all of our questions. The chef even came out to see us and ask how we were enjoying everything. Since it was a slower time of day (we got there around 4 p.m.) it was really nice that he took the time to do that. He recognized us from the Farmers Market, too, so that was cool. 

My only criticism, and it is a small one, is that the platters probably should come with a few more tortillas. I suppose I could have asked for them, but truth was with all of the sampling I was really full and didn't need them. We took home leftovers. 

Finally, they really made the place beautiful. The colours are warm and clean, the lighting is pleasant and flattering. I like the sign outside, too. Their dia de los muertos-inspired logo of La Catrina is really cool and eye-catching.

Anyhow! Highly recommended. I hope that they are here for years and years to come."}
{"text":"Was across the street at Las Palmas for a quick taco, but we always are interested in checking out up-and-comer's so we came over for dinner. Food was good, and the people friendly and professional. Very authentic! Live music was a very nice touch. Only complaint, Portions could have been alot more generous for the price. we admittedly ate on the cheap side, but at most mexican restaurants we would have had leftovers, and here we all left hungry. Well be back, tho!"}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews, but sadly this place deserves no more than 1 or 2 stars. The chips that came with the guac were store bought, and tasted like the cheapest ones you could buy. The cheese dip came from a can or jar, or at least that's the way it tasted. I honestly buy better guac at Aldi, and the fajitas were just okay...to top it off, most entrees are $15, which is too much for what you get. Maybe 20 years ago the quality would have been passable in Pittsburgh, but since we now have some fantastic Mexican restaurants, I really can't see this place staying in business. Do yourself a favor and go across the street to El Milagro, or head down to La Palapa in the South Side."}
{"text":"Heard about this Mexican restaurant getting great reviews on Yelp and had to try it, so hubby and I went for Saturday lunch. Quaint little place in the heart of downtown Brampton, lively Mexican decor. The complimentary chips and dips are great, and we also ordered guacamole as an app. Freshly made, it was a bit too oniony for me (I am not a fan of raw onions) but I would order again (love guac). Both of us had the fish tacos, which were amazing. Beautifully cooked fish, crunchy coleslaw salad, and sauce with a bit of a bite. Yummy! The portion size was generous, no skimping on the fish. To finish, we ordered the churro desert. Again, yummy, with the only criticism that I would like to have the option of a side sauce. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Upon arrival to this cute authentic restaurant, we were super excited and impressed with the decor and even the plates (lol). 

Unfortunately, as good as the food looked, it didnt taste up to par. There was also a lack in veg or seafood options as most of the meat was pork. We ended up eating the fish taco's and everyone who did suffered that night (to say the least). 

The room temp made it feel humid and sticky inside and this was on an autumn day.. not sure if that had something to do with our food poisoning. 

Overall, good food.. until you're sick. I'm giving this place 3 stars because this could have just been a 1 time thing."}
{"text":"I may have been a bit over zealous in my first review. That, and with some issues with consistency at times means it's a little off from a perfect review. Still a good place and great value, but there are a couple areas to improve upon."}
{"text":"5 stars for the waitstaff and the Picadillo platter. The prices are great. It's a great place to stop by while running errands- not so much a place you want to hang w friends at it go on a date night. The interior is basic cafeteria style and I didn't care much for the chipped side plates: I know they add ambiance and charm but from a health stand point those cracks harbor bacteria. I still stand by my 5 stars for the food, prices and service. Cheers."}
{"text":"I have been here twice since they opened and the food just keeps getting better for me. Very happy I opted to give the place a second chance because it was well worth it and my group LOVED it as well. My only issue in my second visit is that they aren't really set up for take out, but really not the end of the world. I can assume that they will keep getting better while going through the learning curve as I've experienced first hand so far. The churros are a must no matter what! I can't wait to dine in again soon for the full experience; pretty sure I'll be editing my review to go deeper and possibly bump the rating.  Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Great impression from my first visit. I had an incredible lunch and tried a wide variety of items. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. The beef & fish tacos were top notch. Great service also. Worth a try to say the least."}
{"text":"I went to La Catrina last night and despite the slew of mixed reviews in regards to the food being flavourless and bland, I disagree. 

The aesthetic of the restaurant is authentically Mexican from the decor to the names of the items on the menu. It's a quaint and cozy little spot that's definitely family friendly. 

I ordered two of the carnitas tacos and as previously mentioned, contrary to previous reviews about the dishes lacking flavour these definitely did not! The meat was insanely tender, cooked to perfection, and the condiments inside the tacos elevated the flavour profiles of the dish. 

Many reviews also claimed qualms with the fact that they did not serve alcohol but that's since changed. 

They also host some live acts, which was my reason for going in order to see Mountain and the Wood, a new up and coming duo. It was a great space to host things of that nature and hopefully they continue because it sets them apart from most places, especially in Brampton. 

Overall this was a great place and should definitely be somewhere to check out if you're in the mood for some authentic style Mexican food."}
{"text":"I drove 55km specifically to eat dinner here to find the lights off with a note on the door saying they're closed for Christmas when we went on Saturday Dec. 23rd. That's just a regular day. Christmas Eve is on Dec. 24th.. On top of the many days when they're sold out of chicken. I'm frustrated with this place. The food is delicious but it's like a coin toss whether I'll be upset or not. 

Better call this place before you go to make sure that they're open and have chicken available (if that's what you wanted)."}
{"text":"After reading raving reviews, we decided to give it a shot. Was thoroughly disappointed. Food was 100% under-seasoned, texture of the meat and tortilla shells was disappointing and rough, flavours were off balanced and did not play well off each other (the fish taco was acceptable but the batter was a bit too oily and lacked sauces). It was hard to finish the meal without forcing ourselves. At the end of the meal, for some reason, the was a predominately notable bitter aftertaste that lasted longer than comfort."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sat evening and the atmosphere was nice. They had a live band which I loved. It's a pretty small place with minimal seating so we were lucky to get a seat. I ordered the crispy chicken which was fried tacos not fried chicken in a taco. We didn't like it and found that it strangely didn't taste like chicken. I ordered the chicken tinga platter and my friend ordered the fish ceviche. They were both very good and flavourful. The waitress was very friendly but she was the only waitress and we had to wait often for her. She was really busy and they should have had more servers on a Sat evening. It was still a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"The pebil tacos are fantastic! The other tacos are pretty good too! Unfortunately I'm allergic to chicken so I can't have anything else on their menu except apps and dessert and those weren't very good. Their guacamole is especially bad."}
{"text":"We went to La Catrina for dinner on Friday October 9, 2015.  
If you have read into the background of this resto, remember that it is \"Acapulco Style\" Mexican Food.    Note:  Items have been removed from their menu.  Refer to my photos of the menu for the omissions. 

We ordered the following dishes:  Fish Tacos, Chicken Tinga Tacos, Chorizo Nachos and their Tampiquena BBQ Entree.  Our waitress returned after a couple of minutes to advise that their Butcher had failed on them and they could not provide the Tampiquena BBQ.  WHAA?!?!  So we stuck with the two types of tacos and the nachos.  Our waitress brought over three types of sauces and a complimentary basket of In-house made Nachos.  She explained that the Brown sauce was the hottest, green was second in heat and the dark red the mildest.  She even confirmed this with another waitress.  In my opinion, the Brown was mild, green-mild and dark red-hot.  Weird.
  
About the food.
I shall begin with the complimentary basket of plain Nacho Chips.  Nice!  Kinda oily but crisp and tasty with the three sauces.  
The Nachos:   8 bucks. Nice! The same Nachos as the comp.  Chips were oily and the dish lacked in cheese, guac and chorizo.  The cheese was spread only on the top of the nachos and not layered throughout.  Very small amount of chorizo and guac sprinkled about the plate too.   
Fish Tacos:  The overall presentation of the Fish Tacos was impressive however the combination of flavours did not meld together well for me.  .    
The Chicken Tinga Taco: they were tasted first without any sauces and will be described as bland in flavour.  Now with the addition of one or all of the three sauces provided it brought up the flavour.

The Service.
The waitress was attentive and checked up on us frequently.  
The serving staff might also have been new hires with the sauce mix up and all.  
  
The ambiance.
Standard tables and chairs.  No music playing in the background so it was nice and quiet. No fancy decorations but still welcoming and clean.  For a Friday night at 630pm it was not busy at all.  Only three other tables were occupied. The resto had a unique Lacquered OSB floor. 

Misc.
I don't believe the resto has a parking lot but there was plenty of street parking that is free after 6pm.    

To wrap it all up, I was honestly disappointed with the food.  I came in with such high expectations from all of the great reviews.   If you have seen the online photo of the Tampiquena BBQ Entree you would so understand my feeling of extreme devastation come the denial of the dish. The Modelo was smooth and made me feel better.  lol.   Advice to Owner: Team meeting before service so staff understands what menu items are available.  Now I didn't see the Main Chef /Owner working in the kitchen which could possibly explain our \"off the norm\" culinary experience but who knows. 

Peace out Yelpers!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed lunch here today!

Friendly service and delicious homemade Mexican food.

Complimentary chips and salsa were tasty.

I opted for the posole which came with platter of fresh veggies, two taquitos, and chiccarones. Totally yummy. Also ordered a tamale which was oh so good.

BF got two fish tacos, and one cochinchita pibil (pork) - he said they were awesome. It must be true because I didn't get a bite ;)

All in all, it was a great experience and we will return next time we are in Brampton!"}
{"text":"Seemed like the queso was from a jar, just wasn't very good Mexican food. Husband and son were very disappointed. I have been eating Mexican food all of my life, so we  were excited to give it a try. The fajitas were not even average. I don't like giving bad reviews either , but when I know that I will never return to a place because the experience wasn't good all the way around then I feel I wasted my time and money."}
{"text":"Great authentic Acapulco food! Easy laid back family atmosphere. The tacos are a must have, ask to be given the Chefs favorite ones; cochinita pibil. Great to see Brampton added good little places on the downtown stripe."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to La Catrina looking to satisfy a craving for some yummy tacos.  We went around 8:30pm on Sunday night and there were only a few tables seated.   We quickly decided we wanted the nachos, enchiladas moladas, crispy chicken tacos, and the picadillo (ground beef tacos).   It was a few minutes before the server came to take our order and he quickly retuned with our drinks.  A minute or two later he came back to let us know he had forgotten they had ran out of chicken...not a huge deal and I guess not unbelievable since we were there fairly late.  So we switched our crispy chicken tacos and enchiladas moladas to two orders of the fried fish tacos.  I'm not even mad they didn't have any chicken left because those fish tacos were insane!  the tacos came our first and they were all delicious. The beef tacos were flavorful with a little bit of spice, but it was the fish tacos that had me in heaven.  The fish was perfectly cooked and flaky, the coleslaw salad gave it crunch, crispiness and freshness, and the chipotle mayonnaise tied it all together. Amazing, I'd go back just for those fish tacos.   Then came the nachos. I've read some other not so positive reviews of the nachos and I'm a little confused to be honest because I thought they were great.  The cheese they use and the chorizo gives them a unique flavor that's addictive.  Truly wonderful. Finally, we had the churros for dessert of course.  they serve three of them per order and it was plenty for the two of us.   They were freshly made, hot, crispy, golden and sugary on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  they were absolutely delicious.  My only complaint is I was expecting a chocolate sauce or dulce de leche to be served with the churros but there wasn't anything.   I'm sure they would have given us something had we asked but we didn't bother.  
All in all we really enjoyed the food, the service was a little slow but perfectly pleasant and the establishment is beautifully decorated.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My partner and I went on a late Saturday afternoon. It's a quaint reataurant with cool decor. The staff were very nice. They do not serve alcohol yet. At the table they give you homemade chips served with two types of sauces (mild and hot). The chips were warm and slightly oily but delicious. We ordered fish tacos and chicken tacos. My goodness, they were the best tacos I've ever had! The tacos are not stuffed to the brim, making them more appealing and easy to enjoy. Service was prompt and the entrees arrived approximately 15 minutes after ordering. It was a great experience overall and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last night for dinner for the first time and we were pleasantly surprised with the food and ambiance. 

Our waitress whom is the owner as well, greeted us with a smile, provided suggestions from the menu and was always checking in on us throughout the time we were there. 

We ordered the fish tacos and the veracruz fish platter. The portions were big and hearty for the price we paid. We enjoyed every bite and nothing was left on our plates. 

We ended the night with churros (made fresh to order) and had asked for chocolate sauce on the side which, we weren't too crazy about. 

Overall we loved this place and will definitely be returning sometime soon! A recommended visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"How this place has such high reviews is beyond puzzling.  The food is bland, expensive, tiny portions, and to top it off they have no alcohol whatsoever and no plans to ever get any.  $9 for guacamole that was brown and had gigantic chunks of tomato and raw white onion.  Carnitas that were so greasy (and nothing but pulled pork, it is NOT crispy or even remotely authentic) that they ate through the entire soggy tortilla shell.  Takeout is even worse than the dine-in experience as the food literally is saturated with oil and disintegrates before you will even get home.

Have I mentioned THEY DON'T SERVE BEER WITH THEIR TACOS.  That alone warrants a poor review IMO, just ridiculous

To summarize, I think the value is poor, food below average, and overall just not worth the return visit or recommendation at all"}
{"text":"The portions were HUGE. But the meat for the most part was very dry. We had the chicken and pork platters. Also the meat and the food in general lacked a punch."}
{"text":"Most of my stars are going to the nachos...the good parts of it.

Came around the dinner time hour on a weekday and good thing we got there when we did!  The place filled up quickly after us and every seat in the restaurant was filled.

My friend and I started with the nachos.  However, if we had known you get complimentary nachos, we probably wouldn't have ordered the app.  The tortilla chips are house made and yes, they are greasy, but they are pretty good.  Honestly, and I've read the same in other reviews, if they weren't so chince on guac and chorizo, the nachos would be so much better.  The chorizo IS good but there's so little of it.  The guac is a tiny dollop on the pile of nachos (see pic).  My friend asked for salsa but I don't think they carry or make any.  We were given some pico de gallo instead, which was delicious!  I pretty much ate all of it.

My friend ordered the chicken tinga tacos and I got the fish tacos.  I really should've slowed down and not filled up on the nachos because I could barely eat my tacos.  They looked great but I don't think they were anything special.  I only ate half of one and gave the other one to my friend.  It might've been because I was pretty full to enjoy the fish tacos but I don't think I'd get them again.  I did try some of the chicken tinga taco and it really was not for me.  The texture is really weird and the flavours weren't outstanding."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some good Mexican in Brampton, head over to La Catrina.  Love their fish tacos, ceviche and chicken tinga platter (with generous serving size) and their service is very friendly and courteous.  We were served fresh tortillas and salsa while we waited for our takeout order. Don't forget to try their churros! 
A cool, artistic vibe boasting colourful walls and filled with Mexican folk art. Also very family-friendly."}
{"text":"I found this place craving mexican and writing \"mexican food\" in yelp, since it was close we decided to try it... amd I have to say it is AMAZING! I am mexican and I am always very skeptical of what people call \"real mexican food\", well, this is real mexican food! Hubby and I are soooo happy to have found this place. The staff is also very welcoming and nice. I had the Pozole (only available on weekends) and it was perfect! Flavorful,  warm and homemade!!! Definitely a place worth trying!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and generally tasty.  I had the Tampiqueno Steak.
The menu was original and more authentic than most Mexican Restaurants you'll find in Toronto. I found the salsa to be to hot although it was flavorful. 
The staff was friendly and helpful although occasionally distracted even though it was slow in Boxing Day evening."}
{"text":"Had the best Tamales with a green salsa sauce. Ver tasty and perfectly cooked. Very flavourful. Asked my wife Carnitas platter and everything was perfectly done you must try this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was referred to this spot by a fellow Yelper who said its getting great reviews so i had to try it.  They have been open a year so they are still fairly new.  Service was great, as soon as I walked in the door I was greeted warmly and promptly seated. 

Very clean, nice artwork on the walls and Mexican music playing....great atmosphere. My favorite piece of art was the Mexican skeleton lady under the moon.

The Pescado (Fish) tacos were freshly made with great texture and flavors. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food: I ordered the chorizo tres tacos. They came with this zippy, sweet and spicy sauce that i thought was very delicious. They were made with Corn maiz tortillas which i love. The chorizo was perfectly cooked. I also ordered a Pineapple Jarritos.
The service: The service was fantastic. The staff and chef who came out to talk to me was professional and friendly. 
The atmosphere: They had a marriachi playing live music and everyone who talked to me was friendly and welcoming. 
Overall: I loved and enjoyed myself and want to come to this place again. Mexican restaurants and food shops is welcome in beechview in my book."}
{"text":"I had a day to myself when I was in Brampton, so I decided to walk down here for dinner. 

It's really quite awesome! It's got a small storefront on Queen Street W, but the inside is pretty large. I went inside and it was a little on the busy side, so it took a little bit while for me to get seated. There were two large (8+) tables dominating the restaurant at the time I was there, so the service was a little bit spotty.

Anyhow, I started out with queso fundido, which was really great -- nice and gooey and salty with chorizo. 

For main, I decided to have the Cochinita Pibil, which was incredible. It was really tender and full of flavor. It comes with a nice amount of soft corn tortillas, which were nicely warm, as well as some rice and beans as a side. Everything was really great and high quality.

The beer selection was OK -- mostly the macros and some Mexican beers, all in bottles. 

This was for sure one of the best Mexican places I've been to in the GTA. It's totally a hidden gem, get here if you can!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't come off as a restaurant that would turn out good food but maaaann what a surprise! We ordered several items from the menu that included the fish taco's which were outstanding. We also had homemade refried beans (one of my fav's) that was delicious & the Guac was clearly house made & scrumptious as well. They also had some house-made flavoured water that was very interesting & tasty. We ordered way too much food but everything was great. This is a definite do-over!"}
{"text":"Have been hoping for an authentic Mexican restaurant outside of Downtown Toronto for some time now.  Finally found this hidden gem in the heart of Brampton.  We ordered way too much food, but wanted to try multiple items on the menu.  Started with the queso fundido w/ chorizo...loved!  Then had the pozole (mexican soup)....got the large bowl which was big enough to be a main dish.....came with all the fixins.  Then we had the Puntas de Res (grilled beef mixed with jalapeno, onion and tomatoes) which came with a healthy portion of rice and beans.  Everything tasted amazing, and made me homesick for Texas.  Cannot wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"We are visiting Pittsburgh from the eastern shore of MD and found this cozy little place just a short walk away. The owners and staff are amazing. The food delicious and atmosphere fun.  All five of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  We started with chips, salsa, and guacamole. The salsa was some of the best we ever had. It was so fresh and flavorful. The guacamole was delicious and a hearty portion provided. The sauces were the key to the meals. All of them had a subtle blend of flavors and just enough heat. I had the enchiladas verdes and they were perfect. My friend had the enchiladas mole and the sauce was so smooth with the right hint of chocolate and spice. The guys had shrimp tacos and Tacos dorados. All very tasty.  Not sure if we will ever get back this way, but if we do we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am so in love with this little place!  The staff are sweet, the food was great,  and the prices made us want to try everything on the menu (brought lots to go). The place is BYOB, so we brought a few to enjoy with our meal.  The food gets better every time I go in!  Must try the the deserts (got ALL of them our first time in). They also have a few specialty drinks that were amazing!"}
{"text":"I loved how cute and Mexican this little place is. The food was delicious, authentic, and prices were excellent. I'm never in the area but I will probably come back just to eat here."}
{"text":"So this place recently opened up in the former location that was the crested duck. It's a place that reflects the changing demographic of the neighborhood. That being said it's a Mexican restaurant not a Tex-Mex it's Mexican real Mexican the server was pleasant the place is warm and inviting. It's a family resteraunt which I love. I spent 7 years making Tex-Mex and spent several years living in Dallas so I know the difference. This is real Mexican the first time we ate their we had cactus and it was delicious. This place deserves our support and you get a delicious meal to go with it. So if your looking for something different than taco bell give this place a try. O and they also offer some of the Tex-Mex fare for those less adventurous."}
{"text":"Location:  Brampton's theatre district.

Parking:  Street parking OR just North of the restaurant, hang a left and park underground in the Blue-P, underneath the Brampton Civic Centre.

Atmosphere:  Casual, quiet on a Saturday lunch.  Mind you, it was also quite cold outside.  Tables were decorated with colourful, Mexican weaved cloths.  I'm guessing that they catch the theatre-goers and lunch crowd for the people who work nearby.

Instead of the standard tortilla chips with salsa, some decorative \"fried-dough\" was presented at the table with 2 different types of salsas.  (If you're Chinese, they tasted like non-shrimpy 'ha peen'.)  Warning:  Both salsas had a kick to it!

My table ordered different things so we can get a sampling of the menu.  Sadly, I never tasted either the burrito or the platter!  Food was too quickly devoured.  

I was surprised for the value that was being provided for the food.  Either that, or I'm too used to being ripped off at other Mexican places!  For example, the Platters arrived on quite a large dish, complete with beans (NOT from a can!), a serving of rice (much fresher looking than any other place that I've been to), a scoop of guac, side salad, protein, & 2 accompanying either flour/corn tortillas all for $10 (lunch).  I thought that this was exceptional value!

If you're hungry and there for lunch, I'd suggest either the burrito (no rice inside) OR the platter.  3 tacos ($9 for cochinita pibil, a pulled pork) was the the smaller portion of the 3 choices.

One thing to keep in mind is that since everything is freshly made, the refried beans for example, they're going to be 'wetter' looking.  Same goes for the proteins.

Try their made-in-house drinks.  Horchata ($2) was really good!

Prices are better value for lunch, but looks like there's TONS more options for dinner service!  Plus they serve pozole during weekend dinners.  Will definitely be back, too bad it's a bit of a distance."}
{"text":"Like all places, there are pros and cons.  For me, the pros highly outweigh the cons.  

Cons: they were out of chicken.  Fine by me, that's not what I wanted to order,  but if my wife wanted chicken we would have  been screwed.  Good thing she was in a fish taco kind of mood.
Also, service staff is slightly inattentive.  Not rude or insulting, just inattentive.

Pros:  fantastic food.  Largest fish tacos I've ever had (and I've had them coast to coast in US and Canada- they're usually my go to). Quantity matched quality- light flaky fish, well seasoned and battered.  Optimum crispness to contrast the moist fish.  Topped with a  great slaw.  They forgot my limes, but they were brought once requested.
Octopus tacos were EXCELLENT.  Not overcooked (as octopus more often times than not, is).  Slightly salty, but very flavourful and satisfying.  
CORN TORTILLAS.  I cannot stress this enough- if you're serving tacos and your only option is a flour tortilla, then you need to re-evaluate something.  This place serves them on corn tortillas.  I'm a happy guy.

This place has earned a high rating from me and is truly a gem in Brampton's somewhat lacking foodie scene."}
{"text":"It was a great place to eat, the food, atmosphere and service was all excellent. The food was fresh, the chorrus were the best I have ever tasted - try the butterscotch dip with it. The only downside (is the portion is small, but the quality makes up for it). I would highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Showed up at 8:20 on Tuesday only to find the place closed! The hours on here AND on their website indicate they are open until 9!!! Made the trip all of the way from Toronto for this. What Mexican restaurant is closed on TACO TUESDAY?!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. 

We got to the restaurant around 9, and enjoy the last of the live music. The place was packed!

We had tacos and they were heavenly! It did take some time to get served, but it was definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food, very friendly owner. Reasonable prices and it's BYOB with liquor store right up the street. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I usually find Mexican food to be satisfying, but it rarely wows me. But my first meal at this unassuming spot has me grinning - great menu, but the attention to each dish got me to a wow. The fried fish tacos are amongst the best I've ever had; zucchini salad is a clever side; and the guacamole is a chunky, nonstandard version that shows how thoughtful this kitchen is. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I'm always complaining about the lack of Latin food in the gta. So when I saw this place pop up on my yelp feed I had to try it. I decided to stop here after work and check it out. The waitress helped me navigate through the menu and pick a few things out. She was super nice and throughout the time I was waiting I saw her going for table to table checking up on the customers. I asked her about the juice jugs labelled jamaica and tamarindo and she gave me a generous sample of each. Jamaica is is a hibiscus drink with fruity and floral undertones. Looks like Jamaican sorrel but doesn't taste like it (imo) Tamarindo taste exactly like tamarind balls ( not sure if people eat them outside if the West Indies) a perfect balance of sweet and sour. I decided to try chicken tinga taco, picadillo ( beef) taco, pescado (fish) taco, churros and pineapple empanada. Everything tasted good but nothing blew my socks off. You can tell they make everything fresh from scratch. The food is a little more bland than I expected. The desserts were perfect. They make an amazing salsa to top your tacos! Can't wait to go back for dinner and try more items off the menu (especially the tres Leche cake!)"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with La Carnita! The tacos are pretty much perfect in my eyes. So far I've tried the beef cheek, pork and cod. All of them were 10 out of 10. They are all so flavorful and definitely satisfying. I would suggest ordering 2 tacos at a time they are usually pretty filling. As a choice for appetizers I've tried the salsa and guacamole which was pretty good. And the churro were all very delicious. Also if you are a Cesar drinker you absolutely need to have their Cesars, probably one of the best I've had in a long time. Overall la Carnita is absolutely mouth watering and will definitely keep you coming back for more! The only down fall is the insanely ridiculous wait times for a table, however I've down right when they open around 5:30/6 and was able to be seated right away. So come early and you'll be thankful you did."}
{"text":"this place has great reviews, so of course i had to try it. Also i'm a taco fanatic at the moment. i'm looking for a \"seven lives\" close to home, but this ain't it. took a while for us to even get noticed at the door, i wasn't sure if i should seat myself or what. After 5 more minutes of standing i decided to seat myself. after 5 more minutes we got menus. i went in there for tacos and tacos is all i ordered. I have shrimp, grilled fish and fried fish. My BF had the Acapulco, the octopus, and the steak. mine were okay, so much onion, and so much spinach. Spinach on everything. My favourite one of course was the fried fish had more flavor. My bf liked his octopus but the steak was very plain, just meat. Also, they don't double the shell like all other places i have been recently going to. So of course as i grab to put each one in my mouth they break open. i expected better yelpers."}
{"text":"--Epic service
--Amazing food
--Great prices, generous portions
--It's a cute spot for some authentic food"}
{"text":"Place wasn't clean, cutlery was dirty. Servers weren't really helpful. It was our first time eating authentic Mexican food and our waitress wasn't the least bit interested in helping us understand the menu. Went with 3 other people and all of our meals were extremely sour. I had the enchiladas in salsa Verde, and the others had the chicken with rice platter. There was no other flavor other than sour. The all you can eat chips and salsa were good to have considering we ate very little of everything else."}
{"text":"3.5 Star

Mexican Food in Brampton?! Or more specifically Acupulco Mexican Food?

La Catrina has this little cozy homey vibe atmosphere. We were greeted by the Owner/Cook and which I asked tons of questions about the menu and asked for recommnendation. 

We shared:

Vuelve a la vida \"Back to life\"  ($11) - Shrimp, Fish and Octopus mixed with tomato
sauce, chopped tomato, onion and cilantro
- Octopus so tender, love the use of tomato sauce which made it more like a refreshing cold soup!

Cochinita Pibil ($10) - Shredded Pork meat, marinated with 12 different spices and cooked in the oven for 8 hrs, topped with pickled red onion
- Good value for the portion! The pork is tender 
 
Pescado (Fish) Tacos ($7) - Beer batter Basa Fish, topped with a Mango Orange coleslaw salad, Chipotle mayonnaise and Fresh Cilantro.
- Love the mango orange coleslaw topping and the fish is fresh with a good texture. I don't really like the batter though, a little heavy for me.

For our happy ending we shared Tres Leches cake, which is moist and light with the right amount of sweetness. The highlight of our lunch!

La Catrina might not have the most fancy or amazing Mexican food but definitely a gem in Brampton. A great neighbourhood restaurant for some authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"La Catrina is permanently closed as of Dec 2017.  I read that they lost their liquor licence at some point in 2017 and weren't able to keep the business open on food alone."}
{"text":"I love me some tacos and this place is pretty good for their fish tacos . Anything else isn't that great. The fish in the fish tacos are huge , they don't skimp at all . The beef and chicken aren't that great and the few times I've had the rice and beans plate you could tell it wasn't fresh.  If your looking for some great fish tacos place I would recommend it ."}
{"text":"I'm not a very large fan of Mexican food but this place really impressed me. I'm from Brampton and if you know anything about Brampton, you know that there isn't a lot around here, however, this place is a hidden gem. You should try this place out. The place is lively with live music and the servers were really great as well. Will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"One word, DISAPPOINTED.

So here it goes..

It was a Saturday evening around 6pm when my friend and I walked into La Catrina and it was busy. I was like, \"YES! This is great!\" 
I felt the restaurant was kind of hot and stuffy.. Was not comfortable at all. 

We had received the complimentary nachos, which were good but a tad bit oily for my liking. 

After looking at the menu, my friend and I had finally decided.
- Shrimp Ceviche.
- Chicken Tinga.
- Fish Tacos.

The ceviche was too watery! Just felt it was tossed together. Also, they gave us crackers?! I've never had crackers with ceviche before! I felt like the ceviche was more like a tomato soup with canned green olives and a few pieces of shrimp.

The chicken tingas I can't speak for other than my friend didn't finish them.

The fish tacos had NO FLAVOUR!! 
I know my fish tacos because I always order fish tacos at any Mexican joint.
It was either, 
A) The oil to fry the fish wasn't hot enough.
B) It's been sitting around.

The batter was VERY oily! It didn't even seem to have any seasoning at all. I wish it came with complimentary piece of lime or lemon so we could squeeze it onto the fish taco, kinda give it a lil kick.

As for the service, kind of seem disorganized but the girls were very nice and did their best.

Would I return? Most likely no."}
{"text":"I was in Brampton for the day and was taken to La Catrina by a friend who's parents raved about the food. Since we were all in the mood for Mexican food, we drove to the heart of downtown Brampton to try it out.

We arrived around 5:00pm on a Saturday evening. There is street parking available right next to the restaurant but you need to pay for parking Monday-Saturday up until 6pm (street parking is free on Sunday). 

For a 5pm on a Saturday evening, we weren't expecting there to be many people but it was half full when we arrived. We were promptly seated and were given a basket of freshly made and fried tortilla chips with two types of dip. They were the BEST tortilla chips I've ever had and I wish I could have brought some home. After going through the menu, we ordered our drinks (unfortunately, they didn't offer margaritas) and food and nibbled away at the rest of our tortilla chips.

We had ordered two orders of suizas and a beef platter. The Suizas were so tasty and the portions were a good size for what you were paying. It came with four wraps and I only finished 2. Admittedly, I did have a good portion of those chips mentioned earlier..

I couldn't leave without ordering some churros so I took some to go. The churros were A-MA-ZING. I've always been a huge fan of churros and each order came with 3. It was obvious that they were freshly made so it was delicious! Not too sweet and not too strong on the cinnamon. Highly recommended!

The staff and ambience of the environment made you feel like you weren't in Brampton. They were so friendly and would give you suggestions based on your taste buds. They even told us that every weekend they had live music at 7pm so I am highly considering going back just to have another delicious dinner accompanied with beautiful music and performances. 

Overall, I had a fantastic experience at La Catrina and am so glad that we decided to stop by. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Save your dinero . My boyfriend and I checked out this place based on a good review wrote by reddit , identifying them as a new gem in Brampton that is a must see. I would disagree, best way to sum it up is this restaurant is the equivalent to burrito boys. The ambience is inviting and warm, with tons of Mexican decor , giving it a great cultural experience . The service was 4/10, waited a long time to be served. We ordered guacamole, fish and beef tacos with two soft drinks . The fish tacos were good, cooked and garnished well, perfectly crispy and tasty. The beef taco, was extremely bland and boring , and lastly the guacamole was a small ,traditional and chunky portion-overall tasty and unique .This estashblishmet does not serve alcohol, which would definitely shape this place much better .The bill was $50, personally I feel that it was overpriced based on the portions, quality and experience received. Overall 2.5/5."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I stopped in here for lunch and I can definitely say we will be back...Often!  This two-family run restaurant offers some of the best authentic Mexican food I have ever tasted.  
The staff is very friendly, even giving us Spanish lessons so we could properly pronounce some of the items on the menu.  The service is very quick and the price is is very reasonable.
Additional spices are also offered for those of us who like a little 'kick' to the taste buds!"}
