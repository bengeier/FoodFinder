{"text":"Very fast delivery, everything tasted wonderful and was hot. The driver was very polite and thanked me. Very reasonable prices. I have definatly found a new favorite."}
{"text":"We love this place. We order at least once a week and typically have it delivered. It's always hot and the food is delicious.   We have a family of four which includes two grown boys. We order quite a variety of dishes. I'm not a big fan of the bone in ribs but will try the boneless soon. Love the egg rolls. Wonton egg drop soup is the best I've had. Thai noodle and Singapore noodles are two family faves. Love the general Tso's and lo mein."}
{"text":"Good restaurant, friendly staff and big portions. Only reason for 3 stars is that I'm a huge sesame chicken fan and recently move to the area, but unfortunately it was over breaded, flavor was decent though. Spicy honey chicken was also good but a little over breaded."}
{"text":"All I can do is compare this place to Seinfeld's Soup Nazi. We just moved in to the area and wanted to get some good Chinese food for the family. I looked on line and found the menu for Asian Grill. They had the typical specials by number. So I ordered by number. when I got the food home I unpacked it and my two Mongolian beefs were Mongolian chicken. I called to complain about the mixed up and was told by the young lady that she repeated the order and I accepted it. I reiterated that I ordered by number so the mistake could not have been mine. I went in a short time later and talked to the owner and explained the situation. Not sure if he understood everything I was saying but the other gals standing there sure did. I told him I didn't want any free food, I just wanted him to understand that she should not have argued with a customer. I ate here two times since then without incident. Good food Good service. Tonight my wife decided she wanted Chinese so I called to ask if they had Peanut Chicken. I was having a hard time hearing the gal on the other line so I said I would call back. I tried to call several time but every time I dialed they picked up and hung up. I thought they were having phone trouble. My wife dialed from her phone and they explained that we were no longer welcome there. My wife chuckled and asked why? The young girl stated that it was because of \"what happened at my last visit\". As I mentioned we had been there two times since the bad experience. I explained this to the gal and she said that they no longer could service us....NO SOUP FOR YOU!!!...lol What kind of nut ball operates a business like this? THUMBS DOWN for Asian Grill....Plenty of other great Chinese restaurants out there folks...I'll make sure I let everyone I know about how you treat people."}
{"text":"Delivery took a while, but I can understand. Food was really good for delivery entry's. Great family's special value price. Must have patience with whoever is answering phones and taking orders, can be a little difficult placing one but worth it at the end."}
{"text":"Please don't eat at or order from this restaurant.  We placed an online order, but they delivered the wrong entr√©e.  When we called and asked that they deliver the correct food, they absolutely refused to make it right and even accused us of lying.  Also, frankly, the food isn't even that good.  There are far better and much more honest Chinese restaurants in the immediate area.  We'd recommend Chens on Riggs and McQueen."}
{"text":"I have been searching for the best Chinese food in Chandler.  I've tried several, but most foods on the menu are too sweet.  I was searching for the kind of Chinese food I had as a girl in my hometown of Hanford, CA.  The chow mein was in a white sauce on top of crispy noodles.  I've heard it called NY style.  Asian Grill, in the Basha's shopping area, on Riggs Rd, almost has it right.  They will make any of the chow meins with the white sauce, only they put the crispy noodles on top rather than under.  I usually bring a ziplock bag of my own crispy noodles to add more.  Their egg drop soup is the best I've ever had and the fried rice is wonderful.  I've never had delivery to the house so can't comment.  Asian Grill faces Alma School rather than Riggs Rd."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast delivery; not sure how they delivered so fast, but delivery driver was awesome! Food was super hot. You HAVE to try the Coconut Shrimp."}
{"text":"Always excellent. Have never had a bad meal from Asian Grill.  Food is fresh and prepared properly   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Our go to Asian in Waxhaw. Both take-out and dine in are excellent. Bonus when dining in is chatting with May who is the owner. Everything  is always so fresh and authentic!  Love the Singapore noodles!!!"}
{"text":"Always excellent! Asian Garden is a little gem!  This family (the owners) are kind, helpful, hardworking, accommodating & fast, no fluency in English here - so give them a break! My favorites Chicken Curry, Mongolian Beef, & any of the Soups. Stop by or call in a order & Enjoy!  They deliver lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the delivery service is outstanding.  They handle everything with a smile. We've eaten our way through the menu and haven't found anything that wasn't good."}
{"text":"By far, this place exceeds any of the Asian restaurants we have dined at.  The food is VERY fresh and piping hot when served.  Prices are great and the service has always been impeccable.  It is our only GO TO Asian diner.  Recently got their beer/wine license and that makes it even BETTER!  Keep up the good work, Asian Grill."}
{"text":"First time and it was OK.  Won-Ton soup was very good.  Sesame chicken and sweet-sour chicken didn't have too much flavor.  The two people on the register were not very friendly, one person on his phone texting so I guess I was disturbing him, however one of the male servers came to the register and was very nice."}
{"text":"The hubs and I stopped in for lunch. I had the Bang Bang Chicken lunch special with rice. I did ask for and add some extra chili pepper sauce because I like my Asian food spicy. The service was fast too! We will be back...that sauce is addictive!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! This place is awesome! I was at work and decided to place an order for take-out.... Which is really convenient since it is about a 5 minute drive up the road. I am all about garlic chicken, and decided to order their lunch special. Only $5.75 for a whole lot of food! I went in to pick up my order and was greeted with a warm smile... It was as if they already knew who I was. My order was ready immediately... And it was delicious!! This place gets 5 stars for their amazing service and for the food! I will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Asian Grill is fantastic! The food is always fresh and the service is great.  You can tell they are into the customer experience."}
{"text":"Five stars for service! The lady taking my order was was so sweet. It was my first time in and she helped me choose what to order. I really was craving chicken stir fried with Asian veggies, and rhat is SO hard to find!  The chicken with vegetables was very tasty and had a great selection of veggies. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The bottom line is that this Chinese food is the best around! We have ordered takeout many times, eaten in a couple of times, and we have never been disappointed!  We will continue to order the great food here and recommended it highly!  You need to let them know if you want extra hot mustard and/or hot pepper oil, but just ask, and they will take care of you."}
{"text":"I stand by my first review. I was hoping to give this place another chance but afraid to do so. Someone named Caleb sent me a nasty inbox message on Yelp. He said that he is not the owner but only has one review and it's for the Asian Grill. I never knew of a customer being so defensive and offensive so I would assume he is the owner. See picture"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese in the Waxhaw area! I love that the meat is fresh, and that it looks and tastes like what it's supposed to! I haven't had anything there yet that I don't like. A family favorite is the Flower Chicken. My family has also had the egg foo young, four happiness, beef with broccoli, and many other dishes. The service is friendly, and extra bonus - they have a 100% sanitation rating!"}
{"text":"Always great service and the freshest ingredients, this place is a local favorite. I love the food and they give generous portions! Lots of options, and good prices. I've been going here for years and never tire of it."}
{"text":"1 hour and 45 minutes delivery. (Microphone drop) We are so disappointed. The food is okay. I do not recommend. It may be better if it was warm on delivery. Maybe pick up would be a better option if you are looking for 'good' Chinese."}
{"text":"Their food has been ok for delivery, and we love our delivery. But even that won't cover bad costumer service!!  Tonight was the last straw, and it was a pick up order.   If their food was great, I would suck it up, but it is no where near great to deal with rude. Better off sticking with Pei Wei."}
{"text":"I've only tried this place once, but have to give it a five for service and food. I ordered delivery online because I'm a lazy hermit. They delivered in about 45 minutes. The delivery guy said that I was actually out of their delivery radius, so I felt bad but they were nice enough to bring me my food to my doorstep anyway. Thanks guys! I have typical white girl food sensibilities, so I'm not into funky dark meat chicken with random connective tissue and such. None of that in sight here -- just fresh tasting white meat, fresh veg, no radioactive-orange sweet and sour sauce. I will definitely get in my car and drive for this food next time! Best I've had in the area."}
{"text":"I stopped by tonight and ordered the beef with broccoli.  I thought it was a little pricey ($9.83 w. tax), BUT the entree was excellent.  This is kind of a \"hole in the wall\" type of restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food.  And the size of the serving was enough for two meals.  Am looking forward to finishing it off for lunch tomorrow.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"After ordering one general tsaos chicken and a side of crab puffs for delivery 2 hours passed and my food still never came. I called several times and got different stories on the whereabouts of the driver. First they said he will be leaving soon then immediately after that said the driver left 8mins ago. Finally I decided to cancel my order and have my money refunded back on to my card they assured me it would be done my 9pm. Another 2hrs passed and 9pm rolls around still no refund on my card and now they are not answering my calls, Im assuming they are closed for the evening. The next morning I proceeded to try and follow up again about my money still no answer still no refund. Very poor customer service and accountability. Never got a chance to try their food and from my first impression I will not consider it."}
{"text":"Just picked up my  \"food\".  With all these transplants moving into the Waxhaw area I would think the reviews would be more accurate. Been here twice.  Simply put its a disappointment.  No flavor."}
{"text":"OMG! Best crab rangoons i have ever had. I am from Chicago and i was visiting my mom. She recommended the place and i was thoroughly impressed. In Chicago when you get crab rangoon there is like one squirt of filling and the rest is the fried dough. Here they are filled to the max and utterly delish! The veggie lo mein was pretty good.  Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I am Chinese.  To get a OK, 3 star from me is not a bad thing.  Dishes are on the too saucy and too salty side for me, but the portion is generous enough.  Ingredients are fresh.   Good for take out as the establishment is not a fancy place.  I will order from this place again, but ask them to reduce sauce...."}
{"text":"Great food and great delivery!   Not Chinese cuisine but really good when too tired to cook or go out.   The chicken fried rice -spicy, is really tasty!  My son's favorite is the honey chicken.  Try it soon!"}
{"text":"I got delivery orange chicken and lo mein the food here is wonderful I have had it for dining before. The delivery driver Jim was a very nice guy I was very impressed with him he got to our house very quickly and was very polite out the door great employed to have around."}
{"text":"Perfect example of a group of people so desperate for Chinese food that they actually eat here and rate this place above a 1 star.   REALLY PEOPLE?!?!? Explore the world some and learn what good Chinese food is.   The place is filthy. From the floors to the seats to the tables to the doors to the walls. You are welcomed with the over powering smell of what the...is that the smell of food poisoning??? There is grease in the air. This place is just nasty.   The crab puffs were nasty and they serve you the dipping sauces in a plastic container for one person yet you have 6 puffs to share with 4 people.   They have no alternatives to soda other than water. No milk. No juice. They apparently ran out of ice tea....WHAT THE???? Tea is 90% of your business.   Let's see they also served the appetizers after the entrees and by the time I got the plastic cups of sauce the puffs were cold.   The meat was animal grade quality grizzle and fat in the beef. Chicken was hacked up with tendons and ligaments. Steamed veggies were steamed to goo. Fried meats were soggy.   The only thing that was good was the water...perhaps it was the slight taste of tap water chlorine that made it refreshing...it certainly was the cleanest thing in this restaurant.   Go somewhere else people!!!! I'm going home to  shower and vomit!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in town.  I eat here once a week.  Delivery is a little slow but just call an hour before you want your food."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed our food there, and the waiters have always been very friendly. Love to support family owned businesses."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this Chinese place. It's not to oily and the food is always delicious. The delivery is very fast as well. Great for a night you don't want to cook or go out!"}
{"text":"this little hole in the wall can really change how you feel about chinese food. all white meat chicken , No fat in their meats, and to top it off no MSG. the owner beautifully remodeled the restaraunt and gave it just a so much fuller experience for dine in. and while the staff can at sometimes be very hard to understand and come off as rude they provide a wonderful meal. and delivery only being a dollar more (2 dollars if your outside their 5 mile range) its very hard to beat. i urge anyone withing a 7 mile radius to give it a shot."}
{"text":"Meh. Tastes exactly like the place out by me in the Falls. Rice really isn't fried. Fresh food. Quick and friendly service. It will do. I just wish a place would break out of the mold and do their own thing. Instead of what everyone else is doing....... but that's just me.  Not complaining, just looking for something different personally."}
{"text":"Asian Grill is close by and acceptable compared to the dearth of good Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood. I like the vegetable egg foo young and honey chicken."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving. It located in the corner of the strip mall in the Bashas' shopping center.  Do give this place a try!  The owners are awesome, and their attention to detail does not go unnoticed.  Fresh ingredients, great taste, definitely a go to Chinese place in south Chandler.     I have been working my way through the menu over the past few weeks and have yet to find anything that I didn't like"}
{"text":"Went there on Christmas night and it was super busy... could tell that this place has awesome food! And indeed they have great food!"}
{"text":"While they have seating for 30 some this is primarily a take out place with great food."}
{"text":"Very polite and prompt service and decent prices, but food quality was comparable to Panda Express. I would have given them 3 stars except they don't know how to cook rice! I have yet to find one great Chinese restaurant in the entire valley! There's great Thai, Indian and Mexican food here, but no Chinese!"}
{"text":"Standard Americanized Chinese food here.  I don't see what people are getting so excited about.  I have been to this place over 10 times the last 7 months or so.  The food has never been bad but its never been great as far as I am concerned.  This restaurant is really the only Chinese restaurant in the Sun Lakes area."}
{"text":"I would give 4 stars for good quality except that SEVERAL times the veggies, especially the zucchini, has had an overwhelming pesticide or hairspray taste which scares me.  My husband and I both think they may be using an industrial cleaner on their pots and pans instead of one made for food prep.  If that isn't it then I am not sure what it is.  We reported this to the American delivery driver but he did not seem to give it much credence.  Too bad because they offer some of the most well prepared Asian food in the area.  I wish they would fix this problem!"}
{"text":"Once again, I am very impressed with Asian Grill. First and foremost, they consistently maintain a very high health grade - 98.  Their lowest score ever was still 97.5, in May 2016!    The service is great and so is their food! I had Crispy Duck with white rice, and salad with very tasty ginger dressing.  My husband had Sa Cha Chicken with fried rice.   On a previous visit, I ordered a to-go order of extra spicy mei fun which was extremely good."}
{"text":"Asian Grill is our new favorite place to go for Asian food. Mei, the owner is SO friendly and accommodating.  The food is always amazing and the prices are very reasonable. Love that it's local and family owned. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food we've found in the Greater Charlotte Area!  It's fresh...and the potstickers are the best I've had since moving here.  SO happy we finally found our spot.  We did takeout and it was yummy all the way around.  Well flavored and good selections of chicken!  The Moo Shu Pork was great - even better the next day!"}
{"text":"I used Yelp Eat24 to order my food. Service was quicker than anticipated response time. We ordered 9 different dishes. My family is a little picky about Chinese food because of their exposure to this ethnic cuisine for years.  Orange chicken, lemon chicken, sweet sour pork, beef broccoli, shrimp tempura and fried rice were good. The crispy one ton is different, little meat in it. The noodles need some sprucing up, egg fu young was a little dry."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service and probably the best Asian food in the area. Their sanitation rating is always very high.  This is really a hidden gem"}
{"text":"First visit here on recommendation of friends. So impressed by the service and the food. This place is a gem and better than any Asian restaurant in the area. Certainly will return and no more trips to P.F. Chang's. No reason to leave hungry."}
{"text":"Yeah, I know.  Sun Lakes?    Being that I work relatively close to this area, I'm no stranger to the lunch menu at Asian Grill.  My 'ol standby is the Spicy Honey Chicken.  Sesame Chicken is good as is General Tso.  Is that the trifecta of standard Americanized Chinese chicken dishes?  If so, these guys are cranking these items out perfectly.  It's good to note, and they do so on the menu, that Asian Grill only uses white meat when it comes to chicken.  No mysterious dark parts.  For some reason, I find this reassuring.  Lunch specials will run you about $6 plus a cup of hot tea for fifty cents or so.  It's not spendy at all.    I'd agree with the only other person who reviewed this place that the hot and sour soup is truly wonderful.  Small place, somewhat cramped seating but it's rarely over capacity when I visit.  It's a good place to not be seen if your operating on the down low.  Very incognito.  On top of that it's right next to a Bashas' so you can pick up whatever you need, if you need whatever.  Ha."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gotten take-out twice now. Pretty good food and the staff is always very friendly. We will definitely continue to go back. Prices are extremely reasonable and order has never been wrong."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place last weekend.  What a find!  Food was fabulous.  Fresh, fresh, fresh!  Cooked to perfection.  Sauce was outstanding.  Everything home made and perfect.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great quality ingredients and delicious too!  Love the shrimp and vegetables.  Very nice staff."}
{"text":"All I can say is that we will never order from this establishment again!  I called ahead and ordered for a pickup and my husband stopped on time on his way home from work and stood at the counter for 10 minutes and no one acknowledged him. So, he walked out.  I called and spoke with Asian women and she could care less about my complaint.  If she was a smart business women she would have offered us a free delivery or something to resolve our frustration."}
{"text":"Found a new gem in Waxhaw.  My new favorite place. Excellent food and service!!!! Dinner was so good and fresh!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice so far, purposely getting different dishes so we can try more things. They are all really good! My husband is pretty picky about all food in general and he loved all of it. The lettuce wraps are sooo good, highly recommended! We will be back often, I am sure!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service! I ordered wontons (meaning cream cheese rangoons) and they delivered fried wontons. I called to see what happened, and they delivered me crab rangoons within 20 minutes and didn't charge for the wontons. They didn't have to do that, because after all, it was my communication error. They also have much better Asian food than anyone in town. I will definitely make this my go to take out place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the better Asian restaurants in the area. Their food is fresh and flavorful. I ordered the moo shu chicken, crab puffs, and vegetable eggroll. Their food is so tasty. I will definitely continue to return and recommend to anyone that lives in the area."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Fresh and tasty.  Not many Asian restaurants have a consistently high rating - on my recent visit - a 99 sanitation rating !! Impressive.  The egg rolls are simple, fresh and crunchy - yet not greasy. The hibachi lunch special is great .  They have brown rice as an option, which I appreciate.  Try this little gem - you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Nice take away.  In a plaza next to Sears.  Nice selection.  Friendly staff.  Food is good."}
{"text":"Came in after church around 11:30. Place is spotless and has a sanitation grade of 100. Always good to see! Our server was polite and attentive. The food came out quickly and was nice and hot, and definitely freshly made. My husband had ordered the dinner portion and they had made a lunch size instead, and both the chef and server came over to apologize for the additional two minute wait. Everything was delicious and I would absolutely go back again!"}
{"text":"Went here this past weekend while visiting sun lakes.  Worst idea we had all trip.   The family that owns and runs it must work hard because they were all there and the place was busy.  The food is just not good.  We got Coconut Shrimp, Orange Chicken, Pork Fried Rice, and egg rolls.  Orange chicken is soggy and pork fried rice was gamy...  The pork was super overcooked and gross.  My brother and I both had half of a plate and called it good...  We were rummaging the cabinets an hour later but neither of us could stomach the idea of more of this gross food."}
{"text":"We've ordered several items from here and everything we've tried has been good.  We live a little outside of their delivery area, but they've accommodated us and yay! Delivery!  The food arrives within 45 minutes or So and is still hot."}
{"text":"Found this one by accident. We weren't even looking for Asian cuisine this night.   However, What a very pleasant surprise.   My wife, daughter and I feel this is one of the best Asian restaurants in the area. The owners were incredibly friendly and attentive. The food was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, I had the pepper steak with wonton soup, brown rice, won ton, egg roll and ice tea, all excellent all for under 10 bucks"}
{"text":"We're new to South Chandler and back in Los Angeles, we had some amazing Chinese restaurants, especially in China Town. We've tried almost every Chinese restaurant south of the 202, and by far, Asian Grill is the best we've found. Food is consistent, not over seasoned, and actually puts heat in their dishes marked with a little red chili pepper icon.  One of our go to dishes at any Chinese Restaurant is Orange Chicken and General Tsao's Chicken. Every place we tried in South Chandler served chicken coated in mushy batter. No texture or crunch. When we tried these dishes at AG, the fry on the batter was perfectly crips, even on delivery orders.   Their noodles are cooked al dente, vegetables still have snap and haven't been cooked to death, fried rice doesn't skimp on the protein or egg, unlike a lot of the other places.  If you're looking for a fancy, upscale Chinese restaurant, this isn't the place. This is good old mom and pop Chinese food. Portions are good size for the price too.  Give it a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I like these guys!  They make good food, and are very friendly.  We like to order off their website, since you can easily use coupons that way.  We order he about once a month and their food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Quick place for lunch at reasonable price.  We started with won ton soup, an extra .50 to the lunch special. It was tasteless but included fresh veggies which I liked.  My chicken was spicy but not too spicy.  Loved the white meat and sauce.  My husband's special beef was breaded, like they ordered from Cisco and microwaved and then put a sauce on top.  Not our favorite.  If you decide to stop by the Asian Grill, order something they make up fresh."}
{"text":"After reading all the other existing reviews for Asian Grill, I think I have a legit sense of understanding towards why this place gets 1-5 reviews (and everything in between).   Trust me when I say that Asian Grill is a great place for lunch on a weekday. Its not good for large groups, or bday parties, or dinner, or date nights or any of that crap. Its excellent for going outside the office for lunch, eating a good meal and then continuing with your work for the remaining of the day. Its not meant to be a dining experience; its meant to be a dining convenience.   And let me explain why: You come in, the menu is already at the counter, you select your combo (soup, lunch plate and a beverage for about $5.45) and pay up front. You fix your own drink, you find a seat, blink, and your plates come up pretty immediately after.  Unless you have super-powers at eating, you box up whatever you didn't finish and peace out - all in about 20mins or so (total in-out).   With this (hopefully new) perspective, let me justify my 4 stars for Asian Grill. Simply put: the food is plentiful and although a little greasy, great in flavor and quality. The staff is very friendly, the food comes out SUPER fast and the prices are extremely do-able for what you get. My beef dish was very tasty and the wanton soup was hot and flavorful. I won't go into an over-elaborate description of the food look and feel, because y'all know how standard american/Chinese food tastes like: better than Panda Express, worse than legit Chinese food. Done."}
{"text":"We have had both lunch and dinner here several times now and the food is consistently delicious, served hot and fast.   There is an abundance of choices on the menu. I love that they offer white and brown rice. The spring and egg roles are fabulous and not at all greasy like a lot of places. My kids especially like the teriyaki and the rice bowls.   My favorite dish so far is the Asparagus Twin Delight. The shrimp is cooked perfectly, not overcooked or rubbery and there is plenty of shrimp and chicken in the dish. Not just a couple of pieces of meat with tons of veggies. We always end up taking home a doggie bag then having the rest for lunch the next day.   I placed an order for takeout and it was ready in five minutes! And while they also serve you quickly when you eat in, they don't make you feel rushed to get in and get out. (The dining room is small so at busy times you do need to wait for a table or grab takeout.)  The only thing they could do to improve is add delivery! One of the rare things I miss about living in the northeast."}
{"text":"Very good food and the servings are generous and reasonable. The egg drop soup is the best I've ever had and I ate it all. I usually only have about 1/4 in other places. The delivery was great. We highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Warming up with egg drop soup.,tasty. Ordered the Cantonese Chow Mein (shrimp, chicken and beef in a garlic sauce). For three meats, very little meat. Dish comes with steamed noodles (substituted noodles for steamed rice). Some vegetable are crispy, others tiny corn and mushrooms taste from a can. Menu said jumbo shrimp (more like their dwarf cousins). Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"This place has great food and very good responsive service. The atmosphere is well done, however the dining room is a little small. Can be hard to get a table during peak times but the takeout is awesome. Personal recommendations include the General's white chicken, Pad Thai, Crab Rangoon, and Wonton or Egg Drop Soups. They do not have sushi, but that's not that big of a thing. Worth a trip."}
{"text":"I have ordered here a few times, the food is usually okay, but there's much better options in medina. The service is AWFUL. I've ordered delivery from them and they forget to bring things, and it's really slow. It usually takes almost an hour. Once they forgot egg rolls, and when we called they said they were \"too busy\" to get us them. When they forgot our dumplings, they said \"how do we know you're not lying\" and literally hung up on me, and when I called back and said they hung up on me, they said \"yeah, what do you want\" and then told me I'd have to come to the restaurant and pick them up, and when I got there and expressed we were unhappy with the way she treated me on the phone, she said she never said that and that it was her son I talked to. And they still didn't give us the sauce for them. Terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"The good: The staff was very nice and friendly and the prices were very affordable. The bad:  The restaurant was a little dirty, and the food was not what I was expecting. I ordered the lemon chicken lunch meal,the chicken had a weird texture and off flavor. The fried rice was not fried rice....it was white rice with soy sauce covered all over it. It didn't taste bad but was not what I was expecting. I tried this place because it was recommended by a co-worker, but I will not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Asian Grill is a great restaurant. The garlic chicken is just spicy enough and the food is always hot. Prices are reasonable and delivery is offered."}
{"text":"Great food & delivery was faster than expected.  The portions are generous, and the beef lo mein was just the right balance of smoky and sweet.  They also threw in some little fried noodles as a snack in for free.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed. Their food is sooooo tasty and more importantly, fresh. This is THE only place I order Chinese food. You can put your egg drop soup in the fridge and unlike other places around here, you will not find a cup of oil the next day...still soup! We have ordered several combinations, all have been good. No problem if you order sauce on the side. Egg rolls, delish! Give them a try. The delivery is fast and super nice."}
{"text":"We were looking for another place, got lost, stopped in here. So glad!! I ordered Yummy noodle bowl-YUMMY!! Son ordered Mongolian beef, delish. Sister got sesame chicken. Wait staff was attentive and so friendly."}
{"text":"Restaurant tastefully decorated and clean. The servers were polite and attentive. Ordered chicken chow fun, large portion with very fresh ingredients. They had red chili oil so we could add our own heat.  Red curry chicken with rice was very good with perfect amount of heat. Will be going back to try more items on large menu."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. The entire staff is personable and ensures that you are taken care of. They are so sweet to my son when we eat in - they even give him an extra fortune cookie! Prices are very reasonable for the amount of food provided. You can dine in or take out. They can accommodate large parties. We've tried just about everything on the menu - so order away and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Actually....I would give this place 4.5 stars! Got take out for the first time the other day. The mongolian beef was exceptional, the pork rolls are crispy, and flavorful. The fried rice is made with white meat chicken only, and so tasty! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the area... There are 3 other Chinese restaurants between my home and this location and its worth the drive every time. Portion size never upsets."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! If you like good food, do not come here. We tried & tried this place for a couple of years for convenience but NO GOOD each time. They would not even honor their own coupon that has no expiration date printed."}
{"text":"1.  Super fast delivery.  2. Very nice delivery guy.  3. Piping hot food.  5. Fantastic food.   Asian Grill has another customer"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food!  Great place for lunch. The service was excellent and the meals came out quickly and exactly as requested. The place was very clean. It is an easy place to come for handicapped. They also deliver which we know we will do.  We took a menu home. We will come again."}
{"text":"DELIVERY IN OCOTILLO!!!  ALAS, A BUSINESS GETS THAT I WANT FOOD BROUGHT TO ME!!!!  This place is quick, the food is predictable and good tasting. VERY large portions, I recommend splitting but the food does reheat very well.   We have had the lo mien, teriyaki chicken, beef and broccoli, crab wontons, egg rolls and spring rolls, sweet and sour chicken, ALL WONDERFUL!   They give you lots of sauce, which is awesome. They don't skimp!  Best of all, they are one of the only places around here who will deliver anything besides pizza!! Glad they left a menu on my door!"}
{"text":"Family-owned, friendly, fast and great for takeout or delivery. We order-in from Asian Grill at least once a month, if not more, but have never actually dined at the restaurant, though the tables are often crowded, so our reliance on this great Chandler/Sun Lakes fave for takeout shouldn't stop you from dining in.  The very first time I walked in the restaurant to pick up a menu, a woman waiting in line for her pickup order went out of her way to tell me, \"You have to try the hot-and-sour soup; it's the best ever!\" That's pretty high praise, as I've eaten in Chinatown in both LA and New York. Turns out, her recommendation was spot-on, which explains why Asian Grill is selling it's amazing soup all year around... even in Arizona during the summer.  Our typical order includes the soup or the equally impressive tempura shrimp apetizer, which are huge (and soooo tasty), the cashew chicken dinner, and the House Special Lo Mein, which includes beef, shrimp and vegetables with wonderful noodles.  We live close, so we often pick up, but their delivery service is free and quick, too. Can't recommend them enough."}
{"text":"We were so hopeful because of the good reviews. We are lacking good asian good i. Waxhaw & South Charlotte.  Took the drive to Waxhaw and it was not worth it. All the food was bland and flavorless. Our beed lo mein had just 2 pieces of beef. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"They deliver to the Medina Hampton for $1 if you order a min of $12.  That said, the 45-60 minute quoted delivery time was closer to an hour and a half.  But, they remembered everything AND everything was hot.  And most of it was pretty darn good.  Sesame Chicken combination was dark meat, but plentiful, no scary pieces and the sauce had some kick.  Includes pork fried rice and an egg roll for less than $8.  The Hot and Sour soup was delicious.  Perfectly spicy and sour, chock full of stuff.  $2.  Add a bag of shrimp chips for $0.75!  Also ordered the fried donut for $3.  There are 10 sugar-covered little donuts in the box!!  The only true miss for me was the egg roll, but I don't care for cabbage innards.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Really good food, generous portions and really great prices! Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"This place surprised me, the food is pretty great.  I ordered takeout, and arrived to find a huge line early on a Saturday afternoon.  Once I got the food home I learned why.  This is the best Chinese I've had in Phoenix for sure.  Everything seemed quite fresh, and was closer to the type of Chinese food I am used to (coming from the Northeast).  Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Usually very fast service. Best Chinese delivery in Medina. They did have difficulty with my last order... I wanted one white rice and another pork fried rice... but they sent me pork fried rice and chicken fried rice instead! But it wasn't a deal breaker by any means."}
{"text":"I like this place for take-out or casual dining. I've had the Kung Pao Chicken, Honey Spicy Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Pepper Steak, Chicken with Vegetables, Chicken Lo-Mein, Hot and Sour Soup, and egg rolls and liked it all. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Foods are really wonderful, I like that how owner is cooking everything fresh.  Also I can taste that she is using  quality food products.  Thank you for everything and I'm  glad we having this cute restuarant in waxhaw."}
{"text":"This is in a little strip mall in Waxhaw all the way down 16. Don't let that fool you it is delicious! I live in Charlotte but was staying in this area. There are not a lot of places that have a PuPu platter but Asian Grill does and it is a good mix of appetizers. The PadThai has a perfect amount of heat. My Mother also enjoyed the dish that she had. The staff is so polite and very helpful. I would drive back to Waxhaw to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Singapore fried noodles are unbelievable. Get them extra spicy!!  Great service!  Great food!"}
{"text":"Best takeout around . I've eaten some pretty good Asian food living in New York and California and I'll be the first to admit that this little gem in Waxhaw ranks amongst the best .. Friendly staff , super fast service and most importantly great food .."}
{"text":"Decent food. Nice staff and fast orders. Online orders are a nice option. All you'd want from a local neighborhood Chinese take out place."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last Friday night.  Called in the order and picked it up.  Got home to find our order was wrong.  Called to let them know.  They don't ask for your name, go off your caller ID phone number.  The same guy answered when I called back.  Put me on hold, came back and asked if I wanted  to come back and get the correct order.  I said no.... I live on Riggs and Gilbert....too late.  He said next order for Sweet and Sour Pork was on them and would note it since that is what they screwed up on.  Called tonight 4 days later and the girl that answered said they do not \"do that\".  Meaning stand behind their screw-ups!  No body is that good.   Really????? Then she told me I had never ordered before!!!   Really??   I used the same phone and gave her my phone number TWICE!  Potential steady customer and that is their stand????   I agree with all the other frustrated Yelpers.   By the way,   I was ordering 2 entrees and 2 appys.   Not \"looking for free food\".  She already had my order for the rest.  Never again will I darken their doorstep."}
{"text":"Great food for a fair price... Like NJ delivery in AZ!  Delivery guy is great.  Go with the King Pao!"}
{"text":"Crab Puffs are cheap, a bit sloppy but it'll do if you're hungry. House Lo Mein is the bomb! If you dine here you have a nice view of the kitchen, and it's always clean. Delivery is awesome too. Serving is big. Servers/Delivery guys are friendly."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed.   Every dish has its own flavor and it is top quality.  We have a carry out one to two times a month.   Best egg fu young in the west."}
{"text":"A rather unlikely location for \"new\" Asian fast food (in Sun Lakes??), but Asian Grill is a real find. Wonderful lettuce wraps and probably the best hot and sour soup we've found in the Valley."}
{"text":"Nasty! Worst food I have ever eaten.. Pho was well Nasty! The other food over cooked and Nasty! Sorry was hoping for a food experience.. It was nasty!"}
{"text":"This family owned place has the BEST egg foo young!  I LOVE the owner's daughter, Ivy.  She is so sweet and helpful.  I really like supporting local places like this that treat me well.   Definitely give this place a try.  No MSG, which is a HUGE plus for me."}
{"text":"Never eaten this place before, now that I know how delicious it is I'll be a frequent consumer! The employees are super nice as well!"}
{"text":"Consistent, good delivery. Eight (EIGHT) potstickers per order. Really tasty chicken fried rice, especially when I add extra egg and $2 extra chicken.  Friendly staff. Quick delivery."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on New Year's Eve for my wife and I and we both loved the food. We ordered two meals and that was more than enough for the two of us and we had some left over for the next day. The vegetable lo mein was delicious and the orange chicken tasted extremely fresh. The staff was extremely friendly and delivered great service. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We have tried every Chinese delivery in Chander over the past few years and have found them all to be barely edible...and we aren't picky eaters. Honestly, fellow Yelpers, we even didn't like the one's you gave 4 stars. Where's the flavor? We tried Asian Grill delivery tonight - wonderful...delicious! We finally found excellent Chinese food delivery in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and the order arrived very quickly, best Chinese delivery in town as far as we're concerned!"}
{"text":"We got take out tonight from Asian Grill. I've been dying for a good beef curry. It wasn't on the menu but they made it for me. so yummy. Ate the whole thing. We will be ordering again soon. We also got sweet and sour chicken and dumplings also fabulous but I'm a curry nut"}
{"text":"Well, after reading a few reviews on a local Facebook Page I decided to try this new little strip mall offering. Wish I had not. First the waitresses  ( two for only about 8 tables? ) knew nothing about the menu. When my sister asked which was the best appetizer..they looked at each other quisically and said... \" Hmmm I don't know?''    They had not tried hardly any of the appetizers. We ordered a couple of the Scallion Pancakes and a Chicken Egg roll...I have no idea except perhaps the Microwave - how they cooked this glutinous pancake..what ever they did to this frozen item - It was wrong! The eggroll was greasy and also had been frozen. We ordered the Mou Sho Pork and the Moo Sho Veggie and Mongolian Beef..to say there was any difference between these three dishes would be lying. The same base ( all onions and sauce) was in all three. The Two Moo Sho's were the same except for tiny strips of pork in the meat one. The Mongolian Beef was very sweet and had the same onion base - I had ordered it extra spicey. It was not. I am wondering if the people who had been here were not familiar with Chinese Food or just starving for it.  They staff was undertrained and the owner said she had 5 restaurants.. Not sure who goes or better yet who returns...It won't be me..."}
{"text":"What a great place. The service was amazing. They happily modified their dishes to our needs. The waitress was especially good with the children the food was great. I especially recommend the Mongolian Beef but all the dishes we had were really great. This is now our go-to Chinese restaurant in the Charlotte area"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for this far out of the city! They were able to sub in tofu for me. I ordered Kung Pao Tofu spicy and the heat was good. They don't use any MSG and my meal was made fresh and tasted that way too. Would def come back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Great Chinese Food. Fast Service. No MSG. Large portions, reasonable prices. We go here often and they are busy but you get waited on fast and you get the food fast. Best Hot & Sour Soup and General Tso and Orange Chicken around. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Updated 5/24/18:  We tried delivery tonight and it was very good.  Delivery was maybe 20 minutes after I ordered the meal.  We had Lo mein, hot and sour soup and Kung Pao Chicken.  Everything was very good.  Note to self - we enjoyed the meal much more when we didn't order deep fried dishes.  Original review:  Ordered take out from this restaurant the other day.  Food was good and definitely old school. (Orange chicken as well as sweet and sour pork were heavily battered and deep fried.)   Much better than our other neighborhood Chinese restaurants, with possible exception of Panda Express. This won't be my first choice for a healthy Asian meal, but when you need old school Chinese done right, this is your place."}
{"text":"Place is great Chinese food is good the only bad thing about this place is that the crab Rangoon has no crab in it just cream cheese."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Asian Grill for years. The food is always good, The ingredients are top notch (white meat chicken, fresh vegetables, etc). Delivery is always quick and the staff is lovely. SO glad to have Asian Grill."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food. From Philadelphia and expect all Chinese to taste the same. This is pretty similar but when ordering spicy,  you make want to really emphasize that because I have yet to have anything spicy even though I ask each time."}
{"text":"The portions are large enough to serve 2-3 people minimally. The servings do not come overly drowning in sauce and are not \"greasy\". Food is quickly made upon order, we've only had take out. The restaurant appears to be quite small. Food tastes very good. We've had almost everything from the menu."}
{"text":"Was craving Chinese and relied on Yelp to point me here. A bit out of the way, but I figured I'd give it a shot. It's not like I have many great Chinese options nearby.  Looks like most of their traffic was take-out and delivery, place was empty on a Saturday night. It's a walk in, place your order at the counter and we'll bring it out when it's ready kind of restaurant.  Won Ton soup was good, as were the egg roll, crab rangoon and pot stickers. I'd rate them as average, nothing more but definitely not less.  Main dishes were honey chicken (son had them leave out the spice), Teriyaki Chicken (daughter wanted this with dark meat), Mongolian beef and Kung Pao chicken and shrimp.  I know the kids didn't really order Chinese, but they liked their meals and I thought they tasted fine for what they were. Kung Pao was good and the Mongolian was ok. A bit black peppery and sweet moreso than spicy.  Price was ok for what we ordered off the dinner menu and we did leave with leftovers.  All-in-all this was a Yelper disappointment for me as the place was rated as if it were a great place and it was merely ok.  If I happened to be in the area I'd do lunch. If I lived nearby and wanted to order out, would do so. But won't specifically head here."}
{"text":"We love Asian Grill! The food is great and the service is even better. You can tell with all the regulars that show up. I always get the beef and broccoli with crab wonton appetizers.  Also, our kids that are extremely picky eaters basically eat anything that we get from here."}
{"text":"Hands down- best Chinese food in the Waxhaw area.  Service is always on point, and every single dish I've tried is better than the last.  Give it a try- you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"We were looking for an alternative Chinese food.  We searched for delivery and Asian Grill popped up. I don't actually think they actually deliver, but the menu looked good.  Plus the emphasis on white meat chicken for many dishes was curious.  We ordered online (brilliant), and the food was great and I didn't feel awful afterward."}
{"text":"Coming from NY, it's hard to find a Chinese restaurant that I like, but this is by far my favorite in the area! I enjoy everything we order from here, especially their shrimp spring rolls. I'm glad we have good Chinese food in our small town!"}
{"text":"Asian grill is a hole in the wall, but a treasure!  Don't expect much of the service. Not in a negative way.  They're quick and efficient, but they aren't there to dote on you! The food is consistently good.  Not too salty and not too heavy on the sauce. I personally recommend the shrimp chow mein, extra extra spicy! I get it everytime."}
{"text":"We've been in Waxhaw for 11 years and have tried EVERY Chinese restaurant in the area. We FINALLY have a favorite! We ordered several dishes to share and we loved everything. The ingredients were all very fresh, the servings were generous, and the service was very friendly.   My only minor complaint (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is the fried rice....it was dry and bland. It was fine with other items mixed in, but (in my opinion) fried rice should be able to stand on it's own. I do wonder if the rice is different if it's ordered by itself than when it comes as the complimentary side with an entree. Our rice was the complimentary side, so I will give it another try by placing an order for fried rice next time."}
{"text":"I've been here before and the food was good. Tonight I'm not sure what they gave me, but it was not what I ordered. It may just the night you go. I will not go on Tuesdays again. Not happy with the taste or the serving."}
{"text":"The best Chinese-American restaurant I've found in the area so far. Highlights were the General Tso's, and the clearly homemade eggrolls. The crab rangoon was cooked nicely but the filling was a little bland for my taste. The service was excellent. They take a team work approach to serving and it shows. Our drinks never emptied, and everyone seemed to be smiling and ready to help. One recommendation to management; They bring out the food as it finishes cooking, but it would be better to bring the entire tables food at once so that no ones food gets cold while the table is waiting."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Owner was so sweet! Will not go anywhere else for Chinese. Very clean also!"}
{"text":"Good service. The triple delight and the beef, chicken, shrimp trio was very good. And I enjoyed the Asahi beer."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some Chinese food this is the place in Waxhaw to try out. it's tasty and fresh. Their dine in and take out services are both very good and the takeout food has been nice and warm still when we received it at home.  Portion sizes are good and the waitstaff and owners are very nice.  Pricing is super reasonable as well."}
{"text":"We have lived in Waxhaw now for almost 5 years and finally have found the best local Asian food around! We got the General chicken, Bang Bang chicken, and the kimchi bowl. All were deserving 5 stars! Their chicken is all white meat and cooked perfectly! Their sauces have the perfect amount of flavor and heat! We will not be visiting any other local Asian places besides this one!"}
{"text":"I gave this place another shot because it's possible I just ordered the wrong thing. I was wrong indeed. My family ordered a bunch of food for dinner (lo mein, mixed vegetables, fried rice, egg rolls, soups, etc) and it came in a giant cardboard box. They threw in some Chinese donuts for free! The food was quite flavorful and better than average as far as Chinese food goes. I will be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"I've only had General Tso's Chicken from this place. I like mine to be crispy with more flavor and the chicken was too to soft and bland. The customer service was great though."}
{"text":"Since our favorite : Golden Canyon closed we haven't found a restaurant with the same quality.   I did a Yelp search and came across this place! Jackpot! There hasn't been a dish that we've ordered that doesn't taste amazing! High quality and full of flavor. Let's talk about the prices! Easy on the wallet.   Since we first started ordering (the place is small and usually semi filled at night- super casual), we always call in a pick up order. This place is located in a tiny shopping center in Sun Lakes. The owners/ staff are always nice and accommodating.   Bonus: Lunch specials are a great way to try more than one dish- you can't go wrong with General Tsaos Chicken and a must is the Hot and Sour Soup!"}
{"text":"The food is good but you need to demand your bills. breakdown of orders are somewhat vague. We just felt we are somewhat overcharged. I'm so hesitant to visit this restaurant even though it's near us."}
{"text":"Goodfood a diamond in the rough the first time I've ever not put soy sauce on my food because it didn't need it the flavors outstanding my sons orange chicken out of this world he gives it a thumbs up friendly service nice people would go back there again for the food in a minute I recommend it definitely"}
{"text":"We decided to order from here based on recommendations. Not sure if it was because we ordered at 8:00 and got our food at 9:00 (last customer per the delivery guy) but the food was awful! I've ordered from here before many years ago and this was by far the worst! Reminded me of frozen entrees, however those would even be better. We both ordered the Kung Pao shrimp and it was floating in thick sauce and just tasted old, like it had sat out on a steam table all day. Sorry but never again!"}
{"text":"Took the family to Asian Grill for dinner and we ordered the food to go since there really wasn't a dining room to speak of. I ordered mushroom chicken with a side of fried rice and an egg roll. The others in my group ordered a bunch of food, so it took about 20 minutes to make.  Once we got home, we were missing an egg roll, but they gave us extra fried rice, so we weren't upset. The food was pretty good. I devoured my mushroom chicken and tasted my son's orange chicken. My favorite item was the fried rice.  In comparison to other Chinese food I've had, Asian Grill is about average. There are still other joints that I need to sample, however."}
{"text":"I've tried this place several times.  Food is good but not very much when it comes to portion sizes."}
{"text":"This little gem always delivers.  What it lacks in ambiance, it delivers in pretty decent food that is fresh and flavorful. Prices are great and service is always with a smile. We typically get take out when the craving strikes."}
{"text":"Mae never disappoints!  Best food every single time I eat there. Been going since it opened and it's always awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been to this place many times. It is a great neighborhood Chinese restaurant. Fast service and good is always fresh."}
{"text":"This place is great! Placed and paid for my order online and my food was waiting for me when I got there"}
{"text":"We ordered online which was convenient,  but were disappointed that it took over an hour for the order to arrive.  The food was delivered warm and tasty. We especially enjoyed the lemon chicken and vegetable egg roll."}
{"text":"I discovered this place years ago and came back finally for some take out. The food is still as awesome as when I started coming here! Yay. I ordered the General Tso chicken and it comes with white rice. Portions are generous and pricing is reasonable ($8.50 ish before tax). The lunch specials are awesome here too! Check out this local Chinese joint! The young man who helped me was very sweet, as well. More kudos."}
{"text":"I was so thankful to have found this place after moving down from NYC. I had given up after trying a few places in the area, but drove past this one day and decided to give it a try. Really solid food."}
{"text":"The food is amazing the owner is originally from NYC, food is always fresh and extremely tasty.  If you are missing your NY/NJ Asian cuisine than this is definitely the place for your taste buds!  We are a huge fan of their food and highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Asian Grill offers fast and friendly service.  I stopped in on one snowy evening for some take out and was greeted with a smile.    Prices are very reasonable and the selection is great. They offer:  appetizers, soup, chow mein. chop suey, egg foo young, lo mein, sweet & sour, vegetable dishes, pork dishes, chicken dishes, beef dishes, seafood dishes, moo shu, combination platters and house specialties. They also have  33 lunch specials, all under $5, Mon - Sat: 11:00 am-3:00 pm and Sun: noon- 3:00 pm.    The Wonton Soup was good, make sure you order Shrimp Chips to make an amazing bowl of goodness.    All around great place for grab and go chinese food.  They also deliver within Medina city limits on orders over $12.  Go to their website: http://www.asiangrillmedina.com for coupons and menu!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Prices, and Great service. They even delivered during a monsoon storm that started after we placed an order! Would definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Good food, delivery took almost 90 minuets .  The driver was not very nice had no utensils in the bag"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. It's the best Chinese food I've had. I'm not a huge fan of Asian food but I could eat their food everyday!"}
{"text":"Wow! We usedYelp review to find this yummy place. It was better than we expected. The food was delicious and the brother and sister team were very friendly and hospitable. The price was very reasonalble too."}
{"text":"The Asian Grill is my go-to place for lunch. I have gone here for years and am hooked on their Mongolian a Beef luncheon special. My wife loves their Wor Wonton soup and always asks for that if I am doing take-out. The food is fast and wholesome. Easy access and decently priced."}
{"text":"Delish!!!! My fianc√© and I wanted to try a different Chinese food joint (our regular just wasn't doing it anymore) and this place was great! The staff was very kind, food was satisfying, you get your bang for your buck here."}
{"text":"Primarily a take out restaurant with some seating.  The food is fresh and you generally do not have to wait a long time for your food. The food is good and tasty.  I've had a number of their dishes including the orange chicken and Mu Shu pork, pork with vegetables and pork in garlic sauce. All were well prepared.  I've also had several of their chicken and sea food dishes.  The sea food dishes have been good but not as good as some I've had at other restaurants. Definitely a good place to pick up take out food.  If the ambience were nicer I would rate it higher."}
{"text":"This is easily the best Chinese food in Waxhaw.  Moreover, it is just a very good Chinese restaurant anywhere.   The food was flavorful and good portion sizes.  The service was great and very family oriented.  Great place!"}
