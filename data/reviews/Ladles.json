{"text":"A very needed place in the growing Fort Mill area. Great soups and sandwiches at reasonable prices. A wide variety of options. Service is a little slow, especially given the already made soups and simple sandwiches - which is something they should work on. Not open on Sunday's which is unfortunate as this would be a great place to visit for lunch with friends or family."}
{"text":"Wow!!  Wide variety of soups that you can try like you are at an ice cream shop. They sell the soups as their expertise, and they certainly deliver, but their sandwiches are also incredible. Try the Turkey Bacon Griller with the She Crab Soup!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! So glad I gave this place a try! I got the BLT and loaded potato. The loaded potato had a lot of flavor. Unique flavor too, but was good. 

You can sample any soup. I sampled the Greek Lemon Chicken after I ordered. I will definitely get the Greek Lemon Chicken next time!"}
{"text":"Excellent soups and sandwiches. All homemade and they let you sample before you order! Tasted the buffalo chicken,  thai chicken, Greek lemon chicken, all wonderful. Had a bowl of the Thai chicken and homemade pimento cheese sandwich--super good! They also have frozen to go. Service was quick and the ladies were very nice. Perfect for a cold day. Definitely going to be a regular."}
{"text":"Randomly found this place traveling to South Carolina on vacation. I'm from up north so I'm used to Panera. This place blows it out of the water. Had a great experience."}
{"text":"I had broccoli cheese soup and a friend had loaded potato.  They both tasted like a white sauce with a few vegetables.  We could not eat it.  The sandwiches were ok."}
{"text":"A rainy day and perfect for some soup. The BLT on pretzel bread was fantastic and the bacon was cooked perfectly. The Buffalo chicken soup was exactly what I needed for a bad weather day. Comfort food at its finest. Friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Just had the Buffalo Chicken Soup. DELICIOUS! Great flavor with just a little heat. Not too much. Greek Lemon Chicken Soup is THE soup if you're not feeling well or have a sore throat. And the Turkey Chili is so spot-on, you'd never know it's turkey. My husband had no idea and thoroughly enjoyed it. Don't bother asking for \"regular\" chili. They don't have it. Just ask to taste it and you'll see for yourself. As a matter of fact, ask to taste any & all they have that day! They want you to be happy with the soup you choose! Now that's customer service. Don't miss out on the Pear & Walnut Salad with Champagne Dressing. It's soooo good. I got a half salad and bowl of soup and was pleasantly stuffed!! All comfort food here. Can't decide? They have a Soup Sampler. Three cups of soups of your choice with bread. So happy."}
{"text":"Going to ladles was a very pleasent experience. The food was exquisite at a fair price. My cashier and server was Mason, and he was extremely helpful and very attentive. Would definitely recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Tomato Basil soup is to die for! Sandwiches are great! Place is small and gets kind of crowded so be prepared."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and their soups, sandwiches, and salads are delicious! Good place to go if you're in a hurry as well!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place and ended up extremely disappointed. My hubs had the she crab soup. It was such a weird taste. It had barely any crab and tasted like it was loaded with wheat. I know that sounds strange. I had broccoli and cheddar it was the worst broccoli and cheddar I've ever had. Way too creamy with very little flavor. I get broc and cheddar at Harris teeter and it is much better and cheaper. We ended up throwing the soups away. We never throw food away. The couple who runs the place was very nice but we need more than that to go back."}
{"text":"Super fresh!  Perfect portion sizes with a lot of choices.  Soup samples a must, not a bad one in the bunch.  Cool soup options perfect for the summer.  Knowledgeable and friendly staff ready to suggest    salads, sandwiches and SOUPS."}
{"text":"Soups are absolutely incredible!!! I wasn't crazy about the sandwich I ordered, but I will definitely be going back for the soup. The She Crab was one of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this restaurant. My husband and I discovered it a couple of months ago and now we go all the time. The soups and sandwiches always taste fresh and the employees are always so friendly. You can taste any or all of the soups before you make your decision which is super helpful. I love the endless soup and bread even though I can never eat more than 2 servings. LOL!  I also love the herb cream cheese and veggie sandwich. Definitely go try this restaurant. You won't be disappointed. We drive from Ballantyne for it!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! The Broccoli and Cheese soup was amazing..very fresh. Caprese sandwich had great flavor. Will be back soon to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"They take the simple and make it AMAZING!  The ONLY reason they didn't get the 5th star is because the  Buffalo Chicken soup isn't coming back until fall."}
{"text":"Food was very good both times. They'll need to speed up service to survive. I hope they do because a place like this is sorely needed in the area."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing every time! Turkey bacon grilled with buffalo chicken soup is my go to."}
{"text":"Updated: another visit and loved the potato soup... me the non-fan of soup loves the soup. Had to have the pear salad again and it's still fabulous.

Completely awesome! I live close by and never ventured in because honestly, I'm not a big Soup fan (hate onions). Daaaang I missed out. I'm about to become a regular.

I ordered the pear/walnut/blue cheese salad and it was amazing. I don't mind paying $9.95 for a big GOOD salad.  I know how expensive all the ingredients are. Nice blend of mixed greens (not crappy nutrient-free romaine or iceberg) and generous with the yummy stuff. Pear was ripe. Fresh everything. Dressing was great. 

Mom is a senior and a soup connoisseur. She makes and freezes her own homemade \"grandma\" soups and she LOVED the tomato basil. She had that and 1/2 a club sandwich which she said was \"perfect\". This is a massive compliment.

Dad (senior) is spoiled by mom and often claims all soups are \"too salty\". He LOVED the broccoli cheese soup and said his tuna sandwich was \"fantastic\". He's tough to please sometimes so this is gooooood.

While we waited for our carry out (lunch) it was definitely busy but a few open tables. Everything we saw looked delish. Staff was super friendly and fast with carry out so no complaints there. Def coming back soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic little sandwich and soup place! Wonderful, friendly staff and delicious food. Try the buffalo chicken soup! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The setting: a cloudy, somewhat chilly day in January which called for soup and a sandwich. 

The sandwiches were hearty. I had the club, my wife had the grilled cheese/bacon/tomato special which she liked as well. 

A plus is that they let you sample their soups before you buy. We tried the buffalo chicken, broc cheddar, potato & also she crab. All were WAY too heavy with the cream soup base.  You could barely taste the actual flavors of the soup. My wife settled on the vegetable soup but it was so so too. 

Maybe they had a bad day, I'd give them another try."}
{"text":"Got the killer deal XL with broccoli and cheese soup. Tasted great! But it went threw me like water, same for my sister who was with me. She got whatever the crab soup was and not even 30 minutes past and we were running for the bathroom. Great service, but I will never get soup from here again!"}
{"text":"This place is a go to for me as its close to home but more importantly it's delicious. I love walking in and trying the specials or getting a favorite.

I had the Lentil and sausage the other day and I fell in love. I wish I would have gotten a vat of it b/c when I returned the next day, it was sold out. Good news, they had jambalaya and it was magically. I purchased the largest size and curled up in the sofa, on this cold windy spring day and consumed the warmth of a slightly spicy, hearty but light meal.

Thanks for bringing some variety to this area Ladles."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and absolutely love it! The Greek Lemon Chicken soup is absolutely incredible! This is the first time I tried the Grilled fruit salad. Very good. I think the seasonal Kale Caesar salad is probably the best salad I've ever had though.There is a huge menu to choose from. Would give it 5 stars but they seem to always struggle with having enough help but will definitely continue to eat there!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the area. I usually go for one of the salads, but the grilled-cheese sandwich is heavenly and the turkey chili is also quite good. As for salads, I've had the beet salad and a few of the daily specials. The ingredients are always fresh and the portions are a respectable size. Everything is reasonably priced and the included 8oz side of soup is a nice touch. My only complaint is that I wish they served freshly toasted garlic bread instead of the plain roll that comes with most meals, wink wink."}
{"text":"This is a nice, quiet, small location with a variety of sandwich and soup options. The veggie-head got a tomato basil soup and american grill cheese - I wasn't impressed by either. The soup tasted like it was store bought and plain; I could've made a better grill cheese sandwich at home. The carnivore got she-crab soup which had a very strong crab flavor but not much crab; overall the taste was good. We've decided to go back, try other items on the menu and give it another shot."}
{"text":"We visit Ladles almost weekly and love their selection!  

The staff is so friendly and helpful.

They stay busy but you get your food pretty quick."}
{"text":"We checked Ladles out one afternoon with the kids. We love soup, and we're excited. Disappointment was to come. The soup was very bland and lacked actual substance. I don't even think it was homemade. My daughter ordered a hotdog which happened to be laced with a long brunette hair. We were truly disgusted. We won't be back. Even minus the hairy hotdog, the food was simply not good."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The soups are good and the sandwiches are inventive. The issue is that they seem to never be open as advertised. I made the trip with my son today. They were supposed to be open until 3:00 but were already closed at 2:40. They have a big sign that they are now open on Sundays. Frustrating."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for a late lunch. I order the tomato basil and half a grilled cheese, my mom ordered the egg salad sandwich and a cup of chicken noodle. The sandwiches were a lot better than the soup. My 2 year old niece really enjoyed the egg salad. The sweet tea was also very good! But the soups weren't very flavorful, I had to add two packs of salt and pepper to get any flavor. My mom said hers tasted like a store bought soup."}
{"text":"I have patronized this location a few times because they are close to my home. Each visit gets worse and worse tho as far as the quality of the food. I have threw away more food than I have eaten. But this may be my absolute last visit after yet again another salad with inedible hard chicken. The yankee corn chowder soup was clumpy. I guess that's what I get for ordering a salad and soup an hour before they close. On a positive note the champagne vinaigrette is the absolute best as well as the salads without the chicken usually. Prices are meh."}
{"text":"All I had was a soup option on my visit here. There are many soup and sandwich options. My bun, that comes with the soup however was a bit cold, like it was removed from a fridge. I had to ask for it to be warmed up...it was?, as the guy at the front was very very pleasant. But it was still a little cold inside...so not warmed enough. Suggestion: serve a freshly toasted/warmed bun with the soup! If this is something that is already done...I missed out, but if not, it would have made the world of difference to my experience and to this review. Otherwise, great location, good service, good options. Hope to be back to a fresh toasted, butter melting bun...warm through and through!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight and the staff was super friendly! The walnut pear salad was amazing. And they let me swap out the blue cheese for feta :) they make their own salad dressings and i loved the champagne vinaigrette so much I bought some! My husband got the she crab soup and veggie sandwich and is very happy. Nice fresh food that hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Yum!  So good.  I had tried this place when it first opened and wasn't impressed, but I'm chalking that up to new-business issues.  What we had tonight was stupendous!  Going to eat here again as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"I found Ladles by accident. During a recent trip to credit union during my lunch break I decided to check out the new Mercantile Place storefronts. With my intent being to pick up sushi at a nearby establishment, I quickly clicked over to the handy Yelp app for a restaurant search and low and behold Ladles was listed #1...

I ordered a Turkey Bacon Griller with a side of Garden Vegetable soup. The soup was very good! Although, I felt my serving was a bit overtaken by oregano and green beans - no offense to green beans and their families - but a little better coverage of all veggies would make it amazing! I like the fact that the soups and scratch made daily.

The TBG was greasy but very very hearty and delish! They did not shy away from the turkey or bacon .. and for the price I paid I appreciated not being shorted on The Meats! The cookies look very tasty too.

They have a very nice variety of soups and sammies for your liking...

It is a cozy environment, so it can fill up quickly during the lunch hours if you don't plan on taking it to-go."}
{"text":"Went for the first time, what a cozy little place.  The staff was extremely friendly and responsive.  They let us samples soups to ensure we would like what we got.  The soup came out quickly and was absolutely delicious!  Tried the tomato basil and it was awesome!  Was able to pick up some frozen quarts of soup as well.  They have a daily soup special that changes as well as their regular flavors. They also have great frozen quart specials, 5 qts for 15 dollars.  Cant wait for them to thaw and try it out."}
{"text":"We were very excited about this place as we don't have anything like this in our area and ended up very disappointed. The soups were extremely bland and we had to add a lot of spices to make it tolerable."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. First time was good but second was really bad. I have the potatoe which was bland my husband had the buffalo chicken and was good. The second time he had the same soup and it was so thick it was like chicken dip and not soup. It lacked flavor as well. I had the Greek chicken and it was ok but just a lot of lemon flavor. We also bought a frozen tomato and it was horrible as well. Super disappointed and won't return for a 3rd time."}
{"text":"Nah,  not crazy about it. The soups we got had no flavor, no substance. I was disappointed. The creamy potato soup was supposed to have cheddar and chives and it had neither. Who are these people thinking this place is so great?? The sandwich we had was a club sandwich and it was delicious, tho. That's it. Might try it again."}
{"text":"My first visit here was ok, average tomato soup & sandwich. Second visit was a whole different story. I ordered the chicken soup for takeout with a sandwich. Seriously, it was filled with hard pasta and get this...one tiny strip of pulled chicken. One. The soup also needed lots of salt. 
The ham & cheese sandwich was also soggy and boring. I do better. 
But contrary to another guest, I found the two people working there so unfriendly I thought of walking out without the purchase. No customer contact at all. I even asked if the chips & roll that come with the meal were in the bag so not to insult her by opening the bag in the store. Guess what...not there when I got home. 
Not ever going back.


Update:  Positive.  After receiving  a message from the owner I found out the person behind the counter was not representative of the establishment and apologized for my experience.
I went back recently for a Turkey bacon griller and that in itself was great and I was pleased with the courteous service. No longer any reason not to frequent Ladles."}
{"text":"Really good food.  I had the pear and walnut salad and the greek lemon soup, both were incredible.  My husband had the chef salad and chili.  He liked his salad but not as much as he liked my salad.  He loved the chili.  4 stars because we are not fans of the plastic utensils."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first visit to Ladles today. The atmosphere is bright & open and the staff is friendly. I sampled 3 soups -which was so nice. I chose to have a bowl of Greek Lemon Chicken - which was so flavorful. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"To say I'm in love with this place is an understatement. I went for the first time last Wednesday. I went back Thursday and took my co-workers today (Monday). The soup and sandwich combo is my go-to. You can get half a sandwich and a bowl of soup or a full sandwich and a cup of soup. Soups: I've had she crab, crab and corn bisque (special of the day), and loaded potato. Sandwiches: I've had egg salad, ladles grilled cheese (cheese, bacon, and onions...yum!), and Barron Von ladles (ham and Swiss on a pretzel roll with a special mustard). My favorite by far: Barron Von Ladles and she crab soup. Remember you can ask to sample any soup. The staff is very nice and the restaurant is clean. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We loved our meal at this location. There were 5 of us, and everyone enjoyed it. I love that all the soups are made from scratch. Great friendly service. It's very affordable too. The Tomato Basil soup was the best I've ever had. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Slow unfriendly service.  My potato soup tasted like a starchy creamy garlic and looked like glue."}
