{"text":"Banh mi! I am not vietnamese but i love vietnamese food. I've tried so many in town for many years. A lot opened and a few closed but this one survived because its the best in town."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the places I miss most about the JTM neighborhood! My favorite is the beef lemongrass with a Vietnamese iced coffee. I keep meaning to try their bun buh wei because all the Vietnamese people seem to go their to have their noodles. Their sticky rice is also very good.  It's also a great snack to bring to the movie theaters :P (especially if someone is blocking your view)."}
{"text":"The marinated pork banh mi (bì) was pretty good but I wish they were a little more generous on the vegetables and on the meat. The flavours were nice but the quantity of stuffing compared to the bread could be better."}
{"text":"Qualité prix est excellent. C'est toujours  un plaisir de croquer dans leur sandwich extra viandes.  Un sandwich savoureux et remplie sa fonction principale, nous remplir le ventre.  Quand je passe dans le coin, il faut que j'en achète!"}
{"text":"Decent bahn mi can be found here. Not only that, they do sell hard to find Vietnamese grocery items.   At about $5 a bahn mi, this is a good place to stop for a quick bite or something for a long road trip."}
{"text":"Love love their Vietnamese subs. They're so good and cheap! They also have a variety of ready made foods that you can grab for a quick meal. They also have a few grocery items available to purchase as well. Great for cheap eats!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Banh Mi's! It's a small little market but has some of the best food and coffee. The staff are very nice aswell."}
{"text":"My new place is across the street from this joint, and when we signed the lease we were very excited about being so close to our FAVOURITE Vietnamese sandwich shop in Montreal.  They know their stuff. Not much more to say but good sandwiches, casual atmosphere (you order, pay and receive your food at the counter, unless you get a soup or something, and then you can stay and eat at their tables or take it to go). Super affordable (all sandwiches are under $5). My favourite is the tofu. YUMMMMM.  They close at 7pm.  Update: I've gotten sick from the pork ball sandwich twice, unfortunately. That one is like playing Russian roulette."}
{"text":"Gah, how can sandwiches be this delicious? Most of what they have is four after tax, and just the one sandwich is a perfectly-filling lunch. Crispy baguette, crunchy and tangy pickles, savory meats and fresh cilantro. Perfection in simplicity."}
{"text":"Great banh mi, reasonably priced. Soups are not bad either. Majority of the customers are Vietnamese, which gives the place a bit of \"authentic\" feel."}
{"text":"Banh mi pas cher et tellement bon !!! Le services est rapide et si vous avez la chance de goûter au café glacé....."}
{"text":"Meilleurs banh-mi ever à seulement 4$. Le poulet grillé (B3) est le choix sûr pour non initiés.  La grosseur du sandwich saura rassasiée les plus gourmands! La qualité de la baguette et des ingrédients impressionnantes. Vous pouvez même y ajouter des piments forts pour y ajouter du piquant!  De plus, la sélection des brevages est intéressante (ex.: liqueur en bouteille et canettes de boissons italiennes, eau gazeuse, etc.) Cependant, évaluez ce que vous faites par la suite,  car les épices et fines herbes donnent mauvaises haleine... :)"}
{"text":"Ma mère, difficile et cuisinière vietnamienne, dit que c'est les meilleurs banh mi de Montréal."}
{"text":"Fast service, no frills, and lots of good stuff including Banh Mi and Soupe Tonkinoise. Both are pretty good, especially the sandwiches. They are huge, and at $4, they are roughly 2 meals. Lots of different choices as well and great taste."}
{"text":"Shout out to my peeps in Montreal for making the Vietnamese everywhere real proud of their superb execution of essential Vietnamese dishes. It's a small little store with to-go plates of sweet and savory favorites, as well as popular noodle soups. They also have a banh mi bar where you can build your own banh mi. The bread was so buttery and crispy, although kind of stingy on the meat. I'm glad I stopped by and had a taste of home in the far North. Highly recommended by a Vietnamese! Also check out the grocery store next door!"}
{"text":"A great place to get an authentic Vietnamese banh mi. Fresh ingredients with all the sandwiches made in front of you. If you're ever on the go and craving for something spicy and flavorful at the time, do stop by here"}
{"text":"Pour les meilleurs banh-mi en ville. Leur sandwich au tofu vaut aussi le détour.   Il faut s'attendre à faire la file si on y va le midi"}
{"text":"I'm eating the sandwich I bought on this evening, price changed to $4.50, taste not like before, no more pate and meats....Completely disappointed.... :( :("}
{"text":"My only complaint is the little amount of meat in the sandwiches. Of course I get that everyone wants to have extra of everything and not pay anything but they've drastically reduced the meat portions in their sandwich and I feel gypped out.   Overall, I still get my sandwiches from here for convenience and taste. I just hope they're not abusing their high rating and reducing where they can to increase profit"}
{"text":"I think we just stumbled to a Vietnamese area of Montreal.  We had to try a banh mi.  It looks like they make their own bread and the sandwiches tastes just like the ones I had in Vietnam.  It's good."}
{"text":"Depuis que j'habite à Montréal, la cuisine viet me manque beaucoup. Alors pour ne pas être dépaysé, j'arpente les différents restaurants, à la recherche de la \"perfection\", la perle rare en termes de banh mi. Et pour tout vous dire, le Hung Phat a été vraiment à la hauteur de mes espérances. Qu'on se le dise, pour moi, vous trouverez le MEILLEUR banh mi de la ville ! Les raisons sont simples : à partir de 4$ comptant les taxes, vous aurez droit à un sandwich bien garni, composé d'ingrédients frais qui raviront vos palets. Le pain est assez gros pour que vous mangiez à votre faim (rien à voir avec celui de Vua Sandwichs, si ce n'est que pour le nommer). Bien entendu, votre choix varie en fonction du banh mi : poulet, tofu, pâté de porc, la satisfaction sera toujours au rendez vous. Et si vous avez une petite soif ou une envie de dessert, Hung Phat propose différents types de breuvages et de spécialités vietnamiennes.  J'en ressors toujours conquis ! Allez y les yeux fermés :)"}
{"text":"I got the grilled chicken with the clemintine italian soda.I took my time and ate it because it was seriously delicious.Best Ive had out here.I would put a bit more chicken in it..but it rocks..and soooo cheap!4$"}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for asian food for lunch after shopping around in Marche Jean-Talon. It is a vietnamese supermarket/fast food place. Lines can get long but the servers are quick. Seating is limited - probably only seats 10.  This place has great bahn mi. It was the probably the best i've ever had. The star of the sandwich is the baguette - it has a crunchy crust with soft filing. They also sell prepared, refrigerated food that you can buy to-go."}
{"text":"J'ai absolument aucune idée pourquoi, mais ce petit comptoir à sandwiches vietnamiens est devenu mon endroit de prédilection des lendemains de veille. Rien de tel qu'un petit banh mi pour se requinquer l'estomac, il faut croire!  Attention aux estomacs sensibles: les piments (optionnels, ils demandent toujours avant d'en mettre) sont TRÈS forts. Mais ça fait partie de l'expérience!   Je prends presque toujours le sandwich au porc grillé, j'en ai souvent des fringales. Celui au poulet est très bon aussi. J'ai testé celui aux entrailles une fois, pour le kick, mais j'avais l'impression de manger des spaghettis gélatineux! C'était pas super savoureux.  Les prix ont augmenté de 3,50$ à 4$ pour la majorité des sandwiches, dernièrement. Mais, disons que ça reste franchement abordable.  Il y a aussi plein de petits produits et de plats préparés qui s'emportent très bien à la maison; parfait pour le lunch du lendemain au bureau!"}
{"text":"Okay, it may seem odd that my review seems less generous than the others, but it's for good reason. When I first walked in, it seemed like a nice, clean, and pretty hopping establishment. The interior was clean, and it drew a mostly Asian crowd, which is a good indicator of nicely-made food. I ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee with a banh mi containing pate, Vietnamese bacon, and other Vietnamese-style cold cuts. Everything was very cheap and the total came to under $10, making this a very economical choice for people looking to eat under a budget. The coffee had a nice balance of strong flavors mixed with a milky undertone and icy coolness, and the banh mi was one of the best I've ever had. The creaminess of the pate combined with the variety of meats, the crunchiness of the vegetables, and spiciness of the peppers (and by spicy, I mean pretty spicy) made for an overall divine sandwich. It should have ideally been a great meal. So where is the problem, exactly?  Well, a few hours after consuming all of this goodness, I started feeling quite nauseous and couldn't put my finger on where it came from. It lasted for the better part of a few hours and it wouldn't seem to go up. I hadn't eaten anything else that day, and I was wondering if the banh mi had anything to do with it. It sounds bizarre, especially given how the inside didn't seem dirty at all and the fact that I've eaten banh mi countless times before. Until I try this place again, however, that's the only part I can put my finger on clearly. Hopefully next time I have a better experience."}
{"text":"I love Banh Mi sandwiches and I was recommended this place which is conveniently located at the corner of Jean-Talon / St-Denis.   Once you walk in, on your right you pass by a long SUPER SHINY table where patrons can enjoy their food. On your left is an open fridge area where you can pick up your desired drink, dessert and so forth. On the far right there's a deli counter where you can order your food and watch it get prepared for you in front of you. Just make sure to pay attention during the preparation and not share my fate.  I went with their #1 Banh Mi sandwich and overall it was pretty good. For a mere $4 you have this huge beast of a hoagie with the ingredients you want . The bread was perfect, the ingredients were fresh and it would have been a solid 4 star experience... if the person who did my sandwich understood correctly that I did not want my Banh Mi to be spicy. NO SPICY? MO' SPICY? Being someone who's not a fan of spicy and would much rather taste the sandwich for what it is... I felt the spiciness diminished my BANH MI EXPERIENCE! (-1).  All in all, I may try again... one day."}
{"text":"I drive from from decarie and the 40 to get me some of that delicious bahn mi. The flavors are fantastic, the price is right. Call in advance for big orders (I usually grab between 20-30 of them for the guys at work, they all trip out over these magic sandwiches)"}
{"text":"After strolling around Jean Talon market, I came here for lunch. More than ten people came in and out and got bahn mi sandwiches, but I got the crab seafood soup.  The sandwiches looked legit from the bread to the interior design. So many happy looking people came and went with their bags of sandwiches.   The soup takes a while to come out, but it's worth the wait. The crab seafood soup was spicy and they give you the adding aka sprouts, mint, lime. You can ask for Thai basil if you want.  Cheap, delicious, thanks to Yelp I had a delicious lunch."}
{"text":"Des banh mi, comment ne pas aimer ca car il y en a pour tous les goûts ! Ici cela ne déroge pas à la règle et en plus c'est bon, pas cher et bien positionné entre St Denis et Jean Talon. Seul petit soucis c'est quand on commande on a parfois du mal à se faire comprendre et filer un emballage plastique lorsque l'on précise que l'on mange sur place c'est vraiment nul et ça fait des déchets pour rien. Du coup 3 étoiles car je n'aime pas faire des déchets quand je mange sur place ...  Think about environment !!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Updating this because it's been years and I'm vegetarian now and the banh mi here keep us fed and healthy and happy and wise. They are affordable, fresh and fluffy and crazy delicious. The tofu mushroom is filling and juicy and the fresh pickled veg are so good I want to put them on everything. And they sell them here in mason jars so I can! I also like be the smiling friendly helpful staff here, and the iced Vietnamese coffee is everything good in the world in a cup."}
{"text":"Awesome banh mi! They also make great bubble tea, which is hard to find (good or otherwise) in the area!"}
{"text":"This was my spot for banh mi sandwiches but for a few weeks now i've seen the portions get smaller and smaller and the sandwiches are made so fast you don't get a bite of every ingredient throughout the sandwich. I'll be going to Vua now for my weekly fix."}
{"text":"By far the best place to come for Banh mi that I've found in Montreal. $4 for a delicious flavourful sandwich of crunchy fresh baguette and contrasting yet crazy delicious flavour. If you haven't had a Vietnamese sandwich you need to get your butt down here to try one. Stop eating subway or smoked meat.... Vietnamese subs are 10X better. I've come here twice in the last few weeks and my mouth is seriously salivating for more. Both my orders were for a B2. Get one....it's loaded with meat, veggies spicy small green peppers win mayo and Vietnamese pate and bacon. It's like an explosion of flavour in your mouth that is crunchy and delicious. The best way I can describe it is a loaded sandwich one of the best in Montreal hands down. If Banh mi is your deal you need to come here to load up your fridge. Great stuff folks. Only the best!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Some of the best Bahn Mi's I have tried and for 4$?? How can you resist??? It is always full of people eating at lunch time, the sandwiches are made in front of you, the fridges are stocked with different plates as well.  I won't lie, I'm on the verge of going to get one now....."}
{"text":"Great Banh Mi for 4CAD. The bread to filling ratio is just about ideal. I like the nem nuong, but have not tried the other flavors. They also have a nice Che Chuoi (Vietnamese tapioca with coconut and banana) in the fridge made with starchier bananas which was a big plus."}
{"text":"They have a lot of variety of sandwiches! When I first tried it, I was a little bit disappointed by the beef sandwich. However, that happens to any place with plenty of variety: you like some and you hate some. I came back for the original sandwich, and it was like the one I ate all my childhood. Really good. It's also very cheap, going for 3,50$ each. They also do it in front of you, all customized and very fast service."}
{"text":"Définitivement mon nouveau restaurant préféré! (Je dis ça à chaque fois)  Le marché Hung-Phat offre principalement des banh mi (sandwich vietnamien composé d'une baguette française, de viandes, de légumes frais et de fines herbes). Une grande variété de mets vietnamiens à emporter, des soupes repas style Hue (bún bò Hue), des petits pains à la vapeur fait maison (banh bao), des desserts et quelques produits pour la cuisine. Je vous recommande vivement le bahn mi au boeuf à la citronnelle."}
{"text":"Définitivement le meilleur banh mi que j'ai mangé à Montréal. Il goutait vraiment comme ceux que j'ai mangé lorsque j'ai visité le Vietnam l'an dernier. J'avais l'impression d'y être à nouveau!! J'ai commandé le Banh mi au poulet grillé et j'ai fait ajouter des piments forts et c'était DÉLICIEUX. 4.50$ pour une sandwich = un dîner rapide parfait! Le service était rapide malgré que c'était l'heure du diner, les employés étaient souriants, les ingrédients étaient frais et le pain aussi!   Vous n'avez pas envie d'un sandwich? Ils font aussi des plats préparés dans un comptoir à emporter ainsi que des soupes.   Absolument rien de négatif à dire, j'ai déjà hâte d'y retourner!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with their Bahn Mi after the first bite! Whatever that secret sauce/ mayo they put on their baguette is delicious. It kept the sandwich moist. The baguette itself is a generous size. I didn't feel they were trying to skimp on their meat. Then on top of that they stuffed it with all the veggies and Vietnamese pickles. Heavenly."}
{"text":"We stopped by Marche Hung Phat to try out their Banh Mi after visiting Jean-Talon Market. There is always room for good food!  There was a short line but it moved quite fast. Everyone was ordering Banh Mi to go and so did we! For $4 a nice Vietnamese sandwich is a good deal. The thing I enjoyed the most was the bun with crusty exterior and soft and moist interior.Love the pickled carrot and daikon toppings. Extra Thai chili please!  I am not sure if Marche Hung Phat serves the best Banh Mi in Montreal but I can tell you that the one I had was excellent.  Skip the Vietnamese Cold Coffee though.. it was meh...."}
{"text":"The Vietnamese tofu bành mì is a vegetarian's dream sandwich and will only set you back 4$!! The bun is perfection, it requires some work but you're not going to break your teeth. The tofu is done just right and the veggies are perfection. I can barely finish one, but I always give it my best effort as it's so damn good. Their Vietnamese coffee is also delicious with the sweet condensed milk, just be very clear with them if you want the hot version as they tend to just give you the iced one automatically. Counter service may look like it'll take forever, so don't be scared if the queue is huge, it goes really fast!"}
{"text":"Une baguette croustillante à l'extérieur et moelleuse à l'intérieur. Des ingrédients frais et goûteux. Cet endroit ne paie pas de mine, mais leurs banh mi (à moins de 5$) valent décidément le détour."}
{"text":"I first came here when it first opened a few years back. I am rarely in this area and due to traffic and parking issues, I don't come here often. I forgot how good it is here. This is now my new all-time favourite banh mi place. I got the classic meat banh mi, the shredded pork banh mi, the nem banh mi and the meatball banh mi. It was all excellent!!! The best 16$ invested this week lol! It is so good that I would gladly take on traffic and parking problems! This place also offers other vietnamese dishes, desserts and drinks along with the infamous vietnamese iced coffee. Only 4$ for a 10\" sandwich and if you buy 10 at once, you get the 11th free. The service is great, fast and more than reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Exellents sandwiches vietnamiens en plus de soupes. Mon preferé la soupe poulet curry. Petit comptoir et qq tables. Fermé les mardis."}
{"text":"Food should be eaten when it's fresh. That means most pizza's should be enjoyed at the shop, take out Chinese should be the exception rather than the rule, and restaurant meals should be completed at the table whenever possible.  Banh mi actually travel quite well, especially when packed properly. This place separates the vegetables from the meat, so that when you reheat the sandwich in the oven (350 F - for 10 to 15 minutes) they don't wilt.  The thing is that I live hundreds of miles away, so when my delivery of sandwiches came, they needed a bit of TLC to be brought back to life. If the decision is between fresh banh mi from upstate New York, or a slightly aged sandwich from Marche Hung Phat, I'm going with the imported sandwich every time.  What a delicious treat. I had the number one with ham, cha lua, and pate. But this has everything going on. Let me see if I can capture it. Crispy crust, tender crumb, meaty ham, funky pate, creamy dressing, crunchy cucumber, sweet pickles, hot pepper, warm bread, cool veggies, and all of it was in a gloriously harmonious balance.   To really get a true sense of the place, I have to get up to Montreal and try several of their freshly made sandwiches. But I'm such a fan, that I could not resist the chance to weigh in on their banh mi excellence.   Thanks to all of you who bring me delicious things from all over the world. I'm very lucky indeed."}
