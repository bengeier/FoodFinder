{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Great food for reasonable price.  Have been to this restaurant a number of times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"My family loves this restaurant! With a preschooler and a kindergartner, dinners can be tough as they are choosy eaters. But we love Mezcal. Great Mexican Food and really friendly service here. It's not the fanciest of places, but you definitely get your money's worth. Big servings and the food is generally prepared and saved quickly. Love taking friends here and I'm always stuffed when I'm done."}
{"text":"Nice place. I have had better Mexican, but the service was great,  prices are good,  and we had a great time. Have been there twice now, and we'll keep going."}
{"text":"Mezcal has thee best & most professional staff from Fernando, who has managed at Grafton for over a decade to long-time server Victor to the newer guy, Jesus.  All of Mezcal's people are always attentive, high spirited, and personable.  Mezcal's food remains unmatched in their niche of Mexican/Californian food space.  Today, we tried the Carne Con Queso Dip, the Smooth Guacamole Dip Bowl, & the Queso Cheese Dip.  Then for our meal we shared the Vegetarian E platter with a bean burrito, cheese enchilada, & cheese quesadilla.  We also ordered five (5) Beef Soft Tacos.  Everything was excellent as usual.  If you want great service & a quick bite of deliciousness, Mezcal is the spot to stop."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. What you would expect of a small town Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Used a Yelp deal, $10 for $20. House Sangria - bomb, try it for $6.99.   Chips were warm, salsa was OK.   The tacos were great! Fajitas were great too, except I think I'd ask for cheese.   Try it out if you want some good Mexican!"}
{"text":"Mezcal.  Where does one start?  We just left after a glorious meal.  Pablo, our waiter, was fabulous and just delightful.  He made great recommendations and took great care of us.  Enchiladas were great.  The hot sauce selection is even better.  Try adding some of the green sauce and some of the chipotle to the salsa. Enjoy!  Hard to top this in small-town Ohio."}
