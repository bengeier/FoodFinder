{"text":"I had to grab a quick dinner while working and I did not regret dropping by here.  When I walked in I was greeted kindly by the gentlemen behind the counter. I told him I was a first timer and he took the time to go through the menu and tell me which ones were most popular. I got the chicken platter... and boy was I glad I did! Everything on the platter was deliciou.s!! The pita bread had amazing flavour, the potatoes were cooked delightfully, the Greek salad was like any Greek salad, but the chicken was extremely tender and juicy. One of my favourite things about Greek food is the tzatiki sauce. And it did not disappoint.  I loved everything on the platter. I was super hungry and I ate it over two hours and I was pretty bloated.  I would say it would be enough for two if you added an extra skewer on. Definitely the best Greek takeout food I've had."}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary! Food is OK Service a bit slow! I guess place is ok if you are around the area and feel like Greek!!!  But don't go out of your way to try it!"}
{"text":"Yeah. Don't eat here. It's the only Greek place I've ever been to that runs out of rice and potatoes regularly."}
