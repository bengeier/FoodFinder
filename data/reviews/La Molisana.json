{"text":"Some of the review are pretty bad but I actually liked my experience.  For the entree I had mussels and the lambs chops as the main course. Everything was cooked how I wanted and the prices were reasonable. The entertainment was so-so...kinda for an older crowd but people were dancing around the tables and everyone enjoyed the evening."}
{"text":"C'était ok, sans plus. 

Resto au décor typique italien. L'ambiance était agréable quoi que le resto était vide. Une femme et vraisemblablement sa mère étaient assises au fond et parlaient italien avec verve. Nous avons commandé une lasagne et des pâtes carbonara. Ces dernières ne devaient pas être assez chaudes lors du service puisque l'oeuf n'était pas cuit dans les pâtes, faisant un genre de fond d'assiette gluant. Par contre, la lasagne fut bonne et apprécié de mon compagnon. Le service était courtois et prompt."}
{"text":"Had a really great time on Friday night with a group of colleagues. Wood-oven pizza was amazingly fresh and tasty. It was made by throwing the dough in the air to get larger and thinner each time, which was fun to see.  There was also a singer performing live, and as the night went on the place turned into karaoke."}
{"text":"What a disgusting mess. I went there for an 80th surprise birthday party for my Grandmother. The service was slow. The appetizers the waiters should have been going around with seemed to be on hold. The main dishes were too pricy for what you got. The cheapest price was 31$ for a plate of duo pasta. Look, I'm italian. I know my pasta. If I can eat my Cavatelli with a spoon because it turns into mush if I use my fork.. or if I need a chainsaw to get through my fettucini; we have a problem.
One waiter seemed to be quite update that evening, shaking a plate of salad in front of my face to get my attention (really?) or ripping a plate of soup away from a 7 year old because she was eating from the kids menu (you're joking right?).
For the price it cost, I would have MUCH rather eaten at Mc D's and then taken the rest of the $$ and gone shopping. 
Had I known, I would have never eaten my food and gone for a burger instead."}
{"text":"My husband and I take my parents here all the time. They're Italian and quite picky about their Italian food, and this seems to be the only place that agrees with them. We've been here several times and the food is always good. The decor is nice and simple, nothing too ornate or tacky. It's not \"trendy\" or \"happening\" by any means, but who cares! They have all the typical Italian specialties, including gnocchi---my personal fave, eggplant parmigiana, and spaghetti Bolognese--my husband's favorite, all of which were great!  They have a pretty good selection of wine, but their deserts leave to be desired. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The guy making the pizza may burst into song here and there...so don't be afraid. Overall, it's a good place to eat, especially with the elderly Italian parents. I wouldn't call it reasonably priced, especially if you order wine. A definite do for the annoyingly, picky Italian parents!"}
{"text":"Avoid, like the plague unless you're taking an older relative who has no taste buds left out for dinner. Gastrointestinal distress inducing plates combined with an overly loud kitschy piano man. If your thing is mediocre over-priced Italian food surrounded by old people and middle-aged white trash, then enjoy. Otherwise, go elsewhere. On the upshot, the service is quite excellent, and our waiter was incredibly nice. It's thus a damn shame that the food is terrible, and that the ambiance is reminiscent of a clown playing a piano at an old folks home."}
{"text":"Contrairement aux autres reviews j'ai apprécié l'expérience. Une pizza très bien fournie et des ingrédients de qualités. La fraîcheur était au rendez-vous et c'est ce que l'on recherche en premier lieu chez un restaurant. J'ai aussi goûté les pâtes qui respectaient la tradition Italienne. La sauce tomate est faite \"maison\" et ma note aurait et bien plus basse si cela n'aurait pas été le cas. La pizza au Nutella en dessert est somme toute banale mais la pâte utilisée relève le goût de celle-ci. Un service rapide et un prix correct pour la quantité. Je reviendrais sans hésiter chez ce bon restaurant de quartier."}
