{"text":"Great Selection

Awesome menu, can't wait to come back and try some other things.  Had the pastitsio, which wasn't quite the same as the church ladies during Greek food fests, but was pretty darn close.  Definitely coming back to sample something else.  My only complaint was that it felt like being in Eat n Park, so I didn't love the ambiance.  That is why I took off one star, but I really would say 4.5 'cause the food was that good.   Not an intimate setting if that is what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Central diner is okay. The food is usually on point. The problem is this place is sooo loud. The noise echoes all around. Do not think you'll be better off sitting on the diner side, because it's smaller, because all that gives you is better access to hearing the owners screaming at and berating the kitchen staff your entire meal. I am not kidding. Every time I have gone there this happens. I'm not sure why anyone would think any other human being should be berated for their entire work day, or why their customers should hear it too. And those huge delicious looking cakes in their display case are dry. The only reason I'd go back here is for the monte cristo... it's delicious!"}
{"text":"The  the best New York style diner in the Pittsburgh area! Everything is prepared  with care, using the best ingredients. Plenty of food with each order."}
{"text":"Ate here while staying at a local hotel. Was pleasantly surprised at the scrumptious fare offered here. While always busy, it didn't take long to get seated. The staff stays very busy turning empty tables; even that busy, servers pay close attention to your needs. Huge servings, great variety, and interesting specials. Had the fried sole with broccoli the first night. Fish was nicely done, lightly crisp, cooked perfectly.  One down side:  broccoli was stone cold. Took cheesecake back to my room for later. It was delicious -- light, creamy, and crumbly just like I like it. Not overly sweet. 
Returned for breakfast next day in a snowstorm. Not as busy yet. Tried the Hallah bread French toast with strawberries, bananas, pecans, and honey. Only had one piece, as the full order is two. It was enormous!!  But so delicious, I ate the entire thing!!  I will make this a regular stop when staying in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"We spent almost a full year driving past this place saying \"we really need to go there!\"  Only a few weeks ago, we finally bit the bullet and we've been back four times now!  The usual places in Robinson (Eat 'n Park, Applebee's, TGIFridays, etc.) are fine, but I'm not a huge fan of the food.   Everything seems to taste the same.  However, everything we've had so far at Central has been fresh and amazing.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a selection of Greek items on the menu. The chicken souvlaki, gyro and Greek salad are all fabulous.  Their menu states that they use fresh ingredients, and it shows!  The tzatziki and their house-made Greek dressing are so flavorful and delicious.  Like none I've ever had out before. My husband had the chicken fajita wrap, which he loved.  We also went for breakfast and were really pleased with the fluffy omelets.  They seem to have about 10 or so specials daily, but do run out of them later in the night (presumably because they are made fresh and not \"off the shelf\" items).  They have a great selection of dessert items too.  We've only tried the chocolate cake, but it was moist and delicious.  

To be honest, one of the reasons it took so long for us to stop in was that we heard it was a little pricey.  Some of the \"steakhouse-like\" entree items are priced a bit higher, but the majority of items are very comparable to their competition.  And actually, the portions are huge (I've had a minimum of 2-3 meals out of every dish) so it ends up being much more of a value if you do leftovers.  Definitely check it out... Don't let rumors about price stop you like it did us!

Just FYI, the fries are battered, which isn't really my preference.  But they are very crispy and served hot.  My husband is somewhat of a fry connoisseur :) and gives them a thumbs up!  

The owner(s) have been out on the floor each time we've been there, and they are always super friendly, asking how everything is.  The waitresses we have had were all very nice, and it seems like the owners stay alert when there are new staff working tables to make sure nobody is neglected.  

Finally, the atmosphere is very pleasant.  They are in the location where Denny's used to be, but I believe they gutted the building.  It looks great!  

This is definitely our new favorite place in Robinson... And possibly one of my favorites in Pittsburgh!  There are a lot of menu items on my \"must try\" list, and I'm looking forward to many more great meals here!"}
{"text":"The best meal I have had in the area so far!  The gyro platter is huge and soooooooo good. Service was very fast and wait staff was great."}
{"text":"Honest food, made simply.  The portions are generous and the service quick and attentive.  Dinner is a rush of food that moves near the edge of chaos yet some how makes it to the table, or counter, hot and fresh.  Check the specials board near the door when you come in.  I go for the Gyro Platter.  This place is a delightful contrast to the many cookie cutter national chain restaurants just over the hill in Robinson Center."}
{"text":"We go to Central quite often. I don't think there is another diner in Pittsburgh like it. While they have a vast menu with various options, the owners are Greek and the Greek food on the menu is poli kala! It's very clean and their customer service is excellent. The owners and the people they employ are hard workers. The last time we were there Rachel was our server, and she went above and beyond! While I do think it's a little pricy, you get a ton of food and the experience is always a good one:) And during a recent trip there my friend gave the manager some feedback as we were leaving. She said that she thought the ham steak she ordered for breakfast was salty. She wasn't asking for a refund, or for anything in return but, the manager insisted that the next time she came in that her breakfast would be on the house. Who does that nowadays? Not many places! Their Greek hospitality definitely shines through! I wish people would stop comparing it to a Denny's. Its not even in the same league! Just because the building used to be a Denny's doesn't mean that it needs to be constantly compared to it!"}
{"text":"I ended up eating here again since my father is a huge fan.  The service was excellent.  The managers were friendly.  The restaurant and bathrooms were clean. The food is good diner type food.  Most of us had hamburgers and they were good.  My daughter wanted a gyro but they did not serve traditional lamb style ones.  She tried the chicken gyro.  If you are hungry for Greek food I wouldn't recommend eating here, but if your hungry for hamburgers and lots of fries then this place is better than eating at a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Huge portions, awesome staff and all at a great price. You can't go wrong! This joint used to be a Dennys. Huge change to upscale. I highly recommend breakfast as well."}
{"text":"First time here and what a treat. Very fast and great service. Portions are very large. Food was excellent. Family run business. Home style cooking. Salads are huge. If you're hungry, this is your place."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat! Giant portions, delicious food, and a very friendly staff.  My parents have been going there since it opened, and my family and I followed suit.  The staff is unbelievable, everyone from the hosts to the busers.  They make you feel like part of the family, which brings me to the food.  Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner all prepared as if my Mom had made it.  They offer a little bit of everything American, Italian, and Greek comfort foods. And the price is right! Make sure you get the stuffed shrimp when you go for dinner, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So good every time! Best place in Robinson for a wide variety of food. 

They have huge portions for a great price. The food is amazing and that's anything on the menu. From breakfast to seafood to salads, anything you get will be great.  On top of their delicious food they are on top of their customer service. Always friendly and attentive to customers. Dinner time there is normally a bit of a line but it always moves fast and the wait is worth it.

Highly recommend the salads, lasagna, stuffed mushrooms, did I mention the lasagna? Breakfast is great, burgers and wraps. I have to say though if you like wedding soup, this is your place!! I absolutely love their wedding soup!"}
{"text":"First time here. Fantastic Greek Soup. Excellent service. Huge portions at great prices. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have frequented this diner on a few occasions for breakfast and early dinner. The service is the best in town, servers and managers are very nice and on top of everything. I love souvlaki, where I grew up this dish is a staple at most diners because most of them are owned by Greek Americans. This souvlaki was one of the best I have ever had. The chicken was absolutely delicious. It comes with fresh salad and I opted to get it with the rice. Even the rice was extremely flavorful. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place has great food.  Portions are large, especially for the cost.  The staff is friendly and so is management.   My coworkers and I come here for lunch and it gets crowded fast.  My only complaint, and can't blame the establishment, it gets really loud with all the patrons."}
{"text":"While on my way out of Pittsburgh to return to Western NY. I found this great Greek diner. Husband had an omelette that was great. I had the eggs Benedict. I have to honestly say I've had better. Eggs were runny. Couldn't eat it. However the banana pancake was delicious. Good cup of coffee too. Service was quick. Our server was chatty and friendly. I would definitely go back and try the lunch."}
{"text":"Driving around looking for a different place to eat today and we stumbled across Central. I never write yelp reviews but felt compelled after having some of the best roasted lamb I've ever tasted! The service is incredible as well. If you're near Robinson I highly suggest you skip all the chains and stop in at Central. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered veal parmigiana for take out. It was delicious!. The coating was crisp and the veal was tender. It was a pleasant surprise as I didn't know what to expect. Only been there the one time, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow what wonderful people and the food was awesome. I didn't save room for desert but it looked phenomenal. Daria was my waitress and she was on the spot. I wish I lived closer, on second thought it's probably good that I don't lol. 
I had stuffed cabbage and Greek lemon chicken soup. They really piled on the food. Homemade mashed potatoes were also very good. I am impressed, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"What a great place! I've been here several times and have never been disappointed.  The menu is large and the portions are very generous. (They serve breakfast all day, which is a bonus).   

We had a family birthday celebration there yesterday and everyone was very happy with their meal choices.  The house salads are large enough to be a meal in itself.  The Greek salad was good and their Greek dressing is excellent and isn't the usual oily vinaigrette.  If you can, save room for dessert.. (check out the cakes when you arrive!).  

Prices are reasonable given the size of the portions.  The servers are very friendly and are very helpful with the menu if you have questions.
 
Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Service: Host- Bad, Server - OK. It was Easter. We went for breakfast.  I called to see if they were open and the man who picked up the phone sounded like he hated his job. Not that pleasant. Upon arrival, the man who seated us had an urgent stride and speech. He was very quick to walk us to the table...and sat us near the restroom, meanwhile the main dining room had ample seating.  We requested to move because we didn't want to sit near the restroom. So he speedily walked us over to the main dining room (we were about a good 10 feet behind him). 

When seated, we felt rushed by the server also. She came over about a minute after we sat, asked for our drinks then asked if we were ready. We barely opened our menu. 

During our meal, I observed the same host seating other patrons, but his stride was very casual.  I observed this with at least 5 parties.  It makes me wonder if it was us that was being rushed.

When we paid, the man at the register was inattentive; he was watching TV...along with the host.

Food: OK. Standard diner food but below mediocre. I ordered the Greek omelet with home fries. Home fries - Half of my home fries were burnt; it was the bottom of the skillet and the cook basically scraped it and put it on a plate. Omelet - The ratio of omelet contents (gyro meat, tomatoes, etc.) was disproportionate to the amount of egg.  Also, the egg whites were not fully beaten as it was still a bit runny in the omelet.

Ambience: Lively. Noise level was average.  It is noisy but not overly where you can't interact with people in your party."}
{"text":"Was super surprised!  Stopped by on the fly expecting a \"greasy spoon\" and found it to be,  upscale with a unique variety of foods.  Great menu, pleasant and quick service and great atmosphere.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to come here. Had to wait about 20 minutes to get a table because the place was packed. We ordered the spanakopita appetizer which was good. For dinner we ordered Chicken with Asparagus and the Gyro. Everything was great. We decided to get dessert to go and got baklava and tiramisu. Back at the hotel we got coffee and ate the desserts. Going back for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.  Great value too.  I visit here often.  My Greek friend says the Greek specialties are very good."}
{"text":"Central Diner is the very best food around! If you are looking for homemade, deliciousness... you will find it here! Always worth the wait and you will not leave hungry! :)"}
{"text":"Skip the chain restaurants! This place very good! Staff was very friendly.  My husband got a ruben and was shocked that is was real corned beef (not the deli stuff)"}
{"text":"OMG all I can say is that today I had THE BEST French toast today. So very light and delicious. Every time I go there it just gets better. The staff is so friendly and accommodating and the amount of food for the price is really great. It's a must try."}
{"text":"The place is cleaned up nice but still smells like Denny's. I ordered hot roast beef which ended up being your typical sliced deli meat, I guess I should've asked first. The gravy had a weird orange tint, but tasted ok. When I ordered the server asked if I wanted fries or mashed potatoes, I assumed this was because it came with one of those two & even though I didn't want either, I went with mashed potatoes. Not until I got my bill did I realize it was not included but was an additional charge. Wasn't happy about that. I ordered iced tea, no lemon & the tea was actually brewed with lemon. When I sent it back, the waitress seemed to think I was out of my mind thinking the tea had a lemon taste. I felt like both her & the owner were both offended by this. Weird. I felt the food was just ok. Not in any hurry to return. Maybe for breakfast but that's it. My bill for hot roast beef sandwich, mashed potatoes & water was $11. I could've gotten the same so so food a few doors down at Eat & Park for half the price & been able to drink the iced tea."}
{"text":"The Fat Greek Omlet and Stuffed French Toast were excellent.  Although packed, they sat us quickly and service was great. Family run with great attention to customers."}
{"text":"So disapointed.  I used to really love this place until this past Saturday.  Honesty worse experience ever in a restaurant.   I'm a pretty easy customer. I want my coffee, my order, my book and pretty much nothing else.  Stop by 1 or 2 times to make sure I don't need a refill or extra napkins and I'm good.  Saturday the place was empty...I couldn't get my waitress to stop by the table for anything.  I never did get the extra napkins nor was I offered a refill on my drink.  
the very \"pretty\" manager, well he thought he was pretty...thought that it was acceptable to stand at the cash register/bar area and make rude comments about the guests in the restaurant.  He was horrible.  He had a comment for every waitress and for everyone from the kitchen who stopped to bs with him as he stood there texting on his phone.  very professional for a manager.  The hostess, I don't know if se is painfully shy or incredibly rude.  She was unable to look me in the eye when I paid my bill.  she never asked if everything was okay or even said thank you.  That irritates me so much that I called her on it.  I said, thank you for asking if everything was okay...her response...You're welcome.  I said, you never asked.  she still couldn't respond or look up.  Not great for a hostess to not be able to look at a customer.  The manager who came on duty as I was leaving gets kudos for coming outside to talk to me about my experience...unfortunately I was too angry to discuss it with him then.   the food has gone downhill in the last year....the staff in there on Saturday afternoon was TERRIBLE!  Service was BAD and I'm so disapointed because I have always"}
{"text":"First Time At This Restaurant.We were shopping in Robinson area and wanted to try somewhere different. Initial welcome in restaurant was a little strange. New host first day took us to table and server said she could not take us so he took us to another table.

Menu was very large with lots of selections.
One thing that I will say is you definitely will not walk away hungry portion is Hugh..."}
{"text":"Great food and huge portions!  Great diner food, great breakfasts, excellent lunch and dinner options."}
{"text":"We moved into town a couple of weeks ago and I noticed this place from the road and the amount of people there. My momma always told me that if there are lots of people it's probably good !  Lol So my husband and I went for breakfast....wow. 
Angela our server, was wonderful . The amount of food is out of this world. We will be eating here again! We hope to try it for dinner in the near future."}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but good positive things about this place and so we decided to try it out.  What a decision we definitely do not regret.  A clean, friendly, family oriented establishment that consists of a very hard working staff and very friendly Management (owner) that seems to always be on the floor assisting their staff the whole time.  From breakfast, to lunch, to dinner, all portions are very generous and the prices are very affordable.  Greek food with a Southern flair, but the menu consists of food that will please everybody for sure.  Great for adults, and if you bring your children, realize that the food portions are ridiculously big on the kids menu.  Remember to come to this restaurant with an empty stomach and if you see a line please refrain from wondering if it is worth the wait, it definitely is.  If this is your first time dining with Central Diner and Grille you'll more than likely be dining there in the future again and again due to the numerous items on the menu you'll want to try.    Last but not least, DO NOT forget DESSERT.  We actually made a stop here one night because we wanted something sweet to eat and left full as if we had another meal.  Once you have the dessert, please remember to order one of their gigantic cakes to go."}
{"text":"This place seems to always be busy and after eating there...I get it...their food is surprisingly good. Everything is fresh and tastes great, from a hearty dinner, to a simple bigger and fries, it always has that spin on it that tells you sometime took the time to make it right. The food is the star here but the atmosphere is also pleasant and inviting...like having a big family dinner at a relatives house."}
{"text":"Family went for the first time and was impressed.  All for of us got something different for dinner and it all was outstanding.  Service was excellent.   We are new to the Pittsburgh and may have found our go to resturant.  Big portions!!! The kids portions could probably feed most adults."}
{"text":"Great service and price. Cuban panini and gyro platter were both great. Went twice in two days"}
{"text":"This restaurant replaced the old Denny's that used to be located here. It doesn't open until 6am so I made the regrettable mistake of going to the nearby Eat N Park (I'll never do that again). This place is SO MUCH nicer. Free Wi-Fi, courteous and quiet/professional staff. CLEAN. 

I only had coffee this morning, but the menu looked great. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Upon our first visit we were met with wonderful service only magnified by the quality of the food. 

Management was well versed, understanding, and polite right down to quickly remaking a plate for the table next to us because she didn't eat something that was in her food. When we first arrived there was a small snaffoo with the specials board taking a dive sent the owner and servers into overdrive checking on nearby kiddos and other customers. 

Honestly, I was not only impressed with the food (which was incredible), but the quality of care we received from the staff. The manager was visable on the floor checking on customers, the waitstaff was checking in but not obnoxious and overbaring, and the food was totally worth it. Upon leaving I bumped into the owner in the parking lot, I couldn't resist complimenting him on the restaurant. This man is humble, honorable, and sweet. I cannot wait to return. :)"}
{"text":"Huge portions! Good Diner type food. We had kids turkey (massive sized platter), kids pasta (choice of noodle) both come with dessert options. Also lasagna (made on premises), hot roast beef sandwich (about a pound of thick sliced beef), and fried with gravy. Service was attentive and speedy. Kid friendly. Highly recommend for families shopping in Robinson."}
{"text":"Great food.. Beautiful restaurant...ordered the Greek omelette...homemade tzatziki sauce...really good"}
{"text":"Happened to be stuck in Pittsburgh due to weather and followed the reviews here. Totally worth it. Everything looked great, but I opted for the 2 egg breakfast w/ sausage and rye toast with a side of the French toast. Man, I'm stuffed but it was all excellent. It's difficult to take a diner breakfast and elevate it beyond \"good\", but they really pull it off here. Eggs were obviously fresh and perfectly cooked, sausage was just a step above your normal sausage link in quality and flavor, and the French Toast was just superb. I just wish I still had room for the baklava, it looks awesome."}
{"text":"Great service. The waitress brought out the food very quickly for the dinner rush. The food was good and the portions were large."}
{"text":"Over priced for a sandwich that came with fries that over took the plate, and coleslaw that tasted like it came straight from a mayonnaise jar, very bland.  I will not return, my husbands burger was all grease, I picked it up and grease was running down my fingers.  I heard great reviews but did not live up to the price and quality.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Really good food. Lots of it so come hungry!  Penne a LA Vodka is one of the best I have had. The Shepherds Pie is tasty too!  The owner stops to make sure things are fine which they always are.  Everyone can find something here as their menu is extensive.  The Hot Chocolate Cake is to die for.  Make sure you leave room for the delicious deserts."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! I've been here 10 times for breakfast. Try the Eggs Benedict. 

Next time I'll try dinner. The specials look wonderful."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious! This is the local version of The Cheesecake Factory but HOPEFULLY less the insanely high calories. The waitresses are always friendly and the menu will always have something to satisfy any craving. From salads to omelettes, cakes to chili, and everything in between everything is delicious and portion sizes are insane."}
{"text":"So many choices and all fantastic! It has quickly become our favorite place to go when in Robinson."}
{"text":"This place very quickly became our favorite restaraunt in the area. We have been in several times and have never been disappointed in the slightest. The environment is clean and modern, the staff is wonderful and inviting, and food.... oh, the food. Im convinced you could not order a bad meal if you tried. Every table we walk past and every meal we see being brought out makes our mouths water and we find ourselves making comments like \"oooooooh wow next time thats what im getting!\". The food NEVER disappoints. They have a huge selection of food from breakfast to lunch and dinner. And the portions are generous to say the least!! Central Diner never fails to impress, as we have never had a bad experience! They have certainly won over a couple of forever customers anytime we find ourselves in the area."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice and the food was awesome.  My 4 year cleaned his plate so you know that stands for something."}
{"text":"My husband has been wanting to try this place for a while now. I'm very careful about where I eat because of digestive issues. 

We came here today, and all I can say is, I wish we had tried it sooner!  It was around four pm so there was no wait for a table. The building was an old Denny's, but it has been turned into a classy and comfortable restaurant. The menu is diverse. Lots of Greek food. Also, breakfast all day!   Sandwiches, hamburgers, salads, soups, full entrees from (I think) 4 - 9 pm ( I should have written this while we were still there, but I was too busy enjoying my meal!), desserts (oh, the desserts!) and alcoholic beverages, if you wish. They had a nice sized kids menu. Another review referred to this place as an upscale Eat n Park. That sort of fits, but I haven't been happy with E nP lately, halfway through my meal I wanted to do a happy dance!  It was fantastic. Plus, NO digestive issues!

I had the Spanakopita. If you like Spanakopita, you have to try it here. It. Is. Heaven!!!  My husband had the lamb, which he loved. The salad that came with it was huge. Not your typical \"side\" salad. He got it as a Greek salad and the feta cheese was excellent. We got dessert to go. No room right after dinner, and it looks like I will get at least two servings out of one dessert. The portions are large and, for me, that's great. I love left-overs!

The service was great. Everyone was friendly. It was clean. We will definitely be back. There are lots of good things on the menu that I HAVE to try!

Oh, when the weather is nice they have outdoor dining. Something to look forward to experiencing this summer."}
{"text":"Me and my husband love to go out for breakfast, and my mom kept telling me \"you have to try Central Diner for breakfast.\"  So we did this morning. I envisioned it as some home in the wall, divey place with great food. Not at all!  I mean the great food part, yes, hole in the wall place, no. It was super hopping this morning. The breakfasts were very good and all of the staff we encountered were so nice and friendly. We want to try it for lunch or dinner now because the rest of their menu looks awesome."}
{"text":"This is one of the few local places in the Robinson/North Fayette area so I try to patronize them. I've been there a few times and always had the breakfast, and the last few times always go with the challah french toast with bacon on the side. Both are delicious, and service is very quick and pleasant. They also have a large menu and a ridiculous amount of specials daily. 

If I ever get tired of the french toast I'm sure there's plenty of other good stuff to have. They recently got a liquor license, though they don't really talk about it (I had to ask for a beer). I'm sure eventually they'll focus more on alcohol..."}
{"text":"Have gone to Central Diner on multiple occasions and is always very good.  My favorite is the hot turkey sandwich.

Portions are very large and filling.  Always a nice atmosphere and a manager checks in with you during your meal every single time to make sure you are happy.

Will continue to frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"This food is great! Sometimes they make a few order mistakes but they always fix it with a smile and bring out the food fixed and fresh. The staff is very friendly and it's a very sanitary environment. I would definitely recommend friends and family to come here"}
{"text":"Outstanding all around. From my server, Seth, to the menu and delicious food. Visiting from out of town and stumbled across this treasure. Parking lot was full so that usually tells you something good is going on. Once inside there were no disappointments. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast with my family and really enjoyed it. Our service was awesome! Huge portions. Negative: Pretty expensive."}
{"text":"This is the best food in Pittsburgh. The portions are amazing, the quality is top notch, and the staff bust their a$$e$ to make sure you have everything you could ask for. The speed of service is second to none. The management staff table touch multiple times per visit, even during the rush to make sure you are satisfied. Chris is extremely hospitable.

To say I'm impressed would be an understatement. Oh, and make sure you try the red velvet cake."}
{"text":"What a nice place, great atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food. It is definitely worth saving room for a delicious dessert. Will most defiantly be recommending this as a place to dine... 5 Stars from me...."}
{"text":"Hi, two of us for Sunday breakfast around 9:30. I had pancakes with bananas and my partner had one of the Greek Eggs Benedict. Honestly we both agree, Central Diner & Grille is two thumbs up+.... a lot of people must agree the place was packed, wait was only 10 minutes and they are/seem very organized. We will certainly go back again and again.  Desserts look FANTASTIC, hopefully when we go in for dinner some time soon, we get any of the cakes as well.. Huge, and look extra tasty!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best diners I have ever been to. breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Late Night. Anytime we're near Robinson, my family always goes. The family that runs this place does a terrific job of running a tight ship while maintaining their sanity and kindness during the busiest hours. It's a well oiled machine in there and it's pretty entertaining to watch, I definitely recommend getting a front row seat at the counter!

As for the food, huge portions. You essentially get two meals for the price of one, and that's a great thing because the food is absolutely fantastic. Definitely get the house salad dressing with any salad you get, you won't regret it. I have been to Central 3 times now for dinner and twice for breakfast, and for dinner I get the Chicken Parm every time. Probably the best chicken parm I've had, and it is huge. The menu is extensive, you really can't go wrong with anything else. All of the Greek options, and pretty much everything else, is homemade and tastes fantastic. Desserts (cake and pies) are homemade as well. We've yet to have a bad, or even an average experience at Central. Each time has been excellent.

Recommend for anyone in the area... it's a can't miss. I hope Guy Fieri is watching."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and hey I can have a drink at an old Denny's restaurant. The décor has been completely rehabbed and is really cool from the inside out! I would definitely recommend everything from breakfast, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Went here twice on a business trip......food was ok but definitely no 4 1/2 stars..... Barely 3. .....skip the fried fish its frozen crap.....service was exceptional ....typical diner faire"}
{"text":"The food and service was phenomenal. The owner was very welcoming and talked to his guests. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"My food came quickly, but I never saw my server again. The manager personally greeted every customer in my row of booths, but stopped when he came to me....hmmmm
The food arrived quickly but was average at best. Thumbs down for the corned beef hash."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Greek food. If you are in the area, go here! Big portions, reasonably priced and extremely friendly service. :) I can't wait to go get another gyro sandwich!"}
{"text":"Not your average diner. Huge menu and portions. Full bar. Excellent omelette selection and Greek food. Service was fast and friendly. Will definitely come here again! The owner even came around and checked to see if people enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"The shrimp I ordered wasn't fully cooked and we had to listen to the obnoxious waiter beside us make his conversation with his table known to the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"You get a ton of food for the price you pay. My veggie burger was mediocre. The salad was good and the ambiance is wide open and airy. It is a far cry from what it once was (Denny's). Much better"}
{"text":"The first two times I went here for breakfast the food and the service were phenomenal BUT today was the worst experience I've ever had here. We waited for 40 minutes for our food to be delivered to the table, we had to continually ask for drink refills and while I was eating I found a hair in my food. The manager was cool and took my meal off my bill but I'm still hesitant about going back. My suggestion is if you want to try this place go on a Saturday morning early when they aren't so busy that way you will be provided great service and a great meal otherwise you will be neglected if they are busy. Very disappointed in this visit."}
{"text":"In an area littered with chains, Central rises above the rest. Great food, great service."}
{"text":"Always have a good meal when eating here. Doesn't matter whether you're going Greek or American. Time of day doesn't matter either. Food tastes great. Portions are huge and they don't mind or charge to split your meals. Wait staff is quick and attentive even when they are slammed."}
{"text":"So this place was a little confusing for me; driving up to the restaurant it was a nice building I was impressed with and seemed to be absolutely packed! Then we get inside and it has a Denny's/steak escape feel to it. It was extremely loud with all the people in it (this was Sunday around 12:30) then I started to get a little disappointed with the place since it got 4.5 stars. Then we get our food, my wife ordered the tender (not fried) scallops and I don't like scallops, but they had a really good taste to them. My burger felt like just a really good home cooked burger. So all in all the flavor or the food won me over. Just don't expect a quiete calm restaurant, this place is hustle and bustle lol. I'd recommend this place to someone especially for a Sunday brunch or maybe a late night out with a group of friends, not really a 1on1 date place :)"}
{"text":"Found ourselves near Robinson wanting breakfast. We tried to find DeLuca's but no dice. Despite some iffy reviews, I thought we'd give Central Diner a try. This is a nice concept theme but it is not a diner. We found the menu pricey but very creative and ambituous in its scope. Service was slow and inattentive by our server and it took three trips to receive our complete order. Observing other tables, service seemed hit and miss. The verbally abusive cook or chef could be heard all over the restaurant (including the restroom) There was a very loud argument and other times he'd yell and threaten the servers (you're about to have your order wrong on every count\" and \"you're on my last nerve.\").  I overheard our server telling a regular (as she took out a personal fan and fanned herself) in response to his mild complaint about his order that \"our cook has a real attitude problem...) I mentioned to the manager about the loud cook that he's had issues with him for at least a month. Our breakfast was disappointing. My mate had a very ordinary cheese omelet for 8.95 with toast when it finally came. My waffle was very good but the bacon was greasy and obviously cooked well ahead of our order. The decor is very attractive and welcoming but, based on my experience and personal opinion,  I wouldn't return or recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat!!  I have had breakfast, lunch & dinner here & always more than happy with food quality, service & atmosphere!!  Usually take home as much as I ate, huge portions!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times with coworkers and have never been disappointed.  This past weekend I took my family here for lunch and my wife and I both got salads.  I got the greek salad and added gyro meat and it was utterly amazing.  The portions are ridiculous and the food top notch.  I was slightly afraid that the gyro meat would be slices from Sysco but that is NOT the case here.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"im from texas. come here a lot for work... i always struggle to find good restaurants in this area which dont require drives to the city and taste pretty epic... i have to say i loveddddddddd the food.. and def plan to be back soon.. some wine would have made my day, not sure why its not served,, but oh well"}
{"text":"Dinner was excellent! We stopped halfway through and asked for a box so we could sample dessert. My husband's piece of carrot cake was so large, he needed a box to take half of that home.
Waitress was so attentive while running her butt off. Food came out quickly and all courses were delicious. Plan to stop by during our next Pittsburgh trek."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, the chicken parm sandwich was horrible and when I complained the manager was rude! Don't know if I'll go back."}
{"text":"My new favorite to-go restaurant.

The place is amazing. The owners / managers take guest happiness very highly.

We went on a busy sunday morning for breakfast once with a group of 8. The owner was running around pulling tables together just so we would be seating. We only waited about 10 minutes.

Whenever I go for dinner, the food is out in no-time, by far the quickest service i've ever had. 

I will be coming back here for a long time.

5 Stars isn't enough for this place."}
{"text":"It is not what it once was. The food, especially the fries, has gone downhill. Service is still good and the food comes out quickly, for a decent price."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always fresh. Everyone is so nice. It reminds me a little of the Marietta Diner outside Atlanta. Great food quality and nothing is to greasy. My husband and I are vegetarians but no matter who we go with agree the food and deserts always taste good."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  The food is fresh and nice presentation.  The staff is always friendly and attentive.  The prices are comparable to other non franchise better restaurants."}
{"text":"First trip to Central was in a Saturday evening.  There were a crowd of people waiting, but the host said it would only be about 10-15 minute wait.  We were skeptical but decided to wait.  Well, it was about 8-10 minutes and rest assured we were in our seats!  Our waitress was very nice and quick with everything.  The food was great and there was a lot of it!  My only complaint would be the environment was a little rushed.  It had a (the owner knows how to run a restaurant and make money) New York restaurant feel: fast and furious!  BUT, I do respect how this guy runs his business!  Darn good food, lots of it and you're in and out!  I love this place and we will be back!  if you can handle New York speed, great food and a good portions, you will love this place too!   Four stars to reflect the fast and furious environment; some people don't like that."}
{"text":"First time here. Classy diner restaurant. 
Service was fast and on point. I had the roast turkey dinner $13.95, enough for 3 people. Turkey was good, Stuffing was ok at best,  Mashed potatoes really good 
(real, not instant mashed potatoes). French onion soup was really good, made fresh.
They are doing something right, i was there at 7:30 pm, place was 90% full on a Wednesday night. I will be back for breakfast tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"We actually were visiting from Wisconsin and had a really bad dinner experience! We found ourselves starving by 8:30! Central was exactly what we needed! The mushroom and Swiss burger was the best I've ever had! We also tried their cake! Carrot cake and cookies n cream cake were both amazing! Go here!"}
{"text":"Top notch diner food and friendly staff. Full bar and jazz music. Had lunch and dinner on my day off next door. I miss the Greek style diners of the east coast."}
{"text":"We ordered the blueberry pancakes for our son and the Greek omelette with sausage.  It all was fantastic!... not greasy, reasonable portions.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Easy in and out. I had lamb chops cooked just right and the other guy I was with had a dog sized stripe steak. Plenty of flavor all around."}
{"text":"When I was visiting my grandma for a couple days, she told me about this spot. I love going to diners so we went for breakfast.

I staff greets you with open arms. I loved how the inside actually gave off a diner feel. You can tell those who were working there loved their job and was proud of their restaurant. 

The portions are HUGE. My grandma ordered the french toast, bacon and a cup of fruit. I ordered the pancake breakfast with bacon! It was delicious. I could not eat it all. I had to take the rest home to my grandpa :D He liked that!

Our server was somewhat attentive. She was busy, I will give her the benefit of the doubt, but for the most part this place was GREAT.

Stop by, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday for lunch due to a recommendation by a friend. He said it was a good spot for food and family owned which is why he liked it. Upon entering the establishment there was a chalkboard full of specials which we only had a few seconds to look at since we were promptly seated. The restaurant was packed full and rather noisy but that gave it even more of a family feel IMO. 

The menu was pretty big for a diner and was packed full of good choices. When I went to wash my hands after being seated I walked past everyone's table glancing at all the food since it was my first time there. Every single dish I walked past looked amazing! When I returned to my seat I decided on going with the one special I remembered, the shepherds pie. I have never had a shepherds pie (I know I know...) so after googling it I dove in head first. 

My meal came with a cup of soup, I chose chicken noodle. It was very good but the vegetable beef is what I should have gone for. When my shepherds pie arrived I started chowing down. It was pretty good but not amazing, but considering it was my first shepherds pie it could have been the best shepherds pie in the world and I wouldn't know. I felt that if the broccoli was replaced with peas it would have been better. Anyways... the shepherds pie is the only thing that kept this place from getting 5 stars. I will surely be returning to try other items since the other food looked so amazing, everything was home made and the prices were very reasonable. Oh yea, and when I was leaving I saw 20 different cakes in the display case that were over a foot tall! I will return for the cake alone!

I am looking forward to returning and hopefully updating my review to 5 stars once I eat something I am more familiar with!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Try the fried pickles. A great appetizer. 
Something for everyone in the family. 
Especially nice and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in and had breakfast.. Wasn't too impressed.  It was crowded but not packed and our food took a while.  I drank a whole cup of coffee before our food arrived.  

After requesting \"crispy\" bacon with my breakfast.. I was actually served three fatty pieces of bacon.  Thumbs down!!!   My boyfriend gave me his - he had crispy bacon - although he didnt request it !?.   Sometimes it's the little things..   I guess someone had to be served the fatty bacon - but after requesting - \"crispy\" really? This restaurant is so noisy..its like being in a busy cafeteria.    I \"might\" give it another try for lunch or dinner but not for breakfast again thats for sure."}
{"text":"I loved this diner! Nice peaceful setting, friendly staff and amazing food! Best sandwiches I've ever had! The chicken panini and the Cuban panini were sooo good and the fries were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside!"}
{"text":"Solid diner offerings in a clean, modern, updated building. Hard-working crew who listen to feedback and take it into account. I come here for lunches a lot of the time as I work in the area. Soups are very good, if on the salty side. Wedding and beef vegetable are standouts. Sandwiches and fries are huge - I usually take half home (and I can eat a lot!). Greek specialties like moussaka are delicious and a nice addition to the area's offerings. You MUST try the homemade baklava. When in the Robinson area, please give these locals a try before going to Applebee's or Panera again."}
{"text":"Had the Beef tips with mashed potatoes, had 4 pieces of beef a piece of gristle and a truck full of mushrooms. Would be a 4.5 if I had some meat."}
{"text":"Visiting from Phoenix, this is one of my favorite Pittsburgh stops.... it is near the airport and open early/late so it is easy to fit into any schedule.  It was my friend's first time there (she is a  pittsburgher) and loved it!  We had the spanikopita & my big fat greek omelette... the lemon soup was fantastic... I also want to mention that not only is the food delicious, the service is always excellent.. this time we had Ashley S... what a delightful person!  Even though the place was packed for sunday, she gave us her undivided attention & made us feel like we were the most important customers in the world!  thank you Ashley S!  I'll be back next time I am in the Burgh!!"}
{"text":"Extremely large portions at a very, very reasonable price. The atmosphere is very simple and pleasant, and the outdoor seating is great option on a nice summer day. The menu has a lot of different options, and no matter what you order, your food comes out very quickly. Overall, good quality food at a good price (and you'll have leftovers)."}
{"text":"I am vegan and went for breakfast with 3 others that were not vegan. They had oatmeal and potatoes that were a good vegan option but that was it. I hesitantly asked our sever Patty if I could make my own avocado toast, and without a second thought she happily agreed! Sooo accommodating! Thank you Patty for being so awesome! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, but more importantly than that it is very good. Large amounts of food doesn't mean anything if its not quality food. This had both. I highly recommend it. Waitstaff is excellent too. Only downside is it is a bit loud."}
{"text":"Reminds me of my time in the NY/NJ area, where everyone could agree to a meal at a diner since there is something for everyone!  Large portions, varied cuisine, and friendly staff.  I enjoyed the gyro eggs benedict."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I ordered the Monte Cristo sandwich and asked if I could have fries instead of coleslaw. I would've gladly paid an up-charge as every other restaurant I've ever been to has allowed me to do. The waitress told me this was absolutely impossible and if I wanted a different side I'd have to pay full price. I was unwilling to pay $3.00 for an additional side when I was already getting a side, even if I didn't want it. The waitress messed up my friend's order despite my friend repeating it several times. When our meal was finally over and she brought the check, the waitress stared at us (I assume trying to encourage us to hurry up and pay) until she finally decided to take our payment instead of us going to the counter to pay. That seemed very courteous until she stood at the table while we tipped and signed the check. I and both of my friends were very uncomfortable. I read great reviews and was very hopeful about going to this restaurant for the first time, but of my whole meal I was only able to eat half my sandwich. Of course I won't return somewhere that won't let me have what I want to eat and then tops it off with poor service. I recommend going elsewhere if you dislike coleslaw as much as I do, because you can't have anything else and it comes with most meals"}
{"text":"What a nice change from the chain restaurants. 
Our service was good and friendly. 
Food was delicious and moderately priced. 
We loved the outdoor dining and great background music to top off the ambiance. 

We highly recommend dining here. I'm sure we'll return."}
{"text":"This is a bustling restaurant with a nice selection on the menu.  We went on a Monday night and it was packed and very loud.  This is not a restaurant with an intimate atmosphere.  Not appropriate for a romantic date.  The food is good and the portions are very generous.  No one in my family could finish their meals.  I think it's a good value for the money. Make sure you go there hungry."}
{"text":"Stopped totally by accident and very happy we did.  Very nice.  Very clean.  Huge food portions. Highly recommended!  Hot roast beef sandwich.  Chicken. Cuban panini.  All excellent.  Has beer, wine, and bar also."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a great selection of food. We split the Greek salad with chicken. It was a huge portion plenty for two people. For dessert we got the brownie à la mode with the whipped cream. The brownie was OK (average at best) but the ice cream and whip cream were quite good. The service was fast and efficient. I would definitely go back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying that I'm giving four out of five stars simply because of my food preferences, but this has nothing to do with service. 
Speaking of services, we went when it was absolutely slammed and we were well taken care of and our server was remarkable. 
First we ordered fried zucchini which was amazing and it normally comes with a side of marinara which was definitely homemade and so delicious. I like ranch so I asked for a side of ranch. What they brought was hidden valley in a bowl. Disclaimer: I hate hidden valley, so if you like that kind of ranch, you're in for a treat. I was hoping for a less viscous and more buttermilk based dressing, but alas no. 
Then we got French onion soup which was amazing. 
Next was the main course. My husband got chicken parmesan which he loved. I got a burger which was disappointing. The patty tasted like it was frozen and pre-shaped rather than fresh. It was just dry and there was crystallized fat that was inedible. Pretty disappointed with that as well. 
Then we paid and got dessert to go. I had chocolate strawberry which was honestly flavorless and dry. My husband got raspberry almond which was just incredible. 
So long story short (too late), all around the food is very good and the service is out of this world."}
{"text":"I'm from CT, where there are a lot of family owned Greek businesses, but this place beats them all. The food (particularly the French Onion) was a cut above all the rest and the gyros were to die for. Service by Seth and Rachel (it was her FIRST DAY) was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place for late night food for a tourist , thanks to our waitress Sonja for the Birthday Cake . Very clean and a big menu."}
{"text":"Arrived when it was very busy although we did not have to wait to be seated. Waitress cane over after a short wait and we realized she had us and a table of 12 to serve. Even though the table of 12 was seated before us, our waitress took  our order first. Food came out quickly, and was good. Ex large portions mask the higher pricing but was fair for the portion size.
Overall a good experience especially once the table of 12 had food in their mouth and we could finally hear ourselves talk :-)"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best food that I have ever eaten!  I ordered the Traditional Gyro with onion rings.  The gyro meat was perfectly seasoned and the pita was full of meat!  My husband had 3 huge pancakes, which were delicious!  (I tasted them too!)  We ended up taking 2 pieces of the huge cake home (the cakes are made by a local bakery in Castle Shannon).  I got the \"funfetti\" and he got the \"buckeye\".  Overall, great food, huge portions, decent prices, friendly service and nice decor!  We will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Bookmarked this place and had the opportunity to stop on this evening for the first time. Service was excellent and fast! Portions were HUGE! My
Gyro felt like it weighed 5 lbs and has the thickest gyro meat I've ever had! Almond torte cake was also delicious! So many choices - glad we tried out this place - we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is way too awesome for words!!!! We were in Pittsburgh for two nights... Ate there twice!!! Both entrees were big enough for two! Really quality food!! Everything from the servers to the atmosphere will exceed your expectations!!!! Wished I lived closer!!! This is a pic of my chefs salad"}
{"text":"Central Diner is the kind of concept that you find frequently in places like New Jersey, but that is sorely missing from the Pittsburgh area. It has a HUGE menu with all kinds of variants on Italian, Greek, and American dishes. The place itself is quite large, and the vibe is terrific. However, things can go wrong with this format and we had a not-so-great experience during a recent visit.

It was a Saturday night and we expected a bit of a wait. The waiting area was pretty crowded and we could see that every table was full, so when we were told 15-20 minute wait, we eagerly accepted. It was just about that long before the table was ready for us and in the meantime we were entertained by people watching and seeing how the diminutive hostess handled the crush of people.

Out table was towards the back of the restaurant and along the way we had to dodge several waitstaff scurrying about with full or empty plates. When we sat down, we noticed that there were not enough sets of flatware. Unfortunately, the hostess ran off as soon as she showed us the table, so we could not ask her to fix this issue. We waited, and a few minutes later, a tiny waitress (not everyone there was small, just these two people who happened to work our party, I swear! Nor, are we that LARGE!!!) showed up with glasses of water. She dropped them off, and before we could say anything, she turned around and was gone.

She came back a few minutes later to take our orders. We asked for the flatware and she told us that was the job of the front desk, in an annoyed tone. What were we supposed to do? Anyway, we repeated our request so she marched off and spoke to someone else. He (normal-sized person!) brought us the necessary utensils but would not take orders or answer questions as he turned out to be one of the busboys.

A few more minutes and out tiny waitress came back. Fake smile on her face she asked what we wanted. We asked if there were any specials? She pointed to a board by the front desk ... and disappeared again!

More minutes pass be and she's back. We gave her our orders ... and poof! ... gone again.

Ten minutes pass by and she's back with a plate of bread and some butter in packets. Drops that off, and runs away. By this time, at least one of the water glasses is completely empty... I won't bore you with the whole story as you see the trend. By the way, I do not blame her. As we watched, she was running from kitchen to tables and back. She was constantly busy. She obviously needed help to take care of as many tables as she had, but everyone on the staff seemed quite as busy so this was probably a management issue, not a waitress problem.

Eventually our food arrived. The verdict on it was mixed. The Salmon and Crab Cake entree was superb; the Shepherd's Pie was pedestrian; the Chicken Souvlaki was bad (the chicken was obviously cooked on a skillet - not a skewer, and the peppers and onions were raw and placed on top of the cooked chicken). The side salads were boring; the dressings were watered down. The whole experience was mixed.

I am not sure if we'll come back. Maybe at a time when they are not so rushed they can spend more time to make the dishes properly?"}
{"text":"Great diner. The challah French toast is excellent. Big plates with healthy portions. It can be loud at times however. Haven't dined there for lunch or dinner yet, but my family and I have gone there on a busy night just for dessert."}
{"text":"Freaking awesome. This place has everything I want in a restaurant; fresh, quality food that tastes great, reasonable prices, a nice atmosphere, and good service. We actually drove all the way out from our hotel downtown just to check this place out, based on other Yelp reviews, and it was completely worth it. The French Toast is to die for. The sausage is brilliant. Again, great value as well. I was sad to leave, and I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in the Pittsburgh area. BRAVO, Central Diner!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Definitely the place to stop for breakfast in Robinson. The specials are always worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat any meal! Breakfast, lunch or dinner! All the food is great! Salads are huge with all fresh ingredients that are scratch made!"}
{"text":"In my opinion this is a great place. Was there this morning from breakfast. Lots of choices, including. Vegetarian choices. Fantastic service despite the Sunday morning rush. Best breakfast place in the area."}
{"text":"My family loves this diner.  They have something for everyone and all of it is delicious.  The calamari appetizer is the best outside of Little Italy and the soups of the day are delicious and different from the usual offerings at local restaurants.  Portion size is huge!  The smoked applewood bacon is delicious!  Don't forget to save room for dessert :)"}
{"text":"On a freezing Monday morning there were hardly any cars but just from the outside the place looked inviting.  My boyfriend ordered a panini and fries and I ordered the Greek yogurt w/assorted fruit.  They were delicious and huge!  Brought out quickly by a friendly waitress.  I asked for more honey for my yogurt and they didn't charge for it.  Coffee tasty too.  Clean clean clean, a couple of servers were busy wiping windows, doors, glass desert windows.  ( and the cakes looked yummy!) Bathrooms were spotless.  The decor was contemporary and they had booths tables and a bar-type counter.  Chef came out and asked how everything was.  We had to wrap half each to take with us.  So I give this place the best rating.  If someone did not have a good experience here it was probably a rarity, although..... There were not many patrons and we felt catered to."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Central Diner. If you're looking for standard diner food, they've got you covered and they do it in an outstanding fashion. Moreover, they've got an extensive list of Greek food you wouldn't find on a typical diner menu. Oh, and breakfast is great too.  My ONLY complaint about breakfast would be the home fries - they're nothing special and a bit mushy. 

I love the Greek lasagna (can't spell it and it's a nightly special), open-faced gyro platter, steak, and even their wings are great.  My girlfriend especially loves the  salads.  Portions are very big too. 

Their dessert menu consists of Greek delicacies and enormous pieces  of cake that taste great. 5 stars - I can't get enough of this place. In fact, I may have just convinced myself to go there for dinner again tonight."}
{"text":"Busy Sunday, food for 3 of 4 came out 35 minutes after we sat down.  Daughter liked the egg sandwich, wife's omelet was ok. Last meal came out 5 minutes later missing the side of corn beef hash."}
{"text":"It's like Denny's but 100 times better. The food is delicious, its reasonably priced, and the place is very clean. There's also an outside patio which is great for brunch. The manager even walks around asking customers how everything was. That's a nice touch. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Central Diner is exactly what you want in a diner, and a very welcome non-chain option in this stretch of town. Everything about this restaurant is just so fresh and inviting and perfectly thought through. The decor is very modern yet not pretentious and says \"Everyone is welcome here\". The menu is exactly what I want in a Greek diner, as it has all the classics, but it also features interesting updates to the classics for those who want to try something new. For example, their burger menu is a great example of their philosophy as you can get a perfectly good diner burger for about $7 that comes with fries, or for a couple bucks more, you can opt for one of their fancier options like the Greek burger with feta. This is the kind of place that I wish was down the street from me so I could become a regular and try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Desserts are amazing! The cakes are delicious and come from a local bakery. I frequent Central Diner & Grille not only for its conveniently close location to my home but they are welcoming as soon as you walk  through the door. I've dined in and ordered take out with no complaints. The menu is large but you can order breakfast anytime. I recommend if ordering takeout to stick to lunch and dinner items. My personal preference is that when ordering breakfast food, its always best when being served. I love the veggie omelet, followed by the Vegetable Panini.  Want a salad? Pick the Greek salad! Its served with stuffed grape leaves and pita, topped with feta and Kalamata olives.. YUM! Meat eating fiance has enjoyed the cuban and the roast beef sandwich with the hot gravy.  Friendly staff, everything is always clean and tidy, and  even on the busiest days my food has always come out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"This is one of my fiancé's favorite breakfast spots when we are in Robinson so we tried it for dinner! Same thing! We couldn't of been happier. The menu is huge and the portions are too! We order fried calamari for an appetizer and we couldn't believe how much food came out! It was pretty good considering it's called a diner! I had the gyro platter for my main course and she got the stuffed pepper. Everything was delicious and fresh. They went above and beyond when we left, we forgot the bag with the leftovers. They chased us down to the parking lot to make sure we got our food!"}
{"text":"We came to Pittsburgh for the first time and hit this diner for late night. First off the staff was excellent, our server Craig was fine dining attentive. Food was good what one would expect, we did standards, an omelet, a BLT, a Reuben and a veggie panini. Portions were very large, service was fast and food arrived piping hot!"}
{"text":"The exterior of the building is beautiful and the inside comes in close right behind it. The wait staff is typically responsive and speedy. The food selection is both interesting and delicious. I've gone for brunch and dinner - being impressed both times."}
{"text":"Great food at good prices!
I don't know how we missed Central Diner on previous stays in the area but I'm glad we found it tonight.
The waitress recommend the featured chicken section of the menu so I ordered the chicken cordon bleu and my wife went with chicken napolitano - both were outstanding!  The salads were nice and the broccoli sides were steamed just right."}
{"text":"This is a newer restaurant with a very trendy décor and the pricing is fair considering the location (Robinson Twp). The staff could not have been more friendly and we really enjoyed our meals. Delicious food, large portions, friendly staff! Overall great experience had by all! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We're from out of town, so we went here strictly based on reviews from yelp.  I was not disappointed.  The place was very crowded on a Saturday night.  I got the Central burger and my daughter got a grilled cheese.  I loved my burger. She liked her sandwich.  We also split a piece of their 4-layer birthday cake.  I'm not a guy who normally likes frosting, but I really did like this.  Save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"How this place gets high reviews I have no idea. If you like to hear the owners yell at the cooks and eat not that great food , well this might be the place for you. Oh and wait an hour for subpar food!!"}
{"text":"How lucky we were to stop at Central Diner and Grill for dinner, it was fantastic! I had the huge stuffed pepper dinner that included a delicious Greek salad and bread. Stuffed pepper was placed on top of a huge portion of mashed potatoes and covered with a delicious tomato,onion, green pepper sauce, yum! My husband had tasty chicken noodle soup, fresh bread and goulash. The bowl of noodles  was sooo large and the beef melted in your month, flavor was fantastic! I have dinner for tomorrow with our leftovers! Next time I'll have to have dessert to go!  What a lucky stop for us out of towners! This is worth s special weekend away in Pittsburgh in the coming few months from this WNY couple."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a handful of times. The first couple of times, it was good. The last 3 times have been not do good. Today I ordered a Cobb salad. The chicken was super dry. Couldn't even cut it with a knife. My daughter ordered a chicken panini. Same story, chicken horribly over cooked. 

First few times I went there, I felt very welcomed. Not the same now, it seems everything is rushed. There was a big line at register and the owner/manager impatiently waved me through like I was a child or employee he was frustrated with. Icing on the cake was at check out, the girl asked how was everything. I said eh, not so good. She didn't even acknowledge my reply.  Won't be visiting there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Fabulous place for some serious diner food.   We went the other night to check it out based on all the awesome Yelp reviews.  Gotta say, people know their food. This place really delivered.  I had the huge plate of meat meatloaf which was drenched in brown gravy and sautéed mushrooms...like nature intended. My boyfriend had the Jack burger with jalapeño pepper jack cheese and bacon aioli. What?! Yumm!! We also had an enormous slice of the birthday cake and chocolate and peanut butter cake. Uh-MAZING!!!  The biggest problem you'll have here is deciding what you wanna eat because you can get breakfast, salads, burgers, sandwiches, pasta, seafood, chicken, Greek food, and diner comfort food. Not to mention the giant case of deserts. If you haven't tried The Central Diner, you definitely should give it a try. The place is casual and the service was fantastic! Plus you'll probably end up with left overs; a good problem to have!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with another family and everyone had different ideas of what they wanted. We had kids (4 and 6 years), a teenager, and adults in tow and everyone left happy and full!

When you walk in you see the coffee bar and you can feel the vibe as the place is pulsating with life. We sat down and were greeted by our waitress immediately. She took our drink orders and then read the giant list of specials (12 that night) before letting us digest the enormous menu as an appetizer. 

My wife had the black and blue burger which was amazing. It was cooked perfectly and had blue cheese on the top and the bottom. My club sandwich was good and was made with real turkey breast instead of just the shaved lunch meat. The fries were fantastic as well and everyone devoured them. The other diners had dishes ranging from leg of lamb to a huge piece of salmon. Everyone was really happy and then our waitress asked about dessert! 

The cakes and pies were so numerous that she actually handed us her list to look over. From \"death by chocolate\" to carrot cake to raspberry chocolate almond torte we were all impressed. We all took at least half of the giant pieces home for later. We will all be back soon!"}
{"text":"Central Diner & Grille is in a very convenient place - the old Denny's by the Red Roof Inn in Robinson. It's basically a huge open room with no sound barriers so it was very loud. We got there around 6 and the place was packed, although it really cleared out after 7. Service was good and prompt for it being so busy. There were a huge amount of food options and I settled on the London broil sandwich. The meat was great but the bun was very soggy. My sister got a chicken dish that looked awesome, as did the salad my cousin got. Many of the servings were huge. I was a little disappointed in beer options - was looking forward to some local drafts but there were no drafts, let alone local bottles. Their cocktail list looked very promising. I would definitely go back and try out something else, like one of the panini sandwiches or chicken dinner options."}
{"text":"Our group came to Central Diner based on the recommendation of our local colleagues.  We had a very productive, but super long day involving lots of driving and visiting facilities.  Doing some additional work for a few hours back at the hotel and I was getting slightly hangry and irritable at 830pm EST.  

It is impossible to leave Central Dinner hungry - just looking at the desserts display will put Cheesecake Factory to shame.  The restaurant feels like an upscale version of Denny's, except imagine the menu expanded to include Seafood, Greek, and Italian cuisine.  The portion sizes are among the largest I've seen at any restaurant, and at rock-bottom prices.  Overall: 3 stars - food was good, but not spectacular.  Definitely quantity over quality here.

I ordered:

1. Spanakopita Appetizer: Flakey, decent, but wished it was warmer.  Gigantic for an appetizer.  One of my vegetarian coworkers got the entree version which turned out to be 3x the size (I expected 2x) of mine.

2. Italian Wedding Soup: This came as a free side dish with entree.  Pretty good - can't go wrong with meatball soup.

3. Grilled Chicken Plate: Gigantic, so large I could not finish all the carbs.  Chicken white meat grilled and seasoned perfectly and paired with grilled onions and bell peppers on top a huge 6\" diameter flatbread.  Then next to it, a gigantic portion of rice pilaf.  The food was good but overwhelming.

A good place for dinner as they open late.  Maybe best to order just one item each here: appetizer, entree, or dessert since everything is massive here."}
{"text":"I wonder if I came here on an off day because my experience wasn't all that great despite the high rating and several friends telling me the food they've tired here was good. As I sat down, I was reminded of a resort or cruise ship buffet. The tables and booths appeared rather new and they had light elevator music playing. I found the music to be an interesting choice for a diner, which is probably what gave it the cruise ship feel. 

Anyway, I got the two eggs, over-easy, and the husband got the central chicken sandwich. I was pretty disappointed with my meal, which I couldn't understand how a diner could mess up such a breakfast essential. My eggs came with the yolk already broken. My home fries were basically smashed potatoes: no char or crispiness. And the \"toast\" wasn't even toasted! Extremely disappointing. The chicken sandwich was simple, but enjoyable according to the hubby. 

Our service was ok: not incredibly friendly but not exactly rude either. I wasn't a huge fan of Central Diner but I'd be willing to give it another go. I'm convinced I came here on an off day!"}
{"text":"CD is anything but a diner!  The food is marvelous and always consistently excellent. Everything seems to be made from scratch. The Greek specialities are truly Greek. We liked the Chicken Francese so very much that Chris, the manager, took us back into the kitchen to learn how to make it. The atmosphere is casual, but I can't think of another place in Pittsburgh that I would rather have dinner."}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries are my favorite especially dipped in the Greek dressing. I have to stop here at least once a month. Love the eggs Benedict with spinach. It's my favorite!"}
{"text":"Service was very good, food was quick to the table ... almost too quick for made to order.  Food quality was just ok, expected better.  Dining room needs sound dampers, to much noice."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the Central Diner on a suggestion from my parents. We both went in with low expectations for a \"traditional diner\" but everything exceeded our expectations. They were not very busy for 8pm on a Friday night. We sat at the counter. What used to be a former Denny's has been transformed into a stylish diner. Our waiter (who has been there since they opened) did not miss a beat. The menu is vast so we took his dinner suggestion of stuffed peppers and mashed potatoes. Each meal came with a diner salad and warmed Ciabatta bread. The stuffed pepper was the size of a softball, which was stuffed to the brim with deliciousness. It came with a vast amount of sauce and homemade mashed potatoes. We had left overs for the next several meals. We took some chocolate cake home. We had a great experience. We are looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Wonderful diner.  Excellent service even on a busy Sunday morning. I would take this over FirstWatch, although this does tend to be slightly greasy.
I ordered the Spanish omelette with addition of spinach.  The chorizo was good and the sauce on top was delicious.  The potatoes were tasty as well.
My husband ordered the two eggs & bacon, with very generous servings of bacon.
My one complaint would be the lack of freshly squeezed juices.  The rye bread was tasty, although I was hoping for the darker (Jewish?) rye bread that I tend to get in Ohio.
Overall, this was a great start to our day."}
{"text":"Wow!  Pittsburgh finally gets it's first real New Jersey style Diner!!  This place is great...  Owned and operated by a Greek family just like Jersey and the food, quality and portions are the same - excellent!  Our family has been looking for our \"go to\" restaurant and now we have it.

If you've ever been to New Jersey and have eaten at any of the huge diners there you will understand what I am talking about.  New Jersey Greek Family Owned diners are just over the top.  Huge menu selections, great portions, beautiful decor and the quality of the food rivals most traditional sit-down restaurants.  Just great!!!

Thank g-d, we never have to go Eat-n Park or Kings EVER again...Bleeeeaaach....  We Love Central Diner and Grille!!"}
{"text":"Food was typical for a diner - wide selection, large portions, medium quality. Their cake/dessert selection seemed a little broader than most. Service (Seth was out waitor) was first rate - in fact I am surprised Seth works there, he could easily be in a 5 star establishment. Would go again"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent!  I was with a large group and everyone got their meal served hot.  The taste was excellent, the portions large and the service, terrific!  I also like that they have local food offerings such as Sarris ice cream for dessert.  I will return and tell my friends that this is a terrific restaurant!"}
{"text":"First time I have been to the restaurant. It was amazing high class diner food!
Everything was just elevated from usual diner fare. 
There is indoor and outdoor seating, full bar, contemporary decor, fast service, and great food.
The menu is extensive and breakfast(which is of course what the kids got) is served all the time.
The kids raved the breakfast food was better than their usual breakfast staple restaurants!!"}
{"text":"Cobb salad was HUGE!  Definitely not lacking protein. Asked for extra blue cheese and received a BOWL!  unfortunately it tasted like Kraft bottled blue cheese"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Food was hot and very tasty.  I was surprised to see that they serve liquor in a \"diner.\"  It is one large room with high ceilings which made it very loud.  The menu is huge with entree items from $5 to $20.  The waiter was so helpful and took care of us. I very much enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"It was the logical and logistical choice to dine here. I mean, all the stars were aligned pretty much - at least the yelp rating was anyway. 4.5 stars in the average rating and right next door to my hotel - Red Roof Inn Plus+. 

How could I say no? 

Central Diner & Grille was exactly that and more. It was definitely a full-fledged diner and restaurant. I got a event that it was pretty nice inside and and accommodate many many people for a big party or a small gathering. They are pretty much a 24 hour operation because they serve breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even can satisfy late night munchies. They probably serve breakfast all day and night, but you just need to ask whether not they do so. I arrived here on a Tuesday late September evening around 8:30pm. It wasn't crowded and I got seated right away. I was offered the dining area or up front at the bar. I opted for the dining area and sat in a booth. It was nice to have plenty of space for the food and drink. The service here was as good as you can get. Friendly and quite nice for any meal combination that you require for that specific moment in time. I suspect that they get a lot of people for dinner and late night, since they have a full bar going on and the selection of beers is pretty good. While they don't have anything on tap, they sell bottled beers. The overall experience here at Central Diner & Grille was just dinner and it was pretty good. The ambiance of casual was nice and just dining in a quiet setting was enjoyable. 

I must have spent about 45 minutes here from start to finish. Starting out with a Heineken was a nice way to end the day driving from Winchester, VA to here near the Pittsburgh airport area and Central Diner & Grille. The Central Diner & Grille is located at 6408 Steubenville Pike in Pittsburgh. They accept major credit cards, which is always a good thing. Since I was staying next door at the Red Roof Inn Plus+, I didn't need to worry about parking issues, but for the many other patrons here who don't, there is plenty of parking here around the restaurant. The menu at the Central Diner and Grille was quite extensive, half of it went to breakfast and the other half was dedicated to the lunch/dinner menu, along with drinks, desserts, and other side dishes that would make any meal that much more satisfying. For me, this was just dinner and I spent about $20 for everything. It was sort of like dining at a Chili's restaurant though, although they have a nice breakfast selection. Prices here are quite the norm of what you'd find anywhere. $5-6 for breakfast and $10 for lunch entrees. Liquor and beers range from $3 - $6, although I don't know if they have happy hour here or not.

My experience here at Central Diner & Grille is as affordable and delectable as one can imagine it to be. I started off with the aforementioned Heineken. I ordered this mushroom burger, which came with cheese and sautéed mushrooms and onions. I had French fries that came with it, also I ordered a round of corned beef hash, since I haven't had corned beef hash (restaurant style, not canned supermarket style) in a while. The burger itself was great and I ordered it medium rare. It was quite juicy and the bun was soft enough to where it just melted in my mouth. It was just the ideal meal to have after a long day of driving in the mid Atlantic. The French fries were crisp and hot, while the corned beef hash was definitely hits the spot, especially when I haven't had it in so long. It brought back memories from my childhood and that was very very nostalgic for me. If you are in the area and want a good homespun meal, check this place out and you may be surprised on what hidden gems and treats you'd find here at the Central Diner & Grille.

4.0 stars for service and good food. 4.5 stars for the ambiance. The restaurant is very clean and optimized for everyday service.

Support local!

{"text":"Food and service are both great! 
Taken family here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions. But staff, although friendly and service minded, was almost overwhelmed by a packed house. I would come again!"}
{"text":"I went back and this time for breakfast.  It was a lot less crowded this time, so you could tell the wait staff had more time on their hands to focus on their customers rather than running around playing catch-up like mad people.  This time I ordered a cheese omelet with their home fries and toast, coffee, and water.  Overall bill was $13.00 after tip, which felt a little stiff but all of the food items were darn good.

The one things I did want to point out was that the management staff on duty still was walking around helping keep drinks and coffee full for customers while checking in on people.  One, I like that the wait staff can count with that kind of support since nothing annoys me more than eating without a drink on hand.  And Two, you can tell they're not letting their guard down they really want to make it work here at their new location.

I left as a very full and happy customer, so they've earned that fourth star.  Is it five-star caliber?  Not yet, but I definitely hope to return."}
{"text":"Great home cooking. Best French toast that's served with crispy bacon. Desserts as big as a meal."}
{"text":"Portions are huge and wonderfully delicious. Service was fast, attentive and very friendly. I agree with the previous review they really need to take out the word diner from their name they are way above that level."}
{"text":"cool ambiance.  booths and tables and a counter (i think).  great food.  a bit pricey to be called a diner but its not the traditional greasy spoon or rail car diner.  BUT you get heapngs of food.  i was in the mood for a burger and fries (i ordered disco fries, YUMMY, was enough to share with 3 others) and i was quite pleased cause its easy to f up a burger.  would order again.  desert was plentiful and tasted homemade.

if you are doing dinner and a movie at cinemark, skip the chain and come here.  pricepoints are comparable but the food is way better and the service more personalized!"}
{"text":"Had great breakfast after our stay at the red roof motel nearby. nice staff, i think it's owned and operated by one family and so everything is fast, clean and good. the meatlovers omelette is great, the greek-style breakfast too!

big servings for a really good price. luv it!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  We were traveling and looking for a bite before hitting the road after seeing a concert the night before.  We had a very solid breakfast and no complaints.  Seen some great looking plates going by that I'm sure makes this a really great local brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Huge portions. Quick service. Great food. More than enough bacon and good coffee. Frech toast was good but I need it more toasted. Definitely will be back again and again"}
{"text":"What they do to lamb tastes like it should be a sin! Almost everything I've had here has been absolutely delicious. Service is good too. HUGE menu with nice variety. It's got all the convenience of a diner with the taste of a gourmet joint. LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Big thumbs up here. Good food, attentive server, hot host (okay, so I looked...heck, he's cute:) On the real though, I only had breakfast and it's kind of hard to mess that up but there were a lot of good looking dishes I witnessed being delivered to my fellow patrons and they seemed pleased. Our meals were the 2 egg special that comes with bacon, sausage or ham, home fries and your choice of bread.  See, that was easy but they did it well and everything was hot.  Not sure what brand of coffee they're serving up but I have never in my life drank more than 1 cup of coffee at any restaurant, ever.  At the Central Diner I had 4 cups.  LOL  Needless to say I was fully awake by the time we saw our featured movie in 3D up the street at Cinemark.  

You've got to give them a shot.  It's different, like an upscale type of Denny's but with better food.  

 They have a big dessert display case that houses some decadent looking goodies that whisper \"You know you want me\" as you're standing in line waiting to pay...

Can't wait to listen to those little voices in my head and come back to try them out for dinner and dessert."}
{"text":"Had vegetarian panini and substituted wedding soup instead of French fries.  Both very good.  Wedding soup was outstanding, the best I've ever had in any restaurant.

Skip the chain restaurants and try this place!

Staff very friendly and accommodating.  Food made fresh on the premises.  Desserts from signature bakery in new castle they said.  Didn't try but looked awesome in the display case.  Maybe next time cause I will be back"}
{"text":"Had a great deal of time to kill between dropping off my fiancee at the airport and an early afternoon meeting. I'm less familiar with the options on this end of town, but Central Diner was open and came recommended. 

I wasn't overly impressed, but that's likely in part because I didn't get very adventurous in my selection. My omelet was good as expected; others have commented on the potatoes being bland. I didn't think they were bland, they were simply unseasoned. I do agree that such an adjustment would add some zest to them. My only (minor) complaint is that the bacon -- while good -- was greasier than you'd expect. 

That said, the food was good, and it's a lot of food for the money. Even the side of bacon that I ordered was about double the size of what I typically expect. Some folks have commented on the coffee here. It isn't bad, but it's pretty standard. 

Overall, nice atmosphere, attentive staff, good food, and they didn't mind that I lingered around to get some work done in advance of my meeting. I would absolutely return, though I would likely go for a special next time to get a better sense of what they can do here."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while staying in Settlers Ridge on bidness. Hailing from North Jersey I'm always a little skeptical of picking a diner for a wholesome meal but Central Diner is in a diner echelon of its own. 

They have a Greek flair to their menu but there are a lot of non-Greek options. I went with the chicken athena to go a little greek and it was perfect, I would order it again before trying something else on a return visit. 

All in all a great diner experience. Flawless service, quick seating and really really good food."}
{"text":"Came for \"early\" dinner around 5pm Wednesday, but still busy. Service was excellent and food very good. Four of us tried spanakopita, (daily special) pastitcio, and scallops to split. 

Greek items were not as strongly spiced as you'd find in Greece, but still taste authentic. Big portions and plates all included choices of soup, salad. Varied menu includes burgers, Greek, Italian, steak, breakfast. 

Give it a try! Take a to-go box and save room for dessert...it looked great."}
{"text":"In my adventures in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania this has been the best dinner place so far. The awesome menu says it and has it all. The have a beautiful and quite outside patio. All of our dishes were amazing and delicious, come with an appetite cause portions are Texas size. Also make room for their homemade desserts. Our waiter Seth was amazing, he made our dinning experience that much better."}
{"text":"This place was great. The decor was a little quirky but the food was amazing. Fresh and comforting at the same time. Lots of food...maybe a little wasteful. 
The waitress was awesome! Very helpful and friendly. We we in Pittsburgh on business and went here based on yelp reviews. We weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"Our first time in Pittsburgh, we were staying at the Hyatt Place across the street and came in for a late night meal. All 7 of us were impressed with our meals as well as our service. I had the chicken Panini with pesto and roasted tomatoes it was delicious to say the least. Portions were large so we had plenty to wrap up and save for lunch tomorrow. If we are ever in town again we'll be sure to stop by. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times for a Family Luncheon.

Food and Service is always Top Notch and the Owner usually will stop by to say hello ."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a grab bag... Sometimes I go and have a great service and great food and other times the service is bad but the food is good and other times the service is good but the food is bad so I almost don't even know how to review the place but numerous times I did have food that was dry and not the best"}
{"text":"Always love this place!! Breakfast is my fave. You cannot leave hungry. Portions are huge. Bloody Mary great!!"}
{"text":"Almost all times I have been here have been fabulous. Their French toast is AMAZING. Also, best bacon you can eat at a restaurant. There eggs whether you get them scrambled or over easy are cooked to perfection. Not to mention the reasonable prices and big portions. This is for sure a place where you get your bang for your buck. This morning in particular, I got coffee, 2 eggs, home fries and toast all for $7.25, not a bad deal at all. The service is great and everyone is super friendly. The only negative I have to say is the home fries are  a bit bland, but I'm sure if you were a ketchup person you wouldn't even notice. Also, I think their coffee could be better. They exceed immensely in all other categories though and I hate even saying a negative, but just wanted to get that out there. 

If they improved their coffee and even added more selections dealing with coffee additions and such, I would give 5 stars. Other than that, I would very much so pick this restaurant over any chain breakfast place. AMAZING SERVICE AND ATTENTIVE STAFF."}
{"text":"My mother raves about this place. She comes here every chance she gets for breakfast. She loves the veggie omlet. My step dad loves everything.

I don't eat breakfast so I just had a coffee and eat my moms toast. Which was lovely rye toast. 

But I note and write a review cause the staff were awesome! Very tentive and kept coming back to fill our coffees. Big mistake cause we made a long drive after! 

Everyone was friendly!"}
{"text":"I came in here early on a Saturday morning for breakfast and found it to be a good solid choice. I just didn't see anything, though, too much out of the ordinary. Maybe I need to try some other items on the menu to see if it might merit more than three stars. 

I had a basic egg breakfast with Canadian bacon. The over easy eggs were cooked fine, and the home potatoes were really good. I have no complaints about the Canadian bacon. The breakfast came with a couple of pieces of buttered toast. Nothing was too out of the ordinary, but that might have more to do with the menu choice I made.  The coffee was nothing special. 

The restaurant itself is large, clean and modern looking, but just a little too generic looking.  I took a look over the menu and it was huge. They offer something for every taste. I would definitely give this diner another try. The cakes behind the counter looked scrumptious."}
{"text":"Excellent diner.  I had the big fat Greek omelette for breakfast and it was excellent.  Open at 6am.  Excellent service. Recommended!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like Central Diner for breakfast.  Him:  bagel all the way (lox, cream cheese, onion, capers, etc.).  Me:  eggs over easy with ham, home fries and English muffin.  It is usually always good but every so often the home fries taste \"old\" and the English muffin isn't toasted enough.  Not the best bagel and lox he has eaten but good.  One time when something didn't taste right, manager took it off the bill.  Service is always good!"}
{"text":"I brought a friend from out of town here and we both enjoyed our lunch!  Even though the parking lot was full, we still got seated immediately.  I ordered a Greek entree and it was huge!!  Quantity doesn't mean a lot without quality, and the quality was as good as the Greek food that I had while traveling through Greece!  Darcy, our waitress, took good care of us; we never had less than a half cup of coffee, and she was very nice.  Speaking of coffee, their coffee is great too!
I look forward to my next visit!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Great food, HUGE portions, great service. Wonderful menu variety, incredible specials.  Every plate we saw looked delicious. The mangers or possibly owners came around 3 times to check on us. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was surprised by how good this place was, especially with a \"diner\" name and a few of the Yelp reviews referring to it being a Denny's before.  Overall I give it a 5 star!

The restaurant layout is like a Denny's, but in no way does it feel, look, or taste like one.  The interior is very clean, with the staff constantly cleaning the tables and floors. That's a plus!  

The food was pretty tastey and portion sizes were superior.  I got the gyro plate and was amazed how big it was.  Bigger than most hole in the wall Greek places. Plenty if meat and fixings to fill the pita. Became messy, but I think that was due to the user's (me) inability to master eating a gyro gracefully. :) The side of cole slaw was very fresh, with a hint of sweetness to excite the taste buds. I also got a cup of wedding soup.  Tastes homemade, and therefore recommend getting it if you would like a hot bowl of soup. 

Now to the best part... The dessert!  I wanted to get their German chocolate cake (due to the tastey pictures on yelp), but they were out.  So I opted for the carrot cake.  Omg mmmmm!  Very fresh and full of all the right ingredients that make a carrot cake full of flavor, moist in your mouth, and ultimately complete the meal.  I am eager to try the other cakes and expect them to be of the same enjoyment. 

Finally, the staff are top notch.  Very friendly and aim to provide a very enjoyable eating experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Seth is a great waiter. Portions are large. Plan to take home leftovers. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice and won't be back for a third time.  This place has awful food and terrible service.  An omelet looks like a train wreck on the plate and the meat lovers omelet doesn't have much meat.  The toast gets delivered half way through eating breakfast and it's burnt.  The breakfast potatoes look like someone already ate them.  Are they raising flies in that building.  I spent more time swatting at flies than I did eating.  I had better food in a military chow hall."}
{"text":"By far one of our favorite places to go to. We've never had anything bad happen here. Fantastic service to fantastic food everytime. The portions are crazy large and so fresh. Tonight's dinner for the wife gets the exposure as it was a special. Salmon and crab cake. Talk about a fresh dish and she was only able to eat about half of it. We love this place."}
{"text":"The food was fresh, cooked beautifully, and delicious!  The staff was friendly and attentive, and the owner came out to make sure all was going well.  I'm only giving five stars because I can't give six!"}
{"text":"We dine here once a week on average. We've had a few speed bumps but they've always gone out of their way to make it right. Often restaurants that have this much selection have too much going on and just can't make anything well; not \"The Diner\". Priced well and generous portions. This place is great for burgers, breakfast, or seafood. They often have an unusual take on dishes so be sure to point out if there are any ingredients you just can't eat - peppers in the Cordon Bleu."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  Upscale diner food at its best.  Make sure you get desert!"}
{"text":"Bring your starving masses. The servings are huge and the food is excellent.  All of the staff is exceptional. The diner is packed and noisy. The prices are reasonable. Wait until you see the desserts- amazing"}
{"text":"I'm in Pittsburgh for a sales meeting and at the last moment we needed to get reservations for 18 of us. The folks at the central diner were fantastic, and accommodated our group.    Now let me tell you I'm a big man and I can pack food away but the quality given to each of us was absolutely unreal.   Our local guest ordered dessert as an appetizer, we all laughed about it but he said that the last time he was there he didn't have room for dessert and wanted to make sure he got the homemade rice pudding.  Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, yes that's right I'm going to order dessert as an appetizer"}
{"text":"Food is great atmosphere is great however, if you get a to go order its half the portion at same price as if you were dining in. Also, I observed that the owner is always what appears to be a \"ticked\" off demeanor especially in talking to his employees."}
{"text":"This is the best place to take a large group of people out to eat when in Pittsburgh!  The staff is great, the food is good at a decent price and the portions are HUGE!  So I always have my leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant's daily specials and the service. It's always nice to see the owners walking around and making sure that all of the patrons are happy and helping out their waitstaff when needed."}
{"text":"Visited yesterday and sat in our favorite server's, Seth, section. We hadn't been there in months but he remembered our drink and appetizer preferences. For dinner I had the Seafood Fra Diavolo. Spicy. Delicious. And a large portion of seafood. The wife had the Egglplant Parmesan.
Everything was fantastic, and this continues to be one of my favorite places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"07-23-2016 Visit - I always wanted to stop here but always forgot about it and usually drove by after eating somewhere else and saying \"I should have stop here\".. Seems like the parking lot is always full... A big sign of a good diner. 

I forget exactly what I ordered,, since I am writing this review late, but all in all the whole enjoy their meal. The menu is huge and was hard deciding what to eat. the only Compliant I had I was expecting the huge plate of food.. Both me and my son was surprised. I already knew it was going to be big by looking at everyone plates as we walked to our table. So if you come here make sure you are good and hungry. 

I think this would be easily a 5 star rating in my books but I need to eat more here and try out dishes and see what I like. but for a first time being here I was really impressed"}
{"text":"Was as good as the reviews say. Sat at the bar and had the Jack burger. Food was great and quick. Seth took great care of me. If I am ever back in Pittsburgh I will visit again."}
{"text":"My boyfriends suggestion. Central was nice, clean, great atmosphere the souvlaki was great and my boyfriend enjoyed his crab cakes (warning: the cakes are no longer on the menu but they still offer it.) Our first date. We will return."}
{"text":"We decided to come here because my child wanted a cheesesteak and wings. And it was super close to our hotel. It was busy but the wait was not too bad. We were seated in the closed in heated patio area which was just fine with me since there was only a few tables and so noisy. They have a large selection of food and the giant cakes in our display case looked really good. We ordered the buffalo wings which I just knew was going to be some version of frozen wings but to my surprise th ey were freshly fried and and tossed in sauce. The onion soup was yummy. I ordered one of the dozen specials, pastitsio, a greek version of lasagna but with ground lamb and bechamel sauce. It was huge! And delicious! My hubby ordered the fried fish sub which was fresh and the fish was bigger than the sub roll. My son got the philly cheesesteak which was decent! We got dessert to go because the cakes looked amazing. They were good but not amazing as they looked though. We went back the next morning for breakfast and our meals were delicious. They are definitely consistent on providing great food and service."}
{"text":"I really like Central Diner. 

It's a proper diner, with a large menu covering all the bases:  breakfast all day, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, steaks, pot roast, etc. 

Our service was great - the server visited our table frequently, refilling drinks, checking on us, and taking away empty dishes. 

Portions are quite large, so you can spilt most dishes, or plan to have some leftovers (don't leave it, take it home!).

I'll be back."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed.
Flew into Pittsburg, we were starving and looking for a place to eat lunch close to the airport. 
Great reviews and decided to give it a try.
Was sat and greeted immediately even during the lunch rush. Lots of tables and seating.
Menu is great with wonderful Greek food choices. Every server and employee seem well trained, attentive and caring of your dining experience. 
Food was fresh and portions huge.
If we return to the area, we will be back."}
{"text":"Overall I liked Central Diner.  The menu offers a lot of options and the owner is very attentive to his customers.  I had the Sliced London Broil Sandwich with fries.  The sandwich was delicious but for the price a few more slices of meat wouldn't have hurt.  The fries were of the battered variety, which I am not a fan of even though I am finding them at more and more restaurants.  For dessert, I went with the rich Chocolate Layer Cake.  It was okay, but I think I really should have gone for the cheesecake.

The building itself used to be a Denny's, so it feels more like your typical casual dining restaurant and less like a diner.  Also, when the place is even a little busy the noise level reaches high levels.  Our waitress could have checked on us a bit more.  I had to go to the front counter because I got tired of waiting for her to ask if we needed anything else.

I struggled with 2 or 3 stars.  My bill, with tip, was $20.  This seemed steep to me (especially when my drink was water).  I think the price is the biggest obstacle I have in really liking Central Diner.  But I would like to go back for breakfast so ultimately I landed on 3 stars.  We'll see if the rating goes up after another visit."}
{"text":"The place was crowded! And the noise level went up to the maximum. The acoustics of the room was terrible and people tried to make up for that by raising their voices more and more. We were 4 people in a booth and had a hard time to converse. Very broad food selection.Food was good, very generous servings. Almost everybody left the place with a doggy bag. :-)"}
{"text":"Are you ever hungry and not quite sure what you want? Then this is the answer! The Central diner is what you would expect from a diner style restaurant and way more. It really is not your typical diner, but one that has elevated to the status of a \"foodie favorite\". Sure you can get a great traditional breakfast, lunch or dinner that will satisfy anyone in your party's craving because the menu covers it all and with a hint Greek favorites as a bonus. But the menu here offers so many options like the traditional favorites, but they also daily specials as well as unique options you will not find at your typical diner establishment.

Breakfast is a favorite here when we are planning a day of shopping. It is a great way to start the day. Forget the chain restaurants that are surrounding the area, unless you want mediocre food. Go here and try a different daily special. You won't be disappointed.

My only complaint is that I don't live close enough to stop here more often to be able to try even more items they offer. I want to try just about anything in their bakery case. Just looking at some of the cakes and goodies is truly a delight! The cakes are amazing!

The restaurant itself is designed in a contemporary style and tastefully decorated. The service is fast and efficient. The restaurant is very clean and can be very busy at times. Prices are reasonable for an upscale diner.

This has become a favorite of ours and is added to our list of \"go to\" places when in the area. Do yourself a favor and \"go there\" too!"}
{"text":"This place is legit!! 

I had a rib platter with fries and my wife had the biggest piece of lasagna you have ever seen! 

The ribs were fall on my bone tender, and the lasagna tasted so good it completely flooded my basement! It looks like they have some awesome desserts, if you can save enough room! I know we couldn't."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in the Robinson area. Large menu, daily specials, huge portions, and good wait staff. This place is always packed and for good reason. The food is fantastic. I always love looking at what is going to the other tables to see what I might get on my next trip there. Give this place a try. Well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best American Breakfast I had by far. With this quality, the bill we paid was negligible."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here several times and haven't been able to find anything to complain about. This restaurant is family owned with a Greek flair but has many other options. They serve breakfast all day, have sandwiches as well as large \"nicer\" entrees and always have awesome specials. The portions are huge, prices are reasonable, open late, and they serve alcohol despite being called a diner. Staff is always really friendly, nice atmosphere. Outdoor seating available

The Greek salad is my go to, the home made Greek dressing is so good.
Lemon chicken soup is amazing
Eggs Benedict are huge!
Shepards pie was also huge and so good.

Definitely worth a visit"}
{"text":"We hv eaten here nany times. Always a delicious meal. The portions r large. I ususlly leave with a leftover. Box. try the stuffed cabbage.   tastes homemade"}
{"text":"This place always has a crowd and for a good reason. Great mix between a diner and a sit down restaurant. They have great breakfast specials and a Greek inspired lunch /dinner menu without losing the traditional diner fare. I've been here a few times and have never left disappointed. The portions are large, so be prepared to take home leftovers! Oh, and you HAVE to save room for dessert. They have a display case at the front with the most delicious looking cakes that are made by a local bakery."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They have a variety of food ranging from sandwiches to Italian and Greek dishes.  We ate here twice over the weekend.. since this seemed to be the best place around. 
One thing we learned from our first visit was that their portions are huge !!!! so next time we just ordered one meal and it was enough for the two of us. Their desserts are amazing too. They have 4 layer cakes which are gigantic.. and must be shared :)
The service is quick and those guys work really fast. I sat in front of the kitchen on the bar.. and I was impressed how co-ordinated the cooks were, and how quickly they fixed orders in case a customer changed their mind or there was a mistake. 
This place is great for groups, and with a wide variety of food, I am sure everyone can find something they would enjoy."}
{"text":"Visiting the Pittsburgh area found this place and it was delicious. We ate the both days we was there."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!   Had Greek  salad & spinach pie.  Dinner included bread that tasted homemade.  Portions were very generous - enough for a second meal.   Server was very friendly and attentive.   Wish I'd had room for dessert - they looked fabulous!   :-)  I highly recommend this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Even though the name \"diner & grille\" might sound petite and quaint, this is quite a large venue with lots of space, whether at tables or at a counter, a reasonably bright, modern feel throughout, and plenty of parking outside.

The menu is quite large and has just about all the comfort food you want. Breakfast fare wasn't necessarily the best I've ever had, but certainly lives up to diner standards and was incredibly well-priced and well-portioned, so much so that I didn't need to eat much for the rest of the day. Service is fairly quick and efficient, if perfunctory. 

A decent place to visit if you're in the immediate area and don't want to wait terribly long on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"This place in general has great all day breakfast, lunch, and dinner options with a Greek/Mediterranean twist. Writing this now, I've been here more than once to try their omelettes (specifically the Big Fat Greek Omelette & Nova Scotia Lox/Onion Omelette), waffles, pasta (Pasta Fra Diavolo), appetizers (fried calamari), and soup (French onion) and found all of them to be quite delicious. This place can definitely get busy during evenings and weekends so be prepared if you are coming at any of these times. Specifically in regards to the food, I found the ingredients in all the omelettes to be quite fresh. The calamari is also authentic, which is much appreciated, seeing as most places do not use real calamari when they offer it. The waffles are also quite delicious too ... the one I ordered was one with strawberries, bananas, laced with honey and it was probably one of the best waffles I've had. The soup was also quite flavorful and filling ... not too salty, but also with enough flavor to leave one satisfied. Overall, I'm impressed at their offerings along with good, quick, friendly, and efficient service. Prices can be higher for the pasta, seafood, and specialty (Italian and Greek) dishes so consider yourself warned ahead of time. It can also be quite loud during busy times so it may not be the most ideal for quiet meetups if that is what one is looking for. Overall, a great choice of diner for all-day breakfast, lunch, or dinner although it's a little bit of a drive from the city itself. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Fiance took me here this weekend for dinner as he found this gem during the work week a few days back and couldn't wait for me to try it. He was right. IT WAS FANTASTIC. 

The service here is absolutely untouchable. I don't think I have had the level of customer service that they are providing here in QUITE a long time. It was a Saturday night - so it was very busy. Lobby was packed to the brim - always a good sign for me, as you KNOW its that good if people are lining up out the door. We only waited about 15 minutes for our table. The manager of this place is VERY involved.The hostess accidentally called our name for our table before it was ready. We had to wait again. Meanwhile, I watched the manager give orders around him to the various waiters and busboys -which by the way - were HUSTLING and working their butts off at this place. It was pretty refreshing to see. He led us personally to our table as the hostess has slipped the first go round. I was impressed. 

Our waiter was fantastic. Very accommodating, polite, friendly. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. After talking to him after we had finished our meal he told us it was his first week working there. I was SO impressed. We would have never known. Whatever the owner is doing here - he is doing it RIGHT. His staff is well trained and treat people like real people, not like inconveniences. 

We had the buffalo wings as an appetizer. OH MY GOD. Probably one of the best plates of wings I have had in a really long time. They were smoking hot, freshly cooked - no frozen chicken drumsticks here. They were breaded with cornflakes and SO crispy without being overly breaded. The sauce they were tossed in was just the right amount of spice but was full of flavor. You can tell it was homemade sauce, not a bottle of Franks red-hot with some butter melted into it.  We didn't even talk or look up at each other until the platter was empty. SO good. 

Fiance had the monte cristo for an entree and I had the gyro sandwich. Both dishes came with homemade coleslaw, pickles and french fries. Fries were hot and crispy - not cold and soggy. The coleslaw was freshly made and on the sweeter side (a little too sweet for my taste, but still delicious!). The monte cristo was served on homemade challah bread french toast and had REAL roasted turkey and giant chunks of freshly carved salty ham. SO GOOD. The gyro sandwich I had was the best I have ever had. Ever. Ever. It had so much meat packed into the pita that I couldn't even finish it. The meat was fresh and flavorful and the tzatziki sauce was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I could tell it was freshly made that day, in house. I asked for extra, it was so good! 

We will definitely be back again and again and again. Worth the drive no matter where you live in the city!"}
{"text":"My family & I have frequented this establishment many times. 
The portions are very generous for the price. The menu is diverse but the best part of all this is the taste of the food. 
Everything is always so good. 
I recommend the rice pudding. Yum. 
Friendly & prompt service too. 
You can't ask for much more than that. 
Breakfast, lunch dinner, desserts or just cocktails. 
There's something for everyone."}
{"text":"I used to love this place...I walked out today. 35 minutes for a grilled cheese sandwich??? A server who came with water but never once stopped back to see if anything else was needed?? She came back when I got up to leave and said your sandwich will be out soon...really??? How long does a grilled cheese take at 230 in a nearly empty restaurant. Managers didn't care at all. I was in this place at least once a week but then service started going wrong....still there 2 to 3 times a month. Never had such a bad experience. Too many restaurants in that area to waste time and money there..my grilled cheese at home was just as good and cost a lot less."}
{"text":"Great customer service, good food, be aware of the large amount of food you will receive! The challah bread French toast is incredible!!!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things from a co-worker, but didn't believe the hype.  This is as good as it gets for breakfast food in the Pittsburgh area.  We came in on a Saturday around 11 am.  The place was unbelieveably packed, but we had a table within 2 minutes.  They were quickly cleaning and seating like a well-oiled machine.  Our waiter arrived seconds later.  It's rather loud inside, but he was polite and quick to lean in to hear to make sure that he got our order correct. 

We both started with water and then I ordered the big fat greek omelet with french fries, rye bread and no tomatoes.  J ordered the club sandwich also with fries. 

Both items came out super fast and very hot.  My omelet was huge - filled with gyro meat (which was delicious and not greasy), onions, feta cheese with a glob of almost spicy tatziki sauce, brimming with cucumbers.  The toast was slathered with butter and toasted to a crisp perfection.  But what really blew my mind were the fries.  The fries were perfection.  Crispy, not greasy, potato-y - all in all,  they might be the BEST french fries ever.  These beat the fancy fries with truffle oil and parmesan.  They beat the double-fries Belgian frites (in fact, these might be double-fried).  All in all, the massive, and I mean, massive pile disappeared before my eyes.   J's club had hand-carved turkey that had been freshly roasted, fresh tomatoes and lettuce and delicious bread.  

As we were sitting and munching through our meal, I saw the list go up for the dinner specials.  Leg of lamb?  Pastitsio?  Moussaka?  Stuffed pork chops?  I am honestly not kidding when I say that we were considering going back for dinner. 

We will be returning soon!

(And they have a full bar and desserts that look to die for!)"}
{"text":"These folks have it going on. I came here for breakfast twice in a row. The service amazing, the server was very friendly and had my meal out to me in five minutes!! I never had to ask for a coffee refill. Portions are huge and delicious. I travel a lot and am always looking for that gem of a place. This is it and I will definitely visit them again when I am in the area. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Once again Yelpers don't disappoint. This was a solid recommendation with great service and food. The lemon chicken soup is awesome!! Just the right amount of chicken and lemon flavor. Then you dip sourdough bread into and it's !!! For dinner, I had the tuna and salmon with sweet potato fries. Loved it with some orange and lemon on it (fish) and the fries were well cooked."}
{"text":"Had brunch here today and I have to say it was really good. The little man had to go potty so Bryan got a table and when the waitress came to the table Vince asked for crayons and I have to say I think it blew his mind. He was given a big box full of crayons. He was so happy. The food was also really good. Bryan and I both had omelets and Vincent had a pancake. All were fast and fresh. The only thing I can maybe complain about is that I wish the home fries had a bit more seasoning on them but other then that this place is a great diner."}
{"text":"I was disappointed, it says it's a diner but it seems to be trying to be something more and just misses.  It had the greasy down pat but was not the silver spoon as another yelper reported.  I love Greek but did not have the confidence to order it here.  When the staff pronounces Gyro with a soft \"G\" instead of a \"Y\" as in year-o the authenticity is shot.  I opted for the diner food... potato skins, one of the four halves was still cold in the middle.  I followed that with the buffalo burger...no it's not buffalo but has a little buffalo sauce on top-more on the table for those who want to actually taste it.  The blue cheese was generous, the onions grilled well and the burger a previously frozen patty that was gray all the way through-a far cry from the medium I ordered.  Our server was quite pleasant, we sat outside which was nice as it was freezing inside.  I won't be back, too many other options."}
{"text":"Wow! This was not at all what I expected from a diner. When we arrived we had to wait but was definitely worth it. The menu has a broad selection so there is definitely something for everyone. I had the chicken napolitano with penne pasta and the Greek salad. The salad was awesome! Lots of cheese and olives and the dressing tasted great. The entree had two huge chicken breasts and lots of mushrooms and red peppers. I'm not a fan of eating red peppers but I like the flavor. They were in slices so were easy to eat around. It was very good. My husband had the chicken Mediterranean which he said was very good as well. He had the red clam chowder.  My husband came a few nights ago and had the shepherds pie. He said that while it is not the traditional style it was very good. They bring out a bread basket as well which was fresh. We didn't have room for dessert but we took a slice a carrot cake and red velvet to go. The red velvet was good but the carrot cake was to die for. My husband travels here for work and said this will now be his go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped  in for breakfast and had the western. Portions were huge and tasted great. However., with only on waitress on duty in a very busy environment the service sucked. I had to wait  quite a while and then had to flag her down for a water refill. I never did get a coffee refill."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, with huge portions. The service is by far the best service ive ever had.  The owners actively manage the restaurant,  one of them is there everytime we are there.  They come around and check on you while you are eating.  They certainly go above and and beyond the call of ownership management. The eggs benedict is my favorite, the fruit is always fresh and the lunch and dinner options are plenty! I can't say enough great things about the place.  We eat here atleast 3 times month"}
{"text":"Sorry I can't give Central Diner more than a five. The food is awesome, the staff are friendly and accommodating and the prices are great. 

The portions are huge. Have never left here without a take out container. 

Everything we have ever have here has been freshly prepared and delicious. The Gyro salad is huge!  The daily specials on the board as you enter are well worth checking out. 

If you are hungry and want good food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to have breakfast here recently and was very impressed. A very popular spot on the weekends. 

The place was full but despite the high volume of diners the service was excellent. 

We all had some amazing pancakes, blueberry in mine. Load of blueberries, and a delicious light and fluffy pancake. 

Great coffee and a very tasty sausage accompanied the pancakes. 

A definite recommendation for anyone in the Pittsburgh airport vicinity."}
{"text":"Horrible experience today for our Fathers Day brunch! Firstly, We order a mimosa, it comes only halfway full, we take it back to the bar ourselves and ask for a full glass the bartender asks me do I want to pay for a double then I said no just to have my glass filled all the way so I say never mind I don't want it. Secondly, a diff server brings food to our table similar to what we've ordered, meanwhile it's for the table next to us, as we already started to eat off of it, then our server comes out and says oh no that's not yours and takes it back. Thirdly, our bacon wasn't well done as we requested and our server hands us our plates to grab ourselves instead of her setting them down as well as her literally making us hand her our plates when we're finished eating with her hand out. Lastly, she hands us our bill and our total balance said $0.00, so we ask her at the front if it was a mistake, all this time with having an attitude towards us and not nice, and didn't even tell my husband happy Father's Day with our daughter right next to him! Just All around bad experience here at Central Grille. We will never be returning again!"}
{"text":"My new favorite diner!

They have a large menu and are open late night! There seems to be a Greek theme.

Breakfast, bagels, pancakes, lunch, dinner, seafood!

I tried the Eggs Benedict Florentine, delicious and large portions!

Then there were the cakes.... Ohhhh the cakes....

I tried the Carmel, Apple,  Walnut cake!

Ps: They have 2 outdoor patios!"}
{"text":"I am gluten free, which can make dining out challenging, but I cannot say enough positive things about every experience I've had here, both before going gluten free and now.

Service is always top-notch; you can tell the owners and employees truly care about your dining experience, the taste and quality of your meal, etc. And portion sizes...huge! My first time eating here gluten free was no exception. While there is no gluten free menu, my server was well-versed in what was gluten free, from basic knowledge down to what entrees and even salad dressings are GF. Her recommendations were awesome and she even made sure to note that my meal needed to be gluten free for the kitchen staff. 

Fantastic, fantastic experience! I am so happy that I can continue to eat here despite dietary needs."}
{"text":"As I've reviewed more restaurants, I've found that my standards have become increasingly exacting, and that I award fewer 5 star reviews.  Despite this, Central Diner and Grille impressed me sufficiently that I feel justified in awarding this rating.  It's hands down the best diner I've ever been to, by far.

As a city dweller, I rarely make it all the way out to Robinson.  When a Yelp event at a nearby business led me and CM there this weekend, I suggested that we check it out for dinner beforehand.  I described it to him as an upscale diner, but this doesn't really do it justice--it's more of a casual dining-type place that happens to offer breakfast foods all day long, and to be open late.  Also true to the diner name, it offers a variety of desserts, as well as Greek foods, given that the owners, like the owners of many East Coast diners, are Greek.  However, its staple foods are classic American dishes, and they have enough of a variety to satisfy many different tastes.

In light of the specialization in Greek food, I decided to order the Chicken Athena ($16.95), a Greek-influenced chicken dish, and CM decided to order a gyro ($8.95).  In addition to its eponymous dish, my meal came with a choice of soup or salad and side dish, as well as bread.  In keeping with the Greek theme, I decided to try the soup of the day, avgolemono, a Greek lemon-chicken soup.  I'd never tried this soup before, but it was very flavorful, and had a nice thickness.  The bread was a step up from what you'd expect at a casual dining establishment--it was fresh and had a nice body.  For my side dish, I went with the mashed potatoes, which were pretty standard.  As for the Chicken Athena, the first thing that was immediately apparent was its size--it was served on a platter larger than the placemat in front of me, and consisted of two large breasts topped with half a bag of spinach, as well as a generous helping of tomatoes and feta.  Wow!  The taste was on point, too--the freshness of the ingredients was quite evident.  I ate half of it and took the other half home, which I ate for dinner the next day.  CM's gyro was also massive, and came with a generous helping of fries, which were of the lightly battered variety.  He really enjoyed it, saying that it was almost as good as the one he'd had at the PGH Greek Food Fest, which is high praise.  His only minor criticism was that he wished it came with more tzatziki sauce, since he enjoyed its flavor so much that he wanted more!  (We probably could have asked for extra, but it didn't occur to us.)

Although the food was quite good, what earns Central a full 5 stars from me is its atmosphere and service.  In PGH--at least, in the city, al fresco dining is hard to come by, and Central has as many outdoor tables as they do indoor ones.  Since the weather was nice, we were able to take advantage of it, and it was awesome.  As a diner, Central is a family friendly restaurant, and several families with kids opted for the outdoor seating, which gave the kids an opportunity to blow off some steam.  Nevertheless, between the nice weather, the music, and the patio furniture, the atmosphere was comparable to some of the better restaurants I've been to in PGH.  The service was also impressive--our waitress came back to our table to offer me gravy for my mashed potatoes after overhearing me mention that I'd like some to CM, and the owner stopped by to ask me how everything was, and even offered to fill my water glass after we'd asked for the check.  It was clear that this is an extremely well-run, customer-focused restaurant.

CM and I enjoyed our time at Central so much that we returned after attending our event to enjoy dessert and after-dinner drinks on the porch while watching the sun set.  I ordered the death-by-chocolate cake ($4.95), and he ordered a hot chocolate with whipped cream ($1.85).  Although the waitress described the cake as all chocolate, this wasn't quite true, since the cake itself was yellow--it had chocolate icing and was drizzled with chocolate syrup.  Nevertheless, it was quite tasty, and the icing was high quality (CM compared it to his grandmother's).  CM enjoyed his hot chocolate so much that he used a spoon to sip it to make it last longer.

Overall, we were extremely pleased with our meal(s) at Central.  I'd love to return sometime for breakfast, which I'm sure is just as good as--if not better than--dinner, or for another dessert.  I'm positive Central would be a huge hit with my parents, who are picky eaters, or with children.  If you happen to be in Robinson and are tired of mediocre chain restaurant dining, or are on the hunt for a great diner, be sure to check this place out--you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Over priced , Greasy,  bad sad service, arrogant owner or managers who scream at staff. 
I had high hopes and they were dashed to dust.
Been there 3 times different days and times and i am always upset we choose to go there."}
{"text":"The Central never disappoints. Great food, huge portions. Friendly staff. Fantastic, whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner or a late night bite. I can't wait to come back for more. Such a variety and everything is great, try to save room for dessert ( it's not easy)"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here this week. The decor is very nice and I like their color scheme. Service was pleasant and quick. My coffee cup was filed regularly and the waitress was pleasant. 

On to the food. Two of us got the special of the day, French Toast Napoleon.  This was a challah bread French toast with strawberries, bananas, walnuts and honey. In addition, you had a choice of sausage or bacon. The toast was delicious. Nicely browned with an excellent flavor. The berries and bananas were fresh and ripe. No syrup was necessary on this entree. The portions were huge and we could have split this and been satisfied. 

My husband had an omelet that he said was very good. The only issue was that my daughter ordered eggs over medium and they arrived over easy. 

Very enjoyable meal. I will be happy to go back the next rikme we are in he area."}
{"text":"A birthday meal is a birthday meal, whether you buy it for yourself or not.  I recently celebrated a birthday and didn't want to impose myself on others, so I took it upon myself to find a nearby place while out shopping and with a quick look at a Yelp map came across this place.  I love a diner and when I saw that it the moniker I had to come here.

I arrived at a busy time, but that didn't impact my service at all.  When I walked in I was about to be sat at a booth or table before I said I would be fine sitting at the counter.  I appreciated the concern for my comfort, but I wanted to see how well this place was run.  And it was run like a well oiled machine.  

While looking at the menu I was greeted by a smile and a glass of water.  I asked for a few minutes to look over the menu and was left to be for a few minutes.  While looking over the menu you notice that they take the diner menu and go upscale with it, I'll touch on that a bit later.  After skimming descriptions of items on the menu I found what I was looking for.  My go to for a diner, meatloaf.  I can't tell you why it's always meatloaf at a diner for me, but it always is.  Whether it's a meatloaf sandwich or just a pile of sliced meatloaf, to me that is a diner style meal.  This meatloaf was to come with mushroom gravy, a side and either soup or salad.  I had asked to keep the mushrooms off the plate, opted for a side of mashed potatoes with gravy, and a house salad with ranch dressing.

The salad was a nice blend of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and red onions.  No need to ask for extra dressing here as they give you a generous portion.  No sooner did I finish the salad than my main course showed up.  With being in the diner mind set, I was thinking a portion that would make it a quick eat, was I ever wrong.  Three big pieces of meatloaf covered in gravy, without mushrooms, and a side of mashed potatoes.  The meatloaf was fall apart goodness.  Each bite was amazing and no spice used was overpowering.  What I enjoyed most was that they used whole cloves of garlic in the meatloaf.  I pitied any person I was came in contact with after this meal just because of the amount of garlic i devoured.  The side of mashed potatoes were amazing as well.  Light and fluffy with the right amount of lumps in them.

You would think that after I devoured all that, I wouldn't be able to fit any more in my belly, but I dared to go for dessert.  Why not treat myself?  I went with the cheesecake, simple yet just sweet enough for me.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar and a few dabs of whipped cream.  The cheesecake was light and melted in my mouth.  Now, when I tell you I was stuffed when I left here, I mean I was over the brim stuffed.  All I wanted to do was lay down and take a nap after this meal.

The staff were amazing and like I said this place ran like a well oiled machine.  From the front of the house to the kitchen.  Servers were well versed in all things this restaurant offered and always there when you needed them.  The kitchen staff were on point and did not mess a single thing up.  The kitchen manager was shouting out orders to keep everyone on track.  They even came out to chat with the regular customers.

A great establishment to dine at, definitely going to be coming back here."}
{"text":"I live near Robinson so I get really excited to not see a chain restaurant in our area  (Robinson is 95% chains).

I have eaten there twice, the biggest thing I have come away from the place is the portions are HUGE. Also, they have a lot of specials. :)

So far I have only had the caesar salad and the crab cake meal. The caesar salad was ok, I received the salad with the dressing on the side which I thought was kind of weird for a caesar. 

The crab cake meal was a much better experience. The french onion soup was very good. When I got the meal I got mashed potatoes as the side, which came with no gravy which was kind of odd as well. Maybe its just me thinking this is weird? haha

The atmosphere was awesome, and after reading a few more reviews I know next time to go with either breakfast or a greek dish! :)"}
{"text":"The staff was pleasant. I went with my boyfriend during lunch and it was definitely a busy time in there. I had the turkey sandwich which was delicious but some of the turkey was kind of slimy so I probably wouldn't order it again. But my boyfriend's said his ham and eggs were delicious!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at the large menu selection. When you hear \"diner\" it's easy to associate that with late night or early morning breakfast food. 

Service was very prompt, and friendly! The food was very fresh, and came in large portions. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I can't rate the food because we didn't stay. Service was awful. The waitress seated us, got our drinks and left. She came back and I had asked what the specials were. She ripped a page off here order pad and handed it to me and proceeded to walk away. Wait, what?! No prices even on the slip she gave me. I have NEVER have that happen. 
Now, I get people have bad days, we all do, but this was not the case. She was either shy, which on that case is in the wrong business, or she was poorly trained, which that is on the business. Either way, it's a shame because I've been wanting to try this place out for a while and this was the first impression I get. We did explain to the manager the issues, he kindly said we didn't need to pay for our drinks, which I would have. Maybe someday we'll give another try, but for now, it's totally on the back burner."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they first opened, and they have really come a long way. Their breakfast menu is really great and probably the strongest part of the menu. They have really great dinner specials every evening too, with huge portions. I got the lasagna one time and it was enough to feed 3 people."}
{"text":"Spent the night near PIT before an early morning flight the next day. After my hotel check-in I felt like going somewhere nearby for an evening snack. I needed to refuel my rental and found the diner near Sheetz. I was welcomed into the restaurant and sat at the bar whilst perusing the dessert menu. I decided to splurge a bit and ordered the brownie sundae. It was sweet, tasty, and chocolate delicious-ness! Lots of whipped cream, ice cream, nuts, and (DUH) chocolate goodness.
I had a great server and she made sure all was good during my visit.

Next time I'm in the area I'll come back for another dessert and a good meal...everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled delicious!"}
{"text":"Waited about 30 minutes with a child before my waitress even came to my Table. I had tables around me come and leave before I even received my food. I had to beg for bread for my son cause he was getting fussy he was waiting for so long. After I order waited about another 30 minutes before I receive my food and it was dry over seasoned and just disgusting. It was my first time there and I had high hopes because of the good reviews but promise I'll never come back ! Horrible service even worse food..."}
{"text":"Got into PIT at 11:30pm off California time, needed food.  We stumbled on this amazing diner, lots of Greek options.  Got the Greek salad and a side of sweet potato fries.  It was so big I'll probably be what I eat for lunch tomorrow as well.  Wait service was very friendly and kind for a late night diner.  We will be back to enjoy this place more."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT. The service is phenomenal. The food is great quality and it is quick and timely. The desserts looked amazing!! The place is clean and pretty ambience. I was visiting when I found it but if I came to PA again I'd come back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic service and food. The staff are all so kind, quick and helpful that it makes you want to come back every day just because you feel at home. The menu is SO large sometimes it's hard to choose from, but everything is amazing. Large portions making the leftovers enough for another meal (which is a plus!) and the prices are not bad at all. The marinara pasta sauce is out of this world along with the chicken Slovaki. Perfect every single time. My favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was great. Huge portions. Friendly staff.  Lack in the bar mixed drink area though"}
{"text":"We were up at Robinson shopping and remembered that a friend of ours recommended this place. The food is wonderful, and the staff is very friendly. As soon as you walk in there is a beautiful cake display. The food was amazing, and the portions were huge. Definitely bring a sweater though, because that place is freezing."}
{"text":"Central diner is a great restaurant and you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The service is always good and the manager always goes around to make sure tables are doing good. I've been going to this place for a long time and have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have never been disappointed. The food is really good, the portions are ample and it's reasonably priced. Large menu with breakfast anytime and a full bar. Best coffee in the area too! Kind of a hidden gen. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Food is always good and the portions are huge. Staff is friendly and decor is very nice, but it's a bit loud.  If you are looking for family dining, it's definitely a much better option then the Eat N Park or Bob Evans nearby."}
{"text":"Late Night Munchies...

The place advertises they are open late night (but not really).    When I see late night - I think of the greasy spoon that is open after the bars close (2:30 AM).    

Atmosphere:

Very nice and new.    The place was clean and did not look like a greasy spoon I was expecting.    Everything seemed pretty new (remodel).    It was a Denny's in a past life.

Food:

I ordered the Fish Sandwich and Carrot Cake.    The fish sandwich was huge and good.   The portions were large.

The carrot cake was very good.   I could see large chunks of carrots.   I wish there was less icing on the cake - very sugary.  I would have preferred a cream cheese frosting (but that is me).


Prices:

Breakfast and Sandwiches seem pretty reasonable (a little more than Bob Evans / traditional restaurant places).   Their entrees are really expensive ($12-20).

Overall - I will be back.   I want to try their breakfast.

Summary:

Atmosphere - Very nice.   Everything is new.
Service - I had a great waitress who enhanced the experience
Food - The food was good but not anything to set it apart from other places in the area
Price - on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Great variety of food fatty or healthy.   Walked in two hours before closing and already out of my favorite soup and also dessert and that's why I give it a 4 instead of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went to dinner there last night and it was outstanding. We had chicken Alfredo and it was the best I've ever had. It was suggested by our hotel and we are glad to went. The desserts looked great but we were so full we didn't have any. Definitely worth a stop if in the area"}
{"text":"We have eaten here two mornings in a row. The food is delicious, gets to your table quick and the service is excellent.  Today Seth was on top of everything and Mary Beth is a fun hostess. Got sat very quickly.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch a few weeks ago.  I've had many reuben sandwiches in my life, but the one here was the BEST I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"The best restaurant around!! Me and my family go all the time and it happens to be our favorite. HUGE portions and affordable. Great service almost all of the time."}
{"text":"Great family resturaunt with great food.  My family and I love to go here for Sunday brunch.  I always get the gyro or ruben with sweet potato fries and it is always outstanding.  Huge portions for a fair price too. It's enough for half the meal to take home.   Owner is very friendly and acomodating.  Even when it's busy, we get seated quickly and served quickly. Definetely a recommendation."}
{"text":"Central diner and grill has excellent service!!  I would give the service 5 stars for sure!  Two different managers came by to check on us and our waitress was super attentive!  The menu is big.  Salads, sandwiches, burgers and they serve breakfast all day!  I got an omelette for lunch.  It was great.  Definitely a lot of food!  
They have their own parking lot, but it is hard to get into bc you have to do a u turn. 
The restaurant does get a lot if traffic for lunch and it does get loud.  But, as soon as the lunch crowd files out it is a normal volume."}
{"text":"I love this place! We don't go often (mainly because we never think of it!), but when we do, we leave completely satisfied!  Tonight was no different. The menu is really large and takes some time to read through, but they offer so many delicious meals. The pricing is fair, especially with how much food you get! I know I've eaten at many other places and have paid much more for less. Our server tonight (Seth) was spot on. He seemed to have the largest section (the counter, the booths along the window, & the patio) and he was wonderful! I had to bring half of my dinner home....and got a piece of Buckeye cake to go. (Their cakes are made by Signature desserts & I love them!) We will return.....hopefully sooner rather than later!!"}
{"text":"Service was really quick, food was good, and the atmosphere was fantastic.  They also have a nice area to sit outside.  Would recommend.  And the prices were fair"}
{"text":"Love the place, this was my second time! The server was great, go and sit in Seth's area, super helpful. Food is great & the portions are huge. Love the fact they serve Pepsi products!!!!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a dance competition and the lady at our hotel suggested this place. Great call. Service was good and fast and the food was delicious. Tried the pork soulvaki and wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"Worthy of another 5 star review and update. I've been by a few more times and its still great in my eyes.  

I've brought my friend here one time. She ordered a sirloin which was huge and I ordered a chicken wrap ( also huge)

Today I brought my sister who also hadn't been here. She ordered the wrap, I ordered the Cobb Salad- grilled chicken, bacon, tomatoes, hard boiled egg, swiss cheese on a bed of chopped lettuce (delicious, fresh & huge salad) my niece ordered the kids spaghetti. She enjoyed it. Kids meals also cone with pudding, jello or ice cream as a treat. 

They seem to have a few bottled beers now (Stella!!!) And some wine. There is patio seating as well as a counter...not to mention booths and tables

 Everyday there is large list of specials. Today's for example were lasagna, stuffed pepper, Shepard's pie ect. I saw someone's lasagna plate.... Enormous!!!! 

 Central Diner is awesome. If you've never been, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Alright. . . ticking off the list:

1)  Nice atmosphere
2)  Good service
3)  meh food

It's new, and pretty, and while it's a \"diner\", it's a diner that was built in the last three months, so the decor is pretty sweet, everything is all clean and gleaming brushed stainless and muted colors.  No patina of cigarette smoke and coffee stains, like the tried and true diners of old.  Which is a good thing.

The service was good, I don't recall her being particularly knowledgeable, but how knowledgeable could she have been since we ate there two weeks after they opened?  I also don't remember her being NOT knowledgeable.  So. . . YAY!

Now for the bad. . . 

I ordered a reuben.  My friend remarked that it's hard to find a place that has a good reuben.  I didn't necessarily agree, but said nothing.  We both got it.  We were both surprised to see it served open face, which, upon asking the manager (we'll come back to him in a minute) was because, \"It's the chef's interpretation of a reuben.  He wanted to make it unique.\"  

It WAS unique.  But unique in a way that sucked.  Like if the chef interpreted a hot dog by saying, \"HERE we serve our hot dogs with the mustard in your hand instead of on the dog. \"  It was a stupid interpretation.  Messy.  And not good.  Because the sauerkraut was kind of slippery, and the cheese was kind of melty, and the dressing was very heavy handed, so when you used your knife to cut it you ended up with half the sandwich still on the plate because it wouldn't stick on the fork, so you had a bite of cheese and dressing, then went back for a bite of bread and saurkraut and meat.  It was sloppy and I ended up scooping most of the dressing onto the side of the plate so it was tolerable.  And on the plus side there was a lot of food. . . but the negative of that was it was really hard to cut without food dropping off the side of the plate while you sawed at the sandwich through the meat.  

So then the manager came to our table, which I generally liked, but he was so aggressively wanting to nip any issues in the bud that he came across a little. . . militantly servile.  \"Did everything exceed your expectations?\" he asked.  Then when our grunts of polite assent didn't suffice, he addressed each of us individually. . . it was uncomfortable.  I just wanted to be left to eat my shitty sandwich in peace.  I felt uncomfortable complaining about my shitty sandwich, because it was, of course, ON PURPOSE.  Did it exceed my expectations?  No!  But I didn't really want to interrupt my meal to have a discussion about it.  I bought his departure by saying that I didn't really have any expectations coming in, so I couldn't really judge whether they'd been exceeded.  Which was a lie.

When we paid our bill. . . the manager was at the cash register. . . eagerly waiting to ask, once more, \"Did your experience exceed your expectations?\"  UGGGGHHHH!  I just wanted to leave.  \"I don't know, yes. . . yes, it was fine!\"  

Ultimately, I will return.  It was really close to work, and it's my own fault for not reading that they serve the reuben open faced.  I assume it's on the menu that way.  And next time I'll just tell the manager to go away because he's bothering me, which is more my speed. . . I was just caught a little off guard.

If my next experience is. . . better (which will exceed my expectations) I'll update my review and add a star or two to it.  Until then though. . . it was \"meh\".  Diner food."}
{"text":"Huge diner menu. Good place for a group who can't decide what to eat.  I've been here once but feel like there are too many other restaurants to make this a favorite. However I do know some people who swear by this place.

Place was extremely busy around Noon on Sunday. There was about a ten minute wait. Seating is available inside, outside and at a small counter. The fries are crispy. The paninis were soggy. The cakes are huge and only cost $6 a slice."}
{"text":"Outstanding....always. Have been coming here for a while and always pleased.  Had one trip for lunch one day when I ordered soup and the appetizer sampler.  It was HUGH, however it was not to my liking, I didn't care for the coating on the items.  I picked at it, there was NOTHING wrong with it, just not my taste.  The waitress asked if I wanted a box and I explained I didn't care for it.  To my surprise when I got my check for my soup and drink they had taken it off.  I hunted down the younger manager and told him there was nothing wrong with it, just I didn't care for it, it wasn't their fault.  I said I would pay and he insisted NO.... if I didn't like it/eat it he wasn't going to charge for it.  I actually argued with him about it and he insisted!  OUTSTANDING service.  Its a regular for me and a few friends when we hang out.  I would recommend this place to everyone.  Huge portions, great food, outstanding service!!"}
{"text":"I grew up about an hour east of Pittsburgh, so anytime I get to come home, getting a taste of home is always a treat for me.  Dayton, unfortunately, does not have many diners.  Naturally, I grew up hitting the various breakfast spots with my grandparents all across Western PA.  So, while out for my sister's wedding, Jules and I hit the Central Diner & Grille (CDG, from here on out), which shared a parking lot with our hotel.   

When I first saw CDG, I expected a stereotypical greasy-spoon as from my youth.  Instead, we were treated to a clean, upscale experience with a drool-inducing bakery case out front, filled with all sorts of amazing confections.  While I was expecting a wait (especially on a weekend at the start of brunch/lunch rush), we were seated almost immediately.

The first thing that struck me about the food, though, were the portions.  The server eyed me a little skeptically when I ordered the French Toast with eggs, bacon and a side of hash browns, but I didn't think much of it.  Pretty standard breakfast, right?  Sweet zombie Jesus, I was wrong!  My hash browns came on a dinner platter of their own and must have comprised 2-3 whole potatoes on their own.

What's better?  The food was fantastic.  My French Toast came covered in delicious, fresh berries--most places, I'd expect some type of macerated fruit compote from a can, but these berries tasted of freshness and sweetness, with no unnecessary gel.  My hash browns were a perfect balance of soft and crispy, sauteed with diced onion and garlic.     

Better yet?  The price!  Jules and I walked out of there--with tip--for less than $25.  We were stuffed for the duration of the long day, as we didn't eat again until the reception nearly 10 hours later.  Can't beat that with a stick!

If you're in the area, go here.  If you're not, make a road trip.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Central is the go to spot for majestic food and to get a full belly. No other restaurant compares to the epic portions of central provided; so big they'll make Texas blush. The lavish Spanish omelette provides an authentic ethnic born of peppers and onions, coated with a light but flavor packed chorizo sauce. Paired with a side of home style home fries created the perfect blend of culture with comfort. Next is the French toast deluxe. Deluxe doesn't quite explain the soft and buttery showcase that invades every taste bud. The sizes of these pillows of bread may seem intimidating at first, but you'll soon find its a struggle to put your fork down.the accompanying sides of ham, bacon, and sausage tops this meal off with class."}
{"text":"Decent food & service. A little pricey for a \"diner\" but because it's in Robinson it catches a huge crowd."}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent people with better tasting food! The menu is so large and it is hard to choose from. They literally have everything and I never once had a bad dish there. Very generous portions, would recommend if ever in the area."}
{"text":"Loud but good. Have been wanting to try this place for awhile now, but didn't want to wait. Estimated time was spot on & the only breakfast spot in the area I know of selling bloody marys or mimosas. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here! So happy to have somewhere in Robinson other than a chain to go to! Favorite parts of the meal: crab stuffed mushrooms, grape leaves.. also.. pickle juice martini was amazing. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten breakfast here and it was always good. Tonight I had dinner and loved it! I had one of their special chicken dishes and it was fantastic! I'm definitely going to come back for dinner again. Portions are large and the service was very good."}
{"text":"Did not know where to go for breakfast and decided to come to Central. The food is really good my daughter got a buffalo chicken salad and my husband and I got breakfast. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I kept hearing good things about this dining spot and looked forward to experiencing it .  It is a glorified diner featuring a full menu of home made tasting dishes, soups, sandwiches and desserts.
  
The selections are fantastic and the portions are huge.  They have daily features which include comfort foods to the max!  Stuffed peppers, meatloaf, beef tips and rice are just a few of the offerings.
Breakfast is served all day and the menu looked amazing.
I was very pleased with their homemade goodness and plan to visit again soon.
They also offer wine and spirits.

{"text":"My friend and I came here to get a nice breakfast in the afternoon. We tried the Greek Benedict and the Nova Scotia Benedict, which were sizably portioned and delicious. The price was right for the amount of food, and the service was great

My friend did find a piece of eggshell in his meal. However, the waitress and the manager handled it very professionally, and offered to redo the meal as well as offered a free dessert. Overall it was a great meal and a great experience."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever eaten anything from here that I didn't love. 

Great French onion soup, fantastic burgers, Greek dishes that are second to none and a refrigerator full of pies and cakes that might require two rulers to measure.

Kudos to the kitchen staff they dish up some fantastic dishes and the management keeps this restaurant turning at a fast pace!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim, and immediately the atmosphere was friendly, the cooks and runners were vocal and it was fun to watch. The place was packed and it still only took 10 minutes for a table. I ordered the Chicken Athena and it was delicious and on point. The coffee is great as well, goes great with the yummy desserts. Do yourself a favor and save room! Also kudos to the wait staff, our waitress was super nice. The other diners were also very friendly when they heard it was our first time. It won't be our last."}
{"text":"We went here two years ago when it first opened.   It's basically like an upscale eat n park.


Portion sizes are decent but so far the food is pretty average.

If you like traditional marinara sauce on your Italian dishes you will be disappointed.    Whatever this was it had so much onion and peppers in it I sent it back.

I also take issue with the staff and food handling.   We were able to see into the kitchen from our table where a cook repeatedly touched his face and nose while handling food.

A waitress fixing her hair just before scooping ice cream.

All in all I really don't see what the hype is over this place."}
{"text":"This diner gave me a bad taste. It started with dirty forks and dirty plates. The experience continued to get worse when my panini ordered with very light cheese came out more than half cheese. I had to dissect my food to eat it.  Service was friendly but forgot sets of silverware, gave the wrong plates to the wrong guests and generally didn't know service. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This little diner was perfect. The menu selection was so refreshing!  Having been in Pittsburgh for a week we were tired of pizza and sandwich type meals. The portions were bigger than any I've seen and coming from Texan that says a lot! The staff and owners were welcoming and friendly.  Too bad we found this place on our last night here."}
{"text":"Darren and I came here yesterday and had an amazing brunch. The food leans Greek and Italian with lots of diner favorites on their big menu. I had a reuben burger and loved it along with their battered fries. The have a bunch of awesome pies and cakes on display. The german chocolate was excellent. Great service. The servers all help each other which is nice to see. Our server, Tula (such a cute name), was a sweetheart. The decor is great too. They're also open late. Go!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my meal at Central Diner & Grille! The restaurant was pretty big with plenty of seating and plenty of parking. There was a nice outside dining space as well that looked like a nice place to eat when the weather is warm. 
I was actually overwhelmed by the menu! When I think diner, I usually don't think of a 6 page spread, but this place had it all! breakfast, wraps, salads, hot and cold sandwiches, and dessert! Not to mention all the pasta, steaks, and seafood they offer after 5pm for dinner. 
The quality of the food gets an A+ for sure! Everything was homemade, fresh- not frozen, and giant portions. The sweet potato fries were to die for! And the cakes on display were literally the size of pumpkins! 
If you want to break away from all the chain restaurants in Robinson, check out Central Diner!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once, but this seems like typical diner fare that's playing dress up. Big portions and no frills items are the standard here, and the food and menu would be more at home in an establishment with a counter rather than one with a foyer and a chalkboard advertising $17 dinners. To be honest I'd give this place a 3.5 if possible, because there's nothing actually wrong with the restaurant, or the food, or the service....I'm just not in any hurry to go back. 

If you like a lot of food this is the place to go. The French onion soup was the true highlight of the meal, and I could've gotten away with just eating that. I really love French onion, and the broth was 7/10 with the cheese 5/10, but it's extremely difficult to find good French onion and almost impossible to find the authentic kind, so for me this is a decent rating. If I go back I will 100% get this again, and perhaps try a piece of cake. 

I ordered the turkey club wrap. I was pleasantly surprised to find this included REAL turkey, not the lunch meat variety. The wrap was big enough that I took half home and it made a decent meal the next day. The wrap did not include cheese or mayo like a typical club, and as such it was rather bland. The fries were frozen fries that come in a bag, so I was disappointed in that. 

Boyfriend got the Greek omelette, which was quite tasty, and came with homefries and toast. I guess if you really like diners than you will like the food here. I was hoping for a bit more, (flavor-wise, not quantity) and rather shocked at some of the prices ($5.95 for two eggs??? Really??). Not a bad meal by any means, but not memorable either."}
{"text":"Food is great, and in large portions. I've been 3 times, and it was excellent every time. Staff is also great. Energetic, courteous, and they stay out of your way and let you eat. Seth was great last time I was there.

The entire place is clean and well kept, which is an added bonus."}
{"text":"So so good! The stuffed shrimp with crabmeat is to die for, the chili is perfect and the carrot cake is heaven (get a scoop of ice cream with it!) Plus the staff is always so friendly and efficient.  Definitely one of our go to places!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, the menu and portions are HUGE, and the service has been outstanding at every visit. Great place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow! What a find. I almost drove on by because it's difficult turning left into the parking lot. I'm so glad I stopped. The menu is huge and there are plenty of specials to choose from. I has the stuffed cabbage with mashed potatoes and the Greek lemon chicken soup. There was plenty of lemon but wasn't much chicken. Then they brought out the biggest stuffed cabbage I had ever seen. It was cooked to perfection and so delicious. I probably should have taken half of it home but it was so good I ate the whole thing. I'll definitely pay for that later, lol."}
{"text":"Woah quite surprised with this mega diner! 

Coolest thing was the inside- it was extremely cold I remember, but other Than that looked mad modern- probably the nicest diner I've been to! 

Menu was extremely diverse, they seemed to have a Mediterranean influence in the menu, which was good because I love em Mediterranean spices! 

I got the Mediterranean chicken, man was it plentiful! Lots of chicken- I thought it may have been a little well done- but nonetheless the dish was pretty magnificent and grand- came with a side of steamed broccoli to be healthy. 

I wanted some cake, which they had a TON of but cut myself off at this point because I wasn't sure if I can walk. 

Service was pretty good, little pricey but you get your money's worth.

Will return."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning and expected to have a wait but got seated within 10 minutes - the place is quite big so I think that helps.  

Ordered the challah french toast and it was seriously larger than my head.  I'm not sure what mutant stove/pan made this monster toast but it could have fed a village.  It was exactly what french toast should be, a bit crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  I think the only think that could have made this dish better was berries (fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberries).  I got bacon with it and it's like they slaughtered a whole pig if you saw how much bacon it came with.

Essentially I'm saying the portions are huge, food tastes great, service was excellent and you should go!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the very first time and I'll honestly say that it's the best place in western PA. Mary Beth and Hailey are two beautiful spunky women that made me feel like I've known them for years! Food is great and the bread is top notch. LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"The best place to eat within miles! I can eat here for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I've eaten here a BUNCH of times and it is my go to breakfast place.  Better than anything around within miles.  They have a lot of seating, which is good for breakfast time on the weekends because they can get pretty packed. I consider it a better tasting IHOP/Denny's/Eat N Park with a Greek/Mediterranean twist.

Their servings are kind of crazy big!  My husband and I can share a lot of the things on the menu.  Make sure you take a look at the specials that are on the chalkboard in the front of the restaurant or ask your server about them.  I've been continually impressed with the specials over the past couple of months.

Food: Just be prepared for the large portions.  When I order their gyro salad I typically ask them to box up half before it even gets to me because I already know it's going to be too much lol!  And I'm extreme... I don't think I like the lettuce on the gyro salad so I ask to substitute spinach instead and put the dressing on the side so that I can take home whatever I don't eat.  I'm not sure where they buy their vegetables, but their tomatoes are so juicy and delicious every time (mmmmmm)!  For breakfast/brunch sometimes I order the omelette but it's a lot of egg (almost too much for me).  I also like the grilled cheese, but it's almost too much sandwich (getting the picture here?). I do like that they added wine/beer (maybe liquor? I don't remember because I always get a bottle of beer or a mimosa).  

Dessert: get a cake slice.  You likely will be full from your meal, so worst case order one to go.  My favorite is the white cake with the birthday sprinkles on there.  One time they forgot about my meal and the manager got me a free slice of cake to go (a man after my own heart)!  

Since I live in the area it's one of the only continual staples I go to all the time.  I don't know what I'd do without them!  I order things for pickup all of the time as well."}
{"text":"This place is anything but traditional! It appears they have a bit of everything you can think of...and then some! I had the spanakopita appetizer as my entree and it was very good. They served it cold with a lovely garnish of fresh tomato, cucumber, feta, and kalamata. My husband had a turkey club with cole slaw and potato salad - all home made and delicious. The portions are humongous and can easily serve two people, maybe three if you order the pasta. The only thing keeping me from giving Central five stars was the overwhelming noise. Big open room + high hard ceilings = too much noise to even hear the people at your own table."}
{"text":"Went here for a business lunch. The atmosphere is nice and everything LOOKS good. But the food falls short of the expectation set by the venue and menue prices. 

I ordered a prime rib sandwich, it was extremely bland. The fries it came with are the same mid range pre-frozen you can get at any small local diner.

When I go out it's to eat good food I can't make myself at home. This place fails that test. I'd go back, but only if someone else was paying."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go to places to eat. Adorable family owned diner with huge portions and incredibly reasonable prices. The staff is so nice and always stop and chat if you're a regular. Food is delicious, especially the Greek food and the Greek salad is unbelievable. And I don't even like salad! I highly recommend Central for something delicious, easy, quick and good prices!"}
{"text":"We usually come here for dinner but decided to give it a shot for breakfast. I got my usual eggs poached hard (came out perfect), fruit instead of hash browns and rye toast. My husband got the garden omelette w ham added- he said it was missing cheese because it did lack some flavor. Next time he would add cheese. 
Service was good and they were very busy. I'd add it into our breakfast spot rotation but my husband said he prefers their dinner (chef salad)."}
{"text":"Truly this restaraunt doesn't disappoint. There is always some deliciousness to be found...from breakfast thru lunch and dinner.  Their portions are HUGE. Their staff is extremely efficient and accommodating. Tried the lasagna the other nite...YUM! A different sauce from the traditional Italian that is light and tasty and the noodles weren't soggy.  It served me 3 meals!!  This is one of our go to places, many different tastes to be had."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and outstanding food! Love this place. A New Jersey diner in Robinson. Never a bad experience. Portions are huge and everything is made from scratch. French onion soup is out of this world!!! Owners are aways present to greet customers and check on things at your table. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Nice upscale diner. Spacious and beautifully decorated. Good place for a business breakfast. Bacon was top notch. Mediterranean omelet good but nothing special. Hashbrowns -- meh. . Had a slightly off taste. Coffee decent, and they will refill your cup until you say stop. Large portions and a good value overall. Not sure the food quite lives up to the expectations one has when seeing how nicely designed the restaurant is, but certainly a notch above the various budget breakfast chains."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great drinks and food.  Breakfast for dinner with a great wine.  The soup is really yummy-even took some home.  Will always return here!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and it was really good. Tonight it's busy, my husband put our name on the list and a few minutes later I went to the hostess to tell her that my father needed a table and not a booth. She then proceeded to yell at me that \"i can't let you look at the list!!!\". Lost her mind unnecessarily. We're waiting for a table and already this experience has left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic diner style food in Pittsburgh this is the place. Having grown up in the New York City metropolitan area this rivals the classic diner's of that particular area. Very generous portions, and extensive menu selection, and wonderful service in addition to the high quality of food make this an excellent choice if your hungry. And let's talk about dessert? You will not be disappointed. Better grab two forks because one slice of cake and feed a small army. I highly recommend Central Diner"}
{"text":"Central Diner was an awful experience. My lamb was over cooked and the \"roasted\" potatoes were actually baked potatoes that tasted like they had been soaked in citric acid overnight. We asked the waitress about the sour taste and she replied that she had no idea and didn't intend on asking for us. My sister's steak was mediocre, slightly burnt and her waffle fries were Costco frozen quality. Our salmon wasn't seasoned at all, not even salt. On the contrary, my French onion soup was so salty I couldn't eat it. After seeing that I didn't eat my French onion soup, our waitress (I don't know her name because she didn't take the time to inform us) snarkily let us know that her daughter had expensive taste just like me, but unlike me, her daughter actually ate the food she paid for..... It's not my fault their soup is saltier than the Dead Sea. The portions are large here, so if you do come here, consider sharing a meal. Last negative thing.... Three entrees and a $2 upcharge for french onion soup equaled $70.... We didn't even have drinks or desserts... Incredibly overpriced, bland/ as salty as Vegimite, and rude waitress. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic service! It was a very busy Saturday night and they were on point! Waitress and manager checked on us many times and the food was amazing. No complaints!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner on April 2nd. The steak and Buffalo Chicken Salad was great. It was enough for two meals. We loved the Carrot Cake we took home for dessert."}
{"text":"Great food. Did not expect it to be as nice inside as it was. HUGE portions. Good service."}
{"text":"We came in because of the reviews. Disappointed. My corned beef hash omelet was browned and dry. Wife's cream cheese and chives inlets was tasteless. 
Home fries were barely warmed just like to cold plate of bacon. Must have been yesterday's. Coffee was bitter. 
Our waitress was sweet and the place is pretty good looking.
Bring a parka."}
{"text":"I travel to Pittsburgh for business, and I stop at Central Diner every time. Generous Portions of great food. Very friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here.  We started with fried pickles.  We got a massive plate full of bland pickles fried in batter that was not really attached to the skinny, dried out pickles.  The chunky yet watery marinara that came with them was not good for dipping, and was equally bland.  We ate a few, but there were many left over.  For$9 this was disappointing.  My wife got a grilled cheese sandwich, which should be a staple of a good diner,  and mashed potatoes ($3extra).  I got the Spanikopita... A \"Greek special\".  The food was, again bland.  The grilled cheese was not good, and the Spanikopita was worse.  The phylo dough was dense, and chewy. The filling was dry and tasteless.  The side salad that came with it had been sitting around for a while.  Beer selection was very limited.  Total bill was $41, which was over priced for the quality.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"Formally Denny's, this place has definitely gotten an upgrade to what I would call upscale casual.  I requested and was given a booth.  Décor is nice.  I thought it was too cold to be comfortable, and I notice one other reviewer mentioned this as well.  My server {I'm afraid I don't remember his name} gave quite good service, although he was wearing an INCREDIBLY dirty apron.  I was in the mood for a great burger, so I ordered the Jack Burger.  AWESOME!!  It arrived in timely fashion, with the cole slaw {Maybe the best I've ever had!} delivered first.  Fries were very good, and the burger...ah, the burger...was wonderful!  A tasty bun, very good meat, LOTS of grilled onions which is a big hooray for me, pepper jack cheese, and what I believe was a chipotle sauce.  Yummy!!  Now, the onions were very slippery, and I realized that if I even considered picking the burger up, I would have a completely onion-covered outfit.  So I ingeniously cut half of it up and proceeded to enjoy it greatly.  As the burger was quite large, I took it and half the cole slaw home.  The only downside of the dining experience for me was that, in a nearly empty restaurant {it was only about 4:15}, a family with {well-behaved yet loud and a bit whiney} children was seated directly behind me.  Thus the 4 star rather than a 5.  Other than that, however the place was 5 star all the way!"}
{"text":"I just had my first experience at the Central Diner, and I was very impressed. Beautiful decor, great staff, huge portions- a great addition to Robinson.
Since I'm Greek, I've had a lot of Greek food. At most restaurants, Greek food means throwing feta cheese and olives on a tossed salad. I can say with some some authority that the Greek food here is excellent. The Village Salad is perfect and sloppy, so make sure you get some bread to soak it up. I was impressed with their Avgolemono soup (egg-lemon soup with chicken stock), which had a unique creaminess that made it a step above. We also had spanakopita, which was crunchy and had a fresh spinach taste, and the calamari, which had a nice seasoned breading and perfectly fried,
As for the portions, they are leftover sized. The steak was over 20oz, the breaded chicken was two huge boneless breasts (where do you get chicken that big?), and the fillet of sole was two big cuts of fish. I think we took more food home then we ate there!
While I haven't tried it yet, I understand the breakfast is also amazing, so I'll be coming back for sure to try that.
As for the prices, they are slightly higher then you'd expect at a diner, but the portions and quality are above the price, and the term \"diner\" is loosely used here. 
I can't wait to go back- Opa!"}
{"text":"I don't know how Central Diner received such a high rating on Yelp. The service is nice but the food is bland at best and blagh at worst. I had the chili, which was bitter. The stuffed mushrooms were stuffed with so much bread that I couldn't taste the crab. The filet of sole didn't taste like anything, regardless of what I was promised. I'm not sure if I caught the kitchen on a bad day but everything was blah. Thankfully, it's tough to mess up a baked potato, so at least I ate something. The manager tried to fix things but I was so disappointed with everything I was served, I didn't want anything else. So go if you want good service, but don't go if you want good food."}
{"text":"The impression that I got upon entering and looking at the menu is that this a \"New York City/New Jersey\" diner. I did ask and the owner was from that area before establishing this diner. The food is made from scratch, real mashed potatoes, homemade bread dressing for the sliced turkey, homemade tzatziki sauce, etc. The menu is extensive. The portions area very large. I had a turkey dinner and it was very good. My wife had a Greek omelet and she said that it was very good. Another person at our table had French toast and the bread was thick slices of challah. We did not have room for dessert but, like a New York/New Jersey diner, there is a rotating cooler by the cashiers station full of over-sized cakes. My wife and I will return."}
{"text":"The space is beautiful, that's for sure. They did a great job on the reno. It's fancy inside but without being stuffy. Seemed to be a lot of business folks from the nearby office parks inside. 

I had french toast which was fluffy and flavorful. Bacon was crisp and tasty. Prices were reasonable. Complaint? A place this fancy-looking inside should not give me a handful of individual packets of Smucker's syrup. Come on guys, let's get some warm syrup in a carafe, please! Our waitress was friendly and helpful, although she did not match the atmosphere, so to speak...seemed like maybe she had worked at the Denny's that was there before.

It seems they do not have a website, which I also find incredibly odd. 2013 people!

Hope to try it for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday morning before heading to IKEA. It was crowded but we got a table right away. The server was friendly and quick with our drinks and in taking our order. I had the Big Fat Greek Omelette, which was awesome. I was surprised by how nice it was inside for being a diner. My only issue was that it was really loud. The staff worked very hard to keep things moving. Our food took awhile to come out but it was well worth the wait. I would go back and tells others to eat here."}
{"text":"I don't believe a place that doesn't bake their own cakes deserves 5 stars but this place is the exception to the rule. 
Everything looks delicious and the portions are Huge!!!!! 
We had the pork souvlaki and lamb chops. 
Excellent and what a bargain. 
The bread basket was hot and toasty. 
The service is impeccable for a diner and the owner was very hands on with customers. 
This is a beautiful diner with dark woods and polished nickel accents. The bathrooms are gorgeous. 
The chocolate martini ordered was one of the best I've ever had. 
Can't say more about this place. 
You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Heading out to the airport we knew that we did not have  to eat before we left. Not wanting to stop at one of the many chain restaurants in the Robinson area we decided to try this place for the first time. Calling it's a diner is a little misleading, it feels like a upscale sitdown restaurant that happens to have booths and a counter. 

The menu is divided from classic American to Mediterranean Greek food. I chose to have the Gyro platter, which was a Gyro sandwich broke up into a salad served with as much great Greek dressing as I could ever want. 
Everyone at the table decided to have something different so we had orders of fries, burgers and Panini's. To be honest there was not much talk about the food because everybody was too busy eating. The portion sizes are humongous and everyone had food to take home. I truly believe that this is one of the best deals as far as portion sizes in the city. All in all great service, taste and portion sizes. 
My only problem with the restaurant was that it was loud. We have a unique situation with having an autistic son who is overwhelmed by too much noise. We did Ask be moved in they placed us in a quieter corner. It really helped and our son was able to relax and eat his meal. I cannot say thank you enough for doing that for us. 
We will be back in this possibly could be our restaurant of choice in Robinson all the time."}
{"text":"I was out shopping for my Sons 11th Birthday and on the way home we stopped here ... Big mistake .... The Calamari tasted liked rubber bands and our server was far from attentive although she was nice, I will never step foot in here again and the Guido manager had an attitude ... This place is trash although it's set up nice"}
{"text":"Diner cuisine, not exactly chef inspired, was pretty tasty. Outdoor seating in season, full bar."}
{"text":"This place is far from our house but a friend of the family gave us a gift card for our anniversary about a year ago,finally we decided to drive 6 miles to try it. It was lunch time Sunday and the place was packed,we kind of expected it but we didn't wait that long. I ordered meatloaf with the sides of mashed potato with gravy. Man,the serving was huge like good for 2 people,i ended up eating meatloaf for the next 2 days lol. It was good too,we had some calamari for starters and it was good. Our server was very engaging with our 5 year old which was nice. They gave us ice cream topped with whipped cream for dessert as a complimentary im not sure why. Indeed a nice first time experience!"}
{"text":"This has become one of my \"go-to\" restaurants in Pittsburgh for feel good make you so happy type of eating.  The Greek salad with gyro meat is off the charts.  One of the best ever when paired up with the house dressing.  The meat is cooked to perfection and the salad portion is easily enough for two settings.  The selection of cake and baklava is also perfection at it's finest.  I've ordered the gyro sandwich and gyro plate - also worth noting are exceptionally good!

I am always pleased with the level of service at Central Diner - people seem to genuinely enjoy working at the restaurant which translates to a great experience for the customer."}
{"text":"The place is laid back, the service is excellent, and the food is good for a decent price. I had the lamb chops and they were excellent."}
{"text":"Service is awesome! The food is fresh and delicious. Couldn't ask for more. I also got the homemade rice pudding which tastes indulgent and creamy. I will definitely be back next time I'm in the area. Yum!"}
{"text":"Love this place! NY Style diner. Spanish omelette was delicious and their salads & wraps are fantastic. Great soups too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Holy... this restaurant is incredible. The portions are out of this world and the service is unparalleled (as long as they aren't totally packed). The breakfast is absolutely incredible. Try the challah French toast. It'll blow your mind. My favorite dinner entree is the stuffed shells (usually a special) but my friends often get the roast beef au jus and rave about it. Great, efficient family-owner place. Oh and they have enormous slices of cake!"}
{"text":"I ordered CHICKEN NAPOLITANO. The sauce was unique and I liked it."}
{"text":"From the greeting the door to the great service and everything in between this place is GREAT! Food was excellent (eggs Benedict). Food came out quickly and was perfect. Found this place a year ago while here for business, it's the only place I will have breakfast when I'm in the area.

3 days in the area...3 for 3 unbelievable breakfasts! Seriously, this diner is almost perfect in every regards. Service and food are second to none. Wish I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Comfort Mediterranean-American food. 

On the way to the airport (only 15 min away!), I stopped for lunch with my mom and had a very pleasant meal. 

The restaurant staff is friendly and attentive, the portion sizes are large, the prices are affordable, and the menu varied and extensive. There is very little to nitpick about  Central Diner & Grille. 

The New York Strip steak I had has satisfying. It was definitely enough to fill you up. It was a bit thicker than usual and perhaps just a tad under a perfect medium rare, but good nonetheless. My mom had a very delicious ground beef stuffed pepper, which she claimed was one of the best she had ever eaten. The French onion soup I also had was just OK. The food had a homemade quality and taste. 

Instead of going to a chain, do yourself a favor and come here instead!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the classic New York diner from back home. A huge menu with any food you can imagine. Breakfast for dinner? Italian? American bar/grill? Greek? They have it all. I had the \"Big Fat Greek Omelete\" and I thought it was absolutely terrific. Good service, nice, comfortable decor- this would be my go to place in Pitt. Good find!"}
{"text":"The service and food were awesome! This is a great place for breakfast or brunch, I just wish they used the no wait app as that is quickly becoming my favorite app, especially for places where I know i will have to wait. 
I had the Belgian waffle and Chris had the Nova Scotia eggs Benedict (smoked salmon). He really enjoyed the Benny and the waffle was great as well. Once we got a seat the service was fast and very friendly and our food arrived quickly. 
I noticed that everyone here really works their butts off. They are all constantly cleaning, clearing tables, and moving very quickly. I was impressed. They also seem to work really well together as a team. All in all very impressed! We would return for sure. 
A quick note though, this is not the place to visit if you're hungover and sound sensitive lol. It is LOUD so keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for much more based on the reviews. 
On the plus side the place is clean, I was seated very quickly and had my coffee and water given to me quickly. 
But my breakfast -which was two eggs Canadian bacon and toast- came cold. 
I sent it back -waitress brought it back microwaved-but then I never saw the waitress again ...even for refills. 
All in all the experience was poor. 
The waitress had a bad attitude I think because I sent my breakfast back.
By the way it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Restrooms are very dirty and not maintained-broken toilet and toilet paper holder."}
{"text":"They're open early for breakfast, and have a variety of traditional and elevated American breakfast items.  The restaurant is clean, open and airy. The cakes in the glass cases look delish. My Florentine Eggs Benedict was very tasty. Reasonable prices, too."}
{"text":"On our way home from Pittsburgh we were looking for somewhere to have a late breakfast. Thankfully, this place showed up on Google Maps before a Cracker Barrel.  I was expecting a small diner, but this place is a large, very beautifully decorated restaurant.   My husband and I shared the Spanish omelet and Greek eggs Benedict.  Both were amazing!  The Greek Benedict came with a homemade tzatziki sauce for the home fries, but I could have just eaten it with a spoon.  The menu is huge, as are the portions.  We left very happy and stuffed, and will definitely keep this place in mind when back in the area again."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but there were some issues.  

GREAT:

* Atmosphere.  This place is clean, and looks like a NJ diner ++ Even the menu is the same, with Greek specialties abounding.

* Dinner Portions are HUGE.  My Mom got Moussaka.  Besides being incredibly tasty, there was so much that it was almost falling off the plate.

*  Full bar.  Thank god.

GOOD:

* The service.  Not great, but not bad.  We did feel at the end that our waitress was rushing us - but, in her favor, it was the end of the night.

IMPROVEMENT:

* Dessert.  They had no non-chocolate cake options.  They had 5 half-eaten chocolate cakes in the display. The manager did tell us that he had 8 cakes coming in the next day, but it may be a sign to stock more vanilla cake options if you're completely out of them and still have all of your chocolate cakes left in the fridge.  This is so much like a NJ/NYC/Philly diner that I'm judging based upon what I'm used to - and the bakery just didn't measure up.    

* Pepsi not Coke.  For the love of god, you have to serve Coca-Cola products in a diner.  Or, at least have it as a bottled option.  Pepsi is not the same.  I will never order a Pepsi-float.

* General descriptions.  I ordered the \"Cuban Panini\".  It wasn't what I was expecting.  When making a Cuban, the bread is brushed with butter or olive oil and then grilled.   The bread on this sandwich was more toasted than grilled and there was no olive oil or butter.  The end result was fluffier and less melt-in-your-mouth than I'd expect of a Cuban sandwich.  The kitchen was also pretty heavy handed on the mustard.

SUMMARY - I will definitely be back.  Maybe it was just an off night.  Overall, I got a great vibe from this place.  The food just didn't meet my expectations this time."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Central after traveling to Pittsburgh for a weekend trip, and we enjoyed a very good Sunday breakfast there.  I would definitely recommend this over standard chain restaurant fare. Their french toast with challah bread was better than any I have had in recent years. The bread was rather large yet light with the right amount of egg and cinnamon. Also, their home fries were good but the portion size for a side order is ginormous--you are better off sharing it. The service was good and I'm looking forward to going there again the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Another can't miss for me. Always consistent, big portions, ample choices, exactly what you want from a diner!! Tonight I started with some French Onion soup, absolutely delicious!! Tasty broth, delicious onions, yummy melted cheese on top!!! For dinner, i had the Lasagna, good sauce, lots of meat, huge portion. Family had a Cuban sandwich, roasted pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, covered by Dijon mustard, excellent! Dad had the Meatloaf. Very good, lots of onions, smothered in a mushroom gravy, side of mashed potatoes. Central Diner is a go to favorite everytime."}
{"text":"Upscale for a diner, but enormous variety of food to suite anyone's taste on the menu, which is very \"diner like\".  Enormous entrée portion could easily feed two. Soup was good but entree was just okay...bland, overdone.  I'd be willing to go back but order something different."}
{"text":"I opted for an Italian dinner, in spite of the fact that Greek selections came first on the menu. Portions were very large, but the eggplant parm left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Central!! We come here a lot for Sunday Brunch and any time we have out of town guests come in, Central is one of the places we will bring them!

The ambiance is lovely; I dined here when it was a Denny's (which has a pretty basic look) and I am shocked that this place could look so good! The renovation is beautiful - it looks nice without you thinking that you're underdressed for the look or overdressed for a diner.

This place is often packed, but we are often here a high traffic times so I'm not sure if they ever have a slow time! 

The staff is great! The hosts/hostesses are friendly, the servers are attentive and the barracks/bus boys are so fast! The management are also great and very supportive of their staff. You can tell that the employees who work here enjoy it.

The food is excellent and the portions are huge! I have never had a bad plate. The Greek dishes are very good, but I love that they also have traditional American diner fare too. Central has a little something for everyone, so this place is great for a family or a group of people with different tastes.

I don't often have room left over for dessert, but once I got a slice of their raspberry almond torte cake (to go of course!) and it was delicious!! If I had any complaint, it may be that there are SO MANY cake options and when they're gone, they're gone, so they don't have a list. It's hard to know if you're making the right decision when you have to remember 14 different types of cake!

I think my life goal is to try everything on their menu, but I definitely have my favorites so that may be easier said than done!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We have never had a bad meal. The portions are generous. The service is friendly and attentive.  6 stars"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, great prices, and great food. I had a bowl of oatmeal that was HUGE and delicious. She let me add whatever I wanted with no extra charge so that's a huge plus! I sat there for a while and was not rushed at all. The place had such a classic, cozy diner feel and the staff really made it that way. If you're looking for a healthy breakfast option that won't leave you hungry, the oatmeal surely will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I had been hearing LOTS of good things about this diner. I finally had the opportunity to try it. It's definitely not your typical diner. It's almost like an Upscale Eat n Park. The decor is contemporary. They have a full bar. They have a small waiting area but we went at an odd hour of the day so we didn't have to wait. 
I am a huge fan of breakfast so I ordered chocolate chip pancakes. The portions are enormous!  The pancakes were really good. I took over half of my plate of pancakes home. (They were still good when reheated.)
Their menu is huge!!  The choices are almost overwhelming. They have amazing cakes. The table next to ours was celebrating a birthday and everyone ordered desserts. The slices of cake were also very large and the people at the table said they were delicious. 
I definitely want to go back and try more of their items. I was watching servers take plates to other people's tables and all of the food looked good. The dining area is large and can accommodate large parties of up to 14 or so people. 
If you haven't tried it you should go. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Large portions. Great service. They're alwaysssss busy but food comes out fast. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I decided to eat here after seeing how highly this eatery ranked in reviews online- 14th in the entire city on tripadvisor! Must be awesome, right? Wrong. I want to start off by saying that the service was out of this world; our waitress (I cannot remember her name, maybe Heather?) was kind, attentive, quick, and conversational. Everything else was awful. They claim to be a diner and grill but they definitely do not have a good balance of items from each; the menu was massive in size and about 4 pages long. The French onion soup was decent but not as amazing as they claim. My Caesar salad was good but my friends both had burgers and they were extremely disappointed. The burgers were clearly frozen, not fresh as the menu claimed. Very greasy and hard to eat, they couldn't even finish them. It wasn't the worst place I've ever eaten at but I certainly won't be back."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch haven't been there in a while I know they had some issues with mouse droppings and temperature of the food with the health department but I thought I'd give them a second chance the rap that I got was soggy and the vegetables for soggy overrated although the cakes look delicious and the case we tried a piece of their coconut lemon and it was so dry it was not fresh  Waitress had an attitude. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Extraordinary service, large portions for a good price. Delicious food. New favorite."}
{"text":"Central Diner & Grille gives off more of a grille feel than a diner but good nonetheless. The chicken pesto sandwich was fantastic, the coleslaw was very sweet for those that don't like it too bitter, and there were plenty of vegetarian options. Service was excellent and the patio is nice!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. I usually get a sandwich, either the steak or fish and you won't go away hungry that's for sure. My wife gets one of the specialty salads but hasn't been excited about them as they don't have very much variety in them, meaning they're mostly lettuce and not very much tomato or cucumber. I keep telling her with a menu as good as theirs stick to a side salad and entrée. So many great looking options."}
{"text":"Central Diner is my go-to restaurant if I'm out in Robinson area. Extensive menu with tons of interesting choices and breakfast is served all day. Some of my favorites include the gyro eggs Benedict and the monte cristo sandwich. They also have a creamy lemon chicken soup that is out of this world. Portions are gigantic: salad bowls as big as bathtubs, pancakes the size of the moon, and enough lamb shank to feed an entire pro hockey team. I always have leftovers to sustain me for a day or two. 

I can't say I've ever had a bad meal here. Though I did order the lasagna once and, although it was as big as a garden shed and very cheesy and texturally good, I didn't enjoy their red sauce. I'm extremely picky with red sauce though. If you stick to the more traditional Greek specials, you can't go wrong. 

Here's a tip: split a main course with a willing participant and save room for cake. There's an assortment to choose from. I've only ever had the lemon, but it was some of the best cake I've ever tasted. Of course the cake slices are as big as an encyclopedia, so it'll last you all week."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. You get a good amount of food for your buck and the food is pretty good. Only reason for two star is because of one of the servers.  

He decided to show us his bloody band-aid while we were eating. Other than that. The place was great. I'm sure it would be at least 4 stars without the little incident ha. 

I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Best resteraunt in the area.  Portions are huge and food is delicious.  (Both breakfast and dinner) It is hard to choose another reseraunt over this one.  I have been there 6 or 7 times and I have not been disappointed  yet.  Their dinner specials are always great.  On the dinner menu my go-to is the pasta with vodka sauce.  I usually have leftovers for days.  
The service is always great here and they really make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Great portions, excellent service, never a bad meal. I stop here a lot when in town and try something different each time. Their soup is always great. My favorite is the spanakopita pie."}
{"text":"Jennifer and Dimitri are top notch. The place is rocking now with the right crew.  It's the best place in the vicinity without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Robinson. Hands down. The portions are huge, the variety is amazing, lovely wine selection, and incredible desserts! (Medeterra Bakehouse yummies) I would seriously eat here every day if I could. I actually like the fact that you pay the bill up front at the register. And I love the fact that the owner is always around."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and great service I would recommend it to anyone our waitress crystal was very nice and took great care of us"}
{"text":"I've been here before and found that I really like their coffee. In the past I've always been here for breakfast. This time I came for lunch, and it was very satisfying.  We sat outside since the weather today was perfect!  I had a BLT with rye toast.  I really enjoyed the sandwich.  It was small and no frills which is exactly what I wanted.  The tangy flavor of the rye went really well with the bacon.  And the slice of orange at the end was a perfect end to my meal."}
{"text":"Food was great. Had the gyro and the sauce is nice and spicy.  Wife had the panini and she was pleased. Only complaint was that it was noisier than I'm used to for a restaurant. But that wouldn't keep me from coming back again."}
{"text":"Just touched down in PIT on our way to downtown. Thanks yelpers for this place! Service was lovely, sweet and simple. I had their My Big Fat Greek omelette and it was delicious. Their tzatziki sauce was garlicky, just the way I like it. My partner had the Denver omelette. It was cooked like it should have been. Wish we had the stomachs to try their desserts or even a pancake. This place was just what we needed to start the trip. Two omelettes for  $20. I call that a WIN!"}
{"text":"My favorite Greek food is at this place! Crunchy pita with a huge portion of lamb meat along with homemade tzatziki sauce. The Greek salad is also very good I won't eat a Greek salad anywhere else except for here because all other places their Greek salads well they just suck but not here it's very good along with their soft on the inside golden crunchy fries and tangy ranch dressing for dipping!! Always a great place to eat you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on Saturday and despite the fact that it was 2:30 in the afternoon it was super busy! That is usually a good sign of things to come. They have cakes in the display case at the entrance that looked amazing! Would like to try one of those one day if we make it back here. We were seated immediately and asked if we preferred a booth or table. Of course we said booth, but if I go back I will sit at a table. The booths are very confined and the seats are very upright and uncomfortable!  Our server Angela was very friendly and helped guide me through the menu letting me know the most popular items from each section. We went with 2 of her suggestions, the Cuban Panini and the Gyro. My panini was satisfactory, nothing extraordinary but very good. It was large enough I brought have of it plus half my sweet potato fries home for later. The sweet potato fries and onion rings are a dollar upcharge. My husband went with the Gyro. Wow. Huge! He said it was spectacular, although he did say he would like more tzatziki sauce on it, maybe ask if they'll bring more on the side for you. All in all the prices were decent and the serving sizes were very big. They even had a 10% military discount. Thank you."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and both times have been great.  This last time we had a group of 10 and all meals were huge so bring your appetite.  The dishes all taste great as well.  Service was fast and with a smile.  Now, the deserts... Wow. Plenty of choices, large and taste great.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a solid 4 star diner. In the past I've had friends complain about dirty dishes. I've seen that as the case - so don't bd afraid to speak up. However, I recommend it here for the food. French toast is incredible, hot turkey sandwich is delish and their in house rice pudding?! Shut the front door."}
{"text":"First venture to Central Diner.

Fried Pickles and Zucchini:  The Pickles were lightly charred on the grill then breaded.  Nice flavor.  The zucchini was long and light - the marinara that was served with both was A+++.

Hubs had the meatloaf and it was HUGE.  He enjoyed it last night and will enjoy it again today or tomorrow!  Friend had the Reuben and it was well stacked and not messy...  as some tend to be.  Friend #2 had the Cobb Salad - It was a monster and her favorite, they are not new to the Diner.  I chose the Bleu Burger and it was done perfectly - I had to ditch the bun part way through and abandon the fries altogether.  The slaw was not to my liking, very creamy and too wet for me, but that is my preference.

Overall: good service, big food and no frills."}
{"text":"Great place to take anyone with A big enough appetite. My friends and I decided to stop here after a movie. I had never been to the diner so I figured hey At least they have a vast menu and they serve breakfast all day.

We were seated right away in a booth which was very comfortable and large. Our waiter Aaron was a great at his job and was really accommodating especially for my friend who's very picky about what she eats. He was able to make me a virgin mint julep which tasted great!! 

I ordered the Greek eggs Benedict with a Greek side salad. The dressing on the salad is definitely the best that I've ever tasted. When my eggs Benedict came out the chunks of Gyro meat that were on them were humongous. Of course I couldn't eat it all because the English muffin was twice as big as what I'm used too. The Gyro meat was very flavorful and juicy the eggs were cooked perfectly and the hollandaise sauce just added that perfect creamy touch to the top. My husband ordered the veal Parmesan which was actually pretty decent. The marinara sauce they use is made in house and has small chunks of tomato in there so you know it's fresh. 

Our friends ordered a chef salad along with an omelette both of which were very filling. The salad alone came in this large bowl that was big enough for about four people to eat. 

After dinner we ordered a slice of one of their various cakes, it was mango and raspberry filled. I wasn't too thrilled about the cake, the bread was kind of dense and maybe on the dry side. I think next time I might skip dessert or try their rice pudding instead. 

All in all this is a great place to take your family or friends when you're not sure what to eat. The menu is large enough to accommodate anyone's  tastebuds from from Italian to Greek to American they pretty much have it all."}
{"text":"Being on the road a lot I tend to eat in diners and Central is probably the best around. Nice place and good food and good service. If you're near Robinson you should check it out. But come hungry!"}
{"text":"Today, I had my first heavenly experience at the Central Diner. We had Chicken Soulvaki (sp?), Greek salad and Chocolate Baklava.  Everything was exceptionally fresh, flavored and cooked. Some of the best Greek dressing I have ever had - I asked for more to eat with my fries. The lady across from us had one of their triple decker sandwiches, another guy had the Reuben and the creamiest looking coleslaw. I wanted everything I saw! This will be one of our weekly go tos on date night! Wonderful service, food and atmosphere - one of the best restaurants in the greater Pittsburgh area - hands down."}
{"text":"Driving thru Pittsburgh and decided to stop here. The size of the dishes are huge, one salad can feed a small family. The Gyro was amazing!! Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Not what you typically think when you hear the word diner. Clean and classy looking, this place has a diner type menu (lots of choices and lots of comfort food). The desserts are amazing to look at in the glass cases. The service both times I have come has been here has been very good. The food has been very good as well-large portions, hot, and great tasting. Make sure you check out the specials. The lasagna is awesome.  But if you want the Shepherd's Pie, come early, they run out fast. Overall, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh.  Very generous portions.  Large menu and great food."}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast. We were seated quickly even though it was busy. The area is large and appears to accommodate a lot of people. The service was good, but overall this place is nothing to rave about.. my husband got the eggs Benedict and i had the French toast. Good food but came out warmish almost cold. It looked like my husbands eggs Benedict had been sitting in the back for about 10-15 minutes. If you want a quick breakfast, seems like a good spot. My review definitely goes hand in hand with the others, cold and average food."}
{"text":"Center Diner is a big hit every time I've visited. The menu is extensive and everything they serve is supersized portions so be prepared to have leftovers. They have always been very accommodating to larger groups when I've been there as of late. The waitresses are always so friendly and nice. Their breakfast is my favorite! You definitely walk away full and satisfied at Central Diner & Grille!"}
{"text":"Was here first time. Everything is really good. Pasta ala vodka with shrimps is awesome!"}
{"text":"The look was nice and new, the dining area seemed a little packed but the food wasn't good at all. I got pancakes it was a huge portion that looked delicious but wasn't good at all they were dry and chalky I tried to Drench them in syrup but they only have little packets of syrup the home fries were cold, the toast had a oily butter and the eggs were watery. I was amazed on how bad the food actually was. It was my first and last time that I will be going to central."}
{"text":"Food was basic but decent. Service was slow and orders were not correct. Coffee was terrible. 3  because the eggs were pretty good."}
{"text":"Traveling on. Business and. My boss recommended this place. It's a traditional diner with large portions and tons to chose from. I had ribs which were sweet and tasty. Service a little slow. Delicious soup."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant probably a dozen times since they opened and I've never had a bad experience. There is an owner there almost 24/7 and they really keep the wait staff on the ball. They always make it a point to visit the tables, check in on customers and see how everything is going. If the restaurant is busy then of course it takes a little longer for food, but that happens everywhere. The food has always been very good, the prices are reasonable and I've never had a negative experience with one of the servers. I recommend Central to all of my out of town friends and they all love it! 

The only reason I've given this 4 stars instead of 5 is because their vegan/vegetarian choices are limited. Most everything is made with meat, cheese and/or eggs. I usually can only order the same 2-3 things each time, which is fine for me...but a little variety would be nicer. Still a great restaurant nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Excellent, simply stated. Met an old friend for lunch here today - my first time here. It was his recommendation, and boy wax it s good one! This place is clean, well kept, presents very well, and the staff wax friendly and quite attentive. The food? I had the Greek salad with gyro meat. Holy cow...it was huge, but even better, it was delicious! The dressing was terrific. My friend had an omelette and it looked great as well, and as he didn't leave any, I'm guessing it was good.
Very reasonably priced, solid menu, excellent staff, and a nicely set out place. Definately a high five here! Try it!"}
{"text":"It's funny that I work across the street from.this place and I waited about 8 months to eat here until my girlfriend came to town.  We have been here a few times since, and each time, we always try something different.  I have to say, that this place is fantastic!  The menu is so diverse for many different tastes.  In the four times we've been there, we are never disappointed.  The food is great, the portions are huge, and the service is friendly and inviting.  The owners certainly lead by example and are very involved in the business, which is a rarity to see, owners hosting, running food, cashiering, and taking orders.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about we're the fried pickles....the breading fell off and not a big fan of the fried Spears...I prefer pickle chips.  But I had the chicken salad was something of wonderful...I love chicken salad, and this was really tasty.  Big chunks of chicken, absolutely wonderful....we will be back time and time again...this place is always hopping...never not busy.  Definitely a must try when in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Now this was a birthday breakfast/brunch outing. We were in Robinson to get our car looked at and the man found this place on Yelp. The reviews looked good so we took the plunge. We got seated quickly and they even accommodated my foot (it is in a walking boot). I really appreciated them seeing that and realizing that sitting me close and not making me walk around would be really nice. 

The waitress was exceptional. Seriously. We wanted OJ but wanted to split it, she got us two glasses, Chris didn't like the sides, she made an accommodation since she saw his hesitation. It was awesome. She came around to check on us and chat, but wasn't overbearing and in the way. I loved her.

I ordered the Greek Eggs Benedict with the side of home fries. I ordered the home fries extra crispy. This sometimes is where the restaurants fail. You say crispy and they think, \"eh, she can't really mean that.\" Oh but I do. The home fries came out perfect. The reason that they do not get four stars and only three is because of the meat on the Greek Eggs Benedict. I saw them put the new spit of \"meat\" on while I was sitting there. I knew at that time that the meat on my food would be the leftover crunchies or just dry, and I was right. Some pieces were good, others were super old tasting (crunchy and dry). The meal would have been perfect, but that meat was a no go. 

They were saved from the dreaded two stars by the fact that they gave me a free piece of cake for my birthday that looks amazing and is huge. I would like to do 3.5 stars but that is not allowed."}
{"text":"There's a swanky, late-night, Rat Pack-era, cosmopolitan charm to Central Diner & Grille that has no parallel in the Pittsburgh area. Men and women from the service industry dressed in suits, ties, and other such formal attire dined alongside my loose band of rapscallion metalheads after a concert at Altar Bar. The manager could be see waiting on patrons sans a tie, indicating a hectic night handled with grace and class after 12am. 

My insane friends decided it would be a good idea to go there for pie and milkshakes, braving a potential winterstorm. 

The snow didn't start falling until well into the morning, but most of my friends had their pie and milkshakes...together. 

You see, my friends had their pies (and in one case, cheesecake) blended into their milkshakes with no crosseyed looks. Their requests were accommodated famously by Alexander, our affable server. 

When one pal went against the peer pressure and ordered a roast beef dinner, Alex asked, \"You want that in a milkshake too?\" The man had a sense of humor. 

I too was an...

No, I would order a mammoth of a gyro, one with meat as succulent and juicy as hamburger cooked medium-rare, a pita as fluffy as a sesame seed bun, and a tzatziki as creamy as a fresh mayonnaise. 

The scratch-made mastery was also apparent in the dark fortress that was their brownie sundae. The brownies themselves were as dense as a candy bars and had a crisp tuille-ish exterior. Topping it were globes of golden vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, walnuts, Oreo scraps, and chocolate chips. 

My hessian allies were awestruck at how I vanquished it all. 

CD&G's mission is real. If an anti-chain revolt is to occur in Robinson, they will be leading the charge."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch early afternoon.  Hubby ordered chicken fingers and french fries from the kids menu and I ordered their veggie omelette.

What's hot
- Flavor, our meals were pretty decent.  Nothing that blows your mind, but it's alright.  The cheese in my veggie omelette was mostly in the middle and didn't go through the entire omelette.  I didn't see the cauliflower in my veggie, but I, guessing it was there. Call me picky, but dudes, details matter.  
- Menu variety.  They serve breakfast all day, which is awesome.  They have some Greek and Italian menu options in their own section.  They have a children's meal section, too.  It's nice to see a gyro as an option.  Dunno how fresh the meat is, but there ya go.
- Parking lot is a good size.  This place seems to be pretty popular among the locals, which means it can get busy fast.  Their parking lot is accommodative of that, which is great.
- Layout.  The inside is a good space and can accommodate a decent number of people.  But be aware, this place gets busy fast.  

What's not
- Service.  Our waitress didn't give us any bread.  We didn't notice that others were getting a bread basket until we left.  In other words, we saw bread baskets on other tables and that's when we figured out we didn't get one.  In other words, their service is shoddy.  Additionally, we had to wait quite a while for our waitress to take our order.  Another waitress had to ask us if we needed anything.  We told her we were ready to order, but couldn't find our waitress.   
- Traffic.  Getting in and out of the parking lot is a chore and can take a while because of the surrounding traffic.  While this isn't within the restaurant's control, it's something to be aware of.

Final answer
Am willing to come back, but not a first choice."}
{"text":"I went here about maybe 2x. The last time I went was mother's day...last yr I believe.

The Belgian waffles were good, but the pancakes were burnt & bacon greasy.

Not to mention the 1 in Robinson township was shut down, because of a mouse problem & something about food being left out w/flies around them"}
{"text":"The first few times I had went, the food was pretty good, I particularly loved their french onion soup. I had taken my mom there one night for dinner, (after going on about how good it was). The French onion soups cheese was burnt to a crisp, not sure why they sent it out, and for dinner I had the turkey, stuffing, and mashed potatoes. The turkey wasn't bad, expect for the odd taste from sitting on top of the stuffing. I had pulled the turkey off and the stuffing turned out to be raisin bread, just a slice. I had asked the waitress if this was supposed to be the cinnamon swirl bread or if there was a mistake. She went and got the manager, who was a huge guy that was just plan rude. On top of that, my moms chicken sandwich was raw in the middle. Not the best dinner...."}
{"text":"Great food, coffee and service.  Restaurant is very clean. I was here for breakfast. There are a lot of options.  The lunch and dinner menu seemed very large. I hope to be able to come back and try non breakfast food."}
{"text":"Have visited twice in the last couple of weeks.
First visit was for lunch and sat at the counter.  It was rather noisy but not to bad since I was by myself.  My waitress gave me good service but did not say anything and was busy.  The manager/owner did stop for a quick, \"How is everything\".  My Greek chicken panini was dried out tasteless chicken, a surprise since this place seems to get such good reviews.  The fries and cole slaw that came with are what you would expect.

We decided to give it a try for breakfast.  We were expecting a wait and the hostess said 10 to 12 minutes.  We were surprised by her estimate.  Well 45 minutes later we were called and seated.  
The place is so noisy we had a hard time talking/hearing each other.  Our waitress leaned way over the table to talk with us.  Did I mention it is way to noisy/load.  Our waitress was good and provided refills.
I had the blueberry pancakes.  The fresh blueberries were good, the pancakes were large but just OK not sure how to describe but just OK, not as good as a couple of other little diners we usually go to.  Also, a little more expensive.  Others had the french toast and bacon and were happy with their meal.  I did get a couple pieces of their bacon because they received so many pieces -- and the bacon was really good, thick and cooked perfectly.  

Portions are large.  Service is good.  Food is OK, but nothing exceptional.
Did I mention Very Noisy!"}
{"text":"Always a solid breakfast. Large portions and fast efficient service. Eggs Benedict are well done with a hollandaise that ways on point and isn't separating. Omelette are large and they have a wide variety to choose from.  I tend to get the Spanish omelette with chorizo. This place won't disappoint fans of diner style breakfast."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times now. It has become my favorite place to eat. Everything seems to be made from scratch. You can really taste the freshness!! It is sooo delicious! I had shepards pie the first time and it was so different from what I normally make (I cook only from scratch also) but it was unbelievable! The size of the meals are huge! I ate half of it and split the rest with my daughter for lunch the next day!! I think it was about 10 bucks! And came with a salad!!!  The service is wonderful and the place is very very clean, but really what makes this place for me is knowing that I am getting a quality meal that hasn't been frozen or processed, but is soooo yummy! :) the location kinda stinks, but honestly I would run across that 6 lane road like frogger to get some more of that shepards pie!! Seriously!"}
{"text":"Great place , we went for brunch and they have a great selection and accommodate very well to picky eaters :) 
The manager was very hands on and came around to check if everything was going well , the waitress was very nice too and the food was great. Very fast staff 
Only thing I might not like was that there was no spaghetti available until later in the day."}
{"text":"Don't let the \"diner\" in the name fool you, this place is great!  The atmosphere is a little \"diner\"ish, but very clean and well kept.  The food is amazing!  You get a lot for your money and everything is delicious.  The dessert are amazing!  I keep going back every chance I get."}
{"text":"Not terrible, not exceptional. 

Visually, the restaurant is very nice. Everything looks clean and new. Well lit, decorated nicely, etc. It can be very loud inside when it's crowded, but that's to be expected. 

The service is good. The staff is friendly and so is the management. The managers seem to be very hands-on instead of simply watching everybody. They're always running somewhere to do something. Often times people who are not even serving my table will stop by to check on us. That's always a nice thing to see. 

The food is average in my opinion. They do have a huge menu, so that's a plus. I've had a burger and it was a little on the greasy side. The fries are very good. Onion soup is great. Reuben sandwich was pretty decent. Like I said, the food isn't incredible but it's not gross either. I will definitely return, though. Overall I enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"Our first visit, and boy are we impressed.  Ask for Monica - she will take care of you!  Our son has food allergies - no problem!  The chef came to our table and customized his kid's meal with a smile.  Portion sizes are beyond generous!  Clean, sleek decor, super-friendly and helpful service, and great food.  P.S. Love lamb?  Be sure to visit on a Thursday!"}
{"text":"I had only been here once before. I visited for breakfast today and ordered the cream cheese and chive omelet. It was a good portion for the price and pretty tasty. I'd say the real winner was the coffee. Super strong blend. The waitress was attentive and provided great service. The manager stopped over to check on us. I'll definitely return"}
{"text":"I'm back in the Pittsburgh area for work and after a colleague recommended \"Central Diner\", I thought I try it out.
What a lovely dinner!  More upscale than a classic diner, the menu goes in and on.  There is a nice wine selection, and full bar. 
I had one of the evening specials.  The food was yummy.  My server, Seth, was great!  He was attentive, helpful with recommendations, very friendly and professional!
The next time I'm in town, I will definitely be coming back!  Next time: French Onion Soup!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but this deserves one. Excellent food, if you can't decide what to eat, come here! They have a little bit of everything. Great atmosphere. Clean. Inviting. Had 2 men at separate times check up on us and took the time to acknowledge our little one. We are out-of-towners and will keep this place in mind next time we are in town. Thanks for a pleasant evening!"}
{"text":"I went to the Central Diner for the first time yesterday (Sunday, April 13th).  My mother was in town for her birthday, and we were between 2 places, and this is where she chose.  

I was incredibly disappointed in the food.  I got a salad with chicken and ranch dressing on the side.  First - the salad set up is bizarre.  I chose the build your own salad, with spring mix with the addition of chicken.  The salad had no cheese, no veggies, nothing.  Just spring mix lettuce for $6!  Then an additional $5 for chicken.  The price of the additional chicken was reasonable.  But the fact that the lettuce - JUST lettuce was $6 - I found outragous!  It would have been more reasonable if the chicken was $6 (I think it's actually $5.95, but close enough!)

The chicken was - gross.  I haven't never eaten such terrible chicken at a restaurant.  It had freezer burn, with some pieces still frozen.  I told our waitress, who just kept saying \"It's good isn't it?\"  It was not.  It was FAR from good.  Sadly, I think I got a small touch of food poisoning from the 3 bites of food (Lettuce, chicken, and ranch dressing) I took.  Within 10 minutes of leaving - I was in the restroom 4 times in 30 minutes.  It was not pleasant.

I typically give places 2 chances - because sometimes your first stop isn't the best.  But I can't imagine giving this place another chance.  Be careful with what you order, just be aware.  Freezer burn chicken, lettuce that probably wasn't washed , just not good."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty food. Had a basic chicken Cobb salad and the chicken was awesome. Greek food was good too. Wide array on menu. Comfortable atmosphere to just swing in any time. Full bar service was a plus."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, the most recent being this morning for Father's Day brunch. Just as it was the first time, the meal today was amazing. I had the Nutella Pancake special and it was so decadent. And such a huge portion! 

We had reservations but still had to wait a bit because it was so busy for a holiday. It was worth the wait. The menu is extensive and everyone enjoyed their meals. For breakfasts out I always ask for toast before the rest of the meal comes out to keep my year old son occupied. Often the wait staff forgets, but not here. It was brought out right away. I really appreciate that. 

The restaurant is large so you never feel crowded, and even on a busy day we didn't feel rushed at all."}
{"text":"This is our second time here and it's great! The food and service are exceptional. Highly recommend this restaurant if your in town"}
{"text":"If you're into authentic New Jersey-style diners, this place is for you. Wonderful selection of classic \"feel good\" dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner -- try to save room for dessert!

For breakfast I got the Nova lox omelet, my fiance got a Napoleon French toast (strawberries, bananas and pecans over challah bread French toast all covered in honey) and we split a parfait of their homemade rice pudding (no judging). Everything we ordered fantastic... I can't wait to go back to try more!

To top it all off, the staff was so nice and on their game. Five stars all around!"}

{"text":"Is there such a thing as a greasy SILVER spoon?  This might be it.

Hunger struck while hunting for picture frames in Robinson, and getting something else custom framed for the new house, and instead of hitting the usual mass produced haunts, a friend suggested the Central Diner.

From the outside it looks all shiny and diner-ish, if not a tad more upscale than the usual 'diner'.

To me, a 'diner' is a little hole-in-the-wall that serves a variety of basic foods in decent sized portions for very reasonable prices. In days gone by (WAY by) a diner was one place that you could count on to get a legitimate decent meal to fill you up and not pillage your wallet. In current times, however, diners have become more 'fast food' than fast food. In other parts of the world a diner is still a place to grab things like a damned good real burger or a weekly special like home made chicken and dumplings. In South Florida they were one of the last bastions of decent American food in a land quickly drowning in either rice and beaneries or uppity bistroids serving those $30 art projects on plates. If you wanted a REAL ground beef burger down there, you went to a diner. For some odd reason in Pittsburgh, over the last couple of decades, 'diners' have become not much more than reheated frozen goods from the Sysco trucks. That's not a burger, it's a frozen grey hockey puck. 

So upon entry to the Central Diner, the atmosphere was not so much 'diner' as it was an upscale Applebee's posing as a diner. It really isn't a diner.

Now, THAT being said, although I would NOT call it a diner, I would call it a decent restaurant choice when stuck in that side of suburban mall hell. 

We were very quickly and very politely seated in a booth (and we were given the option of booth or table) by a very clean cut young lady. Within moments our server, another very polished and polite young lady, brought us our menus and took our drink orders. Pepsi products. Ick. So once again into the fresh brewed iced tea breach, which came to the table quickly.

The menu is enormous, and quite varied, from the basic breakfasts to the full entrees. Choices, choices, choices...but more than likely, something for everyone.

We opted for burgers and fries (it was lunch time). Mine was the Central Burger, which was kind of a breakfast burger, with a black angus burger topped with ham and cheddar cheese, along with a fried egg. My friend had a bacon blue cheese burger. They were more or less cooked to order (I do prefer my medium rare truly on the 'rarer' side), very flavorful, and came with a pile of nicely crispy but not overdone fries. They checked in every few minutes to make sure all was well, and that our beverages were topped off, and were completely polite and helpful. And at one point a steamingly handsome dark haired manager came over to check on how we were enjoying things.

After our meals they offered us a dessert menu, and my friend, who had been there before, asked if they still had their carrot cake, and when the server said yes, that was all he needed to hear. 

This was some mighty fine and mighty LARGE carrot cake, apparently from some bakery there in Robinson. It was pretty much a perfect wedge of carrot cake, enough for two, drizzled with some kind of caramel sauce and dolloped with whipped cream around the plate. The flavor was rich and complete, and the cream cheese frosting was thick and plentiful...and just right.

The entire experience was very pleasant and very fulfilling. My only shortage on the stars, as usual, is the pricing. Most things on this 'diner' menu started at $10 and climbed from there. And in some cases, it was a pretty tall ladder. I didn't pay this trip, but just going by the individual prices for what we'd ordered, I'd say that this crossed over the $40 range...for lunch.

But, I WILL say, that when making the suburban mall excursion to Robinson, this is definitely one of the best choices in the area, and regardless of the priciness, I would likely drop by again."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the portions were huge. 

Came for breakfast. Had the Greek omelet, Greek Benedict, corned beef hash, and the silver dollar pancakes. Gyro meat was very good. Corned beef was a good mix of meat and taters. And the silver dollar pancakes were of some other currency because I haven't seen silver dollars that big before. 

Dor Stop is my favorite breakfast but this is a close second."}
{"text":"Love the place. I am personally drawn to this place because of their Greek Food. Their Greek salad is the best one I have had by a mile. Service is always good and I am sure that their home made pies are just as good although I have never found myself with room to get to them. Highly recommend. The staff is courteous and nice. The owner/manager could smile a little bit more if you ask me as he looks as if he is always unhappy. On the other hand, he always have treated us with respect and grace although you can see that he is a very busy man..."}
{"text":"Central Diner is such a hidden gem.  I wish they would just take the word \"Diner\" off their name because this restaurant deserves to be placed in a much higher category.  Having been here four times now and impressed every time they have earned my 5 stars.  

When you walk in the restaurant is impressive.  The design is well done and it gives off a high end appearance.  As you are seated in large comfortable booths or at the tables and presented the large menu, you might just feel overwhelmed as pretty much everything looks appealing.  You mean I have to pick just one?  The menu ranges from 3 different kinds of eggs Benedict to stuffed French toast for breakfast.  They also have lunch and dinner but I never seem to get that far.  The portions are large and the price is very reasonable.  They also always have lots of specials that change every time I've been in.  I did get shepherds pie on special once for lunch and it was delish. It was a huge square cut with homemade mash and a great meat / vegetable bottom.  Very tasty indeed.  

Do yourself a favor and give central a try.  I'm positive you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"This diner is hands down the BEST around.  I've only ever really been here for breakfast/brunch but have never had a bad experience.  The food portions are huge and always come out quick.  There is typically a short wait on the weekends but don't be discouraged, it's never as long as they quote.  The owner is always helpful and pleasant making you feel welcome.  And, all of the staff goes above and beyond."}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner. We both got sandwiches- my husband got the Monte Cristo and I got the cheesesteak. Everything came out quickly and hot. My husband thought the bread on his sandwich was a little doughy, but I was happy w my meal. The coleslaw was delicious, but it could have been seasoned a little more. I would like to try this diner for breakfast; it looks like their specialty."}
{"text":"Me and the hubby have not gone out to breakfast in forever. We decided to check out somewhere new and chose The Central Diner. Wow! The vibe...totally diner with an updated chic feel. And the food totally scrumptious! I had the Napoleon Challah French toast - oh my goodness - 2 huge pieces of French toast topped with strawberries , bananas, pecans, and a little bit o' honey. I don't know how they did it but the French toast, not even slightly soggy even with all of the goodness on top. I also got a side of home fries which were yummy, just the slightest hint of onion. And sausage...and they weren't little links either. They were nice and big...yummy! The hubby chose the pancakes with eggs over easy and bacon. He loved it all. The pancakes were huge! They were so good you don't even need any syrup. And the bacon...a little crisp, delightful! I got a blueberry muffin to go and ate it later.  It was full of blueberries. The texture was just perfect, soft and full of blueberries (did I say that already:) full of blueberries!). And the service was fabulous! Our waitress was prompt. We also didn't need anything. She was on it, checking on us regularly and filling our glasses as needed. It was a terrific way to start the day and we would love to go and try dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Rating is based more on the fact I ordered the pork chop dinner for $17 to go but that's all I got pork chops and the side salad, really disappointing.  Chops are good but 17 for 2 pork chops and a salad is a bit much.  Service was pretty good so I'm a bit miffed as to how they would forget my side.  Sad since I really wanted this to be a good review  and I was going to come back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I like this place because it combines all of my favorite things. Breakfast all day, open late, and really good food. They have a great variety on the menu, from BLT to daily specials like swordfish and shepherds pie. They also have great Greek food (spanakopitaaaa!!!). Everything I've ever had here has been spot on. Good service, too."}
{"text":"This rating is definitely for the overall experience of the place.  We went here for brunch on Sunday, after church, and were nervous about a long wait.  Luckily they have plenty of seating and the wait was less than 15 minutes.  We needed a highchair which they were able to accommodate easily.  
The food came at a reasonable time, and I ordered the French Toast Napolean.  This was the THICKEST french toast I have ever had.  The portion sizes here are insane.  I also got a size of their sausage, which was some of the best breakfast sausage I've had.  
A member of my group ordered the berry pancakes, and for whatever reason, they weren't ready when everyone else's food was.  Instead of making us all wait and giving us heat lamp warmed food, they brought our food - AND a whole plate of regular pancakes for my friend to eat while she waited for her food.  This was very unnecessary, but the main reason for the 5 star rating. 
The food was all very good - solid - I wouldn't say there was anything special or amazing about it, but nothing was bad, or even okay.  I think the food is a solid 4 stars, but with the whole experience factored in, they get the 5 star rating.  
Our friend has already been back twice, and it's only been 2 weeks if that says anything about them.  
Definitely, a great stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing little find. The food is excellent and to say the portions are generous is like saying Pittsburgh is fond of sports aka the worlds largest understatement. I would recommend it to anyone but make sure you're hungry when you show up. The staff are exceptionally nice and the place is clean as anywhere I've been. Make sure you get desert to go - trust me you won't have room until later!"}
{"text":"This is a place that my boyfriend and I frequent for breakfast. They always have delicious food, sometimes it just doesn't come out as hot as I would like. The home fries are so delicious and while they weren't what I originally expected, they were a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"This place is a great family friendly restaurant with a huge menu that's sure to make everyone in your family happy! I will have to update my review after we eat here a few more times but for now it's a solid four stars.

We went there for lunch  and got the greek salad with chicken, London broil sandwich and bread pudding for desert. 

The Greek salad is huge and delicious!! It's exactly what you want when you order a greek salad. It came with warm soft pita bread and their great house dressing. The meat on the London broil sandwich was also great! Very flavorful and perfectly cooked. The only issue with the sandwich was the bun. With high expectations for the garlic roll as described in the menu, the basic soggy hamburger was a bit of a let down.

The bread pudding was also a big let down! The ice cream that came with it was awesome but the desert itself wasn't worth ordering. It's a fruitcake like pudding that was served at room temperature. With so many other amazing looking deserts I would not recommend it order this again.

Overall a great restaurant with a fantastic staff!"}
{"text":"This has become my go to spot. The parking is easy, the wait is never long. The diner itself is very clean and I love the atmosphere compared to the majoroty of divy diners around here. I usually order a reuben which is around $10 and comes with their amazing coleslaw, pickle and fries. Needless to say I always walk away full and happy. Obviously their gyro meat is fresh and a must try. Great place, great service."}
{"text":"Delicious food, quick and friendly service, excellent atmosphere, extensive menu. A wonderful place to eat."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! The taste was excellent, the portions large and the service, terrific! I had the house bread with was WARM when it arrived. I can count like only one other restaurant that serves warm house bread.

The next thing I got was the French Onion Soup. It was an up charge but it was so worth it.  I got the Meat Loaf and it was so amazing. I got extra gravy to go with it and man, best tasting meat loaf I had in a while. I even had some extra to take home and eat later. One thing I liked that they offer here is one of your sides can be Spaghetti. Thats like a meal in itself. I really like the variety I got with my dinner.

Honestly, I was not only impressed with the food (which was incredible), but the quality of care we received from the staff. The manager was visable on the floor checking on customers, the waitstaff was checking in but not obnoxious and overbaring, and the food was totally worth it. 

As we were leaving, the dessert case looked so good and wanted a slice of everything. I was full and still wanted dessert, thats how good it looked. 

I will return and tell my friends that this is a terrific restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've had so many different things here all of which are amazing. 
Best breakfasts ever for sure. My last meal was a Greek Omelette and it was perfection. My date had a salad with grilled chicken and other things on it and I got to sample that as well. Absolutely perfect. 

Wait staff is always super friendly to me and my dog when we sit on the patio too."}
{"text":"This place is clean with up to date decor.  My Greek omelet was over cooked. It was piping hot to the point it had no flavor. They were skimpy with the ingredients. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal there. When we as a family go to robinson we usually always end up here to eat. I usually get what ever special they have. A few times I ordered the salmon with crab cake special, which surprised me and my wife because I was never typically fond of either. It was amazing and the portions were large enough for a left over meal later. 

The service has always been great and I have met the owner and wife a few times. 

My Wife and I both lived in NYC and If you are looking for a diner with food similar to New York City this is your place."}
{"text":"It is not often that a person finds a diner that serves Greek food. Normally they originate from NY but here you have a nice assortment of not only Greek food but Greek dessert as well.
They have a wide variety of entrée, salad, and sandwich selections here and portion sizes are generous! I opted for the traditional \"diner\" meatloaf. It came smothered in a delicious mushroom gravy. I paired it with a bowl of French onion soup and a \"stalk\" of broccoli as a side. It was absolutely delicious!!!
Breakfast is offered all day although I have not had the chance to try it. I'm sure from what I have eaten before I would not be disappointed.
The place is very clean, the staff is warm and friendly. Prices are reasonable. The parking lot is always full.
It is truly worth going out of your way for. Make sure to bring a doggy bag. You'll need it!"}
{"text":"Its not a terrible place to eat... well kinda... maybe ok so I'm pushing it a bit.  The service was excellent I cant complain there. The atmosphere was pretty much what you would expect for this style of resturant although the temperature control could have been better (it was freezing in there). 

  However when it came to the food, It was not great at all.  We ordered an omelet with broccoli and instead of hash browns my partner got Fries that he gave to me and he wanted Mellon which they offered in their menu as a side to the omelet.  First they didn't have the Mellon which was a bummer, then when we get our meals they seemed tough and barely edible.  My pancakes where ok but its not hard to make pancake batter out of something like Bisquick or some knock off.  The Sausage that came with my meal was horrendous, the bacon didn't even resemble bacon, the syrup they brought was pre-packaged Smuckers syrup (so i cant really blame them too much for how bad that was other then the choice of syrup but what ever) and the toast was pretty much stone cold. 

  Then I tried the fries that came with his meal, they tasted as if they had been fried in burnt grease.  Any one who has ever worked in fast food/ refreshments probably knows what I'm talking about.  Heck even if you have eaten at a McDonalds that hasn't changed their grease often enough you know what I mean.
  
  I don't know if the place was having a bad night or not but for our first time there, It will probably be our last."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service and huge portions.  I had the Nova and onion omelette with a side of hash browns.  Patty took great care of us and was attentive and fun."}
{"text":"The best restaurant experience I've ever had. I ordered the Challah French Toast with sausage and they had a beautiful crisp and absorbed the syrup like a pro. Kelly, our server, was very friendly and even went out of her way to find orange marmalade for my mom. Central Diner & Grille has a very welcoming atmosphere. With excellent service, amazing food and an inviting dining area, this restaurant may even be worth the 6 hour drive from New York!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. Never had an experience with bad service, the portions are seriously giant. 
It can get really loud in here at peak dining times but that also means it's a good spot if you're looking for a place out with a young family. 
Brunch and dinner just can't be beat for the price."}
{"text":"We love the music (jazz)!  The salads are fresh and crispy. The portions are huge! Waitresses are friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Looove Central Diner! My boyfriend and I always get the Big Fat Greek Omlette and Blueberry pancakes. Really great and hardworking staff/ managers that run the place on busy weekends. Definitely recommend for great food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visit Central Diner at least once a week for dinner. I don't usually order a salad as a main course, but their chef salad is amazing. They put so much turkey, roast beef, ham, and cheese on it that it's hard to finish it all. But I usually always do. One piece of advice is to ask for the roast beef to be well done, because sometimes it comes out a little too raw for my liking (like prime rib, of which I am not a fan). Also, the dining room itself can get pretty loud, and for some reason its always cold. Nonetheless, it could be 20 degrees with kids screaming, and I would still go there for their chef salad alone. I can't really speak to the rest of the menu, because I rarely stray from what I like."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Pittsburgh and I heard a lot about this place from my family. I decided to stop by my last night in town and had the pleasure of meeting Jared S. He was an amazing waiter and really funny. I definitely enjoyed my time here and will stop by whenever I'm in town again! Thank you Jared!"}
{"text":"Busy place so we figured this is where the locals hang out and we were right. The Greek lemon chicken soup bowl was huge! Gyro was huge and tasted great. 

Service was fast and was spot on with recommendations"}
{"text":"Breakfast has been great here.we decided to try it for dinner..WOW
Great wine  pours ! great fish ,some of the best I have had in the Burgh
Fresher fish than I have had in fancy Pgh. Restaurant"}
{"text":"Post-Gazette 9/14/16

\"The Allegheny County Health Department posted a yellow \"Consumer Alert\" warning at Central Diner & Grill in Robinson for recurring food safety violations.

Some of the problems uncovered during an inspection Tuesday at the Steubenville Pike eatery included food being held at unsafe temperatures, bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods, flies in the kitchen and improper cooling procedures.\""}
{"text":"If sandwiches with moldy bread and terrible service intrigues you, this is the restaurant for you! So I'll start from the beginning, we get there around 830pm and get seated promptly at a booth so we're happy, then our server comes around and takes our drinks, I asked for a raspberry tea and my date was cool with water. 15 minutes go by and our server is no where to be found then some random guy comes over and does the whole spiel again but I decided I was okay with the water our first server brought. So he takes our order and I ordered a Philly cheesesteak sub with fries and Cole slaw. After he took our order our server never came back until he brought the food out about 20 minutes later. So so far so good. A little misunderstanding with the first server but nothing big enough to ruin our dining experience. So I start eating my sub and I take a couple bites and then start eating the fries and I look down and I see mold on my break of my sub. I instantly stopped eating and told my date there's mold on my bread so we wait there for about 10 minutes for our server to come back but he never did so my date got up and went to find him at the computer where he was ringing another order in. He tells him about the mold and the server comes over and takes the sub and says \"oh sorry about that\" and then goes back to the kitchen. Then comes to tell me he's getting me another one (really not sure I want to eat here at this point) but a few minutes later the manager comes and brings me the new sub and says \"sometimes the kitchen gets so hot the bread goes bad, my apologies. I will send a desert back to you\" so yeah whatever pretty sure mold has to do with freshness and not heat. I've worked in plenty of restaurants to know this. So then the manager leaves I eat some of my sub then we wait another 15 minutes for our check and boxes: our server never came to check on us once I got the new sub. So we get our check and he asks us what dessert we want and we got it. But overall worst service I have ever had. I will never come back unless I'm craving moldy bread. For a place that just had a heath code violation a year ago you'd think they would pay attention to the freshness of the food they're serving."}
{"text":"From the time we walked into the restaurant we had a good feeling about this place. We were right the portions were enormous and the food was delicious. The service was by someone who is a professional waitress.  The special of the day Greek chicken soup. It was really amazing.  Wow everyone who had food around the restaurant was happy.   they have a special talent with any Greek food. Don't hesitate to visit this jewel."}
{"text":"It was pretty good.

We went in late morning/lunch time wanting omelets. We ate lunch instead. We had a Grilled Rachel - it was okay, Chicken parm sandwich - not a fan, and a burger- pretty good. We had a side of pancakes, because who wouldn't - very good.

Huge cake dessert choices and pies. No diner is a diner without them. Our death by chocolate cake was okay, nothing fabulous.

I have a feeling breakfast would be the best thing on the menu. I am willing to go back and try and find something that I love."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the first couple of times I'd say it was just \"eh\". Visits after that improved but not dramatically. Food is hit or miss. Sometimes it's good and sometimes not so good. 
Service is lacking too; almost always it seems like servers are flustered and unable to keep orders and requests straight.
For instance requesting no mayo and having the sandwich come out smothered in it.
Not likely I'll return."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a late night dinner with my mother in law, grandmother in law and my husband. 

We each ordered a dinner entree that came with a soup or salad, bread, and entree with side. The size of the portions was absolutely enormous. I had the roumanian steak and it was cooked correctly and tasted pretty good (it could have used a little more salt). 

I really liked the homemade greek vinaigrette dressing, but the salad itself was kind of sad, limp, and randomly had uncooked cauliflower on it. 

I would definitely want to return and try their breakfasts, but I am not sure that I would order dinner again as it was just ok. 

The service was pretty good. They gave us the time we needed without hovering, but the soda tasted a little flat and we had to ask for water refills."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for breakfast after a hike around Raccoon Creek State Park. I chose the Central based on how close it was to the park and how favorable the reviews were. My server was sweet and attentive. Maybe the lunch and dinner are more exceptional, but the breakfast was not impressive. I asked for the pastrami omelette with home fries. What I got was scrambled eggs with a small amount of chopped up pastrami in it. (an omelette is eggs folded over the ingredients). No cheese in it, nothing to make it worth the $8.95 price tag. The home fries were obviously left over baked potatoes, peeled, hacked up and  briefly re-heated on a griddle. While I do not mind the idea of not wasting food by using up leftovers, the taste of a rewarmed baked potato is not what I was looking forward to after my walk. Hubby got the \"golden Brown Pancakes\" with Canadian bacon. He's not one to complain, especially when I was picking up the tab and the whole thing was my idea, but he said they were nothing special. The price was good, though. Any time I can pay 20 bucks on a sit-down meal it's fine with me. 
On a side note: I hope the woman that passed out in the parking lot is OK."}
{"text":"My party of four went to the Central Diner on two recommendations.  The diner offered a lovely outdoor patio which is covered.  The night we went the temperatures were too high for sitting out doors.  At the entrance a dessert case features Hugh, Tall, beautiful looking cakes.  Serious attention getters to make planning how much you eat a consideration.

Each of us ordered something different, the lasagna was the daily special, stuffed pepper, chef salad, and spinach pie.  The lasagna is not on the Menu and is only as a daily special.  The chef salad is enormous.  Seriously three people could eat this.  Pinwheels of turkey and roast beef and cheese.  The dressing comes on the side.  The spinach pie is quite a large piece and tasty.  Three of us had the house salads.  The waitress said they are made fresh.  That may be true, but the shredded red cabbage was dried and brown on the edges.  One of us had the French onion soup and was graded very good.

The service was good on friendliness and taking orders.  Slow on clearing plates between courses.  We ordered cake for dessert to share.  Although a beautiful presentation the cake textures of coconut cream filled and coconut lemon filled cakes were dense and dry.  The icing though not overly sweet was hard.

Central diner offer many choices, and the serving sizes are jumbo sized.  Plan on taking part of your meal home or sharing.  The food is good.  My reasons for less than four stars is the salad, cakes and table clearing."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a trip to the airport. Excellent food! Excellent service. Had a Greek omelette and home fries. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Holy food, the portion sizes here are amazing. We came here for breakfast and got a Gyro Benedict and the Garden Omlette and had plenty of leftovers. The Gyro Benedict was tasty - the lamb was cooked perfectly and the tzatziki sauce was loaded with garlic and it was very good (my breath will definitely be smelling of garlic after this but it'll be worth it).

We also got cheesecake that was very dense and tasted good.

Definitely a good value diner, you basically get two meals in each portion size (would recommend splitting if you aren't super hungry)."}
{"text":"This restaurant was such an unexpected surprise. The food was delicious and the service was incredible. So, I went back and we got the same service and the food was incredible again. Every time we come here, we are impressed. And, my boyfriend and I are picky. We like good service and we expect the food to be worth the cost. This restaurant supercedes all our expectations. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I love this place. I first found it while traveling four years ago and it was excellent. Nice friendly people, excellent food, good prices, portions are plenty for you, etc.  Then just last week I was traveling in the same area and just had to return to Central Diner and I'm glad I did!  Waiter Seth was ultra attentive and fast, and I loved the salmon special, plus a nice glass of Cabernet.  Try this place - you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"This place is just incredible. Lots of choices from their menu. Service is great and the owners really care about you, the customer, being pleased. Save room for dessert or get it to go, they are delicious. Hidden Greek treasure right here in Western Pa."}
{"text":"Huge portions, great food. Had the Greek omelette and a stuffed French toast. Refreshing spot in a sea of chain restaurants in Robinson! Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and drove up and down this strip hoping to find something good that wasn't a chain. This place looked packed, so we figured there had to be a reason for that. 

We got Spanakopita as an appetizer. The phyllo was slightly too done but the filling was very good. It was a bit of a small portion for an appetizer, I wouldn't split it between more than 2 people. 

I ordered the Novia Scotia Benedict, and bf ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu. The portions are HUGE as everyone has mentioned. Each of us only hate half of our meal. Everything was very good, no complaints except that I didn't care for the home fries. They weren't bad, just not my style. 

The stand out, oddly, was the bread served with my meal. It tasted like it was fresh from a home bread machine, served warm with butter. I wish I had a whole loaf of it! 

Service was excellent. Prices are reasonable - entrees are on the pricier side, but not terrible. Two meals + an app was around $40 (we drank water). 

Would go back :)"}
{"text":"Overall Impression: 4.5
Home-style cooking with generous portions that has something for everyone in the family.

The Food:
Let me tell you about the specials board, because it's where it's at! The restaurant is owned by Greek family who specializes in Mediterranean and Greek dishes, and there is definitely plentiful options when it comes to that cuisine. I ordered a classic from the specials board when I was there--a stuffed pepper with mashed potatoes; one of the ultimate comfort foods and one of my favorites as a child. It did not disappoint! Not only was it huge, but it was covered in a delicious tomato sauce and cooked perfectly. There's nothing like a fountain of stuffed pepper sauce spilling over into a mountain of creamy mashed potatoes. I couldn't even finish the whole thing--I took half home for my boyfriend to eat, and he enjoyed it just as much as I did. I've also enjoyed their Buffalo Chicken Salad, which was HUGE and definitely hit my buffalo chicken cravings at the core.

The Restaurant:
On our last visit we sat outside in the middle of winter. How? They have huge enclosed heaters in the middle of each outdoor section that really do have the feeling of a fireplace. The inside of the restaurant is generally very noisy, as they usually have big parties and families (kids screaming combined with older people hard of hearing), but as long as you don't mind that, everything else is fine. I know in the past they failed a health inspection, but they're clean on the floor. There is always a wait on the weekends because of their popularity, and that attests to their focus on a quality home-cooked meal. Finding a parking spot is difficult because of how many people go there. The servers are friendly and very on their toes due to their volume of customers and are very quick to grab anything you need. Their owners are hands-on and are all over the place when I'm there, attending to everyone's tables and asking everyone if their enjoying their experience.


TL;DR
If you had a bad day and need some amazing comfort food in your life or want a huge meal for a reasonable price, this is the place to go. Their diverse menu that pairs classical home-cooked meals with Greek flare has everyone west of Pittsburgh coming to eat there, and you should too."}
{"text":"Great food, and a huge selection to choose from. Best french onion soup I've had!  Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Had the chicken parm sandwich with fries. The chicken was a good size and the breading was good on it but the chicken was literally squeaky when i chewed into it. It was certainly a bad pick off the menu. The fries didn't even taste like potatoes,  they just tasted like grease. Tried the pancakes and they were by far a better choice ,nice and fluffy. The staff was super and very attentive. Really loud atmosphere but then again it was packed. Won't go out of my way to eat here ever. Pretty pricey for the quality I think but that's always relative to each person."}
{"text":"This place definitely has everything I would expect in a diner: quick seating, service, and no nonsense. Decent coffee and an extra benefit of cocktails and wine, if that's what you're into. 

Where I suppose I was disappointed was the food. The portions were REALLY generous, but the foodie in me wanted something that put a spin on an old concept. 

I ordered the eggs Benedict. Did I ever mention that I LOVE eggs Benedict? If not, then here it is. The English muffin was bland, the ham was eh, and the eggs were PERFECT. 1/3. Here's where it all crashed to hell-the cheap hollandaise sauce...the CUP of cheap hollandaise sauce that drenched the eggs. It was so much, I was gently scraping it off the eggs to save that poached pocket of goodness. 

All else was standard diner quality, I suppose-home fries, bacon, my husband's pancakes...

I will go back for another meal, I think, just to give their creations a try. Maybe the specialties are what keeps this place kicking."}
{"text":"Also, I still love this place, but I always pick up a strange odor on my clothes and in my hair after eating here. It's so strong, I sometimes have to take a shower after coming home from Central Diner. Why? What is it? This is my only complaint other than the lack of paper towels in the bathroom!"}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh for work...

My wife had the moussaka which came with a house salad. The salad alone was huge with tons of fresh feta, Greek olives and an amazing house dressing.

I went with the Greek Benedict. Awesome.

Guarantee...You won't go home hungry! And good luck trying to finish your meal with one of their incredible deserts...we took some back to the hotel for a late night calorie binge."}
{"text":"I ate here with my friend before going to a movie, absolutely delicious, I had mashed potatoes, stuffed green peppers and a cup of chicken noodle soup, homemade and around 10 bucks.  I am ordering takeout tonight.   Believe me I am a very good, homemade and picky cook myself so this was a gold mine for me, when I just want to chill and let some else cook."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to stop in here last minute on our way home from running a few errands. We were so happy with the choice we made by stopping in here. We've never been here before. The food was amazing. The soups,homemade. The chicken meals we both got were huge and delicious. Our server (Kevin) was spectacular and the owner was super nice too."}
{"text":"We come here often. Normally great service, good food, and huge portions.  They have a lot of Greek dishes which I appreciate as that is my heritage. They also hit the mark with traditional dishes too. My favorites are the fried shrimp parmigiana, hot turkey sandwich, and their Greek lemon soup is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Great food and so much of it! Every time we have gone we have brought, at least, half home. Menu includes full bar drinks, all day breakfast, sandwiches, and full entrees, speciality Greek foods, and amazing deserts!We have had the hamburgers, veggie burgers, tuna melts, crab cakes, Greek salads, swordfish, and steaks. We have never been disappointed. Even though we never can find room for dessert, we get some to go! The carrot cake is amazing!! All the cakes are 4 layers of magic! 
They are very popular and it shows. There always are a lot of people there. But don't distress, there is ample seating! Lots of tables and booths in the main room plus seating at the bar and some quieter booths along with them. We have only had to wait for a table once. That was prime time Saturday at 7pm. The wait was still worth it. 
Don't forget to look at the long chalk board for daily specials before you are seated!"}
