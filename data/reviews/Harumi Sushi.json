{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had!!! 
The Oh My God Sushi is amazing!!! OMG!! 
The philadelphia roll was awesome too!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from California and after seeing other reviews and pictures I decided to try this place. The service and food was AMAZING! There were 3 people in my party and we were pretty hungry after traveling all day so we ordered quite a bit of food at first and our waitress asked if we were pretty hungry and even though I said very hungry, she suggested that we wait on a couple of the rolls we originally ordered because their rolls were quite large. She was right! We had the perfect amount of food and left very full and happy! Their prices are very reasonable, the food was quick and the staff was very friendly. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is great, but it's first  come first served, and you're all packed into a real small area by the door and very much in the way. This would be much more efficient if the hostess took names!! I really don't know why they don't. Extremely efficient once you're seated, I'd say we waited maybe two minutes after we ordered to receive our soup and edamame, then the rest of the order just rolled on out. The food was very good!
Oh, worth noting, the bathroom is in a strange location, check it out."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I have ever had in Phoenix!  The quality of their fish, menu variety, and prices are unbeatable!  My bf brought me here after reading some yelp reviews but I was extremely skeptical.  After moving from LA about 3 years ago, I have not been able to find a good sushi spot in Phoenix.  Ive tried so many places guided by yelp, but was always disappointed.  Luckily, we stumbled upon this gem!  Everyone was so friendly and the service was amazing! I work in the restaurant industry, so I am definitely a critic when it comes to good service.  The owner, Juno, was so personable and genuine, he really made our night special  The staff was accommodating and knowledgeable about the food.  This was certainly the cherry on our evening.  They use purple sushi rice for their rolls and nigiri, which is much healthier than plain white sushi rice.  I was a little hesitant when I saw the purple rice, but it was delicious!!! My bf earned many brownie points for finding Harumi.  They also have a location in Scottsdale called Kodo Sushi that we will definitely be trying. Must try this place!! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"We came here a few days ago and I woke up this morning dreaming about the sushi here. So we came back tonight. It's hard to explain or understand how a hole in the wall in downtown Phoenix that uses purple rice (really black rice) can beat the pants off Sushi of Gari in New York.
We ate salmon sashimi (8 pieces for $12), tuna, yellowtail, eel and scallop sushi with fresh wasabi (about $5.50 for two pieces) and an Ahi tower. The sushi was fresh, fresh, fresh. The owner Juno visited our table and brought us Mochi ice cream for dessert. Dinner for two was $100. A similar meal at Sushi of Gari cost me more than three times the price. They don't take reservations so we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Not a sushi guy at all but this was pretty good.  Service was great and portions were very fair definitely will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the OMG  roll, its absolutely delicious. The rolls here are extremely tasty and fresh and the staff is very friendly. The chef will occasionally treat you to complimentary items,  which is always nice. I stop by at least once a week to satisfy my sushi cravings."}
{"text":"Don't get why this place is so popular, when my husband and I went the fish didn't taste fresh at all. The crab was clearly imitation, and just clearly poor quality. I appreciated the inventiveness of the rolls, I liked that, but you fresh great quality fish doesn't taste fishy. This unfortunately did. Staff were nice and attentive, great people but the food just wasn't good sadly."}
{"text":"Let the chefs surprise you. Let them know your favorite fishes and how much you like to spend. Freshness of the fishes, the art in presentation, will just make you want more and come back again :) 
Former orchestra member, the chef with more than 10 years experience was trained under iron chef Masaharu Morimoto. The skill, passion for art and perfection  are demonstrated clearly in their dishes. Try it and you'll love it :)"}
{"text":"Very generous portions. Especially loved the black rice. Excellent service and very quick food. I would recommend it to anyone in Phoenix who likes sushi."}
{"text":"We went to Harumi sushi yesterday (just 4 min walk from Hyatt hotel) looking for dinner.

When we arrived we were warmly greeted and were immediately assigned a table. 

Looking at the menu I noticed the wide selection of sashimi, nigiri and rolls.

I decided to try the OMG roll and the rainbow roll. The food arrived almost straight away and the OMG roll was brought by chef Juno. It was in tinfoil and on fire. The tinfoil was then removed to put out the fire. 

The OMG roll tasted delicious combining the sweetness of the eel, sharpness if the fish, and softness of the avocado. The rainbow roll also tasted delicious. 

We were also given free miso and edamame after logging in via Yelp! 

Following that, we ordered the tempura shrimp roll that was nice and crispy on the inside. 

We were then seen on our way out by Juno the chef and owner who was very kind!

I went back the next day for lunch and was again immensely satisfied. 

I went for the Crazy roll with 6 pieces of nigiri. All amazingly fresh and the crazy roll was gorgeously soft. Juno then have us a free dish of seared tuna tataki. I then ordered the finding nemo roll which had a lovely crunch to it. 

I was in Japan this April and this may be compared to the sushi I had in Japan! Brilliant food, lovely staff and a great location. I wish I was spending more than 2 days in Arizona.

Stunning!"}
{"text":"Really, REALLY??!?!?!?! The positive reviews are mind boggling...Sweet Jesus, come on you goddamn yelptards! This is proof positive that 99% of you wouldn't know good food if it bit you in the ass. As far as sushi in Phoenix is concerned, this is bottom of the barrel stuff. Sub-par, mushy, vinegary, rice (which should be the star) and the overly fishy fish is a no go. For sashimi, stay away! This is the only place I have ever spit out the hamachi sashimi. Garbage! The owner is definitely a good guy, no argument there, but that does not make up for crap food. If you are looking for top tier sushi/sashimi, do yourself a favor and hit up Hana, Roka Akor, Nobuo at Teeter House, Yasu, or even Hiro. If you are downtown and starving for sushi, hit up Moira. Moira is not the best around, but it is  leagues beyond this place! You can thank me later."}
{"text":"We went to Harumi Sushi early on a Tuesday evening and were greeted and seated immediately by a very friendly staff. I heard about this place through Yelp and decided to try as many of the recommended special rolls we could fit in our bellies. In the end we had the oasis, Harumi, rainbow, H3 (spicy), and Oh My God rolls, and they were ALL fantastic and unique! My girlfriend said we should just live in this place and eat here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The chef (Juno, which I'm sure I'm not spelling correctly) sent over dessert of green tea ice cream, something I never would think to try on my own but now crave, along with strawberry ice cream in a mango slice flower arrangement, again amazingly delicious.

Being from San Diego we were hesitant to try sushi in a desert place like Phoenix, but we finally gave in to our craving and we're so glad we did! If there was any way to give more stars we would, like 6 out of 5, but for now we can only count the days to our next trip downtown."}
{"text":"Harumi was so good I had to create a yelp account because they deserve a great review! I found it randomly while on vacation here and will definitely go back the next time we are in town. The spicy tuna was so fresh and the purple rice was great! The service was great as well - they were nice enough to help us so we did not over order (which we often do!) I highly suggest Harumi!!"}
{"text":"The sushi at Harumi is fantastic! Fresh and delicious. The restaurant is small, chaotic, and usually kind of warm inside, but the service is fast and the sushi is the best. Harumi doesn't try to be fancy. They deliver a good quality product at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town and the experience is like no other. My boyfriend and I live in Scottsdale and go to Phoenix just for Harumi! Definitely worth a try if you haven't been!"}
{"text":"The sushi was fresh and very good.  It even smelled good when you walked in unlike some sushi places.  Service was extraordinary.  Our waitress recommended Over the Rainbow roll which was excellent with just the right spiciness.  Will definitely come back if in the area again"}
{"text":"Found this little sushi spot last week. Wonderful, fresh sushi, fantastic service and great prices. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! The fish was really fresh and the rolls were huge!! We ordered 5 rolls and they are all amazing!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi!!!!  You can't go wrong!  The black rice is a wonderful touch to the sushi and the artistry that the chef creates with his sushi is as fantastic as it tastes. Wow!  Definitely going back the next time I'm in Phoenix. You must try it."}
{"text":"If you like sushi do yourself a favor and check this place out.  Comfortable environment, excellent service, and some of the best rolls I've had in PHX.

We stopped in on a Friday night after a friend's recommendation.  He also recommended the Oh My God roll, which we ordered.  The name, though a little goofy, was fitting.  Our friend also recommended that, if given the chance, we chat with the owner, Juno.  It was a slow night so rather than pick from the menu we asked our waiter if it would be possible for Juno to make us three rolls of his choice.  She seemed stunned by the request but asked him and he obliged.  Next came three rolls that weren't on the menu but definitely should be - each excellent.  Juno came over and chatted with us for a while after that and his stories, energy, passion for sushi, and genuine kindness was the perfect ending to the perfect meal.

With restaurants in NYC and Arkansas, Juno next wants to open a second, larger place in Phoenix - possibly Scottsdale or Arcadia - with live entertainment in the way of taiko drums.  Hopefully that will happen soon.  We need more places, and people, like this in town."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path and tucked amid business building downtown we'd heard this place was not to be missed.. They were not mistaken!! We all agreed the sushi was some of the BEST we have had. The service was great, the atmosphere was fun! I would recommend the OMG roll, and if you're feeling adventurous the chef's choice. We are already craving their top quality sushi and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly impressed with this downtown sushi restaurant. Small and quaint but very cool vibe. Good date restaurant. They use black rice in their rolls (as opposed to white rice) because it is a super food that is supposedly an antioxidant. I LOVED the \"Oh My God\" roll. The service was good, but not great. Sort of the typical Asian restaurant where the server isn't excessively friendly but just gets down to business. Check this place out if you are downtown"}
{"text":"Too much hype. It is more like korean style sushi. Not authentic enough.
Ramen is spicy prepared from Korean instant noodle.
Their sushi H3 and Nigiri are too overpowering lack of subtle taste of fine sushi."}
{"text":"Great sushi, very simple which is what I like. The chef will come talk to you at your table...kinda sells you on the place because there isn't much atmosphere, which is unnecessary because the fish is so fresh tasting. Sold me! Also it's cheap as far as sushi is concerned. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The best place for sushi and great staff!! Everyone there has a smile on their face and no matter how horrible you say was...you can count on them making you smile. The owner was a sweetheart and the food was delish!"}
{"text":"OK Phoenix. I know you don't know what you don't know, but let's set a higher bar with Sushi. Here's my experience. Edamame was over cooked. That's really hard to do, but they did it. My waitress was new but didn't know whether the eel was heated, didn't know whether they had amaebi (which they didn't), and wasn't sure they made a hand roll. And hand rolls weren't even offered as an option in the menu. Hello. 

And finally, the spider roll was OK, but should have come out warm. 

And now finally, roll options were limited. Cream cheese should be offered on the Philly roll. They have cream cheese and spicy mayo as an add to all but 2 rolls. That hides bad fish. Come on now."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!  I am not from this area and found this place on yelp. Everything that I read was accurate. Purple rice. Delicious oh my God roll. Etc... But no one mentioned that huge plates of sashimi for 12 bucks!  Delicious huge healthy chunks offered with a very rarely found fresh cut wasabi.  I was in Phoenix for one week I came here twice and ordered enough food that it covered four meals. Strongly recommended from a big sushi connoisseur. 

Week of 6/12/17:
So I've reached a new low.  I had to come back to Phoenix on business...and this time  I chose my hotel location SPECIFICALLY so I could walk to Harumi every night.  Nothing has changed....just as delicious as before...5 nights of sushi in a row and I think I'm ready to float home!  See you in a few months!"}
{"text":"good sushi in downtown....living in downtown over the past 15 years it almost sounded too good to be true to not have to drive to get decent sushi.  We have ordered carry out 2 times now and have yet to be disappointed. prices are very good and the size of the rolls are very impressive.  they also threw in an additional roll FOR free to occupy the empty space on our to go tray.  you cant go wrong with any roll.  And the stuffed peppers are amazing.  

What is better than the food...the service.  fast and friendly.  the people are wonderful.  this will for sure become a weekly dining spot."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in Phoenix. Yes, I know I've said that about other establishments before... but that was before Harumi. 

After a second visit last night we were blown away by how wonderful this place is. Last night we again got the 5 nigiri, 6 sashimi, and we asked if we could substitute the oasis roll in favor of the crazy roll, which they did without hesitation. The crazy roll is crazy good and the fish is the perfect combination tucked into the yummy and unique purple rice. The rolls are just bite site, not those giant ones that make you look like a chipmunk trying not to choke. We also started with the jalapeno poppers, which were light, fresh, not overpowered with cream cheese, and just the right amount of spicy. Will definitely order these again. The last visit we had the crispy stuffed shrimp to start which were amazing- so I think I just have to order both and have leftovers. 

Now the fish... the fish is ridiculously fresh and the highest quality. The lines of fat in the salmon and the melt in your mouth as your eyes roll back in your head... yes, I get that I am talking about food. But this is an experience in joy. I wanted to bow a thousand times over to the chef on the way out. Thank you, thank you for coming to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try out, we should have came earlier. Excellent sushi, creative rolls, beautiful serving, super Japanese service. FIVE stars. Worth the drive from Chandler."}
{"text":"I came here for a business trip and decided to try them out cuz of all the positive yelp reviews.  Ordered the H3 and Crazy rolls. Mmmm...good! Won't hesitate to come here again next time I'm in Phoenix. The only down side here is parking since they're in downtown."}
{"text":"Great service. Really tasty food. I got vegetarian stuff (avocado rolls, veg tempura, edamame), all great. Colleague got a mix of 3 fancy rolls and cleaned her plate. Highly recommend - greatly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Nice 5 pc nigiri and crazy roll. Fresh wasabi on the nigiri was a nice kick. Try the black rice, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"The chirashi was ok; fish was fairly fresh and service was fast. Not incredible. Misu tasted instant instead of home made. Plum wine was delicious. Calamari was over cooked but hand batterrd.Not sold on this place as a favorite but worth it if I'm the area and looking for something to eat."}
{"text":"H3 roll was super tasty and filling. I can usually eat a lot more, this one roll did the job.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place EVERRR! Everything about this place was good: customer service, food, price! So friendly, fast and DELISH! Purple rice is novel- and the chef personally thanked us as we left!"}
{"text":"Its super tasty and our go to place,we keep trying other sushi places and this one is what we use to scale the other ones by!!
Purple rice is one of the many things that makes this place stand out, honestly the Oh My God roll is just as fun the order the first time as it is the 4th or 5th time! We may be in the desert, but this is the best sushi you can get in this sand oasis"}
{"text":"Been here many times and it seems to get better each time. Love that they use the purple rice, which is supposedly healthier for you.  A little pricey but worth it.  I've never had a bad roll and they have a lot of unique ones."}
{"text":"im a picky sushi eater. im also a stickler for good service. if you get 20% from me, you have officially not provided good service. that said, this place is AWESOME!!! food was great, atmosphere was great, people very nice! the head chef, whom i think is also the owner, is awesome! great dining experience. 

large bald white guy with pretty asian girl in coat."}
{"text":"Delicious black rice, real wasabi, h3 and oh my god roll. They even seared my salmon sashimi upon request.  One of the best sushi restaurants I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Found this little gem flying solo on a business trip. They have tables for two lined up against the sushi bar. No one faces the bar which is odd. The staff is friendly and extremely accommodating. Enjoyed the crunchy mango roll and Orion draft. Left off one star for the weird seating arrangement."}
{"text":"I was visiting Pheonix and stopped by the restaurant based on the yelp review. I am glad I did! All the rolls were really good. My favorites were smoked salmon, oh my god (I highly recommend it!), and H3."}
{"text":"We keep coming back to this place for our date night. Best sushi place in town. High Quality food, excellent service."}
{"text":"Amazing. This has become my fav sushi in the valley. The fish quality is second to none and the rolls are well prepared. Add to that the fact that the owner is so accomidating (six buck bottles of top shelf sake, free miso and edamame, as well as other freebees) make this place a must go to. The decor leaves a bit to be desited, but with prices and quality this good, who cares?"}
{"text":"The sushi was ok and was really quick for take out but the cashier was so sullen!"}
{"text":"We were in town on business and staying at a nearby hotel.  Decided to search Yelp for something nearby that sounded good and where I could find something low carb.  I decided on the oasis roll/sashimi combo and hubby had the crab mania roll and gyoza.  We both really enjoyed our dishes and we're happy we tried this place out!  It was excellent!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars.  The food was beyond expectations. Delishious combinations, my favorite being the crunchy mango. The spicyness of the tuna and the sweet freshness of the mango is delightful. Miso soup has a fullness to it, high quality and full bodied flavor with significant chunks of tofu. Nothing was cheaply made, obvious that the chef Juno puts care and seriousness into the food. He personally stopped by our table along with other employees...making sure we were satisfied-no doubt we were!! Mitsuko was so sweet and very attentive.This is going to be my standard sushi spot. I may ask my wife to fly more often just so I can eat here after taking her to the airport."}
{"text":"This place is walking distance to my office so if you are driving it may be difficult to find parking.  I had the H3 sushi, edamame, and miso soup.  Total came out to $18.  The sushi was good and fresh.  It took a while to get the soup and edamame but overall it was a pleasant trip.  Wish they had better lunch sushi deals but the price is expected for quality sushi downtown."}
{"text":"Sushi was great!!! It's a healthier alternative to regular sushi because of the purple rice! 2 of our rolls were rice free with a wonderful blend of flavors!!! Jalapeño appetizer was delish! We will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Food is great, but was turned away when i arrived 15 minutes before closing. Wished that at least the offer of something quick to go would have been given. Maybe im just too much into customer service but my thought is you close when you close and not before."}
{"text":"I have eaten at every sushi place I can find in Phoenix and Harumi is hands down the BEST sushi in Phoenix. The fish quality is amazing and the staff and service is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is legit - pretty serious sushi for a land-locked city. The fish is crazy fresh and the service is awesome. It is a great lunch spot or casual dinner. I highly recommend ordering the fresh wasabi...mind blown!"}
{"text":"Simply the very best Sushi in Phoenix!  Nothing else to say just try it.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"Excellent downtown lunch spot. I've haven't tried their sushi, but the bento boxes are great, I especially like the teriyaki chicken. Service is great and the chef gives large portions. Today they had tempura sweet potatoes, delish! Hands down best Japanese food downtown!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I was eager to try it after reading all the great reviews and people were right on.  I had everything from salmon sashimi to spicy tuna rolls to a scallop roll and it was all delicious.  They use a black rice which looks purple but tastes delicious.  I highly recommend if you're in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Looking for a sushi place in downtown Phoenix and came across this restaurant.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the omakase.  Surprisingly it was only $35 so I was a little skeptical as you can imagine.  At most legit sushi places this can be well into the triple digits.  This is not one of those types of places unfortunately but still a good money's worth.  

The sushi is served with purple rice.  I find that interesting since it is supposedly healthier than regular white sushi rice.  It tasted just as good.  The portions of fish were pretty substantial. The omakase even came with Toro.  But I wonder whether this was real because it was such a big piece.  We also order a spicy tuna roll which turned out to be pretty good.  The squid on the dish was a bit chewy and I did not care for it.  But everything else was delightful.  For phoenix, it was a good experience being that there is really no water nearby for fresh sushi."}
{"text":"First thing we noticed is the service in this quaint establishment, great! The next thing we noticed was the menu... Not so hot ! It had a short list of very basic sushi and a mixture of specialty rolls.... At this point the very nice young lady had brought us water and was taking drink orders. We ordered the old faithful spider roll just to be objective ( to be honest we were in a mood for certain things we usually eat at sushi places that this menu just didn't have ) . One of the servers gave us some free soup, the roll arrived in good time and the flavor was adequate ( not the best but certainly not the worst ) . Over all experience not so pricey, very friendly but for the more experienced sushi goer you might want something more?  !"}
{"text":"I agree with all the 5 star reviews but can't give the full 5. They have room for improvement even within the market position they occupy. We see a lot of restaurants that have upscale ambiance and deliver mediocre food. This place is the opposite. Diner style ambiance with exceptional food. But it's not the ambiance that dropped the star. When the food is this good who cares? No, it was the service. Consistent exceptional service over time would make it so you couldn't get a seat at this place. There is no excuse for weak service because it will all come back to you. I've been here three times now over the last 4 months. The owner chef is incredible. Ask for his omakase. You won't regret it. Excellent price for exceptional sushi. Just be prepared for average service."}
{"text":"Warily one of the sushi spots in Phoenix. Highly recommend the tuna tower and the oh my god roll. Quick service, pleasant folks. And quite clean. Bring your friends and have a great sushi night :)"}
{"text":"Very good sushi place in Phoenix.

fresh fish and very polite waiters/waitresses. ..."}
{"text":"Not the cheapest sushi place out there and happy hour doesn't have much options, but the food quality definitely beats most other sushi place around. Service is also great and the environment is super clean."}
{"text":"First off. I'm from the ocean so I know good sushi. Lol. Don't you just love reviews that have I'm from (insert city) so I know good (insert food)!!  Anyhow. This place is awesome. Great sushi, great service. And the OMG roll is all that!!  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi connoisseur, and can confidently say that this place gets 5 stars for the quality and taste of its sushi. Small location but worth visiting if in the area. It's definitely a no-brainier decision if you are looking for great sushi (and I'm comparing this to some great sushi places on the east and west coast)!"}
{"text":"I used to love going here for lunch. It is a small little restaurant that served this great lunch bent box. It came with rice, really tasty chicken, veggies, a little side salad and 2 pieces of tempura. Used to go 3-4 times a month and then they changed it. Now they only serve sushi. I am not a fan of sushi and have not gone back since they changed their menu. It is always packed so the sushi must be good"}
{"text":"High Quality.  Fair Prices.  Nice Lighting.  Great Presentation.  Waited over an hour for our food to arrive.  Gave us 50% off."}
{"text":"Wow\" that's what I have to say about this place. The service was fantastic. They were so helpful and informative. The staff made us feel like if we were regulars because they were so warm and inviting. The waitress helped us with our order because it was our first time there. The food was so good. It was fresh and seasoned perfectly. Proportions are great, the prices are great, and the atmosphere is great. We are definitely going to be coming back here soon."}
{"text":"Keeping it simple. The OMG roll is amazing. The service is great! It's a hidden gem in downtown Phoenix. Highly recommended (and we are sushi snobs)"}
{"text":"Alright.  This place is every bit as good as people are saying it is.  Just finished my \"to go\" box back at the office and I thoroughly enjoyed it, which is a rare occurrence with sushi.  It was fresh, tasty and very appealing.  I'll be going back soon to dine in and sample a few more of their offerings.  In the mean time, get your butts to downtown Phoenix and check it out.  Pretty sure you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I been to many sushi places before but never get the taste like Harumi Sushi. After having sushi from here and purple rice, I don't feel like eating sushi with white rice. This place, OMG not only the taste of their sushi and fresh salmon, tuna, yellow tail and many more are great but also the sushi chef and their server are so friendly. I have a great experience there. I don't understand why there are people who give them a couple star, sometime as a customer, we have to understand that there are time that we have to wait forever if they are so busy every restaurant we go. We are not the only one who wait for it, there are people ahead of us. So I really recommend this place. Unfortunately, if you don't have a good experience, then try it again. You will have a good time. LOVE This place........"}
{"text":"Pretty good Sushi!
Lunch time is very hectic so it might be best to call ahead for take out and not dine in!
Lunch Specials are great value. They use purple rice and it is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Sushi ive had. Food is fresh and well made, friendly owner, cute waitresses.. What more can you ask for. :) kidding aside, this place is amazing, give it a try."}
{"text":"Bomb sauce. Found this jem while walkin downtown. Chef Juno is a master and super  friendly. I will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Harumi has some of the best Sushi I have ever eaten. I would even consider it to be world class. We ordered the Harumi Roll and the Oh My God roll, and both were prime. Halfway through our meal, the lead chef \"Chef Sexy,\" asked us if we were still hungry and wanted a sample. It was a salmon dish I can't quite remember but it was amazing, and on the house! If you're looking for authentic five star sushi and six star service, Harumi is the place to go. Perfect for date night!"}
{"text":"Quick and great service, almost like they knew what I needed and wanted right off the bat. Amazing rolls, their OMG roll, finding Nemo and crab mania rolls are fantastic. No imitation crab, and they have this rice that's quite unique it's PURPLE! But it's a nice addition to their identity. All around I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Love love love it! The atmosphere is laid back. The sushi is bombay! And the service was great! We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots! Delicious food, friendly staff, and a relaxed atmosphere are just a few of the things that keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Best sushi dinner I've had in a while. Came in with a party of three and we were sat promptly. Rolls came out fast and OH MY GOSH were they on point. Our server as well as the gal who set our food were very sweet and friendly. First place I'll think of on sushi night. Thank you Harumi! We will definitely be back with more friends!"}
{"text":"After I've been here around 20 times here are the patterns I have observed:
1. Their food never disappoint. I tend to stick with the basic nigiri, sashimi and oasis rolls. But they also require the most in terms of the quality of the fish. With that being said you will not disappoint if you look for quality fish here.
2. The service staff tries but can get overwhelmed. They are welcoming people tries to attend to your needs. But on weekend night when crowds get crazy they can miss a thing or two. Beside some waiting (you won't hear them call your number if you are outside so be careful about that), you might also won't receive a thing or two on your order. For example for the TWO CONSECUTIVE TIMES we were there on weekend nights, we didn't get the miso soup we ordered and still get them on the check. When we went on weekdays that never happened and miso soup almost always was the first thing to arrive. With that being said going on a weekday would be a much better bet. If you are determined to go on weekends plan your time accordingly and pay attention to the check to make sure you don't get charged on things you don't receive.
3. The owner is entertaining so you don't need to be shy about joking with him ;)"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best sushi place in town! That's why they have a line out the door on the weekends. Prices are so responsible, and they don't skimp on the size of the rolls or the quality of fish. You must try the Oh My God Roll.. That is what you will be saying the entire time you eat it.. so good. The owner and staff are on it.. quickest roll making and they get to know you and remember you. They once in awhile will give you a free roll just in appreciation for being a customer. The owner Juno will once in a while walk over and give free complementary sushi samples to the people waiting. FYI- They do take reservations"}
{"text":"Went here the Saturday before Super Bowl and they were slammed but still did pretty good. The sushi is the best I've had in the Phoenix area. It's good food and they don't take advantage of your wallet because of it."}
{"text":"Definitely The best Japanese restaurant in Phoenix. Will come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't stop gushing today after going to this place. I ordered the Las Vegas roll and Sex in the City roll. The Las Vegas roll is hands-down the most amazing thing I have ever tried and the Sex in the City roll was pretty good, too. They had a variety of rolls for all kinds of tastes and also you can make your own bento box. Everyone should definitely check this place out if you live in Downtown Phoenix! (:"}
{"text":"Harumi Sushi is by far my favorite Sushi restaurant in Phoenix or Tucson! They do an incredible job! I'm can be squeamish when it comes to raw fish, but have NEVER been disappointed here, and I've been to Harumi a lot! The staff is friendly, the restaurant is clean, and the \"purple rice\" is insanely good for you! It also doesn't taste much different than white rice, in case you were wondering. Thank you Harumi for taking care of my sushi cravings! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The plainness of the restaurant is in stark contrast to the exquisitely tasty, beautiful, and fresh fish. I had omekase (chef's choice), which included an Oasis roll (cucumber, rather than rice, wrapped it), tuna, salmon, yellowtail, a mixed roll (with purple/black rice (nutty tasting)... The plate was artfully presented and included wasabi shaped like a jalapeno with a real jalapeno stem. Many of the fish were topped with fresh wasabi. The salmon was melt-in-the mouth wonderful.

Sometimes the rolls were too big to pop in the mouth without (as one writer posted) looking like a chipmunk. I wonder if the chef might consider this - especially for the Oasis roll (delightfully refreshing, but very big).

Parsley, shredded daikon, and lettuces were used as garnishes on the plate. It was nice to have the freshness of the parsley as a contrast to the fish. I also wondered about shiso leaves. --I have yet to see shiso leaves in Arizona. Maybe this place has them. I will have to return to find out. 

I asked for ginger ice cream, and was initially told they had it. A server came and explained they did not, and offered green tea, plum, or vanilla. We selected green tea and plum. Both were overly sweet and lacked flavor. The ice cream was very creamy (not used to Japanese ice cream being so creamy) and had nice texture, but the flavor just wasn't there. Our server kindly took it back. Usually, I am a big fan of green tea, ginger, and red bean ice cream.

A companion did not recommend the bathroom. It is apparently shared by the building tenants. I told the server about this and she kindly said it would be addressed."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly and engaged with customers. The sushi was amazing and was ready 5 minutes after we ordered! We will definitely be returning the next time we are in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix for a very reasonable price.  The owner Juno is awesome, very friendly,  and I love his creations.  Order some sexy tuna or salmon, you won't regret it.  It's also not uncommon for him to give you something free so it definitely makes you feel appreciated as a customer.  Honestly, if you love sushi and haven't been here yet,  you must! !"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here. The fish is so fresh, they really take the time to make sure they are acquiring from quality places. The owner is so sweet, although I believe he is now mostly at the new location. Service is still great, everyone is friendly and ready to get you whatever you may need.

The H3 is our favorite. Sooo many good flavors."}
{"text":"Checked in a while ago on our first visit. I liked this place. Been back 4 more times (I think) since. The chef and staff aim to please with their product and service, which seems hard to come by these days. Hopefully that will hold up as this place gets more popular and inevitably busier. The quality of the fish is top notch. I usually only eat nigiri, sashimi and sometimes maki. I try to avoid the other constructed rolls. The bigger rolls that I have tried are too saucy and/or fried for my taste. It would be nice if they had those \"Americanized\" rolls with other fresh ingredients and were not all fried or covered in some kind of sauce.

A couple of drawbacks... selections are slim from the fish to the adult beverages. There are a few bulk beers (InBev) or sakes (probably InBev too) from which to choose. There aren't any other kind of adult beverages.

The other drawback is that there is no option for white rice. The purple rice (black rice) is novel and lends a sweeter and nuttier flavor to the nigiri, but it can take away from the fish a bit. I would like the option to choose.

Picky are we? Yep.

Arigato gozaimas."}
{"text":"FanTasTic

Came here in a whim and very pleased. I especially love they do fermented rice (purple rice). Excellent service.... so friendly and quick. Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Wow this place was so good! Best sushi I've ever had! And I can't believe it was in Phoenix. I'm definitely skeptical about fresh fish here in Phoenix but this place proved me wrong. Our waitress told us it would be a 45 min wait until we got our food- but it was only a half hour. We were there on a Friday night and they seemed to be understaffed. So we just sat back and had a few beers and relaxed. Go here if you love sushi. But if it's busy, be prepared to wait for your food. It'll be worth it tho!"}
{"text":"Finally!! A sushi restaurant in downtown Phoenix worthy of multiple visits. 

To begin with, the service here is impeccable. Very attentive and always on the ball. After having been in the industry for 10 years, I know first hand that great service can either make or break a dining experience...this merely enhanced the amazing food. 

The Hand rolls are perfect. Spicy Tuna is ACTUALLY SPICY. I also tried the 3H roll which was AWESOME. Perfect texture and the roe added a great little pop. The Oh My God Roll came out in fantastic presentation (everyone loves fire) and had the flavor to boot. 

Last but not least, I felt like I was stealing from this place for the quality of food the price is outstanding. 

All in all I can't find  anything negative about this sushi joint! Do yourself a favor and try it!"}
{"text":"We had gone during comicon about a month ago. The place was really busy and short staffed. Although we didn't make reservations we were seated right away however it took about 35 mins to be waited on. The table we were seated on was rickety and would tilt back and forth. When we asked to move to the next one we were told very rudely to push the tables together and move to the next one because originally that's how they are supposed to be. So there after. .. we ordered drinks which took another 15 mins plus ordering our food.. We could see that we weren't the only ones having bad service. . This was our first time there. 

Service bad; food good but not rolled tightly enough to hold. 
May give it another chance TBD."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying I never write reviews, but I had such a good experience at this restaurant that I had to. My boyfriend and I were in town for the weekend and felt like sushi, and this was close and highly rated. We got there a little early to our reservation and were immediately seated. We ordered a few of the appetizers which were brought out in about five minutes (hot and freshly made, not like they had been sitting there or anything), and our rolls were brought out 5-10 minutes later. The food was great, and Juno (manager or head chef I assumed) was extremely entertaining. He not only sent us over some free samples, but he visited each table to make sure everything was satisfactory. He was cracking jokes the whole time, with the patrons and employees, which I found hilarious and really added to the overall experience. The waitresses were all very attentive and nice as well, each of them coming to check on us more than once. Ultimately, I can see why this place has such a high rating. I highly recommend you try this out if you're craving sushi and a good time, and I wish this place was in Denver :)"}
{"text":"I love sushi!!! I thought that I have eaten the best sushi...but no! I ate the best sushi today at harumi sushi... if you like sushi this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever!!! Ak and Fred love it  I could live here and eat it all day everyday. Ak loves the sex and the city and Fred loves the oasis roll cause it's really fresh!! Yummy bunny!! Yay!!! The sex in the city is mushy!! We like mushy!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Harumi Sushi a few days ago and I absolutely loved it! I thought that the fish was very fresh tasting and though I could have wished for a better sake menu, I couldn't have wished for better service or pricing. They had gluten-free soy sauce on request and for only 20 cents a packet, the service was quite attentive, and the sushi chef came to our table to see how everything was and even how spicy I wanted  my Tuna Martini, (which was actually my favorite dish that I had). Harumi Sushi had excellent service and food, as well as generous portion sizes without the gargantuan prices."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever! Highly recommended~  people are so friendly. I will definitely come back again !"}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently and really enjoyed the sushi. The sushi chef came over twice during our dinner to check on the tables. The waitress wasn't quite as attentive, but that's fine we liked the privacy. The purple rice is Thai rice and much better than white rice. Don't be afraid, it has no odd taste or anything. 

The sushi sampler was great with mixed sashimi, nigiri and a roll. Lots of food, very fresh and good quality. Not too busy on a Friday night surprisingly, wish this place would be busier it's really good!"}
{"text":"every nice place to eat the order wont take the long . they are supper professional"}
{"text":"Decently priced delicious rolls! Had a sea urchin as well and it melted in my mouth.
Very friendly staff!
Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My family 9 of us celebrated Jenny's birthday and Juno  and Yung made the night. Perfect food and atmosphere we will make this a favorite all the way from Missouri! !"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for my 30th birthday dinner. Staff wasn't very inviting but after we finally were acknowledged, seated and got our food.....OMG was it amazing. The black rice was different but it made the sushi so much more amazing. We ordered a ton of food and cleared just about all of it. I will definitely be returning if only for the food."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi place in town. Lunch is different from dinner, they tend to the fast paced lifestyle during lunch, but dinner is a sit down. They use the purple rice instead of the typical white. When I go I always get the Oh MY God! roll... just trust me it is a show and it taste amazing. They do their nigiri right, cut and prepped properly. It is run by Japanese owner not korean like majority of the sushi restaurants in town."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING. I'm so glad I decided to try it on the whim. When I first saw the sushi, it looked suspicious because the chef used a different kind of rice. However, the first bite made it a life changing experience. Seriously. I ordered H3 roll and another one that I can't remember. Both were mouthwatering good! Chef Juno also gave us some free appetizers and free green tea ICE CREAM! 

I have to admit it, the sushi was even better than California's. Now that I am back home, I don't know how I will find another place to satisfy my cravings."}
{"text":"As the awareness of supporting local businesses continues to  grow, Harumi Sushi is one place which will have you thinking twice about ever going to a chain sushi restaurant ever again. Centrally located in downtown Phoenix, it's a leisurely 3 minute stroll from the light rail. Owned and operated by Juno, this hidden gem in the desert offers some of the finest sushi in a comfortable, home-like setting. 

Originally from New York, Juno can be seen actively engaging his customers offering advice and suggestions to insure a great dining experience. His heart warming smile is shared by his staff who seem to be genuinely happy to welcome you into their establishment. 

We were a table of three and were instantly greeted by the hostess and seated promptly. It was 8pm and we decided to order edamame for starters. Reading the menu, the OMG roll caught my eye. My friends suggested we give permission for the chef to choose three additional rolls. Risky? Absolutely, but what an adventure!

Juno created three additional rolls which words can not possibly describe the medley of flavors and artful presentation. Each piece was a well choreographed dance of flavors ranging from the simple to complex. The fresh pickled ginger cleansed and prepared the palette for the ensuing journey. It wasn't until the end that I realized I hadn't even touched my traditional soy sauce with wasabi mixture. It seemed irreverent and unnecessary like steak sauce to a filet mignon. A notable feature of the sushi is no white rice, black rice which turns purple when cooked offers a unique flavor and serves as the perfect foundation allowing the novice to easily lift the sushi with precision. 

September 7th will be the one year anniversary of Harumi Sushi. Juno's dream is to open a 3,500sf restaurant offering the finest sushi accompanied by a piano and Japanese drums. Won't you please join me in helping this dream become a reality. Let's come together as a community and support Juno and his dream. I assure you, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The owner was very rude. I have been to the restaurant several times and I think his name is Juno. My friends and I saw him yell and be very disrespectful to his employees in front of customers. It was very uncomfortable and awkward. He also tends to flirt a lot with some of the female customers...overall the food, prices, and service is average. The experience is typically just ok except for the owner."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary and I couldn't believe how great the sushi was.... In Arizona. The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean and the area was cool. Very nice little spot. We will be back."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for sushi tonight, as usual, and decided to try some place new, as usual. When we walked in there was already a line of people all the way to the door, waiting for a table. The staff was so busy we weren't really acknowledged, and we didn't know if we just wait in line or if we needed to put a name down. We waited about 15min until  it was our turn to get sat. Service started off slow, but it was understandable as the place was packed. Our waitress and the rest of the staff were super nice and did everything with a smile.
Ok now, let's get down to business and talk food! The sushi was amazing. I'm already craving the HA Roll again. That was by far my favorite roll that we tried. It was the perfect combination of sweet spicy and the cucumber crunch to it added a refreshing touch. Other favorites were OMG Roll and Spicy Scallops. All the rolls were served with purple rice opposed to white which was kind of cool and different. We also tried the Stuff Jalapenos which were surprisingly not spicy, but still great!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places I have had sushi at!! It doesn't look like a fancy place but the sushi is amazing!! The OMG roll is exactly the reason for why it's called an OMG roll!! I would definitely come back just to have that roll again!! If you haven't tried it, you NEED to!!!"}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI I'VE EVER HAD!  
My wife and I went here for the first time last night.  I normally don't like sushi, but my wife likes it so I decided to give it another try.  We ordered the \"Oh My God\" roll and the \"Crab Mania\" roll.  The \"Oh My God\" roll lived up to its name.  It was incredible.  They do the final cooking process at your table.  The sushi is wrapped in tinfoil and they pore alchohol over a plate and light it then cook the sushi over it until the alchohol burns off.  It's pretty cool and the result is amazing.  The \"Crab Mania\" was pretty good too.  The people were very nice and the food was terrific.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am in phoenix visiting from out of state and this place by far has the best, most sincere hospitality an establishment can extend toward a customer. Our first step through the door we were acknowledged and quickly seated. Ordering was a cinch as all you had to do was record the quantity of your order on a ticket that doubled as your menu. We ordered the tempura shrimp and tempura vegetables as appetizers. I had the ikura nigiri and the shrimp ramen. Both tempura appetizers were delicious and we loved them. My salmon roe was fresh and the seaweed that wrapped my nigiri was crisp and fresh. For those of you that love spicy soups, the shrimp ramen was yummy. 
If you don't mind the drive into downtown phoenix, Harumi sushi is worth it. You definitely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing. Good service and by far the best sushi I've had in the valley. I got the combo roll and picked Vegas, crazy, and super crunchy roll and they were so fresh and delicious. Their appetizer of super crunchy shrimp was so delicious you won't regret trying it :) 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here while traveling for work. I did a pick up order which was ready quickly. The food was very good, reasonably prices, and the staff were friendly. I reccomended this place to some of my coworkers who picked up food the next day. They also had a great experience."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi spot in AZ. Hands down. Best quality and awesome service. Always excited for a Harumi night out."}
{"text":"Best rolls i've had in a while and very good at the price. The staff is very kind and they bring you the meal very fast. Definetly i'll be back."}
{"text":"We came here the other night and got several different rolls accompanied by a platter of various items. Somewhere in the mix came the Oh My God roll and it was delicious! The service was good and the nightly atmosphere was enjoyable with a cinematic view. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi that we've had in Phoenix so far but we are new to the area. Our daughter is a fan of several specialty rolls."}
{"text":"Place is legit. OMG roll is the best & H3 are great. Nonpretentious and they get it. Wish they were open every day"}
{"text":"Another sushi place to add on my list!   Service was great (water was always filled and food came out at reasonable timing), everything tasted fresh, non greasy, and light.  I love the fact of having clear pickled ginger rather than that red food coloring crap with my sushi.   Pretty reseasonable prices.... there were 7 of us and we ended up spending $150.  And for it being located right in downtown Phx, finding parking around the area wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, excellent service. Never thought sushi would be this good in the middle of the desert. The restaurant only uses the freshest fish and uses purple rice in all it's rolls (a good thing)."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. Highly recommended! The staff were very kind and helpful. By far the best Yellowtail I've had in Phoenix. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I was skeptical of trying a sushi place in Phoenix, but I'm am so glad I tried Harumi. 

The waitstaff and chefs were actually Japanese and I could speak Japanese with them but they were personable and funny with the rest of my group. 

The sushi itself was delicious. It was fresher fish than I ever could have imagined getting in Phoenix. 

Besides the standard classic sushi basics, which were all very well made, the chef also brought us some seared modern takes to try as well. 

All in all, it was an amazing meal and the sushi was better than most places in good west coast. If you enjoy sushi I can't imagine you'd be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place uses forbidden rice. The chef is extremely nice. Seared salmon is to die for and spicy tuna rolls are the best buck for your money. We visit Harumi at least once a week. They really care about their sushi, it tastes delicious. Love, love, love it."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi you will ever have! Everything I've had on the menu so far is delicious. Prices are awesome for the size of the portions. Huge portions! Owner is so nice and so friendly. Me and my husband drive out of our way, pay parking downtown and walk however many blocks just to come here! This place ruined other sushi places for us. They use black rice for all their sushi, which is considered a superfood because of all the antioxidants. Delicious and good for you!"}
{"text":"Why is the rice purple? They are slightly over priced. I really really hate the purple rice! And the cubes of cream cheese are a turn off. The rice was also soggy and patsy. Fuck this place I will never ever go back. If I do go back want to get a refund for my $69 worth of sushi. I'm gagging now looking at this nasty ass shit."}
{"text":"I admit I have a bias towards smaller family run businesses, but don't hold that against this restaurant. It really does deserve every star. Personal attention by friendly staff serving wonderful creative and delicious sushi combinations. The smaller unassuming location makes it feel that much more personal. Don't be surprised when the chef comes to your table to check that you are satisfied. Great place. Check it out."}
{"text":"Was just in town for one night, thought sushi would be good since I was alone. Tried the oasis roll, wrapped in cucumber. Hard to stay together, but taste is amazing!!!! Got it with 6 sashimi. Big cuts of fish, delicious!!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious every visit! Never a negative experience. My favorite items on the menu to order: Tuna tataki, veggie tempura, scallop rolls, seaweed salad, asparagus rolls, and the fresh water eel. I also have enjoyed the ice cream in dough balls they have. Every time I visit the sushi chef has given my family and I a free special of the day which has been tasty. Very professional and friendly service."}
{"text":"So some friends of mine had found this place and since it was in DT Phoenix I was happy to make a food discovery outside of my comfortable Scottsdale zone.  The girlfriend is a big sushi fan so definitely couldn't pass this opportunity up.  The staff was very friendly and we were able to get a table there no problem even for a Friday night, but it looked like they had some tables reserved so that explains some things.  

First off we had the shrimp tempura and watch out it's piping hot, but only because it's so fresh!  The first words out of my mouth were, THIS IS THE BEST TEMPURA SHRIMP I\"VE EVER HAD.  I mean i'm no stranger when it comes to tempura shrimp and this appetizer was just so flavorful and crispy and fresh.  To top it off the ponzu sauce had an added kick of spice in it which put it over the top.  The rolls that we got were the H3 roll and the Oh my God roll as well as a spicy salmon roll.  Now right off the bat you know it's different b/c they used some sort of purple rice it seemed like.  I know i've seen this type of rice before, but could not specify the type of rice.  The H3 roll was good and I am unable to go into too much detail due to it being overshadowed by the Oh My God Roll.  So the Oh My God roll is nothing I've ever seen before.  It comes wrapped up in (for what I can see a child crafting a viking helmet out of foil) and there's a plate that's ON FIRE!!!!  Then this viking helmet starts flying!!   OH my GOD! as in... Oh My God it's flying!! or... Oh My GOD there's a Fire...or just OH MY GOD It was sooo darn good!!!!  Our waiter unwraps this foil contraption and there's this awesome roll that has almost a smoky campfire type flavor to it which was just fantastic!  I can't even tell you what was in it, just eat it!!  I will definitely be going back.

Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had in Arizona. Service was great and the food came out fast. The rolls were big and filling. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"QUALITY. 

So glad to find this gem in downtown Phoenix - so friendly, so good, such a great experience. Try it all and keep coming back. SO WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Food: The ingredients here are SOOO fresh. All the sushi is made with Forbidden Rice, which is delicious. Their avacado blows my mind. The shrimp tempura roll is SOOOO good and the blending of flavors is literally like nothing you will experience anywhere else. They are sushi masters here. I would give their sushi (and I've had several rolls) 5 stars for quality, freshness, and taste. Absolutely the very best sushi I have ever had! The ahi tuna tower and HG roll are the bomb!!! The rolls are full of tons of fish and the black rice is super delicious and hard to find!  This is a must try!

Service: Quaint, local and great service! The chefs seem very friendly and happy to be there. The servers were very attentive as well as the chef. He gave everyone a complimentary seared tuna and fried yellow fish tempura. And the service was welcoming with timely checkups throughout dinner. We made a reservation, and were immediately seated upon arrival. No wait for anything from our drinks to getting our starters. The waitress is also awesome. She is so hyped up with energy somehow and pleasantly nice. Very good demeanor even when it's busy and she is scurrying around everywhere.

Atmosphere: This place feels very authentic and friendly to me, a comfortable environment for an excellent meal. Decoration is casual, yet classy, trendy and modern. And yet, one can tell it is at heart a mom and pop operation, with authentic Japanese cuisine. They have tables for two lined up against the sushi bar. No one faces the bar which is odd. And it was pretty busy over lunch hour with most taking food away. Usually the owner waves at you while he's making delicious rolls, and says bye and thanks you for leaving as you walk out. 

The overall experience was fulfilling and I felt very satisfied! Very reasonable prices for such a fantastic dining experience! The staff is so friendly and welcoming. The owner was very nice and friendly. The sushi rolls are creative and delicious. One of the best sushis I have ever tried. The atmosphere is lively. This place is clean, unique, friendly and savory. I cannot wait to come back. It's a great place to go alone or with company. Please go and visit and support our wonderful downtown! I will most definitely be returning to satisfy future cravings! You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"At first I was a little put off because while waiting for a table, multiple waitresses forcefully pushed past us to access the refrigerator of alcohol behind us without excusing themselves.  Luckily the wait was less than five minutes on that Saturday night or else we might have left. 

I'm so glad we stayed! Once seated, the entire staff was very friendly and even seemed excited when taking our order. There were a few birthday parties going on in the restaurant that night. They made them stand up and everyone sang to them.  Normally I'm not a fan of being disturbed when trying to enjoy a meal, but the overflowing enthusiasm shown by everyone who worked there made it a fun experience.

The portion sizes of the food were bigger than I've had at any other sushi restaurant - and it was all very fresh! They use a certain kind of rice that is purple when served. It was definitely different than anything I've seen before. 

They forgot to serve us our edamame, but gladly took it off our bill for us with no problem.

I would absolutely recommend this place and cannot wait to come back on my next trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I have only found two sushi places in Pittsburgh which I consider acceptable, and this is one of them. For starters, these guys really know what they're doing. Yeah they have some American-style rolls that are just deep fried and sauced all to hell (not saying that's not delicious), but they also have a lot of really fresh, interesting menu options, and their sashimi is exquisitely fresh and delicious.

Ooh - they seem to have a reasonably large selection of saki too, so that's nice.

It's not a very large place, and when we stopped by for lunch it was pretty packed, so maybe plan around that - I'm not sure.  But service was fast and everybody was exceptionally friendly - nothing arrogant. I'd definitely stop in again!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in the valley. Fish was so fresh and the rolls were awesome too.  Juno the chef is amazing too!  Best sushi best price you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Quite literally the best hole in the wall ever. Best sushi in Arizona hands down do not be fooled by the interior. Quality of fish is insane here and the pricing would make you think otherwise. My favorite sushi spot in Arizona by far."}
{"text":"The purple rice tastes great! Great lunch specials and even their grab and go sushi is fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time here and it was great! The first thought that came to my mind when I looked at the menu was that the food was slightly more expensive for the same rolls I could get at another sushi restaurant, but it wasn't much of a difference so I didn't care. Then when they brought out the food I realized why, they give you a ton of food and it is delicious. Also the people worked were very cool. One of the chefs even came out started asking everyone how their food was. I would definitely recommend this place and will be going back."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and wanted some good sushi.  We found this place on Yelp and it did not disappoint. It was a very casual place to eat but the sushi was amazing. We got the Omakase (leaving it up to the chef). It was incredible !"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have a new sushi option.  I live 40 miles from here but I would still travel here by bicycle.  The food was delicious and a really good value considering each roll was half the size of my arm.  It was a unique experience as well, from the purple rice to the roll that was set ablaze!  Kind friendly service too."}
{"text":"Thank god Yelp led me to this place cause it absolutely was amazing! The owner as well as the server were both SO friendly, food was fresh and tasty, as well as the cost was great! I adored their purple rice and chilly-shaped wasabi lol I was there for dinner one night and ended up going back for lunch the following day!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love sushi, and wherever else we go we end up comparing it to Harumi. Harumi is always better! The fish is always fresh, the OMG and H3 are delicious, but everything really is! No matter what you order you'll be happy.

The owner and staff are also so friendly and the atmosphere is a lot of fun. If you are in the Phoenix area and you want sushi this is a can't miss!"}
{"text":"Wandered in after a long day of flying. The staff was super friendly, service was fast. The H3 roll and Oh my God roll were delicious. 3 rolls was more than enough for the two of us. Fun, mellow environment in the downtown area. Will definitely stop by the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi I have had in Phoenix so far.  The purple rice is really amazing. My favorite rolls are the Crazy roll and the Rainbow roll.  I've NEVER had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Great food! Great prices!  Fast attentive service!  The sashimi was fresh and probably the best I've had yet. And the Vegas rolls are to die for! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"First visit here and was very impressed with both the sushi and the service.  The sushi chef was extremely attentive.  The Ahi Tower was a real high point of the dinner and definitely a do-again."}
{"text":"OMG the sushi here was sooo good! I love the purple rice that they use and how they don't overload the sushi with rice. Love all the different rolls I got with my group, especially the mango crunch and the OMG rolls! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Good Service and Good Sushi! I am giving this place 4 stars because everything we ordered was fresh and delicious. They use black/purple rice for their rolls which was cool and also they were not too \"ricey\" either so you could really get the flavors.  We liked that the chef came by to ask us how things were, and the dining area is kept very clean, too.  Teriyaki and other hot items were \"Xed\" off the menu so we assumed they were not an option..The restrooms are shared with one or two other businesses so you have to go through the back door and down a sketchy hallway past the fridges and broken deep fryer. But if you can get past that, (or place your order to go and have a beer while you wait), you will have a super delicious meal!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best sushi I have ever had. Chef Paul is truly amazing and always takes care of my order. He remembers what I order and always has it ready for me. Little Chris makes the whole eating experience at Harumi great. He's very friendly and always has a very positive attitude. He is very attentive and always welcomes the friends I bring. He helps those new to sushi by exposing the menu. I would give it 5 stars but can't because when Chef Paul and Little Chris are not there, it's not as good."}
{"text":"My family and I went here Thursday night and had THE BEST experience ever!! Definitely my new fav sushi spot. From the amazing sushi, to the decent price and most importantly the experience the servers gave us! I wish I would have got the gentlemen's name, he had longer hair and was older then the other servers, because he was the SWEETEST to our darling daughter! We had a saki bomb and he randomly came over and brought her a special orange Japanese soda that had a marble in it, just to make her feel special too, and she had such a kick out of that!! I had the California roll and the shrimp tempura roll and my husband tried the chefs special plate where they decide for you what they bring out. Everything was really fresh, a must try!!"}
{"text":"There is a reason this place is 5 stars! The sushi is fresh and delicious. The restaurant has a nice quiet atmosphere.  The selection is great and the price is reasonable.  I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi place! I just wish it was closer to me.  Tried this place after receiving a raving recommendation from a friend and it did not disappoint. Authentic sushi that arrived fast and tasted amazing. Fresh, quality ingredients and really friendly and accommodating service. Chef Juno is a star."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Parking was around/behind building so expected that downtown. The function of the restaurant is odd. Soon as we walked in there was a line. No signs explaining whether or not to seat self. There was a dirty dish cart next to us by front door. Somewhat crowded for small space. 
So apparently you should: 1. Know what you're ordering. Or 2. Walk up in line to register & get a menu to figure out what you want before your turn. 
When we ordered the cashier checked to see if there were rolls prepared in to-go dishes in the display next to her. Odd. I came to eat \"fresh-prepared\" food inside!? 
As u pay the register asks for a tip. To which I asked if they would be delivering our dishes to our table. No they do not. They call your number and u walk up. Why tip? I felt obligated & tipped 10%. 
Self seated in the back. It was that or by hot windows. We were next to the ice machine and makeshift storage closet with curtain. Place was warm. (It is 116* outside so pass on that.)
Two rolls we ordered were great! Did not come with cucumber salad or Miso soup. You pay separately for that. 
Overpriced for the overall experience. Thank goodness I had good company or I would have had a horrible time. 
Probably won't go back though. I'd much rather pick up to-go sushi from Sprouts & eat at my desk."}
{"text":"Love the purple rice. It adds a little bit of moisture to the rolls which completely transforms them into something magical. It's like eating a unicorns horn. 

Try the Oh My God roll for a special treat."}
{"text":"I came in here a couple times and the food here was excellent as well as the service. The only thing I would criticize is the attitude of one chef, Juno. It made me uncomfortable seeing the way he treated the other workers rudely. Everything else was great, great, great!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! So happy with our experience, we are back for round two in one week!!:)"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I have had in the Phoenix Area. The prices are pretty reasonable and you'll quickly develop go-to orders if you start to frequent this place like I have. They have some kick-ass service and I've never had to wait long to be seated, or for my order to come. 

If you do decide to go - try the Oh My God. It is a visual and delectable treat."}
{"text":"I've been having a hard time finding TASTY reasonably priced sushi in downtown phoenix. I'm very picky about sushi , especially in Arizona (considering I'm from a place where there is an ocean) I know it's hard to find yummy fresh sushi here in AZ. I gave Harumi a shot after reading many reviews of them online as well as other places. The food is DELICIOUS! we ordered 4 rolls. Las Vegas , Oh My God , Philly , Spicy Tuna. My room mate ordered a soda and our bill came to be only $36 bucks. Our rolls had 10 pieces each! they use purple rice , and the fish was fresh and it tasted VERY good. I highly recommend this place and I know for sure i'll be back! I almost hate how close it is to my house because I'm going to want to eat there everyday! But truly it is very good , the service is good . The tables are pretty close to each other so we were able to interact with our table neighbors which I LOVE. If you're considering another sushi place.. STOP and just go to Harumi. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Delicious sushi that I will definitely come back to! Try the Harumi roll, or the H3 roll!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and a lot of diverse rolls and alternatives. I've only tried the H3 roll so far and it was amazeballs! The staff is very nice and attentive. I will be going back for more."}
{"text":"LOVED the sushi here!  Their OMG role is literally on Fire!  We will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here while traveling for business with 2 colleagues. We all stuffed ourselves on beautiful forbidden rice sushi and stayed well under our budget. The rice lends a subtle fragrant taste to the sushi that really elevates it. If you're looking for a new experience, you won't be sorry. And they also have gluten free soy sauce upon request (for a small fee)."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town, no doubt. Owner is awesome and staff is very friendly. You can't go wrong at Harumi."}
{"text":"best. sushi. ever.
The food is amazing, and prices reasonable. The owner was friendly and just, really lovely. First time here we brought a well-traveled family member who was also duly impressed with the quality and selection of food."}
{"text":"I loved the sushi here! The atmosphere and friendliness of the chef is amazing and everything we ordered was amazing. Nothing was overly seasoned and even the smallest appetizers were put together with care. 
We ordered a seaweed salad, udon noodles, spider roll, oh my god roll, and the caterpillar roll. 
The only negative comment would be that we ordered 2 miso soups and they never came so we had them taken off the ticket and the waitresses weren't very attentive, but the quality of the food definitely made up for it!"}
{"text":"Wow! Went to a Mercury game tonight & saw the reviews of this place. Even though I arrived just before closing they were great! Ordered Chirashi (my go to) and it was superb! A bowl filled with the freshest fish I have had since being anywhere near the west coast including San Francisco. If you are visiting Phoenix or live here, this is a must visit. Let me know if you disagree."}
{"text":"Best sushi experience in Phoenix by far. Juno-san is the best!  Ordered the omakase as usual. Amazing!  U won't be disappointed!  Arigatou gozaimashita!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!!! Will definitely be frequenting this sushi bar! Really awesome customer service and a nice sample!
Love the seared tuna, spicy tuna roll and the sex and the city specialty roll."}
{"text":"This reminded me of living in the Bay. Great authentic food for a fair price and real atmosphere."}
{"text":"Truly outstanding sushi, not just for Arizona, but on an absolute scale.  There were 5 of us, we ordered a wide variety of items.  Everything was tasty and all the fish tasted very fresh.  The seared tuna appetizer and the mixed blue fin sushi were exceptional.  The waitress recommended the Kikusui sake, which made a perfect accompaniment for the meal."}
{"text":"This is a cool little sushi bar it is close to the Talking Stick Arena. They use purple rice which has a different texture but is very good. This is not the best sushi ever but it is perfect before an event."}
{"text":"All I eat is nigiri so I get to judge the place just on the quality and freshness of their fish. I have to say I was very impressed - definitely one of the best places in Arizona. Whenever we come here and stay at our snowbird house we go to Harumi at least once a week.

Everyone is super friendly, but like I said, we come for the fresh, amazing tasting fish! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the sushi has been really good, they use purple rise which is different but makes the rainbow roll look good. One of my favorite sushi places in Phoenix. It's a small place but the seating arrangement seems to work. I would give it a try for sure. They have a 3 item combo that comes in handy when u can't decide what you want."}
{"text":"Really liked their sushi! Reasonably priced and great fresh sushi. Loved the purple rice :) 30%off after 2pm"}
{"text":"I am absolutely addicted to this place.  I work in CityScape so it's an easy walk for lunch, and I have to admit I've been eating here about three or four times a week.  Just really good, really convenient, very friendly, and I'm obsessed with their \"forbidden rice\" - it's actually purple, full of antioxidants and healthier than processed white rice."}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but living in Vancouver has turned me into a Sushi snob. You can't swing a dead cat without hitting good affordable Sushi.
So while in Phoenix I was craving a raw fish and ramen fix, and Yelp lead me here. This place lives up to it's reputation. The sushi is tasty (the purple rice is an interesting touch), the service is SUPER friendly and the ramen wasn't bad. 
I walked away with a full belly and it was easy on the wallet. If I find myself back in Phoenix, I'll be making a stop here."}
{"text":"Excellent food every time!!! However, service at this place is less than desirable... Monday evening, the place is very slow. The staff always wants to put you in a corner at the back of the restaurant. I ask for a booth and am immediately met with attitude. After being sat the staff proceeded to ignore us for 10 minutes. Finally we get a server to come over and say \"are you ready\" the whole dining experience was that of being ignored and dirty looks... I tipped 15% ONLY because I'm in the service industry. Just a side note, the place wasn't any busier upon leaving as it was arriving."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi - fresh, beautifully plated, always a treat. The rice to filling ratio in the sushi rolls is perfect. The nigiri is awesome. We were despairing over the lack of really good sushi in Phoenix after moving here a couple years ago, and then Harumi opened and our lives changed! Juno often comes over to speak with us and we've been treated to complimentary edamame, rolls, desserts, and sometimes even wine. We feel valued as customers and have truly never had a sub-par experience here. Pro tip: Try the Omakase!"}
{"text":"Not so impressed here.  Sushi texture was off, like the fish had been refrozen too many times.  Tried the H3 roll and the Harumi roll.  Rolls were too big to eat and overall texture was mushy and over sauced.  I like my fish to be the star.  This was similar to fancy supermarket sushi."}
{"text":"Yesterday for lunch was the first time I tried this restaurant. First impression was, \"Long line,won't have time to wait.\" After a regular customer told us that they move pretty quickly, we decided to wait. I'm so happy we did! The staff was friendly. The food was prepared quickly, but didn't look thrown together at all. Then came the taste test... Absolutely amazing! Fresh tasting and just out of bounds. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here on a crowded Saturday night.  This place appears to be Korean owned and operated, which makes this sushi place authentic.  Though the food was good, not a bad bite in any of the dishes I had, I felt that the sashimi salad ($13) was too spicy.  The spicy salmon roll ($6) was a bargain though it is small.  The OMG roll ($13) large, which was recommended by a friend and on yelp, was basically a shrimp tempura roll with fake lobster salad and eel on top with spicy mayonnaise placed in foil and set ablaze for 5 minutes which when opened leaves a nice smokey BBQ type after taste.  Though it's good taste and texture are nothing to complain about, I would skip this a second time because it contains no raw fish and though the open flame at your table is cool, as a raw fish lover the OMG roll isn't for me nor is it for raw fish lovers I'm sure.  There are other large $13 rolls that have raw fish on their menu and I advise those instead.  I Also had the spicy scallops roll which was too spicy for me.  I also had the $13 salmon sashimi which is 8 large pieces with radish and it's good and again nothing to complain about.  I'll give Harumi a solid 4 stars because of food and service.  I can tell the waiters are really into their jobs and love what they do.  I never had to look for them and they always seemed to be paying attention to everything and everyone and if you did flag them down they help you even if she wasn't your waitress.  Also the purple/black rice is a departure from the more classic way rolls are made but this place knows what they are doing and it didn't affect texture or taste.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great sushi joint. Friendly service, small and popular so be prepared for a short wait. The OMG roll is a must. Great presentation and quality."}
{"text":"The sushi here is fantastic, but the thing that really makes this place stand apart is their service."}
{"text":"It's the first time that I write a review for a restaurant but this place is just amazing, the sushis are soo good and they use black rice which is a healthier rice, it is not an All you can eat sushi but it's really worth the price, our favorite was the Oh my god Roll, make sure to take it, it's something that you have to experience! I have tried a lot of sushi places but this one is definitely the best, the service was amazing also, salmon and fish really fresh, well, I recommend this place, and we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Epic sushi hands down one of the best I've had. Juno uses black rice in his sushi. If you haven't had it. Give your body a cancer fighting super food here."}
{"text":"Met a friend who I had not seen in years for lunch. His suggestion was Harumi. Could not have been happier, both in spending time with someone who I was able to re-connect with, as well as eating sushi, sashimi and and nigiri that was extraordinarily good. Blue fin, seared tuna as well as toro, along with a couple of great rolls. I will certainly return. Truly some of the best sushi I have had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The sushi is amazing and the staff is very friendly. The fish tastes fresh and so do the ingredients. Definitely my favorite sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I love the sashimi, as the fish is so fresh, it's like butta.... give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Staying in downtown Phoenix and craving some sushi, we stopped in. We went right at 6pm on a Wednesday night and they were busy and already had a wait! They serve sushi with black rice which is a neat little fun distinction, but I honestly couldn't taste any difference from usual sushi rice. The OhMyGod roll is a definite must and was delicious! The staff are nice but they were like chickens running around with their heads cut off being so busy. It's a little noisy, but overall a great little place."}
{"text":"Coming here I was tempted to get one of my sushi staples, shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, salmon roll...but looking at all the funky dishes flying by me I had to be adventurous. I tried all the rolls with out cream cheese (sushi faux pas no matter how fancy the place is) - impressed.  My favorite was the ahi tower which is a tower of ahi.  Beautiful to look at and more amazing to eat.  If you're downtown and you want a quick bite this def should be your first stop."}
{"text":"I don't even eat sushi. I do now! Every thing was amazing.  Tempura is sooo good! And inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi rolls, even for picky people.  They will cater rolls to your taste.  I will definitely come back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"The rolls here are considerably bigger than at other places for the same price. The fish is fresh tastes wonderful and so do the ingredients."}
{"text":"I'm allergic to seafood, and I died! But the sushi was great! I highly recommend eating here unless you're allergic, because you'll die, too."}
{"text":"FINALLY...an amazing sushi restaurant! This is the best sushi I've had in the Phoenix metro area. I was recently in Hawaii and the fish was as fresh as in Hawaii...seriously! I work downtown a couple of days a week and used to dread the commute. Now I have something to look forward to. I actually want to go to work downtown just so I can go to Harumi for lunch and get take-out for dinner.

Pros: 
1. Extremely fresh fish (and not just for the desert)
2. Great prices ((e.g. Lunch: $10 for 6 nigiri and 4 pieces of spicy tuna roll; same thing for $7 after 2 pm) 
3. VERY friendly, proud, and helpful staff and owners
4. They have fresh wasabi (worth the extra $2)
5. Purple rice (different in an excellent way; sweet, sticky, and complements the sushi perfectly)

Cons: 
1. Sushi lunch special (e.g. $10 for 6 nigiri and 4 pieces of spicy tuna roll) is limited to what is in the refrigerated case. If you get there later in the day (obviously) the selection is more limited.
2. Even though the fresh wasabi is $2 extra and really worth it, it would be even better to get it for free.

Wonderful sushi restaurant. Already planning my return."}
{"text":"Solid sushi place with a wide variety on the menu and fast friendly service. I would recommend eating here when your in the area and will be back myself."}
{"text":"My wife and I went midweek on the advice of a friend. Having just moved to Central Phx from Scottsdale, I immediately recognized the menu as being the same as Kodo, which I've eaten at multiple times.

Weird, funky space, but we liked it. Service was quick, but brusque. We noted the server would only speak to me and would not acknowledge my wife. It was over 100 outside and pretty toasty inside. Sadly that high ambient temperature affected the fish, too.

For us, sushi is ultimately all about the quality of the fish. You can have all the wacky rolls and ingredients you wish. But if it's crap fish, it's crap sushi. Harumi isn't crap, but it's not great. I was really put off by the temperature and texture of some of the nigiri. No one got sick, of course, but I left food on the plate, which I've never done at a sushi restaurant.

Honestly, Hiro in N. Scottsdale is still the best sushi in the Valley. I'll wait a couple days for a reservation and drive half an hour for the freshest fish you'll find. As for Harumi, I can't imagine we'll return."}
{"text":"PHX \"it\" sushi place. Purple rice + fresh fish= prime sushi. Definitely costly but worth it. Order the chef choice and a couple more rolls, pretty filling but was hungry again in a couple hours. There's no sushi place in or around PHX that is comparable."}
{"text":"Super good!! It's really 5 stars but I took one for the limited menu ONLY - otherwise it's very good with nice people staffing it. Love the casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've tried all the sushi joints in downtown phoenix and this is by far the best........Amazing sushi.......Love the spicy tuna hand roll....... The nigiri is very solid to boot. Love the purple rice nice touch."}
{"text":"We ordered three rolls and they gave us back two big samples which was really very delicious! Also game us the mochi as dessert ! Love this sushi!"}
{"text":"Great sushi! Vibe is what you'd expect from most sushi restaurants. I had the Spicy Scallop Roll and the 3 Mini Roll (you pick any 3). The 3 Mini Roll is more than enough for one person and allows you to try a few different rolls. Total it was 15 slightly bigger than average pieces."}
{"text":"Super fresh tasting - full of Phoenix's version of hipsters... black canvas slip gym shoes, backward caps, shorts and blank colored tees... you know...

While this is certainly sushi in a broadest sense - it's totally hipster sushi.  It's mainly rolls. Rolls of every conceivable name.  The rice is only the dark variety ( hipsters ).  That kind of rice changes the texture and consistency of the meal and adds a different finish to each bite... it also doesn't pick up the flavors as well having its own.  

IMHOP rolls all start to taste the same because they are usually so sauce intensive. Small sushi and sashimi selection.

Again, very fresh, super friendly, and very busy!

Go for a casual great selection of rolls downtown."}
{"text":"Been there only once but it was awesome.  I don't give 5 stars to someplace I haven't been too more than once but I fully expect this place to earn it.

Went there with a friend from out of town and we were not disappointed.  Awesome sushi at a great price with a great atmosphere.  The owner/chef was lively and interacted with some other customers...  It was definitely entertaining as a group of women were having a girls night out and had ordered the \"Sexy Roll\".  An enthusiastic announcement when it was up was pretty interesting.

Thinking about this place makes me think about how I definitely need to go back."}
{"text":"Food: We got salmon belly cuts for the nigiri as a special treat from the chef, and it glorious. It melted in my mouth. Probably the best salmon nigiri I've ever had. In addition to the nigiris, we go three other rolls. they were good, but the spicy mayo sauce kind of over powered the all the other flavors. Despite the over powering sauce I was able to taste the seaweed paper, so that was uncommon from my experiences at other restaurants.

Service: The service was good, but they seem disorganized. After we order the food. the chef kept coming to our table to check what has been delivered, and this happened 2-3 times (we ordered 4 things). We did come an hour before closing though, so that may be why.

Overall it was a very good experience. Definitely will come back again once I save up enough change for the parking meters."}
{"text":"Just had the sashimi sampler and a mango roll. Both were top notch. The quality of the fish was superb. Perfect sized pieces with wonderful flavor and texture. The sashimi plate came with a nice crusted tataki style  albacore, very unique, very tasty. The roll we had was beautiful with more fish than rice (rare these days) and the rice was a very delicious and purple in color. It had a subtle nutty flavor that I have never experienced. I am going back tonight with friends. Its so good and priced right. Love it."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Make sure to try the OMG roll! The portions were great and can't beat the pricing! Will be coming back here again for sure! The owner was super friendly and welcoming as well as his staff!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots in phx (second to sakana). they use purple rice for their rolls, that alone is awesome. The fish is fresh. Fresher that other establishments with higher prices. There are grab and go rolls that are fresh, but if it is not busy you might as well order made to order rolls. I actually picked rolls that other yelpers suggested and raved about and i was totally satisfied! Oh yea, price point is on point. :)"}
{"text":"Great food everything had wonderful flavor ... sitting right next to the ice machine and like in the beer storage room was not enjoyable but the overall atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"This is the best Sushi in PHX. Save room for dessert, too!

I've been here several times with my wife & daughter. The Chef never fails to greet us!"}
{"text":"Their service and sushi is so good!  Surprise place that has great specials, fresh fish, seaweed, good value, and chef menu.  Purple rice was amazing on the roll!  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is just your average sushi place The Purple rice is pretty cool but as far as flavor taste the same as white rice sushi on the other hand was average just like any other place nothing stood out prices are pretty reasonable for being downtown there's service was average kind of slow and not very many people there parking sucks cuz you have to pay so if I'm downtown I want sushi ya but come back but I wouldn't go on my way again for it"}
{"text":"This is some of the best sushi I've ever had! 

They have the freshest fish, purple rice and O-toro yummm! 
I definitely recommend going here since it is most likely the most fresh fish in Arizona. 
Keep it up Harumi! Yummmm"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm a vegetarian and have been looking for a sushi place since my favorite closed down, and this is it.  My favorite roll is the sweet potato roll -- note: their eel sauce is vegetarian! I asked my waitress if it was vegetarian, and she brought me the bottle with its ingredients on it.  It is pretty small, so expect a wait if you're going at a busy time."}
{"text":"Wow. Get the chef special. Whatever it is, get it. It's great. I eat sushi lots of places in the states and this is one of my new top picks. Great/fresh tasting fish."}
{"text":"Love! This place is reasonably priced, fresh, and tasty.  I also must say I've never had better service- my drink was always full and the chef gave us four small plate specials without charge! 

We started with a miso soup and veggie tempura.  The tempura was very crispy and has great flavor, and the vegetables were very fresh.  Spicy tuna ha droll came out right when it was done, so the seaweed was crisp and never had time to get soggy.

We ordered three rolls- H3, OMG, and a tempura salmon one I can't remember the name...The rolls were all very fresh and good sized.  This is the only reason for 4/5 and not 5, the rolls we ordered were a little too similar to each other.  This could be an error in ordering but they were all delicious.  

In addition, the chef gave us two salmon nigiri, tempura yellowtail, and mango mochi! Great service, the nigiri was insanely good.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Everything we ate was amazing.  The black rice makes this place unique and adds great flavor.  I wanted to give this place 5 stars - they certainly deserve it for the food, but service was sub-par and it's quite a hike to the restrooms through the back hallway - not a great experience from that standpoint.  Worth the price and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Gotta love Harumi!  They have *REALLY* know what they are doing...and they do it well!

All of the countless rolls of sushi we ordered (WAY too much) were all excellent!  They have nice large rolls so be careful how many you order!

This is, by far, our favorite Sushi place in downtown!"}
{"text":"I've tried 10-15 sushi places in the Phoenix Valley.  This is hands down the best sushi I've had."}
{"text":"I spent NYE here a few years ago & have eaten here several times since. Just the best sushi in downtown Phoenix bar none. They are super accommodating & the food is stellar. I really love that they have fresh wasabi none of that powder stuff we're all told is wasabi. The purple rice is sooo good. They have some creative rolls like the OMG & the standby's are all done well too. My favorite menu item is the Spicy Sashimi Salad. The portion is giant & the price is right. My mouth is watering thinking of it. I think I know where I'm going to dinner tonight. I have zero idea how many sushi places I drive past to get to this one & don't particularly care. But I drive 30 minutes just to get the sushi here. Definitely try it if you like sushi."}
{"text":"We were here the past two nights and it is wonderful. Fresh amazing sushi!!!
We were heading g back there today but we're bummed they are closed on Sunday BUT we're thankful for Friday and Saturday. The staff is crazy friendly and Juno was a kick!!! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant in Phoenix. My boyfriend I go to Harumi at least 4x a month. They're located in downtown Phoenix and its a small restaurant so at dinner time, there's almost always a wait! It's worth the wait though. Something that makes this sushi restaurant stand up above the rest is that they use Black Rice which cooks out to be purple. It has better benefits than brown rice but has the consistency of white rice, which is fantastic! The food comes out so fast it's almost unbelievable. My favorites include the Shrimp Tempura appetizer (it tastes like breakfast sausage for some reason and it's so incredible), Seared Salmon Nigiri (they gave it to me complimentary one time and I've been addicted since), and I always order the Mini Combo Roll so I can get a few of my favorites. Honestly, there's never been a roll there that wasn't good. You won't be disappointed with this place so come with an appetite! You'll be happy to know that you're supporting a small business as well!"}
{"text":"Juno is the best. His staff's attention to detail and the quality he maintains in every dish shows."}
{"text":"Had such high hopes when I walked in but was let down by the staff!!!! No one came to introduce themself or take my drink order until 15 minutes after I was seated and that was ONLY because I had to get up and ask the cashier why the people that were previously standing in the line behind me got taken care of first. The cashier immediately felt guilty and took my order that second. She waived my drink charge.. Of unsweetened tea when I specifically asked for sweetened tea. That was the only time I saw my waiter.. when she took my order. I sat there for about 20 minutes AFTER I was done with my food hoping that someone would come with my check but nope.. I had to get up AGAIN to ask the cashier.. I left what I owed and left a tip for the hard working sushi chefs. 

P.S: the sushi presentation was nice. Ive had better nigiri. The sex in the city was 40% cream cheese. It tasted like it was rushed out. Very disappointed. 

Don't know if I'll ever visit again"}
{"text":"Yes the purple rice threw me off, but it only added to the PERFECTION of the rest of the sushi! The oh my god roll literally made me \"oh my god!\" And their shrimp tempura is amazing. Easily the best sushi restaurant I've been to. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Superb!  Excellent!  Magnifico!   When we moved to AZ a few months ago, I wasn't sure I'd find good sushi, but a friend assured me it could be found.  We have found a few good places, but I think the best is probably right outside my office here at Harumi.  My favorite is the Las Vegas roll, but everything I've had has been delicious.  Very fresh.  Today I decided to try the Stuffed Jalapeno appetizer.  OMG!  So good!  Service is always top notch as well - always friendly and welcoming.  If you love sushi, you must try Harumi!"}
{"text":"While I haven't tried many sushi places in downtown Phoenix, I don't think I need to keep looking. Harumi Sushi is pretty fantastic. The staff is always friendly - even for take out orders. Also, they have a cooler where you can just grab freshly-made rolls to-go. 

The fish is fresh, and the rice is purple! I haven't seen this offered in any other place. 
The prices are reasonable for what you get.

Tip: If you do dine in, get the OMG roll! The server brings it out in wrapped in tin foil. Once unwrapped, the roll is on fire! It's a pretty cool display, and everyone around is usually curiously peeping over too! 

Anyway, it's a must-go!"}
{"text":"When I moved to Phoenix from California I was repeatedly told that there is no good Sushi in Arizona. Harumi Sushi defies this idea. Even more amazing is the fact that the Sushi is well priced and served from a restaurant that is a bit of a hole in the wall. Most sushi places you will find are large and planned, but Harumi has the charm of being hidden away amongst the big buildings. For the homesick, you can almost imagine you are in LA, SF or NYC. 

While the quality of the food is top notch, the other most important factor is the presence of the owner. Most nights he is there checking on everyone and making you feel special by offering extra treats. If you are in town visiting or miss home, come to Harumi - I do and I am always happy with the choice."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood hangout! It felt like everyone was a well known regular. All customers were treated very well by the warm and friendly staff. Ordered some rolls: spicy tuna, rainbow, and the Arizona. All were tasty, yet spicier than expected! The purple rice is fun, however, one of my rolls had some crunchy rice... we also ordered an udon noodle soup and pot stickers. All were very good! Would return again!"}
{"text":"My partner and I still go here regularly (and recommend it to all our friends!), but our amazing experience last Saturday has just driven me to write an official update. HANDS DOWN, HARUMI IS THE BEST! It has amazing, fresh, unique sushi - seriously, probably the best and most flavorful sushi ingredients in the valley! - along with a warm, inviting atmosphere. We sat near the sushi bar and got to watch the owner himself preparing sashimi and maki with skill and care. He was SO HAPPY and cheerful to be there and seriously loves what he does! The whole time he was calling out to greet customers from the sushi bar and checking with us personally to ensure that the food and experience were satisfying. He joked and went around to all the tables to talk a little with each customer, and his presence was seriously so warm and sincere and humble. He even gave us a few slices of strawberry mochi, which of course is going to get on my good side! It's personal touches like that which make Harumi really stand out in terms of its atmosphere, customer service, and consumer experience. It ensures that we'll keep returning to Harumi time and time again - and if you haven't yet, you need to!"}
{"text":"We went to Harumi Sushi after a day of Volleyball at the convention center. There were 22 people in our party. They took great care of us and accommodated our large group wonderfully. The sushi was amazing and we did not have a bad item and we had almost everything on the menu! Some recommendations are the Chirashi, jalapeño app, and salmon sashimi.
Definitely a great sushi spot."}
{"text":"Has to be the best sushi restaurant in the valley. Hands down . Loved the texture and taste of purple rice. We just ordered the lunch regular with California roll. But our fav was a toss up between the arizona roll and the H3. Was a 20 min drive from my place but was well worth it. Loved it will be back. Quick service and well priced. :)"}
{"text":"Came after lunch. ...before dinner crowd hits. Perfect timing. We had the whole place to ourselves! Ordered edamame, Vegas roll & stuffed jalapeños. Absolute Heaven. Service great food was perfection! Gotta bring the sushi fans here for sure! Only drawback - parking."}
{"text":"Great presentation and taste.  Will definitely make this a must stop if you are a sushi lover passing through Phoenix."}
{"text":"Sushi was great. Service was quick and the server was very friendly. Not sure it's 5 stars but it sure is the best sushi around."}
{"text":"This restaurant has excellent food and the staff are kind and welcoming. They don't have many gluten-free options (tamari) but the overall experience was very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. I got the harumi roll and loved it. The sex and the city roll was pretty good too but not as good as the harumi roll. I took off one star for the service. Our waiter was excellent, but the hostess was not. Initially my boyfriend and I were seated at a booth. We were asked to move because a group of four was coming in. I said it wasn't a problem, but then a few minutes later the hostess sits another couple at the booth we had just been sitting at. Apparently the larger group wouldn't fit in a booth. I think it's a little rude we weren't offered our seats back. We were instead at a much smaller and cramped table. My waiter even seemed a little confused about why we weren't moved back. I get that being a hostess can be a busy job, but I felt she could have done a better job."}
{"text":"Awesome and my favorite place in Phoenix to eat sushi. The prices are just like any other sushi place which will run from 9& up in each roll. The staff & chefs are amazing! Great service and great food."}
{"text":"I'd give it 10 if I could, holy cow! I've been to most of the Sushi places in and around downtown Phoenix and a few outside of the city, and I think Harumi has them all beat. The location is perfect, right at 1st Ave and Adams in downtown. We went for dinner around 5, and they were not too busy. The menu is very straight forward. A few appetizers, some basic rolls, some special rolls and some entreees. We opted for the sushi and holy cow were we impressed. We opted for this three \"mini\" roll plate tha t you get to choose from a list of maybe 7 rolls. it came with 6 piece of each, a TON of sushi ($15). We also did the Ahi Stack ($13), which was fantastic. It was the sushi rice, covered in super fresh spicy tuna, covered with some eel sauce and some spicy mayo, and some tempura flakes. Holy hell, this was FANTASTIC!!! We also opted for a basic California roll ($4) for my daughter, and some gyoza ($4.50). all in all , super fresh fish, perfect service and just awesome sushi. They use \"black rice\" which turns purple when turned into sushi rice. It didn't alter the flavor at all, but the texture a bit in the best way. All I can says is wow, wow, wow. What a great spot. I'm going back ASAP!"}
{"text":"Found this place close to our hotel. This was some pretty good sushi. Very quick service! I would go again!"}
{"text":"I went in during a lunch break. 
Food was incredibly good. Freshly prepared and served quickly. Beverages are in bottles or cans. 

It's not fancy, it is however incredibly good and very cheap too.

For three dishes (a crispy sushi roll 8pc, eel nigiri 2pc and chicken gyoza 8pc) and a large beer, it was under $25. 

Service was friendly and it seemed busy. Eating in was a \"mark on a menu with pencil\" affair. Busy for good reason. I'll happily return next time I'm in the downtown area."}
{"text":"The sushi is excellent! Try the oh my god roll and the sushi combos! Also the nicest staff and quick service. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Loved this place downtown. It gets packed so go early, go late, or u will wait. Service was great for us , but we went with regulars who had a couple if stinkeye moments with staff but it hasnt stopped them ever from coming back. The overall service and food is not going to ruin an experience based on one servers bad day or two. What to order? Honestly, we had so much we tried and loved l hesitate to recommend, but if I must...Get the real wasabi-even if ur not a fan, just try it, not the same ( but if u hate horseradish...not for u) The seared salmon is also excellent, and this comes from two people that put salmon at the bottom of the list. Would go out of my way to hit this place again."}
{"text":"Deeeeeelicious! Easily the best and freshest sushi in the valley. I got the harumi roll and the H3 and both were total knockouts. Service was INSANELY fast- we were in and out in 30 minutes (and not at all rushed). We got our entrees in less time than it normally takes to get an appetizer... on a Friday!! I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Loved the whole grain rice - I hadn't seen that before. Beautiful cuts of fish and very large rolls - a couple rolls goes a long way!"}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi that I've had in Phoenix.  The atmosphere is great and the servers are awesome.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Started with stuffed jalapenos and they were great.  Not very spicy hot but flavorful. 2nd round was Oh My God, which is lite on fire at the table.  Be prepared to be looked at afterwards.  3rd was sex in the city. I stayed with the rolls.   Everything was tasty. Service was good.  Sushi pricing doesn't allow for a lot of tastings, so more of a treat."}
{"text":"We went here on pure rating and number of reviews. Well I have to say my son and I could honestly say it may be the best sushi we have ever had. And we love sushi!!!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot downtown. Wasn't too busy and the service was quick. The raw salmon was fresh. The AZ, shrimp tempura and OMG rolls were all delicious hot and fresh. Parking isn't bad if not busy along the south side of building. Make sure to have change as the spots are metered. The customer service is friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"The only place I want sushi from now on! 

Can't believe I waited this long to try this! Everything was delicious and I couldn't be happier. 

Let me start by saying the service was outstanding! They accommodated our party of 8 with a baby with no fuss whatsoever. Young was our waitress and she was very attentive but not overwhelming. 

I love how fresh everything tasted and how everything was flavored. It wasn't overwhelmingly sauced but enough that you don't need to dip in soy sauce. 

The spicy crab salad was a pleasant surprise and a nice start to the meal. I thought is would come out in a bowl but instead it came out as a roll and I loved it! Very refreshing.

I don't think you can go wrong with any of the rolls because we sure didn't and we ordered almost half the menu. Fish is very fresh!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing! We had the spicy scallop roll and the H3 roll. The forbidden black rice was delicious. The sauce with the gyoza was great! Will definitely come back. Glad my husband works around the block. This is a perfect little get away for lunch."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot in downtown Phoenix. The stuffed jalapenos and Harumi Roll are awesome. Friendly staff and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is my new Favorite!!!
From the all Natural Purple rice, it's freshness and also Great Service!!!! :)
   Not only do you get a Miso Soup and Edamame just by checking in, but you also get to enjoy some of the best sushi rolls this town has seen!!
For our order we decided to get the Sex in the City roll, the H3 roll and the Arizona roll, all three of these were delicious, especially the H3 roll Yummy and fresh!! 
 Next, I will try the ramen!! We will see how that goes :)
   I just wish they had a location close to home! Other than my lazy wishes, I love this place, the service, the freshness and their efficiency!! :)
A must try for sure!!!! :)"}
{"text":"WOW!!!! So mad i didn't know about this place before. Best sushi in the valley and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"The place is small fun and laid back, awesome prices, great service and the food is amazing. This is a must if you are a sushi lover!"}
{"text":"I was in the area running some errands and was craving some salmon sashimi and shrimp tempura for lunch!

You order food at the register before sitting down. They have some pretty good lunch specials. I got 8 pieces of salmon sashimi and a tempura bento box which came out to around ~$22 which is fairly priced. The bento box comes with rice, salad, and your choice of bento entree. They are pretty generous with the portions. The salmon was get fresh and delicious. I definitely got my omega3 intake for the day!! The food was good, but I had to keep asking them for chopsticks, soy sauce dish, and tempura dipping sauce. Other than that, the staff was very friendly and polite. It was a decent escape for lunch!"}
{"text":"I've been to harumi many times and it's always pretty great, but just went and had the omakase and it was truly incredible. This is a downtown gem, wonderful staff, amazing food, and a laid back vibe."}
{"text":"Wonderful service like usual and outstanding food, the number one sushi in phoenix. We'll be back soon !"}
{"text":"The sushi here is excellent. I sort of stumbled upon this place while visiting downtown Phoenix for a week-long work conference and was immediately impressed and surprised by the the purple sushi rolls. Apparently the black rice they use is much better for you and was really delicious and fun to look at! I've been back to Phoenix multiple times since then for more conferences and I always stop by and get myself a couple rolls that are both delicious and extremely reasonably priced. They use great quality tasting fish with a good sweet flavor and an pretty good list of both basic and specialty rolls to choose from."}
{"text":"I went to Harumi yesterday for the first time and it was amazing! The sushi was great, the service was great, the atmosphere was great, and the owner was great! I will definitely go back and recommend this place to others. Harumi is by far the best sushi place in the valley."}
{"text":"Was not impressed by the place. The food was lacking some flavor when it came to the Spicy rolls. The pictures of the food did not match what I ordered. The restaurant was warmer than I would expect which worried me a bit. I believe the reviews may have been a little to generous as far as the quality goes. It is affordable and fast like you may have read before, but it just falls short in everything else. Maybe it's worth a second shot, perhaps they had an off day!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special with udon noodles and a shrimp tempura roll. My udon noodles came out and my tempura roll never came. As I watched my friend finish his meal, and 25 minutes pass I still get no roll. I finally ask my waitress what happened and I get a confused look on their face. Long story short, I never got my roll and they asked me if I wanted 50% off my bill. I stated, no I'm came here to eat"}
{"text":"Sushi was not fresh. The chefs and servers were nice and I believe they can create a great menu, but the rolls are definitely not fresh and there were flies all over which means they don't clean well. Unfortunately, I became sick after my meal and will not return."}
{"text":"Amazing taste! Every roll we ordered was delicious! Each had it's own unique taste. The Oh My God roll is my favorite. Service is excellent and the chefs truly know what they are doing."}
{"text":"OK rolls.  Didn't feel like they were rolled with much care. Nigiri was good, nice fresh fish and roe."}
{"text":"Harumi Sushi is a prejudiced establishment, pure and simple. Do not go to this restaurant unless you would like to be profiled and discriminated against! Not to mention the customer service is nonexistent. My fiance and I form an interracial relationship. We went to Harumi on a busy Friday night, and put down our names with the hostess. After everyone who had come before us had been seated, it was our turn. However, three white couples were seated before we were. When I approached the hostess about my grievance she called over the manager. He dismissed our complaint and returned to the kitchen without even uttering a word to us! The hostess looked awkwardly at us, and continued to seat others before us! This place is garbage, and honestly you can find better, more authentic sushi in the valley. My recommendation is to try Yama Sushi House, right up Central from this trash-heap."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about how great this place was but i thought it was mediocre. The rice was a little too mushy for my liking. There were a lot of pieces that came in each roll but I didnt think anything really stood out besides the purple rice in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Got taken here by my co-worker who swears by it and if we are going just off of sashimi, I have to say it's pretty damn good. It's a little odd to see a sushi restaurant with no actual sushi bar imo, and there are plenty of items that are just missing from the menu that are fairly standard in sushi restaurants (uni, hand rolls, etc). It's a Korean owned joint which is no big deal as the majority of places these days are as such and the staff there are jamming it up and having a good time. Some people commented on the purple rice and that didn't really bother me. Typically any rolls you order are just filler as it's too easy to hide the quality of fish and the rice is packed to fill you up...the rice being purple to that point is irrelevant and it tastes like white rice. It's an all right place, but not sure I'd come back unless forced to by my co-worker again."}
{"text":"Went here because of all the stellar reviews. All I can say is \"yep. Thats sushi\". I guess I'm just spoiled living near a bunch of great sushi places. However, if your looking for huge hunks of raw fish served by not very friendly staff, then this is your place. 
     On a positive note. This place uses black rice which was a nice quirky change from the ordinary and the other big plus was that they do offer real grated wasabi (for an additional charge). Overall, portion size is over the top for a low low price."}
{"text":"Get the Tuna Tower then top it with fresh wasabi. Mmmmmmmmhmm!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times recently and let's see if i can bullet point for you:

Food: tasty. We always get the nigiri and a few rolls and the nigiri the first time we ever went was Ahmazinggg... The 2nd and third time were good, not amazing. I'm not sure why. The rolls are delicious if you know what you like. My favorite are crunchy, fatty, little spot of sweet and I'll add the spice.  That means i stick to rolls with those characteristics and I've yet to be disappointed.

Service:
Great. We have anyways been attended very well and it's been from several different servers. The guys behind the counter are nice and wave and have even sent over complimentary tastings.

Ambiance:
Varies. First time was super quiet and empty, next time was medium busy, third time was loud and full of very chatty clientele.

They have a selection of Japanese beers and sake and my hubs and i have always order the same ones every time because they're just good: Koshihikari echigo is what i get and hubs had the red Kawaba."}
{"text":"Purple rice? High in antioxidants? Flaming plate with sushi in foil? Now that sounds like a jamming place for sushi! To add on to all the great ratings, this place meets the hype.

The sushi at first tastes healthy, maybe I was just sold on this purple rice phenomenon, but wow, it was fresh. Not just fresh meaning cool but the actual definition fresh. The OMG roll intros with all the bells and whistles with the flaming plate slightly cooking the eel. It tastes like some old school Filipino BBQ with a finish of fresh fish. The H3 roll was spicy, but refreshing flavor from the sauce.

The service was welcoming with timely check ups throughout dinner. My wife and I enjoyed the food! The food is quality and we will be back since she works in the down town area!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding sushi in Phoenix...Hell yes and one of the best I have ever experienced! 
I will be back..
If you are downtown or not hit this place! 
Wonderful wow!"}
{"text":"I was in town from Fort Worth for the NSNA convention and needed a place to celebrate my friends birthday. This place is a short 10 minute walk from the Sheraton. It's small, but the staff readily took our reservation for 12. We arrived and were warmly welcomed by the entire staff. Our waitresses were very helpful and efficient during ordering especially since people were paying individually. The birthday boy and I shared 4 rolls- H3, Crazy, Spider, & the Super Crunch. I also had the seaweed salad- it was cold, tangy and so tasty! Others ordered the Las Vegas, shrimp tempura, pot stickers, and veggie tempura. Everyone loved the food. It was fresh, the purple rice was fun, the sushi chefs were extremely fast. The head chef even brought out some type of salmon roll for said birthday boy and we all sang. Afterward we found a little room for mango mochi and green tea ice cream. Delicious! The pricing is very reasonable and we would definitely return! If you don't like sushi this is not the place for you as the non-sushi items are limited to udon or appetizers. Definitely check this place out if you're in town!"}
{"text":"Best unagi in Phoenix that I've had. It was a generous unagi piece. The sashimi is also very fresh and melts in your mouth. The best part is that they use purple rice! It makes for a wonderful IG post"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix! I have been let down by several sushi restaurants here in the valley before but Harumi will definitely not disappoint! It is a very casual restaurant that is great for lunch and dinner. Several reviews here suggested that the food here is far superior to the casual atmosphere, which may have some merit behind it, however, I think the casual ambience is one of the best aspects of this restaurant. Remaining a casual restaurant allows anyone to come in for a casual lunch or singles or couples to stop in for dinner without having to make a whole night out of it. 

Chef Juno and his team are very skilled at their craft. As for the wait staff, I think they could use a little more training and a refresher on their knowledge of menu.

Tonight we checked-in on Yelp and received a free order of miso soup and edamame. Both were delicious! For our entires we ordered the H3 roll and the Oh My God roll. The H3 had a great spicy kick. The Oh My God roll is served on a flaming plate and wrapped in tinfoil. It is quite a sight to see! This is a must try for anyone who has not been here before. It is very savory and smokey roll that will satisfy any craving.

For dessert I was considering the green tea ice cream tempura, but before we could order Juno sent an order of the green tea mochi on the house. He is so nice to his costumers! The mochi was good, but I would have liked to have tried it without the chocolate sauce.

I would highly recommend Harumi for anyone who is looking for a great casual sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow! As someone who doesn't eat sushi at all, I had very low expectations for Harumi Sushi, even though I had heard lots of good things. From the first bite to the last bite, I was in sushi heaven! Cannot wait to go back for more!!

We arrived earlier in the evening on a Friday and snagged a parking spot across the street. It was actually pretty busy considering how early it was, but we were greeted immediately & seated towards the back. I would ask for a table closer to the front next time (the restaurant is very small but there seemed to be a lot of staff traffic in the back). Considering how good the sushi was, I'm sure it gets super busy, so I recommend going during off-hours.

Anyways, the sushi itself was amazing! I ordered the Las Vegas Roll and my fiancé got the Mini Roll Combo with three different rolls. I can't remember all the ones we picked for the combo but I do remember the Super Crunch Shrimp! It wasn't a traditional sushi roll, but I liked it because I'm a fan of shrimp! My favorite thing we got was the Las Vegas Roll but I was glad that we got to try four different items in one visit. Each option we had was unique and everything seemed really fresh.

The service was also good; all the waitresses were helping all tables, so if we needed anything, we just grabbed someone who was walking by. We will definitely be back & would recommend this restaurants to others."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with some friends. Service was fast and the food was really good. 
Big fan of the OMG Roll. Its served in a foil wrap, then rest over a flame for a minute before opening. It was fun."}
{"text":"This place isn't fancy but the staff were super friendly and the sushi was excellent.  Tuna sashimi was a generous portion. The tempura veggies were crisp and lightly breaded. One piece of tempura was a yummy hot pepper. 

The rolls and sushi are prepared with black rice. They taste good and look exotic. We saw another table served a flaming roll. It's wrapped in foil and heated on a plate of fire. 

We liked it so much we ordered a second helping including spicy tuna roll."}
{"text":"honestly! delicious.... i 've been in many sushi restaurants, and i can say harumi sushi is my favorite one.  
the staff is super friendly; including chef juno.  who likes to take care of every customer. he actually makes sure our sushi was perfect but not only that, he also made sushi the way my kids requested it,  which made my kids feel very special.  if you are looking for a place with great fresh sushi, and on top of that has a  friendly staff. harumi is the place ...try it ! you ll be writing  a good review."}
{"text":"Incredible sushi done by pros. Place is legit. Probably my favorite in Phoenix for the price--especially if you're not a hardcore elitist who would feel most comfortable at Nobuo at Teeter House, Roka Akor, or ShinBay."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest, nicest sushi in town. Exceptional presentation and good portions, particularly the sashimi. Worth a special trip."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi we have found in Phoenix! We have been here twice and the service has been excellent. We ordered a sushi combo and the H3 roll both times. The fish is really fresh and the rolls are creative. We will definitely be back soon! Metered parking is located nearby and is pretty easy to come by on a weeknight. It may be tough to find street parking on a weekend, but there are plenty of lots nearby. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"This is my husbands favorite sushi place! We don't even love in Phoenix (we are in a suburb of Chicago). This was our first stop when we came into town. The black rice is delicious. We tried the spicy tuna tataki. It was cooked perfectly. It was spicy but delicious. I would definitely get that again. The prices are very reasonable. They don't offer happy hour but that will never deter us. Everything we've ordered is awesome. I definitely recommend the H3 and spicy scallops roll too."}
{"text":"Seriously love this sushi restaurant! The staff truly care about their customers and truly value their experience. This is my second time here and each time they have taken their time to ensure each and every one of their customers has a great a experience. 
Bonus! The sushi is to die for! The OMG roll and Las Vegas is to die for! They also have a few other delicious rolls but these are my favorites. 
I come to this restaurant for the customer service and the quality of the sushi. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to dive back into sushi after a bad experience at another location in the Valley. We went here with friends that recommended it. We ordered the California roll, philly roll and Las Vegas roll and all 3 were delicious!

We will not only go back here often but we'll continue to expand our sushi horizons because of how good this was."}
{"text":"Holy portion sizes! You get a lot of bang for your buck here. And the service is super fast. I love the tempura avocado appetizer."}
{"text":"we were looking for a good place to eat in downtown phoenix and happened upon this sushi restaurant.  skeptical from our previous, unsavory ventures to other new sushi places, we were both blown away.  the food was amazing!  they have more than just sushi, but the sushi is incredibly fresh and flavorful.   with purple rice and flaming dishes (served literally on fire), the presentation is only matched by the perfect blend of fresh ingredients and attentive service. we will definitely be back. Its only appropriate that my 1st review is for this delicious place!"}
{"text":"Standard sushi, it won't blow you away but it's decent. The lunch special is pretty good, 2 small rolls and miso soup for an affordable price. Service is pretty efficient which is great because it's not a very big restaurant. You can see them cutting the fish and preparing rolls right in front of you. Bathrooms are at the end of a hall and quite dirty...didn't inspire much confidence."}
{"text":"WOW! What a find this place was.

Was downtown for a concert at Dodge Theater, and we wanted to grab a bite before the show. Walked past Z-Pizza (now closed, sadly), Harumi and the Thai place next door. Thai looked a little stuffy, Z-Pizza is kaput, so we figure sushi it is...

Place is super busy, but we get a nice booth in the back. Good banter with the older Asian gal that sat us. Dig it. We see some of the rolls on other people's plates, and they look sensational. 

They have Koshihikari Echigo and big bottles of Asahi at a reasonable price. Two of my favorites. Fuck yeah. 

Order the Poke Stack, a few rolls, some nigiri and Jalapeno Rolls. All are outstanding, some of the best fish I've had outside of super-locals-only-spots in Hawaii where I couldn't go without my Japanese lady friend. Absolutely love their rice, color and texture is perfect. The Jalapeno Roll was something I've never seen, but was executed perfectly. How they get the pepper cooked perfectly with perfect tempura on the outside is beyond me. Hats off!

Great conversation with the couple seated across from us after they ordered some sort of amazing roll served in a flaming foil fan. Very cool, and good vibes in this restaurant.

Service was fast, friendly and efficient. Food comes out quick given how busy they were. All the chefs are sure to wave \"bye\" when you leave, too.

We will definitely be back. Totally worth the trip, this is now our only sushi spot in AZ."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and quick place for lunch. Good prices and the spicy tuna is fresh and actually spicy. Definitely I'll be back."}
{"text":"Chose this place based on yelp reviews and was not disappointed. We were greeted by the entire staff when we arrived and were seated by the window so we could watch the sushi being made. The owner greeted us with a free sample of 2 piece salmon nagiri which was excellent. Started with edamame and miso soups, mmm. Then had the OMG roll and the H3! 10 piece rolls were huge! Couldn't possibly finish  but will definitely be taking it home for a midnight snack! Were visiting phoenix but when we return, we will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"I wish I had paid attention to the most recent bad review.

Our food came out missing pieces that we were charged for, came different than the description on the menu, and took over an hour to come out, and came out randomly.

The waitress was rude, dismissive, and didn't seem to care. Took over 20 minutes of us asking for the check before anyone gave us a check. Waitress hovered over my shoulder as I was filling out the tip/total section, which was more attention than we've received for the previous hour and a half.


Food was good, call ahead and get takeout."}
{"text":"First time here.  The food was excellent! We over ordered as we were unsure of the size of the rolls and were pleasantly surprised with the size of the rolls. The flavors were wonderful and the atmosphere was great.   Had a good deal of fun listening to the chefs had fun with our order of an O my God roll and a Finding Nemo roll. They kept laughing and saying Oh my God Finding Nemo table 10.   Loved it.  We will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing sushi. The owner and head chef makes this place one of the best in town."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town we wanted to try some sushi. It was crowded, food was amazing and the \"chef\" walked around and asked everyone how the food was. Very nice people and LOVED the sushi. Price was good too. The atmosphere isn't super nice, and was disappointed to watch the chef walk around with his gloves on talking, touching things, including our child's head, taking orders, etc then go back to making sushi without ever changing his gloves or washing his hands. Wish I hadn't seen that! Otherwise I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places.

Came on a weeknight with a long line. We went on the waiting list and it was about the time they said.

Space is tight, no privacy here. Time from ordering to food served was very fast, was delighted with the speed. The food (ahi poke) was absolutely delicious and we got a free miso soup. When the bill came it was an extremely reasonable dinner. 

I've since ordered takeout and that is just as yum.

Friendly servers, convenient downtown location."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Everything is very tasty and fresh. Their signature roll \"oh my gosh\" is the best: fun to watch and umm \"yummy  in my tummy\".  They serve sashimi with real wasabi seed- spicy.  Friendly staffs, and good services even when they are very busy.  Definitely best sushi in town."}
{"text":"I do not know about you guys but this is my favorite sushi place in town. I have been here plenty of times and have never been disappointed.

All the staff, including the owner of the place is super friendly! Every time I go there the owner makes sure to say hello to everybody and even comes by the table. Now, that is called amazing customer service. 

Food is absolutely delicious! I usually like to start my meal with the Misho soup. They have a great twist on everything. Best edamame I've ever had. It comes seasoned which I love. I tried so many rolls and really can't pick the favorite one. However, I can recommend few...H3 roll, Sex and the city, Oh My God Roll, Oasis roll, etc. 


The technique used to sear and flavor is really very nice. Also, they use purple rice !!! Anything you order of the menu, believe me, you will not regret it. And, do yourself a favor and get the fresh made real wasabi.

Atmosphere is super nice. It is such a welcoming place. Be sure if you go in a bigger group to call ahead for reservations, as they really get busy.

The only recommendation to the owner is, perhaps to play some Japanese music"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch while visiting for work. I was dining solo so I was seated at the bar top by the window.  Service started out fine. They have a sheet of paper that you mark your order on. I was debating about a few options (mainly trying a few things & going over my per diem, or sticking with 1 roll & staying under). I found the mini roll combo on the back which gave you the option to try 3 different items. I thought that was a good compromise & went with that.
I ordered the Arizona, shrimp tempura & super crunch shrimp. It came out pretty promptly & looked amazzzzzing. The purple rice is so unique/pretty. Everything tastes fantastic. The only drawback food wise was the super crunch was very greasy since it was fried. I love the crunch of fried stuff but I was nervous it was so greasy I'd be sick the rest of day, so I didn't finish it. 
I struggled with giving this 4 stars because the food is definitely worthy of 4 stars & I love the mini roll option which I'd never seen before, but a great way to try a few things; however the service at the end of the meal was awful. I think it took me almost 15-20 minutes to cash out. I waited at the bar for someone to pick up my payment & when no one came tried to get in line to pay at register but still waited another 5 minutes before I was helped m (& no one was in front of me). She then rang up the wrong receipt which she didn't bother to fix bc the total price was the same... anyway- stop in for a great sushi meal, as long as you aren't in a hurry to leave!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the fish is always very fresh and the purple rice is interesting the first time, but now I find whenever I go somewhere else that just has white rice that I prefer what Harumi has. My husband swore of sushi...he's from Oklahoma..I know I know...but he even will eat it here...which is a testament in and of itself. They are very friendly but I do agree from other reviews that they are very fast and sometimes can seem it is more important to get you in and out the door, but I have seen this place with a line around the corner to get in so sometimes it's understandable. A definite must try whether you are downtown or not, I have not had one bad thing here."}
{"text":"Im not a big fan of sushi but this place changed my mind!!!! Wow the sweet potato roll was amazing and the cucumber avocado roll was the best I have ever had. If sushi always tasted like this I would have moved to japan!!! The outside appearance is not to great and inside isn't very fancy and parking is a bear but get past all that and its awsome I want to go back asap."}
{"text":"We came here after a few days of really BAD food in downtown Phoenix. What a great surprise!

We were in the mood for some good sushi, and they did not disappoint. Of course, if you come here you have to try the OMG. I've never had anything like it - and now I'll miss it greatly! It's not only a fun experience (who doesn't like lighting something on fire at your table?) but the taste....just amazing!!

Super friendly staff, ice cold beer - and great food. 5 Stars all day long!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The staff is so friendly and welcoming. The sushi rolls are creative and delicious. They are some of the most flavorful sushi I've ever had. The atmosphere is lively. This place is clean, unique, friendly and savory. I cannot wait to come back. It's a great place to go alone or with company."}
{"text":"Quality Sushi. Service could have been a bit better. OMG was fun and a must try. Fresh wasabi was wonderful."}
{"text":"Great Sushi and experience fast service and polite the sushi was fantastic and there were some very creative rolls. I loved the sweet potato,roll and there purple rice was great. I would definitely visit again. The dinner menu is on long sheets where you check off your choices perfect for us but if you are new to sushi start slow."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  

Small sushi shop downtown that is legit.  We ordered a little bit of everything.
Here's the rundown:
Spicy Tuna Tataki - 5 stars - Fresh with a spicy kick and smokey flavor.  Would order every visit
Chefs Choice Sashimi - Very good.  Loved the spicy wasabi and tuna
Gyoza - fresh, hot, soft with a nice dipping sauce
Miso Soup - average but good portion for only $1.50
Phili Roll - excellent size, good balance of ingredients
Green tea ice cream - creamy, fresh, lots of green tea flavor

Excellent service.  The waitress forgot our miso and I asked her for it and she apologized and said she won't charge me for it.  I offered to pay and she still took it off the bill.  

The best was Chef Juno came out at the end of our meal and greeted us and asked us how we liked it.  I admire a chef that takes pride in his work and is personable.  He also came out and thanked us for coming and just had a great attitude.

We will be back.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying \"Thank God for Yelp!\" I would've never drove this far to eat sushi. This joint is small but man the food is unbelievable and the quality is exceptionally good. You will not go wrong. 

A nice touch that this place has is the chef or owner. Whomever he may be, he came out and made sure everyone was having a good time and a good meal! The servers were also great! 

Overall, this place is a must go to. Definitely adding to my staple sushi restaurants. Who cares about the drive, it's soo worth it!"}
{"text":"This is my sushi spot I'll pick every time! Outstanding in my book! 99% of the staff is super friendly! Seating can get pretty tight and wait times are usually never what they say. They told us 40 min and we waited 15 min then had a table. Big groups are hard to seat fast, but tables of two don't wait long! Bathroom can almost make you feel like you're on set for a horror movie( that's what my girlfriend says) so be prepared. Sushi never disappoints and if you only get one roll, definitely get the Oh My God, more for the experience that comes with it!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.... my only real complaint was there was a heavy smell of grease frying for the tempura dishes, which was unappealing."}
{"text":"First Impressions: Harumi sushi leaves much to the imagination when first arriving. It is located in a downtown Phoenix. Hard to tell what to expect on a first visit. Upon entering one is greeted with a cozy, intimate setting. Decorations are appropriate and unobtrusive. Very clean.

Service: Professional appearance and very kind.

Food: Excellent. sushi tastes fresh and there is a wide variety. \"Omakase\" and \"O my God\" is the best I have ever tried.  Rolls are made with attention to detail and are presented beautifully.  Best! Best! Best! sushi restaurant in the Phoenix downtown area. 

Price: Prices reasonable. Eat here if you crave high quality sushi and rolls.

Final impressions: This restaurant is a real diamond in the rough. This will quickly become one of your favorite places to eat. I strongly recommend calling ahead to set up a reservation, because if you go there without one during busy times you will wait for up to 45 minutes for a seat. Always very busy, which is a good sign for a restaurant. 

Rating Breakdown: Five stars easily. Top notch food. Fast, friendly, and attentive staff. This is how a sushi restaurant is supposed to look and taste. Other five star reviews are accurate. Be prepared to add a new favorite to your list.."}
{"text":"umm peeps in phoenix obviously have bad taste in sushi.  this was a boring joint w no sushi bar.  no special fishies. fish out of a bag, run of the mill joint.  the omakase was like rice with some fish.  oh well.  this is a quick hot place w a lack of character or ingenuity."}
{"text":"Started off waiting for 10 minutes to just get our drinks but hey they were busy I guess. The sushi wasn't the best I've ever had... But the environment was pretty cool. The Mochi ice cream was amazing."}
{"text":"I lived in NY for years and have eaten sushi around the world and found this to be excellent. Owners are so friendly and even gave a gratis extra piece. Where can you say that about another sushi place?!"}
{"text":"I already had my favorite sushi joint pegged, but one taste of a roll at this restaurant and I knew I had a new favorite. The rolls are absolutely delicious: fresh and flavorful. The sushi chefs are so friendly and came to check on how we were enjoying things (always appreciated), and our waitress was so sweet and attentive. I will be back, not only for myself, but to share a piece of heaven with my family and friends."}
{"text":"Not a big place.  No reservations for lunch but not needed anyway. The Oasis roll was unique wrapped in cucumber.  Very refreshing in a hot city.  Overall a great stop if you are staying in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazingly fast service, fresh and I mean fresh sushi, real wasabi, black rice rolls, and it was packed as soon as we walked in not one seat available but with in 2 mins mins we still got a seat and as I said served quickly and can't deny the amazing-ness all around!! 5 star no doubt!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after ramen shop next door was closed. Was pleasantly surprised by the high rating it had so gave it a try. Lunch specials were generous portions and a decent price too. Rolls are pretty large in size too along with the cuts of nigiri. Fish was very fresh. Had to take leftovers home and I usually never do that but couldn't finish everything. The rice is purple but don't let it fool you. It still taste the exact same but adds a nice signature touch to their way of doing sushi. They also have grab and go sushi premade for those busy and on the go. Would definitely recommend and eat here again."}
{"text":"I have to say, my weakness is sushi and I have eaten a lot in many places....
Tonight Tina and I came to Harumi sushi in Phoenix Arizona and I feel like I have died and gone to heaven!!!  Amazing food. First time I ate black rise! Wow. Food was light and delicious, fish sweet and service outstanding!!  Chef and owner sexy Juno made us an unforgettable meal!!  Thank you"}
{"text":"YUM! One of my favorite sushi spots in Phoenix. The forbidden rice is such a fun twist and apparently better for your health. Our favorite roll is the one that has spicy Tuna and jalapeño! My mouth is watering just thinking I'm about it!"}
{"text":"Garbage garbage garbage. We came to this restaurant and put down our names; we were hungry, but we could last the 15-25 min wait. 40 minutes later, we went to check on the status of our seat. We found that our name had been crossed off their list.

Having been appolagized to and told it would be only 15 more minutes, we settled in to wait a bit longer. After 25 minutes of hearing nothing from the staff, we went to investigate again. We were told they were closing. They wouldn't seat us.

Incompetent and infuriating, the staff wasted our time, and by the time they were done fucking us, other restaurants nearby were closed. Why isn't there an option for zero stars? That's what we got from Harumi."}
{"text":"I love their purple rice for sushi rolls. It's chewy but soft. It's not too mushy either. Nothing's worst than mushy rice and not so good fish. Speaking of, I ordered spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna roll. In both rolls, the fish were mashed up. Why!? Please leave it in one piece, literally, so we can actually  have the experience of eating. When it's all mashed up, the texture is like food that's been chewed up and spat out. That should be the golden rule for any sushi restaurant. 'Don't convert fish into mashed potatoes!' Lastly, I got the seaweed salad. Mediocre. 
Verdict: wouldn't be dying to go back but if I have to, I would try something else."}
{"text":"I thought this place was mediocre at best...this is the first time that Yelp has steered us wrong...not great...clean and nice staff but sushi was disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food and a quaint feel to the place. The use of the purple rice was a really cool touch. I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a decently priced lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and me went there while on a stay-cation in downtown. We ordered the California, Spicy Tuna, and Spicy Salmon rolls. It was very good and the price was affordable. We miss \"How do you roll,\" so this is our next resort."}
{"text":"Wow!!!
First visit.  Really impressed with the rolls, sashimi & Nagiri.
Great meal, get here before 7pm as it got very busy. 
Loved the food wait staff and atmosphere.
Definitely worth the trip and I am coming back."}
{"text":"I seriously LOVE this place, I am writing this CRAVING the AHI Tower again!  Just wishing for another location soon!  But worth the trip!  :)"}
{"text":"This was great sushi. I highly recommend this spot. It is worth the very long wait. It is a small restaurant but such a great addition to our growing downtown array of restaurants. Downtown Phoenix is very exciting right now and this restaurant adds to it."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!!! Moving to AZ from Florida I found it difficult to find sushi that doesn't suck. This place does not suck! I live in Tucson so this will be my new Phoenix noms for sure! It's so good! This place is super casual, the rice is purple,  and good luck finding that bathroom, it's like the dang labyrinth back there. My tip to you is ask for your spicy tuna extra spicy and don't forget to ask for the real wasabi, you won't be let down! Oh and they close from 2-5 but after 5 the parking is free on the road! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Salmon Special is out of the this world and the black rice gives Harumi a distinct advantage when comparing sushi spots around town.  I give Harumi a \"Must Eat\" rating!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Phoenix. There has not been a roll that I've tried that I do not like! Everything is fresh and made to order. Friendly staff, MUST TRY kind of a place."}
{"text":"Good lunch specials. To-go pre-made roles for those wanting a quick bite to eat. Has a decent selection of Japanese beers. Price is moderate but the fish is some of the best I've personally had in Phoenix. The staff is very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"The only sushi joint I recommend when people tell me where they should eat in Phoenix. The menu is lean compared to others but I never grow tired of it! Will continue to frequent this place when I'm craving sushi. 

Thank you Juno for your talent and passion for making delicious sushi in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was incredible! Fresh fish and tasty unique combinations. The black rice is also a unique addition. The atmosphere is very typical to downtown Phoenix and has a hipster vibe. It was very busy when we arrived and took a little while to be seated. But the service was quick and attentive. The server was helpful with beer selections. The card reader was down so that created some issues, and they really rushed us out of there at closing time... I've never had that happen before. I understand they want to leave at their suggested closing time but it was a little pushy in my opinion. In my defense, I was not aware that it was so close to closing time and I would not have chosen that venue had I known. However, it was only 9pm on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I looked at lots of reviews and decided on Harumi for dinner while in Phoenix.  Had the Rainbow Roll, OMG Roll, and some kind of spicy roll with jalapeno the server recommended.  I rate this below average for sushi -- not sure how it stacks up in Phoenix.  

First, be aware the sushi is all made with Forbidden Rice (also known as black or purple rice).  It is supposed to be healthier.  However, it seems to have been the cause for sloppy rolls that failed to seal all the way around each roll.  It tasted fine, and is probably nice to have for the health benefit, but given a choice I would not choose this again.

Don't bother with the OMG roll.  They wrap it in tin foil and heat it over some burning alcohol or other, and it isn't really very tasty.  Just a muddled mess.

For flavor and freshness I give 2.5-3.0 stars
For presentation, I give 2 stars due to the fall-apart rolls
For creativity and presentation I give 2 stars.

The server was polite, but mostly disconnected and more interested in a book she was reading at the counter.  Also, I had to park in paid parking behind the restaurant -- not a big deal, but cost me $10 extra for the experience.  I could have certainly avoided this by going somewhere else.

I've had a ton of sushi, so I think this is a reasonably accurate review of Harumi."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Staff is fabulous and happy to greet you. This is an enjoyable place to eat in Downtown Phoenix. GREAT place to go for a quick lunch with your co-workers too!"}
{"text":"Service is something to fix still.
The food is grate!!! I'm really picky in Asian food, but I loved everything I ordered there. 
Definitely must try their rice beer and \"oh my god\" sushi. Presentation is very unusual :)."}
{"text":"Prices have gone up and quality of food has gone down, along with sizes of the sashimi cuts and sushi rolls. My last visit here was on Superbowl weekend. First we were told we couldn't be seated. About a 1/4 of the place had reserved placards but some reservations weren't until 30 minutes after. As we were about to leave, I guess the hostess changed her mind and pulled two tables together for my party of 6. I've been here many times and have never felt so rushed during a meal. This used to be my favorite sushi spot in Phoenix, but I left disappointed after taking out-of-town friends here. Oh, and I think they took off their check-in offer of miso soup and edamame."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in downtown Phoenix that never disappoints. Sushi is of the highest quality and the use of forbidden rice makes this place special. Add to the experience fast friendly service and one quickly realizes no need to think about another place to get sushi."}
{"text":"Very good, self serve style but quality of fish good. They use black rice and have a video about why it is better for you than brown. I had the spicy sashimi salad and it was amazing but a little spicy even for me, which is saying something. Not a place I would take a date. But great and fast for lunch."}
{"text":"This was pretty good, the service is kind of lacking and if you want to wash your hands you'll have to walk through a sketchy hall. However the sushi was good. I like the purple rice."}
{"text":"Not the best service if your alone. Not bad food, but not the best.  Maybe if they didn't forget my order I won't  be  writing this."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very reasonable priced copious lunch today...The lunch specials were reasonable  with. A good variety.  Service was good too!"}
{"text":"Whether you're grabbing a quick to-go lunch or an evening of drinks, rolls, and conversation this is the spot. Always delicious sushi, dumplings, and creative presentation.

The seating isn't the best but the sushi more than makes up for it. It's worth at least one visit."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm so glad my friends and I stop by this place! Came in and we were greeted very professionally and got seated right away. We had 2 servers taking care of us, Mary and another Asian lady. They were both very nice and sweet! We started ordering and when our sushi came out the rice was purple! I started thinking \"omg what the heck, it's not gonna be good.\" I was wrong! It was the best sushi I had so far! The rice was so soft and the tuna was so fresh. We also order Gyoza and those were pretty good. More sushi came out and let me say, they were all good! I love it here. The vibe is very nice and the decorations were very modern. Great service, fair price for sushi, I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Solid fish. Very friendly wait staff. 

The fish was very fresh. The omakase was a little salmon heavy. I'm used to there being more variety when ordering \"chef decides\" Omakase. But all was tasty.

Good choice for sushi in DT Phx!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about Harumi? By far my favorite place for sushi in the valley, the fish is always fresh and delicious. Perfect for a simple date night or casual dinner. 
The service is good and the food always comes out quick however there's usually a wait for a table around dinner time...definitely worth it though!
The prices aren't bad either, two of us left full (appetizer, 3 rolls and and order of sake and Kirin) for 60$
They have a grab and go section for lunch time too which is super convenient!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I kept it simple because sometimes simple is the best.  Rainbow Roll and Spicy Salmon Roll. Great flavors, texture, and presentation.  It was so good, I got another Rainbow Roll for the road."}
{"text":"A great drop in spot for sushi downtown . Had the oasis roll, H3, California, and tempura veggies, each was wonderful texting and definitely  will be back when downtown."}
{"text":"Unhappy server gave us attitude upon looking at our out of state IDs (carded for ordering alcohol). She then took a picture of my friend's license without asking permission. We were a party of five, and she said she could not split our check. Rather, we had to do it ourselves and write it down for her. It's not a big deal, but it was weird she would just refuse to write it down herself. I've waited on tables, and a party of five ordering one or two rolls each is not hard to keep straight. Just requires a little more effort. 

As for the restaurant itself, it doesn't really have much on the menu besides sushi, which is mostly rolls. I ordered the Philadelphia roll and requested seaweed on the outside rather than rice, but our server told us it would be an additional charge, which is bizarre since it's the same amount of food just flipped inside out. They also forgot my friend's roll and it took so long we almost cancelled it. For dessert, she brought us mochi instead of regular ice cream. Overall, mediocre food, but the waitress was a downer, acting like everything she did for us was a huge effort."}
{"text":"Sushi in Arizona? That was what I asked myself when I read all of the amazing reviews for this place. So I had to check it out. I was so happy I did! I ordered the Omikase and was delighted. The flavors, the quality, and the quantity were great. If I am back in Phoenix, I will for sure come back for more!"}
{"text":"It was the Saturday before Superbowl Sunday so the whole downtown area was chaotic. We decided to eat at this joint because the reviews were good and we were willing to wait a little bit for good sushi. 

Well I walked in and mind you no one else was waiting. There were two empty tables which could seat two. And imagine that we were a party of two.

I approached the hostess who had a panicked and disinterested look beset her face and she basically said we can't seat you sorry. I asked her how long the wait was, she said an hour then again said I can't seat you. I pointed at an empty table and two empty barstools on the outskirts of the room. She said no those are reserved. 

I get it. It's Superbowl weekend. But at least give me the courtesy of the option to wait for a table to open up.  It doesn't seem wise to turn down potentially good business --especially not one from the likes of me who would have ordered for 4 people and made them some money.

The scowl on the hostess's face and her demeanor-just unacceptable."}
{"text":"The food was very good, particularly the speciality rolls. They are quite big so be careful when ordering. We orders two specialty rolls and two regular ones and had tons of leftovers. Would have given five stars but the service wasn't so great. Would definitely go back though."}
{"text":"Seriously BEST sushi I have had!! Amazing and good service. We got the fried rice, spicy tuna roll and spicy crunch crab roll. SO good and in a great location right by our hotel."}
{"text":"My bf and I are only in town for the weekend and we found this gem.  I must say the customer service here was excellent.  The owner of the restaurant was hilarious and very attentive.  The staff was also very friendly!  On top of that the food was superb!! They have omakase for $35.  It's not the traditional omakase where they serve you each sushi one at a time.  It comes all at once on a platter.  Every piece was fresh and delightful!  What's unique about the sushi here is the black rice.  It's healthier and did not take away from the texture or taste!  I'm just blown away!!! We also ordered the blue fin combo (melts in your mouth). 

We also got to try what real wasabi tasted like.  Overall one of the best restaurant experience ever.  Brought me back to when I was in Japan. 

Last but not least the mochi was the cherry  on top! 

Wished they were located in NYC!"}
{"text":"In town for a meeting and decided to get a sushi fix near the convention center. Fast seating, fast service and one of the tastiest and most artful chirashi bowls I've ever had. Veggie tempura was crisp fresh and light. Really super meal!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi. Coming from LA and trying different sushi places, this place is affordable and you get a great amount of good sushi. We love the Vegas Roll (must try!) and the Philly Roll. Don't be afraid of the black rice, it tastes like regular rice just with a twist of color. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Oh My God Roll, Spicy Scallop Roll, H3 Roll and Las Vegas Roll were awesome!! So tasty! Great price for size of rolls."}
{"text":"I adore this resto, hands down the best sushi in metro Phoenix. I've had numerous rolls here for lunch, and one of my favorites is the OMG roll, it's served wrapped in foil and flaming! And yes, when it's served, you're like OMG! (insert valley girl reaction here) 

I'm a fan of the H3 roll which is spicy tuna, spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail, and the Ahi Tower too which is more a rice bowl of sorts. What I love about this place is that it's unique in that their sushi is made with purple or forbidden rice. So it's better than white rice, and brown rice too. It's pretty much a sushi resto with exceptions during the weekday lunch hour where they also serve bento boxes. The seafood is fresh, good eats, and a great experience!"}
{"text":"Blue fin combo is so good! A big slice of blue fin with 3 fat blue fin nigri and 4 pieces of chef chosen nigiri. I'd definitely come back. Good prices, good sushi, great service."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, we will for sure return! I found this gem on Yelp, always looking to try new sushi restaurants. My husband and I came here for dinner, we walked in and I became a little leery because we were the only ones in the place. We ordered yellow tail nigiri, gyoza, a shrimp tempura roll, salmon & tuna roll in rice paper, and a california roll with fresh tuna on top (I don't remember the actual names of the rolls). 

The meal started out with a complimentary cucumber salad, which was very good. Then we were brought out our order of gyoza which was a very generous portion with 8 dumplings (usually you get 6). After that we received our nigiri, which was nice and fresh tasting, and then the rest of our rolls that we had ordered. The chef had some extra yellow tail, so he made us a complimentary salad with it that included avocado and rice wine vinegar, it was fantastic! The fish was very fresh and flavorful, and the portions were very generous. We ordered too much and were stuffed by the end of the meal. We were however, able to fit in the complimentary mochi ice cream we were given. The service here was amazing, and we felt very welcomed. I would highly recommend Harumi Sushi!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot! Apparently I've been eating fake wasabi this whole time until I came here. If you want a stronger, fresher wasabi give it a shot. The fish are colorful and fresh and the purple rice complements the fish beautifully. The Oh My God Roll is a spectacle to behold and deliciously charred. A must try!"}
{"text":"They just sat there, staring at me. They somehow knew I would be vulnerable to their advances and lose my inhibition. They started to undress my curiosity. Layer by layer until I was naked with anticipation. I finally opened my mouth and experienced the biggest explosion of flavor. I felt dirty because I already have another restaurant I go to for sushi in the Bay Area. Always the Boy Scout, I lived for once and tried the H3 roll and sweet potato roll. Next time I play Never have I ever, I will speak of this encounter again and surprise everyone Around me."}
{"text":"Delicious! Warm greeting when you walk in and atmosphere.  I had the \"sex in the city\" and \"caterpillar\" roll. VERY tasty!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 6 months and it's always consistent... Always fresh... Always amazing.... Today was exceptional. Service is prompt and with the perfect amount of \"sass\" that makes you feel right at home!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the overall experience, but the sushi was average. it seemed to fall apart easily, thus making it difficult to eat. The dining area itself is small, but they are quick to get you in and out. There are not too many larger booths, which makes it difficult to accommodate a larger crowd. 

It is like an expedition to get to the restroom. You must pass through several doorways and hallways at which point you are pretty much lost somewhere in the back of the restaurant. 

Overall, i would go back im sure if a friend wanted to try it."}
{"text":"DEFINITELY was an AWESOME experience. I would highly recommend this place to everyone. Chef Juno and his staff greeted us right when we walked in. Juno was quick about getting us a table. We first ordered a large beer and a large hot sake which was shared between 3 of us. EVERYTHING we ordered was delish!! We ordered the OMG roll (YOU MUST HAVE) and a couple other dishes. We had one that the sushi was rolled in cucumber which was one of my other favorites. Chef Juno gave us ice cream mochi which was to die for. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Hands down Best Sushi Joint in Phoenix!!
The OMG roll and spicy Blue Fin roll are fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal for sushi. Having had some of the freshest, best sushi living in San Francisco I can honestly say this place is equal if not better in quality and service. The staff,  particularly the owner work to make your experience wonderful and your glass is never empty. Very decently priced rolls and appetizers.  We got the stuffed jalepeños and super crunch crab to start.  Omg... amazing.  For rolls we got the crab mania, spider roll and  OMG roll that they set aflame at your table to barbecue the eel. My boyfriend's fave was the crab mania roll (loaded and topped with delicious crab meat). From start to finish our food and overall experience here was top notch.  Definitely our new go-to sushi spot."}
{"text":"I dined here on a Wednesday night and it was busy. Sat at a seat at the window and the wait staff was very attentive the entire time I was there. Quick service and turn around time between ordering and receiving food. Asked for quail egg on top of my salmon roe but they did not have it. Good quality sushi for downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Atmosphere is not the greatest but i honestly dont care because the food was so good. I only came here because of awful service from squid ink- which was the best thing that ever happened to my sushi life. Purple rice was a bit intimidating but didnt care after my first taste. Give this place a chance, you will not regret."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant- very authentic Japanese food and service! Came here for lunch during the work week, and I was pleasantly surprised with the very quick service and friendly atmosphere. They have fantastic lunch specials- affordable and delicious. Food was fresh and very tasty. I will come here again, and I highlyrecommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Juno is the best thing about this place hands down. 

My girlfriend and I walked in and were immediately given the last two top. Juno joked with us for a while being very welcoming and gave us free sake even after we said no cause didn't want to impose, then later he checked on us and give us some edamame and miso soup on the House. Really made this experience wonderful! 

Sushi: is very good quality and excellent rice to fish ratio. Also very moist but not to the point were it falls apart, which can be an issue with some places if not dry. 

Price: specialty rolls averaged 10 - 13 dollars which is better then average for the area and AZ in general. Even had a bluefin tuna roll special for $10 

I have been eating sushi twice a week for years because my gf is Asian ;) and this place has some of the best quality you will find in AZ"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and from the outside we were unsure... however, once we sat down, ordered, and had our sushi given to us, we were taken by surprise. The sushi here is exceptional and very well presented. We got the omg roll and the Las Vegas roll! Great choices. I will definitely come again. We"}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing! The Vegas roll was a saucy delight and literally had me wanting more than I could eat!"}
{"text":"We come here almost every time we make a trip to Phoenix. It is the hands down freshest sushi in Arizona! We always order the shrimp tempura roll and Arizona roll. It is a smaller venue but definitely worth the wait when you have to."}
{"text":"Loved the sushi. The purple rice ( which is purple apparently because it is black grained before cooking) had a really nice taste and consistency. I picked a assorted box from the grab and go case by the register. Fresh and delicious. The sashimi fish tasted like it had just been caught."}
{"text":"Its not hard to find sushi in the Phoenix area though finding a locally based sushi spot is a bit tougher.  Finding local, high quality sushi?  Tougher still.  Finding local, high quality sushi at a reasonable price?  Yeah, good luck.  When people ask me for a recommendation for a good local sushi restaurant, the first place I always recommend is Hana.  A small comfortable neighborhood sushi spot with good product that won't totally crush your bank account.  Chain sushi places can deliver good sushi too, though often at a premium and in a fancy environment requiring requisite attire.  Well ladies and gentlemen, I didn't think I could recommend anything better than Hana.  Until today.

As I write this, Harumi Sushi is currently ranked as one of the top 10 highest rated restaurants in the Phoenix metro area on Yelp.  Seriously, check if you don't believe me.  There's five star reviews aplenty for this place even though they have almost no social media presence and no website.  I live just a half mile from Harumi so this place has been popping up on my radar for awhile.  Today I finally took the plunge.  The restaurant is fairly plain on the inside with a little bit of artwork around food prep area, but otherwise just simple tables and chairs.  Seats about 30-40 folks from what I could tell.  The owner (and head chef) Juno and the waitress on duty both greeted me and seated me immediately upon entering.

To start, I used the Yelp Check-in freebie for free miso soup and edamame.  Yes, they honor it and both dishes were excellent.  For the main course I was going to go with their staple, the Harumi roll.  The waitress gave me a look like \"that's all you're gonna eat?\" so I quickly sprung into action and got their Oh My God roll too.  Crisis averted.  First, the Harumi roll.  Shrimp, crab, purple rice, and avocado wrapped in tuna and topped with a spicy mayo blend.  Fantastic dish.  Rich flavors but not as heavy as I thought.  Next the Oh My God roll.  The first OMG about this roll is the presentation.  They bring out the roll wrapped in tin foil while the tin foil is on fire (I'm dead serious).  Don't worry, the waitress unwraps the foil for you, revealing a rainbow of colors.  Ingredients on this one include crab, shrimp, avocado, purple rice, eel, and tobiko (almost like a caviar) topped with eel sauce and that spicy mayo.  Oh My God yes.  Not overly spicy (though it does have some kick) and the two sauces smooth out the flavors perfectly.  The rolls were both huge (10 pieces each).  Somehow I had room (or motivation) for dessert so I decided to try some of their mango mochi ice cream.  Essentially a light mango rice cake with mango ice cream in the middle.  It came as four little bite sizes on the plate.  Clean, creamy, delicious and capped of the meal in spectacular fashion.

All together the free miso soup, free edamame, fountain drink, OMG roll, Harumi roll, mochi ice cream, and tax totaled $35.  I tipped the waitress $10 as she was super attentive and friendly the whole time (even though she scared me into ordering a second roll).  I enthusiastically thanked her and Juno for a wonderful meal.  Between the food, the service, and (most astonishingly) the price, Harumi sets itself apart from a saturated sushi industry in Phoenix.  I don't live next to major body of water, but Juno could've fooled me."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this cute  sushi restaurant. 

What to say? IT'S THE BEST. great price, GREAT service and deeelicious sushi :) PERFECT."}
{"text":"Coming from SoCal has its perks when it comes to fresh seafood. So when I moved to Arizona, I was sad to find that not many places have good quality fish. Enter Harumi Sushi to change my life forever.

My brother, sister in law, and our two friends made a reservation for 7:30 on a Friday and were seated right on the dot. When we arrived we noticed there was a bit of a line so it's a good precaution to ask for a reservation for a party of 3+. As we were seated, we were pleasantly seated by one of the waiters near the sushi bar. The restaurant can be a bit cramped so don't expect to have too much room when you have a party of 5. After being seated and being handed a menu, we decided on 6 plates: the OMG roll, omakase, oasis combo, and a few other rolls I honestly can't recall.

Being in Arizona, I've lowered my standards for sushi. However, I feel like even if I didn't lower my standards, Harumi Sushi would have knocked it out of the ballpark either way. Harumi sushi's quality in fish, portion size, and even price is on point. For five people, 6 plates, 2 beers, and a premium sake ($35) we were all full and our check came out to be ~$150 minus tip. 

Parking can be found on the street everywhere with a meter. 

Service is perfect. Very friendly and prompt. Chef Juno is the best! Always making sure everyone is happy!

TL;DR:
Harumi Sushi is my new standard for sushi. Best. Sushi. Ever. Our party left happy, and so did our tummies! All thanks to chef Juno!!!!!"}
{"text":"'m surprised this place hasn't taken off yet! Good price, great sushi, awesome staff. It's mostly awesome for the quick lunch. I just wish they had a website 1, but their hours will be better when they're open for dinner next week."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Best sushi I have had in Phoenix.  And its not even close.  Also, the chef is friendly and they only use black rice which tasts better than white or brown rice, and supposedly the healthiest.  I dont go to sushi anywhere else now."}
{"text":"The rolls are all amazing! Always fresh, and service is always great. Bathrooms are a trip to the back and a little sketchy, but just go before you get there."}
{"text":"The sushi was ok. Black rice was nothing to write home about, and it's not fun to swat away gnats when you are trying to enjoy lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Gets busy fast, so get there early, DEFINITELY worth the wait. Everything is super fresh, extremely flavorful and you leave VERY happy!!"}
{"text":"The Oh My God roll is a must here, the whole experience and service were great! The stuffed jalapenos were delicious you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Very good, and well worth the drive downtown for dinner- especially for the omakase, which has gotten me to try (and enjoy) new things.  We've settled into getting the Oasis roll, some sashimi, and an omakase to share and have been consistently happy.

Also just a nice place - not pretentious, you can be dressed up or dressed down and it's always comfortable"}
{"text":"Excellent sized portions, fresh flavor, and a super friendly staff. I am not used to this great treatment in San Francisco."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in a long time. The Ahi Tower lunch special was the perfect amount of food and offered a good variety of sushi. I will be returning to the Harumi Sushi"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time for lunch.  Very tasty!   About $17 for the H3 roll and a drink but the rolls are huge and I couldn't finish the whole thing.  If you're craving sushi someplace downtown, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have always eat sushi when and wherever city I travel to. This was a recommendation on Yelp and I'm very glad we came. Staff was wonderful and the sushi was excellent.  The rolls were even wrapped in purple rice instead of your white rice, which is suppose to be healthier.  I would definitely come back to this place when I visit AZ ."}
{"text":"black rice sushi..... finally. this place ROCKS! iam f. west coast and very picky sushi eater in AZ. Excellent.... !!"}
{"text":"A year after discovering this place, i love it even more. Juno (the owner) is the sweetest, and so is everyone that works here. Prices are affirdable and the sushi is Impeccable. 

My current favorites are the seared salmon nigiri, ahi tower and the omg roll. Harumi also has the best seaweed salad!"}
{"text":"Purple Rice!

You will not find a place better for omakase than at Harumi sushi. Omakase in Japanese means \"chefs choice\" in Japanese, which means that thce sushi chef gets to choose what he wishes to serve you. Usually this would cost at least $75 or more in other cities. Each piece of fish brought out was delicate, savory, and divine.

I also had the chance to try the nigiri combo plate which contains generous portion of delicious fish and a roll. Think that you will notice that it's different with the sushi joint is that they use purple rice, which adds special indescribable taste to any roll or nigiri. 

My only complaint would have to be that the service was a bit curt, and they seem to be more interested in turning over tables then providing customer service. Regardless I will be back to consume epic amounts of fish."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch at the recommendation of a co-worker. Great, fresh sushi at a great price! 

Each roll is wrapped in black rice (purple in color), which is a superfood, considered to be healthier than brown rice.  

I had the Tempura Shrimp Roll, which was solid. 
The chef came over and topped our meal off with a scoop of green tea ice cream. This was a welcome addition and appeased my sweet tooth. 

Definitely adding this place to our repertoire during the week!"}
{"text":"I looooove sushi. Ordered the sampler and some of the rolls looked like they were falling apart and in fact, they did. Purple rice was a cool touch - tougher than your usual sushi rice (reminded me of brown rice texture). Our sashimi appetizer sampler was pretty good and fresh! 

Ambience: Felt very welcomed when we first walked through the door. cute decor, cozy atmosphere.

Other: I am on the search for an inexpensive and fresh sushi place since I've moved back to Phoenix. I'd like to come back to try other rolls for sure! 

Obviously parking is not free since it's downtown, but it was very inexpensive. I paid $1.50 for one hour right around the corner."}
{"text":"First off, sushi isn't even my thing and I think this place is amazing!! Chef and maybe owner, is friendly and engaging. Menu is interesting and entertaining. I love their melon soda and green (matcha I think) tea. I'm a vegetarian and find plenty of options here. I love the veggie tempura!"}
{"text":"Such a pleasant surprise to find a great and affordable sushi place in downtown Phoenix. The rolls were all great, but I was particularly impressed with the sashimi. Extremely friendly and attentive wait staff. A small establishment with great food. They use black (purple once it is cooked) rice instead of white rice which is much better for you, and tastes fantastic. It adds a great texture to the rolls and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi at a great price with personal service from the owner - It doesn't get any better than this!  

My friend and I have been trying out different sushi places all over town, and stopped in for lunch at this relatively new spot.  We were welcomed with an enthusiastic traditional Japanese shouted welcome from the sushi chefs, and three steps through the door the hostess offered us a choice of two generous rolls from which to try a free sample.  We could barely emit muffled \"Mmmmm!'s\" with our mouths crammed full of the fresh, spicy, crunchy concoctions.  We were already delighted with this place!

I tried a Bento Box lunch.  With the Bento, you choose your rice (steamed or fried), your protein (I tried the tempura shrimp - YUM!) and your salad/veggies at the counter, then pay, go fill your fountain drink and sit.  By the time our butts hit the seats they were bringing my Bento Box with five steaming tempura shrimp sitting atop my selections.  Everything was fresh, hot, crisp and authentically seasoned (not the cheap, syrupy glop you get at mall food courts.)  It was more than I could possibly eat and it was only $8.

My friend's \"tower\" also came out impossibly quickly after we sat down, especially considering it looked like a work of art!  The good natured chef who prepared and served it turned out to be the owner, and WOW, what a nice guy!  He gave us the VIP treatment, joking around warmly with us, explaining that the tower was meant to be mixed before consuming it, (which seemed a real shame, given the obvious care and artistry that went into the presentation!) and whipping out two spoons he deconstructed it with flourish.  When my friend took the first bite, I thought she was going to break into a rendition of the famous \"When Harry Met Sally\" orgasm scene!  She insisted I try a bite and it was indeed fabulous.  

We were already over the moon, but the owner wasn't finished with us yet.  He insisted we sample one more of his creations - on the house!  He gave us a choice of salmon or tuna.  Out came two identical, absolutely gorgeous salmon-topped balls of purple rice, decorated with perfect slivers of chive and of course, wasabi and ginger.  When we tried these, we were floored.  Best salmon sashimi I have ever tasted in my 48 years of being a Japanese-American!  Melted in the mouth, seriously.  That fish was so tender, it is amazing it didn't just fall apart while swimming in the ocean!

But wait, there's more!  Despite the fact that such quality for such reasonable prices is already a great deal, from 2pm - 5pm everything goes on sale for half price!  WHAT?!?  No way!  I think I have to go get a downtown job so I can eat a late lunch daily at these bargain prices...and then I'll take home some more for dinner from the large variety of \"to go\" sushi in the take out case...and then I'll come back on October 7th when they extend their hours to start serving dinner!"}
{"text":"I flipping love this place. Such good sushi and at an affordable price which makes the sushi taste that much better!"}
{"text":"What an awesome surprise! Was in AZ. for less than a day and we took a chance.We were the winners on this one!"}
{"text":"I would have eaten lunch here, but they mis-managed the line at the door and I left after 10 minutes with no engagement from the restaurant staff."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI EVER... Omg you have to come in here... Chef Juno is amazing. Fresh wasabi... Need I say more? The fish is the best I have ever had. It literally melts in your mouth. My friend and I were given a teaser that was so good I decided to let them make me anything... The best surprise meal I've had. The veggie roll with sweet potato is amazing as well.."}
{"text":"My Favorite Sushi Place

I started this new job in downtown PHX and found this place to be the best and most unique sushi restaurant.  They have a wide variety of unique rolls, food comes fast and service is good. Our team normally goes out for team lunches at this place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went here with my friends on a Friday night and the food was killer! I haven't had sushi this spectacular in quite some time. My pals even stated that it was the best sushi they had ever had (and he's been to numerous countries). The only flaw of the place was the waitress who was inattentive and rarely came to check up on us (it was busy granted, but she seemed to visit other tables more often than our own). I still rate it a 5 star in light of her poor service."}
{"text":"I recommend their rolls over their bento box if you hit up this joint.  This is what people ordered the most.  They focus a lot on their rolls.  Unfortunately no noodles which is what I was craving."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Great price. Excellent service. Nice decor. I highly recommend Humari Sushi if you are downtown! They literally pulled me in off the street and I have been going back ever since!"}
{"text":"Third time here and will continue to come back!! The food is absolutely amazing! We brought our aunt and uncle this time. They loved it! They food is so fresh and tasteful. What we love most is the forbidden rice that Harumi wraps the sushi in instead of white rice. Harumi has become mine and my husbands Friday night dates!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a Monday night and here is the breakdown of my review:

Star 1: the food quality was pretty good. The plating was nice and the flavors were good.

Star 2: the service was great. We were seating pretty quickly and given adequate time to order and enough time to talk before getting our food.

Star 3: the atmosphere was nice; not my favorite atmosphere but still nice; it was cool how the cooks made the sushi out in the dining area.

Star 4: this is the I'm impressed star; I'm not much of a sushi guy because I don't like super potent fishy flavors, especially the flavor of seaweed, however, these flavors were almost nonexistent even when I had a huge chunk of seaweed in my mouth by itself. Everything tastes fresh.

I could not give this a 5th star because I was torn on whether or not it was worth the price. The crunchy crab roll was 7 dollars and that was a great price but the Arizona roll which had crab on it too and a few other ingredients was 12 dollars. I didn't think it should have been that much.

Overall a solid 4 star and a great sushi experience for not the biggest fan of sushi."}
{"text":"Was happy to find out there was no wait at 7pm on a Friday night.  Came here specifically because they used the purple Korean rice for their sushi rolls. I liked the appearance and taste of the rolls!  The purple rice was very soft but not sure if it really taste different than white rice.  I would need to try them side by side to tell any difference.  Best part was the fresh fish - definitely the freshest I've had in AZ.  The tuna was deep blood red and made me want it even though I don't usually go for tuna.  

Crazy Roll - my favorite roll.  Soft, fresh, with soy paper. The Crunchy Mango roll and H3 roll - good but tasted similar and had spicy mayo and eel sauce overkill. 
Spider roll - disappointed as crab pieces so small you can barely taste it.
Oasis roll - wrapped with cucumber and impossible to eat as a \"roll\" since it immediately falls apart. Taste only okay too.
Nigiri - salmon, tuna, and yellowtail all amazing and fresh 
Seared salmon nigiri - YUM!  Had a great smokey taste and was compliments of the chef!
Spicy scallop nigiri -  one large slice instead of mini scallops. Had fake crab on top (my pet peeve -__-).

Chef also gave our toddler a plate of rice, fake crab, whipped cream, avocado, and cucumber to enjoy.

Overall a good experience but wish they had yellowtail in their rolls. Will come back but order more sashimi vs rolls for the fresh fish."}
{"text":"The Sushi is good but the service is atrocious -- 40 minutes to get a bowl of miso soup. Worse, there is no soap and not even a dispenser in their restroom. Makes me wonder what their employees are using to wash their hand and what God awful disease I am going to catch after eating there."}
{"text":"Really good and creative sushi, can't complain about a thing. Staff was nice.  Ohhh my goooodddd!  If you order, you will know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice. Food came out quickly. I ordered the edamame, seaweed salad, and salmon sashimi. No sure why they ruined the salmon by putting some bitter green whatever it was on top which I had never seen before in my life (and I get a LOT of sushi). Otherwise the fish itself was fine. Edamame came out too hot and some edamame pieces were over steamed. Seaweed salad was standard. Can't speak for the sushi rolls since I didn't order any but it seems to be a popular place with lots of foot traffic."}
{"text":"I can't even tell you how many times I've been here. Any time someone from out of town visits me this is the very first place I suggest. Always. I bring everyone here, I cannot get enough of their sushi and it never ever gets old. The servers are so incredible sweet and the owner is AMAZING! They honestly make the best sushi in all of Phoenix, hands down. The best part is they don't use white rice. They use purple sticky rice which is healthier. Everything tastes so incredibly fresh I will forever keep coming back as much as possible as long as I'm in Phoenix!! I wish Harumi was all over the United States I love it way too much!"}
{"text":"Great fish, always fresh, always super tasty! The wife and I don't eat at any other sushi restaurant as long as we're within 83 miles of Harumi Sushi! The staff is super friendly and fun as well."}
{"text":"What a gem in downtown! We found parking a few blocks away and there was only about a 15 min wait for a Friday night for a party of two. Super tiny place with yummy food and reasonable prices.
My fav were the super nice ladies who worked TOGETHER so one will bring the drinks, another will bring the food, another will check on you, another will bring the check, etc.
Def worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best sushi and hospitality in town! This was our first time here and the sushi was amazing! Very good hostility always checking in and thanked us!"}
{"text":"Really great service, food, and location.

I got there a bit earlier than the time they open on a tuesday, and there were two other people walking up to the restaurant; they let us in and kindly sat us without any issue. They are right on Central, so you can access it from the rail system without driving into downtown; there are two convenient stops so the walk is not far from the rail.

I ordered a miso soup and the sushi combo with nigiri and a crazy roll. The soup was excellent and full of vegetables.

The fish was exceptional, and the wasabi sauce they have is so good. I have never had a wasabi sauce like they offer. The nigiri was a good sized cut atop the rice, and the roll was stuffed full, and very flavorful without any condiments.

The ginger was really good and maybe the best ginger offered at any sushi restaurant I've eaten at."}
{"text":"We have been intrigued by Harumi Sushi as this restaurant resides in our building, it is always crowded and the reviews are amazing...so we decided to try it out!  I actually don't eat sushi, but thought they served teriyaki chicken (I guess they used to, but no more - bummer).  I ended up ordering edamame and potstickers (wish they were steamed instead of fried) and both of them were quite good.  My husband ordered a variety of sushi and was very impressed - great value and quality of fish.  He'll definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"First time going. Patiently waited in line. Then a Caucasian family comes in skips everyone to be seated. 

It was obvious that he knew the host. Because they were very friendly. He got noticed immediately. So he got seated immediately. 

Seems a little unjustified. But, we decided to leave."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for dinner on a Saturday. They told us it would be about a 15min wait and seated us at the bar. We told the waiter to put our name on a list for the next table. As we waited 3 people came up asking for our order. They proceeded to seat 3 different couples at cake in after us. We left. Disappointed because we really wanted sushi."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing! H3 role with Srircha is on point, if you like spicy you've got to try it. Tempura anything is a good choice, really light and tasty tempura. Make a reservation to guarantee a good place to sit, small place but usually packed because of how good it is!"}
{"text":"Terrific Tuesday night at Harumis! I see why the reviews are so good. The sushi is delicious and beautiful. The staff is so friendly! The sushi chef made a special roll for our son, for free. We will definitely come back next time we are in downtown. So thankful for Yelp for helping us find gems like this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The portions are pretty big and reasonably priced.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a great price! Hands down the best place to buy affordable and unique sushi in downtown Phoenix. 
Not a sushi person? Their entree items are great as well."}
{"text":"THE BEST SUSHI IN PHOENIX!
I absolutely love this place, it's located in the heart of downtown and kind of hidden. 
It's a small but quaint spot with great sushi.
It's priced a little bit higher that the average sushi spot but I'll never complain because I get quality every time. The staff is always friendly and a big shout-out to the chefs! Keep kicking ass guys!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing prices, amazing service and amazing staff!!  I love sushi and am a sushi snob.  This place is fabulous in all areas.  Everyone needs to try it!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I've ever been to, and I don't say that lightly. 

The atmosphere was perfect. Just crowded enough to be loud, but not so much that it made you sit uncomfortably close to strangers. The lightning wasn't too bright or too dim, just right. 

The service was incredible. The rolls were all delicious. Try the combo order if you want to try three different rolls for $15. Amazing value.

If you're in PHX, you owe it to yourself to try this place."}
{"text":"Looked for a sushi place close to work. Great little place. The \"grab&go\" section has a great variety if you don't want to wait. Service is fast & friendly. Tried sushi this time & will definitely try the ramen next time. Go early to beat the business lunch crowd."}
{"text":"There is a reason for all the positive reviews of this place.  The sashimi was amazing and the service was perfect.  I am going to try and come back as many times as I can while I am in Phoenix for the next two days!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Rolls are really big. Love the uniqueness of the black rice, and how they have a video loop to educate you on why they use it instead of white rice. Friendly, quick, reasonably priced. Loved everything."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner and it was good but can't say I was blown away or amazed. The Las Vegas roll and Crunch Crab roll were amazing! Ahi Tower was also awesome except it was kinda messy. Spicy Scallop roll and Crazy roll was eh and the Spider roll was good but can use a tad more flavor. Gyoza dumplings are usually yummy and a good starter. Overall it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Simple.Tasty.Fresh. This is how I would describe Harumi Sushi. It's hard for me to fall in love with sushi here in the middle of the desert; but I was pretty wow'd by Harumi Sushi when we were here the other night. My favorite was a H3 Roll, ( ABSOLUTE favorite!) ; Black rice in a roll!!! Yes please. The spicy tuna; The salmon; and the OMG! Which is in foil and flamed and lit up at table. We over ordered , as we usually do from not being able to decide or simply wanting to sample so many different things. The servings here at Harumi are generous. It's probably best to not be like us and order as you consume! Every roll was fresh and came out to us fast. The  wait staff wow'd us with great, friendly service and from the kitchen they even seem to have a fun environment too. It's nice to dine in a place like that! Love the location but parking here is kind of a bear at times and another 'con' is the bathroom is in a weird place. Let's be honest, sushi in the desert is always 'weird' to someone or maybe anyone who lived in the Californ-I-A but this is legit and I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a Saturday night around 830-9PM and although there was a wait, it was fairly short and we were seated quickly. The restaurant itself isn't extremely big, but it's very cozy and I enjoyed the more intimate ambience. 

During our visit, we decided on the OMG roll, the Oasis roll, and the H3 roll. What's really neat about this restaurant is that they use purple rice and it definitely gives the place a different feel. I forgot exactly how the purple rice was created, but I believe it is supposed to be a healthier substitute, which I appreciate, and regardless of the different rice color, all the sushi tasted delicious! The OMG roll is definitely one any visitor must try because its presentation is really intriguing and entertaining. It comes out wrapped in aluminum foil lit on fire and it certainly enhances one's trip here. Not only that, but the flavor of the sushi is great and it was definitely my favorite choice amongst the 3. The other choices were also delicious though! Additionally, we got the toro nigiri and the toro melts in your mouth. We ended up getting green tea mochi ice cream for dessert as well, which was the perfect touch to end the meal. 

In addition to the food tasting great, the service was even more phenomenal. Right from the start, we felt greeted and wholeheartedly welcomed. Our server, the food runners, and I believe he was one of the owners of the restaurant (?) were all very kind, helpful, on top of things, and truly made our experience there nothing short of amazing.

If I'm ever in Phoenix, I'd definitely visit again. I like you, Harumi Sushi. I like you a lot."}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel around the block and wasn't feeling so well so I found this place on Yelp and walked over for a to go order. When I got back to my hotel and opened the bag I was pleasantly surprised. The rolls were so big they barely fit in the containers! Not to mention being super yummy! Got the Oh My Gosh roll and Harumi roll. Amazing!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, my wife and I decided to check out Harumi Sushi on a Saturday night: the reviews were spot on. It took us a while to find because google maps said it was on the North side of Adams, but its actually on the West side of Central. The restaurant itself is unassuming, but the food is amazing--fresh, creative, well presented, and delicious. Recommend the oasis roll and the las vegas roll in particular."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to give this place a 3 star review but from my point of view, it just wasn't that good. We came here last night, and were quickly seated on a decently busy Thursday evening. 

I had flipped through the pictures and saw the platter for two people for $35 and figure with that and some miso soup and seaweed salad we would be full and happy.

To start, the seaweed salad was really bad, like reallllllly bad. I tried it and could barely finish my bite because it was frozen. So that sucked. The miso came out really fast, and was okay. Nothing super special but, then the platter came out. At first glance it seemed like there was a lot of different kinds of fish, but then the server explained it and we had like 4 types of tuna, and the same yellowtail for sashimi in the rolls. There was also salmon both cooked with eel sauce and sashimi. It was all of fine quality but there just didn't wow me. 

I think the server was nice, I let her know about the seaweed salad and she took it off the bill. The fish was decent, but I just wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"Wow..had a team building event with some friends from work and this is the best sushi, I've had here in AZ.  It's not large place, and there's the purple rice. I don't know if the rice made the sushi taste better or not but all the tools we had were excellent, fresh tasting and great flavor. Only one thing, even tho it adds to the charm, small place, packed house, a lil slow on the service but not enough to take any stars away..well done."}
{"text":"3.5 is more accurate. Came here solo on a weekend night w/o making any prior reservations. Friendly & attentive service, was seated promptly with little waiting. Had the $25 omakase which consisted of variety of rolls (there was one that consisted of asparagus, imitation crab, and maraschino cherries wrapped in soy paper, and another with spicy lobster) and nigiri (salmon, tuna). All interesting flavors but nothing stood out - other than that I've never had sushi with maraschino cherries until then - it was strangely sweet and savory at the same time. I would normally expect higher quality for omakase and higher price but felt that $25 for the portions given was adequate."}
{"text":"Fast.  Delicious.  Cheap.  Great service.  Hidden gem of downtown phoenix.  They use black rice instead of white rice which is tasty and good for your digestive system.  Get the Oh My God roll and you will figure out multiple reasons why it ended up with that name.  Don't be basic and go to Squid Ink.   This place is right down the street."}
{"text":"Unimpressed with the food, service, environment, clientele and basically everything about the entire restaurant given the prices that they think they're entitled to charge. They seem like they're trying awfully hard to be Ra Sushi, when all they really are is a pretentious neighborhood seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"Easily the best in metro Phoenix, as big a fan as any fish lover could be of Hana on 7th near Missouri,  Harumi takes over the top spot  based on incredibly fresh fish served in generous portions at embarrassingly modest pricing. A Chirashi (sashimi fish and vegetables served over rice) at fifteen dollars? Please.  Two of us shared an Omakase (chef's choice meal) at $25.00 per person that was creative, deftly served, and more than abundant.  I actually asked the chef to stop sending over courses!

A mom-and-pop atmosphere that many prefer to the slicker, so-called hip versions, permeating the sushi landscape.  Fresh fish at good pricing with excellent service.  Keep it real and save the DJ's for the disco afterwards!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty fun casual little sushi place, easy to find if staying at a hotel downtown.
The menu is limited and seems that most rolls are variations of the same 4 or 5 ingredients.
The coolest thing is the purple wild rice they use. It's yummy and apparently much better for you than white rice.
The service was very speedy and friendly.
If we lived in PHX we would definitely return."}
{"text":"I previously gave Harumi a bad rating due to a bad customer service experience I had. But I've since had several good experiences and the food is just so good!"}
{"text":"It was good even the raw fish and I hate the raw fish. Purple rice was very good and different"}
{"text":"This place is going to be my go-to restaurant for sushi whenever I'm in Phoenix! My friend, son, and I came here for lunch. The restaurant was self-service, meaning you sat yourself down and ordered at the front, although you still take a menu with you when you sit down. For appetizers, we had edamame ($3) & miso soup ($1.50 each). For our main entree, we had the 6-piece nigiri, 6-sashimi, & 6-Oasis roll (tuna,  salmon, crab salad, and avocado wrapped in cucumber) sushi combo ($27). That combo was VERY WELL WORTH IT, considering the sashimi pieces were large and could be cut into two pieces (probably about the average size for other sushi places). 

The only part that confused me was the restroom set-up. It was like a maze lol!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with my friends. the service was amazing, the chef was really funny and totally made my birthday dinner that much more fun. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! Sat near Chef and he gave us the low down on all the dishes. Got the bluefin special and it was amazing. Arizona roll and Ahi tower were also excellent. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tasty and awesome presentation.  Unique find in downtown with the right mixture of fresh with cutting edge combo of black rice and off the boat ahi."}
{"text":"Trust the reviews! This place has by far the best sushi I've had in the valley. We had the H3 Roll, the Crazy Roll, a Spicy Tuna Roll and some salmon and yellowtail nigiri. Everything was so fresh and delicious I couldn't help but dance every time I took a bite. 

The servers were awesome and the black rice adds a fantastic flavor to the sushi. Highly recommend! Only downside, no parking and if there's an event at the Orpheum you really have to search for a spot."}
{"text":"Quite a while since i ate in Phoenix, felt like sushi so looked up a good place. This did not disappoint. The Omakase Special was incredibly good - Seared Salmon, Scallop nigiri, Toro, and blue fin tuna. Wow."}
{"text":"Wasn't able to eat here. The place was empty, maybe 3-4 full tables. We went as a group of five, from jury. Our waitress refused to write separate tickets because they were expecting to get busy later. I would understand in a packed house. We asked if we should go somewhere else or if they wanted our business, she then walked away from our table without saying a word. On the way out the door she had the audacity to thank us for coming and welcome us back next time. Will never go back. This place was the worst customer service I've seen. Would recommend Squid Ink on service alone, over this place. Try Squid Ink's surf and turf roll, amazing."}
{"text":"From the time you walk in you know you're going to have a good time. I'm thinking it was the owner immediately came up and greeted us and was joking around. I really enjoyed what was almost like a deconstructed spicy tuna roll. Really happy this place exists downtown.  If you're driving parking can be a bit of a pain."}
{"text":"Beautiful presentation and even better in terms of taste. The restaurant seems to be so popular in phoenix that we have arrived close to the end of service on a Wednesday and it was really packed. We were lucky to get a place since all tables were busy. It is not a huge restaurant, but it is very comfortable and staff is very friendly and helpful. Sashimis are absolutely spot on. 

My favourite dish was shrimp tempura roll. It's a tempura shrimp with crab salad, cucumber, avocado and eel sauce. It was absolutely delicious. A portion has 6 pieces and it costs only 7 dollars. Given how delicious it is for me it is a bargain. 

Another high point for me was the unfiltered sake. I have been to countless Japanese restaurants around the world, but never heard of it. Included in that selection of restaurants I have even been to a local Japanese restaurant managed by Japanese staff in London and never experienced such a delicious sake. For those who are not familiar, this type of sake looks white instead of clean as usually they look like. It is submitted to a simpler way of filtration, hence the different look. It is sweeter as opposed to the dry and stinger taste of filtered sake."}
{"text":"Great sushi and great service,  had the harumi roll spicy tuna and complimentary seared blue fin tuna.  Really good experience overall!"}
{"text":"I went to Harumi for my birthday; I was seeking an authentic Japanese experience considering I used to live there, ands miss Japan dearly. Harumi did not let me down. The moment I stepped foot into the joint, I felt so comfortable. The staff were using simple Japanese and seemed to appreciate when I complimented them in their language. The atmosphere is partially casual, but honestly, you can make a night at Harumi into any sort of occasion. I'd go there alone, dressed up for clubbing with my girls, or on an intimate date. It's really what you make of it. The food.... The rolls are incredible. You know when you go to sushi and it takes 15-20 minutes for your first plate to come out? Well, say goodbye to that poor service and even poorer quality of food. Before I could slip in another order, I had a steaming hot plate of gyoza at my fingertips, within 60 seconds of placing the order. I swear to you the potstickers were still sizzling. We tried the Harumi and the Oh My God rolls. Nothing beats the smoky essence permeating the tangy-fresh flavors of the OMG roll, which is set on fire at a table-side presentation. The signature Harumi roll is mild enough for finicky eaters, yet an adventurous roll for those who enjoy a great dollop of wasabi on their bite. I was lucky enough to sample the mochi green tea ice cream, which is palate-cleansing and as authentic of a dessert that I've encountered in the US. Give Harumi a shot!"}
{"text":"pros:
- affordable, high-quality sushi
- delicious black rice
- generous portions
- nice downtown location
- super fast for a sushi restaurant
- nice hostess
- easy parking

cons:
- weird back-of-the-restaurant bathroom

bottom line: fresh, unique, flavorful sushi at a great price.

out of the sushi places i've tried in the phoenix/tempe area, harumi takes the cake. their fish is consistently fresh, their rolls are extremely well thought out, and their service is lightning speed, all without breaking the bank. my favorites are the h3 roll, which has a nice jalapeño kick and is drenched in eel sauce; the dragon roll; and the spicy bluefin tuna roll (not on the menu, but you can specially request it). highly recommend this place for small celebratory occasions or dates."}
{"text":"I have been eating sushi a LONG TIME. This place was so wonderful. Great sushi! I strongly recommend eating here. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and efficient service - I tried takeaway without calling first, which ended up with me enjoying a drink at a table, and a good view of the chefs preparing my dishes. Gotta love sushi, the handywork is impressive.

Beautiful results and tasty too. I tried the rainbow with eel and avocado and a mountain of different rolls and sushi - and even some sashimi, guess I was in the hungry end of the scale. It was all superb, even the wasabi was fresher than usual! I love the black and purple wild rice, both visually and taste-wise! 

Price considering, this is as good as sushi gets."}
{"text":"I guess I shouldn't expect too much from a sushi place in the middle of a desert. I expected more given the number of good reviews.  

I had one of the fancier rolls and it was not much more than grocery store sushi.  Note I'm from Seattle though."}
{"text":"Found this cute little spot on YELP and the reviews don't lie. Food is fresh a and very good. Coming from Cali to compare, they are on it. Their rolls are large and they use a black rice, which is supposed to be healthier dor"}
{"text":"This place was excellent! I was in town for business and looked up several sushi places within walking distance of the convention center. I would definitely recommend this place. We got the edamame and miso soup, and then several rolls. I liked the option to do a \"sampler\" of different sushi rolls, essentially three 1/2 rolls so you can try numerous ones. Will visit any time I'm in town! Prices were very fair, and again everything tasted fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Why does this place have such good reviews?! Perhaps due to the lack of options downtown?? What a waste of a drive downtown! I always hate feeling like I wasted money on dinner. The sushi was all mediocre. The purple rice they use to distinguish themselves from other sushi joints was soggy and not flavorful. All the rolls we ordered were variations of the same...flavorless crab mix drizzled with varying amounts of spicy mayo. Super disappointing! Definitely will not be back :("}
{"text":"Rejected...!! :/ Walking in on a Friday eventing with 80% tables empty and they somehow didn't have a table for us. A group of 3 women walked in before us and got a table right away. No option to wait, just asked to leave. Don't know if we'll try to give this place a second try..."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and were in search of good sushi.
We were so happy to find this place . It's one of the best Japanese food I've had .
First off the black rice was a unique concept and they had it on tv to explain the Benefits of black rice . 
We ordered a chirashi bowl and loved the presentation .
The best part was that it had real wasabi .Ive actually never had real wasabi before.
Chirashi was so good we ordered 2.
We ordered Gyoza. The dipping sauce was very tasty and the outer skin on the Gyoza was tender and delicious .
We also ordered two rolls , shrimp tempura roll 
The ambience was nice and we were lucky to come right when it opened at 5 because as we ate it became busy fast .the waitress's was also super nice and helpful.
I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I live in Los Angeles, home to some great, authentic, traditional sushi. This may be my favorite sushi place. The ambience is nothing to get excited about, but the sushi is! The chefs serve very high quality fish. This is my destination for high quality sushi."}
{"text":"UUGGHHH. You yelp-trolls with broken taste buds got me again, sending me to this 'oh so amazing', 'must try' 'favorite' sushi place. 

What. Is. WRONG with you people?? 

It would be generous to say their sushi was average. It was not freshly made. They serve nasty phoenix tap water, and tea made with nasty phoenix tap water. They tried to make their tempura sauce into something crazy and fancy and it just comes out tasting like it was inspired by spam. 

An all around fail. Thank you once again, yelpers for fooling me into thinking you could actually recognize good food."}
{"text":"I ate At this restaurant over the weekend with a few friends. We order a few different rolls, udon noodles, edamame, and dumplings. The food was excellent and the service was great! We will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT sushi!!!!! Fast service, super friendly and extremely delicious!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really picky when it comes to sushi, I was more than a little suspect when we walked in at 8 pm last night and the place was empty. 

The entire staff was there to help, with one gentleman in particular, who I think owned the place, was super nice and very helpful.

We started out with the stuffed jalepeno and shrimp tempura. Holy heck (insert other four letter word here). The jalepeno was actually a fresh, crunchy jalepeno! The tempura came out too hot to eat! IT WAS SO DAMN GOOD! Seriously!

Moving on, we ordered the arizona roll and the harumi roll. I haven't had fresher fish anywhere other than Hawaii. I'm kind of a fish snob, and I fully endorse this place. The rolls are made with black rice, which is much more nutrient-friendly than white, and also cooks to purple, adding a lovely spin to the sushi, as well as adding a slight crunch.

For two people, we ordered a beer, a hot sake, two appetizers and two rolls (that were the size of skinny burritos) and the total came to just under $50. This is do moderately priced I couldn't even believe it! 

I could not recommend this place more, this place is going to be my regular go-to for to-go from here on out.....GO THERE RIGHT NOW!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in Phoenix metro area.  I am a sushi lover and I have tried many sushi places. Their sushi grade fish is first rate.  You can see the chef prepare a whole fish.

Try the blue fin tuna combo or yellow tail sashimi. I also like the chirashi bowl.  If you are not much of a sushi eater, the Las Vegas roll will be a good choice.

The people are friendly. For evening dining, call for reservation.  The place gets packed."}
{"text":"Quick service, amazing sushi rolls, very amiable staff, great owner. The fish tastes fresh and so do the ingredients. Like this place."}
{"text":"I'm a super fan of Harumi Sushi! Came here with a friend over the weekend and was SO impressed. Not only is the fish quality good (which I've come to find is rare in AZ), but the wide selection of roles is wide and they come in generous portions!!!!

I was a little worried that the black rice that they use exclusively would be too heavy and texture-y like brown rice but was pleasantly surprised. Everything was so tasty and the service was fast/friendly. 

Will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Sushi is my favorite food and I've frequented many sushi restaurants around the world. I'm also quite knowledgeable about the subject having done a research paper on the topic and have educated many of my friends. Now, the point of this isn't to be conceited but to give context when I say this is one of my favorite sushi spots. Five stars, hands down, and I'm a harsh critic.

I was in downtown Phoenix for business recently and ended up stopping here during lunch one day due to the great reviews. When I showed up, the line was out the door and I knew I had made a good choice. I was a little put off by the order at the counter style of service as most sushi restaurants offer table side service but that didn't deter me.

My colleague and I got up to the front and ordered the sashimi combo with oasis roll, harumph roll, sex and the city roll, veggie tempura appetizer, miso soup, and green tea mochi. Looking back, that was way too much food, but so worth it.

The sashimi combo was amazing. The cuts of fish were thick and incredibly fresh and included salmon, tuna, yellowfin and ahi. All were equally tasty. In addition, the sashimi was topped with a small dollop of what tasted and looked like green onions mixed with wasabi. It added a whole new dimension to the fish that was very inventive. The oasis roll was also well made and fresh, especially as it is wrapped in thin sliced cucumber and had no rice. Perfect amount of sauce topped the roll and was a good companion to the sashimi.

The harumi roll was a bit intimidating at first as it uses purple rice. It made the coloring look a bit strange but it tasted amazing. Again, perfect combination of ingredients that came together into a monster roll. The sex and the city roll was also quite good but not nearly as good as the rest of the order.

After we finished we realized our appetizers had never come out. Upon mentioning it to the sushi chefs, they realized they had forgotten and immediately brought them out. We were already stuffed at that point but the veggie tempura was nicely done with a fresh dipping sauce world's apart from the sickly sweet stuff you might find at other restaurants. Also, we were given extra vanilla mochi and green tea ice cream on the house as they had run out of the green tea.

Great service, amazing food, and perfect dining spot. It was so good we even went back the next day for lunch and had another great experience experience. I wish this were in my home city so I could go all the time!"}
{"text":"By far the best deal/quality per dollar spent for sushi in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love this place, the owner was born in Osaka Japan then later moved to Korea.

What makes this place special is his unique culinary fusion of J meets K.  I have never experienced anything even close. Harumi is likes the ... Roys of Sushi!

My wife is from Osaka and she agree's.
???????????????????????????

Most of the wait staff are from Japan which adds an authentic touch that is missing from most AZ sushi joints. 

They also offer Asahi Super Dry from Japan in giant cans,  not that Canadian wanna-be bottled Asahi found everywhere else. Decent selection of cold Saki,  including the cloudy Nigori. Nice!

We ordered a double Omakase ... Oh- My- Goshi!  Words cannot to justice for the Sushi ... so here are some pictures.

While a more creative nighttime seating arrangement would add to the ambience, nothing is stopping us from coming back.

See you there!"}
{"text":"Love sushi and great service? ? Well this place is perfect for that.  Unpretentious,  delicious super relaxed atmosphere.  Went here for lunch after someone recommended it.  The to go boxes are yummy,  my fav was the purple looking roll with crunchy stuff on top of it.  We got complimentary soup, adamame and ice cream. The service was superb!"}
{"text":"It was 3 of us. We ordered O My God, 3 H and Arizona rolls. My son has noodle soup . Everything was very tasty. We will come again"}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix for the first time with my girlfriend and we wanted some quality Asian food. This place had great reviews on Yelp and was very close to our hotel downtown so we gave it a try. The restaurant was crowded when we arrived so we had a quick wait of about 5 minutes until we were seated. Until looking at the menu, we were unaware that the restaurant was strictly a sushi bar. We were interested in also having some fried rice and hibachi but I guess this was our fault for doing thorough enough research. (They do serve bento boxes with cooked dishes for lunch). We ordered the shrimp tempura app and the seaweed salad. Both of which were really good. I then ordered the ahi tower which blew my mind. The purple rice was a unique touch. I loved how the ingredients weren't packed into the typical sushi roll and instead were piled on top of each other in a bowl. It allowed us to take the perfect bite every time. The presentation was great and the tuna was probably the best quality that I ever ate. Our server was super friendly and didn't mind any of our special requests. Overall, I give Harumi Sushi 2 thumbs up and would definitely recommend this spot to a fellow sushi lover."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located at the heart of downtown Phoenix. Its a nice little area to walk around before or after dinner. Plenty of parking around the area (mostly metered or paid parking). 

Pretty decent sushi, cute place for a date night. Kinda small restaurant so expect to have to wait a little bit. 

Their black rice sushi is pretty interesting and it taste no different than the regular ones. It's always nice to feel like you're eating healthier haha. The sashimi quality is slightly below what I normally have at LA, but given that it's in Phoenix I think it's pretty good already. 

Very fast service, food came out 5 minutes after we ordered and we also got a complimentary side of seaweed salad (decently big portions for free seaweed salad). Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"We tried this place based on Yelp reviews. It was pretty busy over lunch hour with most taking food away. We ordered an oasis role, sashimi and a spicy salmon role. The food was simply outstanding. I don't give 5 stars all that easily but the food was so good that they deserve every one of them. The place isn't fancy by any means and service is at the counter over lunch but soon forgotten once we started eating."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good sushi stop on a work trip to Phoenix, and let me tell you, over 800 reviews didn't lie! This was a very good sushi spot, fish was awesome, seaweed salad was delicious, and pricing was reasonable. Would stop here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Oh myyyyyyy.

I'm originally from California, visiting from University of Chicago though. This place is probably the best sushi I have ever had in my lifetime! 

Chef Juno came out and gave us some two free rolls and got engaged to my friend ;) 

This place is hilarious and soooooo good.

We got the Oh my god roll which everyone already raves about. The finding nemo was sooooooo good. Las Vegas, crunch crab roll, and California roll were also amazing! Everything was perfect. The sashimi my friends told me was super fresh.

My ultimate favorite was probably finding nemo! The tempura salmon inside is cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with the wifey and two of our very close friends, only steps away from the Westin Phoenix and the place is very welcoming.

Food: Pretty good and being a sushi self proclaimed aficionado I was impressed. Pure purple rise which I normally have when having Korean was their staple.

Ambiance: Casual and the staff were friendly.

Food Tidbit: Juno the head chef offers fresh wasabi on his sashimi - which caught us by surprise. 

If you happen to be in Downtown Phoenix, you won't be disappointed. 

Funny Tidbit: The restroom is farther away than you would expect, after a few doors and arrows - I laughed as the waitress said it was a mile away."}
{"text":"Well from 5 to 1 star!  Walked in, not busy at all.  I prefer having a small table rather than a high stool.  They told me \"sit there.\"  I asked for the location I wanted to sit at and I was told \"no\".  Keep in mind, the entire place was open and only needed to have a 30-45 minute lunch.  Was a fan and regular, but I told them not to worry about it I would go next door and eat and they watched me leave.  This place makes you quickly eat and move on.  Not good for a sushi place.  It's already hard to get to, parking is bad and the walk downtown isn't necessary easy.  Thai Basil was amazing, accomodating, and great food, actually better quality than Harumi."}
{"text":"My favorite go-to sushi place in Phoenix. They use purple rice (or called black rice) that adds color and flavor. I like to take my friends to this place when they visit. Also located in downtown phoenix."}
{"text":"Love this place! Weather you are eating in or even grabbing a roll to go hands down the best sushi place in Phoenix. Great location, parking can be a bit tricky if you are going for dinner but worth it. Working right next door, this has become my go to place to pick up a quick delicious lunch! Always fresh fish."}
{"text":"This rating is mainly for the guy with the glasses that took our order. Whenever I visit Phoenix, I always make time to visit Harumi. It's one of the best restaurants I've been to in PHX! But today, after not coming here for a month, I wanted my fix of some good ol sushi from Harumi. I was very excited and been looking forward to it after I landed. When I came in, I noticed it wasn't the regular people around (there was this very nice Korean lady that was always very sweet whenever I visited). Instead, I was greeted by this guy who sounded like he didn't want to be there. To make things worse, he couldn't get one of my friend's orders correct and had to repeat it several times. And now, we're still waiting for our food after some time and he has yet to check up on us. Sorry Harumi, I really liked you guys, but this was just awful customer service. You still make great sushi."}
{"text":"We've spent years looking for a superior sushi bar in Phoenix. Little did we know we'd find one right downtown. Catering to the work lunch crowd, it offers reasonable prices, and a wonderful evening out as well.

The atmosphere is casual, yet classy, trendy and modern. And yet, one can tell it is at heart a mom and pop operation, with authentic Japanese cuisine. 
We have yet to find a bad dish, but don't miss the Finding Nemo, nor the signature OMG roll--it's truly \"OMG!\"

Very reasonable prices for such a fantastic dining experience!

{"text":"It saddens me that I just now got around to trying Harumi, IT IS INCREDIBLE! It has to be the best sushi place I have ever had. It is right in the heart of downtown which makes it a really good place to go of you are looking to go out after hours or spend the day exploring. Also, it is a good place to go for showing friends around because they use purple rice for the sushi which is really cool looking and tasty. 

The rolls my friend and I ordered were REALLY big and full of flavor. Our favorite was the \"oh my god,\" which came with a little fire show! I was so pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. I would suggest trying to sit near the sushi chefs, they are hilarious. They made our experience really funny and entertaining. 

I only have great things to say about this place. The food, atmosphere, and employees make this place one of my favorite restaurants in AZ."}
{"text":"This place's black rice spin on our favorite rolls was a real treat.  The staff was beyond kind, and you could really tell that a lot of the other patrons were beloved regulars.  We sat next to the sushi bar, and one of the chefs handed us a giant sample of their Ahi Tuna Poke.  It was phenomenal.  The H3 roll and Shrimp Tempuras were our favorites, but everything we had was delightful."}
{"text":"One of the best unassuming sushi restaurants around! We stopped after a show and we were delighted by the unique rolls, fresh food and friendly service! A new favorite!"}
{"text":"I was initially pretty skeptical of this place. From the street, it didn't look like much. Fairly standard decor on the inside, wobbly table..

However, I am definitely really glad I came in. The warmth and energy of the staff really fill the place, and you just get the feeling when you're inside that everyone is happy and glad to see you. It's just a nice, inviting place to be.

The food itself was really pretty good. Right now they're giving out a lot of extra sides to try and advertise, which I think is great. So, I had miso soup, edamame, ramen with tempura, picked daikon and some california rolls. The ramen itself tasted like it was made with nongshim shin ramyun black label. That is not a slight mind you. I cook that regularly. It had enough extra things in it, big strips of mushrooms, vegetables, that it didn't feel like a rip at all, even though I knew pretty much where it came from. The tempura was top notch. Likewise, the california rolls were significantly better than what one normally expects, and I enjoyed eating them, for a change. Overall, would definitely go back. I'd love to sample more of their menu.

Update: Went back as promised, this time had the sashimi combo. The sashimi itself was great. The combo also comes with an oasis roll, which has cucumber strips on the outside instead of rice. It wasn't bad by any stretch, but I think I prefer the rice. I also tried out the plum ice cream, which wasn't on the menu yet, for dessert. I didn't expect a lot from it, but it turned out to be amazing. Would definitely recommend that!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch spot.  I found this place randomly while looking for something new and different for a downtown lunch.  This place is great to go for a quick sushi or bento lunch.  The service is quick and attentive.  I usually get the bento lunch special, which is a great value and very well apportioned... one could probably make two meals of it with a to-go-box.  

It's a bit off the beaten path from the main drag, but it offers one of the best lunch values of downtown.  They don't have a prime location or over the top decor, which allows them to give the lunchgoer a good value. The taste is excellent and the food is fresh and well prepared.  They are staffed well so there is hardly a wait even if it is busy.  I've noticed they play 90s music sometimes, which gives the place a quaint ambiance.  This has become one of my go-to spots downtown."}
{"text":"Ordered the mini sampler rolls. Very good. The black rice is a nice little thing that's different. Our server Jade was one of the coolest people ever and everybody was in a very good mood. Price point was amazing considering they wasn't happy hour or anything. Left very happy"}
{"text":"After placing an order, one single solitary plate of sushi arrived shortly. Then... We waited... We waited some more... And finally after waiting for 20 minutes for the rest of the food, our server came back to ask if we needed anything else or if we wanted the check... (What check? We only had one plate arrive. We've been waiting on the rest of the food.... my girlfriend does not eat raw fish and the only plate that arrived was nigiri that I ordered. 

What I found particularly annoying after the wait was that the server never apologized, never said sorry once. Instead, she proceeded to explain that in this type of situation, this is never the servers fault it's the kitchen's. I don't care whose fault it is, she should have apologized on their behalf, even if it's not her fault. 

I'm not the type of person to ask for it, but nothing was taken off the bill."}
{"text":"Wow this is place fantastic!  
First of all, it has great A/C to get you out of the AZ heat!  The staff is terrific and the sushi is top notch!  Everything is made to order and fresh and just delish. 
AND if you get the chance to come I highly suggest that you park downtown by the convention center so you can take one of those awesome bike carts. If anything, just go for the experience. So much fun!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times since we moved to the metro area. Every time we come here Ana has taken amazing care of us. The food is amazing. The OMG really is OMG so good! Make sure you come here will to wait 20 mins or so. I promise it worth the wait! Best sushi in the area. We will be customers for forever!"}
{"text":"The real banana. Don't be scared of the purple rice. This place is legit. Don't question my authority on sushi."}
{"text":"Great tasting sushi! Love the black rice mix they use for their sushi rice. Service was freaky fast (fastest I've seen in ages) even though the dining space was packed. I'm only taking away a star for the lack of ambiance and the very plain  and boring udon my friend ordered. This place is essentially all sushi, but they do it well. 

The service was also super super friendly. Plenty of greetings and smiles.  The owner or manager also makes it a point to come visit every table and ask how your meal was. Overall an excellent dining experience!"}
{"text":"First time here. Had the spicy tuna roll and the Stuffed Jalapeño. Delicious! Really attentive service and friendly staff, too."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow! 

Amazing sushi and sashimi. We order the salmon sashimi, gyoza, vegetable tempura, and the pick 3 sampler (we picked dynamite, Arizona, and Vegas rolls), a cup of miso soup. Everything tasted amazing!

Everything was fantastic, right down to the waitstaff. Everyone was super friendly and even accommodating to our 2 year old. The inside isn't grand by any means, but the food and service is exceptional."}
{"text":"I don't know why it has taken me so long to write a review! This is hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix! My friends/boyfriend have been here numerous times. The food is awesome and always taste fresh! The staff is friendly and the service is efficient and quick! My boyfriend introduced me the the Las Vegas roll and I just can't get enough of it! I honestly have enjoyed most of the sushi rolls I've tried!"}
{"text":"I visited Harumi by recommendation from a friend.  We went for happy hour, which is a rarity for me to make it to a restaurant after work in time.  I read the Yelp reviews after my visit.  They're pretty much spot on.  Purple rice and the rolls being drowned in sauce are all that sets Harumi apart from any other sushi joint.  Very low price point, which is excellent.  Paid parking, but it's downtown, so that is to be expected."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and real wasabi.  Went for lunch and wasn't hungry at dinner.  Mochi was a little too melted but still tasty.  Great sushi in the desert."}
{"text":"Good service. A bit pricey. Came here during lunch I had a California roll and tempura. I was unsure about the sushi rice. It was purple and black rice! It was good. I love it! I didn't get to finish my tempura. I only had one of the tempura! It was delicious! The only thing puzzled about was there was no tempura sauce. It would have been good!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets food was so good ,staff was great.We got in pretty fast on a Saturday night in downtown Phx.Our food came really quick,has a good friendly atmosphere.i will definitely come back."}
{"text":"So damn good. Quick service , well price and extremely well priced creative rolls ! Loved it . Thank you to the staff ."}
{"text":"It is really a great place. The owner and cook are really creative on the sushi. We definitely would go again when we stay in Phoenix Downtown again."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for work and wanted some fresh sushi around my hotel. Thank god Yelp led me to this place cause it was amazing! The owner and the waitress were both SO friendly, food was fresh and delicious, and the price was great! I loved their purple rice and chilly-shaped wasabi lol I was there for dinner one night and ended up going back for lunch the next day! I will definitely come back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Oh. Em. Gee. I'm one for sashimi tuna and albacore, not tempura and/or California rolls. So perhaps the good reviews are for rolls that don't include fresh (uncooked) fish; ie. tempura, crab salad...even sides such as edamame, rice, miso soup, etc. 
So here is my review of the tuna and albacore sashimi: it was grayish, fishy, chewy, and coated with some sort of \"shine,\" and I still can't believe they actually served it. The freshie melts in your mouth and is never chewy . Those of you who have had this experience are already aware that grey/fishy/chewy sashimi is old! I am looking for a better quality sashimi place (nearby) if anyone has any advice...thank you in advance!"}
{"text":"The fresh wasabi is a rare treat.  That alone makes this place stand out.  The wild rice is distinctive too.  Nonetheless Harumi does not compare to restaurants in SF, LA or NY.   In the middle of the desert it's just not possible to get the variety of fresh fish like that's accessible by the ocean, and this is what makes for outstanding sushi.

The service is friendly and attentive.

Lowering expectations from a coastal town to the middle of Phoenix, the rating bumps up to four stars."}
{"text":"Sashimi was super fresh and rolls were gynormous! Service was great -- although they seem to be a tad shorthanded with the amount of business that was in there that night. 

We'll definitely be heading back."}
{"text":"The sushi was great! I totally recommend the bluefin toro! I had the omakase, sever suggestion, and mentioned that I like toro and got a lot of it! My favorite are the seared pieces! My only advice is, to make sure you really like sushi! The fish pieces are quite big and if you are the person that is ok but doesn't love it, you will be in trouble!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry fellow Yelpers but this place was terrible. First off I kept getting passed over for couples who arrived after me. I let it slide the 1st time but it about happened again and i had to say something. I was seated and ordered Edamame for a starter that never arrived.  I ordered my sushi and my drink and never saw the waitress again to fill my drink, nothing. I only finished 1/2 my 2 rolls which were terrible, paid my bill and left. There is FAR better quality Sushi in Phoenix. This place was just bad. Food, service, even the ambience lacked quality. Sorry people but this was terrible,  I would go somewhere else. I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"I hate to only give three stars, but the restaurant was way too hot!  ......I know, Phoenix in the summer time. Still, it was so warm inside!  We are talking about sushi!  We sat at the high table next to the window. There happened to be a floor fan right beside me which was not turned on. I turned it on!  The dumplings were delicious, and the avocado roll was good too!  The edamame was so over microwaved that the pod itself disintegrated in my mouth.  My husband ordered the yellowtail roll which was served warm room temperature. He did not eat it!  I ordered the sweet potato roll (very good!) and the Harumi roll (Delicious! Still could have been cooler temperature!). I really want to like this place!  They use healthy black/forbidden rice!  I will give it another try in late fall."}
{"text":"Food was unbelievable, and the staff was really nice too. They use black rice instead of white, because apparently it is healthier, and I have no complaints! Everything is well priced too. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place. However last Saturday night my boyfriend and I stopped in to this place in hopes to have dinner. Upon arrival the hostess/server told us that it shouldn't be more than an hour wait and that she could call us when a table opens up. This was not exactly the best thing to hear and felt like if that was the norm on a Saturday night than reservations should be recommended somewhere. Since we really really wanted to have the food, we gave her our number and left. After walking around the city we made our way back about 40 minutes later just to check in and see how much longer she thought it would be. When we came back in we just stood there and this other male finally came up to us and asked if we'd been helped. He sat us down and we filled out our menu. The server than came over, looked at our menu selections, and said the kitchen is closed, only sushi is served at dinner. Granted, I understand this is a sushi place and my boyfriend wanted sushi, however I wanted vegetable tempura and chicken teriyaki. Nowhere is it posted that the full menu is not served during the evenings. So after waiting all that time and having less than desirable service, we then find out I cannot order anything I wanted so we left. I am totally disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here for lunch while we were hanging out downtown. They have great lunch specials including two rolls, 3 potstickers, and a cup of miso soup. They have purple sticky rice, which at first I thought was dyed with beets or cabbage, but I learned is actually a rice native to Thailand, which is pretty cool. I'm not usually crazy about miso soup, but this was really good and flavorful. The potstickers were basic but a nice touch. I got a spicy tempura roll, and a tempura shrimp roll (2nd option on the lunch menu) which I thought were both delicious. I really want to go back and order off the full menu, because I watched some really interesting presentation with some of the other rolls. We also shared a bottle of sake. They were out of the cheap sake I asked for, but the server recommended a much nicer and stronger bottle that she gave me for a great price. Service was great, food and drinks came out quickly, and we really enjoyed our food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service!! Highly recommend this place!

The portions are large and the price is very fair for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"The best I've had in a long time. Casual, no real atmosphere place off Adams does everything right. We wanted a bit different so we tried 3 rolls. The HB3 ( I might have that wrong) was this kinda spicy avocado topped thing, great. The Oasis was cucumber wrapped something inside, great. Had to try their rainbow roll, great. The tip I can give is to get the sashimi app, which gives you 3 pieces of four fish for $13. It was plenty, instead of individual orders of sashimi. Prices were so reasonable, rolls are huge and so fresh looking and tasting. 2 small bottles of sake. $70. We thought it was great."}
{"text":"As a sushi lover, I could not pass up the chance to try something different. The purple rice was an eye catcher and turned out to be surprisingly good! Not as sweet as I have read on some reviews here but I did have someone in my party agree with that. The rice was super soft which was good enough for me. The quality of the fish which is most important to me was so surprisingly good and one of the best I have tried in Pheonix. I actually liked the fish in the rolls a lot. As for the nigiri, I'd say the quality of the fish was not quite there, with the exception of the scallops being really fresh and sweet. It can get crowded. It was a 45 min wait when we arrived so we opted for the take out instead which was pretty fast. The guy at the counter could use a little bit more emotion and be friendly though. Still a fun concept and I would definitely be back. Oh and keep in mind it is downtown, so parking can be tough."}
{"text":"I moved to the Phoenix area not too long ago and I am so glad I got to try out Harumi! The seaweed salad and stuffed jalapeños were great appetizers and the 3 rolls we got were delicious! On top of the great tasting food the service was amazing. Harumi will definitely be my go-to sushi place"}
{"text":"Would not ever set foot in this restaurant again. Server would not except yelp check in offer. Made me feel like I was trying to cheat them."}
{"text":"Great sushi, atmosphere, staff, and service.  Deducting one star for the purple rice, although I really wanted to love it.  It was just harder, maybe they could've made it a little more moist like the good japanese rice.  Definitely will go back.  Make sure to sit by the sushi bar, you get \"gifts\" from the chef ;-)"}
{"text":"Amazing downtown sushi. The 'oh my god' roll is tasty and served in an interesting way. Order and find out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here from out of town based on the previous other yelp reviews and they did not disappoint! The sushi was amazing!!!! 
The restaurant isn't fancy or anything but the food is SO good and the service is fast!"}
{"text":"If we ever go downtown we always find time to hit this place up for some amazing sushi and saki. It's always busy but don't be fooled, they know how to pump out volume. This is the best sushi in the area."}
{"text":"This place was close to where I was staying in downtown Phoenix and I was craving some sushi! 
I was dining alone so was seated quickly at the window but all the tables were seated on the Saturday night, they were quoting about 45mins-1hour wait. They don't have a picture menu which made it a little harder to visualize the rolls but I managed ok and got their Sashimi Sampler, Spicy Tuna Rolls and their Sampler which lets you pick 3 deluxe rolls and get about 4-6 pieces of each! I also asked if they could make me a salmon skin hand roll (not on their menu) and they accommodated! The rolls were pretty good and the sashimi was fresh. Their black rice is unique and super interesting - a first for me! 

The service was a bit slow, I was waiting almost 10 minutes between items and they forgot about my requested hand-roll, but the staff were very nice and I had a few different people check in on me which was great!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix. Their purple rice for their rolls in INCREDIBLE. Make reservations as this is a popular spot! So good and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Not the best ambiance, but great service that's attentive. Interesting that they use black rice. Threw me off at first but no different in taste. Portion sizes are very big, so order conservatively. Good sushi if you're downtown."}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate my beautifuls birthday and I'm glad I picked this place! The food was great, especially the Oasis roll...yummy! The environment is pretty laid back as well, it wasn't crowded as I'd expected being so close to the weekend, and we also found great parking just around the building in back.  Chef Juno was great, as well as the other chefs and staff. Chef Juno even gave us a roll to take home, in celebration of our birthday outing. We'll definitely be going here again  :-)"}
{"text":"This was recommended to me by the airport here. At first the service was kind of slow but once I sat down I was waited on right away. The food was absolutely superb and I would say it was probably one of the best Asian cuisine I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Might be the best Vegas Roll I've ever had! Super fresh, good service and everything we had was incredible!"}
{"text":"Came to visit Phoenix for the long weekend, and wanted to grab some decent Asian food in the area. Not too many places popped up, but Harumi Sushi showed up as one with beautiful pictures of sushi and interesting purple rice. Of course, I jump on it and introduce the option to my family. We arrived around 12:30 pm for lunch on a Monday (though President's Day). The place was busy, but we were next on the list. It didn't take that long to wait. 

We ordered a wide selection of items, and we had the chance to try them all. 

Spicy Sashimi Salad ($10): comes with tuna, salmon, crab, masago, lettuce, cucumber, avocado with Sriracha sauce, eel sauce, and tempura flakes. To my surprise, the salad was mostly comprised of sashimi. You get thick cuts that are marinated in sauce, which almost reminded me of poke. Slices of fish were thick and almost melt-in-your-mouth. I enjoyed the tempura flakes, as they gave the salad a crunch. You get a slight kick of spiciness too! Definitely recommend this! 

Tuna Sashimi ($12): comes with 8 pieces of nice and thick cuts of tuna. If you're a sashimi fan, this is a great option! However, I think that with the options you have, go for something that's more filling. The slices of fish that come with the other stuff are not lacking in comparison to the sashimi, so I think you get more bang for your buck with the other items.

H3 Roll ($13): comes with spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy yellowtail, avocado on top, cucumber, tobiko, masago, eel sauce, and spicy mayo. While this was one of the recommended on Yelp, I felt that this was slightly overpriced as compared to the other options you get on the menu. Flavors make it a solid roll, but there was not anything extremely special. It's not something I'd come back craving for though.

Mini Roll Combo ($15): this is a GREAT deal. I definitely recommend getting this. You basically get to try three different rolls, which is awesome. Choose from Rainbow, Dynamite, Las Vegas, Spider, Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Tuna, Crazy, Arizona, and Super Crunch Shrimp. I chose Dynamite, Las Vegas, and Arizona. 
- Dynamite: California roll with spicy tuna & jalapeño on top. Decent roll, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Great if you're a spicy tuna fan and like that on top.
- Las Vegas: fresh salmon, cream cheese, crab salad, jalapeño, avocado, eel sauce, and spicy mayo. This roll was absolutely amazing. GET IT. I loved how the roll was fried, which gave the roll an extra crunch that also powered up the inside of the roll with flavor. 
- Arizona: tempura, shrimp, crab salad, cream cheese, avocado, topped with spicy crab, eel sauce, and tempura flakes. Liked this roll, but in terms of standing out, it was okay. The spicy crab on top was interesting and unlike most rolls I've had, though it worked out well.

5 Nigiri + Crazy Roll ($16): basically, these get you lots of fish, and not so much rice. What I loved about it was exactly that. Thick cuts of fish, and extremely fresh and soft. Crazy Roll almost reminds me of a protein roll, but you do get some rice. Definitely the majority is fish though. Would recommend!

Had the chance to also try the spicy tuna roll, which was a solid one if you like spicy tuna. Comes at $6. I also took pictures of gyoza and the 6 Sashimi + Oasis Roll, but I didn't try them because they weren't what we ordered (it was someone else's that they accidentally brought to us). 

Would definitely bring someone here if I'm in the area. Parking may be a bit hard--you have to find street parking--but we had no problem finding a spot just a block down. Service may be a bit frantic, especially during peak hours, which was when they kept messing up orders. But once the storm died down, service was fine."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite restaurants in the country. I come to Phoenix a couple times a year and always look forward to coming here. The sake is affordable to drink plenty, the food is fantastic. I've never had a bad experience here and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"5 stars, nuff said! Just check this place out. Food and customer service was top notch. They're still taking people in and accepting new orders 5 mins till closing. Owner was so nice that he gave us free green tea ice cream for coming in. Sushi rolls looked and tasted fresh. Definitely coming back and supporting this local hub"}
{"text":"Very fresh food and inspiring dishes (like the tuna summer roll). Food is wonderful, and what makes it a memorable place (we are on a trip) is the friendly and welcoming people here. The generous and humours chef made our day!!"}
{"text":"I really really liked this place. The fish was fresh, the service was great and the manager came and checked in on us. The food was delicious and super cheap. The only reason they are getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that there was a construction going on in the back and they had a ton of noise going on. You couldn't hear the conversation over the noise, there was a guy painting the restroom so it made it kind of impossible to use the toilet since the door was open he has in there painting and there was no latch."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and it was very crowded. I understand that, but no one was seating customers so I stood in the doorway for 10 minutes -not a good start. Once I finally got a seat the service wasn't great. I saw my server three times - order, bring food, checkout. The lunch special is a lot of food. I got the Las Vegas roll, shrimp tempura roll, gyoza, and miso soup. It was fresh but I didn't think the sushi was very flavorful. It had size on its side but not as good as others I've tried."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place while wandering downtown and was so pleased that we found it. The sushi is delicious and the presentation is beautiful. They use purple rice as it's supposed to be healthier which adds novelty to an already delightful experience.  The owner and staff are extremely friendly and take great care to ensure satisfaction. The owner even gave us a hug as we left. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I can officially say that Harumi Sushi is my favorite sushi spot in the Valley!!! Great food and even better service/hospitality. Love Juno, he's the best :) We have become somewhat regulars at Harumi and would probably go every week if it was closer to us.  The \"Oh My God\" roll is a must try for everyone...yum! Can't wait to go back for our next sushi fix :)"}
{"text":"I have seen a few reviews that people don't like the rolls.  I get that, and that's why I always stick with sushi / hand rolls / sashimi.  If you do the same, you wont go wrong with Harumi, as the quality of the fish is what's important.

The quality of the sushi here is truly amazing!  I have only found 3 really good sushi restaurants in the Phoenix area, and Harumi is right up there at the top.  I ordered a few different hand rolls and each one was very fresh. 

I also ordered the Omakase (if you don't know what this is, try it.  It is the chef's choice and I loved all of it).

I will say this, the specialty rolls that I saw come out looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had. I eat only the veggie rolls because of my vegan diet. I am usually disappointed when friends choose sushi because my roll selection is lame. But Harumi did NOT disappoint. The rolls were huge and packed with fresh veggies. and so flavorful. My friends raved about their rolls. And the udon noodle soup was a huge hit!"}
{"text":"I haven't explored the whole menu but what I had today was delicious. I went in by myself because I had to try the forbidden rice in sushi. I thought it was an upcharge that you had to request but every roll comes with the wholesome purple sushi rice. I ordered the seaweed salad, miso soup, an H3 roll, and hot sake. All were magnificent. The service was amazing, almost everyone that worked there checked in on me without being intrusive. I will definitely try this place again. 

(I may give them a 5 after I've eaten there a couple more times)"}
{"text":"In town for work so I needed some place in downtown where I could have a light dinner. Reviews for this place were good so I walked over. I got a seat right away. I ordered several plates of sashimi and some sake. It was all pretty good though a bit pricey. The place is simple and tastes better than you would think by the looks of it. Not shady but not fancy. Good option for a sushi dinner."}
{"text":"Another great recommendation by my foodie colleague. Small sushi place in downtown. Went on the weekend and got a table for 5 after a 20 or so minute wait. Friendly staff. Great purple rice sushi and very fresh sashimi. Got their OMG roll as well and it was definitely worth a try. Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"Tried the Omakase for two. Fish is fresh, price is reasonable too at $35 pp, however I guess you get what you paid for -- only regular fish Nigiris are offered.  Your run of the mill salmon, tuna, hamachi, taka nigiris with salmon sashimi and tuna tataki.  Disappointed that I don't even get ikura sushi. $70 is leaning on the expensive side... Might try their rolls next time."}
{"text":"They were so friendly and inviting! I strongly recommend it for lunch or dinner. Sushi was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I was FINALLY able to get to Harumi, after it being on my list for months, thanks to my lady friend who decided to take me there for dinner before going to see Avenue Q at the Phoenix Theatre. I'm so glad she did! There is a distinct lack of really good sushi in Phoenix. Much of it is overrated and overpriced, or it's some chain restaurant. Harumi is neither.

We got the sushi sampler plate, that came with slightly smaller versions of three different rolls, the spicy tuna roll, and some yellowtail sashimi. For the sampler, we opted for the Crazy Roll, the Rainbow Roll, and the Vegas Roll. All three were excellent, but I think my favourite was the Crazy Roll. It had salmon, tuna, and avocado, was wrapped in soy paper instead of seaweed, and was topped with masago. I'm almost mad that I had to share it. The Vegas Roll was good, but fairly typical, as was the Rainbow Roll. The Spicy Tuna had enough kick to actually make it interesting. The sashimi was fresh and flavourfull. 

My only issue was that the rolls weren't sticking very well. They kept falling apart. It didn't affect the taste, obviously, but dealing with rolls that won't stay together can be a pain. I love the use of the purple rice! It added a little something extra that you don't usually see at other sushi places. 

The place is small, so make sure you time your visit right. As it's smack in the middle of downtown, it gets slammed at lunch during the week, as I understand. Dinner time on a Saturday wasn't too bad at all. No long lines, no long wait time. Our rolls were delivered pretty quick after we ordered them. 

Note: if you are not a fan of the owners of restaurants talking to you during your meal, be forewarned... the owners are very chatty! But they didn't really disrupt our date, which was good. 

I'm going to say that Harumi is definitely a) on my list to go back, soon, and b) the best sushi I've had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The sushi was great and they are worthy of their high praise.  I would give them 4.5 stars if that was an option.  They don't offer wine - just sake & beer which is fine by me, but my wife was hoping to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner.  The purple rice was unique and fun.  The fish was delicious as well.  Service was a little slow, but we went on a Saturday night - which is busy."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The staff is awesome and the sushi is so good! I wouldn't wear anything too fancy though, it's super casual and your clothes kinda smell like fish after haha but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, Chef Juno is a character! 

We tried the omakase (deal for $35), the squid was incredibly tender and buttery, the bluefin tuna was also soft and flavorful. The seared mackerel was also my favorite, smoky flavor, seared salmon was soft and melt in your mouth.

We also ordered scallop nigiri which was one of my favorites, buttery and soft. We ordered seared salmon and seared tuna, both fantastic.

The omg roll was a fiery show and also tasty-- great for my dad who wanted something cooked."}
{"text":"Crack!!!! This place was one of my most favorite recent finds. Firstly let me say that I had no idea that \"black rice\" had so much going for it. They do a good job of not only advertising the black rice which is the Restaurants \"concept\" ingredient; but also of having information on the screens inside about some of its many benefits. 

As far as the sushi goes I ordered the Rainbow roll, Las Vegas roll(highlight), caterpillar roll, philly roll, Phoenix roll, and Gyoza.... everything was great.  I should add that I tend to order the same type of rolls everywhere I go and by comparison this was one of he best sushi spots I have tried. The fact that they use the black rice instead made a bit of an impact in that I thought the flavors on the philly roll were slightly over powering(still good tho) compared to a philly roll with standard white rice.  

All and all I love concepts and this black rice with sushi concept was dead on. Can't wait to try this place again...service was great however their was a man who I'm guessing was the owner???...and he seemed to be very much so micro managing his staff. Yelling at them to do this or that from across the room. To the point that as a customer you noticed. Not okay bro!!!!! Other wise a nice small store front in down town Phoenix. Good food. Good Japanese beer. Great staff....except for that dude!!!!  Recommended."}
{"text":"Food was okay, service was poor. I prefer Hana Japanese eatery not to far from here."}
{"text":"I am a regular visitor at Kodo which is their sister restaurant. I just happened to be downtown when I stumbled upon this restaurant. After going inside, the obvious was great and we took a seat. I noticed at the chopsticks had the Kodo writing on it so I was very excited to learn that this is actually part of a restaurant group. I saw the owner wandering around he was really nice guy he came up and spoke to us. The food is excellent just like Kodo. They do the same thing with the purple rice. The fish was very fresh and delicious. The service was excellent and the food was incredible. I guess this was actually the original location. Awesome place will definitely go to it again when I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"They use black/forbidden rice which was pretty awesome. They had a special on toro which is unheard of but the way they cut it made it significantly less enjoyable.

However, they've fallen into the same \"put something spicy in every goddamn roll\" runt every sushi place in Arizona seems to have fallen into. Seriously, there were maybe 3 options without anything spicy in or on them? Even after we made it clear to our server that we didn't want anything with spice, our rolls came out COVERED in wasabi and the chef seemed annoyed we sent it back and literally just push the Wasabi off with a fork and handed it back. We couldn't eat more than one bite each but didn't want to have try and deal with their attitude for sending it back again. If you can't make a good roll without making it spicy, you're not a good sushi place. It's not like this in California.

No non-sushi options if you bring a friend that doesn't like sushi."}
{"text":"Bar none, the best sushi restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of eating at. Not a single complain. The service was fast, the sushi was fresh, and the atmosphere was amazing."}
{"text":"You know when you joke around leaving a sushi joint \"see you tomorrow!\"

I'm seriously not only coming tomorrow but 3 days straight

Trying to lose some weight I was either going to go big steak (low carb) or sashimi 

I only cared about low carbs and quite honestly wasn't expecting superb quality

Being Asian and used to the \"average\" sushi places throughout Southern California I wasn't expecting this delightful, fresh, flavorful surprise 

The dark red colors in the tuna attests to its freshness

Sashimi yellowtail was super fresh and to show how huge the slices were, my gorilla hand for reference 

Tuna tataki was buttery

Sashimi appetizer was big enough for a meal

The jalapeño poppers stuffed with crab were my cheats for tonight

Don't pass this place up

See you tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Purple rice on your sushi!! Yes purple so unique and it tastes delicious. They actually use black rice instead of white rice and i think it's a great idea. I'm glad i found this little spot in Downtown Phoenix. From what i saw it is only sushi so if you're not a sushi person just come prepared to not have the side dishes that typical spots have. However my friend that doesn't have sushi had the veggie rolls and she loved them! I had the Las Vegas roll and holy cow it was delicious. I can't wait to go back and try their other rolls"}
{"text":"OMFG. This is my favorite sushi in town. We brought family out of town here for lunch and they were pleased and extremely satisfied! We shared an array of rolls including the spicy tuna roll, spider roll, California, sexy crab, etc. Also enjoyed some miso soup, seaweed salad, and a couple of Kawabas (delicious Japanese kolsch style beer)! Not our first time here, and certainly not our last! Thanks to all the staff for creating a great experience for us!!!"}
{"text":"Went here to grab something quick and yummy for lunch.  Unfortunately, I think I came late because there wasn't a lot of selection from the grab-n-go prepared sushi area.  Still, it was pretty good and they were very nice.  I also very much like the black rice that they use, very unique and nice."}
{"text":"Was visiting from CA and found this place on yelp. I was very excited to try this place due to the very high reviews. Needless to say the quality of fish is great however, the customer service is awful. Thinking  the first time was a fluke and the fish being so good, I visited this restaurant twice while being in town for a week. 
  Our second visit was worse than our first. We arrived for lunch about fifteen minutes after they opened and was seated immediately. After we ordered a sashimi appetizer and twenty minutes later, I got up to ask how much longer. Turns out the waiter forgot to put in our order! With one other table with customers I was very disappointed. No \"I'm sorry or a complimentary soup\" either. We finally got our appetizer which was delicious but wouldn't go back. 
  I'm sure there are other sushi restaurants in AZ that are just as good of quality but with better customer service."}
{"text":"Thee must try sushi spot in downtown Phoenix hands down! Using authentic black rice to craft classic, and modern twist rolls, this really is a place to see. Beware, lunch hours are to accommodate the business crowd in downtown so offerings are pretty limited (mostly grab and go style) but for dinner Harumi's transforms into everything you want from a sushi restaurant. Check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner. They have ready made sushi for take-out which is really convenient for a quick lunch break. The sushi itself is quite interesting. They use black rice instead of the usual white rice which is a healthier alternative. I ordered a few rolls the first time for lunch, which was decent. However, it was my second visit for dinner that piqued my interest. I ordered the omakase ($35), which is the Chef's choice of sushi. This was a price of $40ish plus the hot tea I ordered (which came in a cute teapot). The food was good, but the service was even better. They're extremely friendly and just super. At the end of the meal, they gave a complimentary mochi dessert. I would definitely go again for the food and the people there."}
{"text":"*I am going to preface this with the fact that my friend and I went there during Phoenix Comicon*

Being from out of town, I was using yelp to find some sushi close to my hotel. After seeing the high rating, my friend and I decided to walk over. We saw that it was busy but not full so we had hope. 

Even though there was at least 4 open tables (5 including a reserved one), they were not seating anyone that had been waiting. The tables themselves hadn't been bussed yet. So patiently we wait, 25 minutes go by and they still aren't bussed and the line continues to grow. Being near the front, we decided to continue waiting. 

35 mins hit and we are seated along the front window. The table was still dirty... Another 10 goes by and we finally order our drinks. 10 mins later they arrive and we place our order. 20 mins later and that arrives. I order their pot stickers and they were tasty. I also got some tuna nigiri which was COVERED in this spicy bitter sauce. Yuck. Lastly I got spicy tuna rolls which were poorly put together and extremely loose. My friend got the Vegas roll which also were poorly constructed and covered in a spicy mayo. They also only tasted like pure jalapeño. They went unfinished. 

Also, the service was abysmal. I finished my water and never got to have it refilled in the hour and half long meal. My friend waited 25 mins to get a refill on a coke. Ugh. While busy, they didn't look short staffed or over filled. We saw them standing by the front a lot. 

All in all, I will never go back."}
{"text":"Definitely a wonderful place, people are super nice and food is even better. 
We came with a group of 6, and everyone love it!
Don't miss OMG, sex and the city's, ahi tower, H3. But everything was really really good.
We will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Visited phoenix first time and decided to visit this sushi restaurant based on others review. Definitely a good sushi restaurant. Quality tasting fish and not fishy at all. Portions are generous. I ordered 5 piece nigiri plate w/ roll and gf order spider crab roll. Highly recommend the nigiri plate for those who enjoy raw fish and dislike eating imitation crab/fried ingredients. The raw fish was served well thawed that it tasted creamy ( cuz we all sushi eater should know that raw fish must be frozen first to kill bacteria and thawed enough that you can taste the full texture and flavor of the fish w/o the fishy flavor). The servers were very attentive as well as the chef. He gave everyone a complimentary seared tuna and fried yellow fish tempura which was delicious. Experience was excellent and if I were to visit phoenix again I would definitely eat at this sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant on Monday and came back again on Wednesday. Some of the best sushi ever. Love the purple rice."}
{"text":"Holy s#it!! Wow! This place is as amazing as the many reviews would lead you to believe. You can't go wrong with anything, but here are some solid suggestions: Jalapeño popper appi, H3 roll and Bluefin combo."}
{"text":"Was in a hurry for lunch today and ordered a simple California roll to-go which ran me ~$5. The staff was friendly and made my order quickly. Sushi tasted great too! Really couldn't ask for much more."}
{"text":"After looking at the menu, I realized it was the same menu as Kode Sushi. And I confirmed it after asking the waitress. I decided to order the same lunch special as I had at Kode, and it was the same. I enjoyed the meal. A Las Vegas roll, Shrimp Tempura roll, miso soup and 3 gyozas for $10. For a quick cheap sushi meal, this is the place to go in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The first time I discovered this restaurant I was impressed. I have been a long time Sushi eater. And coming from the northwest the sushi I eat is pretty high standard. When we ordered the sushi we noticed that the rice was purple. That's because they use black rice. Which I was pretty impressed about. I have had almost every sushi roll that they have. And I am impressed by every single one. I love their edamame and seaweed salad as appetizers. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Been here for both lunch and dinner. Great rolls, very unique in that they use forbidden rice, which is really good. Favorite is the H3 roll for sure. They tend to be a little heavy handed with the sauce, but still a solid sushi place."}
{"text":"went to eat there on lunch break and it was amazing! i always order the las vegas roll at any sushi place i go and this was hands down the best i've had yet! fish was fresh and service was great :)"}
{"text":"This is my second time and this place is outstanding. The food there is no disagreement always retain the flavor and essence of the flavor. Always excellent service. Thanks Harumi Sushi recommended from 1 to 10. I'll give you a 10"}
{"text":"Purple rice?! Whaaaaaaaa?

Harumi Sushi is one of the newer treasures I've come to find in downtown Phoenix. The owner, \"Sexy Juno\", and his team serve up some of the best sushi I've had in Phoenix thus far.

I personally prefer the Crazy Roll and Sex and the City Roll - but honestly, I can't imagine that anything they serve that you might be eyeing would steer you wrong. And the purple rice..... not sure what it is that makes it so yum-o but it is super delicious.

I also LOVE that this place serves the real-deal-nasal-passage-clearing wasabi on their sushi pieces. If you haven't had the privilege of having the good stuff - and just that pasty green goop they serve at most other places, give it a whirl.... But it's not for the faint at heart (Harumi does have the other stuff too, just in case you're a wimp). Of course, a sake bomb or two could easily solve this problem for you.

The only gripe I have is I wish it was open later. Granted, nothing downtown is really open late enough when it comes to food, so it's not a big issue. But sometimes it would be nice to be able to pop in for a late night fix. I've seen they have some quick grab-n-go options throughout the day. So if you want a late night bite it might be worth grabbing one and popping it in the fridge at home for later.

Keep it up sexy Juno! You and your team rock!"}
{"text":"Not bad for sushi in the desert I suppose.  Perhaps I'm just spoiled back home.  Also, not a fan of the rice."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi, just a bit pricier than our other favorite hangout. Great location downtown if you're ok with parking and walking. I didn't love the fried rice, but everything else was great. The purple rice adds an interesting flavor and texture to all of the sushi, and I think we ordered about half the menu. There were some traditional dishes and some more unusual ones, but they were all good. Service was very friendly and quick, and we'll definitely be back the next time we are downtown."}
{"text":"Visited today for the first time, and was delighted by the fast service, delicious food and friendly staff. The place isn't big, but they use their space very well; there was no wait when we arrived. My friend and I sat next to the sushi counter and each ordered the udon / shrimp tempura roll lunch special. The rolls were so good they needed no soy sauce or other seasoning. We enjoyed watching a nearby table order the OMG Roll, which arrived flaming in tinfoil and was ceremoniously unwrapped by the server. The sushi chef gave us a complimentary order of seared salmon, a two-piece nibble which might be the tastiest thing I have eaten this week. I am definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Had a lunch here with some coworkers some of who have had their eye on this restaurant and had been wanting to try it. We went during a busy time of day so service was understandably slow. I had asked our server if they could make a spicy yellowtail roll in place of spicey tuna to which she said yes and scribbled something on our menu before taking it and giving our order to the chefs. When we were handed our sushi rolls I was given Spicey tuna instead of what I asked for, so I sat there waiting for a half hour before she had came by again and I brought it to her attention, she said okay and rushed off leaving the untouched roll at out table. 

About 20 minutes later another serve came by to check on how we were doing and I had brought it to his attention as well that my order was wrong, he apologized and took the plate to return with the correct order. After he had left and I had heard him talk to or original server about the mistake (it's a very small place and we were seated right by the counter) she came to the table with our menu and an attitude saying that I had marked blah blah and that if I wanted yellow tail that should have written it on the bottom of the page and how I was wrong, she then shoved the paper in my face saying \"see you marked this when you should've done this\" (mind you it wasn't my handwriting nor my coworkers and she was the one scribbling on our menu) so it took about another half our of waiting before I got the correct roll which was just okay. When we were finally done and went up to pay a different employee took about 15 minutes to split our check (there was only 4 of us and we only ordered one item each except I had ordered edamame for the table.) I definitely wont be coming back. I get misunderstandings happen especially during a busy lunch hour, but when you're blatantly rude to me in front of people I work with I have to draw the line there."}
{"text":"Excellent food and good service, especially during the craziness of Super Bowl week! Everything we ate was awesome, and the purple rice was delicious!  And, the \"Oh My God Roll\" was just that- OMG! It was brought to the table and set on fire-AWESOME! So good we ordered another one! 

I will definitely be back here next time I am in Phoenix..."}
{"text":"Great sushi place. Owner is very friendly with lots of suggestions. They use a mixture of black and white rice on their rolls and it comes out purple. One of the tastiest spicy tuna and eel rolls I've ever had. This is a must eat place. Say hi to Juno. He fantastic"}
{"text":"I love Harumi Sushi! This has become my favorite sushi place in town. We used to frequent Hana's on 7th Avenue, which is very good, but this place is even better in my opinion. The sushi is always great. They have a series of pretty inexpensive rolls (two spicy rolls and the typical california and cucumber rolls, etc.) and then a bunch of specialty rolls. I'd love them to expand their menu further, so that we have more things to try. 

This place feels very authentic and friendly to me. The building is casual (which may be a downside for some, but I prefer it). Nothing fancy, just an excellent meal in a comfortable environment. 

Nothing better than some sushi, a friendly neighborhood place, and a large Sapporo on a weeknight! 

I also really like it when the chef says good night when you leave!"}
{"text":"Food was off the chain. However, the staff and owner make no bones about letting you know that you represent dollars to them. As soon as our last entree was on the table, they were trying to rush us out. After dinner, my friend and I shared another drink and caught up. The owner, bus boy and both servers made us feel like we were infringing on their ability to turn the table. We are talking every minute, on the minute. It felt extremely awkward and uncomfortable. The food was good, but these people lack tact. We were \"camping out\" no more than 20 minutes. We would have ordered another round along with dessert but I simply couldn't bare it any longer. To top it off, the 2 adjacent tables sat vacant for 10 minutes after their patrons had left. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I love finding restaurants that are great quality and great prices! I was in town for one night and didn't want hotel food or pizza. So I gave this place a chance and I was not disappointed. Sat down and got complimentary miso soup and edamame. My friend and I ordered a shrimp tempura roll which was yummy and well made. The best deal of the night was the spicy sashimi salad! For only $9 bucks, what a steal! It had plenty of tuna and salmon and the sauce that was mixed in was a perfect blend flavors with the right about of spice. The owner/chef did come around and tell us that if it was too spicy, to let him know next time. I also ordered the ramen with shrimp tempura which was ok. Don't expect it to be like an ippudo or legit Japanese ramen. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place! They're pretty slow since they just barely opened but I hope this business finds much success."}
{"text":"Sashimi is kinda flavorless, but their cooked rolls are good, especially with the purple rice! I also liked the oasis roll as a low carb option - it's like crab salad, chunks of tuna, avocado wrapped in cucumber and topped with a soy glaze and spicy mayo. 

Check in and you'll also get free edamame and miso soup!"}
{"text":"Sorrrryyyy to be a hater but I seriously do not get the hype.  Is it just the purple rice????

I've been here twice and have been underwhelmed each time.  This last time I got the Oasis Roll and it was such a mistake!  The cucumber was just falling off the roll.  Plus, it had SO MUCH imitation crab in it that I couldn't taste any of the fish.  I'm guessing this place is pretty popular because there isn't a lot of choices for sushi downtown.  If you have a spot you like in your neighborhood, this probably isn't a trek you want to make."}
{"text":"Having been born and raised in Los Angeles, I've had some pretty dern good sushi. Big coastal cities will do that to ya - give you the upper hand when it comes to great seafood. So when I moved to PHX, I pretty much settled on not experiencing mind blowing sushi the way I had back home. And then I found Harumi. I venture this place at least once a month. It's a favorite for all special occasions and sushi cravings (They usually come in cycles and correspond with the full moon). The fish is always super fresh and the flavor combinations of their signature rolls will definitely familiarize your palate with umami. Hands down best sushi in PHX."}
{"text":"My friends and I were downtown for a show and decided to give Harumi a try.   It's definitely very casual so don't take a date if you are trying to impress them with the décor.  
 
The service if efficient, the food is good, the prices are reasonable.    I loved the roll with the sweet potato. 

Interesting note:  Go find the restroom.   It's an interesting location."}
{"text":"My wife and I were surprised when we ordered the OH MY GOD sushi roll. The waiter had it wrapped in foil and had blue flames lit on the plate for unwrapping! Great presentation and absolutely delicious flavor combination."}
{"text":"It's rare that I can convince my husband to eat sushi in Arizona, but on a recent double date, he gave in and joined me and our friends Andrew and Jules for a quick bite at Harumi Sushi before we headed to a show downtown.

I called ahead to make sure we could get seated and was told they don't take reservations or call-ahead, but we took our chances and luckily were seated within a few minutes of arriving.  (It was around 6:30pm on a Saturday night and we just beat the crowd!)

Jade was our server and was awesome... We ordered edamame, veggie tempura, and a bunch of sashimi and sushi to share family style.  I had a seaweed salad and I believe a few miso soups were ordered as well.  The boys enjoyed some saki while Jules and I went with iced green tea, which as really refreshing.

We were impressed with the quality of the sashimi (yellowtail and salmon) and the forbidden / purple rice they use in the rolls is tasty and unique with plenty of health benefits per the signage around the restaurant.  Prices are reasonable and service is quick and friendly.

It's exciting to see how much the downtown restaurant scene has exploded over the years.  There are plenty of options to choose from, and Harumi is definitely a solid choice -- especially if you're craving sushi.  Looking forward to return visits (and likely my husband will join me now too.)  Either way, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Chirashi which is an assortment of fish and vegetable served over a bed of their black rice. Although they can split the check, it's very difficult to do so with a large party."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best sushi restaurants in the valley. The service is excellent. The spicy sashimi salad is not to be missed. Such reasonable prices for such high-quality!"}
{"text":"Stopped here craving good sushi and I wasn't disappointed. Very quick and great service, they explained any questions I had concerning the menu and even suggested a nice Japanese beer. Overall sweet experience definitely would  recommend shouts out to this sushi spot for filling my belly real good, I'd suggest the Las Vegas rolls XD"}
{"text":"I found my new sushi spot in central PHX. Great service and location near the light rail. Had the gyoza for an appetizer which was good. Ordered the albacore nigiri and a crab mania roll which were both delicious and all the rice is purple!!! Don't let it freak you out as texture and flavor are great."}
{"text":"Got booted out of my booth because \"employees are going to eat here\"...moved to a fabulous booth in the hot sun. Asked what beers they had in bottle and was pointed to a beer fridge. Didn't know this was a self serve establishment. Ended up not eating and leaving - never to return."}
{"text":"Founds this on Yelp- so many great reviews for a place I'd never even heard of. The space isn't much to look at, but the staff is friendly and efficient, the sushi is decent, and the prices reasonable. Beer and wine only.

- Greeted with two pieces of complimentary seared tuna salmon sushi while we read through the menu. I don't usually go for cooked sushi, but it was a nice gesture and actually quite good.

The rolls are large with fresh fish and pretty purple rice. If not the best I've ever had, it could be because we chose poorly.
- Harumi roll- love the crunch of tempura shrimp, stuffed with a lot of krab salad which was just ok.
- H3 roll- this was my fave- spicy tuna and salmon, avocado, cuke, topped w/ eel sauce and spicy mayo
- OMG roll- the server brings this foil wrapped package to the table and waves it over a flame a few minutes before opening. I like eel sauce, but this one was just too sweet for my taste.
- Sashimi salad- good amount of tuna and salmon tossed with cucumber, avocado, and a bit of lettuce. Next time I would ask them to go light on the eel sauce.
- Real wasabi- this was new to me, bright green and a bit slimy looking, it tasted pretty good.

Overall, not a destination, but not a bad option if you're in the area and looking for affordable sushi."}
{"text":"Amazing! I'm a bonafide sushi lover now although I haven't mastered the chopsticks and I played it safe with California rolls."}
{"text":"Hands down, easily the best sushi in Phoenix and surrounding areas. H3 roll and Ahi Tower are to die for along with their dry sake.  

I had previously left a poor review about their service but I am here to correct that judgement. We just ate here again with our 7 month in tow and staff was wonderful."}
{"text":"I have been looking for great Sushi Bars in Central Phoenix/ Downtown area at a reasonable price point... I have tried squid ink and Nobuo at Teeter house and this place by far beats them both fro taste, satisfaction, service, and cost efficiency! Don't get me wrong I enjoyed my experiences at the other places, but Harumi has made my day! Do yourself a big favor and try it for yourself at least once. I had ordered over the phone, two OMG ( Oh My God)  rolls to go for lunch for myself and a coworker. I was told 15 minutes, I was there in 10 and they were ready for me when I arrived. Now do keep in mind this is my very first visit to Harumi , and I was blown away at the freshness of the shrimp, crab, and eel, the purple rice definitely added to the taste profile of this roll. It was amazing and delicious, I nearly devoured and inhaled it...LOL! So for my experience at Harumi today I give them a 5 star rating. Keep up the great job HARUMI and Employees!"}
{"text":"I came back from Tokyo, Japan in December. I was therefore very, very skeptical about finding good seafood or fish in Phoenix at all, much less decent sushi.

This was not decent sushi.

This was OMFG awesome sushi. I ordered \"omakase\" as I had learned to in Japan, which is basically saying, \"Chef's choice\". He came out later to apologize for making so much - for the $25 I had two rolls plus about 10 pieces of sashimi too. It was all AMAZINGLY fresh. Turns out, he's from Osaka, and was very impressed and honored by my knowledge of Japanese customs. Apparently few order \"omakase\", which is the standard way to do it in Japan.

Great service. Quiet. Good spot in downtown Phoenix. If you like sushi, and you are in Phoenix, you must go here. Amazeballs."}
{"text":"When hubby and I visit a sushi place for the first time, we make it a point to order the Omakase (leaving your gastronomic fate in the sushi Chef's expert choices ;-) ). And that's exactly what we set out to do. We called it our Appetizer platter. The server named each of the sashimi and sushi nigiri that the Chef prepared for us. But as soon as she left, we wasted no time and dig in into our little pockets of joy using our chopsticks. We asked for fresh wasabi, too. The fresh and herb-y and citrusy and slightly bitter flavor of fresh wasabi is worlds apart from prepared wasabi, for sure! Well worth the try, really.
Place does get super packed. When we called, we were told they were not busy (yet), and that was at 7:30 on a Friday evening. When we arrived at 8:00, they got very full and very busy! But no worries, the staff greeted us, and immediately made us feel \"right at home\". The place is relatively small and narrow, but our table towards the back of the restaurant was comfortable and not as tightly packed and claustrophobic as the ones upfront. 
Finding parking might be a bit tough (since they are close to the Orpheum), so plan to spend some time to hunt down a parking space nearby.
On to the purple rice. There's an overhead TV by the cash register which explains why it's better than white or brown rice for you--its rich in antioxidants and minerals, and has been dubbed an anti-cancer superfood. Well, I still will remain fond of the traditional vinegar'd white rice (I prefer its sticky texture over the drier and nuttier flavor of the purple rice. But don't take my word for it. Gotta try it and then you form your own opinion about it). 
So, once again, the Omakase plate is worth every cent of the $35.00 price tag. Hubby and I ordered not one but TWO Omakase plates. It's that great!
This is our sushi place whenever we are in Phoenix from now on. Until we find the next wonderful sushi place"}
{"text":"Wanted my fist real sushi experience to be good sushi. So here it is, they are wonderful! I had the oasis roll which was not bad and my friend had the Las Vegas roll which was breaded and just so good! Although I wasn't a complete fan of my option, the cook was kind enough to offer us a free Harumi sushi roll per he made an extra. It was very good. He also advised that if I didn't like the cucumber; which I think was soaked in a type of vinegar-that I have the option of asking for a soy wrapping. I will definitely return to this place again. They were so nice and helpful. Service was just great."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever! My new go to spot for sushi. I love their Vegas roll and OMG roll. Wait staff is nice the purple rice they use for the sushi is something different. It's a small space so it gets crowded easily but worth the wait if they are busy."}
{"text":"The freshest most delicious sushi in my downtown bubble. Great for lunch and even better for dinner and the times I've been in it was super bustling. It's probably the hottest spot on the block. 
The albacore tuna sashimi melted on my tongue and the tuna titaki  was probable the sexiest thing I've had in my mouth in quite some time. 
One thing's for sure and that is a great meal, great quality, happy staff, uber friendly owner and an empty pile of plates.

My faves:
Stuffed Jalapenos, Oh My God Roll, Sex and the City Roll, H3 Roll and of course the tuna titaki. 

Oh and FYI, the Chef's Choice sampler is just that... Chef's Choice... Leave it to me to try and change things up."}
{"text":"Love love love this sushi place! The purple rice is a refreshing change and had more flavor! The rolls are delightful and surprisingly large compared to other places. The grab and go is convenient however the supply is limited so get there fast! Overall this place is a home run for me!"}
{"text":"All of the yes. Everything I put in my mouth from them was magical. The miso soup was hot and flavorful. The shrimp tempura was crisp and the sauce they sent with it was complex and multifaceted. The chirashi was some of the freshest I've eaten and the forbidden rice was delicious as well. I've always thought I hated wasabi, but it turns out I only hate powdered wasabi - the fresh stuff is delicious in moderation."}
{"text":"The purple rice here is certainly amazing, but from all the hype I was expecting WAY delicious rolls. Instead, I got deinitely good rolls, but nothing super outstanding. The best roll by far was their Oh My God roll. It has eel and it comes out in flames! Impressive visually and tasty. We got three other rolls which I don't even remember the names of. They weren't that imoressive.

What I enjoyed:
-OMG roll
-Stuffed jalapenos
-Salmon sashimi (hard to mess this up, nice fatty chunks)
-Purple sushi rice (you don't have to ask for this, it comes with all rolls and, in my opinion, adds a whole other dimension to the roll because of its flavor)"}
{"text":"Family in town and sushi on their mind. Speed or quality? They said quality...And wow, we got quality with the focus of the entire team. Greated with a welcome smile, complimentary appetizer which teased our palates with fresh and spicy tuna and our order in...We devoured the mango roll, one of our faves, jalapeno appetizer which was beautiful combination of spicy and creamy with a hint of sweet eel sauce...followed by rich miso soup that was fully deep of flavor. OK, maybe not in that order, I can't recall ...It was all an experiential blur of fresh, delightful food. As we proceeded through nigiri cephalopod selection (Ika and Tako), sweet ebi and comforting unagi....We couldn't resist asking the chef to honor us with their choice and arrived shortly was a masterpiece of roe-balls that had earthy rice and popping pearls and whatever wizardry the sashimi wraps were provided. Did I say we wanted quality? I'm fairly certain the family in town have a new request in future and I'm left thinking I don't come here often enough.

Well done all involved this evening. Amazing!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best spot in Phoenix to get sushi. The rice is purple and seasoned well. Out if the 3 times I have been here the food has been consistently great. Fish always fresh, staff always friendly. The amount of food you get is awesome as well, I ordered 5 rolls thinking it was gonna be small, except it was not....at all. I did end up eating all 5 rolls cause I had the \"munchies\".  
Anyway to sum it up, best sushi spot in Phoenix,  fresh food, friendly staff, they only thing I would worry about is parking"}
{"text":"The sushi wasn't too bad for a lunch spot! 

Everyone was kind when waiting on us, and the sushi came out quick. However, the quality of the fish was not excellent. The presentation was great, but there wasn't much flavor to the rolls. I will agree it is much better than ra or stingray sushi, but it couldn't compare to Roka Akor or Sushi Roku. 

Slightly disappointed because this spot had 4 1/2 stars out of 350 reviews."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi for being in the desert. Staff were friendly and outgoing! Will def come back."}
{"text":"My new spot for sushi. Worth the wait for sure on there busy days! Wow, the variety and the fresh taste! While waiting in line we spoke to a few people and one guy said he comes all the way from chandler to this place for sushi. I only understood why after we ate. Good service too! Very caring and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and I admit a
bit dubious about eating sushi in Arizona.  However, I found the food was excellent and service was friendly and very attentive.  

I had veggie tempura, H3 roll and the OMG roll; all three were excellent.  The OMG roll comes wrapped in tin foil and is flamed by the server for a smoky flavor -- a first for me -- but both rolls were large, rich, complex and very hearty.  

The only reason why this isn't a 5 star rating was the atmosphere, feeling a bit more like a lunch hour deli than Japanese restaurant.  The stereo pumping out loud 80s favorites like \"Karma Chameleon\", \"Ghost Busters\" and \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was a bit odd -- no, more surreal than just odd.  I sat at the front and perhaps the ambience was different at the sushi bar or at the back.  

I'd come back for the food and service but perhaps not the musical playlist."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. This is the best sushi I've ever had in Phoenix. I honestly don't know what's better, the sushi or the prices!! The lunch deals are unreal and the normal dinner menu is also great. The fish is fresh and delicious! Stop what you're doing, get in your car, and go to Harumi right now!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on Friday night around 630pm. It was busy and there was a line. They said 20 min wait. It was totally worth it. The employees were all wonderful the food was fantastic. They are very attentive with drinks and anything else you may need. We had delicious food, we tried the  oh my god roll that was good but probably my least favorite. The presentation is fun they light a fire on a plate and bring it to the table and let it simmer out. The spicy scallop roll was yummy and my fav was the dynamite roll. Spicy but not too hot. Just perfect but they were all good. I would eat there every single day if possible."}
{"text":"Everything we had was made with black rice, which comes out looking purple. Very unique when presenting the dishes. Ramen, dynamite roll, spicy tuna roll, and more. Everything we had was simply amazing. I travel every week all over the U.S. And sushi is always on my list for food choices....I have never given a five star review for sushi before and have been to 30 or more sushi places this year in many different cities....I wish I lived in Phoenix, I'd be here every week."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff, this is how a restaurant should operate. We had an issue with part of our meal and they went above and beyond for us.

Their \"black\" rice is amazing as well!! Well worth the trip downtown to enjoy."}
{"text":"Harumi will be by new go to sushi place. The owner himself served me and my boyfriend (we came during non peak times). He patiently answered all our questions and was extremely nice. I love that they use healthier black rice and that their fish tasted really clean. My boyfriend and I ate all the food and were super happy to get to enjoy some freebies like Mochi ice cream and even a 4 piece nigiri."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very welcoming. We had a fantastic experience. The chef and owner, Juno is a warm person who caters your menu to what you would enjoy. 

Juno is amazing. We had the Sashimi / Sushi sampler. The freshest fish in Arizona. What a hidden gem!! 

We look forward to returning and sampling more of Chef Juno's special creations."}
{"text":"IN LOVE! Went here on a Wednesday night and had super fast service. The food was amazing, we had to get extra just for two people so we could try more. Highly recommend for a nice casual evening for sushi."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner for the first time since it came highly recommended. I have to say I'm not a big sushi person but this place has completely converted me!  The tuna melts in your mouth like butter, the shrimp tempura was cooked perfectly and the green tea ice cream was so refreshing; I also love their purple rice that the sushi was served in. 

The staff was super nice and the chef was incredibly friendly and welcoming!  This 100% just became our weekly Tuesday dinner spot!  I'm kind of craving it now as I'm typing this. You must check this place out, you will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Again with coworkers and found it on Yelp. This place is mainly sushi with a few dishes like ramen that can be ordered. The most interesting thing about this place is that they use black rice to make the sushi. What I really liked about the rolls was that they do not use a lot of rice so you experience more of the ingredients. Also that they were bite size and not how am I going to put this huge sushi roll in my mouth size."}
{"text":"Delicious, savory, fresh fish melts in your mouth. It's so good that I dream about the seared tuna and spider rolls. The best sushi in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special with shrimp tempura roll, Las Vegas roll, miso soup and gyoza. My husband ordered the sex in the city roll. Overall great atmosphere and great food. Nice music. We sat right by the sushi bar so I enjoyed watching the chefs make the rolls. If you're over this way, definitely come and check them out."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite sushi place. My fiancé wanted to leave at first because there was a bit of a line for a table and we had tickets to see John Mayer. I convinced him the expected wait time was a generous approximation. I was right and we are so glad that we waited (20 minutes) to try Harumi. I love the purple rice, the atmosphere, and the hysterical waiters and waitresses. Seriously, service here is amazing. I had such a fun time. Everyone is so friendly and funny. They chat it up and tell you how to cheers in Japanese. It was fantastic! The sushi chef even gave me a free sample of their seared salmon nigiri (forgot to take a picture). All the sushi came out really quickly and tasted amazing. The prices were very reasonable for all their rolls and alcohol. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! The chef Armando is amazing! We loved everything we tried, his suggestions were perfect! 

We will definitely be back! 

Really nice staff and clean nice place."}
{"text":"Might be one of my favorite sushi spots ever.  Fish was fresh, the black / purple sushi rice was very tasty and service was fast and very helpful.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"We didn't love Harumi, unfortunately. The purple rice was so weird to me. Why not just regular rice? Perhaps it was my mind playing tricks on me, but the purple rice tasted sweeter than a traditional sushi rice so that threw off the flavor. The service was friendly, and it was nice that the restaurant was open late on a Monday night, but the interior itself needs some work. To use the restroom, you have to walk through their screened off \"storage\" area at the back of the restaurant, past the guys trying to bleach the ice machine, outside, and down the breezeway connected with the kitchens of other restaurants to a bizarre one-stall bathroom. There are better sushi places in Phoenix... sorry!"}
{"text":"great quality sushi especially for a place in Arizona. Ordered the blue fin combo, tobiko, OMG roll, and the ahi tower. The ahi tower was great, the flavor balanced out nicely with a bit of sweetness in the sauce. The blue fin was thick and buttery in texture, it went real well with wasabi and soy sauce. The OMG roll was so so only and the tobiko wasn't the best I've had. overall great place for sushi, I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a weekday, restaurant was not busy, there were a few tables open along with a few booths. I had been eyeballing this place for some time now, and finally managed to go in. When you first walk in you are suppose to be greeted yet we walked in and the cashier stared at us for a while before asking how many of us there were. There was two of us we didn't get a choice in where we wanted to seat he just kind of pointed us to a table right by the entrance. His customer service skills lacked, after having sat there for another 8 min before we were noticed they came to ask for our drinks. they only provided us with 1 menu they have paper menus in which you mark what exactly you want. This took quite a bit of time since it was our first time here and we had to wait for each one of us to explore the menu. After finally waiting about 15 min for someone to come check on us we placed our order. The chef brought out a complimentary side dish to eat while we waited for our food. Presentation was nice, the fish was delightful. However when sushi rolls arrived all 3 of my sushi rolls were not fully rolled and came apart every time."}
{"text":"I've been to Harumi Sushi about 3 times between 6-8 months and every visit has made my belly smile. Their food is always consistent with great flavor and that explains Harumi's high rating.

First and foremost, let's not debate prices. You're going to eat high quality sushi and your wallet is going to get thin at the end of your meal. The price is pretty average for a downtown high quality sushi restaurant. 

The service is very good! They did forget an item on my list though, once, but that's forgivable. Also, with high such popularity and high demand in a tiny restaurant, the wait times are long.

I'm more of a traditional sushi eater, so I typically order seaweed salad, gyoza, tempura,  sashimi, maki, and nigiri.
What's not traditional about this place is the forbidden rice that they use. I thought it was very interesting!

The seaweed salad is just right. It tastes what it should be like. They also add some daikon shreds at the bottom too which is unusual in my experience, but it's not bad. The gyoza was a bit dry and overcooked (i have yet to find the perfect gyoza). Tempura was crispy and the veggies tasted fine. 

I've always had salmon and yellow tail sashimi and they always taste the same: awesome. The fish is silky full of omega 3's. The texture is buttery smooth (especially the salmon) and the yellowtail is always sweet and flavorful. I enjoy eating them with the shredded daikon bed underneath each piece. 

As for rolls and nigiris, the avocado roll came with cucumber (which I did not expect) and it was a pleasant surprise. I thought I wouldn't like it but I actually enjoyed it since it's not my usual plain avocado maki. The spicy salmon roll was wasn't bad at all (it's missing the \"oomf\" factor) but I did find the pieces to be a bit small. Maybe the small rolls and thinner ingredients contributed to the lack of flavor. The eel nigiri bursts inside your mouth. Each bite has the perfect amount of glaze/sauce, flavor, and texture (very soft!). Salmon nigiri's are amazing. 

I will definitely go back to try out new foods and expand my comfort zone. Next thing on the list will definitely be a specialty roll."}
{"text":"The only place in Phoenix that I will revisit for sushi. It is ridiculously tasty and prices are beyond reasonable. I thought finding a legit sushi joint in Phoenix would be tough, and it sorta still is! Every time someone outta town visits, I make sure to take them here because it's that good.  The sushi chefs and servers are all so friendly and chat you up too. Omakase is only $35! I get this every time and it never disappoints. I've tried various rolls and they've all been yummy too.

I knew I loved it here when I ordered sushi to-go. I ate half of it, then refrigerated the rest to snack on at a later time. The purple rice was still soft! It wasn't all dry/hardened at all! I was like whaaaaat never have I experienced that. Can't wait to eat here again"}
{"text":"We just moved here frm Chicago so we have high standards of Sushi & food in general.  We chose this place because of the rave reviews...THANK YOU  fellow Yelpers!!!  This place was awesome!  Small place but cute, good ambiance & good service.  The Sushi was phenomen!  We had to try the H3 & OMG rolls due to all the great reviews & videos, they lived up.  After that...we just kept ordering Nigiri & Sashimi until we needed a wheel barrel!  Also, very reasonable prices.  We had a blast, will def go back!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this was the BEST sushi I have EVER had. Great prices super authentic and the purple rice makes it so fun! I wish I could give 10 stars. And it's super affordable ! Nothing else comes close"}
{"text":"Quaint, local and great service! We all get cravings and sushi is one of them!! Centrally located in Downtown Phoenix is a spot that will fulfill that craving! From entering on a Friday night it was busy inside. Not a huge place which I prefer it being the size it is. We were greeted immediately and sat right away. No wait for anything from our drinks to getting our starters. 

Of course I have to get the typical edameme and also ordered the crab salad. Edameme was warm, and the crab salad was in roll form! Delicious! Real crab not the fake krab btw...Anyways my dinner date ordered a platter of sashimi including albacore tuna,salmon and yellowtail. I ordered a combo plate with 3 different rolls for only $15.00!! They all were fresh and tasty! They do use purple rice, do not be afraid it is perfectly fine! They also do not skimp on the portions of filling and the rice is not overwheming like most places. 
I don't appreciate when I get a roll and most of it is rice and small amount of filling.

The overall experience was fulfilling and I felt very satisfied! Please go and visit and support our wonderful downtown! I will most definitely be returning to satisfy future cravings!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch alone. SOOO busy. Sat at the bar type seating by the entrance. My food came out quick and was amazing quality. I ordered tuna tataki (yum. $12), but had to wipe off the horseradish on top because I'm weak. I also ordered the rainbow roll lunch special ($13) it also came with another roll, 2 nigiri, and miso! Such a great deal. Enjoyed it very much. I was satisfied after the tataki and struggled to finish the plentiful lunch special. The only qualm I have is that I wish I knew the wifi password."}
{"text":"The sushi is good, not super flavorful but the fish is excellent and it's prepared well. By far some of the best eel I've had, but there's not much in the way of more traditional rolls, so it's a lot of sauce and deep frying. We were unable to be seated until our whole group was present, which was frustrating since it was slow and there's no waiting area, but the catering place next door was making cake pops so I was entertained. 
By far the best part was the Oh My God roll. It's wrapped in tinfoil and lit on fire giving it a Smokey and wholly unique flavor which was honestly incredible. However, we didn't know it was going to be lit on fire so when they did the whole table kind of freaked out a little and when my friend asked the waitress what was going on she just said \"oh my god\" which of course we responded \"yeah, that's what we said. Oh my god, why is it on fire!?!?\" It took us a while to realize she meant Oh My God Roll! We got a good laugh out of that. It's a small place and worth going for the omg roll. But be prepared, they light it on fire!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! A group of us go every Friday for co-worker/group lunch. The staff there will recognize us and seat us as quickly as possible (on a Friday at noon, it understandably takes time sometimes). Service has always been impeccable, drinks are refilled and we're checked on multiple times during the meal.

Food is fantastic! High quality sashimi and the range of available rolls is great! Everything costs what you would expect and nothing is overpriced.

Always look forward to Friday lunch here as it is a treat to end the week on!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is amazing!  I have never found a good sushi restaurant in Phoenix up until now.  We decided to order a few different specialty rolls and each one was fresh, tasty, and yummy especially the oh my god roll.  What's in it, you ask?  Order it and find out. you will definitely say \"oh my god\".  Find out why they named it that.  

Now, one major weakness.  I saw that they have beef bulgogi on their menu.  I got excited that they had this.  Usually, bulgogi is a korean dish, but I was hungry and decided to order it as well.  Word of advice:  Don't.  It was really really chewy and rubbery for me.  

Stick to the sushi and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Be careful, this place accommodates parties of four people max comfortably since it's a small place. They have more tables for couples. The waiter we got was so unenthused when my family of six walked in. He also gave lousy service. The sushi itself was average, 3 star. But I give this place 1 star because I got the worst food poisoning of my life. Granted it's raw fish, so I take a cayenne pill to help kill any bacteria which should be suitable enough(if sushi is fresh/ prepared correctly). Unfortunately I had stomach aches, threw up, and had diarrhea. All together bad experience, would not come back."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. This place is an absolute must. The staff is incredible and helpful. The food is unbelievable. It is one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing.

Undoubtedly best sushi in AZ.

Had sushi all over the west coast and I'd say this is among some of the best I've had"}
{"text":"Had time to kill after a conference downtown and filtered my Yelp search for walking distance and most stars. Up came Harumi sushi and it indeed delivered. Unlike many sushi places it wasn't closed between lunch and dinner so that was nice. 

The atmosphere let's just say is functional given a fairly long and narrow space, but makes for a nice long sushi bar and some booths to the side. There's a seating across the front for people watching while you eat which is what I did. The bathroom situation is a bit funky having to go out the back and through some corridors and what not, but they were clean. 

Now onto the important part, the fare:

 I had the chef's choice sashimi plate for $12, which was awesome, fresh, and fairly filling with decent size cuts. 

I also ordered a Philadelphia roll add jalapeño for $6+$1 and it again was tasty. Now it had some purple rice and I forgot to ask what that was about. I'm sure it's healthier than white rice for whatever reason, but more importantly it was yummy. 

Would definitely go back if I'm in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI IN ARIZONA!!!!


I come here often because they have the best sushi ever. I like to order the crunch roll, crab mania, sexy crab salad, omg sushi , arizona and the shrimp crunch one!! It never disappoints:)"}
{"text":"Loved the purple rice.  The rolls are beautifully arranged and at a good price.  Sushi in this area are usually overpriced and small.  My friend and I ordered two rolls each, miso, and edamame (miso and edamame free with yelp check in!).  Way too much food for the two of us.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last night and loved it. Had squid nigiri, salmon nigiri, and yellowtail nigiri.  The black rice, fresh wasabi, and wasabi leaves were perfect. And during dinner, I opened up yelp on my phone to see what other people had to say and I believe one of the waitresses saw it, ran back to the kitchen, and had the waiter send out another order of Yellowtail nigiri free of charge. They are too kind. Had the green tea mochi ice cream for dessert and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'll be making special trips downtown just for this sushi."}
{"text":"generally it is very tasty! 

We ordered the seaweed salad, vegetable tempura, miso soup, harumi sushi roll, chefs combo including 6 nigiri, sashimi, and oasis roll. We quite like harumi roll which is quite flavorful and a bit of spicy. The vegetable tempura is also very good with the sauce.  

The only thing I don't like that much is the oasis roll. It is rolled by cucumber which is easily get loose and difficult to pick up."}
{"text":"AC may be broke it is a little warm in here.  My table rocks from side to side and they don't have draft beer.  But the food is on point.  A good spread in the omakase and it included several pieces of toro and other items that would have made it a lot more expensive than the $35 it cost.  What a deal.  The fish was fresh and there wasn't anything I didn't eat.  I also ordered the seaweed salad and shrimp tempura which were just okay - nothing particularly amazing or terrible about them, though I have to say the shrimp in the tempura was pretty scrawny and it just tasted like hot oil.  Service here is fast but they aren't very warm or friendly."}
{"text":"Showed up at Harumi without a reservation and had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table for two. It was a busy place and as it turns out, well worth the short wait. I enjoyed their rendition of a dynamite roll with tuna on top. The H3 roll was recommend in another review so we gave that a try too, spicy but very good. Portions are generous and there was ample Wasabi/ginger with each item. I like that their rolls are sliced thinner than most places around Phoenix, more reasonable bites this way."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy it makes me want to pull my phone out mid meal to type about it. (Which I did not do bc bad etiquette!)

Harumi has got my favorite sushi in all of AZ! Started with the omakase, which is so reasonable for $35 (and that's coming from someone who eats sushi every time I go back to San Diego). All the selections were super fresh! I think it was some tuna that was SO mouthwatering and just melted in my mouth. OOH I also think it's so cool they use purple rice here! Got a taste of that in the H3 roll & the OMG roll. H3 was good, but the OMG roll was...OMG. If you love novelty rolls and exciting food - TRY THIS OMG ROLL! It's set on fire in front of you and you will likely be exclaiming \"OMG!\"

I really love Harumi and want to try to come back as frequently as I can!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept. This place is quick-service, order at the counter, sushi restaurant. You go in, place your order, pay for it, and then they bring it over. You fill your own drinks at the machine.

The sushi was fine. It was nothing special but the prices are great and the service was very fast. If I lived or worked around there, I could definitely see myself going frequently."}
{"text":"I was here during Grace Hopper, and this place was packed. It was apparently the busiest day they had ever had. 

The server was a little brief but I understood he was under a great deal of stress. The TV was showing some weird show about making fake food I think? I was confused. I grew up watching Japanese soaps with my father but this was something else. I found it entertaining but I'm not sure that everyone wants to watch that. 

The food came out quickly and was fresh and delicious. For this quality sushi it wasn't a bad price either. I would come here again if I am ever in the area. 

They were totally understanding of splitting the bill with two cards in unequal amounts, and I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Always fresh sushi, quick lunch service and smiling staff. I go there often. The only place for sushi in downtown Phoenix  in my mind."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable prices... Ordered the Omakase and fresh Wasabi with some hot sake.... It was really good."}
{"text":"So when I first walked in I had my doubts (the place does look like a mall food court) but the sushi was amazing. Very fresh sashimi and the specialty rolls were really really good (try the Oasis roll). The waiter and sushi chef were super friendly also."}
{"text":"Absolutely the very best sushi I have ever had! Better than sushi in Hawaii, and worth the 30mile drive to eat here!  The ahi tuna tower and HG roll are the bomb!!! The rolls are full of tons of fish and the black rice is super delicious and hard to find!  This is a must try!"}
{"text":"The purple rice took some getting used to. The fish was fresh and the rolls were large. Service was good. I would have liked a more diverse menu since most of the rolls had eel sauce on them which I don't like."}
{"text":"My favorite dish crunchy shrimp on the appetizer menu. The sushi chefs are fun and all the food is amazing. I'm from Colorado and every time I'm in town I try to make it one of my stops. Went with my son tonight who is going to college here , he's hooked now! Reasonable prices too!"}
{"text":"Loved it.  All the sushi is made with Forbidden Rice, which is delicious.  Everything came out very quickly and everything was great, especially the Tuna Tataki, seared salmon, Spider Roll, and real wasabi.  This is a no-frills, great value, delicious place to grab sushi in downtown Phoenix.  Next time, we want to try the OMG Roll, which is served flaming at your table."}
{"text":"Not a sushi fan, but this place is good.  Fresh wasabi which is pretty rare.  Nice gimmick with the purple rice to let them stand out.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"I love this place! I love sushi and theirs is fresh and delicious.
They have some premade rolls you can take to go (or eat there if you like) or you can order from their menu and they'll make it fresh. I believe their price's fair for the quality of their food and they use purple rice which is healthier than white rice.

The seating area isn't too big but they have a few tables. If you're part of a big group, though, it'll be hard for you to find seating, specially at lunch time. 

Service is pretty fast, even at lunch time when they're the busiest and the staff's always nice and courteous.

All in all, it's a very good place to get sushi downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurants! Laid back atmosphere and delicious sushi...black rice...order the volcano--wow! Good sake selection!"}
{"text":"I came here several times, as it was very convenient to my old job. Service and staff are friendly and attentive. The sushi was just okay, which would just make me crave sushi even more. Just okay sushi is not worth their lunch prices."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my friend the other day. The sushi is really good, love that they use the \"black rice\". The only con I would say is that parking is an issue if your coming during lunch, considering it is downtown. My friend had to park in the $12 parkings, which is pricey."}
{"text":"Tried it for lunch and wow!! They use this amazingly black rice, everything we tried was fresh and wonderful!! H3, mango roll and mini roll sampler (not mini btw) Good size portions and super friendly staff. I think we're going back for dinner"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and it was AMAZING! We had the bluefin special and tuna stack. You just can't go wrong with the Tuna Stack. This is my go to place for sushi every time."}
{"text":"My go to Sushi joint, in between visiting clients in downtown Phoenix. They have the freshest fish, generous portions and creatively delicious rolls. They also use \"forbidden rice\" which is also known as black rice, which adds a unique spin to most of the other sushi places in the greater Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I highly recommend checking this place out. I especially liked the fact that they didn't try and rush us out. We were there for a while, chatting, after we were done eating."}
{"text":"Been here once. I'll be back again! Finally tried after been bookmarked for a couple years.. Quick and attentive service. Got the roll they set on fire ''twas really good & decorative! Did not disappoint. PURPLE RIIICE"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Came here on a friend's recommendation and was very happy with the find. Fish was fresh, price was good."}
{"text":"After seeing all the pictures and reviews, we decided to give this place a try. Since this place is in downtown Phoenix, it was difficult to find parking on a Saturday night. The restaurant is a little hidden, but we were able to find it.

The place was pretty busy when we went in, but we were instantly greeted. We started off with the Oh my god roll because it simply sounded good, and OH MY GOD, IT WAS AWESOME!

It came super quick, wrapped in aluminum foil that was on fire. It looked super good, and tasted amazing. It had a kick to it, and mmmm I could eat another one right now.

After that, we ordered the H3 Roll. It was a lot spicier, still good, but definitely not as good as the first one. 

Maybe we were just hungry, or we were surprised by the fact that the sushi came on fire. But man, I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall place. Great service. Good price. Nigiri was good, not fishy, had a generous cut of fish on top. The purple rice used gives the sushi a colourful different look. Lost a star only because I haven't tried a roll that was really different and unique. I had the scallop, dynamite, rainbow, H3 rolls and the tuna and salmon nigiri."}
{"text":"I can't rate this establishment. But wanted to note how difficult it is to get in. From the outside it looks like a hole in the wall. On the inside it's a small dive like location. The food looked amazing and smelled fresh. I tried getting in twice and it was just too hard. The first time I came in at 6 and they already had a 30-45 minutes wait. The next time I came at 4 and apparently they didn't open for another hour. My stars were not aligned with this place."}
{"text":"I might be the biggest fan of hole in the wall places with great food in Phoenix, but the service here was so lacking I doubt I'd ever be back. The host threw a huge fit when we requested a small booth for two rather than a table, then I spilled my water allll over the place on accident & the waitress left me soaked for a little then tossed three napkins my way. The sushi itself was worth 4 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Great place. A different slant on traditional sushi. They use sauces and for the rolls recommended by yelpers, the H3 and the OMG roll instead of seaweed on the outside, was a fat piece of avocado or fish. Different.

The Jalapeños with crab were the tits if you like spicy!

The H3 roll was spicy and creamy. I really liked it. The OMG roll is a bit of a show, I found the smoked flavour a little sickening, but nothing terrible.

Service was first class and the owner is a real character."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place has such high ratings on yelp? Went for dinner last night. We ordered edamame to start and it was cold and some pieces were still frozen! I don't like to return food so we just kept it on our table. The sushi was not great. It was okay. Some were better than others but I was not impressed. When We got finished eating we were still in conversation and the workers kept asking us if we wanted more food and we kept saying no. Then one waitress claps her hands loudly (interrupting our conversation) and again asks us if we wanted to eat more. We felt rushed so we left. I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I was passing through AZ and decided to try a little sushi place in downtown. I'm so glad I did. Harumi is 5 stars across the board. 
They have a huge selection of sushi, as well as other dishes that will suit anyone. All of the rolls are reasonably priced and in line with most sushi restaurants. 

The sushi itself was delicious!  Very fresh and each bite had the perfect amount of each intended flavor for the roll. 

The service was the best I've had in years. It's the type of place where your glass doesn't get below half way before it's refilled. Empty dishes were whisked away in a flash. Cannot wait to go back to AZ to try them again."}
{"text":"Came here on a warm summer night and it was quite warm inside the restaurant as well (a little stuffy) aside from that the sushi was really nice and fresh.  Too bad they don't serve mixed drinks but they do have some bottled Japanese beer.  The food came out quickly and wait staff was courteous. However we asked for a box and we're clearly finished eating and after about 10 min we finally asked for the check. (It was not busy and the waiter walked by several times already) he came back with the check, and walked away for about another 10 minutes. Lol.  The was a little frustrating being that the place wasn't busy and is small enough to see that we were ready to pay. None the less I would definitely go back for the sushi."}
{"text":"Their sushi is delicious. Their service is great and prompt. The food came out quickly. Love the omg roll and the presentation the staff does along with it."}
{"text":"Wow.... Had the seat in front of the master chief and he was entertaining, both in the prep and conversation. Had the Oh my God and the H3 roll and nothing can compete with either of them. From the crunch yet complex textures of the crab, avocado, eel and flying fish eggs - to the burst of flak its - this is a thing of beauty from the first bite. Oh my God is a MUST buy.

The H3 is at the other end of the scale and more subtle that the Oh my God, but equally as good. The contrasting red fish eggs and bright avocado colours alone are worth getting the H3 dish. This will be hard to beat - and to think it is here in the desert. Wish I could bring this home with me."}
{"text":"Best sushi in AZ that's not outrageously expensive; I haven't been to another place since. All the sashimi I've had here is great, and the rolls are more exciting than most. The spicy scallop roll is amazing! I get the chef's choice sashimi appetizer every time too. The servers and chefs are friendly and accommodating.  We frequently are offered complementary items as well. Make sure to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix! Sex in the City roll, Arizona roll &  Vegas roll all amazing. Have been there twice and will keep going for the rest of eternity.
Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"Came out from california to check this place out. Let me say it was so delicious! I had the unagi, nigari salmon, Dynamite roll, and rainbow roll. It was all to die for. The service from the staff wasn't so great which is why i'm giving it four stars, but I must say the owner Juno is awesome! He came to our table and introduced himself to us and told us how they've only been here for 1 1/2 year. He was very nice and kind. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is the best sushi in Phoenix and probably the best sushi I've ever had. I have only been for lunch and it's always a madhouse so the service is kind of all over the place but it's completely worth it. I definitely recommend asking for real wasabi instead of the paste. They have it by request and man, it is so good. Their lunch specials are more than reasonable and their rolls are pretty big. I always go hungry and always leave with food in hand due to my eyes being bigger than my belly. There are sushi spots all over the valley, do yourself a favor if you want outstanding fish and go here. It's not romantic or charming but the food is top notch. I normally get a lunch platter which will give you a little of everything (sashimi, rolls, etc) then an order of jalapeno poppers. The poppers are insane. They half a whole jalapeno, stuff it with crab mix then tempura batter it and do a quick flash fry. I'm getting hungry thinking about them. Anyway, I highly recommend this spot. Parking stinks as it's downtown but it is still worth it."}
{"text":"The Sushi was fresh tasting and with and came quickly despite the full crowd. I didn't think it was a very clean looking establishment but the food was great. The value of the rolls are great compared to what we pay at other establishments. The staff was friendly and quick with service."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in the valley that I have come across. Ive tried many here and this is the one place that makes  sushi that is on par with or better than the good sushi places in CA. Dont let the purple rice scare you away, the fish is fresh and the rolls are amazing.  They have a really good lunch special on top of that and they make it as quick as possible so you can get back to work on time."}
{"text":"SO stinkin' good!! The Jalapeño poppers were cooked to perfection, and the OMG roll lived up to the hype. Good service, even better food. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical when I saw the limited manu, but then our first plate arrived.  Good presentation, fresh wasabi, and creative sauces.  Add to that an attentive staff and a interactive chef.  We are so coming back!  Thank you Juno!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"I was at the Convention Center for a conference and found this place on Yelp.  I ducked in during a break to grab some sushi to go.  They had a good selection of freshly made sushi ready to- go.
I grabbed a spicy tuna roll and an avocado wrapped California roll.  Pretty basic but the sushi was really good.  They used this black or purple rice which is really unique and gives a sweetness to the overall taste of the roll. 
The employees were all really friendly and nice do I would definitely recommend this spot if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great food but HORRIBLE service! The servers just simply don't care about the customers. I order here for pick up all from time to time and there is no point in ordering ahead of time. It took an additional 20 minutes to get my 1 roll done when I had ordered it 20 min prior to getting there. This happens maybe 2 out of 3 times. Stupid and frustrating!"}
{"text":"Pros: yay! We're huge fans! I got the sushi that they flambé and I loved it. Great smoky flavor. The purple rice is what we use at home, so I liked that took. Takes credit cards. 

Cons: parking a pain."}
{"text":"Not only did it take 40 minutes to get 2 spicy tuna rolls, but once I reviewed my banking transactions I realized they overcharged me. Probably helped themselves to a tip I did not authorize."}
{"text":"OMG The OMG Roll!! Delightful presentation, and something different than you will find at any other sushi place. It's a small space, but a pretty solid food find in downtown PHX."}
{"text":"Juno (the sushi chef) is Awesome!

I was visiting from NYC for the PPA Convention and Yelp said I had to try this place. I actually arrived a little before opening but the staff was very kind and allowed me to order. I ordered a lot... Juno actually gifted me 2 complimentary Miso Soups because I said I was bringing Sushi back to NYC. I was too embarrassed to tell him I was ordering for one hahaha. 

The stuffed Jalapeno Popper was INCREDIBLE. 
Ack! I don't remember the other 2 or 3 rolls I ordered but these rolls were crazy good! And the portions were HUGE! I love how they use Purple Rice. I wish we had Harumi in NYC. I wish I wish I wish!"}
{"text":"We love our sushi! This place did not have the usuals we tend to order and we tried a couple of new items. First impression was that there was only purple rice, yummy but did not appear to be as sticky. We had a philly roll, one with a cucumber outside and the ahi tower. The cucumber roll was very refreshing but pretty wide hence difficult to eat in one piece. The ahi tower was actually not a roll. It was a pile of sushi roll ingredients. It had a good spicey kick to it, it was delish but difficult for me to eat with chop sticks. Overall very nommy and therefore a busy place. The shouting of the staff for birthdays and closing time was a bit off-putting though."}
{"text":"The sushi is usually good but always poor customer service. The waitresses hover over your table waiting to snatch anything they think you might be done with, even if you aren't, it's like they're trying to rush you out the door. If they get your order wrong it's always your fault. Went in once with a friend, all single and double tables were taken, there were 3 booths open that sat 4 people, they would NOT give us one of those booths, they told us they were ONLY for parties of 4, so they made us stand there 10-15 minutes (no waiting area to sit in) until one of the other tables became available. I would have left but it was 110 degrees outside and I was on lunch hour, didn't feel like wandering to find another spot to eat last minute. I might have understood had there only been 1 booth left and they wanted to hold it in case a party of 4 came in, but there were 3 booths, and not  SINGLE one of those booths was taken at any point during our visit, we ate and left and all 3 booths remained open -__- such poor business sense and customer service, I understand if they like to seat 4 people at a 4 person booth, but when you have 3 open, seat your waiting customers!"}
{"text":"Great place close to the stadium. Husband and kids liked it and they have varied taste. We told them we were going to the basketball game and they were super fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating at Harumi for the first time last night. We were starving and craving sushi when we arrived around 7:00 (it was a Thursday) and were so sad that there was a line out of the door! We decided to go down the street for a couple of drinks and come back later, I'm so glad we did!  We came back around 8:45 and got a table right away. The service was AMAZING and the food was even better. We had a couple of rolls and a sashimi sampler, so fresh and so tasty! Chef Juno came out to greet us and gave us complimentary green tea ice cream and it was delightful! 
This is definitely  our new fave sushi spot!"}
{"text":"A great take on chef's choice was the Omakaze. For only $35? Why not? Such a great variety of fresh seafood. To top it off? Staff was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is so good I don't even want to review it as a five star because of the crowds it may draw to the restaurant. This place is great for a lunch or dinner date. Kids love the OMG roll. I love their Ahi Tower and black rice. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to hit up Ra... I wanted to try something new and I used Yelp to decide. This place was super affordable. It was quiet. And the food was spectacular!  I dont do reviews a lot unless it deserves it. Consider this my way of saying: \"Do not go anywhere else for sushi\". 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great place for weekday lunch. Good portion for lunch bento with options of various kind of side dishes."}
{"text":"Sushi?  In the middle of the desert???

I took my skeptical visiting Bay Area friends to this joint and they became believers.  It's not a mirage.  It's rare but possible.  Harumi Sushi, yummy.  I've been there three times in the last week.  Chef Juno is amazing and adorable.  Talk to him about what's fresh and order it.  Just say Omakase.  What a treat... blue fin tuna and o-toro (fatty tuna) were specials that night. Try their Oasis Roll + 6 piece sashimi combo.  It is an incredible smoking deal at $16.  The roll itself has cucumber wrapping, no rice, filled with fresh fish, sometimes called the Lollipop Roll at other places .  The 6 pieces of sashimi will vary, but we got delicious salmon belly, hamachi, and lightly seared albacore, which were all delicious.  At some other trendy places, just the cucumber-wrapped roll  or just the sashimi would be $16,  so this is a screaming deal for both together at $16...  and the Omakase was just $35 which was a great deal since it included high end fish like the o-toro.  Other memorable food items, the Oh My God roll, if you want to mix up the palette from all of the raw fish with some creamy goodness in the form of a table-fired tempura shrimp/unagi roll, the spicy sashimi salad, and the real wasabi.  It's $2 for a small portion but not every place has it so I'm always impressed when they do.  If you've never tried it, you should.  It's like chunky bits of wasabi meets capers.  You don't add it to your soy sauce like the normal powdery wasabi, just add a few chunks on top of each bite.  This place is definitely for foodies.  It's not about the scene here.  In fact... I'm debating whether I should be sharing this secret with you.   I don't want it to get too crowded or the prices to go up, but fine... I'll share.  :-)"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, yellowtail was to die for, and the service and staff was impeccable, great staff and owners!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are huge foodies and we have been to many sushi restaurants around the valley but none worth writing a review for. In all honesty no other sushi compares to the ones at this spot. Our favorites are finding Nemo and the spider roll."}
{"text":"The (?) owner was so awesome. Got the birthday girl free stuff, and always checking up, cracking jokes. The sushi is well priced, and unique - they use \"black rice\" Everything tasty and in the heart of down town. Will be going again and again when wanting sushi downtown."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. You must try the sexy crab. Great service. Everyone was incredibly nice. Fastest sushi I have ever had."}
{"text":"This place rocks. I'm in town for work and it was right next to my hotel. I came in on a Friday night and they were slammed. Got us a table pretty quickly and food came out quickly.

The fish was fresh but the best part is the black rice which I've never seen at a sushi place but they also have real wasabi. 

Even better the prices aren't bad at all. Great find."}
{"text":"I am really, really uncertain between 2 and 3.

This is an Americanized sushi place. Nothing here has anything to do with Japan, even sashimi is cut in huge slabs. Rolls are an horror of sauces and weird serving methods (one is flambeed in tin foil...).

However at the end of the day I didn't have a bad experience. Food was reasonable if weird, and service okay."}
{"text":"This was the best sushi in Phoenix in my opinion.  For the price and quality you can't beat Harumi.  We loved everything that we tried on the sushi and sashimi menu."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. We were impressed with both classic sushi rolls and speciality rolls. The purple rice was a nice touch. Tempura sauce is best I've had. While it had the presentation of a nicer restaurant, the price was comparable to most happy hours. The check-in deal originally lured us in (free miso & edamame). A bit \"close-quartered\" for groups, more of a good date or meeting spot. Would definitely recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"We come to Phoenix every year for Spring Training but have never had sushi so we thought we would give it a shot. I tried for a reservation earlier in the day and they were booked, but still taking walk-ins so we just chanced it. We waited about 15mins for a table, not bad at all. 

The staff was nice, but not overly friendly. They also forgot part of our order (edamame and miso soup) which we just ended up canceling because all our rolls had already come out. I was impressed with how quickly stuff come out after we ordered.

They use black rice which was an interesting experience. My friend thought it tasted a little sweeter but I didn't really notice a difference. I got their taster roll so I could try a few pieces of 3 different rolls - why don't all sushi place do this?!?!? So brilliant. 

The space could use a little rearranging and they should find a better place for their storage. We were given the table in the very back, squeezed in between all their boxes of booze (which was also a narrow path to the bathroom). That was a little annoying. 

Overall it was a good experience and I would come back."}
{"text":"This place takes sushi to another level for Phoenix. The pricing was extremely fair for an a la carte establishment and the food was delicious. The rice threw us off a little at first on account that it's purple but it tasted so so good. The definitive selling point though is the 'Oh My God' roll... It comes out to you on fire!! What more can you ask for. Great customer service and quick, delicious food."}
{"text":"Delicious rainbow roll and the purple rice was tasty too. I loved the free miso soup and edamame. The seaweed was good enough.  Four stars for this establishment."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch kind of small place but otherwise great. Fast and friendly service, great sushi. Loved the salmon and yellowtail sashimi I ordered. Definately recommending this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"I just popped by for grab and go sushi for the first time. 

I think I discovered the cheapest, fastest, biggest, yummiest lunch in downtown Phoenix.

I grabbed the California roll sampler (3 plain, 6 spicy, 6 crunchy). You wanna start with the go-to stuff when trying something out for the first time. It was 7 dollars! And there are 15 pieces! Man was it good too. A little eel sauce on the crunchy was great. Spicy had heat and flavor. Plain was a good staple. 

I plan on going back many times. Next I want the orange roll (california with masago on top) or their sushi lunch special. I don't recall prices over $10 in the grab and go case. It's really a yummy lunch if you just want to head back and eat at your desk.

Great job Harumi,  you made a regular out of me."}
{"text":"Love this place and their purple rice! If you're looking for a casual spot downtown to get some really good sushi this is the one. Don't visit without getting the flaming Oh My God roll."}
{"text":"My first time here, I am glad I came to the right place. I had the Oh My God Roll which is their special item, salmon sashimi and combo rolls. All delicious"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot in Arizona! It's worth the drive. I live in Gilbert area, but drive to downtown Phoenix for Harumi Sushi. If you want fresh fish and great service, this is the spot to be. Restaurant is small, cozy, and seems like always busy every time I come here.  Definitely has a moms and pops atmosphere. There is a line, but it goes by pretty quickly and worth the wait. Chef Juno is awesome and is always is good spirits! The Must try is the OMG roll! It will make you shout \"OMG!\" And they also have fresh real wasabi which is rare to find at sushi restaurants. Ive never been disappointed. The prices are reasonable. I love Harumi ! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"So disappointing, we were so excited to eat here again. We waited around 20 minutes and the servers were not communicating with the hostess and let a walk-in couple sit before those waiting outside."}
{"text":"Harumi Sushi is by far my new favorite place to grab sushi here in the Valley.  I went with a group of 10 people, and not one person had a bad food experience.

To start, the rice is purple.  Yes.....PURPLE!  Apparently, it is a black rice that turns purple once cooked and is filled with extra antioxidants and other components that are good for you.  And trust me, even if it wasn't good for me I'd still be asking for it.  I don't know what it is, but it is phenomenal!

The dishes we shared were the Ahi Stack, Spicy Scallop roll, and Salmon Sashimi.   Holy moly; the Ahi Stack was unlike anything I've ever eaten.  I thought it was a roll, but instead it is a mountain of ahi tuna, crab and spicy sauce on top of a mound of purple rice topped with fresh avocado and roe.  We inhaled it, and will definitely get it again.  And the salmon is the most buttery, fresh salmon I have ever had in the valley.  They top it with their homemade fresh wasabi, which was also fabulous!

I docked 1 star because when we went to pay there was a lot of confusion and some people received their bills, some didn't, some didn't get their cards back for awhile.....it was a cluster, but definitely forgivable.

If you love sushi, I definitely say run, Run, RUN to Harumi!!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best sushi I've had in Phoenix. We learned about this place from a food tour and had to try it. Definitely can't go wrong with the chefs choice and the Nemo Roll. The OMG roll was uber fun to watch and something totally different. I can't get into the smoking flavor though but that's just my personal opinion. The fish was so fresh and the services was stellar. Would definitely go back for a special occasion but my pocketbook can't handle this being a frequent drop in"}
{"text":"Sushi here was really great! Especially the spicy sashimi salad. The OMG roll was too much of a hype. There was too much going on with the roll. Didn't know what I was tasting. Everything else was amazing! The restaurant is a bit small so the wait can be long if they're packed."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and delicious. Strongly recommend. But you probably need to wait a little bit long time since it is usually crowded"}
{"text":"Question:

What is half the price of Nobu and 3x as good, located in the desert and an incredible value?

Answer: Harumi Sushi in downtown Phoenix!

This place truly rocks. I had three dishes:

A spicy sashimi salad
A spicy yellowtail tuna nigiri
A spicy soft shell crab roll with purple rice

It's hard for me to quantify the wonderful array of textures and flavors in each of the items I had. But I can assure you that the quality of their ingredients, the array of textures in each dish and the pure taste, texture and flavor phenomena is a wonderful experience. 

You have to give these guys a try. Truly wonderful."}
{"text":"Perfect sushi experience. Sashimi excellent. Iron noodle soup perfect. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I stumbled on this place while looking for good, affordable sushi and we were really impressed. The location was great, the sushi was amazingly delicious and the service was on par. This is the best sushi place I've been to in Phoenix and rivals the best ones I've been to in California. Most definitely a great place!!"}
{"text":"Walked into Harumi for the first time this weekend and was greeted right away! The staff is friendly, welcoming and helpful, and the sushi is pretty good as far as sushi in Arizona goes. This is not your gourmet sushi restaurant; they serve traditional and a few fun rolls in a simple, yet appealing style. Their grab and go sushi also makes for a quick and healthy lunch option for employees in the downtown area! I ordered a lunch bento box with bulkogi beef and they loaded my plate up with fried rice, house salad, veggies and tofu! Not really the type of bento I'm used to but it was a good sized portion and really tasty!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good spot for sushi. They're Las Vegas roll was amazing!!! The service was also good."}
{"text":"Love the sushi! I agree with others that this is probably the best sushi anywhere. But trust me--stick to the sushi for a 5-star review. The other menu items are 'meh'. For instance, the miso soup has been sitting prepared too long, so the onions were soggy (they should be added just before serving) and the gyoza is another unfortunate Phoenix creation: deep fried. Ugh. If you want really good homemade gyoza that's also cooked properly (slightly pan fried on one side and left to steam on the other)--head next door to the Noodle Bar... 1 of like 2 restaurants in the whole valley that makes it right. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now but every experience I've had has been excellent. The service is fast and friendly but not bothersome. They really understand that as diners we are trying to enjoy the food without too much interruption. The menu is not too expansive but the few things they have are done quite well.
I like to start off with yellowtail sashimi. With 8 pieces costing $12 it's a pretty good deal. Additionally the fish was a nice temperature and tasted fresh and tender. Each roll that I've tried has also been a delight. First off the Oh My God roll has a smokey eel flavor that is not overwhelming but compliments the rest of the ingredients well. The H3 has a spicy kick that most japanese restaurants don't have, it might be a korean thing. The caterpillar roll is melt in your mouth from the fresh avocado to the eel. I've had the chance to try the mango crunch roll which has a sweetness to it mostly from eel sauce, the mango I found was a bit tart and made the roll a delightfully light flavor. The oasis is covered with cucumber instead of their signature purple rice, it's cooling and refreshing for summer, but I'm not a huge fan of that much tuna. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone that has a standard for raw fish."}
{"text":"I tried this place out for the first time a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised! We live near the down town area and needed a good sushi place close by, so we found this one. It's small and not too easy to spot, but I was glad we found it. Inside was small, we were seated inches away from another couple right in front of the sushi bar, so it was a little distracting hearing everyone's conversations in our ears. Our server was from Japan and was very attentive and sweet. We tried a few rolls and some ngiri and we were surprised to see that the rice was purple! It was not only beautiful, it was delicious! The server explained that they use this special rice that is black before it cooks and it used to be only served to royals. This place was great and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was very good!  The sushi was fresh and well prepared. I ordered three rolls and they were not skimpy by any means. 

I would go back and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Omakase and fresh wasabi. That's all you need. The omakase (chef's choice) is probably thee best one I've had and I'm comparing it to some great places in LA. A bit different in that it all comes at one time instead of one at a time but I had no problem with that. And the price?! OMG!! ONLY  $35!!!!! What a deal. What a steal. And you will leave pretty full. 

And fresh wasabi. You should definitely try it if you haven't yet. I can't stand the paste but eating it fresh is a whole different experience. It's worth the drive to downtown."}
{"text":"Excellent! Nice surprise to find this place near the hotel. I recommend the OMG roll and deep fried calamari!"}
{"text":"What. A. Gem.

I was downtown on 12/26 and quickly learned half of all of the restaurants were closed for the day, so I stumbled upon this place. I called to make sure they were open and they answered quickly! Plus one.

I eat sushi occasionally- not often. It needs to be done right, and in Arizona- that's tough.

My husband and I sat down, and seared salmon nigiri with a slight kick was placed at our table within minutes. We were so confused at first at their generosity! My husband and I aren't used to complementary service at restaurants, so that was an extra treat!

I love salmon, so I ordered some simple nigiri. He offered real Wasabi on the side. Omg. That IS real Wasabi!!

My husband got the Oasis roll, and ohhhhhh boy, was that a hit! Cucumber wrap?! Gimme! SO refreshing! The table next to us asked us what wrap we got, because that's how unique it is!

We also split the fried dumplings, gyoza, and they were SO delicious.

Service, food and atmosphere was amazing. Prices were also very good for the quality, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wow my fiance and I have been here twice now. First time around noon on a Monday wasn't bad for a crowd the grab and go had already been cleaned out. We stayed for a rainbow roll and I loved it so much the purple rice is so pretty I felt so good after eating it. The second time was right when it opened at 11am on  Tuesday which was nice. I tried real Wasabi which is OMG amazing! I had no idea it would be so good ! The seaweed salad was also perfect. This place is definately my favorite spot to get sushi."}
{"text":"6 Stars!! Seriously the best Sushi experience I have had - at normal prices.  In fact, save the swanky ambience of an upscale sushi joint, this place tops even those in service and, most importantly, food quality. Note: I'm not saying the place doesn't have a nice style - but it's not super sushi snob either(which I'm FINE with).
What's the best thing about this place? They use Black Rice!!! So much tastier and much much MUCH better for you than junk husk white rice - if you don't believe me do some 'Googlin!
I had the \"Chef's Choice\" - 5 Nigiri, 6 Sashimi, plus Oasis roll for $27.  The fish was very fresh, great taste, and good quality(high fat, great color in the tuna particularly).  This order was a perfect meal size. It almost seemed like there was much more than what is listed.  The Oasis roll is very large.
I also had a Stuffed Jalapeño - excellent!
The staff were extremely attentive - my water glass never went more than half empty and I was parched. The sushi came quick but I could see the master sushi chef expertly cutting away at it.  He also sent out some tempura fish as a bonus."}
{"text":"I've gotten take-out here twice, and it's been great both times. The sweet potato maki was the best I've ever had (seasoned perfectly), and the fish was fresh and well-proportioned. The purple rice is tasty and looks beautiful. Service was friendly and very quick. This is probably the best sushi I've had in Phx."}
{"text":"Once again my fellow; thank you! If it's been a while since you've been downtown make sure to allow yourself extra time to find a place to park and find to this place. All of the one way streets made parking a little tricky. I arrived around 4:30p and asked the hostess if they could prepare for a party of 10. I had four out of ten of us that arrived on time and they said we couldn't be seated until our entire party arrives. We were all thirsty and started to talk about going somewhere else and that's when we think the owner said we could sit down. I didn't think this was a good start. Now moving on to the appetizers, sushi and mochi. We ordered shrimp tempura and the stuffed jalapeños. The shrimp was very fresh and the tempura batter was seasoned well, very light and crispy. The stuffed jalapeños were slightly spicy but the crab filling balanced out the spice perfectly. We tried around five different rolls. The Caterpillar roll, OMG roll, Sex in the city roll, H3 roll, and Las Vegas roll. All of the rolls were seasoned well, tasted fresh and were a perfect size to pop in your mouth. Throughout our entire meal the servers were on point with making sure our table was cleared quickly of dirty plates and refilled our drinks as soon as they noticed we were running low. Oh and the black tea is very good as well. Of course I couldn't pass on dessert which I loved. I ordered the strawberry and mango mochi. It was the perfect end to a fantastic meal. The restroom is in a strange area; you'll see what I mean. Lastly, due to the delay to sit down is the only reason I won't give them 5 stars. Otherwise the drinks and food were absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal sushi and even better service. Very attentive and courteous. Best sushi I've ever had. Try the super crunchy shrimp roll appetizer. To die for."}
{"text":"Awesome! Good attitudes, good food and thoughtful servers. You will need to try several of their signature sushis ... OMG Roll, for example, is worth the try. (It comes on a plate of flames). Some rolls seem similar. This may be due to the use of chills and seasonings. Overall, a solid sushi find. Casual...do not expect luxe settings."}
{"text":"I had dinner last night with friends and it's was simply incredible. For starters, when we placed our order, the waitress looked at the sushi order card and asked us \"have you eaten here before? Our portions are large and I think you ordered to much\".  So we took off a couple of items. She was not kidding. Rolls are 10 pieces and a generous size too. The salmon sashimi for example was maybe 1/4 thick and 3x2 inches and 6-7 pieces in the serving for about $12. Incredible value! Even though we removed a couple of items, we still way over ordered but we couldn't stop eating! A must try is an item called \"Oh My God\" roll. It's better to experience it rather than me describe it and definitely worth ordering. Go with a good appetite!"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. I stopped in for lunch because it was close to my office. The purple rice that they use is delicious and the quality of the fish they use is great.  Fresh thick cuts."}
{"text":"Our favourite sushi restaurant downtown.
It's always packed with people so usually there is a wait for a table - but it's definitely worth the wait every time.
We were a group of 7 this time and shared a number of different rolls. The California roll is nice but the favourite is always the Oh My God roll, which comes out on fire.
There is sooo much goodness in their menu and lots of great choices.
Honestly you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Best sushi EVER! And I'm from California,  I've tasted so many different types of rolls from different states and several different places here and I can say I'm extremely happy to finally have found the best sushi place ever.  They are so unique and original,  I've tried everything on their menu and my favorite is the OMG roll,  we always get it when we visit.  Great staff and just wonderful everything! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Another big let down for yelp, losing faith in AZ reviewers 

For starters, any sushi place with 4.5 stars better have some authentic stuff. This was a complete disaster from start to finish.

Server was very pushy trying to get me to order the chef special where the chef selects everything. Every question I asked was followed with the question.

Lacked knowledge in fish they serve, not a good sign.

Uses some gimmicky rice, not sure what is going on there but black rice is just not a good look, and not the standard sushi rice, another bad sign

The food: gyoza was okay, not great. It was just dropped in a fryer. Meh

Spider roll: not fresh soft-shell crap, also very skimpy on the amount. Most of the roll was crab mix... not even an ingredient in it typically.

May be good for Phoenix natives, not for anyone that has ventured out of the valley and experienced quality sushi. Big let down because the reviews had this on my watch list for a while."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Felt like I was in NYC not Phx. Very fun atmosphere! Best sushi I have had in PHX. Must get the \"oh my god\" roll!"}
{"text":"This place is good. Not great, but good. I would definitely go here again. The sushi selection isn't that vast, but I love how they top off their nigiri with fresh wasabi instead of the powdered stuff and use the purple rice. Their rolls are huge! I seriously got so stuffed from just the nigiri and roll that I seriously regretted ordering a salad and udon as well.  I think it's also cute that they have ready-made sushi rolls and nigiri for those people on the go. If I worked around this neighborhood, I would visit here and pick up a box for a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Man, oh man.  What a great place!  I first experienced Harumi while I was on jury duty.  The sushi was so nice, it actually made jury duty something to look forward to.  I forgot to write a review, even after raving about it for weeks after.  I finally made my way back to downtown again and had to have some sushi.

I'm surely not the only one who turned her nose up at the thought of sushi in the desert.  Living on the coast totally spoils you for the freshest fish possible, and the idea of sushi in Phoenix honestly sort of curled my toes a bit.  But if you're that person doubting sushi in the Sonoran, really think again and give this place a try.  The lunch specials are wonderfully priced, and you will not leave disappointed (or hungry).  Service was so friendly, and the waitress was fun and delightfully sassy - loved her!  

I'd come back here whenever I'm downtown.  And the next time you get that dreaded jury summons notice in the mail, before you think of how you can wiggle out of it, just think of Harumi and smile.  It will make doing your civic duty totally worthwhile!"}
{"text":"The only reason not a 5 was because of service. Felt extremely rushed by our waitress and was charged for soft drinks when we ordered water. Completely impressed with the lunch special served with a wonderful half roll of rainbow and Vegas roll with a kick salmon and tuna nigiri .you'll notice black rice (looks purple) is also know as \"forbidden rice\" from the ancient Chinese it was reserved for the emperors and upper class and commoners were forbidden from it. Knowing me with class and taste this was a plus and a W for my yelp review."}
{"text":"Got to the restaurant at 8:50 pm. The sign on the door says they are open until 9:00. The hostesses turned me away saying they were closed. That's just bad business. If you want to close at 8:50 then put that on your door and website so people know what to expect. I won't try again regardless of how highly others have rated them. If they can't deliver on the advertised close time I don't trust that they'll deliver a great dining experience either."}
{"text":"This dining experience was average at best. Our order took forever because the party before had such a large order. So it appears as they had just one chef for the lunch hour. 

The sushi itself was great. There were a lot of original rolls on the menu. The one thing we noticed about the drinks were that you could get the same size beer at the restaurant next door for $4 cheaper. 

I would recommend trying another option for sushi downtown if you want more ambience but if it's just good sushi to go you're looking for, not a bad option."}
{"text":"The best place for sushi in this region. It's hard to find fresh seafood in Arizona but I always enjoy the sushi here and it's my first and the only place I go to when I crave for sushi. Everyone should go to this place and get their amazing service and food. I especially like seared salmon and the spicy bluefin tuna roll which was the special. Really recommend the spicy bluefin tuna roll.  Order it if it is on the specials for that day."}
{"text":"Probably the best customer service I've ever had in Phoenix. The sushi was great too, loved everything we tried!!!!!"}
{"text":"Another fantastic dinner! Harumi is hands down the best of the low key Japanese restaurants in Phoenix. The rolls and sashimi are excellent . Honestly, I would recommend everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Just a few things brought this place down to a 3 star for me almost a 2 star. The staff is extremely pleasant and helpful, but it was a bit overwhelming having 3 different servers for our table. 
Then I went to use the rest room and it's through an exit door, down a long hallway, through a couple more doors then you reach a shared restroom by other businesses. So that was a little strange and scary. 
Then the last thing that really turned me off was that I had noticed the sushi chef had gone out the exit looking door towards the bathroom while still wearing his food prep gloves. Now I don't know where he had gone maybe to make a phone call I don't know, but he returned still wearing the gloves and went right back to preparing food for people. That right there ruined it for me."}
{"text":"I was a little confused walking in the door.  Their order set up at the register was a little chaotic, especially during a busy lunch hour.  Had to wait a bit for several empty tables to be cleared off before we could sit and our hot sake went missing, but all was forgotten when our order was (quickly) up... The sushi is gorgeous.  Tuna and salmon were some of the best I've had and the purple rice was great. If we were local, I'd make this place part of my weekly routine.  Go, go, go!  Just pick a slower time or be prepared for very minor hiccups."}
{"text":"Love this place! Sushi is always fresh. Service is usually fast even on their busy nights. Order real wasabi to go with your sushi."}
{"text":"Bomb!!! Has the spicy tuna and the stuffed jalapeño! Both spicy and light. Not told heavy! I'm coming back like after my work out"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for over a year now and I am never disappointed. The food is always fresh and yummy. If I could eat here everyday for the rest of my life, I would."}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi!  Great rolls and very fresh.  Best in town by far.  The staff is very friendly and Juno, the owner, will make some great food."}
{"text":"Stopped here directly after arriving in Phoenix.  Even though we didn't have reservations they were very accommodating for our party of 5.  So happy they were able to get us in.  We ordered Oh My God sushi and it was just as the name says.  When we placed our order the waitress asked if we were hungry because we had ordered so much.  ( Oh My God was one of 6 plates we ordered) We were hungry but still had difficulty finishing everything and took our leftovers with us.  The owners, each came to our table to make sure we were enjoying our meal.  Couldn't express our happiness with the amazing food and genuine hospitality we received.  This will be a go to place every time we visit Arizona."}
{"text":"The upside of us ordering too much at dinner was that we had plenty to take home and have a few hours later - and it tasted just as fresh!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, living in Hawaii and visiting downtown Phoenix, my expectations for ono sushi were floor level at best. I knew we had something good going when we walked in and were greeted by a Japanese waiter with a Japanese cooking show playing on the big screen. We ordered the OMG, Sex in the City, and H3 rolls, all prepared perfectly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a business trip, and i yelped around  my hotel, and found them with such good rating, i was too late last night, they were closed, but today i battled if i should come give them a try before departure since it was soooo hot outside, and it's like more them four block from Sheraton hotel when the meeting is held... and i'm so glad i came back... i was surprise by the freshness of the sashimi sampler i ordered... it tasted very good, sashimi is all about freshness and the cut, they did a great job with the cut. I didn't give five star only because i just can't take my minds off what i experienced in my Japan trip, but they're very good! From, happy customer from san francisco!"}
{"text":"Really good. Real wasabi. Interesting dark rice. Reasonable prices. Worthwhile size chirashi. Lunch specials are a bit limited. Gets packed pretty quick even at 11:30 so no groups bigger than four."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for lunch in downtown Phoenix! The food is great and always fresh."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best sushi places I've been to. It's cozy there arent many tables, the back tables are sadly seeing boxes stacked and a fridge of some sort and going to the restroom is like an adventure you must find your way through this back building maze in an old art decco style building. The bathroom reminds me of some horror flick bathroom with a frosted glass door that leads to who knows where.
But. You didn't come for the bathroom experiance...the sushi is amazing, when in this area I find it hard to not stop by. Can't go wrong with the \"oh my god\" it is delicious. 
The service is wonderfully, attentive. And the food comes fast."}
{"text":"The whole vibe was awesome! Absolutely loved the crazy roll! Definitely one of my new favorite sushi places!"}
{"text":"I love this sushi spot in downtown Phoenix!

To my surprise, they use purple rice for their rolls and entrees.  That's the first for me on sushi! 

Tasty rolls and nigiri set! I ordered up the chef's special for lunch and got the omakase for dinner!  

Popular place for dinner.  I had to wait for a good twenty to half hour, but it's worth it!  Casual attire for this surrounding, but above the notch sushi!

I like the squid nigiri, toro and hotate nigiri!  I had to ask if there was uni and they have it....off menu! Nice.  It doesn't hurt to ask.

The owner was friendly and entertaining as well as accommodating!  He took care of us with complimentary miso soup and this tuna sashimi flavored sauce dish!  He also packed me up some green edamame to go!  He was generous and funny with his visits during our dining experience! 

Ayce sushi and staff!  Recommend, yes!"}
{"text":"Good & service was a 10/10.  Great value for the quality & taste.  I keep going back for the food (which is excellent) as the ambiance is not phenomenal.  Who cares about ambiance when it tastes this good though!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place in Phoenix. Traveling from the East Coast and a little skeptical but everything was delicious! Recommend the H3 Roll and Spicy Tuna were amazing! Highly recommend this place if you're craving sushi while in Phoenix! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Leaving very happy as u can see it was an uni day for me. Always welcoming fresh food."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with yummy sushi! The purple rice took some getting use too but the Harumi and Arizona rolls were our favorite! The mini platter was a great deal, 3 rolls for $15."}
{"text":"I created a yelp account specifically so I could review this restaurant. We made the mistake of ordering appetizers...we wish we had saved room for more sushi rolls. The sushi is amazing, one of the best meals we have had on our vacation. The price is right and the Kirin is ice cold. For what this place lacks in atmosphere it makes up for with the love they put into their food. Go, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Sooooo yummy I had to try to eat extra slowly just so it would last longer. I wasn't excited about the lunch specials, it'd have been nice if there were better variety there. But I paid a bit more for what I wanted a la carte and thoroughly enjoyed it. Black rice is awesome. (I snagged a couple bites before snapping the photo)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I love the atmosphere.  The owners are fantastic.  It gets busy, but they give you sushi while you wait.  And it is fantastic.  I love sushi, I know good fish.  This is terrific.  Don't let the wait turn you away."}
{"text":"First of all, I couldn't believe the price! That, to me, was the most impressive part. I won't lie - I was a bit concerned about the strange looking rice, but I am glad I took the chance. I didn't leave a morsel left, because the rolls were just that good. The sashimi was even more delightful with no fishy odor like other places. OMG Roll was the best one we tried this time. I'm excited to go back."}
{"text":"Unique, delicious sushi. They are using forbidden rice and it's a delicious healthy rice.
Try oh my god if you want some entertainment at your table and a barbecued sushi."}
{"text":"I heard it was good from seeittryitlovit on instagram and had to try it. I loved it. Great flavors and textures. Beautiful food and the service was quick and pleasant. I'm going back."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Fast service huge rolls and fresh fish. I was here twice during my shirt stay in Phoenix love it"}
{"text":"The best service, sushi, people, atmosphere! You cannot prevent a smile from your face when you're here! Worth the wait!!!!"}
{"text":"I still crave their \"oh my god\" roll!! Been trying to find one like it in dallas. Its TOO GOOD! The restaurant itself is small. But its cute and fun. We got lucky and got the last table on an early Friday night. People were having to wait a long time for a table. Not good for big groups."}
{"text":"This place has fresh sushi with moderate prices but no happy hour...THEY DEFINITELY NEED THIS. I've never heard of a restaurant without a happy hour and also the waiter dropped off the check while I was eating I definitely felt rushed"}
{"text":"I went to Harumi while I was on a business trip to Phoenix.  It's a small place, nothing fancy, but convenient and reasonably priced.  They tend toward the rolls more than a la carte, and use \"forbidden rice\" instead of white rice.  They have some creative rolls...the \"Oh My God\" roll is interesting, as it comes out flaming.  Fun.  Service was good, and it's a little unusual in their preparation.  If you're looking for traditional sushi, this may not be the place for you, but if you'd like something different, it's a cool place."}
{"text":"I think we found our favorite sushi spot in Downtown phx. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food is great and the prices are on point. Our friends told us about this place a couple months back so we decided to try it out. Glad we did!"}
{"text":"We arrived and it was packed! We decided to wait and I am so glad we did! Food was outstanding the service was wonderful and they never seemed stressed or rushed in spite of it being crazy busy. Sushi was so fresh and incredibly yummy!"}
{"text":"The best sushi spot in AZ, this hidden hole in the wall gem is absolutely delicious, with the freshest fish and best customer service.... I mean how often do you see owner coming up to the table to greet you and ask how everything is! Everything is delicious especially love their big eye tuna and toro and specialty rolls! Must try for those that like original spots"}
{"text":"Super delicious and extra refreshing sushi place in Phoenix. I usually get a little hesitant when sushi places get a little creative with their sushi and by that I mean not using the right rice or drenching a roll in too much mayo, but this place was creative in their presentation. I loved the black rice in my roll. It gave it a super soft texture and a different twist. The Oasis roll was my all time favorite. It was wrapped in cucumber so the water of the cucumber added extra freshness to the roll. All the seafood I had here was fresh as well. Being in a dessert it's hard to gauge how good seafood will be but it was super great here."}
{"text":"I drive 1/2 hr  and pay for parking to eat here. Everytime I go, I can't wait to go back.
So tasty and fresh!!"}
{"text":"In town for work and heard raves about this place so I decided to check it out on a weeknight around 8. There was a 20 minute wait but I was able to get seating at the bar as a solo. 

Based on other reviews and my husbands recommendation, I ordered two of the seared salmon nigiri and also the OMG roll. I have to say both were incredible. Tasty, satisfying, fresh, interesting, and altogether delicious. The seared salmon had a touch of spice which I normally don't like, but it was beautiful as part of the overall taste. The salmon melts in your mouth. The OMG presentation was cool but the flavor was even better and I loved the combination of the cooked bottom and cool top. 

Easily the best sushi I've ever had. The staff are attentive and friendly. I love that! Only one critical observation - I wish the ambiance was a little cozier. it's pretty dive-y which is only appropriate  for super casual dining. Still, five stars."}
{"text":"GREAT rolls and generous portions. Casual dining atmosphere. The service was very friendly and helpful. This was our first time here but we've already decided this is our new go to spot for sushi. We came here because of the good reviews on yelp and they lived up to and exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"In town for business and found this place - what a gem!  Best sushi at great prices (and I'm from Los Angeles).  I highly recommend to avid sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Sad to say my last visit to my fav sushi place was not as awesome as previous experiences..keep reading. 
My sis and I have been coming here for over 2 years, she works nearby. She is kinda picky about her fish, so she ordered a roll without tuna and added mango. Now the price of the roll with the regular ingredients is like 10 bucks, no problem there. But she asked for NO Tuna, ADDED Mango and was charged 2 bucks extra...wtf. Yes its only 2 dollars but why? 
They must need the money...not cool Harumi, not cool."}
{"text":"All I have to show of my visit is an empty plate. Some of the best sushi I have ever had.  Wow. 

I opted for the Omakase which means, \"I'll leave it up to you\". They didn't disappoint with a collection of top grade sushi and sashimi. If you're feeling adventurous, you will follow suit!"}
{"text":"Great hand made fresh wasabi, interesting twist with the purple rice - you have to stop thinking about it and then you'll realize there's no perceptible change in flavor.  My daughter ordered an 8 piece Sake (salmon) Nigiri and the pieces were super large and fresh, best ever she said and she orders it everywhere."}
{"text":"The art of the purple roll. Best sushi I've had. Wife was craving sushi and needed her fix. Came in right before they closed and it was packed. Luckily got right in, had great service. I had the OMG roll and oh my dad was it great. Had a smoky taste, came out on fire, all boxes were checked. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi spot! They have incredible lunch specials that are very reasonable price-wise. I enjoyed one of their lunch specials that came with miso soup, a rainbow roll, and dynamite roll, and two pieces of nigiri. All of that was only $13 which is great for sushi. I also added an order of edamame for an additional $3. I was very impressed with the quality of the sushi. The fish was so fresh and almost melted in your mouth."}
{"text":"Unfriendly restaurant to families with young kids/babies. We waited exactly 1 hr and 15 min for our table. They keep telling us we are next on the list, but they continue to give away tables to others and claiming those tables are inappropriate for my toddler. I was really hoping that their food would be the saving grace of the evening, but I was disappointed there too. Here is a list of all we ordered.
-Crunch mango roll - hot mess of different ingredients forced together in overly sweet eel sauce and no mango flavor = avoid
-H3 roll - the 3 spicy fish complemented each other well along with masago = order
-Oh My God - cooked hot mess in that overly sweet eel sauce again = avoid at all cost
-Mini Roll Combo - Rainbow, Crazy rolls were average but edible. Spider was unrecognizable?! The soft shell crab was hidden inside this huge gob of imitation crab salad. No soft shell crab was visible from outside. I had to ask the waiter what it was.
Overall, we were very disappointed in the food and service from one individual. I came here due to the high rating and number of reviews. I should of turned around when I did not see one Asian customer in the entire restaurant. If you want good Japanese sushi, then avoid this place. If you want unrecognizable American rolls, where you can barely taste the fish, then come here."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. There are far better sushi restaurants in Phoenix/Glendale than this place.

My husband and I are sushi lovers and are always trying new sushi restaurants. We traveled 40 minutes from Surprise to try this out. We were disappointed.

The rice they use is black/purple and DOES NOT taste like sushi rice. It doesn't taste right and it makes the rolls taste abnormal. At every sushi restaurant, we always make sure we get the rainbow roll to gauge the quality of their raw fish.Their raw fish is okay.. definitely not great quality, but not the worst either.

If you love rolls with lots of sauce, then this place is for you. I, personally, don't like TOO MUCH sauce on my specialty rolls... just a little is enough for me. But they DRENCH those suckers so much that all you taste is sauce with weird black/purple rice. 

There DINNER MENU is very small... and does NOT include bento boxes. All they have are rolls, sashimi, ramen, and the typical appetizers. Their LUNCH menu, on the other hand, have bento boxes.

Last but not least, the PRICE is a little more than what I'm used to for the same quality. The \"SPECIAL\" we were offered for uni/sea urchin was $5 per ONE piece. That's a little expensive. I can get good uni/sea urchin at \"Sushi Catcher\" for $8 per TWO large pieces. 

FYI, be prepared to pay for parking since it is located downtown-ish. It costs $1.50 per hour for meter parking.

We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Cute little Japanese restaurant , well priced. We had stuffed jalapeños and dumplings for appetizers. My favorite roll was H3, very refreshing. We also got OMG and sex and the city roll , way too much food for two people to share , but we totally enjoyed that. Only thing that we would advice the owner : customers can everything you say, talking in front of us with a waiter about last nights problems I front of us wasn't a good idea. We do understand that things happen but we are here to enjoy food and 1st time experience and we really don't need to know all the details. It should been discussed in the back , that kind of experience just was little uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I was surprised but delighted to find some of the best sushi I've had in a while here in Phoenix (Yelp delivers once again!). Some friends and I were in town for a conference downtown and this was just a short walk from our hotel. The wait on a busy Friday night was only 15 minutes or so, and service was impeccable. The owner stops by to say hi to every table and even sang happy birthday to one guest. 

Now for the food - we were starving and all of our food came out remarkably fast once we had ordered. The combos are incredible deals! For $15, you can choose 3 mini-rolls (about 5 pieces each) out of several select signature rolls - if you're like me and want to try a bit of everything, this is perfect. I got the crazy, rainbow, and spider rolls, and all of them were amazing. The fish (especially salmon) was extremely fresh and together it was very flavorful and filling. They also had roll + 5 nigri or 6 sashimi combos for $15-$16, which 2 of my friends got and also really enjoyed. 

Would definitely come back and try some of their other delicious-looking rolls!"}
{"text":"Innovative sushi rolls. This place makes phenomenal sushi. We ordered 4 rolls, all of which were pretty amazing. They use purple rice which is very healthy. The OMG roll is super entertaining. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best sushi spots in Phoenix. They use black rice that turns purple when cooked. Fish taste fresh and the size of the sushi rolls are just right. Ordered salmon sashimi, the cuts of salmon were bigger than most sushi places. Not a very big place but the staff is friendly and the sushi chefs know what they are doing. A pleasant visit, will definitely be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Sushi done right! What an amazing experience we had here! This breaks the glass ceiling for 5 star restaurants, from the moment we walked in and were greeted to past the moment we walked out when Chef Juno magically appeared on the sidewalk to say goodbye one more time, we were treated like celebrities.

On the morning after, I was still saying OMG to the heavenly taste sensations, including the unique smoky flavor of the OMG roll. How will any sushi compare to this? It won't. I'll never be able to go anywhere else! But then who would want to?"}
{"text":"Finally! We have found our sushi spot in Arizona. After moving from California and trying 6 different sushi restaurants in the area we thought we were doomed to mexican food and pizza forever. I literally said this was the last place i would try sushi and if it wasn't good then I would throw in the sushi towel.

OMG! DELICIOUS! AUTHENTIC! ATTENTION TO DETAIL! FRESH!!

The owner/sushi chef was so entertaining and really takes care of his customers. Everyone in the restaurant was brought a complimentary lightly seared tuna tataki with ponzu and thanked by him personally for coming in. I was hesitant to eat sushi with black rice but I am officially converted. While white rice has that chewiness and bounce back to it, the black \"purple\" rice was tender with the just the right amount of resistance to complement the melt in your mouth buttery fish. It felt way less heavy than white rice and the fact that its healthier makes me feel a little better about stuffing my face with sushi.

GET THE FRESH WASABI! So worth the $2. I am officially spoiled. There is no going back to that powdered crap now. Its got such a fresh bite to it and it doesn't overpower the sushi like normal powdered wasabi does. We also got the Sex and the City roll, spicy tuna roll, and eel nigiri. They accidentally brought us the crunchy crab roll too and let us keep it no extra charge of course. Everything was amazing.
We also got the spicy shrimp tempura ramen too (our eyes were bigger than our stomaches, and yes we got togo bags, were not sumo wrestlers!)
I only wish they would set the shrimp tempure off to the side and not have it sitting in the ramen because it got soggy quick. I would probably just stick with sushi next time.

TIP: Don't pay $12 for parking. The parking meters are free during the weekdays, we parked in front of the courthouse a block away for free, lots of open spaces to park.

WE WILL BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, I was there for the first time. My experience started when the waiter told me and my wife, \" I think this is a lot of food, this roll is similar to this one, let's remove it for now, and we can add it later \". I think this is an indication that this place cares about your experience and to this level of details. 
I love the food , it is not similar to other sushi places, they have their own signature. I was happy to be there at3:45 , 15 minutes before they open and there were three groups of people waiting outside, it is amazing to have people waiting for you to open.
The waiters are very friendly, you feel you are very welcomed. The location is very good, the price is very reasonable and the food is awesome."}
{"text":"If there's a wait, wait. Absolutely nothing wrong with this place. Salmon was like butter and every roll was delicious and creative!  Purple rice made everything feel new and different. Finding Nemo roll highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Fresh tasty artfully assembled dishes. Very hip ambiance. Lovely wait staff. Highly recommended. A gem in the desert."}
{"text":"it amazes me that this place has such a high rating. 

most items on the menu are either drenched in spicy mayo, involve tempura, or are deep-fried. or a combination of the three. thus, the sublime subtle taste of fish that i pine for and dream of was brutally stamped out and strangled by this unnecessary traitorous engulfment of lesser ingredients. 

it is a shame really because i love the color purple, so i was excited for purple rice. 

there's a billion other better sushi spots in the valley. this place has been tricking people by deep frying its own mediocrity and drenching it in a mayo of cheap tricks and distractions. So, if you enjoy sushi because you enjoy fish, go somewhere else

let the fish speak. #imwithfish"}
{"text":"Been here twice now, both of those times they completely forgot my wifes order, big party both of those times you would think they would take extra care of us because the place as never been crazy busy any of the times I have been. The purple rice they use and some of the rolls are amazing but I would steer away from fried rice it was bland and the teriyaki chicken was a disappointment. Stick to the sushi and sashimi they are where this place shines However due to service and poor quality on the non-sushi items my rating is two stars"}
{"text":"Most creative sushi I've eaten. The restaurant is non-descript and appears average, but the food is exceptional. I started with seaweed salad and a complimentary bowl of miso soup. Next I had the tuna stuffed, Japanese style jalapeño poppers presented with eel sauce. Delicious and unique. For an entree, the sashimi and crazy roll combo (a tuna, salmon, crab roll with cucumber wrap in place of nori) was, once again, one of a kind.

The people behind me had the omakase and it looked spectacular.

I was skeptical - sushi so far inland. But the reviews are accurate. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"Harumi sushi, oh me, oh my! Heart of downtown, and there it should be! Love the interior nice and small and well lit! Once you walk in you are definitely welcomed with such enthusiastic smiles and service. Sushi here is very active as when I say active sushi is always made so you definitely know your plate and rolls are going to be fresh indeed! You get a simple paper menu, and they also have to go sushi if you want to do grab and go which is something I can definitely get into. Our waitress and the workers were really interactive and so helpful! Guiding us Thru our menu and definitely the elder lady in the glasses helped us out with her cheerful personality. She pointed out he special which was better than the special roll we were gonna get which was the spicy combo roll or h3 maybe? But definitely get the \"omg\" roll cause it will let you be saying oh my gosh! Such a cool concept and delicious roll you'll just have to try it yourself! All their sushi roll is made with a healthy purple/black rice which is delicious and healthy for you I heard. Definitely don't mind, you pay for what you get and that's excellent sushi! Might be the best one in Phoenix so far! Well you'll certainly see my face there! If your in downtown ; it's a must stop by! Stay hungry Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi spot! 

Went to the diamondbacks game and none of the food sounded appetizing, so we decided to yelp restaurants in the surrounding area. After reading a few good reviews, we left the game early and headed to Harumi Sushi before they closed at 9.

Parking isn't the easiest to find, but that's downtown for you. We parked around the corner and started walking towards Harumi Sushi. I almost walked right past it, as it is a hidden little gem. 

We walked in, were greeted and sat right away. I picked edamame and stuffed jalapeños. The boyfriend picked salmon nigiri and the H3 roll. Shortly after we placed our order, they brought us blue fin nigiri courtesy of Chef Paul. Service moves pretty quickly as our food came out shortly after. Don't be alarmed, but the rice is purple! Purple rice is delicious. All the food exceeded my expectations and I will be coming back real soon."}
{"text":"They have good rolls and decent sushi.  Good price, but I expected better sushi based on the yelp reviews...

Great downtown location!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh if you don't know by now I am definitely a foodie! I love going to taste different types of food and this sushi restaurant it wasn't just good"}
{"text":"Not very good. Tried a couple different sample plates, rolls and sashimi and wasn't impressed. Purple rice was a nice esthetic and interesting but fish was just bland.

Pros: Food came out fast even though it was very busy. Convenient location if you're downtown.

Cons: Food was bland, nothing special. It's not a traditional sit down restaurant where you have a server, it's self serve after you stand in a long line. Tiny and cramped dining area (lots of people standing room only). Really small and crummy old bathroom.

We came here based on the great reviews but I think I went to a different restaurant, haha.

Probably won't try again."}
{"text":"Melt-in-your-mouth tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi is what I come here for. A smallish place thats good for casual dining/sakebombing parties with a large selection of sushi for take out. The owner Juno will leave you with your sides split and a smily warming your face. The waitstaff here are superb as well. Although they can be a bit pushy, you can tell that the owners' hearts are devoted to quality food."}
{"text":"If you're ever in downtown Phoenix and wanna try some pretty good sushi, come to Harumi Sushi!

This small place was told to us by our friends who have been going there for years! This place does not disappoint! 

The quality of the sushi is quite good and they're known for some of their differences compared to other sushi places. One thing is that in some of their sushi courses, they use purple rice, which is a rice infused with beans of some kind. It's absolutely delicious. Also, what's so special about Harumi too is that they make their own wasabi. It's definitely worth the $2 to get. 

Overall everything tastes great!!! The only things that might be a little hard on a customer is that it's a very small place, it won't seat that many people on a very busy day and it's quite expensive."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi! My favorite sushi spot in downtown. Not terribly expensive. Lots of special roll options, purple rice is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix, and not expensive! The service was phenomenal and the sushi was very good. Love how it's located in downtown Phoenix. Great little spot."}
{"text":"Harumi is exactly what sushi should be. 

It's fast, yet high quality. Doesn't matter much what color the rice is, it has great consistency that doesn't take away from the quality of their rolls. Their fish is great as well. Very nice tuna. I am still blown away by how it was ready within 10 minutes of ordering, or how during the day you can just grab some to-go. 

It is inexpensive. Rolls start at $7, and perhaps the best deal is the $15 mini roll combo that nets you 15 morsels that aren't significantly smaller than other dishes and can easily feed two people. All in a setting that's casual, but still very comfortable. 

If you're ready to sacrifice a bit of sushi bar showmanship of larger establishments, Harumi is *the* place to go for a tasty dinner."}
{"text":"Unassumingly sat in Downtown Phoenix, it isn't the fanciest place in town. But, it is fantastic! I have to admit that I'm not the biggest Sushi fan, but this is as good as it gets (better than I ever anticipated). Food is fantastic, at a great price point, and the staff-- well, they are out of this world! Our waitress went out of her way to recommend gluten free options for me and the chefs were all right on top of it, even stopping by my table to ensure I was Ok. You often hear the chef line calling out dishes as they go... \"Oh. my. God!!\" For the OMG role, \"thank you\" to all visitors leaving their establishment. What a treat of an experience while in Phoenix! I will definitely recommend to others!"}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the Phoenix area this place is fantastic.  I would highly recommend calling in for a reservation.  Keep in mind that they give you a 5 minute grace period, if your later than 5 minutes they will give up your table.  When you see how busy they are, you'll understand why they can't keep a table open.   

Pros:
Sushi is really good and tastes fresh.  Very impressive.  

They use forbidden rice which gave the sushi a distinct flavor, but not overpowering.  

We had the Rainbow roll, veggie roll, California roll, asparagus roll, tuna sashimi, tuna, salmon, scallop, yellowtail sushi orders - all of it was great!! 

Pricing is awesome: we ordered all the above and 2 large beers and 2 ice teas, 4 miso soups and an order of edamame and we paid $120 with the tip.  (Sushi order - We ordered two of each sushi listed above) 

Cons: 
Just one - service is a little awkward.  I wouldn't call it bad, just disorganized.  Check your bill before paying, we were charged for 2 rainbow rolls, when we ordered only one.  But that's because we had 3 different servers - I don't think that was by design. But if you can be patient with the disorganization, the food is completely worth it.  

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the service.  But the food itself is 5 star quality."}
{"text":"My first time having forbidden rice aka purple-looking rice. It definitely adds a unique touch to the sushi rolls. I still like my nigiri with white rice though. Fresh wasabi was added on top of the nigiri. If you want additional fresh wasabi, they will charge you an extra $2.00 for \"real wasabi\". I was so bummed out because the other sushi place that I usually frequent gives out fresh wasabi FREE all the time. My favorite item on the menu was the H3 roll. It was spicy, but not in any way a tear-jerker kind of spicy. I would also recommend getting the spicy sashimi salad, which was super good with strong flavors of sesame oil. 

Service was quick. We made a reservation, and were immediately seated upon arrival. The waitress forgot to bring out the miso soup we ordered until our meal was half done. By then, we had to cancel the soup from our order. 

This place is right in Downtown Phoenix. They do not have a private parking lot. There's a public parking lot behind the building that was $12.00 on a Monday! We settled for street parking at the meters right across from the Wells Fargo Museum instead - way cheaper. It's a four hour limit after 5pm versus a 1 hour limit before 5pm."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch when I was on a business trip to Phoenix. Food was tasty, portions were HUGE!! Prices very fair. The restaurant can get a bit crowded during lunch time, and that can cause some delay in getting your order, especially if you have a larger group (3 or more) and order a lot of food. I would definately recommend Harumi Sushi!"}
{"text":"There is no better place in Phoenix for sushi or service.  The rice adds a unique (good unique) flavor to the rolls,  and I haven't found fresher salmon or tuna yet.   Great flavors and great people,  we look forward to coming here, every time."}
{"text":"It's the best Japanese restaurant in Phoenix in terms of taste, quality, price, space, location and service. Never a bad meal here, you always come out of this restaurant feeling like an explosion of flavors just invaded your mouth. Make sure you try the seared salmon nagiri. I think it's their best one among the already really, really, really great fare."}
{"text":"As others have stated service here sucks, the food is good but the service seriously take s away from the experience tremendously. There are many other sushi bars in and near the area to have to settle for this place - and I work right next door."}
{"text":"This sushi place isn't up to par. The sushi pieces are so small, and there isn't a lot of variety on the menu (although there are a lot of choices, the ingredients are pretty repetitive). I ended up ordering the Three Set Mini Combo and got spider, shrimp tempura, and dynamite. The dynamite had waaaay too much sauce on it, and the tuna just fell apart when I was trying to pick it up. The shrimp tempura and the spider were okay. In general, the pieces were just too small though, and there was too much sauce on all the rolls."}
{"text":"Purple rice, fresh sashimi, delicious flavor, friendly staff, and really well priced lunch specials. What more is there to say?"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi place in Arizona.  We've tried our fair share of sushi and nothing compares to the freshness of the sashimi here and the liveliness of the atmosphere.  

Location: In DT Phoenix so there's plenty of entertainment close by.  

Price: Can't beat their prices.. quality sushi and fair.

{"text":"I just had the best sushi of my life! Have the unagi, oh my god, and the spider. So good!
Service very friendly and fast. Too fast. I prefer a slower pace and time between dishes. On the pricey side but so worth every penny."}
{"text":"100% amazing. 10/10 will get mind blown. Would recommend again."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in a long time! Incredibly nice staff and really quick service! I had the seaweed salad and Las Vegas roll and they knocked them out of the park.

Will absolutely be going back and highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"tl:dr
Good Sashimi, and seaweed salad, skip the Miso soup it sux.

Sashimi was good not the best I ever had but definitely edible and good value for money, I had Salmon, Albacore, and Yellowtail. Would buy again.
Seaweed salad, very good, would definitely buy again.
Miso soup was definitely the low light, probably the worst or close to the worst I have ever had."}
{"text":"This place is the best sushi I have had in Phoenix. It's amazing. I get the sashimi and oasis roll every time because I can't have rice. Back when I did eat rice I would have walked through fire for the omg roll. Okay maybe not but it really is one of my favorite things. The smokey flavors are amazing. I drive for Lyft on the weekends and tell everyone I drive to try harumi."}
{"text":"Busy place with very good food. A bit non-traditional, as they use black rice (not white \"sushi\" rice) in their rolls. Good sized servings, quite tasty."}
{"text":"Wife: \"I want some sushi.\" 
Me: \"What? You want fish in the middle of a dessert?\" 

We were in town for spring training. We were at the Westin Saturday evening. I didn't want to drive out so I did find this place on Yelp that had terrific reviews. Fine, let's get some fish in the dessert. 

I looked up the menu online and the prices were relatively cheap to California. Especially considering it's in downtown/financial district. 

There were only a few parties dining on a Saturday evening. I was hoping it wasn't a bad sign. We were greeted right away and got seated. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. 

We ordered a couple of rolls and chirashi. WOW! We were surprised on the quality and the detail the chef (Juno) put into his work. If you know sushi, you know that there are crappy sushi, from cheap Japanese restaurants/buffets, and good sushi/rolls that you get from a $$$$ spot. This was definitely a $$$$ spot at a $$ price. They used black rice, which comes out purple, that are more costly than white rice. Rice was cooked and prepared perfectly. The fish were fresh. They even had REAL WASABI in their chirashi! Everything was prepared flawlessly! I ended up getting another chirashi. 

So to all you locals in Phoenix: You guys are very fortunate to have a restaurant with such a good chef. It's really unfortunate that even though California has so many Japanese places, 99% of them are crap. 

(I have NO idea why there's a reviewer that gave you 2 stars even though she said the sushi was \"great.\" It's no fault of the chef that there was a big order before yours. Good sushi takes time to prepare."}
{"text":"This place deserves 6 or 7 stars...it's friendly from the second you walk in, speedy from te second you sit down, and tasty from the second you are served...the yellowtail was the absolute best, blue fin tuna was spot on, and excellent all the way til the last piece of purple rice...the sushi chef and waiter snuck us some mochi and a special salmon fish dish that was amazing...if you're still reading wondering if anything was bad, there wasn't anything to say other than new favorite sushi spot in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have ever had. Loved the black rice. All the rolls we had were super fresh and delicious! The Harumi roll is amazing! The head chef came to our table, joked with us and gave us some free rolls! Definitely recommend coming here! Wishing there was a black rice sushi place in CA!"}
{"text":"Awesome Chirashi bowl. Great, attentive service. Purple rice is off putting at first but delicious."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. Sushi is creamy, crunchy, and delicious. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi.  Seemed extremely fresh and the price was excellent.  A casual kind of local type atmosphere. 
I was disappointed that there was no sushi bar and wasn't crazy about the way they had the tables set up (a two seater table right next to a 4 top booth...kind of awkward). 
It's pretty basic sushi although they had a couple of selections with mango and they use that yummy purple rice with some of their rolls. 
I would definitely go again and recommend to even the most extreme sushi snobs,,,you know who you are :)"}
{"text":"My sister came to town and we decided to check out this little restaurant! It's the real deal in downtown Phoenix! Sushi Chef is from Osaka! His name is Juno! He not only serves everything fresh, but in a beautiful artistic way! We had ramen, sashimi and sushi rolls! Very generous portions and yummmmmo! Service is excellent! We highly recommend this place! It reminded my husband and I of the kind of restaurants we went to in Japan! Arigato!"}
{"text":"I'm giving harumi sushi four stars although it is definitely one of my top favorite sushi spots in AZ. The sushi is very good. Rolls are big and filling! Very very cheap pricing!! I will always go to Harumi if I'm looking to eat a lot of sushi! Their seaweed salad is also to die for! Very good! Miso soup is like $1.50 and very good! So I would give the pricing and sizing 5 stars. The inside is not as up to date but for being a little sushi spot in downtown phx it'll do. If you are looking for more of a hole in the wall type of spot to eat at this would be the one. In the heart of downtown and a little hard to find is what makes it a little more fun and unique. Also this is one of few sushi spots that serves the forbidden purple rice! I imagine this is what attracts the most people. The purple rice is their fun little spin on things. Over all love harumi, have been maybe ten times and am looking forward to always coming back to this unique spot! Oh also! The staff is always very very sweet. They never fail to say goodbye and thank you for coming in when you leave. And I mean each and every one of them will say goodbye! It's the sweetest!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place waiting to see a show. Man, I am so glad we did! The sushi is amazing! The chef is adorable! The staff is so friendly. You feel like a small town family feel as soon as you walk in! We got a caterpillar roll- which he put a caterpillar smile on (Aww!!), California roll (love the black rice) vegetable tempura, and some ramen noodles topped off with some saki bombers. What a great place! I can't wait to go back with friends and share this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fabulous! The sushi is great, and priced... within reason. The food is fresh, tasty, and traditional. Would recommend! 
They also do teriyaki and bento boxes for lunch and dinner. It's (good) Asian to go!"}
{"text":"Got take out from harumi a few nights ago, and it was DELICIOUS! The finding Nemo roll (as cruel as that sounds) was really well prepared with purple rice tightly wrapped around similar to California roll filling. On top of the roll was chopped up spicy salmon, something green and crunchy (maybe jalapenos)? The flavors go really well together and I can't wait to go back to try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"I tried the spicy chicken with fried rice and was not impressed at all. They lunch menu was extremely limited. Won't be eating there again"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Service was GREAT! Waitresses are amazing here! They bring out the sushi on fire!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty cool place in Phoenix. The prices are about on par with most other sushi places I've been to and the food was pretty good. The \"oh my god\" roll, in particular, was delicious and lived up to it's name, flavor wise. You also get a little presentation upon the delivery of said roll.
Also, they make their sushi with black (aka purple) rice, which is pretty cool. This is definitely a place worth checking out if you're in Downtown Phoenix and want sushi or a good meal."}
{"text":"Sushi is great, first time we came because it is a little farther than other places we normally go to"}
{"text":"This was our first dining experience in downtown Phoenix, and what an awesome meal.  Small, quaint space, with very friendly and attentive staff.  Even the owner walks around and makes you feel welcome.  A great variety of rolls, apps and more.  Best sushi in Phoenix.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went to this sushi for the first time . Great ambience and vibe ...reminded me of big city sushi casual joint . If your into fresh nigiri this should be your spot . Very fresh sushi and sashimi"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times so far, and all 3 times have been absolutely delicious... and best sushi I have had in Phoenix by far. 

If you check-in, you get free Edamame and Miso Soup, which isn't too shabby. The edamame is very warm when it comes out, but they may add a wee bit too much extra salt on them for seasoning. Miso soup is standard. 

The beauty of this place is in their unique and elaborately designed rolls. My favorite is easily the Oasis roll, which has a refreshing vinegar-cucumber wrap (opposed to the typical seaweed wrap) around more refreshing crab and salady-goodness. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water and want to go back again soon. 

Their traditional rolls are even special because of its use of purple rice. The rice is soft and delicious and just fascinating to eat. H3 rolls, Las Vegas Roll, Dynamite Rolls... some mango roll... all so flavorful. 

The salmon nigiri..is just. so. good, too... I don't know how they make it seem like it's fresh because Phoenix definitely isn't close to any waters.... But the presentation is so clean and the amount of ginger used to speckle the top is perfection.

The waitress is also awesome. She is so hyped up with energy somehow and pleasantly nice. Very good demeanor even when it's busy and she is scurrying around everywhere. 

The only odd part is the bathrooms are out the back door... and through more back doors. 

I saved this place to be my 100th Yelp review. :)"}
{"text":"I die! I've been searching for a great sushi place in Phoenix and this place delivers. We ordered H3 roll, the seared tuna, Oh My God Roll and the experience was Oh My God! We actually ordered 6-7 rolls but the server was nice to tell us it's a lot for 2 so she eliminated 3 for us and picked the one she liked the most from our list. I'm glad she did because we were in a sushi coma after our meal. It was the kind of dinner I wake up thinking about. Hope I have a chance to come back soon."}
{"text":"This place was highly rated so I gave it a try while in town. One roll I had was decent. For the other they did make a Chef's Special yellowtail roll for me just because I asked if they had a yellowtail roll and they didn't, that one was pretty delicious. 

The wait time was a little too long, both on the ordering end and on waiting for the check. For some reason they were unable to just bring the check to me and kept serving new people who kept walking in the door, so eventually I had to just get up and go wait in the takeout line to pay (even though they'd told me to sit back down and wait), I guess they were just dust."}
{"text":"Never ever anywhere else for the best sushi! Keep it local folks great meal, great prices and staff knowledgeable and helpful"}
{"text":"We loved this place...  great food number 1, great atmosphere & fair prices....  we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Friendly staff.  The building wraps around so the front door is actually on Central.   

We had the dynamite roll and oh my god roll which the waiter sets on fire.  Both were delicious. 

The restaurant is small and very basic with tables and chairs.  

Next time you are downtown you should stop in."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and lots of it!!! The purple rice is yummy and adds a nice hint of color! The rolls are huge so make sure you order wisely haha. The staff was super friendly and attentive! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Few sushi rolls are more aptly named than the 'Oh My God' roll...I found that I just could not stop repeating 'Oh my god...' as they were bringing out the dish (super impressed by the way with how the server handled the dish that was housed in an aluminum foil cover engulfed in flames!), and seemingly with every bite...I've had A LOT of sushi in my life all over...S. Cali, NYC, Boston...and this place is easily near the tippy top of the list of best sushi I've ever had...the H3 roll was fantastic, love the spicy kick at the end. The Ahi Tower (kind of a deconstructed roll) is hands down one of my favorite dishes ever at a restaurant!!  We also had the spicy tuna roll, which is one of our favorites to begin with, but it was even better with black rice. My wife and I then proceeded to eat every single piece of food that came with the Omakase for two dish, and everything was not only extremely tasty but just SO SO fresh!! The generous chef then topped it all off with a complimentary \"sushi dessert,\" which was 6 pieces of what looked like little mini tuna steaks just perfectly adorned with some wasabi flavoring...can't say enough good things about this place. I actually did not think there were any sushi places in AZ worth going to, but we made the 45 min drive from the West Valley just to try this place and it was well worth it. Do not miss out on this Phoenix gem, if you're a sushi fan, this place is a MUST try...thank you Harumi, we will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I give it a solid \"Meh.\" 

Not bad, but not really the best either. 

I found the purple rice interesting but unnecessary and just strange to look at. The tables were cramped and I felt like I could be touching elbows with the table next to us. 

Service was good though."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  So glad I tried this. The lunch prices are unbelievable and the quality is high.  I couldn't finish my lunch, they give very big portions. My favorite was the stuffed jalepeno, it would be just enough for a light lunch. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I heard this place was great and the sushi was VERY fresh so I had to check it out with my sushi loving gf. The soda machine was out when I visited so that was a bummer but I gotta say the food came out SUPER FAST, the service was exceptional as well and the sushi was nicely presented, fresh, and very delicious! I love the black rice which is known for it's super antioxidant properties. For anyone that concerns please note the color will throw you off more than the taste, it tastes just like white or brown rice. I noticed they work very much as a team and help each other out which was wonderful because we did not have dirty plates sitting on our table for long (huge pet peeve of mine) and something I notice since for many years I worked in the restaurant industry. I'd totally go back and am still daydreaming a little about some of the rolls I had."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing the people that work here are super nice very clean and they always welcome you with a smile... Nice cool place to hang out and have some great sushi... Definitely coming back!! Oh yeah the yellow tail sashimi is the best sashimi I ever had and the prices are reasonable... If your in downtown Phoenix this place is a must try  you won't regret it....."}
{"text":"At first, I thought it would be a regular restaurant, but it turned out to be quite different from what I expected. 

First, you have a display where you can pick out any sushi rolls you want, or choose from a list to have them make it fresh. (I recommend you order from the rolls on the list). We ordered the Ahi Tower (included is a picture of our half-eaten Ahi Tower). It was savory and spicy and delicious, possibly one of the best I've had. I was pleasantly surprised that they used black rice instead of white rice, since I've heard black rice is much healthier. 

Then, there is a section that kinda reminds me of Subway - you get to pick what goes in your bento box. I had a spicy chicken bento (only $7) with fried rice, vegetables, tofu, salad, tempura, and something I'm not sure how to describe - similar to a Korean side dish. 

It's a very casual and small little place, and really good for working people who need to grab something to go. 

The lemonade I got from the soda machine had a bad aftertaste, but I dumped it out and got the unsweetened tea instead, which tasted much better. 


Also, I recommend you check-in to receive the free edamame and miso soup :)"}
{"text":"Fresh tasting, colorful rolls. Love the purple rice. Prices are very reasonable for the quality. The main sushi chef is super friendly and offered us two fish samples (seared salmon and a fatty tuna, YUM) and a mochi green tea ice cream sample at the end of the meal. We are new to Phoenix and this will definitely be our go to sushi place."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've ever had. One of my favorite things is the purple rice! How cute! If you catch it in time the grab-n-go bar is discounted after 2pm, but it usually sells out pretty fast. The portions are very nice and the people are even nicer. There is a man who works there, I'm not sure if he owns it or is head chef or something, but he is very nice and attentive. I will be going back here, very often!"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi in the valley. Very affordable compared to our N Scottsdale sushi bars - they can't touch this place for cost and quality. Seriously a meal for two that would have run $110 was $75 here (and we were quite full after a couple of rolls and lots of sashimi-my fav!).  Loved every bite, although the OMG roll is best split between 4+ (there are so many flavors and the char from being ignited is a little much after 2-3 pcs)."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY friendly staff and prompt service. I tend to over order when I'm hungry (which I was when I walked in!) and the waitress talked me down to a more reasonable order! (Never go to the grocery store when you haven't eaten all day!!) I'm glad she did! Good sushi too! I will be back!"}
{"text":"BY FAR THE BEST SUSHI IN THE PHOENIX AREA! The staff was beyond friendly and the service was great. Moving from LA and knowing good sushi, Harumi Sushi was good or better than any place in LA. Juno the owner does a phenomenal job preparing the sexy sushi. This for sure is my new favorite sushi bar."}
{"text":"The ahi tuna appetizer and the udon soup was fairly good. The rest of the sushi we ordered was subpar. Too much fillers in the sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in phoenix. Smaller spot but the wait isn't usually too long. First timers must get the \"oh my god\" roll. Not only for the taste but the experience. The only negative thing I can say is the bathroom is like something out of a horror film. So pee before you leave the house or hold it till the next bar."}
{"text":"Wow! Damn this place is good. Not a really appealing place from the front, but as you walk in you are welcomed by a shout out from the Sushi Chefs. Love it, just wished I knew what the hell they were saying. The decor and ambiance isn't the most intimate, but you really don't come here for that. This is the breakdown of the sea carnage that went down at our table of 2. 

Toro - Not always available, we jumped at the opportunity to indulge in the belly of beast! Melts in your mouth delicious!!!

Shrimp Tempura - Tempura is always touchy for me. The batter is everything and a lot of times its too thick. Harumi's tempura was perfect! Almost as good as my favorite place in Maui (Sansei). 

Stuffed Jalapenos - You did what with that pepper? You stuffed it with crab and tempura'd that garnish from south of the border? Yeah, and it works. 

Ramen - Hey, you can't pass up an chance to have Ramen that isn't out of a bag! We really didn't expect the kick that this ramen had, but luckily for me it was so spicy that it was all mine to slurp and gulp!! No dry seasoning packets used in this bowl. Awesomeness.

Service is fast and friendly! Thanks for a great night Harumi. Will definitely be back to try so many other items."}
{"text":"The sushi is fresh and flavorful! We are very picky about sushi and found this place through Yelp. Didn't know what to expect of sushi in Phoenix. The service was good. The main sushi chef has a great personality- he got the whole place to sing Happy Birthday to a fellow diner, gave samples to try to the different tables which was warmly received. We loved the green tea mochi he offered us. All of this made the environment feel welcoming. Like we've always come here. We ordered the seaweed salad, Finding Nemo roll and Caterpiller roll and had Chardonnay. Everything was wonderful. Over-the-top amazing was the Finding Nemo roll - get it and see why. Soooo good. We were here for Comicon but if we are ever here again - we will be back!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! Never thought I would get the chance to try Toro in my life, but today I had 2 different kinds and it was phenomenal!!! Service is always fast. The chef is amazing and full of positive energy. He mingles through the dining area and even lead back to back bday songs. Most importantly, try the fresh wasabi...it is out of this world good!!!"}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing time at Harumi. Get the omacasa and let the sushi chefs create for you-divine! Sexy Juno is the best-our fave sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place at all, I would love to give it 3.5 stars but I can't. I went on a Wednesday night and this place was packed, so naturally I was very excited. I ordered the salmon sushi and a mini combo roll (rainbow, Las Vegas, and I believe the Oasis). The fish quality wasn't that bad, but the rice was a bit sweet (and purple). I don't really like sweet things in general and the rice took away some of the flavor of the fish, which was disappointing to me. The construction of the rolls was clever and tasty so good job to the designers. Realistically, if you want some good sushi in the area then stop by this place, but I don't think I'll be back on account of the sweet rice. Lastly, the prices here are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I love it here! Best sushi in town by far. The service is friendly and very quick. There are a lot of fun rolls to try but they do the simple rolls on point too...sometimes you just want a really great California roll :)"}
{"text":"We are the sex and the city roll, the omg roll and the jelepano poppers and a simple California roll. And between me and my friend we ate all of it. We decided it was a top sushi place from all the ones we've tried. We even got it to go and it still tasted like it was so fresh!"}
{"text":"+Love how the rolls are made with black rice.

+Wish there was more fresh raw fish options and not so much fake Krab"}
{"text":"This place is always a pleaser. The purple rice was shocking at first but quickly changed my mind when I tried a roll. Usually the owner waves at you while he's making delicious rolls, and says bye and thanks you for leaving as you walk out. The rainbow roll is a favorite, as well as the Arizona roll. Highly recommend this place, I will be returning as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"I travel large cities throughout the US and can confidently say this is the best sushi restaurant I have been to. Love the hole in the wall atmosphere and the direct and bold waitress. Sushi is the best you may ever have."}
{"text":"Favorite place for sushi in phx. The owner and staff are awesome. Super friendly and funny. They use purple rice with their fish which is a nice change. Cool part of downtown phx. Never have to wait for a table. If you bring a cute girl with you, you'll end up with free sushi from the boss. Great guy."}
{"text":"Very solid, if nontraditional, sushi. Lots of sauces on the rolls I had but didn't mean they weren't delicious. I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Harumi was a pleasant surprise! 4/5 stars for sure. 

With a friend in town, we decided to eat sushi on a Friday night and headed downtown in search of a place. It appears to be a little swanky hole in the wall type of place that feels welcoming, authentic and casual when you walk in. The staff was attentive, courteous and patient. We ordered the Harumi Roll, the Oh My God, Scallop roll, and Las Vegas Roll with edamame as an appetizer. The server asked us if we were really hungry, because each roll came with 10 pieces = AWESOME info! The purple rice with the rolls, fresh ingredients, and 9/10 presentation from the cooks, staff and Mochi Mango ice cream makes this place an instant favorite for sushi from here on out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Phoenix! My first experience there was sort of funny. I came when they ran out of food, thus I couldn't be served. I decided I didn't mind getting so to-go sushi they had already prepared, and they gave me, initally, a discount of 30%. Then, they decided to just give it to me for free. I loved the sushi and was overjoyed the whole night. I wouldn't have mind paying for it.

The other day was my first time being served, and I loved it so much. The server was nice and friendly. I ordered the OMG roll and Phily Roll and I'm still thinking about it. It was the best sushi I have everrrr eaten in my whole life. There is a reason why the OMG roll is called that. You will literally say OMG repeatedly. My boyfriend ordered the Las Vegas roll, jalapeno poppers, and ramen. His food was so good I ended up eating all of his food :P 

I really enjoyed this place and I will come back soon."}
{"text":"Holy moly this place is amazing!!! A little hole in the wall joint with plenty of personality is just what I needed in Phoenix. I highly recommend the Ahi Tower if you're not in the mood for a sushi roll. We will definitely be coming back for more"}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for a couple years and I consider this one of the best sushi restaurants in Phoenix. If not THE BEST. 

Every roll here is beyond delicious. Tonight I had the Oh My God roll and the Harumi Roll. Both were incredible. The lady even let me heat up the Oh My God roll myself!! Great setup and ambiance.

THE HIGHLIGHT of the meal for me was definitely the Tuna Nigiri! I have to get it every time I'm here!  Plus the wasabi is fresh and spicyyyy (not in a bad way). You can't go wrong with anything you order here, it's all good!"}
{"text":"Oops, I forgot to review this! How could I forget to review such a memorable meal.

I think that the waiter we had (Chef Juno) made the experience even more exceptional. His quips and antics made the meal even more enjoyable. 

The reason you go to Harumi Sushi is for the quality of the food, the variety of dishes, and the great taste. You will not be disappointed at all.

We were lucky to have made a reservation as the place was packed. It is always a good idea to make reservations for dinner anywhere in the Phoenix metropolitan area on a Friday or Saturday night.

You can definitely eat sushi cheaper elsewhere, but you will probably not enjoy the dining experience as much. 

This is definitely a restaurant that I will return to for more great sushi."}
{"text":"Went for week day lunch. Great, fresh sushi.!friendly staff. I had the oasis roll and it was delicious"}
{"text":"When I arrived for lunch I did not know that it was buffet style and I almost left but I'm glad I didn't, the rolls I got were pretty good,  Harumi roll, H3 roll.

I think the sushi is good for the price and if you're in a hurry this is a good sushi place to go. I would not say it was one of the top sushi places in Arizona however.

I would call it fresh fast food sushi. If there was a way to do 3.5 stars I would do that.

The staff is extremely friendly, which is nice."}
{"text":"Food was good.  You order then sit.  I was a little put off that they charged me $0.20 for the gluten free soy sauce.  I almost walked away. The Oasis roll was excellent."}
{"text":"I would consider myself a connoisseur of sushi. And I have to say this place is on the up-and-up. The wait staff is prompt and friendly and attentive. And the sushi is a great balance of flavors in both the rolls and the high quality fish for the sashimi.  Excellent all the way around!"}
{"text":"The first time we came to Harumi, I passed the tables and saw something with tin foil on it. When the waitress came to take our order, I pointed to the tin foil. She nodded and smiled widely, and I was excited to see what the big fuss was about.
Our waitress came back, and the tin foil was on fire. Yeah, fire. Wait, one more time in case that didn't come across, fire.
She moved the tin foil around, playing with the fire, and after a few seconds was able to open it.
I popped one of the sushi pieces into my mouth (is it still sushi if it's cooked?), and went \"Oh my God.....\"
Hence the name, O.M.G. sushi. Can I describe how the outer flavored meshed together with the inner spices? Crab, eel, and shrimp, all my favorite things in one roll. 
That was my experience my first time at Harumi, and I have come back repeatedly since. Part of me hates reviewing this place because we come here so often and I don't want anyone else to come here because it's already a popular place, but Harumi deserves so much praise. It's one of our favorite date night spots because the service and food is amazing.  The staff is so friendly and sweet, and when we order sashimi we always receive huge chunks of fresh fish. The sushi is wrapped in purple rice, also known as Emperor's rice, because it used to be forbidden to all except royalty since the rice is super healthy, and that's just what they use for their regular rolls! If that were not enough, you can also order a Mini Roll Combo, where you can choose up to three different kinds of sushi to try! It's a great way to sample a few, and trust me they are all delicious, including the Phoenix, the Dragon, and the Las Vegas Roll. 
So at the risk of blowing up an already blown up date spot, go to Harumi, I'll probably already be there stuffing my face with their delicious sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi was delicious and very well plated. The black rice aka purple rice is such a cool and fun way to set their sushi apart from other sushi places. The black rice has health benefits and the restaurant has posters with these benefits in their restaurant! Our waiter was nice and kept up with our refills."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi.  Purple rice, great service.  This place is totally the place to come for amazing amazing sushi"}
{"text":"We tried to call and make a reservation but they said they don't do reservations so when we went in and asked to sit at a booth they said it was reserved. I don't know what that was about.
Service was great and fast. Best sushi I've had in Arizona. I'd recommend the OMG Roll."}
{"text":"The purple rice was a nice surprise on the Arizona roll that my son ordered. Kind of an unassuming decor and you might just pass by and not even notice it but the food was delish! Worth stopping in for lunch"}
{"text":"This place is honestly the best place I've been to. The service, quality of food prepared, the entertainment of the sushi chef are top notch. We had the best time last night at this place. Unfortunately we are not from here, if so we would be here very often. You will not regret going here."}
{"text":"We were really hungry and we were looking for some good Asian food in Downton phoenix. We came across Harumi Sushi and it was really good. The waitress ladies were really friendly and came to check on us many times making sure we are happy and got everything we needed. They recommended OMG roll and H roll. OMG roll comes in the foil and the fire show! It was really cool. Both rolls were really awesome! I definitely recommend this place when you are craving Asian Food when you are in Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Sushi is great! Flavorful and nice variety of different rolls and sushi. The Blue Fin Tuna Poke was our favorite. Service is fast for the most part. When it's hot outside the waiting area inside is very small. No sign saying \"wait to be seated\" or to grab a number when theres a wait. No one greets you or let's you know that you need a number...that part seems a little disorganized. But everything else is great."}
{"text":"I was drawn in by the reviews. Unfortunately, I wont be coming back. The service was poor. I had to waive down the waitress to order my food and also to get my check. My food took a while and it was not what i expected. The miso soup had an interesting after taste and the location uses purple rice to make sushi. This was my first time trying and I was not impressed. The highlight of the night was watching the sushi chef/floor manager yell at a waitress in front of GUEST . She was  handling  some  aluminum foil that was on fire. I believe this is a dish, I am not sure if SHE was doing the procedure wrong but he was just yelling at her. REGARDLESS  that should not be Something  the guest have to see.Besides not having good food they have to Invest  in some customer service Courses."}
{"text":"love the black/purple rice, so hard to find in Phoenix (and especially since Harumi doesn't charge you $3 extra for it).  Also fun/friendly staff!"}
{"text":"OK... I don't even know where to begin!  My wife and I came downtown to look around and saw this beautiful little restaurant so we decided to give it a try.  The menu has a lot to offer and the young gal who was our server was spot on, quick and attentive to us and everyone around us.  OK enough about that... on to the food, wow!  My wife and I ate the same (boring huh) dish and each had the Nigiri with spicy tuna rolls (9 piece) and to say it was great would be an understatement.  To be honest my wife and I both said this is the BEST sushi either one of us have ever had and this is saying a lot because we lived in Hawaii for a long time.  It's cool how they do it.. (spoiler alert) the rice is dyed a natural almost purpleish blue and it just works.

Texture, taste and freshness were unbeatable, I'd give it try if I were you.  We'll be back and often too."}
{"text":"First off, I lived in Vancouver, Canada for a long time before moving to the US 3yrs ago and therefore am quite picky about my sushi. Second, I moved to Spokane, WA, which is an amazing small, big city but one thing it's lacking is a good variety of Asian restaurants. Therefore, whenever I travel for work, I always look up the Asian restaurant offerings and get my fill. 
 
Much to my dismay, downtown Phoenix did not have a lot of Asian restaurants either. Upon finding Harumi on Yelp and getting good reviews, and since there really wasn't a lot of choices, I gave it a try. 

I went there with two other colleagues, who both lived in LA area, and we did it family style. We ordered some nigiri, sashimi, a couple of hand rolls, and three rolls. They didn't have any special fish that day (Tuesday), as they get their shipment on Wednesdays. Everything we ordered was delicious. The rice is purple, as most have commented, but the texture and chew is not any different than normal sushi rice. The nigiri and sashimi all smelled and tasted fresh, with very generous pieces. 

I was so impressed that I did return there the next day, especially since I was really craving some toro. Ordered slightly different items on my second visit and they were all just as good. Harumi only offers sushi and some appy items (tempura, edamame, etc). So if you are more of the teriyaki camp, as opposed to sushi, you won't have any choices here. 

Not only is the food great, the service is also amazing. The servers were all very friendly and you get the feeling they all like working there. On the first night, my colleagues and I received a free, extra item from the kitchen. It was a courtesy item (some call it a \"service\") that's not on the menu (probably something they do for the omakaze) and it was so good! On my second night, one of the servers accidentally told me that an 8pc toro sashimi was $16. It turns out that it was really $30 and they honored the $16 price! PLUS the kitchen gave me a free, extra spicy scallop hand roll (again, probably part of their omakaze offering). 

If you are craving very good sushi with great service, that is not pretentious, that is pretty casual and chill, you have to try Harumi. If I visit Phoenix again, I will definitely go back, again and again and again."}
{"text":"The sushi here is very good, especially the OMG roll . Staff is friendly and very attentive. My husband and I brought our friends here and they also loved it."}
{"text":"Omg I can't believe how much I ate here and how good it was. I just kept shoving it in my mouth never taking the time to think what my stomach had to say. It was so delicious I couldn't stop eating. Been one of the last costumers left in side the owner just kept feeding us more and more free stuff. The black Rice is so makes everything taste so much better and the purple color adds a awesome new look to the food"}
{"text":"Great sushi, great appetizers (try their jalapeños stuffed with amazing something!!!), and absolutely wonderful specials / sashimi. The owner came to our table to check on us several times, and talked to us about Japan. We have been to Japan, and still think this place is the best in the entire Southwest! (We are from Colorado)."}
{"text":"The food was good. But the service was surprisingly terrible, given what others say. It took OVER 30 minutes to bring us the lunch specials, so long we had to basically eat and run to get back to work on time (we walked from an office 15 min away), didn't get to really enjoy the food. 

No explanation for the delay was given, until I was preparing to stop a waitress at the counter and ask if we had been forgotten. Then she said \"Oh, we're short a chef today\" (although I counted six people working on the line in the kitchen, and others' food came out before ours did). Well, if that's true, you should be up front with irritated customers wondering if they have been forgotten. Next, the check didn't appear until we asked, again just before I was going to approach the counter and ask for it again. Finally, the water was never refilled... I would have asked, but never got a chance, as the waitress never came back to the table during the meal. 

Too bad, I had been looking forward to trying it for a long time. But I won't be back, I don't have a long enough lunch hour to deal with unpredictable and forgetful service."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi. Quaint little restaurant. Excellent service. You must get there early because it gets crowded fast. A definite top number one recommendation for sushi while in Phoenix downtown area. It will definitely be my go-to place when I come to town."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sushi downtown PHOENIX! The black rice is so nutritious and the presentation for OMG Roll is phenomenal! The Las Vegas roll is one of the best I've had and they are efficient with your time. I usually come here for my 30 min lunch and I am in and out within 22-25 min! It's awesome food that I recommend you try! If you like sushi you will now be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I reviewed Harumi Sushi on 10/30/13 and said, \"...but when the word gets out how good they really are...this place will have a line out the door.\"  It's still great food, and while I haven't quite seen a line out the door, it's rare to see an empty table at dinner time.  If you haven't tried this place, you haven't had real sushi."}
{"text":"For date night, we decided to try Harumi before the ballet in downtown. We were seated right in front of the sushi bar and right in front of the owner Juno, who quickly became our new best friend. We ordered sake, the Omakase (Chef's Choice), blue fin plate and Cali roll. The chef's choice had salmon nigiri, spicy salmon wrapped in pretty thin slices of avocado, toro, squid, octopus salad, it was all wonderful and beautiful!! Juno handed us a yellowtail sample that was light and citrusy that was on the house because he said I was too pretty. I shall take all the compliments and yummy sushi I can get! The blue fin plate even had little flecks of gold. Our server was very helpful and had nice recommendations which we appreciated as this was our first time aft the restaurant. 

Juno checked on us a few times and was kind, asking us what we were up to this weekend. He's playful with his staff and greets and thanks all the customers that walk in. He was at the right level of in your face customer service. 

Great date night, we highly recommend this place. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"What a great find. I got lucky to stumble upon this place when I went to see a show at the Comeria theater.
The sushi is VERY fresh.
It's reasonably priced for sushi.
I really liked the Oasis roll (I think that's what it was called). It's rice-less and wrapped with cucumber.
We got the Omakase for 2. Though it was all very tasy, I was disappointed that two of the three rolls had spicy tuna on it. I wish there was more diversity on the Omakase platter.
I'll be back to this place again real soon."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in a long long time. Nigiri and sashimi were on point, especially the salmon. Very fresh, very delicious. I will definitely be back here early and often. 
Staff was also very attentive and fun. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Seriously the best sushi place in Arizona . The fish is out of this world and the rice is so unique and delicious . If you don't give this place a try you are seriously missing out. And the most reasonable pricing ever. I actually feel like I'm underpaying"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here after reading reviews on yelp, and we're glad we did. Since I'm a NY native, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sushi, which were consistent with what I was used to.

We both had the omakase ($35/person). A lot of pieces for the price. The owner even came to greet us and gave us an extra dish and there was complimentary mochi ice cream afterwards.

The restaurant has many 2-4 people tables; so it's not exactly a place to go to with a large party but it can with a reservation.

I would definitely go eat at Harumi again. The place is clean; it doesn't have much of a cool-looking decor, nothing fancy, but the food and service are quite good."}
{"text":"Tasty stuff. Nice people. The Ahi Tower was great.

I was in town for 2 nights and almost went back again the second night.

Aesthetics could use some work."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi!! I came here with a group and was able to try the Chirashi, sashimi appetizer and the oasis roll + 6 piece sashimi combo. Everything was decently priced, and I was surprised that the roll combo with sashimi came out to only $16, when normally that much sashimi alone is that price. They were also thick slices of fish and came with some fresh wasabi on top. The Chirashi came with their famous black rice and it was yummy and sort of tasted like brown rice to me. Supposedly it's better for you and is filled with loads of antioxidants! For those less adventurous, sorry but they actually don't serve white rice at all! The Chirashi also came with the larger fish eggs which I thought were way too salty and ended up removing them. Overall, their servings were large, decently priced and delicious. Only downside is the parking and you'll have to park at a meter, but that's Phoenix for you!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the rolls came out super fast, however we weren't big fans of all the sauces that they drown them in. The purple rice was very pretty but it was way too filling. If I ever returned I'd try the sashimi instead of the saucy rolls."}
{"text":"Harumi sushi is the best! The staff is always so friendly and the food is amazing - the sushi rice is purple! Oh My God Roll is my favorite!  I have never been disappointed! The owner is so nice and is always having us try something new. We never go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while. The purple rice is very unique but added a great flavor to the sushi rolls. Service was great everyone was very nice. Can't wait to go back to try more."}
{"text":"The sushi was very fresh and delicious We got the stuffed jalapenos and the sexy crab to start the OMG And H3 roll both were amazing"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy on outside or inside but food is AMAZING. Not to mention, the purple rice is so interesting! Staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"This place is the best sushi I have ever had. In addition it is a cute little restaurant that is clearly run by the owners. There was a semi long wait which can be expected but once seated our order was taken promptly and the sushi came out extremely fast. It is so reasonably priced for how amazing it is and how large the rolls are. The freshest tuna and salmon sashimi I have ever seen and tasted. After we ate the head sushi chef and owner stopped by the table to check on the food. Just fantastic from top to bottom."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place with some classmates and the sushi here is amazing. The sushi chef even stopped by our table to see if everything was going well. I would highly recommend this sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"The black rice was amazing!!! Super fast service!! Food was excellent!! The staff there is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, oasis and crazy rolls are great... and huge. Service is great and fast. I will be back next time I'm in Phoenix"}
{"text":"This is currently my favorite sushi place ever! I have been here a few times since I live out of town, but I make an effort to eat here every time I'm in the area! 

OMG roll:
My absolute favorite. This arrives to your table wrapped in tinfoil and set on fire. The waiter or waitress unwraps the tinfoil, setting the fire out. The small fire adds a hint of a smokiness, like a light barbecue. I love this roll, and I think it's a steal at $13! This type of specialty roll would usually be pricier at other places. One roll is enough to fill me up!

H3 roll:
This is also a delicious roll and priced the same as the OMG roll ($13). This was definitely spicier than the OMG roll, so if you're looking for something spicy, this is your roll. While this roll was also good, I prefer the OMG roll because of that delicious smoky flavor.

Service:
We have always had friendly, attentive waiters. During one visit, Juno treated us to some complimentary green tea mochi ice cream! Last time, we got free miso soup & edamame (from the check-in offer), two free pieces of eel, and free ice cream!"}
{"text":"First time here. Loved the atmosphere and the workers were really nice. The food was delicious. One of the best places to eat sushi in Arizona. Ordered the omakase, spicy ahi salad, forgot what it was called but it's a tempura sushi roll cut into 6 pieces, h3 roll, and few more rolls. All were really tasty. Good for kids to."}
{"text":"What a GEM! Sushi can be very hit or miss in Phoenix and Harumi Sushi wins for food, ambiance and amazing service with a smile! Not super trendy or fancy, but a great spot for a casual date. Upon entering, you're greeted with a big KONICHIWA from the owner and staff who bend over backwards to make sure every guest feels welcomed and has a positive experience. The signature forbidden rice is a fun twist on old classic. The sushi is absolutely delicious and the portions are huge! We always end up with more than we need because it's just too good to stop order. The H3 roll and Sushi Combo appetizers are favorites of ours. Give this downtown Phoenix spot a chance, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay. So This place has been on my \"try it' list for a little while now.... and today I was downtown and trying to figure out what I wanted to do.... so I decided today was the day. I checked in on yelp and got a bowl of good miso soup ($1.50) and a big cup of edamane ($3). So by checking in on here you get almost $5 of free food. I decided on the 5 piece sushi and I think it is the crazy roll. As you probably can tell from pictures and other reviews, they use purple rice, which is healthier for you. The roll that came out was very good, the fillings complimented each other and it wasn't overbearing like some rolls can be. The sushi that came out was a piece of yellowtail, 2 salmon, and 2 tuna. All of them were fresh and tasty. I think this might be the best sushi place in Arizona... can't decide between this and Mido....But for $15, a roll and 5 pieces of sushi is a very good deal. I will very likely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food, service, and fair prices.  I would say this is the best sushi in Phoenix.  Try the blue fin when they have it."}
{"text":"This place has no online menu and when I called to ask they said please refer to the photos on yelp. I found the menu on yelp and wrote down my order (teriyaki chicken kitchen entree) and was told they have stopped serving that plate 2 years ago. I asked if they had any grab and go sushi and guess what? THEY WERE OUT (called after 8PM before 9 PM). 

I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place after reading all the reviews. I ordered the mango crunchy roll and the Philly roll. They were just ok for $20. I was expecting more unfortunately than what I had. I didn't even finish the rolls, they just didn't taste that great. Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Was in town and craving sushi so looked on Yelp and this place was very highly reviewed.  It's a very unassuming place so when we walked in, didn't think it would be too special, especially bc reading through the menu, all the rolls seemed to have crab salad or eel sauce as an ingredient.  DO NOT BE TURNED OFF - everything was SO GOOD!  Dinner for 3 was only $60 before tip, and really good quality.  We ordered:

- ahi tuna taco - the best thing we had, order it! Really great flavors!
- caterpillar - all the rolls are white and black rice mixed together to make purple rice. Really good texture and flavor!
- shrimp tempura - greate shrimp flavor
- Cali crunch - really good texture 
- spicy tuna - I usually love spicy tuna but was not crazy about this
- gyoza - really crispy!

Really nice service! Definitely must do"}
{"text":"Consistently great quality, great flavor and great prices. My favorite sushi spot in the valley hands down!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi ever!  We always bring out of town guests to Harumi and they all agree.  My three and five year old love it too.  Seems like we eat here every time we are downtown.  Owner is really nice.  He always stops by our table to say hello and makes our kids feel special."}
{"text":"I freaking love sushi. And this place has never disappointed me. Their sushi comes with purple rice and it is so good! Quick service and superior food. Come by if you want great sushi!! Today I'll habe the ahi tuna tower lunch special. Comes with miso soup, a mini ahi tower, 2 jalepeno poppers, and 3 pieces of sashimi for $15."}
{"text":"Love the black rice. My son and I orders 4 rolls and the jalapeño appetizer. We loved the appetizer and the AZ roll was our favorite. The place was very busy!"}
{"text":"I come here once a week to get my fresh sushi fix. There is a reason why this place is always busy during lunch. First of all, everyone here does their best to quickly accommodate you and give you the best customer service possible. They have amazing sushi lunch specials and you get fresh fish without breaking the bank. 
One of my favorites is their poke bowl and for $13 you get a big poke bowl with fresh chunks of fish. I cannot even finish it.
I will be coming back here weekly to get my fix. Yummmm."}
{"text":"Great sushi! We got chicken dumplings, spider roll, H3 roll, and OMG roll. Everything  tasted great. The OMG roll is really cool, because they light it on fire! Definitely try the OMG roll!"}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh and delicious sushi!i highly recommend to crunch crab roll! Service was great and our sushi came out quickly!"}
{"text":"A group of 6 (4 adults, 2 children) of us came here for dinner before we went to go watch the Nutcracker at the Orpheum Theater. I had looked up sushi places in the area and this one came back with great reviews. After having eaten there, I completely understand why. 

We got there as soon as they opened and was immediately greeted by the staff and sushi chefs, which is customary of sushi/Japanese restaurants. Having lived in Japan for 9 years, it's always great to be greeted by the staff in a similar manner. The staff was extremely friendly and answered all our questions. We were met with the same service being the only family there in the beginning and when the restaurant filled up. They make you feel comfortable and you get a sense of pride and that they're happy you came in. We ordered a handful of rolls; more than what could fit on the small tables. Unlike other restaurants that will just bring you everything and have you sort of figure out spacing, they brought out only a few rolls at a time and were patient in waiting until you've eaten what was brought before bringing the next dish. The main chef (who I believe is also one of the owners) came out frequently to check out to see that everyone in the restaurant was doing good and that the food was to their liking. The chefs were also very accommodating to the two children and even asked if could prepare any of the rolls differently for them. Service like that is very appreciated and something you don't see in a lot of other restaurants. The pricing for the rolls were decent and for the quality of the ingredients used, definitely worth it.

If you are going to try any roll, I would recommend the Oh My God Roll. It's quite the presentation, but the flavor combination is just delicious. Their sashimi is melt in your mouth good.

As you leave, all the staff greets you as you leave and the chefs all smile and say goodbye."}
{"text":"The sushi here is delicious! However, DO NOT order the \"OMG roll\" because it is DISGUSTING. It doesn't say on the menu that is come wrapped in foil and is delivered to you by a waitress wafting it over a plate of fire. The OMG roll tastes what I expect a big gulp of lighter fluid would taste like and, in our experience, was inedible.

All the rest of our food was fantastic, so this place is totally worth eating at! My only other wish for this place is that they had a better/bigger beer/alcohol menu."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem! BEST sushi in Phoenix!!!!
The Oh My God Roll is delicious and has a really great flavor... H3, can't go wrong. 
Fresh, amazing quality and creative, colorful, presentations.

Be good to the staff and the owner, they are all kind and helpful. Depending on what time of the week, or evening, the restaurant can get busy. IF your food happens to take longer than expected, order another sake or green tea, take it easy and be a decent human being. Be gracious and patient, because in the end, you will get a phenomenal meal."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi! The chef even gave us a free sample! The purple rice was an interesting twist!"}
{"text":"I went on a Monday, around 7:30 and was happily surprised at how busy they were.  I took that as a good indicator of the quality of their food.  This is the best Sushi I have had in Phoenix. It's the only one I've tried that \"dressed\" up their salmon and tuna.  Service was excellent.  Recommend for you So Cal peeps jonzen for sushi."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! Must try the OMG roll as it is out of this world. Only gave 4 stars due to lack of atmosphere."}
{"text":"The husband and I went to Harumi a couple weekends ago on our self made 'food crawl.' We were going to go to Squid Ink (which I like very much), but decided to come here as they have such wonderful reviews. Now, this review isn't totally fair because we only tried one roll, so maybe other items are much better. Anyway, this place is set up kind of fast foodish, definitely set for the lunch crowd. This made it a little confusing at first whether we should line up at the counter or sit at a table. We were then directed to sit at a table by a young waitress who was friendly, but awkward. We ordered just a spicy tuna roll to see how this place did basic sushi. Then we proceeded to wait and wait and wait. After awhile. the waitress brought some edamame since we had to wait so long (guess they had a big party tray to make?), so that was nice of her. When we finally got the roll, I noticed there were no little dishes to put soy sauce/wasabi..... and no one to be seen to ask for one. Oh well. The spicy tuna roll was kind of terrible.... I am no expert on spicy tuna rolls, but the ones I have had in the past were a slice of tuna or a minced tuna in the roll...this was like a tuna mush. There was absolutely no texture. Putting in my mouth was awful...it felt like fishy baby food. The purple rice was nothing special, not any better than regular rice. Anyway, after choking this roll down we then waited and waited and waited some more for our check. The place was not busy enough to warrant the ridiculous wait times. I won't be rushing back here for sure."}
{"text":"Living in Phoenix it's extremely hard to find an amazing sushi place. Until now! 

First, this is the first place I've ever been to where the rice is purple! I came for the first time with my friend and every roll I got was amazing. I wish they had a website because I couldn't remember what was exactly in my rolls. My favorite was the H3 roll and the Oh my gosh roll. You will definitely like this one. The name speaks for itself. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. My friend was also friends with one of the chefs so he let us try some rolls he made. Everything was so fresh! I brought home the leftovers and they still tasted yummy the next day. I wish I could come here everyday!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in dt!!! Did I tell you they only use forbidden black rice? For those of you who are thinking ew black rice, well it has way more antioxidants and fiber than brown rice. It's the healthiest rice out there. Despite the small spaces interior, this place is always busy because their food is amazing!!!! My favorite is the Omg roll and the H3 roll!! Yum!! Actually all their rolls are absolute heaven!! And at the end, the owner came by and dropped off peach mango mochi ice cream for us. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Purple rice sushi very interesting.. Very tasty, and dishes came out super quick. Service was nice."}
{"text":"I use to love this place, but after finding hair in my sushi..TWICE...I have gone toward a new lunch place instead"}
{"text":"Small place with a big sushi menu.  Lots of cool rolls with all types for various tastes."}
{"text":"My hotel concierge recommended this restaurant and I was extremely satisfied. The purple rice was delicious. I had the Ahi Tower and I'm pretty picky, if you're a tower lover you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I usually go to the HARUMI Sushi which became my favorite place! The place is located at 7th ave which means it is very reachable place. They use purple rice and it is supposed to be healthier. I got sushi combo, tuna nigiri, yellowtail sashimi, OMG roll and spider roll. Tuna was really fresh and yellowtail was really good!! I could feel them and they looks fancy and tasty. It absolutely tastes good and casual atmosphere make me comfortable. The servers were friendly and chefs, Juno and Choi, were nice! Harumi will definitely not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Craving sushi, this was the answer in downtown Phoenix. My brother and I split many items, the highlights being the seaweed salad, fresh wasabi, yellowtail nigiri, tuna tataki and pink mochi (compliments of the chef!). The purple rice was interesting and, to be honest, I didn't think that it was too appealing. But, the taste was just the same as regular white rice to me. The chef was great and talked to us throughout the meal given that we were seated near the bar (the only place to really be at a sushi place!). This is worth a stop if you need to get your sushi fix."}
{"text":"Seriously really good sushi here, with some unique rolls that are great. The atmosphere is pretty underwhelming so don't expect it to be a good spot for a super romantic date night, but if you just want good sushi this is one of the best spots downtown."}
{"text":"Harumi is one of the better sushi restaurants in Downtown Phoenix.  The staff is always friendly, no matter how busy they are and no matter how rowdy their  customers get.

They are great at making recommendations from their menu.  My new favorite is the Ahi Tower.  It's beautiful and packed with flavor!  

If you are in the downtown area I would recommend Harumi.  It's not as swanky as some of their competition, but the fish here tastes fresher and service is more attentive.  One thing to note: the rice they use is purple-colored.  If you read the explanation on the monitor you learn that it's a super-food.  I love this concept!  I have taken visitors here on several occasions and they've all ended up loving Harumi!"}
{"text":"Juno and the staff are just amazing! We come here almost weekly. My boyfriend is from San Diego and this sushi always hits the spot even as a CA guy! Try this place and you will not be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Fresh and well-presented food, great service and excellent location. First time with purple rice for sushi but it works. They have a few unique beers like Orion that are hard to find even at many restaurants in Japan."}
{"text":"I dropped by Harumi sushi for a quick dinner, around 8pm. It seemed pretty busy but I got my food quickly. You order off a paper menu, checking things off. I had a three mini roll combo and two types of nigiri: scallops and seared tuna. 

I didn't love the rolls but the nigiri were good, with fresh fish and good proportioning between rice and fish. For a quick, no frills sushi dinner, I would be back, but would stick to nigiri. The purple rice was fun and different - I prefer white rice but they pull it off okay."}
{"text":"One of the best places in the Sonoran Desert for sushi!  If you want to go for lunch, go early, otherwise you may be waiting to join all in eating many different delicious rolls.  The service and the presentation is fantastic and the pricing is very fair!  My favorite spot downtown for Sushi!"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever. I loved the chirashi bowl. The fish was amazing!"}
{"text":"Yummmm. I worked around the corner and loved this place. Try the Harumi roll. It's great!"}
{"text":"I used to work here but the sushi is great! I didn't like the owner as a co-worker but the sushi is great again. I still go there sometimes. I love the salmon sashimi here"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here. The sushi is relatively inexpensive compared to other places, you get more what you pay for, and the sushi is very good. The only issue I have is I have eaten there a few times and of those times there have been instances where they would forget to bring things that I ordered when they get busy. But they were very reasonable and took the items off my tickets."}
{"text":"Quality, value, service all great. Big portions as well and great service, not a fancy spot but good for sushi when you need a go to spot"}
{"text":"The best sushi in AZ bar none. I don't give 5 stars easily, however this place easily earns it. 

Went for my birthday and it was just a lot of fun, one of the best nights out I've had in a while. This restaurant treated me like family going above and beyond what I would typically expect.

The omakase I got was amazing, each piece was fresh full of flavor. There was plenty of variety and almost every piece was a super premium item. Each bite was almost magical. I felt like this plate elsewhere would easily go for at least double what I paid. 

Chef Juno is a lot of fun. You can tell that he really enjoys what he does and his energy is infectious. Every time I've visited, he always sits down and makes sure you're having a good time too. He's also really generous sometimes giving free samples which are really tasty."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for a few days at a conference, and had the good fortune of eating at Harumi Sushi late one evening.  A day earlier I had eaten at Squid Ink, which I thought was good and I especially liked the set-up and atmosphere there.  You don't find this ambiance at Harumi Sushi; however, in my opinion the sushi at Harumi Sushi is more memorable.  Harumi Sushi uses black rice.  I asked about this and was told that they use it because it is healthier, even though it is more expensive.  I loved the rice.  I ordered yellowtail, eel, squid, and octopus.  It was all very good and fresh.  The eel was one of the best I have ever tasted.  At many places I feel the sauce served on eel is too sweet; that was not the case here.  

I'm back in the Los Angeles area now, and there are many good sushi places here.  I particularly like Sugar Fish.  However, Harumi Sushi was special and I hope that I get to return to Phoenix so that I can eat there again.  If you are in the Phoenix area and like sushi, I highly recommend that you give Harumi Sushi a try."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Highly recommend 
Had the Las Vegas and H3 roll and both were delicious"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! Best place in Arizona that I've found that has good quality sushi! The service was great - everyone greeted us and said goodbye. The sushi came out extremely fast! It is beautifully made. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best sushi in Phoenix! Great service in a cute little spot downtown. Reminiscent of a sushi restaurant in Japan, the service is extra fast, quality is top notch, and price is extremely fair."}
{"text":"TLDR;
Friendly staff, great atmosphere, amazing value for price, and even better quality food! Will definitely return!

Wow! So glad my first time was on a holiday! No line, no wait, and still excellent service! Got there late-ish around 8:15PM and parked in the lot in the back. $5 parking/hr during business hours. Max $15. 

*Pro tip: For parking you can download the mobile app (Parkmobile) ahead of time in case you don't want to pay on site or if there's a crowd.*

First thing I remember smelling as I walked in was the tempura batter. Also, I was surprised there was no conventional sushi bar. However the chefs were very friendly and still greeted every customer who came in, ordered, and left. I felt very welcome and appreciated for my patronage.

*Pro tip: Place is small, so preferable for a small group (6 or less) or  dinner date possibly pre/post orpheus*

Was feeling indecisive but very hungry. Opted for the Omakase (chef's choice) and hot green tea (which wasn't as strong as I was expecting since I didn't let the tea steep very long). Multiple staff members offered to refill my tea with more hot water throughout the course of my meal, which I found charming, but ultimately unnecessary since I don't tolerate really hot beverages well.

The personalized order took about 15 minutes to prepare, but it was truly worth the wait. Not only was it picture worthy, but it was of impecable quality. Had a large variety of fish, preparation styles, textures, and flavors. However each order had one thing in common.  They were all exceptionally delicious. 

*Pro tip: If you have dietary restrictions or are food texturally challenged, you can still order Omakase, just tell them ahead of time!*

While eating I took notice of the decor and entertainment. The walls were lined with photographs and decorations that had probably seen better days. There was a korean variety show on the television but the sound was off and subtitles were scarse...so unless you read Korean, don't expect to understand/follow much of what you see.

At the end of my meal the chef asked what I thought, if I was satisfied, and then politely thanked me again. Payment was seemless  and without error despite not being itemized. I would have liked to have gotten dessert, but they were closing...and this way gives me one more excuse to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now when I'm in town. I've tried a lot of sushi around the country and this remains as some of my favorite. Have gotten the Ahi Tower both times and it does not disappoint. Love the purple rice and the whole dish has great flavor and is quite filling. Service is also very good and friendly. Already looking forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"This place is so weird. We walk in and are asked if we have reservations. We didn't. The place was totally empty so I didn't see it as a problem. We were sat right in front of the bar and asked for a table instead. We were told it was for a party of 4 or larger. Irritated because the place was empty we sat down and ordered some sake. After our first shot we were asked to order. We said no thank you, we are just going to enjoy our sake until we are ready. We got told we had to order because we couldn't just drink. I tried explaining we wanted to eat, but not yet. The waiter said we had to order food. Feeling uncomfortable we paid for our sake and left. This was by far the weirdest dining experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"A long narrow space that is comfortable with large wooden tables with plenty of space between them.  The sushi is was very good, especially given that no ocean is nearby.  The one standout was the 'Oh My God' roll.  It comes wrapped in tinfoil and they set it on fire at your table.  It is an odd bbq fusion that really works.  The best roll I have had in a long time.  It's not Vancoucer but it is pretty dam good. 

I'm not convinced that the purple rice actually has any material health benifits but it is a unique twist I hadn't seen before.  Not really a material difference in taste."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi place with cheap prices and decent decor. I went there with a friend for lunch and both of us got the nigiri sushi + crazy roll combo. They have this special purple rice (supposed to be good for your health :)) which makes the rolls slightly more colorful. Their fish portions are good and tasty. Definitely recommended for a quick meal."}
{"text":"This is probably more appropriate for a \"TIP\" but I couldn't figure out how to write one on my desktop.  Anyway, I saw a sign that they are no longer going to serve lunch bento boxes and that it will just be the full service menu at lunch.  Also, they now offer daily specials!  When I went, they had a blue fin tuna special."}
{"text":"We are 4 guys that frequently eat out. If anyone in the group will find SOMETHING wrong with the food, it's going to be me. Honestly, I can't say enough good about this place! First, we love to eat local. It appears to be owned by a Japanese couple, and they are sure to remain present and visible. They're very friendly. One of the friends has been here before during the day, and they remembered him and commented that he'd never been there for dinner. Impressive. The wife came over and looked at what we ordered, told us that 1. we were ordering the wrong rolls (she was right) and 2. we were ordering too much (she was right again). The chef (husband) came out from behind the counter and spoke with us, truly showed his appreciation and gratitude for us coming in. They sent out a few pieces of seared salmon that they were trailing that wasn't yet on the menu, and it was delicious (although I prefer my sushi raw). The wait staff was friendly and attentive. The prices, I felt, were very fair, especially because they use purple rice, which is healthier and more expensive in general (and DELICIOUS). The atmosphere is what you'd expect from a local family-owned restaurant - not a huge dining room, nothing extravagant or over-the-top, but friendly and quaint. We had a nice brief conversation with the group next to us.

We didn't at first order the Oh My God roll, but man am I glad the owner suggested it! It's incredible. They light it on fire when they bring it out. And I understand how it got its name. Oh my God...really delicious. I had suggested it to the group next to us, and I heard the one gal say, \"Oh my God\" when she tried it. We also got the blue fin combo, the Philly salmon roll, the crunch roll, the caterpillar roll and I don't even remember what else. It really was all so good. It's been a while since I've had a meal that fulfilling. We planned on having leftovers, but we ended up eating everything (and we probably ordered enough for 6 or 7 people). I'm glad the owner dissuaded us from ordering more.

We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow!!! It was very good and Purple rice....don't be alarmed,the flavor it adds is complimentary.  The shrimp tempura roll is the best I have ever had.  I didn't love the crazy roll but the nigiri that accompanied it was thick and fresh.  If I lived here, I would eat it regularly. If in on business look no further for your sushi fix."}
{"text":"This sushi place introduced me to black rice in there . Completely different and Fabulous! I had what they call the H3 roll which had a bit of spicy creamy tuna & salmon based with a spicy mayo. The combination was out of this world. I was surprised with the personalized service. Plus get there early it gets packed on a Saturday night! Great sake too. But exquisite sushi by far!! Best in Phoenix for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The staff has character, personality, and are super helpful. The atmosphere is relaxed and enlivening, adding flavor to a mostly greyscale, vaporous, and boring downtown. Now let's get serious! THE SUSHI: the sushi is made with a purple rice, tastes delightfully fresh, and yes, it is delicious. I will be back, many times."}
{"text":"After only 3 visits to Harumi, it's become our go-to sushi place and worthy of a 5 star review.  The quality of the fish is the best we've had in Phoenix, and they have great prices and really original specialty rolls.  The main owner/worker usually sends a small plate of complimentary sushi to the table as a starter.  

Don't come here for the ambiance (florescent light radiates the entire restaurant from the kitchen) but definitely come here for fresh, great sushi at reasonable prices.  A great Yelp find worthy of making the trek downtown."}
{"text":"This is among the best sushi I've had in Phoenix. We came in hungry and tried... about half the menu it felt like. All of the sushi was great. The purple rice was interesting and I liked the texture. The only dish I had that I thought was mediocre was the fried rice. But the sushi was good enough to overlook that 1 slight hiccup.

Downtown parking can, at times, be a problem. But it is worth the trip. We will be back in the next time we are downtown."}
{"text":"Came back yesterday for my birthday dinner and decided Harumi deserves a re-review.  I wish the additional 5 stars here added to my previous 5 stars, because Harumi really merits 10/5 stars, not just 5/5 stars.

I can now say that Harumi is hands-down the best sushi venue in the valley.  I'm not sure that I'll even be able to eat at any other sushi restaurants again, since I had such an excellent experience at Harumi.  Not only did we get a personal visit from Chef Juno (he even gave my mom his phone number! 911-911 baby), the food was absolutely delicious.  I had the Omakase (where you let the chef make whatever he wants) and it was worth every penny.  Every bite was amazing.  I'm in sushi heaven still."}
{"text":"Three of us stopped in for dinner after flying into Phoenix. It was a small place in the middle of several businesses that didn't shout out as being a look at me type of place. I ordered the spicy tuna roll and thought it was amazing! Everything seemed fresh which made us wonder how it got to Phoenix without getting frozen. Either way it was good. The prices are on the high side. I think for 4 rolls and three beers it came to $80.00. You will spend a little money here but it's good."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Very fresh toro and tasty rolls (some traditional and some unique). I'd come back next time I'm in town. Service was a bit odd. Had 3 different servers and got asked the same questions multiple times. Very friendly staff though."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi! Order when you walk in and pay then sit and they bring it to your table! Favorites are the OMG and the vegas roll! Made with purple rice!"}
{"text":"New favorite sushi place right in Downtown. I've never been to the lunch service but I have been to the dinner service multiple times without complaints. Even on busy nights, service is always quick and never disappointing. We have our favorites,  the Arizona Roll one of them. Phenomenal. The entire staff is friendly and I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley, hands down. If you haven't tried it, you're missing out. Weekends are always super busy but totally worth the wait"}
{"text":"Firstly, the dudes behind the counter are legit. They know exactly what they're doing, and because the place isn't accommodating too many people, they can artfully and carefully craft their creations. 

The yellowtail was some of the best I've ever had outside of Los Angeles. The sushi is light, well portioned and proportioned. I never felt like \"This could use a little of this/that\".

Also... what is it about that purple rice? It's subtle, but I find it to be a superior vehicle for the fish to white rice. Maybe I drank the Kool-aid, but who cares?  I'm in!

I encourage you to go. My stomach is literally growling as I write this review."}
{"text":"Super good sushi, with a great varietah.  We got 4 rolls, gyoza, miso soup AND two beers for $55.  What the what???  Can't wait to go again :)"}
{"text":"OMG!!! I am totally in love with this place, we came here before a Suns game and surprisingly it wasn't slammed. We quickly got sat and had our drinks within minutes. This place was really cozy, I liked how the \"sushi rollers\" were right there in front of everyone rolling the sushi. We got some potstickers as appetizers, and ordered like 3 rolls. 1 was definitely Las Vegas, the sex and the city, and another one don't remember. They were all delicious!!!! Writing about it is making me crave it again, everything tasted fresh. We already had a lot of food on our table and the waitress brought us some sashimi on the house. Im not a big fan but I tried it and it was pretty good. I couldn't really understand what she was calling it by my nephew loved it and ate it all except the one I tried. I was surely impressed with the service and the food and will be back. Im willing to make the drive from the east valley for this chow."}
{"text":"I was out in Phoenix for a business trip and after searching on yelp I found this place. Located downtown ( or what I think is considered) I walked from my hotel ( Hyatt ) and found this place. The sushi was great, really fresh, reasonability priced and the staff was very helpful. My rolls were pretty spicy, but I didn't mind. I a few rolls and they used purple rice, I had never seen such a thing. I don't think I will be back in AZ anytime soon, but I was glad I stumbled unpon this place while I was in town!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix. Junio is the owner. He's a showman and has a very good restaurant."}
{"text":"Harumi sushi..! En mi primer experiencia..! En este lugar.,! Soy amante del sushi y creo que este lugar sea convertido en uno de mis favoritos.limpio,comida excelente ambiente muy adecuado al lugar limpio y rápido. Gracias a Roxana por la atención que nos dio..!"}
{"text":"Literally the only place I go to for sushi and sashimi. Anything you order is generously portioned, beautiful, and melt-in-your-mouth fresh. Staff is friendly too. Seating is limited, but you never really have to wait long, and I personally think that adds to the appeal of this Downtown Phx gem."}
{"text":"We popped in here late in the lunch hour and considered ourselves very lucky. This might be some of the best sushi I have ever eaten. Extremely dedicated to the craft with purple rice and fresh, flavorful ingredients. We sampled six different rolls and three different sashimis. All were amazing. The miso soup is wonderful, the tempura is lightly battered and fresh, the service was terrific, and the sake bombs ... well... they lit the party. Can't wait to go back and try the green tea ice cream too. This little gem is going to be your favorite sushi place too. Hit them up!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was inexpensive, delicious and came out quick."}
{"text":"Crazy roll was amazing! Employees were extremely friendly and very attentive. Everything we had was delicious!"}
{"text":"Whoever said you can't get good sushi in the desert hasn't eaten here. Harumi has some of the best sushi at the most affordable prices I've had in the Valley. Their grab-n-go options usually are excellent, although later in the day the selection may be limited. Dining in is a rare treat for me, and when I do get to escape the office Harumi offers some of the best service.

I've turned my coworker on to the amazing food at Harumi, too."}
{"text":"Sooo goood ! Sushi chef's special salmon nigiri was a bomb! :) we ordered sashimi salad, rainbow roll, H3 roll, and dynimite roll. All of them were very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I ordered salmon sashimi, and checked in for a free miso soup and edamame which was awesome! :D I got a very generous portion of sashimi and it was yum yum yummy! I also usually never use wasabi (after a scarring incident when I first tried wasabi), but the sashimi came with a wasabi/green onion sauce on it, and it actually tasted pretty good! It also cleared my sinuses up right away, which makes me feel like I'll crave it when I'm sick. xD

Anyways, service was also very good and fast! The waitresses were super nice. (:"}
{"text":"I am not a timid sushi eater. In the blink of an eye I will have inhaled 30 pieces of all the sushi without spilling a drop of soy sauce. But damn, Harumi! You got me waddling out of here with my pants undone. 

They've only got sushi on the menu -- and damn do they do it right. Lightning fast service, generous slices of fresh fish (and like 12 pieces to a roll!), and the use of black rice instead of white was perfectly portioned and delectable. Yeah, I said it. Delectable. 

They also had some killer toro specials we didn't try, so I'll dream about them later. Bottom line? If ever I'm back in Phoenix I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"What a gem!  This was another great Yelp find.  To start, the service is outstanding.  A true team effort.  The food came quick.  The value for your money is exceptional for a downtown sushi spot.  Portions are generous.  The sashimi is very reasonable priced.  Fish is very fresh.  Come here!"}
{"text":"I had my doubts about good sushi in Phoenix, considering that the ocean is far from visible. But after reading the numerous positive reviews about this place, I decided to bring my colleague to check it out. We walked over on a Monday night, and were seated right away. Service was already excellent--the hostess and the server were both smiley and friendly, and gave us the appropriate amount of time to decide what we wanted.

Food selections:
1. Gyoza (4/5, $5): By all means, standard. No other way to describe it.
2. Veggie tempura (3/5, $4): I think the menu says 5 pieces, but upon first glance, it's a pretty big plate of tempura. Also standard. I thought the yam and squash (?) pieces were a bit undercooked, though.
3. Spicy tuna roll (4/5, $6): Pretty good. Nice proportion of rice to fish, and it's pleasantly spicy, and quite fresh.
4. Spicy salmon roll (3.5/5, $6): Just okay. Not as fresh as the tuna that time. I'd probably go for the spicy tuna because that's usually something you can't go wrong with (unless you don't eat raw fish). Spicy salmon just sounded exotic to me.
5. H3 roll (5/5, $13): This is also an exotic-sounding roll, consisting of spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy yellowtail, and other fillings. While the fish in this are all described as spicy, I would not call the roll spicy. It simply has a slight kick to it. Definitely flavorful, as well as recommended.

All this came out to just under $37. Pretty darn good! Oh, about that purple rice... I'm no rice and grains expert, but I don't think it tastes that different from brown rice, and the texture is drastically different from white rice. But I do think it filled me more easily, which is nice, because it made for a cheaper dinner :p"}
{"text":"Is this the best sushi I've ever had? No, but omakase for $35 is a great deal! There was nothing exotic but there was 6 pieces of tuna sashimi, 3 pieces of seared tuna, 3 pieces of seared salmon belly, 2 pieces of tuna nigiri, 2 pieces of salmon nigiri, 2 pieces of spicy tuna nigiri, and some other goodies I devoured so quickly that only my tummy remembers.

The service was fast and the fish was fresh. It was a great value! I would've loved to try one of the cool rolls; maybe next time."}
{"text":"I am a sushi snob from California and this is by far one of the best sushi restaurants I've been to! So fresh and so good."}
{"text":"Food was just ok.  There were only three rolls on the menu that wasn't fried(tempura) or that did not have cream cheese.  Service was terrible.  We got a seat right away but waited ten minutes to get a menu. Waitress forgot about our drink order so after 15 more minutes we requested the same drinks from a different waitress.  Never received a follow up to see if we needed anything else.  We had to leave our table to ask for our check at the register."}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi that I've found in Phoenix.  The prices are reasonable and the sushi is excellent.  This sushi shop isn't one of those affected locations where you'll feel like you need to dress up.  The owners are on site often and overall, this is our favorite place to go for sushi.  I HIGHLY recommend the Oh My God roll.  It was named well.  It is my favorite roll anywhere."}
{"text":"Probably the most enjoyable sushi experience I've had in Arizona so far! The place was super busy at 8pm (we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table of two), but that inspires confidence in the circulation and freshness of their fish. We ordered the seaweed salad, spicy salmon roll, sweet potato roll, and oasis roll. Portions were pretty good for the price. My favorite was the oasis roll, but everything was great. At the end, the chef gave us two complementary pieces of nigiri (perhaps because we were seated in front of the sushi prep area?) as \"dessert\"! I will definitely be back to try their other rolls."}
{"text":"Location: its located in the middle of downtown area. Lots of booths and sitting areas. 

Service: You basically purchase your items at the cashier and eat in if you'd like or you can take it to go. Staffs are friendly and they are super busy during lunch hour. 

Food: all sushi items came with brown rice. Its unique and delicious. I got the 5 pieces combo + a soda + tips = $22. Its a bit pricey but reasonable for downtown area. 

Rating: I'll come back here again to try other item."}
{"text":"Very nice vegan options for sushi and a nice atmosphere and nice staff.  I like to come here and enjoy it every time I do."}
{"text":"I found this sushi bar on Yelp and wanted to give it a try. We ordered a spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, a sex and the city roll, and tamago. All were very fresh and delicious. I saw online that they had a grab and go station, but when I visited, it was empty so I sat and wait for my to-go order. No big deal, it was only a short wait and I had enough change in the meter. Parking wasn't bad, but I can imagine that during prime times it could be a bit of a challenge to find a spot. Make sure to bring some change for the meter! Definitely recommend this place. The only small downfall for me was that the sushi rice was a bit sweeter than I am used to. Still good, but I do like the regular rice better. The fish was all fantastic! Next time I will try some appetizers."}
{"text":"Really good. I've tried a bunch of things over the years, and everything has been great. The \"Oh my god\" roll is my favorite (with a little fire show on your table) and \"finding Nemo\" probably a close second.  Their rainbow roll is just tuna and salmon, which is pretty good though not quite a rainbow. 

The purple rice is pretty unique, and definitely try the real wasabi.

It's a bit small and has been getting more and more popular, so there can be a bit of a wait during busy times. Good service and the nice people, even when they're packed."}
