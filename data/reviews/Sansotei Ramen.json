{"text":"Sansotei serves some top notch ramen. They take no reservations, so my company of five had to wait outside for about half an hour. I guess it's normal for Saturday night. Unlike my favorite ramen place in NYC you can only order what's on a menu. No deviations or improvisations whatsoever. Our waitress didn't speak much English, and even after writing everything down still managed to make a mistake or two. But, my spicy sesame ramen called Tan Tan was exceptional. I can tell you that. Just the right thickness of broth, and taste - omg."}
{"text":"Very fast service. Loves their Tonkotsu ramen. The broth was rich and delicious. Their slow cooked chicken wings were delicious as well. They reminded me of Cantonese style soya sauce wings. Also try the Tan Tan ramen on another visit. I didn't like that as much as I thought I would."}
{"text":"Lucked out and didn't have to wait long for a table of 2. We had a gyoza to start and I had the Tonkotsu Black Ramen with a sapparo. The broth was delicious with the black oil+garlic flavor. Perfect! For a cold day.  The noodles weren't over cooked which is very important IMO."}
{"text":"Very friendly, nice simple decor and the food was delicious! Tonkotsu ramen had great flavour and the pork was not full of grissel  (my pet peevd) Gyoza looks handmade and cooked just right...def recommend for a quick bite."}
{"text":"3.5. we went on a Monday night, almost empty which means no line up, good for us.  ordered Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen, Miso Ramen and Gyoza. one thick nooddle and one original. I liked the thick noodle, it's more chewy.   Soup base tasted almost the same between the two ramens. I liked the creamy soup but it was too salty and the meat was too fat... also, their portion is on a smaller side compare to other ramen places.   Gyoza was just a soso, nothing impressive about it really and i think the 4.50 price is too much for 4 pieces."}
{"text":"Reviewed during: Mon - Fri Lunch time Service Speed: 3.5 / 5 Cooking speed: 3.5 / 5 Food Quality: 5 / 5 Food Quantity: 4 / 5 Price: 4 / 5  Cleanness: 5 / 5  Repeat: Yes  There's very limited seating. So you will be lining up on the street as there's no room inside the restaurant to line up. I ordered the extra noodle option, it's well worth the money. The broth taste really good. The noodle was done just right. But my biggest complaint is the ridiculously small amount of meat in the bowl!  The Deep fried Chicken is tender and juicy. I would definitely order it again.  I would recommend to arrive before 11:40am to avoid lining up at weekday lunch time."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Mmmmm garlic oil in ramen is a must try! It's a little small and cramped though so only good for a quick in and out session."}
{"text":"The tonkotsu and miso were my favorites. I always get the thick noodles with extra noodles which are very good. The broth is also not too salty, and goes well with the noodles. The only complaint I would have is they only give 2 pieces of pork which are also quite small. I also tried their cold tea once, and would never try it again. Was very bitter, and tasted like black coffee, but maybe that's just me.  Overall, very good place and would definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite ramen... until I spent a week in Osaka. Probably still the best tasting one in Toronto."}
{"text":"Just choice of 6 noodles. But .... always full house and lineup on the street. Excellent !"}
{"text":"Awesome portions for price and great tasting broth with clearly freshly made noodles!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best ramen shops. I am very picky with ramen and my broths since I'm not a ramen fan but this place made me a ramen lover! I had the shio ramen which was amazing! Also the mochi ice cream was a great treat. It was soft and melts right in your mouth.  The atmosphere is a bit tight but cozy and the service is friendly. There usually is a line up after 6pm, so it's best to get there before the dinner line up.  Food 5/5 Atmosphere 4/5 Service 5/5  I have revisited this place on more than one occasion and plan to return."}
{"text":"Came here at 4:30PM on a cold Saturday afternoon and no line up at all, yay! I am an avid noodle fan and have tried all the ramen joints around Toronto (and pretty much every city I visit) and this is definitely one of the top ones in the city. I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen with original noodles, the broth was delicious, flavourful, and not too salty. The egg was cooked perfectly (medium rare). The pork was tender and fatty. I was disappointed about the noodle, it was overcooked and not chewy enough (maybe it's just an off day for them) but I much prefer the noodle at Kinton Ramen.   Love: Delicious broth. Spacious, comfortable seating  Hate: Overcooked noodles"}
{"text":"I regularly eat here for lunch.  This is the real deal in terms of ramen, and the prices are reasonable.  Vegetarians beware there; all the soups are pork bone broth, there's no vegetarian option!  The broth is in fact excellent, and so is the noodles and the meat.  The one and only complaint I have is that the eggs in the broth, while delicious, are always cold, even though the broth is piping hot; no doubt the 'precook' the eggs, put them in the fridge, then plop them right in the broth.  Dock them a star for that.  Otherwise, the food is great!"}
{"text":"Poor service and instant noodles! Bait and switch tactic to reel in customers It's a fake HongKong place selling Japanese food.  Never going back again! One of the worst places I've been! MSG through the roof! Had to drink a pitcher of water when I got home!"}
{"text":"I'd like their tonkatsu black, quality is good overall, portion is just right but would consider small for some.  They serve Asahi black.  Seating is ideal for group of 6 at most, otherwise getting a seat can be a challenge since it's quite popular.  For a ramen fix in Markham, I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"I tried their chicken wings and black ramen. The wings are bad, salty but not tasty. The ramen is on average, not special but nothing to complain. Since they have a very long waiting line, they asked me every three minutes and try to rush me out... overall it's a ban experience."}
{"text":"A really great ramen shop in Markham! Finally, you don't have to head south into Toronto. A great place to get your ramen fix if you're ever craving ramen from Tokyo. FYI, expect line ups and don't come here with a big group. This place isn't a social event. You're here for the food. Go to Milestones or Joey for your social event. The hot bowl in front of you is your only focus. Winter is around the corner so prepare to wait outside cause they are busy but you know it's worth it. Slurp away fellow ramen lovers! Slurp away."}
{"text":"Me and 3 others came here for lunch on a Saturday 3 weeks ago, after waiting in line at Uncle Tetsu's just around the corner. We got there just before 11:30 am and got a booth in the back right away. I had been wanting to try this place out for a while now because of all the good reviews.   I got the Spicy Tantan with thick noodles ($9.60) since there was a limited quantity daily. The others got a Tonkotsu with thin noodles ($9.60), and 2 Tonkotsu Black, with 1 thick & 1 thin ($9.85).  Service was fast. I liked the Spicy Tantan. The thickness of the thick noodles were the kind I liked. It came with not 1 but 2 perfectly cooked soft boiled eggs halves. The pork belly was just a bit too thin for my liking but I prefer it to the overly thick dry ones some other places served. The broth was flavourful and wasn't too spicy so the spiciness doesn't overpower the flavour of the broth, which is one think I'm always afraid of  when I order spicy noodles. I tried a bit the broth from the Tonkotsu and the Tonkotsu Black as well and both were good. The broth might be a bit too salty for broth drinkers though. The portion sizes were just right for lunch, but I think if it was dinner I would need a bit more.     When we left about 40 mins later around 12, there was already a line of about 10 people waiting outside. Overall we really liked our ramens and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came around 8:45pm on a Tues night, last month with the BF. Waited about 10-15mins for a table with 4 tables ahead of us. We were so excited that Sansotei was here in Markham after trying the original DT location earlier this year. The BF has been raving about Sansotei since than, but this time we left not as impressed. Since this is their 3rd store, I think it's natural for people to compare it to the original DT location, and I did so as well.    This time I got the Tonkotsu Black ($9.85) that the BF got last time, and the BF got the Spicy TanTan ($9.60) that I got last time. Both of us got thick noodles. We also both got extra noodles for ($1.50 each). When the noodles came, both our bowls were almost stuffed to the brim with noodles. This made it slightly hard to eat, since the noodles were so packed together. I also noticed you don't get as much soup this way. It was not until afterwards that we realized that you could get the extra noodles on the side, They didn't ask us which way we wanted the extra noodles when we placed our orders. So I would definitely ask for the extra noodles on the side next time.  Taste wise, the Tonkotsu Black broth was pretty similar to the one DT. Don't get it unless you love garlic. I do, but I had major garlic breath the rest of the night. haha. The Spicy TanTan broth was a little more salty than the one DT. Thick noodles were good, thick enough and chewy the way I like it. Eggs were cooked to perfection as well here. The pork belly was slightly tougher and had a bit of a porky taste to it that I don't remember tasting at the DT location. I still find their broth in general a little bit more salty than I would like so I don't drink too much of the broth.    There were a few little things that annoyed us: -They seat you with other people if there are only 2 of you. We ended up at a 6 person table with another couple, seated with a seat between us. Slightly awkward because the other couple talked non-stop and we could hear the entire conversation while we ate. -The entire outside of the ramen bowl was greasy. When we placed our hand on the underside of the bowl to move it closer to us, both our hands got covered in this watery grease. They should have at least wiped the bowl a bit before they served it.  -We asked for water when we ordered our ramen and it didn't show up till we were half done our ramen.  Overall, the ramen here is still pretty good. I'm sure if we didn't have the DT location as comparison, we would have liked it a lot more. If there isn't much of a wait, this is probably one of the better ramen places in the Markham/RH area. I do wish they had a few more sides/apps for me to choose from."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Sansotei Ramen on Dundas Street and I have to say that it keeps getting better each time. Although it is a tiny venue, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, the staff were friendly and attentive and the food was absolutely delicious. Get there early though, the restaurant fills up fairly quickly and there is usually a line-up outside. Tried the Shio ramen, while my husband had tried the Miso with multiple side dishes (edamame, beef bowl, seaweed salad, gyoza) all were delectable! The desserts were simple and yummy: green tea cheesecake and daifuku. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to check this place out because of the hype. Big mistake! We're foodies and like to try now restaurants around Markham. This is the worst ramen place around all the other in the area. - $1 to $2 more than average ramen place around the area - very small portion; you don't feel satisfied - canned tomato base broth - 1 slice of pork belly!!! Like really? Come on!! - charge $2 extra for hot tea!!! - very limited menu selection   Summary: expensive, no so tasty, limited menu selection, small portions, charge for hot tea, 1 piece pork belly!!!  Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"The server rushed the hell out of us because there were people outside waiting for seats. My friend and I both ordered the tonkotsu ramen with thick noodles. She liked it. But for me it's like a sodium explosion. Super salty and greasy. Maybe I should try something else next time."}
{"text":"Very nice Raman!!  The tomato based was very interesting. Nicky done!!  Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"My first visit and I sat on the bar seat closest to the kitchen watching the movement and communication amongst the workers; admiring the efficiency of the entire execution from seating of the guests, order taking, serving, refilling water and finally the bill.  Will I revisit?   You bet.  My advise. Get the extra noodles and the pork belly."}
{"text":"After trying both Kinton and Ajisen Ramen, I asked myself if there was something \"even better\". I looked up the Best Ramen Restaurants on BlogTO and this place was ranked #1. I had to check this place out myself.   The first time I went, I had the Spicy Tantan Ramen ($9.60). I was blown away. From the perfectly cooked thick noodles to the tender egg, every single detail of the Ramen dish is not overlooked. The second time I went I had the Miso Ramen ($9.75). Different tasting broth since it was not spicy, but the same quality that I had the first time around. Every single item in the Ramen is cooked to perfection.   In terms of portions, it's a relatively decent sized bowl for the amount you are paying. It is a little less than Kinton but the quality is miles better. The service is really friendly and fast. I had no trouble with the servers.    The pricing is reasonable too. You won't spend more than $15 unless you order alcohol beverages or extra items onto your Ramen.   The ambiance is really dim with a mixture of modern and minimalist design. Perfect for 2 people eating together/dinner dates. It gets really loud at times.   One downside to this place in the size of the restaurant and the waiting times (if you are dining with 3 or more people). It's a small restaurant and it gets really busy during the late afternoon/dinner time. I don't recommend bringing large groups of people here since you will be waiting at least 10 minutes (outside the restaurant) just to be seated.   On the flip side, this is a terrific Ramen restaurant. The food is consistently spot on in terms of quality and quantity. The pricing is decent and the service is fast and friendly.   Recommendation: Don't be afraid to try new things! For myself, I will be trying the thin noodles next time I come here.     ****5/5 Stars - Recommend this place to all your friends."}
{"text":"It was my first time here at this location and wow, the service was amazing. They allowed us to bring outside drinks (it was 30C+ weather and a line waiting outside), and all the staff who brought our food to our table were so enthusiastic and welcoming. The food was also really good and I liked their soup base more than Kinton, even. The gyoza was a little soggy but it didn't take away from the experience as a whole. Will be back!"}
{"text":"A great place to go in Markham for Ramen if not the best in terms of quality of product produced in the Markham Community.  This is actually my second time heading down there to eat and I usually get the Tonkatsu Black Ramen as it is almost like their specialty of the house.  You can also choose the different type of noodles as they have the thick and thin versions of the noodles, I have tried both and I guess since I am not a foodie it tastes relatively the same to me =P,  but that is just a simple man's eating habits for you haha  I do highly recommend this place if you are looking for a satisfying bowl of soup noodle, especially ramen style, however I do warn you ahead of time that the wait times are relatively lengthy and to come prepared knowing that you might have to wait a good half an hour before seats are available.    PS. Tip though is to make sure you go when it rains as it seems like there are less clients when the weather is rainy, though that is probably true for every restaurants out there haha"}
{"text":"What ramen should be. Incredibly savory broth and the noodles were spot on. A bit of a wait outside on the sidewalk, but great service and was eating just a few minutes after getting a seat and ordering.  Grab a window seat if you can."}
{"text":"Love this place! I would say they have the best ramen in town. Their soup base is just right and isn't too salty. It's a must try!!"}
{"text":"The only complaint I have about this place is that they're too bloody popular!  I totally understand why they are as their food is fantastic, robust in flavour and also a fantastic texture.  I definitely recommend the tonkatsu black and their slow cooked chicken wings.  Make sure you go hungry so you can get their dessert as well.  My experience is to get there at least 20 - 30 minutes before you want to eat."}
{"text":"Thank you Toronto yelpers! This place was everything you raved about and more. Searching for a delicious food one freakishly humid evening in Toronto, I found this place on the Yelp app, my friends and I decided to gave it a try.  I wish my stomic and wallet can affort more of it. It was pleasant experience and a very happy meal.  I will surely visit this place again. Highly recommanded."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the Tonkotsu black and Spicy Tan Tan ramen after much hype over this place and unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. I've had much better ramen before but this was just ok...its nothing special to rave about. The noodles tasted fresh and the broth was satisfying, but the place was too busy on a weekday evening and it felt like they were rushing so they clear the table for people waiting in line. The communal style seating is rather disturbing when you are trying to enjoy your meal and negates the entire experience."}
{"text":"The first ramen restaurant I've been to in Toronto is sansotei  in downtown, it was a small cozy space with polite and friendly waiters. I loved the ramen and desserts there. I decided to try sansotei Markham since it was nearby and convenient. When you first walk in, you had to line up during busy times for a table. As you get seated, the waiters bring you a cup of water and the menu. Ordered the pork belly ramen. The noodles were off and the there was foam in my soup. The food tasted awful. Completely different than my experience at the downtown location. Need to improve on their food. Such a shame downtown ramen was much better and Markham's didn't live up to expectation."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of ramen, but whenever I need it in my system, this is the place I go to! The lineup to eat here can get a bit insane, but when I have that rare ramen craving, I have to say that it's worth the wait.  It doesn't matter what I get, that ramen bowl is always going to taste good."}
{"text":"There's always a long line up so I decided to try it out. I tried the shio ramen. Compared to Kinton and Ryus, this place just taste like instant noodles I can make myself."}
{"text":"I have tried a couple of ramen shops in toronto but this is the best ramen in Toronto by far hands down! The other options are delicious however the classic tonkotsu will be my favourite.   The broth is just right; its creaminess and rich in flavour. I've noticed many ramen places do egg noodles however this restaurant does more flour(?) based noodles which I absolutely love.  Highly recommend this place if you're around the area especially on a chilly type of day or if you're just craving japanese ramen :)"}
{"text":"Overall, worth the wait  I finally made an attempt a few weeks ago and at 2:30 pm, was still greeted with a line (albeit small). The space is tiny and cramped, the menu is short and simple. I asked the waitress for the clearest, least heavy soup...I think that got lost in translation because I was served the Tonkotsu Ramen. Having said that, the broth was tasty - rich, creamy, not too salty. The pork was absolutely delicious, especially the caramelized skin. This was probably the best pork I've had at a ramen shop to date. The full egg was a bonus, and I liked the black fungus. Unfortunately, they could only offer me their \"thick\" noodles, but to be honest they looked thin to me (but were cooked perfectly al dente). When I was done, I was hoping for more.   However, soon after I left, let me just say my tummy took a while to settle down after the richness of that meal. I don't think I'll have that particular dish again, it's just too much for my taste buds (surprisingly) but I'd love to return to try another one of their dishes."}
{"text":"Satisfying and absolutely delicious. Had the tonkotsu ramen with thin noodles and was throughly impressed with the intensity of the broth that was well balanced with the pork belly and noodles. Service was quick and efficient which made the experience alot more enjoyable. We had to queue for awhile as it was full when we arrived but it was a pretty short wait as they clear out the tables pretty quickly. Try to arrive earlier for dinner if you would like to skip the queue. Definitely recommend ramen lovers to try this place out after a day of shopping at eaton centre as it will truly make your day more fulfilling!"}
{"text":"Noodles were good. Chashu was good. Broth had some issues, there was a slight funk/stink consistent with bad tonkotsus from improperly boiling the stock that I detected immediately which ended up ruining whole bowl of ramen for me. The broth was also not as thick or rich as I would like it in a tonkatsu. Worst part is, I was with a group of 10 or so friends there and didn't want to say anything about it. Maybe it was a bad day, who knows. I'm not certain I will visit again, considering the existence of a better tonkotsu shop within 1km of my house. If the soup were comparable to the relative quality of the chashu and noodles, I'd assume this place to be rather good normally."}
{"text":"Finally tried it a couple weeks ago when the line up wasn't crazy.   Good ramen, tasty soup. Had Kirin beer, always a good thing. :)   Would go back if the line up wasn't always so ridiculous."}
{"text":"Gets your ramen fix kind of place, but nothing to get instagram excited over. Unmemorable broth and noodles, but the meat does get a honorable mention. Just doesn't taste like that true and honest delivery of flavor I look for in my ramen."}
{"text":"My first time at this location. We arrived at around 8:20pm the line had just started with us. We waited about 10 minutes, but once we got seated a lot of people started to show up. I will rate this restraunt according to service, atmosphere and food.  Service 3.5/5: the servers were nice, but they seemed a little impatient with the customers. We were asked about 3 to 4 times if we were ready to order in the time spand of prob 5min. I know the menu is limited, but still need a little bit of time to read through it. Oh and for me the portion size is very small, but its japanese serving size.   Atmosphere 3/5 : the restraunt looked nice and clean. The ambience for me was a bit on the rush and pushy side. I did not feel relaxed. I felt like when the food came we had to stop talking and start eating as fast as possible. Again this is just in my own opinion. It felt like the staff were ready to pounce on any bowls that were finished right away. When i say right away it was literally when we put down or chopsticks on the bowl haha.  Food 3.5/5 : we ordered the pork bone one, garlic pork bone one and tomato one (sorry totally forgot the names) oh also fhe fried chicken. The soup was pretty good and the texture of the noodles was good. You get to choose between thick or thin noodles. I like the thick ones better. Out of the 3 ramen i like the tomato soup base the most! The fried chicken wasnt that good a little dry.   Over all i would give this place a 3.5 star. If you are looking for a sit down with a friend or two to catch up this wouldn't be the place for it."}
{"text":"Is it just me, but i've eaten at 3 ramen places now leaving with only a half full stomach.  I think for what you pay, you get little food.  Granted it tastes good and all, but the bowls are small.  Had the Tonkotsu Black and came with 2 fatty pieces of pork .  The profit margin is large.   This place is not meant for those with large appetites!    Better ramen at Aka Oni Izi kaya on Silverstar BVLD.  At least they gave me corn and bamboo shoots to fill me up."}
{"text":"After a couple of visits, I have to say that this is probably my favourite place for ramen right now. The broth is simply amazing. I've had the tonkotsu and the shio ramen and both are done well. I drank all the broth with the tonkotsu, unlike the shio. The shio was saltier (perfect with the noodles) and I couldn't go on after I'd consumed the noodles. Despite the saltiness, I still prefer the shio over the tonkotsu. The noodles are done well, but I would love LOVE to have Kinto's noodles in Sansotei's broth."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Toronto && all the fancy food bloggers have studiously reported that a Good Toronto Tourist must get Asian food// that their Japanese food is great // and etc.. So, I find myself tipsy gabbing with my cabbie on my way over to Sansotei. BEST DECISION OF MY VISIT. The sansotei ramen, which the people sitting next to me told me to get (you sit at tables with other people--the place is small--don't be weird) was creamy and delicious and the pork belly was ohso tender and not fattychewy and the egg was the perfect amount of between soft and hard boil and it was sorta a ramen revelation. I've eaten a lot of ramen of the non-flavor packet/ microwave variety, and Sansotei was up there. Like, top three. Like, you should go and get the sansotei ramen and thank me later."}
{"text":"Overrated. Very rich broth but very greasy. Chasiu is pretty much all pork fat. Very warming for winter. But made us very thirsty afterwards."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 noodles, 3 small dishes and 2 cup of tea. Was very disappointed with the noodle. Wayyyy too salty overall, small portion with very limited ingredients in it. Small dish - seedweed salad is too overpriced, charged $5 which feels like just simply get from supermarket, and ironically this is the only dish that's not salty because it's ready made. Fried chicken is also toooo salty! Almost $50 after tips for 2 ppl, felt a bit been rip off. Will never go again."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. I have no clue what goes into these things but they taste soooo good. (I know they have an ingredient list- but I'm almost certain they're are more delicious ingredients entering my belly)  This place does get busy. It's also smaller than your local pho restaurant- but the turnover of tables seems to be equally as fast.   If you have time to go before the lunch rush (12-1) or after it, it will be easy to get a table. Also it's a hole in the wall, so you can miss it. But it's a very pretty hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I usually dislike Ramen because I feel it's too oily and greasy. However I tried the Shio and Tonkotsu Black and they were both tasty. I actually finished everything including the broth for the first time. Shio has a weaker flavor while Black has more flavors. I also ordered the tofu cheese cake. It just tasted like normal cheese cake except it had a bit more texture."}
{"text":"We went last night and despite having to wait outside for about 20 minutes, it was well worth the wait.  I ordered the spicy tantan, my companion the shoyu ramen and we split an order of gyoza.  Both were delicious in their own way.  My broth was so rich tasting with spices and pork it felt almost thick. The shoyu was much lighter but also very good.  Neither were overly salty and the flavour came from the ingredients, not salt.  My favourite part of ramen, the eggs, were cooked perfectly.  My friend, an aficionado of gyoza, declared them the best he had eaten.  If it wasn't for the wait in the cold, Sansotei Ramen would get five stars.  I'm already planning my next visit, but at a slightly off time to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I got the Tonkotsu shoyu ramen. Portions were not as big as some of the other ramen places in Toronto. The options of noodle choices were confusing - original, thin, and thick. The original and the thin noodles taste exactly the same. I would definitely try the thick noodles next time (if there is one). The broth is good but not as flavorful as Kinton's. The ambiance at Kinton is also better since you get to watch them cook the noodles."}
{"text":"Tonkatsu ramen was the way to go. The pork bone soup base was delicious: rich and warming. It was not salty at all (contrasting Santouka's broth... which was waaay too seasoned).  The ramen came with super fatty tender pork,  a nicely done soft boiled soy sauce egg, and thin ramen noodles. I felt the noodles were over cooked and lacked a 'nice' bite.  I'll try the thick noodles next time; hopefully that gives me a 'good mouth feel'... lol"}
{"text":"The last time I tried to go with a friend, they ran out of broth and posted a sign on their window (which is pretty hardcore, in my humble opinion).  I got in around 5:20pm and sat down and looked at their slim menu.  I'm a purist (as everyone who knows me is already aware) so I almost always get a tonkotsu ramen or a shio ramen.  I'm not a fan of Kenzo-style \"king of kings\" or spicy ramen with corn and stuff.  It's just not for me.  Anyway, this place caters to purists.  Your choices are tonkotsu, tonokotsu shoyu, shio, or miso ramen.  There are 3 or 4 other items.  I ordered the zangi (bits of fried chicken thighs) and the tonkotsu and it was without a doubt the best ramen I've ever had in my life.   The ramen noodles were perfectly cooked, still chewy and al dente.  The egg was divine, with a gorgeous, golden runny yolk.  They serve their ramen with fungus and a tasty piece of rolled pork shoulder.  But the broth - the broth was perfection!  Sweet, milky, creamy with all the rendered goodness of pork bones long simmered.  The pork shoulder was juicy, rich, and ever-so-slightly smoky tasting.  The balance of seasoning was on point - unlike so many other places, it wasn't too salty.  At Kinton, they thwack the extra fat on top, but I didn't notice this here, which means that the broth is less rich, but more tasty for it.  The zangi was crisp, juicy, but a bit paltry for the $4.50 price tag.  I couldn't think of a more satisfying meal on a rainy day.  I also can't wait to go back.  The flavour of that broth and the juicy, fatty pork haunt me.  I loved the chewiness of the fungus."}
{"text":"Being in the area, we've heard good things about it and decided to stop by for lunch. Even with the horrible snow storm outside the place was still pretty packed with people which has to be a testament of how good this place really is. The smells coming from the kitchen were simply awesome and had me salivating. The menu is small - like under 15 items small which is perfect. I ordered the spicey noodle option which was mild and quite happy it was since I can't handle extreme spice and heat. The food came promptly after we had ordered and inhaled the aroma coming from the bowl and it smelled as great as it tasted. I typically don't drink the broth after I finish but I wanted more noodles just so I could finish it all off. Overall I felt very content when I finished!"}
{"text":"omg yummy Japanese noodles. Although the place is small, it's such gem in the middle of the city. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I tried more than 20 Ramen places this one is the best and better than the one in Markham."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best Ramen I have ever had. The place is not very big and the menu is limited to a few choices - a sign of a good place."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen joint thus far. I never was fan of ramen until I tried Sansotei. Portions are decent, prices are average. Go for the spicy tantan if you enjoy spice as it has more flavour in my opinion."}
{"text":"Best ramen I have had in Toronto - good recommendation Marcus Y. Disappointing fried chicken though, and why don't they jam more people in? It is the asian way to dap toy haha.  I'm waiting for Raijin ramen (from the man who brought you Kintaro in Vancouver). Ramen wars!"}
{"text":"I went here back in December and the ramen and pork was amazing. The long wait in the cold was worth it. But i came back a few weeks ago and to my surprise there was no line up at all and it was during lunch time. The ramen itself was still as good as I remembered, but the pork turned out to be very dry. Perhaps it was just a bad day for them, or perhaps they got lazy and that's why they no longer have the types of line ups they used to have."}
{"text":"What a great ramen place! I got the ramen Tan tan. I really love spicy ramen, it wasn't that spicy so I was a bit disappointed. I still prefer the spicy ramen at ajisen but in general this place is another level,  well worth the wait. The pork belly appetizer is so soft and tender. It was delicious and literally melted in my mouth. We ended our meal with the Japanese dessert, it was great well. This place definitely lives up to its reputation. My advice!! Get there at 6 o'clock If you want a seat because the line up is so long."}
{"text":"Good service and good ramen ! They have a deal for any ramen and saporo for $14. Very good deal esp if you're ordering the most expensive ramen ;)"}
{"text":"Fast service once seated but salty broth! Also didn't have carry out soup containers, so only could take noodles and not broth home after my meal. Waitresses were very eager to help. Cute, tiny restaurant. Not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen! Tried three different options with my family and they were all incredible. Staff was very kind and helpful. Meals came out quickly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So my gf and I were craving for something different, and decided to try some ramen...There are sooo many out there, who knows which is good or not. The selection process is pretty simple there with only 4 choices of noodle soup. You pay extra for eggs, noodle, and pork chasu.   The place is quite small and may fit only 20 ppl at best...We were sitting at the very front like the poster child for this joint. We ordered two Tonkotsu with extra noodles (thin + thick), chasu, and eggs.   The broth is a tad salty for my gf, but its not bad. Better than instant noodle broth for sure. The noodles we preferred was the thin noodles. The chasu was quite fatty for those that enjoy that, but definitely had better chasu elsewhere like Ajisan. The egg was cooked almost fully with a bit of ooze on the inside yolk. The soup came with some black fungus and scallions.  For two people, the bill added up quickly to $30 before tips. This was an experience, and we would probably try other ramen place to find our niche."}
{"text":"NOT WORTH THE WAIT OUTSIDE IN THE COLD. Yes, the noodles are very good, but i think there are many better ramen places in Toronto. When I came, I had wait outside for 20 mins outside, and when we got inside we had to share a table as the place was very small. The price is not too expensive, but compared to other ramen places it's more expensive. Definitely not coming back"}
{"text":"Food was ok but definitely not worth waiting in line for super long. Nothing very spectacular about the food. What's funny is that they welcome you in Japanese when you walk through the door, yet they play Chinese music over the speaker... Go figure ..."}
{"text":"It's the best ramen I ever tasted all around the world! Highly recommend! Yes, probably you must wait at the line on the street ~15min to get in, but it's very ok for that what you get inside! :) Ramen+beer ~18CAD."}
{"text":"Food was great, cozy environment, staff were friendly.  Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Love when you can find decent ramen noodles that you don't feel bad paying. This was our second time at Santosei, and the service was professional and efficient as our first time (there was a huge line out!).  Had the original noodles with tonkotsu. While the meat to ramen portion isn't that great, the soup base, black fungus and egg were enough to go with the noodles. The soup base was so creamy that I finished it without knowing! It was delicious!  My friend had the spicy tam tam (only comes with thick noodles) and the soup base was to die for. If you're into spicy food, that's definitely your choice!"}
{"text":"this is my favorite ramen place in toronto, i've been to just about every other joint in town that sells ramen and it still tops my list as the best. this location is super tiny and theres pretty much a line every time i go, but luckily it doesn't take too long to get in. slurp down your bowl, as this isn't the type of place to catch up and hang out! i've had many bowls of ramen in japan so i can definitely back up sansotei as one of the best!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place, decided to take the family out for Wife's birthday on a Saturday at 5:30pm.   Pretty average. Staff was attentive and the eggs were cooked perfectly for the noodle soup.  Soup was very very salty I found.    Pricing was average.  I would not go back here due to line up.  I would only go back if in the area and no line up.  Would likely go to the burger place in same mail and try that out for a dinner outing if the opportunity arises."}
{"text":"Ordered Tonkatsu ramen. Egg was perfectly made and so was the noodles. The belly was a little salty and average quality meat.   The atmosphere is average with modern music. The noise level is on par with most ramen places so don't expect an intimate or serious conversation.  Service was fast and servers had very nice attitude."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of either ramen or udon but I have to say this place never fails to meet my expectations for a filling, perfectly cooked noodle soup. One thing you have to keep in mind before going to this restaurant is that you're expected to wait in line (outside) before you get a table inside the restaurant which is not very desirable during winter season (usually a 10-15mins wait).   Would be great if you take one or 2 friends with you since there aren't a lot of seats available.  ENJOY"}
{"text":"Other than the lineup during lunch time everything is great. Service is good and soup is amazing. Always coming to this location during the week."}
{"text":"Yum!!! My first time. Clean place, quick and pleasant service. Loved the tonkatsu black."}
{"text":"Maybe my favourite Ramen spot downtown now. This place is worth the hype!   On my first visit, I got a Tonkotsu Ramen ($9.60) and a side of Zangi ($4.50) which is basically some fried chicken. The Ramen was really good and you get a nice big serving. It came with green onion, pork belly, black fungus, and eggs (I got extra) and a bit of a creamier broth. Delicious!  The Zangi was awesome too and am glad I tried it! Super juicy with a light seasoning and batter. It's a nice portion for a side as it only comes with a few pieces (maybe 5-6).   Luckily, I arrived around 6:00 and didn't even have to wait in line to get in, but the lineup did seem to move quick. The food arrived at the table in under 5 minutes and our server was super kind! If I had one nitpick, it would be that they don't turn on the AC! lol Otherwise this place is awesome and i wouldn't hesitate to check it out!"}
{"text":"They use way too much salt for my taste... doesn't do it for me unfortunately. I really wanted to like Sansotei."}
{"text":"Arrived at 8pm on a Saturday night and the line was just past the shop front to Pet Valu. Not bad, I thought. However it was cold and it was a good 30 mins before we got in the door. Waiting got easier after that and we were seated 10 minutes later. A waitress came quickly to get our drinks order and when she returned with our drinks, she took our food order. There was no wait or need to flag down someone.   We ordered a zangi, a black tonkotsu and 2 regular tonkotsu. The zangi was alright IMO, I don't really like the seasoning but the chicken was moist and tender. One of the tonkotsu was supposed to be thick noodles but all of got thin noodles and moments after we started eating, a fourth bowl came!   I find the broth not too salty to the taste but boy, did it make me thirsty! 2 hours later and I'm still thirsty! The noodles were good, nice bite to it and the eggs perfect. The chashu wasn't too fatty but it had a lovely smoky taste to it. For dessert, we had a green tea cheesecake to share and it was perfect for us small eaters ;) The cheesecake gets a thumbs up for flavour and texture.   Wait staff is friendly and polite. They are quick to remove your bowls when you're done so they can turn the table. They don't bring you the bill they you ask for it though. I think they shouldn't wait to be asked so they can turn the table even faster, haha! Not sure if I'll return because of the wait. At 9pm there's no more line outside the shop but there's still a wait for tables."}
{"text":"Having tried a fair few of the ramen places in the area, I've developed an unhealthy addiction to Sansotei.   There are nearly always lines, even in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday, but they're not onerous.   I had the tonkotso ramen, and the first sip of broth always sends me into transports of delight.  The noodles are perfectly cooked, the tonkotsu large and flavourful, the soft-boiled eggs gel-like.   A friend who recently returned from Japan only stopped eating to say, \"I feel like I'm back in Tokyo!\" as she gobbled up her bowl of spicy tantan.  We all agree that Sansotei has the lock on ramen.  Update, 12 Feb 2014 The additions to the menu are just as good as the original selections.  I worship the rich, hearty bowl of tonkotsu ramen with thick noodles, though my friends swear by the tonkotsu black and spicy tantan versions.  To avoid lines, go in the off-hours.  Even on a bitterly cold evening there was a line of customers, willing to wait in the cold for Sansotei ramen during peak dinner hours.  Customer service is fantastic, the waiters are very observant (without being intrusive or creepy) so you hardly even have to turn your head to call them.       Given their consistency of service and food quality, I have updated my rating to five stars!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen place, hands down. And I've waited outside in the line close to 1 hour during lunch time in the freezing cold but it is well worth it. Tonkatsu Black is really the best - you can choose the noodle size as well and add and additional toppings if you'd like but personally I prefer it original noodle size and the portion is perfect just as it is. Broth is by far the best I have ever had in all ramen place and I have been to Japan and tasted amazing broths - it is just as good as some in Japan's.  The only negative thing is that this place is so damn small :( if you go around lunch time you will have to wait quite a bit."}
{"text":"The thick noodle is good here and the black garlic oil is legit. Small place though so if you come here during rush hour be prepared to wait outside in line like a clown. The deep fried chicken is good but a little bit overpriced for it. Every time we went the deep fried chicken looks like it was fried with really old oil but whatever, it's still fried chicken. The broth is on point especially with the black garlic oil"}
{"text":"The tonkutsu with garlic black oil ramen is really rice, and i really encourage you to add corn, and an extra soy egg to elevate your experience. The soy egg was perfectly cooked with a runny yolk and delicious soy-marinated egg that makes you keep going. The broth is really rich and the pork shoulder slices were well-charred and tender to bite - rich in flavour. While the ramen is delicious, the zangi or the fried chicken portion was a little lacking but made up by its crispy skin and moist chicken flesh. Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Sansotei never fails to have a line up outside their door and you can't blame them since they do have one of the best ramen in town!  Their seating is pretty limited so I would not recommend going with a large group. I ended up waiting about 15 minutes for a table of two which was fairly reasonable. I don't really like how the cold air comes in every time the door opens. It does make your dining experience a little bit less enjoyable.  Every time I visit Sansotei, I have to order their Tonkatsu Black ($9.45). It includes pork belly, black fungus, a perfectly runny egg, and garlic oil. I also added bamboo shoots for $0.75 which were just okay in comparison to other ramen shops. I love the bold flavours of their ramen and it always leaves me wanting more.   Since it is so conveniently located downtown, I'll definitely be back for more!  Atmosphere: 3/5 | Service: 4/5 | Price: 5/5"}
{"text":"Dropped by here for lunch with a friend. Got here at around 11:50am to try and beat the lunch rush hour and there was already a couple people lining up. The wait was about 10 minutes which was not too bad since it wasn't very cold outside.   We both got hot water instead of tea as they do charge for that. I got the Tokotsu Thin Ramen ($9.60) and she got the Shio ($9.50) thin Ramen. The Tokotsu was a little lit more salty then the Shio, but both were delicious overall. This remains to be one of my favourite places to grab ramen in town. Just a note, try and avoid going during busy meal times as you will have to wait outside for upwards of 30 min to an hour!"}
{"text":"Sansotei is OK, but it is no Santouka. I prefer Santouka over Sansotei as their broth isn't as well prepared and tasty in my opinion. However, it does trump Santouka in that you do not have to travel to downtown Toronto to have a good bowl of ramen. My go to ramen here is the Tonkotsu ramen. The pork is well made with the blow torch and runny egg is perfect. Maybe it is just me, I am not a fan of the black garlic. I feel that the garlic overpowers the soup and it takes away from my ramen experience. If you live in Markham, go to Sansotei ramen for the convenience and the decent noodles."}
{"text":"I've been here twice & have enjoyed their ramen!  Ramen comes with everything, pork belly, seaweed, egg, etc.  Service is good & efficient.  Only con is place is small & can get pretty crowded  when full plus long line ups during peak dining hours.  Other than that, definitely recommend to check this place out."}
{"text":"Took the subway and got there on a rainy day. The place was packed so I had to sit by the window looking out. It was pretty nice as I was a party of one. The service was fast and I ordered before I even sat down. Tonkatsu Ramen, and Gyoza! The noodle was delicious with a nice big piece of chashu meat, a bit fatty though... I would prefer more noodles but overall it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I much prefer the downtown location. I ordered the shio ramen with thick noodles and the noodles were undercooked. The broth was way too salty and it does not have the rich flavour that the downtown location has. However, the pork belly and egg were prepared nicely and the service is excellent. This place is always packed so expect to wait a minimum of 15 minutes. Also, make sure to check their hours. They are open everyday except Monday from 12-2:30 and 5-10:30 Pm."}
{"text":"Great food, definitely recommend the black tonkatsu ramen. Small place so don't expect to find a seat for 4 easily, 2 is preferable. This place and Shoryuken are best two favourites."}
{"text":"I have been to many Ramen places in Toronto, including Santouka, Kinton, Raijin, Kenzo etc.......Sansotei is still the best ramen in Toronto, best soup, best pork(cha siu), best noodle(just the THICK noodle is real ramen, the thin noodle is not egg flour ramen AT ALL), the noodle is cooked with perfect timing(not over or undercooked), they also did a great job however their side dishes are not the best, the deep fried chicken is not as juicy as Kinton while the dumpling sucks, this is the something that they should improve on!"}
{"text":"We were nuts, but waited outside for ten minutes today...it was -17. But it was worth it. The ramen was milky, a little spicy, hot and yummy.  The place is tiny, we moved from right by the door to the back of the restaurant. Good thing, or we would have been wearing our coats to eat.  We both got the tonkatsu ramen. It comes with three slices of pork belly, mushrooms, a perfectly cooked boiled egg, green onions and your choice of thick or thin noodles. The thin were chewy and perfect cooked, even up until the last bite."}
{"text":"My usual item is the tonkotsu with an extra egg. The broth is very flavorful, but it may be really heavy for some. Therefore some people don't drink the broth.  But I love their tonkotsu broth! I generally finish the whole bowl. Although the broth is very rich and filling, but it is soo tasty!  I like the shoyu ramen as well when I am feeling for something lighter."}
{"text":"Best place (along with Santouka) to get tonkotsu ramen in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I have to say the best ramen place I have ever been to. The fried chicken and spicy tantan soup are amazing. Get there early if you don't want to stand in line outside. I got there at 11:30 for lunch and was seated right away. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Ramen! Will definitely be back! I've seen this place be very very busy with long lines so definitely recommended that you come here early to get a seat! If you come after 7pm on any evening, I'm sure you'll be waiting in quite a line."}
{"text":"Seeing the snow piled roads and frozen lakes on the train back to Montreal is making me crave for a bowl of ramen at Sansotei. Not gonna lie, your ass will freeze waiting in that line if you're a rookie like me. So bundle up and bring a flask!  Zangi (aka chicken karage) - one of the best I've had in awhile  R A M E N: Broth - check! Creamy, complex and comforting Chashu - check! Just had right amounts of fat, meat and tenderness Egg - check! Love it all yolky inside Little friends - check! Bamboo shoots, black mushrooms, scallions Noodles - check! No one likes em soft and limp  If you ever get a chance to go there again, be adventurous and try the shio. It's actually better than the tonkotsu if you tend to have a more savory palate.  Haven't had flavorful ramen since Totto Ramen in NYC so this was definitely a nice treat.   Can you open one in SF and/or Montreal?!"}
{"text":"So we decided to give this place a try.  We picked a rainy day (what were we thinking?).  So we get there, find pay parking ($4 an hour) and proceeded to stand in line behind a hoard of 8 asians.  You would think that the anticipation would build up as you feel that perhaps what is worth waiting for should be really great and amazing.  So finally, after 10 minutes, a hostess comes to take our names and hands us a micro mini piece of paper.  We were freezing standing in the drizzling rain, but no matter - come hell and high water we were going to get to try these noodles.  So finally, we get seated after freezing for a good 30 minutes.  We ordered hot tea ($2 per person) and we proceed to ask for an explanation on the menu as well as any recommendations.  So the waitress recommends the Miso Ramen.  It is further explained to us that on top of the $9.50 that we are paying, it is an extra $0.50 for either fungus, bamboo shoots - the bean sprouts and corn were included for the Miso BUT not for the Ramen - the ramen includes fungus but nothing else. We had to ask her to go over the options once more while we repeated after her each time to double confirm that we understood correctly.  How complex could ordering a bowl of noodles be??   We ordered gyozas as apetizers - 4 or 5 of them came on a plate for $6 (?).  They were ok...nothing to write home about.  After a short wait, our ramen Miso bowls finally make their appearance.  The eggs were cooked to perfection - medium but still soft with some liquid....the broth however was lukewarm.  The ramen tasted ok, the corn was very fresh (the best part of the meal), the fatty pork belly was tasty, and the extra bamboo shoots were sparse and overcooked.  The broth itself tasted rich but lukewarm and without much flavor.  Is it too much to ask for hot piping broth....?!    While we were eating, we overheard the guy next to us state with authority that he always orders the Shio Ramen wherever he goes ....its apparently the way you can tell whether a place is good or not...I had no clue, I'm just an amateur, all i know is whether it tastes good, looks good, smells good, and if it leaves me satisfied/satiated, hungry, disappointed, or turned off.  The best Ramen I've ever had was for lunch in Hong Kong....it was a japanese place that my friend took me to.  Sansotei does not even come close in terms of flavor, quality, and portion size.  Overall, the experience was good. The ambiance was cozy and traditional/modern decor. Service was good.  They didn't try to cram people next to us so there was some space between us and the next set of guests. They took credit card.  The food however I felt was ok....NOT amazing as you would hope for...the broth could have been hotter and tastier...it borderlined bland, the best part was the egg and corn but they were skimpy on the other ingredients, plus there were little vegetables. As for the tea, not sure they need to charge an extra $2 when the noodles are already at a premium price. I was still somewhat hungry afterwards through i had already eaten at 4pm and then this meal at 7pm."}
{"text":"Since they've opened, I've visited and eaten at least once a month. Sometimes more. Delicious ramen. Last week I decided that maybe perhaps after an afternoon of shopping we would visit again. It was 3:50pm on a Sunday afternoon. Door was open, not locked, which was welcomed in the really cold wind that day.  A young girl yelled from the back kitchen stating they were still closed until 4pm. My husband asked if we could just sit down and wait. She said no as they were setting up and basically shoo'd us out. So me and my family walked out.  10 minutes just to sit? We wouldn't be in anyone's way. Door was open too! You are more than welcome to chill with your co-workers, set up , whatever, fine. But nothing is on your tables, floors were wiped up. Give me a break.  Really liked your ramen but that was rude. Not ever coming back. Was good while it lasted."}
{"text":"Located next to Five Guys. The sign is light grey, not very eye catching so I almost missed it as I drive around the parking lot.  Parking was easy - part of why I came here instead of going to the downtown version.   I ordered the thick noodle version with garlic oil. Broth was really good - nice rich pork flavor, a tad salty though. A full egg came with it and was perfectly soft-boiled.  Reason I took off a star was the soup temp was not hot enough. Would have been nice to have it streaming hot on a cold day. I ordered shiitake for extra 75c. They were cooked with a sweet flavor which contrasted nicely with the saltiness of the soup. Unfortunately they were cold as the kitchen forgot to put it in my order and they were brought out later. A bit annoying that the staff yells 'Welcome' in Japanese every time someone walks in - even though they are in the back of the restaurant where there is no way the patron up front could hear it - just too gimmicky imho."}
{"text":"Last time I visited this restaurant was about  1/2 year ago. Surprised to see there is a almost $1 increase across the board which I think is very unreasonable.  Since within the last  1/2 year I tried a few other ramen restaurants which relatively offering better food but charging at a lower price point. That's why I lowered the star rating for the food they offered at that price. Besides they made me sharing a table with a total stranger without asking me whether it is ok (Japanese food culture?)"}
{"text":"A new ramen restaurant. Lack of ramen stock atmosphere. Ramen shop should have a very rich ramen stock atmosphere. I tried the shoyu. Then I know that their ramen failed in soup stock. I recommend their chef should learm how to have a good ramen stock. I like this shop because they serve beer, the new kurunama.  Eggs are good."}
{"text":"This was rated the top ramen spot in Toronto on blogto.com and though it was the only ramen joint I patronized while visiting it made the fine dining I had on business the previous evening seem mundane.  This was a delicious bowl of Tonkotsu black ramen and tops my past ramen experiences.  Come here for a great culinary experience."}
{"text":"The portion size is a joke, not even close to filling. I ordered thin noodles and it was too tough even after letting it soak for a few minutes. I don't know how anyone could chew through the thick noodles. The broth & meat was good but not worth the $10 per bowl.   Really disappointing and would not be coming back, it's just another over hyped restaurant chain."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 items: Tonkotsu with thin ramen ($9.60), Tobkotsu Black with thin ramen, and Zangi (deep fried chicken) ($4.50);  The fried chicken was moist and tasty. Well cooked, but not many pieces (I'd say around 5-6 bite sized pieces) in the order. For 2 people, it's definitely not enough (2.8/5)  For ramen, I suggest the thin noodle! I had the regular Tonkotsu (3.8/5) and wife had the Black (4/5) version. I think the difference is with the sesame oil? But I preferred the black bc it was tastier. The broth was hearty and the pork was delicious."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for ramen when I am in the area. It is delicious and the service is great.   The miso is my absolute fave!"}
{"text":"Would come again. Soup was a bit on the salty side, but that's because I am reducing my salt intake."}
{"text":"We tried the spicy tan tan, black miso, and black tonkotsu (their three most popular ramen soup bases). We all liked the black miso soup base the most. Recommend going thick noodle (instead of thin) for all of them -- thick is a bit of a misnomer as it's probably the thickness of the traditional ramen noodles you're already familiar with."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, never had such good ramen. Love the garlic oil flavour. Service was quick and good. Lots of people, if you're coming in a big group you'll probably have to wait a bit because the place is small"}
{"text":"I want some more!  _______________________________________________________________  Scanty on the meat and other toppings, but the flavour is deliciously salty and fatty/rich - buahaha.  _______________________________________________________________  Not as salty as Kinton ramen!"}
{"text":"Its pretty sad, just opened and they already have to receive this kind of rating.. 20min wait, expected amazing food, id rather eat at ajisan and that plce is pretty bad. The ramen was way too salty. Got the spicy tantan My waitress can't even speak english, i don't have a clue what shes saying to me. Absolute garbage.."}
{"text":"The tonkotsu broth was amazing and very likely the best in the city. They said it takes them 5-6 hours to make and they regularly run out each night (on this particular Wednesday night they sold out by 8:30pm).  I actually prefer the noodles at Kinton. Although I am more of a noodle person, the broth more than makes up for it, and Sansotein is now my new go-to place for ramen.  They gyoza was mediocre and a bit burnt which is the only reason why this is not a 5-star review."}
{"text":"Cost: reasonable Quality: good - 95% for ramen Decor: average - 75% tight like the one at Dundas location Staff: average service - 85% Value: good - 85%  Keeper? Yes this location and the Dundas Sansotei are two of the best in Toronto"}
{"text":"Just like the ones downtown, except this one has more space. Same good quality food, service too, very consistent, can't complain."}
{"text":"Fast service, kind waitresses. My favourite is spicy tantan, always a bit sad when they don't have any left. Try not to come an hour or two before closing, otherwise it will likely be sold out.  Second best is tonkatsu black, however not everyone is a fan of the garlic oil on top.   overall good experience, gyoza was a little pricey for the quantity. The zangi and gyudon are bomb!"}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had so far in Toronto! Everything was great, the staff was polite, the food was delicious and the service was fast. I like that the soup was not too salty. Both my bf and I enjoyed it very much. Would definitely go again and again!"}
{"text":"I had being looking forward to go here for a week. After the work out, I was starving, so I hit the place. There were a lot of people. I waited outside for like five minutes and was arranged to sit in the middle of a table later. Not really a comfortable spot but I am alone. I ordered the pork belly black ramen with thin noodles and Dafu. The service was good. And the serving speed was pretty quick. The ration was kind of small. Only two pieces pork belly. The noodle was excellent, I mean perfect.  The soup was good, but too salty for me. I did not finish it which is not really good for eating ramen. The pork belly was amazing. I ate it after I almost finished the noodle. The pork was soaked with soup and tasted like heaven. At first, I came for the Matcha Dafu. But it was a black one and a yellow one. The black one was like Mocha. The inner tasted more like cheesecake which was great. But the yellow one was disappointing. I can't figure out what flavor it is. The washroom condition isn't really good. Overall a good place. Like to try the green tea cheesecake next time."}
{"text":"This is a great ramen place! I came here when visiting Toronto recently. I have lived and eaten in NYC and think the quality is comparable! It was delicious!  We went for a very late lunch and were seated immediately. Our waitress was very friendly and polite. The place is tiny, but tables can seat parties up to 6.   I ordered the tonkotsu, my friend had the spicy tantan, and we had a chasu-don to share.   The tonkotsu broth was rich and savory. The pork belly was delicious and charred just the right amount. I had gotten the original noodles which were served slightly al dente without being hard.  My friend enjoyed his spicy tantan with thick noodles just a much. It was spicy without being overpowering.   The chasu-don was good, excellent pork and a soft boil egg over rice, but next time I would probably just get extra chasu for my noodle dish.   The price was very reasonable and I would even say cheap for a ramen place of such great quality. Each bowl of noodles was about 9 dollars and the chasu-don which could have been a meal in itself was about 6.  I would definitely come back again when I am next in Toronto!"}
{"text":"My visit was a while back so I can't remember exactly what I ordered. I remember getting ramen and a side dish of fried chicken and both were very good. So far, I think this is best ramen that I've had in Toronto. It was just that good AND it was pretty reasonably price IMO.   I'll definitely come here again if I'm in the area. No comments on service (nothing memorable), but I come for the food anyway.   The only negative is the place is a bit small and crowded so this is not a place for hanging out. There will be a line waiting and you'll feel bad if you don't leave soon after your meal. I wouldn't be surprised if the waiters rush the customers to leave as well but my group didn't wait for that to happen."}
{"text":"Tastes just as good as the downtown location, and with much more seating! Arrived at 6:30 and only waited about 5 min for 3 people as bar seating was only available to smaller groups. We found it quite spacious (didn't feel cramped at all), and also didn't have to share a table w others. We had the tonkatsu black & the tomato ramen; both were fantastic. Had attentive service all dinner, would return again."}
{"text":"Tonkotsu with original size noodles. Pretty good ramen, though I wish they had some chili to put in it on the table. They were also out of kirin beer ; ("}
{"text":"I love Sansotei - the one in downtown toronto  that is. so when I saw that one opened in Markham, it was first choice for Sunday lunch. the shop unit is much larger than the one in Toronto and certainly more child friendly. We had the spicy Dan Dan noodles and te tomato scallop.  2 stars for the taste and portion, when compared with downtown. i felt that the shop stinged on the charsu, it was small and unfulfilling. the taste of the pork was delish..smoky and porky. as for the dandan soup, it lacked the finishing touches the downtown store had (fragrant red herb that looked like saffron). The tomato scallop noodles tasted like some variation of Tom yum, but minus the heat.   in summary, not coming back for a long while but will give it another chance."}
{"text":"Great ramen! The broth is amazing, the beef tender, and the noodles cooked very well. I believe I had the miso broth ramen and it was very good! I have tried others and it stands out for me. I definitely recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've ever had, hands down.  I had the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and my girlfriend had the Tonkotsu Ramen. After trying both, I immediately regretted ordering the Tonkotsu Shoyu. This isn't to say that the Tonkotsu Shoyu was bad, far from it. The Tonkotsu Ramen just tasted that much better. Get it.  If you're new to the growing ramen scene in the GTA, Sansotei Ramen should be at the top of your list."}
{"text":"Best Ramen I'm Toronto. The broth was tasty, the pork was tender, the half boiled egg was cooked perfectly. The restaurant is a little small, which equates to line-ups but it is well worth the wait. This place is the one and only place to have the best bowl of ramen Toronto has to offer."}
{"text":"we ate here 11/24/12  authentic ramen. flavorful broth, warm, comforting. some meat, some veggies, some perfectly cooked noodles. nothing fancy. eaten from a steaming bowl with chopsticks and an asian soup spoon.  simple.  but so good.  if done properly.  tiffany and i were craving for ramen, as there aren't many (actually i don't even think there are any) options in cleveland. and we're pretty sure we'd find some good choices in toronto.  sansotei ramen came highly recommended in forums and by different people. and so we gave it a shot.  i don't know if we were close to a school, i know the university of toronto is within 2 to 3 miles from the place, if not closer, but the place was packed. fortunately we got a seat close to the end. no need for a high chair. i just had lauren sit on my lap.  what we had  though we were fine with ordering 2 ramens, we wanted to try out some japanese appetizers. we were eating at a place for the first time, and probably the last time in a while since we're not from toronto.  we might as well order a bunch of stuff.  so we also ordered some gyoza and fried chicken to start before proceeding with ramen.  gyoza. ($4.50)  the gyoza was okay. nothing extraordinary. maybe a tad underseasoned. and we wished there was a little bit of crisp to the gyoza wrap. but hey, this is a ramen place, so we knew the gyoza was not the star.  (6/10)  zangi. ($4.50). deep fried chicken.   the japanese fried chicken was pretty good. i don't want to pretend that i know what unique spices there are in japanese fried chicken. i think the breading is different, panko breadcrumbs perhaps instead of the usual flour mix or batter? i just know that it was good.  they used the leg, and chopped it to bite sized pieces. they were very crispy, and since the leg was used, the meat was very tender.  so this gets high marks. if anything, maybe a bit more salt? but, you know what, for crispness of the skin and the tenderness of the meat, this was pretty good.  (8/10).  tonkotsu ramen. ($9.25).  tonkotsu ramen. broth made from hours of simmering with pork bones, fat and collagen, and perfectly al dente noodles, and the right pairing of traditional accompaniments such as the boiled egg, was perfect. there was a bite to the noodles that we immediately noticed. it wasn't overcooked. it certainly did not lay inside a big pot for eventual scooping for the hundredth customer. the noodles were probably cooked to order, assuring proper texture, bite, and chewiness for each customer. we loved it. this was excellent.  (9.5/10).  miso ramen. ($9.50).  the miso ramen was just as good. still a very flavorful broth, with just the right amount of saltiness, and miso. the menu suggested having the thicker ramen noodles for this, and like the tonkotsu ramen, the noodles here were again perfect. i know ramen is ramen, but tiffany and i immediately noticed the texture of the noodles. i guess if it's really done properly, it will pop out at you, because that's exactly what both of us thought as we bit through the noodles. the texture and firmness popped.  it was perfectly cooked once again, with that chewy resistance that's rare in a properly made, freshly prepared, asian noodle dish, not just ramen.  i have yet to delve into the condiments. the egg, the pork belly, the scallions, were all good, complementary. but as i have described in my previous post in banh mi boys, i tend to get wowed by the basics of a dish. the rice for sushi, the bread for sandwiches, the broth and noodles for noodle soups. The noodles and the broth for their ramen, how there were cooked, their feel, temperature, texture, and of course taste, were perfect.  (9.5/10).  take.  i don't know when we'll be back in toronto. maybe when the weather is nice, at some random spring, summer or fall weekend, we may drop by again. we're from cleveland, and distance-wise, toronto is much closer to drive than chicago, dc, or new york city. and we go to those cities several times a year.  for a family that loves asian food, we're sure to be back. and we'll be back at sansotei ramen. maybe at an earlier time. maybe at an off hour. maybe to try other ramens on the menu. but this place is a must. and we highly recommend it to anyone living in, or visiting toronto.

{"text":"Sansotei Ramen has recently opened their new location in Richmond Hill, inside a small plaza on Yonge north of Sixteen Avenue. We ordered the Miso Black (miso soup based top with roasted garlic oil) which features their new soft tender slow cooked pork with a hint of heat. The soup was not overly salty and the roasted garlic oil added another level of flavoursto the soup however we didn't taste the miso flavour and the temperature was not hot enough. The ramen noodle has the right firm texture. It also comes with a piece of house made chasu, a perfectly cooked whole soft boiled egg, baby shiitake mushroom which we liked it very much. It has a balance of sweet, sour and soy sauce taste."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  I think I came on a bad day. When I was seated I was told there wasn't enough hot water for the soup so it would be a 30 minute wait before we got ramen. I didn't understand what it meant to run out of hot water. Does that mean the soup is cooked in 30 minutes? I don't really know.  The bad part is you can tell everything waited for the soup. All the toppings were cold. I had the tonkotsu and the pork was grilled, which is different and nice. The pork was cold. Probably cooked before hand. I just pushed it under the soup and brought it out and it was fine. The same goes for the cold eggs. The flavorless noodles had flavor when I stirred it a bit in the soup. I liked the soft texture of the noodles. Soup was flavorless. The woodear mushroom was nothing special. It wasn't cut up and I do prefer it in strips."}
{"text":"I've been to Aji Sen and thought the noodles were okay. Not great, but okay.  I've been to Kenzo and passed on the ramen, but ordered the yakisoba. Good stuff, but relatively overpriced (especially for the sides). Also, it's not ramen.  I've been too Kinton as well and was sorely disappointed by the hype. Long wait times + hard, unappetizing noodles = no return.  So I can't say I've had the best impression of ramen, but then I heard about this place. A friend of mine wanted to come here, and although my ramen experiences weren't as amazing as everyone else makes them out to be, I thought I'd give it a try.  Needless to say, my expectations coming here weren't high. Upon arriving, I wasn't overly pleased either.   Although the wait time was nowhere near as bad as Kinton was (waited to be seated for an hour), there was still a lineup. It wasn't very well organized. When you walk into the restaurant (which is quite tiny by the way), one of the waitresses will ask you to wait outside in a line. They don't even bother to take your name down to put you on a list. But on the bright side, they're pretty nice about it.  So strike one there, but that's where the strike ends.  Service was fast, the waitresses/waiter was nice, and the ramen was tasty. Good ramen! Who would've thought?   The way this place makes the ramen resembles spaghetti. I thought it was upon first glance, but eating it, there was definitely a difference. It wasn't hard like Kinton, but t wasn't soft to the point of being mushy either. Very nice for slurping and making a mess in front of your friends.  The soup was very good too. I've been trained to never drink soup when eating noodles because it could be loaded with MSG. I'm sure noodle houses have healthier soups, but I've never really had any before that was good enough for me to consider dropping my guard over until I had Tonkotsu Ramen here. The soup looked pearly white, but the taste was delicious. Not too salty; not scathingly hot; not bad at all!  It's the first time I've finished a noodle soup.   Although I'd like to give this place 5 stars, the whole lining up thing didn't appeal to me. Also, when we left, I saw that they had posted up a sign saying they were sold out. I have no idea if they were out of soup or noodle, but that can't be good for anyone who ends up waiting in line outside, only to be turned away because the restaurant had insufficient stock of food available.   But that shouldn't deter you from giving this place a try. It's good, and if you like Japanese food or noodles, you'll want to stop by this place at least once."}
{"text":"Prepare to wait in line for at least 30-40 minutes. Overall medicore experience, had better ramen downtown."}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen.   When asked about the best ramen in Toronto, my answer is always either Sansotei or Santouka. They're both great, but while Santouka has a more extensive menu (and hard-to-find items like pork jowl), I find the broth at Sansotei more subtle, and a little more managable in terms of grease and salt.  My go-to at Sansotei is the tonkotsu black. The broth -- already rich and creamy on its own, with an intense drizzle of black garlic oil -- is absolutely stunning. Then they throw on thinly-sliced wood-ear mushroom, a perfectly soft-boiled (with runny yolk) egg, green onions, and fatty pork belly -- the perfect accompaniments.   If I had to be picky, I'd say the noodles (I normally order \"original\") can sometimes get a little limp and lose their texture. But the restaurant offers varying noodle thickness - thin, original and thick - so it's not a problem that a little experimentation wouldn't take care of.  Small tip? Lineups tend to form early for both lunch and dinner, so if you really want ramen, I advise going solo to skip the lines. This is what I do, and I never have to wait."}
{"text":"I ordered tonkotsu black ramen it was delicious. However I found the broth a tad bit on salty side. Otherwise the meat, egg were on par. The service was quick and efficient. Be prepared to share tables."}
{"text":"What can I say about this heavenly ramen house... first off, when I went here for the first time and tried their tonkatsu ramen, I died. Ever since they added the Markham location, I've been at least once every 2 weeks (which reminds me, another visit is due).  Menu: Sansotei has a small simple menu. This is great because it allows them to excel at what they do best. They have the usual shoyu and shio ramen but they're known for their Tonkatsu ramen. To add icing to the cake they have a variation of the Tokatsu called the Tonkotsu Black. This is where my heart lies. They also have a spicy ramen called the Spicy Tan Tan for those spicy lovers - though it is limited quantity per day so try to get there a little earlier. You can choose the style of noodles as well (think or thick) and add extra or other toppings on top for a cost. They also have pretty good appetizers/sides and dessert (though I haven't tried those yet).  Ramen: Two words - Tonkatsu Black! Their pork broth with that heavenly roasted black garlic oil is perfection in itself. If you like garlic definitely try this ramen, you won't regret it. The broth is creamy but not heavy and the oil is delicious without tasting like a pool of oil. It comes topped with 2 pieces of grilled pork belly, fungus, green onion and a soft boiled soy sauce egg cut in half. The egg is cooked to perfection with the middle still a little runny but not so much that it falls right out of the egg white. The pork is okay. Not as good as some other places but good. My favourite topping to add is the shitake mushrooms. You must try them. They're soaked in a soy sauce mix which the mushrooms absorb so you get a great burst of sweet and salty flavour when you eat them.   The Shio and Shoyu are good in their own right but can not compare with the Tonkatsu. The spicy tan tan is a good balance of rich creamy broth and a spice that can be quite hot but doesn't linger on the tongue. At first I didn't really like the taste but I kept eating and with every bite, I grew to like it more and more.  Sides: I've tried their gyoza (pan fried dumplings), cha han (fried rice) and zangi (deep-fried chicken bites) as sides but I have to give the trophy to the zangi. It is perfectly cooked and always juicy. There is just enough batter to give it the crunch it needs. Top it off with the lemon for a nice zest and to cut the grease (not that they're super greasy at all).  Overall, I am in love with this ramen house. Though it doesn't have a large variety, you don't need it when you come here. Just get the Tonkatsu black!"}
{"text":"I have a feeling that this will become a regular habit for me and some other work pals -- we will be running here as the 5PM gong sounds because otherwise, you will be cooling (literally) your jets on the sidewalk getting slushed by rabid taxis while you wait for a table. The three of us cleaned out three bowls of ramen (miso and tonkatsu, regular noodles) and some super-salty edamame as fast as everything could be brought to the table.  Can I say anything bad about the tonkatsu soup I ordered? No, I can't. It's full, meaty, salty, and just the right heat-- no burning off your mouth with the first bite and being unable to taste the rest. The noodles were the perfect texture, a bit firm to the bite, balancing off the tenderness of the pork belly and crunchy wood ear mushrooms. The green onions were a bit of a kick (as were the little nuggets of garlic surprise in the soup). Awesome. Just awesome. One of our party was feeling sick earlier in the day; I can't vouch for ramen as a miracle cure or anything, but he was definitely less sniffly when we left. The service wasn't the promptest or most attentive, but having grown up in Chinese cafeteria-style cafes, I am incredibly forgiving. The decor is simple and they don't cram you in.  This place is for the socialist at heart. Everyone is happy with the bowl they get, nobody jumped the line, nobody is treated specially, and they don't always have every noodle in stock. I'll definitely be back, work comrades in tow."}
{"text":"Overrated.  It is not bad, but nothing special about it.  I prefer kinton over sansotei.  I have yet to try santouka."}
{"text":"When it starts to get colder, I tend to crave tonkotsu ramen. I'm on the hunt for the best tonkotsu ramen and for now this is the best I've had in Toronto.  I went before it got really busy, back in September. There was still an hour wait, but when I walk by it now it seems even longer. The decor is really nice, but the layout could do with some changes to add more seating and use the extremely small space more efficiently.  The soup-base was really flavourful, a tad bit too salty, but the pork was soft and delicious. The noodles could have been cooked a little longer and it was obvious that the soup-base wasn't made from scratch, it was a bit powdery.   It was still delicious and the service was really good. I liked that the tonkotsu ramen came with vegetables and an egg for 9.25, which is a great value. Definitely, my favourite ramen place in Toronto."}
{"text":"I personally really enjoy Sansotei's take on ramen and have enjoyed my experiences at this location just as much as the original downtown Toronto location.   My go-to orders: Spicy tan tan ramen - I love spicy noodle soups. I'm not a fan of the cha siu that normally comes with ramen so I like that this one comes with minced pork instead.  Tonkatsu black - I love the kick from the garlic, although I can see why some people would find it overpowering  The soft boiled eggs are always prepared perfectly and marinated well. Overall, best ramen in Markham."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for early dinner  with my kids.  Place was a quarter full and seated promptly. Staff was courteous and our order was taken right away.    We had the tonkotsu and miso black with thick noodles and a side order of fried chicken.  Kids enjoyed their ramen and I was ok with the black miso.  Only thing was the burnt garlic flavor I tasted in the broth.  Pork belly was very tender and eggs were perfect. The fried chicken was delicious for it was hot and crispy. The portion however for $4.50 was unacceptable.  Kids love ramen more than myself. . Average place.  Should have had the burger from 5 guys which was beside this location lol.  As long as the kids are happy... 3 stars"}
{"text":"Worst ramen ever. This is a franchise restaurant and the ramen does not taste the same as the one at downtown. We ordered spicy tantan and miso black. Both of the broth is not hot enough. And the pork belly has a weird taste. Never again."}
{"text":"This is a solid 2. The service was very good, the food was not even mediocre. The tonkotsu ramen lacked flavour, 2 thin slices of meat were there as if it's garnish. The egg was properly done medium which was nice. The main ingredient was the noodles. You can't charge 10 bucks for noodles, especially when they themselves aren't properly seasoned when cooked. I asked them to give me half the noodles, they said they can't do this. What a load, the noodles are precooked. Never again."}
{"text":"I believe this is their 3rd restaurant in GTA. I usually go to their restaurant near Yonge\Finch station which is quite small. It is nice they have a new restaurant in Richmond Hill. The restaurant is spacious with plenty of seats. Staff are very friendly and fast service. The food is great! Spicy Tantan and Black Miso are my favourite."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars, not the best ramen ever, but not bad. Had the tonkasu ramen, Noodles were not soggy and broth was ok flavored. Serving is small for the price, but you can add extra noodles for a couple of bucks more."}
{"text":"I would actually give this place a 3.5. The Tonkatsu ramen had a good soup base, but I was not particularly fond with the noodles. I To be honest, I was disappointed with the fried chicken appetizer (small in size too). The fried rice appetizer was yummy. Overall, not my favourite ramen place in Toronto, but  I'd come back."}
{"text":"What does Sansotei mean?  I think it must mean EXCELLENT!  Went in and had no wait at all.  The ramen was chewy and delicious.  Soup was rich and yet not too greasy (a big complaint I have with many ramen houses I've been to).  Egg was well cooked, but I like my eggs a shmidge runnier.  The fried chicken is a MUST ORDER.  Fantastic little nuggets of crispy fried chicken add a nice texture to your meal.  To finish, we ordered the mochi--sadly, I can't say this was a 4 star dessert.  The green tea mochi had a whipped cream center, and the chocolate one had a center that was like a frozen cheesecake inside.  Not exactly what we were expecting.  But everything else makes up for it."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend around dinner time and waited for about 15 minutes before we got a seat on the inside. I know some people hate waiting for any period of time and this is usually the case for a person like myself however, the quality of the ramen was totally worth it.   We both got the tonkotsu ramen, which was very milky, mild but also had a punch to it, in my opinion this is probably the place with the best tonkotsu ramen in TO. The eggs were delicious, they were not over cooked, the yolks were soft and still a bit milky, which is the best for ramen. The chashu was amazing, it was soft and tender and probably the best I've had in a while.  I've never had anything except the tonkotsu here but I'm willing to try other things from Sansotei in the future!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sansotei for three times. Every time I order tonkusu ramen. Compared to momofuku, it's not that greasy. Compared to Kinton, not much add-ins inside.  But I do like the service in Sansotei!"}
{"text":"Location: Located off Yonge St in Toronto, there is paid Green P parking on nearby residential streets at $2.50/hour (free after 9pm).  Facility: Small with modern decor. Not much to comment on that you can't see in photos. Washrooms are average/typical of an Asian restaurant.  Food Quality & Price: It was good, but not great. I enjoyed the ramen but the portions were TINY. We were still very hungry after our dish ($9 each). I am also petite with a relatively small appetite, so I was very surprised that I was not even satisfied with how much was in my bowl.   I had the Tonkatshu Dark with Thick noodles and it was satisfactory. The good things about it were that the broth tasted decent and I was impressed that they had black fungus/mushroom in the dish. BUT, I couldn't help but be disappointed overall. The \"thick\" noodles were not all that thick and the egg was cold in the middle. But the worst part was the portions. You want more food, you're going to have to pay more. We ended up NOT doing that and heading to a pub after for more food (see review on W Burger Bar).  Service: Was nice. We were greeted with a smile at the door. Our hostess let us know (without me having to ask) how long the wait was - about 5 minutes on a Saturday night around 7pm. We were seated quickly and served quickly. The food arrived quickly as did the bill... seriously, we were in and out under 30 minutes. Everything was efficient. I can't believe that I have to say this as kind of a negative, as I find efficiency in service crucial, but we DID feel a bit rushed (as more people arrived for dinner service). It definitely felt like an in-and-out factory line. You come, sit, eat, pay, leave. I am assuming this would be perfect for lunch when people have to get back to work.  Overall: Sansotei is a decent place to get ramen. It's definitely NOT the best, but it is not bad. I would say that I was \"satisfied\" overall but would not say I was impressed. For the reputation of being part of the Big 3, I don't think it earns it's stripes. The portion was the biggest problem. Again, we ended up going straight to a bar down the street for more food (we are both under 120lbs each and don't eat a lot, so this was a big concern). Would I return? I would probably end up coming back a few times, but I wouldn't call myself a dedicated or faithful repeat customer."}
{"text":"Location: Located in the Whole Foods plaza next to the Pet Valu. Ample parking.  Facility: The establishment is small but was very crowded during dinner hours. Wait was about 20 - 30 minutes. Washroom was ok but they were stingy with soap. It was refilled to the point where it was basically water. Asked them to refill the soap and it was never done during my time there. Kind of gross if employees are using the same washroom and handing our food.  Food Quality & Price: I had the Tonkatsu Black with thick noodles and it was satisfactory. Portion wise, it was more than the downtown location and I was definitely full. Selections of toppings were great with black fungus but only two pieces of pork belly. Broth was only okay, salty with possible MSG, for sure not a low simmer with pork bone. Egg was not marinated enough, was almost a regular soft boiled that melted into the soup.  Service: Hostess and wait staff were all friendly and fast. However, again when I asked for the soap to be refilled, that was never done.   Overall: Sansotei still, in my opinion, doesn't live up to its hype. Don't think I'll be returning as long as Kinton or Jyuban is in the area. Sansotei needs to step up their egg and broth game."}
{"text":"We had a book club here. There was a long line with a lot of people waiting. They could not sit us all down unless most of us were here. We might have had to sit with strangers.  My main experience with Ramen is Sonoya at First Markham and this place was good but that place was better. There is a restaurant chain feel to the experience.  Everyone with me (6 others) seemed to like the food enough but I do not think it is worth lining up for. You can get the same quality (which was quite good) at a lot of places.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The soup contains too much oil. And I do not know if a bowl of ramen without sea sedge could be called ramen... So I am a little disappointed about this so-called No.1 ramen store in Toronto.  ( *` )   Why is it still too short?!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars  The location of the restaurant is great with lots of parking.  I heard this place always has a line up but I was lucky to get a seat immediately at lunch hour.  The service was friendly and fast.  Seating is spacious but the washroom really needs better lighting.   I have ordered the Tonkotsu Black Ramen with the garlic oil.   The thick noodles were al-dente but the broth was just ok.  It was lacking the expected aroma and complexity.  I was expecting the black garlic oil to add another layer of flavour but instead it seems to have increased the bitterness of the broth.   I was quite disappointed as I had high expectations for Sansotei.  With this price point, I probably have better choices for Ramen."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere! Servers are a bit young and need some customer service training. Menu is decent but needs more choices as there are only six main dishes available. Hoping to see the menu expand in the future."}
{"text":"I ordered the miso ramen. All ramen orders already include egg, bamboo shoots, black fungus and corn. The pork belly was moist. My soup was not too salty, the tonkatsu was saltier, but both broths are lighter than Kintons (on Baldwin st). Tea is $2.  We were a table of 6 and waited about 20 mins for a table on a weekday rainy night. This place tops my list for ramen, Definitely would line up again =)   Decor is sailor themed and cozy."}
{"text":"Went there this afternoon. It is average ramen at best. I would say 2 and half star. The deep fried chicken side order makes give less than 3 star. At least, it is not 1 star that I gave to the last ramen noodle place."}
{"text":"overall this is a great ramen place, especially if there is no wait. I would say their strongest item is their pork - I find that most other places, the pork belly (even with the fat) is dry (even at santouka or kinton etc.) but the pork here is pretty much perfect.  Noodles are decent quality as is the broth (but not my favourite of the 'big' ramen places that are popular in Toronto right now)  But definitely the best pork in Toronto (for now)"}
{"text":"In my constant pursuit of the perfect ramen in Toronto, I think I have finally found the place. It's Sansotei Ramen in downtown area. I ordered Tonkotsu (pork bone broth) Ramen and I was totally impressed. The eggs, the noodles, the pork, and the broth works together like an orchestra in a bowl. No one ingredient tries to impress you by overpowering another. They work together in a beautiful combination. The noodle is not the typical chewy ramen but a more Chinese like noodle. It tastes more like real noodles than instant noodles. Also, consider the origin of Ramen (ref Wiki) and how it is made, the noodles in Sansotei may well be the most authentic ones.  Next, the pork. I once had cha siu in Japan and it literally melted in my mouth. The cha siu in Santoei is very close to that experience. It's fat, for sure. And a bit salty. But you are offered only two precious slices of them. So, forget about any health recommendation, indulge yourself in them before they disappear.  The broth is rich but not super rich. I could drink the whole bowl without feeling sick.  Finally, the service is good. The server doesn't speak English very well but that, you may argue, adds to the authenticity of the restaurant.  So, stop reading and go there at once. There are reasons why there's already line up at 11:50am. The only thing you need to worry about is getting a seat."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous time and it's one of my favourite spots for ramen. I always get the spicy ramen with the thick noodles. I'm a big eater so I tend to get extra noodles if I can.  Their gyozas are also really good to grab on the side as well if you can eat it all."}
{"text":"I've came here a couple of times with my friends whenever we're in downtown Toronto. There's always a line up outside during lunch hour - and for very good reason. I can only name good things about this place; the service, food, decor. The ramen is the best I've tasted against other competing ramen restaurants. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Well, although the food was good, there was nothing about my experience that bested Kinton.   The atmosphere at Kinton is much more lively and reminiscent of Japan, the washrooms were nowhere near as nice, clean or spacious as Kinton.   The noodles were overcooked as were the eggs. To be fair tonkatsu is not my preferred flavour of broth, so it doesn't stack up at all against the spicy garlic bowl at Kinton. The gyoza was limp and soggy and the sauce was weak w no zing. The Cha-Han (fried rice) was well done, but I've made better myself.   It is also obvious that Kinton runs a much tighter ship. Although it was not overly busy, I can understand the complaints of other yelpers about queue management and seat organization based on what I saw while eating.   Kinton & Santouka will be where I spend my ramen time and money."}
{"text":"I thought my first ramen experience at Kenzo was amazing, but I was naive back then.   My first experience at Sansotei, I ordered the Tonkotsu with original noodles. I'll get straight to the point. That little bowl of soup was the most amazing thing I've ever tasted in a long time. It was a bowl of happiness and love, and all I could do was smile and laugh because it was so damn good!   I'm from Halifax, so our ramen selection is very limited. I tried to have lunch there before flying home but the line was outside... in the cold... but mainly because I was being squeezed for time and on the verge of being late for my flight... which ended up delayed for another 2 hours anyway due to the ice storm."}
{"text":"I like it ;) When you try this ramen is first time,  I recommend standard Tonkotsu ramen is best. But I like spicy Tonkotsu ramen too."}
{"text":"I was forced by my honey to come to this place again, noodle are still very salty, but staff are friendly and she bought me a big bowl of soup to adjust the saltiness. My husband loves the noodle, not me lol. 5 star for service 3 star for food 8/2= 4stars"}
{"text":"Dropped by Tuesday night around 7pm. The place was full but I only had to wait about 5 mins to be seated.   Convenient location (right near the new Whole Foods store on hwy. 7/Birchmount). Decor, surprisingly, was modern Japanese Izakaya. With wood trim & the vaulted ceiling hidden by traditional thick twisted rope.   Service was brisk, and our order came out in under 10 mins. I had the Tonkotsu Black, & my date had the Shoyu ramen.  Overall excellent. (Tonkotsu) may have been slightly on the salty side for some palates. The Shoyu was spot on.   Overall one of the better Ramen Houses in Markham. Will definitely be going back.   CON: table configuration was odd. With most tables able to sit 6-8 ppl, couples were being seated on opposite ends of the same table. Not as private as some would like."}
{"text":"Definitely a step down from the downtown locations. The line up was not bad, but the way they manage the seating is definitely not the best.  I ordered a Tonkatsu Black with thick noodles, bur they got my noodles all wrong :/"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait at least 20 mins. It's always busy no matter what time you go.   Service is great; everyone is polite, patient, and good at what they do.   Food is great; I had the Tonkatsu Black, and it was flavourful and delicious.   Wifi password is uptownmarket."}
{"text":"This is the most over hyped and over rated ramen I've ever tasted. Both of the ramens we ordered had very few ingredients and fatty pork cuts. I don't like to eat fat and pay $10 for it. If you want to eat pork fat you will love this place."}
{"text":"I'll have to say it's one of the best of its kind......so far! Both quality and price wise, at least they don't charge you for that egg which to me is one very flavorful ingredient that is meant to be in a ramen!"}
{"text":"Very authentic! It was my first time there. I ordered spicy tantan, and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Have visited this place a few times for lunch and have always enjoyed their food. The Ramen is really flavorful and well priced. Next time I'm going I'll have to try the fried chicken (Zangi) as I'm always envious when I see someone beside me get served a bowl of it.  I would highly recommend the Tonkotsu Black Ramen with added mushrooms, very rich and addictive."}
{"text":"Another ramen place in downtown Toronto. There is nothing wrong with friendly competition! Small menu. Food is pretty good. The place is pretty small but very friendly service."}
{"text":"After recommendation from the Yelpers, I got a chance to try out this restaurant.  Be prepared to wait not inside the store but standing outside cold on the street.  I got a number waiting to be called.  The menu is posted on the window with no English explanation.  With the help of reading the Yelper's reviews in advance, I am able to know which one I like.  The soup is milky pork bone broth.  There are 2 halves of running liquid yolk boiled to its perfection, chopped onions, 2 pieces of pork belly and the black fungus ().  You have to consume the soup while eating the ramen.  The ramen is chewy and has a very good texture.    It is recommended to have a cup of tea to go with the soup as it is so concentrated.  The tea is the Takaokaya green tea roasted with brown rice (Genmai Cha).  It is a 100% pure Japanese tea in tea bags from Shizuoka (), the foothills of Mt. Fuji.  I heard the Takaokaya teas are grown in strict accordance with international environmental management standard ISO14001.  Even so, it is expensive for $2 a cup.  The servers are very polite and always smiling.  It is a small store but cozy though a bit congested.  The bathrooms are at the basement with a very steep staircase."}
{"text":"Best ramen place I have been to so far. Beats a lot of the more pricier ramen houses in NYC. Came here on a visit and recommendation from a friend.  Went in, it was busy but we were attended to right away.  Waitresses were attentive, food came out quick. Price is reasonable,compared to $13-15 in NYC. Soup base was tasty and flavorful. Ramen was perfectly done. Simple Ramen recipes, as there isn't much crowd the bowl. Very good ramen. Definitely recommend. It was a cool night outside but a tad warm inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has to be my favourite ramen place in Toronto, that is saying a lot considering the number of ramen places here. I have tried a fair amount of different ramen restaurants but I always come back here, that being said there isn't a lot of variety to chose from. I always end up getting the tonkotsu ramen with thin noodles, the noodles are fresh and the broth is flavourful. As for proportion size, I would say it is adequate. I haven't had to wait for a table, I haven't been here during dinner time. However, I have seen a waiting line leading out of the restaurant on numerous occasions. The restaurant is on the small side. The waitresses are friendly and attentive, they always come by to refill the water. I always leave happy and returning for more!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place now twice. The first time I had the Miso Ramen and the soup base tasted very chemical like. Thought I would give it another chance and try again. I was literally sick to my stomach after eating here. Food poisoning. Not sure if it is because the pork they use in the soup sits on the counter top all day long or what it was but I was really sick. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"After trying some other popular ramen joints, I felt like I must visit Sansotei at least once. On a Saturday evening at 6pm, it took around an hour for us to be seated. Beware - the waiting area is outside of the restaurant and they don't give out numbers so you cannot leave your place in line. Remember to bring a jacket for the cool winter days!  After being seated, I ordered the Shio Ramen with regular noodles. When the bowl arrived, I was surprised at how much green onion they gave me. It actually looked like I ordered green onion soup with ramen on the side...   The ramen itself was not the typical ramen you'd get. It was more like noodles you could get at a supermarket rather than some kind of specialty ramen you'd expect after an hour's wait.   The chashu was interesting. Although it was mostly fat, I think they used a fire gun or a similar method to add an extra flair to it. It smelled and tasted great. Now if only there was more meat and less fat...   There was 2 pcs of half boiled eggs in it! Yay to bonuses =)   The soup.. I'm 99% sure there was MSG in it. Not impressed.  Overall, I don't think I would wait an hour for this restaurant again. I'm not disappointed.. but not impressed either."}
{"text":"Second time around. We came 1 hour before closing (~9pm) on a Friday night. After waiting about 10 minutes outside, the three of us were seated at a booth right by the kitchen.  The place was packed and despite being there so late, service was courteous and friendly. This time I ordered the Spicy Tan Tan noodles and they were very good albeit a little oily and salty (but that contributes to its tastiness)! I prefer the balance and richness of the Tonkatsu Black ramen, but this is a winning alternative for days I crave something spicy."}
{"text":"The closest I had to real ramen in Japan, taste wise. I had the tonkotsu ramen, ordered the gyoza and fried chicken (zangi). The gyoza was gone fast since I brought three guys with me lol. So did the fried chicken which was succulent and crispy. I've tried other places in Toronto but I'd have to say sansotei is the most authentic when it comes to their tonkotsu ramen.   There might be a wait however, just cuz it's newly opened and everyone and their mother seems to want to try it out. If you're uptown, definitely try to stop by."}
{"text":"While walking towards the joint we immediately saw a line up by the door. I was ready to tell my wife forget about it due to my hangryness, but luckily I did not submit to defeat. As soon as we entered the place, people were being seated so quickly, in a matter of 10 minutes 5 or 6 couples who were in front of us were. While I ate I saw people come in and get seated almost instantly, so wait a few minutes if there is a line up the turn around is quick.  Now to the food. I don't eat ramen often (it's not my go to meal), and there hasn't been a place that has swept me off my feet. But this joint was good and I'd definitely recommend it.   I had the tomato ramen with scallop, egg, shittake, corn and pork. This meal reminded me of a thinner tomato soup with a lot more depth and flavour with meat and vegetables. I devoured my meal that's all i can say. My hanger subsided so it was a good sized meal.  Staff super friendly and nice.   It appears to be a good date night spot too. A lot of parties of two there while we ate. Its casual so no need to dress up to the nines."}
{"text":"This is still my favourite ramen place. Came here, lined up for about 20 minutes - got a table right at the window so everyone lining up can watch us eat. I wanted to try the spicy tantan but they were out already. So I went back to my favourite - tonkotsu ramen - pork belly, black fungus, egg and green onion. The soup is still delicious. I don't know if I was extremely hungry but I was not full after I finished the bowl. Did they reduce the portion size of the noodles??"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good comments about this ramen place. Apparently they're one of the best ramen place in Toronto but it wasn't as good as they said. Overall ramen is great but it wasn't that good like not really worth all the waiting."}
{"text":"It's a great place to go, especially if you're a ramen person who also enjoy think and flavorful broth. Sansotei gets fresh ramen noodles and flavorful broth, their new tomato based broth ramen is really good too. I don't think I can go to this place every day (because of the densed flavor broth), but I do miss the taste every so often."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen noodle restaurant in Toronto. In fact, there are times when I will come by myself to have a bowl of ramen because of my cravings.   To be honest, I have only tried the tonkotsu ramen and it is so good that I have not had a chance to try the other ones because I keep having to order it."}
{"text":"Very good Ramen for the price and quantity. I had the spicy tantan while my wife had the tonkotsu.  It's comparable to Kenzou in both quality and price.  We did have to wait ~30 minutes on a weekday evening so that was hassle. Otherwise the staff was quite polite.  Would go back if in the area again."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I went to Sansotei for ramen for lunch today. I am not normally a big fan of ramen - I often find it too salty and/or oily, so I usually prefer soba or udon. However, having said that, I was extremely impressed with the quality of the food here. I had miso ramen, which ran me around $9 (or about Y700), and it was excellent. The noodles were cooked perfectly (firm, but not hard) and the broth was really quite delicious - extremely savoury without being over-salted, and not very oily at all. The miso ramen dish comes with some basic toppings (some sliced pork, hardboiled egg, sliced green onions and whole-kernel corn), and extra toppings can be ordered (for a reasonable price).  The decor is really nicely done, brightly lit and open - so it was fairly noisy (not somewhere for a romantic dinner for two). The space itself is fairly small, so my co-worker and I ended up getting the last two seats at the window counter - it was actually funny as several other co-workers waved to us in the front window. If you are self-conscious at all when you eat, you probably should avoid the window counter, as about 500 people walking along Dundas Street will stop to watch you eat. Didn't really bother me (I was having a delicious lunch, and not them) - but just pointing it out for those that do care.  It was fairly busy, even for a Tuesday lunch. There was a fairly big line (which we got to watch from our window seats), however the turnover seems pretty fast, with about 8 or so people in the queue being seated every 15-20 minutes or so as people finish eating and leave. I suggest either coming early, or paying attention to the flow of the queue and trying to catch a quiet period to wait."}
{"text":"Out of the 5 ramen places I've tried (Sansotei, Momofuku, Kinton, Kenzo, Ajisen), this is probably the number ramen joint I'd revisit again.  The lineup is outside and based on first-come-first-serve and you queue with everyone else. I was outside for about 40 minutes before I was seated.   First thing I noticed when I was seated was how inefficient the seating is. There are two booths that probably fits 2 people, then a few tables for 6, and a table at the very front facing outside. They didn't sit anyone at the table facing outside (which was dumb), and they would have two groups of 2 sitting at a table for 6. While it'll be faster to stick 3 groups of 2 there, it's also awkward because one side of the seat is attached to the wall so it'll be hard to go out. Whoever designed this place doesn't know anything about restaurants.  Second, I only ordered the Tonkotsu (pork bone broth). It came with a soft boiled egg, two small pieces of pork belly, and Chinese fungus. At first, it tasted pretty good but when you get to the bottom of the bowl, it gets progressively saltier. Also the noodles were a bit too starchy for my taste. Something about them were a bit off.  Overall, it was good and I'd return again."}
{"text":"My goto place for Japanese ramen. The tomato ramen is my all time favourite. I like that their ramen is a little bit firm and chewy, some of my friends don't like it though."}
{"text":"If you're looking for ramen, or not, you must make it here. The food here is wonderful, ramen to fried chicken (yes fried chicken). Note you may need to wait outside for a seat since the place is small, and might end up in a bit of a communal setting but all in all it's worth it."}
{"text":"Mediocre place. Soup is kinda bland and Portion is small. Seating sucks and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"It was a cooler summer day during our trip and we decided a bowl of hot soup would be perfect for lunch. On a weekday after what we thought would be past the lunch rush, we waited in line outside for about 20 minutes for seats to open up. But oh, was it SO WORTH IT!  Currently this is the best bowl of tonkotsu ramen I've ever had. Not only is the broth amazing - perfectly balanced and flavorful, but the noodles and toppings were equally amazing. I haven't found this to be the case anywhere else I've been (in the States at least). I was a bit greedy and got an extra egg, and if you love ajitama like I do then I'd recommend you do the same! Every mouthful was delicious down to the last drop and yes, I cleaned it.   Sadly I don't remember what hubby got... I know he enjoyed it though. I think I tried it but was so absorbed in mine that's all I can remember now. I know there are several highly rated ramen places in Toronto but I think this one is perfect!"}
{"text":"Ramen broth was not as tasty as the original location and also pork belly better downtown. But Markham location is definitely alot more spacious and better for bigger groups and families with kids. Service was ok."}
{"text":"Great location. Awesome ramen. Excellent service. Recommend more creative ways to accommodate table for 2 i.e. maybe shared big tables. Looking forward to this becoming my go to ramen place uptown once some of the process kinks are ironed out."}
{"text":"spicy ramen is good. fried chicken is awesome. But when you almost finish the ramen. the noodle soup is a little bit salty. Btw, you must wait a long line in cold wind!"}
{"text":"Last time we went to Sansotei was few years back and my wife vomited afterwards, not sure why.  There was a lot of hype back then and we waited for over an hour at their downtown location.  I didn't really like it as well because the soup was strong and salty.  Now they have one in Markham and when we dropped by, we decided to give it another try. Same thing, I felt the soup was a little salty.  The portion is definitely small, I could probably finish two ramen.  The fried chicken side dish was just alright.  Probably would not return to this place again, there are many better ones out there."}
{"text":"As a big fan of kinton, I had to come try this competitor.   Small place, nice decor. We walked in on a thurs night at 8:30pm for table for two. No waits.   Small, concise and clear menu, so far so good.   I read some reviews and decided go with the tongkutsu.. (the first one on the menu). We also got a fried chicken app.  Broth was thick and flavorful, slightly oily. (better than kinton) Pork shoulder was well cooked (similar to kinton), noodles were slightly chewy, nice texture. Egg was runny, my fav (wouldve preferred it uncut).   The fried chicken was just normal. Not bad.   Overall a good place. I would def come back. Kinton still is my first pick tho, as it's closer and has more options. But this is def a good one."}
{"text":"Really great ramen spot, their black garlic oil is definitely not traditional but super special and tastes great. Definitely worth a try, especially at under $10 a bowl."}
{"text":"Taste wise really good ramen place.... Inside is quiet and fancy... But one thing that bothers me is that I saw cockroach in the dining area when I went there.  If you want to go, by all means they have good ramen, but If I have to go back there again...? No...  *I had tonkotsu ramen here, it tastes good and visual is also good  Taste: 4/5 Cleaniness:0/5 (Seeing cockroach while eating is not acceptable) Service: 4/5 Price to proportion wise: 2/5 (compared to other major Ramen places, their topping proportion is very small, especially their chashu )"}
{"text":"I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and, like some of my fellow reviewers, enjoyed the first few sips of the broth. It tasted and looked creamy and was not too heavy at first, and then about halfway through the meal you will find it becoming increasingly salty.  The noodles were not authentic ramen noodles - instead they tasted like Chinese noodles that you'd get at any Asian supermarket. Fatty pork on top was tasty but a bit too fatty - 2 of my friends could not swallow this and had to trim the fat off. Would be nice if they offered a choice between fatty and lean pork like many ramen joints do.   I also found it a bit strange to see a lot of black Chinese mushroom (not quite sure what they are called in English) in my broth. It didn't ruin the taste of the broth but didn't go too well with it either. Instead of these crunchy mushrooms it would've been nice to have some veggies instead. I guess it's one way the restaurant can cut down on the cost (and labour, since all the prep you have to do is soak the dried mushrooms in water, as opposed to prepping fresh vegetables)  Overall I was not impressed by this place and was a bit puzzled to see the line-up at lunch on a Monday. It's definitely better than Kenzo Ramen but falls wayyy short of places like Kinton and the yet-to-come Santouka. I most likely would not return unless I ran out of dine-out options in the area."}
{"text":"Great Ramen, slightly better in Vancouver though! and I don't like paying over 10 bucks for a bowl of ramen!  The broth was rich and not too salty as often is the case. I got the miso with the corn, and yummy!  Hot perfectly chewy fresh noodles (I got the thick noodle),   The most beautiful part is the perfectly cooked egg, only the very center of the yolk was slightly runny making the broth a bit creamier if you mix it all in."}
{"text":"Went to try it out since it was packed inside.  The broth was way too salty for my tastes, (this isn't the one with the salt).   Found the quantity to be smallish, not really worth the money.  9 bucks for a bowl of noodles...understandable for downtown but still, felt sort of lacking. But the main thing was that the bowl of ramen was just too salty..."}
{"text":"The ramen had a nice thick broth but it was lacking in flavor overall. They didn't offer any condiments for the soup like ginger, garlic, nori or vinegar. I was most unimpressed with the noodles. After living in Japan for three years, I was not impressed with this ramen. However, if you haven't had ramen in Japan, this soup could be considered pretty good. The restaurant was efficient and clean with good service. And it was nice to hear a little Japanese again \"???????? - irasshaimase.\""}
{"text":"After reading about reviews comparing this place to Ippudo and my beloved Totto in New York, I had to come here.   If this place were as expensive as Ippudo or Totto (or located in NYC), I would give it a 3. We all ordered the Tonkotsu, and it was clear that the broth was not made from scratch, unlike the aforementioned noodle joints. It was busy during dinner, and this probably made the chef rush a bit - the eggs were very undercooked to the point of runny and the noodles were slightly starchy and could stand to cook a little longer.   However, it was delicious and the service was great. It's easily the best ramen joint I've been to in Toronto. Plus, the Tonkotsu was only $9.25, a price that is unmatched. I'd pick it over any other ramen place in Toronto in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times, I'm surprised I haven't written a review for them until now. This is my favourite ramen place in Toronto. I've tried a number of other restaurants and often found them too salty, bad noodle texture, thin broth, overcooked egg etc. I often order the tonkotsu ramen with garlic oil. The noodles have a good texture to them, broth is creamy and flavourful and the egg yolk is always cooked just right. After trying a bunch of other ramen places in the city and being disappointed, I've learned my lesson and have decided to stick with Sanstotei if I'm looking for a guaranteed satisfying bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"Line-ups are a pain in the ass, especially in the rain. But trust me, it's so worth it.  I almost regret bringing my boyfriend here because now he won't stop talking about how much he loves it and how much he wants it and how much he's craving it. Excuse me sir, would you like a side of girlfriend with your one true love, ramen?  Get the Tonkatsu Black. Honestly, I've never tried anything else from here and I don't think I will ever need to. It's so delicious. That black garlic oil does something magical and you'll never see other ramen places the same ever again. Service is prompt, nice and unobtrusive. If you love ramen, you'll love Sansotei."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Markham. I honestly don't taste a big difference between all the top ramen places downtown. I would say they are fairly priced as it's on the cheaper side and includes the egg and has a good amount of pork belly. Appetizers aren't the great though"}
{"text":"I had Tonkotsu Ramen and I would say its alright; I liked it because it comes with soft boiled eggs but the broth is a bit blended for my liking. Unfortunately, Chashu was not exactly authentic Chashu as Santouka does.  but the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"went here with friends for dinner. It's a small place.  We had to wait outside but they timed it so that we could all fit at the same table! Yes I would go here more often if I lived in the area.   I had the seasalt flavor raven. noodles and service are great. Right amount of saltiness and flavor"}
{"text":"My sis loves ramen and from Yelp, this is the best place where we can walk to. Yeah..It's worth to try."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in Toronto indeed!  Not just tastes awesome, looks awesome, staff service is awesome!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"my fave and #1 ramen place compare to all other ramen place i have tried in toronto, so far.  less salt on the tonkotsu black is always my go to. Quality is always the same no matter when I get it.  it is always delicious!!"}
{"text":"Long lines so hurry!  Come on weeknights instead of wknds.  When I had Kinton ramen last year, I decided ramen wasn't really for me.  It wasn't bad but it was too greasy for my liking.  Thank god I tried sansotei last night which made me a huge ramen fan!  I got the tonkotsu ramen (pork bone broth).  It was delicious, savoury and the noodles were aldante and not overcooked - jsut the way I like them to be.  The fried chicken (zangi) was tender and juicy - each bite was delicious!    Gyoza was fresh - they told us it wuld take 10-15 minutes probably making it from scratch! It was crispy on the outside and filled with yummy goodness on the inside.  watch out though, it's HOT!  Chasu Don - rice with porkbelly and egg on top was yummy. There was some sauce on the rice which was very flavourful.  Definitely recommended for those trying ramen for the first time or if you're a ramen-lover.  It's a fairly small restaurant so make sure you don't go during peak hours.  We didn't have to wait in line - we got there around 6pm on a Monday  but by the time we were leaving, there was a line up.  No worries though, the service is fast and people don't eat for too long inside."}
{"text":"Whenever I think of ramen I think of Sansotei. THE best I've ever had. And they're sides are amazing too. But obviously GET THE RAMEN. It'll be the best decision you make ALL YEAR. YA, I SAID THAT. Also, I sat next to Jack Antonoff when he was in town on tour with Bleachers. Does that mean anything to you? Maybe not. But google him and look how hot he is. THAT guy ATE here! So...you should eat here. There's usually a lineup and the place isnt too big so come during non-busy hours or be prepared to wait a little (outside)."}
{"text":"I felt the Ramen here was mediocre at best.   I've had Ramen most places around the city and honestly this one doesn't even rank for me.   Been to the original downtown location back when it first opened and now the Markham location. Lined up for both. Neither time was very memorable.  Had the Spicy Tan Tan, Black Tonkatsu Ramen, and the Fried Chicken.  Came away unimpressed."}
{"text":"After a long drive back from Montreal we ware craving a good bowl of Ramen. We stop at Sansotei and there was a line up (good sign), luckily we were 3rd in line and soon after there was a very long line. Waited for about 15 min and we were in. Very simple menu but has all you need! Ordered deep fried chicken, gyoza (dumpling), Spicy Tan tan Ramen and tonkatsu black (garlic).  You get a choice of thin or thick noodles. Picked thin noodles for tonkatsu and thick for tan tan. Both were very good! perfectly cooked noodle and broth is rich with flavour. The pork (Cha Siu) was thick but did not have much flavour (my heart broke, almost perfect). That being said I enjoy the Tonkatsu Black over the Spicy Tan Tan.   Gyoza were good as well, fried chicken was okay. Fried chicken would be better if it had a sauce."}
{"text":"I've been to Sansotei a few times (once to the Dundas location, twice to the Markham location), and their ramen is great!  The service is quick and the food is tasty, but maybe just a tad on the pricey side.  The broth is hearty and the noodles are quite good. There's a decent serving of meat, and for a bit extra, you can add other ingredients such as additional meat or and egg.   Will definitely go again in the future!"}
{"text":"I came with friends here during the winter time so it was a good time to sit down and slurp on some warm in your tummy ramen.  Food: It has been a while, so I think I got the tonkotsu ramen. I prefer thin noodle, the texture was well between hard and soft. The broth was smooth and flavourful. A good helping of eggs (2), black fungus, and pork belly (2).   Atmosphere & Service: The waitresses were very helpful when informing us about the items on the menu. The restaurant was small and cozy and the light wooden interior was nice.  Pricing: Reasonable, ~$10.  We waited a bit before they opened because we anticipated there would be a line up if we went during lunch time."}
{"text":"Great Tonkotsu Ramen  the meat was very good  looked like it was grilled . this is a top 3 place for me in the city. it's a must try if you like Ramen. There's always a line up at all these places. Good things are worth the wait. Just a note.. If you never had Ramen or Pho soup and you  are a picky eater like don't like a little fat or salt this stuff  is not for you . These places is where you go for soup and leave. not for a business lunch and dont ask the DUM  question like do you have wifi.  Great Ramen keep up the great work."}
{"text":"excellent ramen!  worth the try service was good for a busy saturday night typical line ups, but it moved along pretty quick i recommend!!"}
{"text":"Really amazing little gem, just the right thing for a cold fall Monday evening. Seriously, the  broth is really flavorful and delicious. I had the isshin red miso, one of their most recommended dishes, would recommend to anyone looking for flavor versus a punch."}
{"text":"This place was quite good by my ramen standards. Up there with Santouka and Orenchi (a hometown favorite in Santa Clara, Calif). They offer two kinds of noodles - the thick one looked better."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Sansotei Ramen Cuisine: Japanese Location: Downtown Address: 179 Dundas St West Price Range: $10~  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3.5 Service: 3.5 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  * Open for lunch & dinner * Closed on Sundays * Specialize in Ramen * Serves alcohol  Yay for another ramen joint in downtown Toronto! There are just too many opening up I can't keep up with all of them. However, I did get a chance to check out Sansotei before I went on my trip to Korea/Japan.  It was on a weekday during lunch hour and I did have to wait around 15 minute or a little more. However, the weather wasn't that cold back then and it wasn't too bad for waiting outside. Since they do focus mostly on ramen, people usually eat and leave right away. This is not a order a bowl of ramen, finish and lounge around type of place.  Obviously there is no time limit on seating (as far as I know), but honestly if you see people waiting outside in the cold waiting to get it- it's common sense to eat and leave right away, yes?   Ordered: Tonkotsu Ramen 4/5  * Bowl of ramen with all the fixings for $9.25 including chasu (pork belly), egg, bean sprout, black fungus and more. This is probably my favorite type of ramen with rich smooth soup that you can actually drink on it's own and you won't feel like you are drowning in sodium afterwards.  It has this very deep milky taste that's almost like cream soup but with a meat based soup. I liked how it came with eggs and all the other things without me having to add it on. Thing about Sansotei ramen is that it's not the regular yellow thicker (egg noodle type) ramen you are used to from Kinton or Kenzo.  It's the straight white noodle which has more of a bite. I saw how some people say they use instant noodles which is so not true. If you ever had real ramen in Japan, they actually have 2 different types of noodles for ramen which one of them is the type they serve at Sansotei.  I personally used to like the yellow ramen better, but on my trip to Japan couple months ago, I tried Tonkotsu ramen with the white straight kind and I fell in love with it! Anyways, I was happy with the noodle and soup but not so much the eggs! Eggs were cooked perfectly with the right consistency but it tasted quite bland which was a let down. Anyways, but I really did enjoy this ramen overall and would probably order this again next time I am there.  Ordered: Miso Ramen 3/5  * Same as the one above but with different soup with miso paste for $9.50. This I found the soup to be way too salty! I know it's Miso ramen so obviously the soup will have stronger taste but it was to a point where I couldnt really drinkt the soup by itself. We had to pour in some of the tea to balance it out.  Summary: Sansotei is a convenient spot for ramen for a quick lunch in the area. I do have to say that they have the best soup out of all the ramen joints I've tried so far in Toronto- and if you haven't tried this type of ramen noodle, give it a try and see the difference! Just another one off of my ramen list and my journey continues.."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen, fantastic service worth every dollar.  I only gave it 4 instead of 5 is due to the wait line; you have to stand outside, in -20C it's not worth it.  If you're looking for authentic great Ramen this is your restaurant."}
{"text":"I was a bit dissapointed. The ramen wasn't actually that good. Service wasn't that good either. I like kiu more. I guess I'll go to downtown for ramen."}
{"text":"Om nom nom. I was never a big fan of Kenzo (except for their takoyaki balls) and was pleased to be introduced to Sansotei which is waaaay better.   I always order the tonkotsu with the sansotei noodles. The milky broth here is the only soup part of noodle soup that I'll ever actually drink. The pork belly isn't as melt in your mouth as the first time I tried it when this place first opened but it's still good. I definitely like the slightly runny egg.   Their ramen great in cold weather when you can drop in for a quick hot bowl before running back outside. It's a tiny space and fine for showing up solo and the service is quick. Not so great for groups bigger than three persons."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places in Toronto! There's almost always a line, even in the winter. But well worth the wait. The ramens are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have first tried sensotei ramen downtown. Their ramen is delicious ! Perfect for the winter weather. However, the one in markham doesn't exactly live up to its name. Their broth was a little too salty on the day that I had it."}
{"text":"Really good ramen place. There's often a line up. You get your food quickly. The broth is pork based and very flavorful. The mushrooms are super good. It's a nice thing to add to your ramen. I feel like people go in, eat and then are out."}
{"text":"I had the Spicy Tantan with thick noodles and it was worth waiting in the cold for (just a couple of people ahead of me in line). Solid ramen game here. The tea was different and very good as well."}
{"text":"Lots of different options and authentic experience. Good value for price, and love that you can choose noodle size. Gyoza were delicious and the ramen was outstanding. Can't wait for their new location to open!"}
{"text":"So excited when I noticed it opened in North York. I am a big santuka fan. But my friend love this one . It's less salty than santuka. The price is better than downtown location. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Good. But not as good as Santoka. ( Did I spell it right? It is the other popular one on the east side of Yonge street on Dundas. ) This place the soup is not rich enough, its like I can make this soup myself.  However Santoka  soup is tastier and richer that you can make something like this at home."}
{"text":"Spicy Tantan for the win! The noodles and broth are spot on. And how the hell do they cook that egg to perfection?!? You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"It's been about 2 years since I have been here. The shio is not the same! There are only 2 pieces of pork belly in my bowl of ramen! I am not sure if I will come back again."}
{"text":"Did not blow me away but I really like the way they make their eggs. I feel like the soup could have a little more dimension but the meat was very tender. All the servers were super sweet."}
{"text":"First time experiencing authentic Ramen, and I wish I could have had it more than once. Perfect spice, perfectly cooked noodles. Delicious. Very small place so don't be alarmed if you have to wait outside."}
{"text":"A little salty, but tasty. Unfortunately, their veggies primarily consist of bamboo shoots, which I don't eat. Added that their menu is so limited, while a place I might recommend to others, probably a place I will not revisit."}
{"text":"So many people review about the ramen so I'm going to review the customer service and experience. The hosts/hostesses are so adorable and hard working. It's such a beautiful space. Narrow but full all the time. I come here alone sometimes and get seated across another lone diner; it's a beautiful thing. We chat about the fried chicken (which is GREAT and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) and then part ways because keeping in touch with strangers is weird in Toronto. Connections with people in Toronto are fleeting, just like the ramen. In 15 minutes you can be devouring the ramen and it's gone before you know it. I wish I could bottle up the experience of eating that ramen in and open it up any time. It reminds me of home, even though I never made [this calibre of] ramen at home. Coming to Sansosei always makes me feel like I'm bring covered in a cozy warm blanket that came straight out of a dryer. I love you, Sansotei. I hope you love me back too."}
{"text":"Really, really meh.   Like everyone else at the restaurant, I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen. So here's the breakdown:  - Soup base was very salty - Soup was warm, not hot  - Noodle was not Ramen - there was no texture to it at all - Ridiculous wait time gives new customers unmet expectations of the Ramen - Small Portions  + The pork was delicious and fatty + Due to the small size of Sansotei, service was quick and friendly   Would I return?  Nope."}
{"text":"Good place for ramen in Markham. Tonkatsu Black  ramen is the best choice on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already since it first opened. Their ramen is very tasty! I'm a big fan of the garlic black ramen with thick noodles. It's my go to ramen.   I usually also always get an order of gyoza too. They have pan fried here which I prefer over the deep fried.  I've also tried their matcha cheesecake. Its nothing out of this world but it's quite delicious still!   The parking lot at this location is Not the greatest. So make sure you check the signs before you leave your car.   They do get quite busy during the lunch and dinner rushes, but if you go at an odd time you will easily get a seat."}
{"text":"I visited Sansotei Ramen this past weekend after hearing about all the rave reviews; believe the hype, it is worth waiting for their ramen!  The broth is meaty and flavourful.  Noodles are just right.  The bowl of ramen is so warm and inviting, you might want to have a second bowl to go.  Unfortunately, it is all meat-based soups here.  Veggies beware.  They do make a mean seaweed salad and edamae.  Try and get a seat away from the door, it gets a bit drafty.  I will definitely return for my ramen fix."}
{"text":"Good service, good atmosphere and an excellent date spot!   Menu is pretty simple, couple of options, not many. Decent price that is standard for ramen places. I ordered the Shoyu and I thought the broth was savoury but too salty. I think there was an excessive amount of MSG or something because my tongue felt tingly for a good hour after.   Pork is well seasoned and cooked and egg is runny and soft. Overall, I would come again but would order a tall glass of water to quench the saltiness haha."}
{"text":"Incredible ramen, awesome experience, great service, although had to wait 20 mins outside in -15C."}
{"text":"I'll preface by saying that I've been to Japan. I've been lucky enough to eat ramen there. To experience some of the tastiest and most flavourful broth and perfectly cooked noodles. So I'm kinda picky about my ramen.  I was really excited when I moved to Toronto - easy access to so many ramen joints. And after a quick tour of the major players in the city I found my favourite one: Sansotei Ramen. It's the most authentic and delicious ramen in Toronto. That broth has great depth. The noodles are offered in ether thin or thick versions. The ingredients are fresh. The price point works (unlike another competing ramen joint that charges $20+ for one bowl of ramen).  I've enjoyed both the Tonkotsu Black and Spicy Tan Tan ramens. Both are delicious - just depends if you're in the mood for some spice! One of the most comforting bowls - especially in winter time!"}
{"text":"Lots of seating at this location. Much bigger and they make an effort not to have you seated right up against the next table unlike the downtown location.   The service is super attentive which is important, so customers can get in and get out quickly which they need to make money.   The food came super fast after ordering. They are prepared for the lunch rush! My egg was perfect and the food came out at the perfect temperature to start eating.   Will return and give it its last store when they start serving more of their snack dishes at lunch."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to get good ramen! I love the flavour and spice level they were able to adjust for me.   I really appreciated the service and will definitely come back here with my friends for great food and service!"}
{"text":"Perfect doneness of half boiled eggs. To-die-for miso ramen. It was almost better than santouka. Two different styles though. Tonkotsu ramen was great too, but I'm a huge fan of their miso ramen. If we go back to TO, we will definitely stop by again.   Try thick noodle for the better texture."}
{"text":"Awesome Ramen restaurant close to Eaton's center. I had the spicy tan tan which was not that spicy but still delicious. The broth is really good - made in house from pork bone (not from powder as done cheaper places will do). The menu is relatively simple but I would not list that as a negative."}
{"text":"Got in there before the line formed and a good thing. Yummy porky ramen. Could not stop eating even when I was full. Incredibly cheap and tasty, what more could you ask for.  The beers are $6 which seems high when a meal is $9. Easily get out of there for under $15, but if you want a beer make it $20.  Waitress claimed the credit card machine was broken. I told her I did not have any Canadian cash and as if by magic she returned with a working machine."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen restaurants toronto has to offer. I went there for the first time today and there was a line outside (mind you the weather was negative 10 Celsius and freezing rain) the line was about 4 to 6 people. The location is just a really a hole in the wall, we were given a piece of paper with a number. The wait was about 5 to 10 minutes long but it felt longer because it was cold and raining outside.   The service was really good and didn't get annoyed when I mispronounced the ramen and asked how to say it properly. Among all the chaos of food moving around and people going in and out they were very calm.  The food came fast in less than 10 minutes of ordering. Got the tonkotsu Black Ramen with the side of fried chicken and gyoza, the waitress told us that the gyoza would take some time. The ramen was on point with all the fixings, the pork belly was plenty and the noodles was just enough. The broth was really good but for some reason as I got down to the last bit it started getting salty and I stopped there. The fried chicken comes in small bite size pieces and boneless. The gyoza tastes the same as every other place to be honest.  The price was really good for what we had ordered Definitely would come back again when it's a bit warmer outside."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the ramen at Sansotei...at first.  But by the time I finished my bowl, it was just okay.  I got the Tonkotsu Ramen, and the first sip of broth was really nice and creamy and I loved it while it was hot.  But by the time I got to the bottom of the bowl I found it really salty.  The pork tasted amazing, but there were only two thinly sliced pieces of it in the bowl.  The noodles were pretty good but at the same time, noodles can only get so good.  So while I did like the taste of the ramen, it's a little expensive for $9.25+tax+tip.  If there was more meat in the bowl and it was a bit cheaper, I'd give it one more star.  Also they don't take a waiting list there...you just have to stand in line in the order you came in, in the tiny space at the front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"$35+ for mediocre ramen (tonkatsu were too salty to us) and bad deep fried chicken(how can you messed up on the chicken?) which didn't even make me full. I'm still hungry when I leave the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend during a Saturday afternoon. It was quick service, we each had ramen, they are rice noodles and are gluten free. Came atop with an edible flower, great presentation. Wish there were more GF options for appetizers to share, or dairy free desserts."}
{"text":"It was very good, definitely worth the line. It is full of spice, a bit on the salty side but I'm all for more than less. I really liked the velvety noodles and the broth, again it's balanced but hefty in the spices. The gyoza are also a great start to a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"I got the regular shio ramen. The food was great: The soup was nice and thick, and noodles were cooked perfectly. I wish they put more soup & noodles because I wasn't full after eating the whole bowl. Great atmosphere, clean, and the servers were very friendly and prompt. I would come back again for more."}
{"text":"So delicious! I had Sansotei for the first time in Boston and then I had it again in Toronto. Both times, the flavours were consistent and delicious. They also have quick service.  It gets hot in here even with the AC and fans. So if it's hot outisde, I wouldn't recommend getting a ramen."}
{"text":"I came to Sansotei with a friend and we had to wait in line when I arrived at the restaurant. The restaurant is very small. The location is convenient because it's right next to St Patrick station and you can just walk to the restaurant in a minute or two. From what I've heard, it's also very close to Ryerson University.  My friend is very hungry so it's good that our food arrived very fast. They have a tiny menu. Both my friend and I ordered tonkotsu black and fried chicken. The broth of the tonkotsu black is delicious and not overly salty. I loved the pork slices so it was a good thing that I ordered extra slices plus egg and vegetables. The noodle is pretty good. The fried chicken is also nice.  I would definitely come here again in the distant future when I want to eat ramen for the 3rd or 4th time until now, because I gotta check out the other ramen places, too."}
{"text":"|| Must Try: Tonkotsu (with Thick Noodles), Spicy Tan Tan, Extra Pork Belly  || Rating: (7/10) Food, (9/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness  || My Experience:     Far from a ramen expert, I have had the opportunity to dine at majority of Toronto Ramen shops, as well as a vast number across North America. Sansotei Ramen is a solid above average. This is not a shot to the quality at Sansotei, but that the quality of ramen overall in Toronto has risen.   Having tried most of their soups, I would recommend Tonkotsu. There seems to be most flavour behind it. The only problem is that I find the soup to veer too far into the salty side, which is saying much, as I often don't critique a dish based on saltiness. The stand out part of Sansotei would have to be the noodles. The thick noodles are bouncy and have a great texture. Their pork bell is also done quite well, so I recommend getting an extra order.   The location is convenient with the shop consisting of mostly booths and having large sharing tables in the middle. Service was friendly and helpful, and was careful to ask which type of noodles we wanted and give recommendations on the best noodles for which broth.   Overall, great spot for ramen, possibly one of the best in Markham, but with the varied options in the City, it's personally not the de facto best ramen in Toronto overall."}
{"text":"This is my go to Ramen place. Spicy Tan Tan is my all time favorite whenever it is available.   + extra noodle + 1 of each extra toppings  please make it stop, i am drooling thinking about.  This is one of the better Ramen places in Toronto.  What are you waiting for go in already!  I've been to both locations, the 650 Yonge Street is less busy."}
{"text":"Lineups seem to be a constant here, with the peak hours seeming to be the lunch hours (11:30am-2:00pm) and dinner (6:30pm-9:00pm). If you decide to come by during these hours, expect at least a 30 minute standing wait on the sidewalk.  My go-to is the Tonkotsu Black, a pork bone broth made only more awesome by the droplets of dark-hued oil floating on the top, traditionally made by fermenting garlic - though if you're inclined to try and DIY, you'll find methods of making garlic with an oven, saucepan, sous-vide, or even in a rice cooker.  The all-important broth here is OK, it was a super salty when they first opened here a few years ago but have since then improved it by a lot and is now a regular level of ramen salty.  Which is good, because you can choose your noodle thickness, but you can't choose the salt or fattiness level here.  Remember that tea, whether cold or black, will cost you $2.  So when the waitstaff asks if you'd like tea, make sure you realize you're going to pay extra for it.  Cold tea is served unsweetened.  I hear a lot of good things about the green tea muffin dessert from those who have ordered it, but have yet to physically witness someone eating it in-store.  So I can stare at them intensely and watch their reaction.  Hmm, I probably should've kept that creepo comment to myself. ( °  °)  Don't worry, even if you find me weirding you out, you'll probably at least still enjoy your ramen."}
{"text":"If you are ever craving ramen in Markham, this is the place to go! The food here is always amazing and the service is exceptional. I recommend the miso black with a side of zangi"}
{"text":"It's good ramen. Sometimes there is a long line and you'd have to wait outside (Which sucks during winter) but the food is great. I find that the proportions aren't the best. I'd like to have more ramen pls tyty!!"}
{"text":"This place has never has disappointed it's always been good each time !! My favorite is the 10:10 ramen ..it's spicy and delicious the only thing that I can complain is the portions are a little too small compared to some of the places that I've been too but the quality and taste.. and it's an extremely clean Place both locations but I do like the Markham location little bit more. I also tried the garlic oil on and that's very good too"}
{"text":"This place has always been on point. The new Richmond hill location is living up to their standards. They are clean and friendly .  I love their spicy tantan ramen .  Their salt based black ramen is also very delicious... it's a bit more portioned than the Tan tan...i still like the tan tan more.  Gyoza could be a little bit more cooked but the taste was perfect .  Their staff is also extremely nice. They are closed Monday's."}
{"text":"Revisted with a large group of friends (11 in total). The table arrangements were mainly booth styled. I believe only 1 big group can be served at one time, with some booths holding up to 4 guests.   The noodles have improved since my last visit. The tonkosu soup was hot, and the chashu meat were grilled and tasty. It also comes with my favourite ramen egg. The zangi is a tasty side dish and I'd choose that over the slow-cooked wings.  As I remembered, this location is still not as busy as other Sansotei locations. The price is also reasonable. I'm glad the owner and managers takes their customer's reviews in mind and improve their service."}
{"text":"Busy ramen joint serving up bowls of piping hot ramen. Menu is not complicated, only a couple of items to choose from. Always a lineup but seats do turnover quickly if you have the patience to wait.  Miso Black - flavourful broth with black garlic oil. Loved the ramen egg and matches well with the thick noodles. Has sauteed mushrooms with the ramen. Finished it all with the soup!  Tonkotsu - kind of lacking in flavour compared to the miso black. 2 big slices of pork and ramen eggs!   Some ramens don't come with egg. They're my favourite and I don't really feel like paying $1 for 1 egg.  On the high end in terms of pricing compared to other ramen places. Even though they make you share tables if you only have 2 people, they always leave space in between 2 groups so you don't feel crammed."}
{"text":"They've got the best ramen in town! You'll usually end up waiting to get a seat, but it is well worth it. I normally opt for the Spicy Tan Tan. Everything from the broth, flavor and spices is just perfect. You have the option to add additional ingredients to your meal, such as extra meat or extra egg, etc.  Take your time and enjoy the broth, because it will just be perfect! I would highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Cute small area, with friendly staff. First time here and we had to share a table with other people which I don't mind. The portion of the noodle and soup is good. Not much msg as I didn't feel very thirsty after eating. I order spicy chicken wings and tonkotsu black with extra egg (the menu didn't say it came with an egg but It actually did) the egg wasn't good, tasted weird to me but It was a runny York made it well. The pork was lean didn't have enough fat on it and was plain. The soup was good I can taste the pork flavor and the garlic flavour from the garlic oil. I order the thick noodle and it had good chewy texture, my fiancés got thin noodles and he really liked it cause it was light and he can enjoy the soup more. It's not bad I only came because of all the reviews saying it's one of the best. The wings are actually spicy love spicy so it was mild to me but my fiancés who can't eat spicy though they were pretty hot."}
{"text":"Tried all 6 ramen dish and can't say that I disliked any of them! The spicy tan tan is one of my favourites and they run out of it pretty quickly since there's only limited quantities"}
{"text":"Let me get this out of the way first. I love Asian food and my first review had to be about one of my favourite foods!  I love instant ramen and decided to try out my favourite soup at a real ramen restaurant. Im so glad Sansotei was my first ramen experience.  I order Tonkotsu Black, pork ramen with black garlic oil. The combination of flavours put my mouth in heaven! One of the best things I've ever tasted, the rich broth, tasty pork, black fungus (mushrooms) and delicious garlic oil combined with one another created the perfect food. Also the egg is cooked to perfection. This dish is super garlicky so depending on your preference, it might not be for everyone.   I've been back 2 more times, one time decided to try Spicy Tantan but unfortunately they were sold out due to limited quantity.    I turned my friends onto ramen as a result, perfect soup on a cold day.   I'll be back many more times! Thank you Santosei for making one of my favourite food perfectly."}
{"text":"Not great, quality really has deteriorated over the years due to their success. The broth is condensed with no flavour of pork bones. Ramen turned into instant noodles.   You can learn from McDonald's but that doesn't mean you can replicate their success. Ramen isn't suppose to be made on an assembly line."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert, but this was the best ramen I've ever had. Better than what I love in LA."}
{"text":"Sansotei is my favourite place in Toronto for ramen, bar none. Although the lineups can be long, the wait is worth it. My go-to is the spicy tan tan which hits the spot in terms of heat and flavour. I usually get it with thin noodles as I find it makes it easier to eat.  Be prepared to share your table with other diners, this restaurant is very small so communal dining is a thing. They do tend to turn the tables quite fast, however, so musical chairs is unfortunately a necessity during busy times.  Other popular items on the menu include the tonkotsu ramen and zangi (chicken karaage) which are both amazing in their own right. Personally, I like things spicy so have not ventured past the tan tan.  If you like ramen, go here immediately. Others might imitate, but Sansotei is the best in the city by far!"}
{"text":"Good service and good food. I ordered the Tonkotsu with thick noodles which was served quickly. The soup was super rich and tasty, however, serving size wasn't too big and there are only 2 pieces of char siu in the bowl. The egg yolk's texture was great. Overall food was tasty and would return for that.   Service felt a bit rushed as there is rather high turnover."}
{"text":"I really, really liked the soup here. I was craving for good ramen noodles and it's exactly what I wanted to eat. Why 4 stars though? While the food was amazing, service was really friendly, and we got seated relatively quickly(oh and it's not loud at all), I find the menu lacking in choices. Maybe that's why the food gets ready so quickly cause the only choice for meat is pork belly. You get to choose between thick, traditional or thin noodles. I got the thick, but I tried the thin noodles and liked it more. Like I said, it would have been 5 stars if they had more variety, and the portions were just a tiny bit bigger. I'll go next time I want noodles, but it's not a place you get to experiment with food."}
{"text":"1) Many different options of flavours. 2) Strong and flavourful broth (more on the heavier side). 3) Options for thin or thick noodles (Yay!) 4) Great quality meats. 5) Affordable! 6) Awesome service.  Only complaint would be the long wait (but the line goes quite quickly; maybe a 15 minute wait for 2 people during peak times).  One of my favourite ramen joints in DT Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great spot!  Had the Spicy tantan and the fried chicken, both were awesome!  Aside from a 10-15 minute wait (even when it's raining), will def. return when I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place has everything going for it.  Great style, great staff, great buzz...but they are short one star because the noodle quality was not the best.  In fact, some of the worst noodles (thin style) I've ever had outside of cooking it myself at home.  The broth and other ingredients were on point and it disappointed me greatly to have the experience ruined by the item you think would be flawless by now.  I ordered the black tonkotsu.  Avoid the lines by going solo and skip the larger parties waiting outside for a table.  They do not have green iced tea, but the black iced tea they offered was very good with a hint of fruit."}
{"text":"On a cold day nothing beats a bowl of ramen.  Sansotei is one of the latest of the famous ramen places in Toronto I have visited, and is the most talked about among my friends.  If you have tried the other places like Kinton, Raijin, Kenzo, Ajisen, and Santouka, you should have a good feel for the ramen scene in Toronto.  Being impressed with some of the other places I've been to already, I walked in expecting to be disappointed, but came away happy.  First of all, the portions here are huge!  I ordered the miso with a side of bamboo shoots, and asked for a free dish of garlic oil, which they happily obliged.  This place easily has the biggest portions of char siu and corn of all the ramen places, and throws in a soft boiled egg to boot.  You're definitely getting value for your money here.  The miso broth is a little salty for my taste, and is not as rich as I would prefer, which makes it a little tough if you finish the soup with your ramen like me.  If you just partake in the noodles without the soup, then the saltiness is fine.    Overall this place is a solid bet for your ramen needs, though it's up to personal taste which is better.  Santouka has the better broth but smaller portions, whereas Sansotei has bigger portions, so depending on your ramen style, choose accordingly."}
{"text":"A solid bowl of ramen noodles made with perfect noodles and salty, tasty broth. I usually get the shio ramen and it is among the best I've had. I also enjoy their gyozas, homemade and not deep fried. Service is quick and friendly.  The space at the Dundas location in downtown Toronto is small and narrow and so there is often a wait. They are opening a new location 5 min from where we live and I look forward to it!!!"}
{"text":"Sansotei ramen was good! The noodles and topping were really on point but the broth was too salty. It contained many delicious flavours but overall it was just really thick and oily. My friend and i also got the zangi and it was really juicy and delicious. The environment and the customer service was amazing. Definitely will go again and try something else out!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing! Way better than the other places I've gone too; then again my ramen selection of places that I've visited isn't very large. The broth is the real winner here and the added garlic oil really hits the spot. We also ordered their chicken karage. Nothing too special about those. Would just come here again for the ramen and if you're really hungry then maybe extra noodles.  I ordered the Tonkatsu Black and added corn and an extra egg"}
{"text":"DROOOOOLSSS!  (It's pretty late right now, should probably be going to bed, but all I can think about is food and how good this ramen was)  I love ramen.   Sooo whenever I'm nearby any ramen, I'm right there giving it a try! We ordered tonkatsu black (creamy pork bone flavour with roasted garlic oil), Miso black (classic miso - Sapporo and Tokyo style with roasted garlic oil), and of course gyoza.   The flavours in the broth are amazing! Soooooo much flavour with lots of toppings! The gyoza was pretty good but not amazing.   Service was very quick and our server was very nice! I'm definitely gonna be back to try petty much everything else on the menu!!  SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I have been dying to go to this place but the long wait always gets the better of me. Mr. H and I did manage to go on a tuesday after yoga and it was the best!  Even though it was a tuesday we still had to wait a bit since all tables were full, once in we were given the menus and placed an order, all in 5 minutes. The work fast here, service is quick and the food comes out fast too. So if you are looking for a place to sit and catch up or be slow about... it might not be the best spot for it.  Thanks to yelp I already knew what I wanted, I got the Tonkotsu Black and it was delicious! Mr. H had the Tomato and he said it was good but not as good as mine... so there you go.  It's for sure the best I've had in Toronto and would definitely recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Thanks to my ramen-loving friend (read: addicted), I've been to a handful of ramen joints in the downtown core.  This one wins.    I've had the tonkatsu (pork bone) broth and the miso broth.  Both are winners, in my opinion (but this is up for debate).  I especially like the fatty pork belly, soft boiled egg and veggies that are all included.  Note that the veggies vary depending on your order, but you can always add extras.  I prefer thick noodles over thin ones.  (That's what she said.)    LOVE the mochi balls for dessert.  Would you like green tea or chocolate?  Ummm.. both please.  So good that my date ordered a second helping!  (Don't judge.)    Tiny place, but I've been lucky enough to arrive at the right time and not have to wait.  Food comes out super quick too.  If you want fried chicken, order early - they take a little longer.  Outside signage is not great.  Look for the adorable asian place beside Twelve o' lunch."}
{"text":"Really loved the ramen here. I ordered the Tonkotsu and my husband had the Tonkotsu Black and they were both good. We had them with thin noodles as suggested by the staff.  We also had the gyoza but I didn't enjoy that as much. Overall, I was delighted to find a good ramen place at the center of Markham. The place was packed at 5:30 in the afternoon which was an indicator this place is a must-try. I'll definitely come back and try other flavors."}
{"text":"Had the tonkotsu and miso black ramen.   Service:4/5  Ambience is 3.5/5 (tiny, but, comfortable space)  Now for the ramen, it's good, but Isshin is still my favourite by far."}
{"text":"I fear I might have a new addiction. I already have a soft spot for ramen, but the tonkotsu black with garlic oil is one of the best I've ever had. I ordered thick noodles as I always do, and they were perfectly done and slightly chewy. The pork pieces were seared on both sides and almost melted in my mouth. The garlic oil on top of the creamy broth was the perfect addition to the tonkotsu ramen. I don't think I can ever go back to the original.   Go early or be prepared for a wait. It is so worth it, though. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am addicted to their Tonkotsu ramen. The chasu is perfectly cooked, seared with a bit of a bite and a bit of fat, the soup is delicious and creamy, the noodles are awesome. If I could come here daily I would.  The service was totally fine when I went -- if it's busy, don't linger, it's a TINY restaurant.  Authentic Japanese ramen. MMmm.."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Toronto, but lines are too much of a hassle for me to come back.  My problem with eating out for ramen is that it's ALWAYS too salty. Thankfully, they allow you to adjust the salt added to the broth; I requested less salt in my tonkotsu, expecting it to be just watered down broth, but was pleasantly surprised that it came out flavourful and light. The  deep fried chicken was delicious as well, and the tofu cheesecake was phenomenal! Price is great too.  The only reason I did not give a five star rating is due to the constant lineups. The tiny restaurant has always been so popular and we waited outside in the cold for 30-40min to get seated. Two customers in front of us were holding a spot for 10....which is ridiculous. Smaller parties were emptying out of the restaurant and everyone behind had to wait until there were 10 spots for the whole party to sit together. What's the point of making everyone line up if you're just going to allow 8 people to walk right in and take up half of the restaurant? They should consider enforcing a policy for large parties."}
{"text":"The ramen here has the most delicious broth. Their black garlic sauce that comes in the broth is amazing.  I also like that they have two options for the noodles (thick or thin). Their boiled egg is not the ramen type of boiled egg though... it is not the marinated soft boiled egg that you can find at some other ramen places. The ones they have here are just regular hard boiled eggs. They have long line-ups almost all the time but the service is pretty fast so you won't end up waiting for too long."}
{"text":"Soup was good. Noodles were not from scratch. Pork was cooked well. Had to wait in line in the cold. Ambiance was nice. Had to share table with another group."}
{"text":"I'm biased towards this restaurant because their downtown location was the first real ramen place I've visited before the other similar ramen places popped up around the GTA.  My four stars here apply solely to my bias for their ramen and broth in addition to the convenience that it's much closer to home in Markham.  To begin with, this location is much bigger than downtown and is not as busy as it had been when it first opened.  The staff are always friendly, though in their best intentions they are still pretty busy and don't always remember to bring water, etc.  I've tried all the appetizers here, and while all are okay, it pales compared to the broth/ramen.  Some will find the broth to be slightly on the salty side, but I enjoy that level of flavour.  I find the portion to be just right but my friends have found they need to add more noodles.    Note: currently do not offer appetizers during lunch time.  This is pretty disappointing given their already limited menu.  There are only 5 types of ramen and limited toppings to add, so this is something that definitely needs improving.  This is one of the reasons my parents do not enjoy coming here because they look for variety and options at their repeat visits.  Also, they do not have any take out noodle bowls which is silly for a ramen restaurant.  I had ordered but had to leave immediately but found out they only have regular takeout boxes (not intended for soup).  When asked what I should do for the broth, they said I should just pour it into the box and be very careful in keeping the box leveled!  Is this for real?"}
{"text":"By far, the best ramen in Toronto. My order is usually the Shoyo or Spicy Tantan ramen with extra chashu or egg. You'll want to lick the bowl afterwards b/c the broth is so magical. The noodles have that amazing ramen noodle chew to them. The egg and chashu are always perfectly cooked. Do not let the lineup deter you. It's worth the wait. Not 5 stars because sometimes you feel rushed to get in there, slurp your ramen and get out."}
{"text":"After watching Tampopo at tiff and feeling the ramen hunger I made the trek to Sansotei Ramen to see if the hype was real and...Indeed it is! One of the servers was quick to address me at the door and said there would be a 5 min wait for a table. Having got my seat in short time I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen and a hot tea.  Taking in my surroundings I noticed the place is quite small and narrow with simple tasteful decor dominated by bamboo. Japanese pop played over the restaurant which seems de rigueur for ramen restaurants in Toronto. In about 5-6 minutes from sitting down the waitress brought me my bowl of ramen and the tea, that was fast!   I dipped my spoon in the broth and took a taste...Oh my god this was pure heaven! I mean...The broth was really, REALLY good. I picked up my chopsticks and dived in. The noodles firm but pliable, the pork tender and tasty, the egg was a lil chill for my liking, and again the milky white broth which was heavenly. I devoured it all down to the last drop eagerly. This was a really good ramen soup, up there with the best I've ever had.   Highly recommended for ramen lovers, for what I experienced I'm giving it top marks and will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Came here for a Friday lunch with my Mom and sister. My Mom got the tonkotsu, sister got the shoyu, and I settled for the lighter shio. Oh my gosh, that first sip of the tonkotsu broth was absolutely heavenly! Very rich. I've made my own pork bone broth at home before, and I can honestly attest that this flavour was extremely similar to mine... meaning that it's pretty authentic and genuine. I won't mention names, but it is far more superior than another ramen place highly touted for its broth. My sister loved her shoyu, but felt that its flavour was much more muted. She also found that it tastes strongly of bamboo shoots, but still enjoyed it overall! As for my shio, it was light and delicious. I would say that all three portions were average sized... you wouldn't be extremely full, but comfortably so. All the while, we kept eyeing the signature tonkotsu black that everyone around us had ordered. Next time, we're definitely ordering that!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friends last week for lunch after finishing up uni. We have been thinking of trying this place as there's always a lineup outside. Fortunately the line wasn't too long and we only had to wait for around 5-10 minutes before we were led inside to be seated. The interior decor was lovely, kind of a modern Japanese setting.  For the food, I ordered the special ramen that has limited quantity everyday and it was delicious. There was some kind of red stringy crunchy topping that really brought out the flavor. Only critique I have is the thick layer of oil on top of the soup was too heavy. And it would be nice if they had ramen with other meat options aside from pork.   All in all, lovely place for lunch. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I was craving ramen so I found this place on Yelp while I was DT. I've seen good reviews so I decided to give it a try but it turned out to be a bit of a disappointment in terms of their service. The waitress that served me was quite rude - no greets, ignoring me, and giving attitude. Food wise, it's basically your average Japanese ramen that you would expect. Can't say I would go there again in the near future."}
{"text":"Small variety but amazing food. Do expect a wait.  Sansotei Ramen Markham I feel is somewhere better than the downtown location. It is located inside the Whole Foods Plaza one Hwy 7 beside PetValu. Small restaurant so sometimes you may need to share a table. Good lighting and cleanliness. Soup broth is way better than Ajisen. All their food is to perfection. Good portion (for me) so the boys may want to add extra noodles which is also on the menu.   Sapporo is now on tap for $6.50 per pint or $17.00 a pitcher. I personally like the Asahi Black better.  Service is hard to say because it's really order, drop and go. But overall I enjoyed my stay except for the wait. I came on a Wednesday for dinner and I waited from 7:13pm to 7:49pm till I got a table for three. If you're lucky you might get a table faster than 30 mins."}
{"text":"Had Ramen for the first time last week. We were told upon sitting down that the Spicy Tan Tan and the Tonkotsu Black are the most popular. They're quite different from each other so it was tough choosing. The Spicy Tan Tan, as the name implies is a very spicy sesame flavour, with soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and ground pork. The Tonkotsu Black has a very strong garlic flavour with a soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and black fungus.  My boyfriend and I got both because we couldn't decide. We both liked the Spicy Tan Tan better and would recommend that one if you're having a hard time choosing. But it depends on your palette. If you're into spicy, go with the Spicy Tan Tan. If you're into anything garlic, try the Tonkotsu Black.  Both are super salty though. I would highly recommend asking them to use less salt. The flavours in both dishes are enough for a good meal! Will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars- Got the tonkotsu ramen and it was on point as per Canadian ramen standards."}
{"text":"I always seek for the best tonkotsu ramen because I know how hard it is to make. I've tried and failed several times. This is almost the only ramen I order in any ramenya.   If you are a fan of tonkotsu ramen and are stuck in Toronto, definitely give Sansotei a try. They are easily one of the best ramen places I've tried in the GTA. Good broth, tender pork, and what I appreciated the most is how the eggs were cooked, soft and perfect with a runny yolk. Unusual that thats what I remember the most from the bowl.  I rate this place a 4 against other toronto ramen spots but to be honest, compared to Ippudo or what i've tried in Japan, its a 2 or 3 at best. It is way better than what I had in vancouver though."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just what I go that wasn't as good because everyone seems to love this place. I've been here on several occasion and had the tonkatsu and spicy tan tan ramen. Don't get me wrong, their ramen is delicious but it's not omg this is the best ramen ever.  I will return because their ramen is delicious and it's just the right amount where I don't leave feeling like death and needing to roll over into a food coma."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try Sansotei but every time I pass by the downtown Dundas location it's always full. I was really excited when I got a project in Markham and I get to visit once a week. Finally tried Sansotei with no line ups. Located in the Hwy 7 and Birchmount plaza. There's lots of parking for lunch. Space is typical size for all the ramen joints small but turnover is quick. Service is prompt and friendly. I've only visited twice and tried the Tonkotsu ramen. The $10 price tag was very fair for the size you get and all the toppings included, I like that each piece of cha su is broiled. The ramen base has a good salt content. I've ordered thick noodle both times, I was originally thinking of something thicker so anything less is too thin. Luckily I have a few more months to go with my project so I have lots of time to go thru their menu. Definitley coming back for more!  Tip: most of their appetizers are only available during dinner."}
{"text":"First time trying Sensotei, which is pretty surprising because I have tried most of the ramen places in Toronto. Showed up around 7 PM on a weekday dinner and the place was quite busy. There was a short line and we were seated within 15 minutes.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Black Ramen, Shio Ramen, and Zangi (Chicken Karaage). I wanted to order the slow-cooked chicken wings but then the server said that they were sold out, which was disappointing. The food came really quickly. The ramen was good and the noodles were cooked to the right texture. The broth was also good but not the best I have ever had. The chicken was fried nicely and the fresh lemon paired nicely with it.  The location is great because there aren't many good authentic ramen options in the Markham region. I would definitely return, especially during cold winter nights when I am craving ramen!"}
{"text":"Tonkotsu Black gives you this really strong garlicky flavor in the soup. Perfect for garlic lover. Tomato ramen was something I'd never seen before so I ordered it and am glad I did it. The tomato soup base opens up a brand new level of fusion to Japanese ramen. I felt like it is east (ramen) meets west (tomato soup). Loved it.   You have a choice of either thin or thick noodles. Both were cooked to perfection. I could slurp these noodles all day!   The boiled eggs: all the white was fully set, the yolk was mostly set, but still a little runny in the middle. That's my type of soft boiled egg.  The price was very reasonable for such great quality."}
{"text":"When I first tried them when they opened up downtown, I wasn't too thrilled with their ramen. I didn't think it was flavourful enough but then I realized it was a \"me\" problem because I haven't figured out what kind of ramen I prefer. Now, I usually order the Tonkotsu Black which has rich creamy pork flavour with black garlic oil. What I don't like is that I cannot choose the cut of pork (they serve it with pork belly but I prefer a leaner cut of the pork). Nonetheless, it doesn't stop me from ordering this and picking off pieces of the pork.  I usually go to the one uptown now and their service have been consistently good. Although the place is a little small, it is clean and well-kept. Great place to have a delicious ramen fix when you're not willing to travel too far!"}
{"text":"The dishes here are very traditional and in my opinion the best ramen in Toronto. The broth is delicious and creamy and flavourful (depending on the type you get there's also a lighter, purer broth that's very good), the noodles are tender and just right, the pork belly is very tender and delicious and all of the other ingredients were done just right. Very affordable and fast service even this the location is extremely busy. Definitely like to go here when I can!"}
{"text":"This is the third Sansotei I've been too and it was the best experience by far! The interior is nice, comfy and well lit. The food was on par with the others. It was quick and the service was truly excellent. The workers had such a genuine positive attitude. Everytime I looked up the waitresses instantly looked over to see if I needed something. Even when I walked by to use the restroom they smiled an guided me with a hand gesture! I don't normally leave reviews and I was having a crappy day but I'm thoroughly satisfied!"}
{"text":"Recently craving for ramen and since I was around the area so came drop by for dinner. They have added a new Sesame mille crepes cake for dessert but it costs almost $9 for a piece which is way too overpriced. Also they got this miso black which I don't remember seeing this on their menu before. The broth is good but I found it not as rich as the Tonkotsu black but both are good depends on what your preference. The meats are still very tender with some fat on it which I like. Noodles is also al dente as usual. Overall, this place still able to keep it quality since the beginning. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. I am a Ramen fanatic and I've heard that a Sansotei opened up in the North York area and I have to go try it! They are located on Byng Avenue just off of Yonge Street. I came here around 7pm on a Saturday night and did not have to wait for a table which was great.  There is a sitting capacity of 30 people and the restaurant size is quite small. The lighting and decor is great. The menu is also nice and simple as well.   I ordered the Zangi (Deep Fried Chicken), Gyoza and Tonkotsu Ramen. The Zangi was everything I can expect from fried chicken. Hot, Moist and Tender and served with around 5 pieces. The Gyoza took longer to make as the server told us it would take 15 minutes. One order came with 4 pieces and it was hot and fresh. I believe it is worth ordering if you are not in a rush. Finally, the Tonkotsu Ramen! I chose thick noodles. The broth was not salty at all and complements the pork belly slices well which were tender. The egg was tasty and looked great as the yolk was a little bit runny. Great ramen overall.   To top it off, I ordered the Sakura Crepe Cake from Millie Creperie. I found it cool that they have a partnership together. The crepe cake was not sweet and it was light in flavour and texture.  Service was amazing too!   Why 4.5 stars though? The only bad thing if you don't live in the area is finding parking. Parking is a pain in this area as it's all paid street parking. It took some time for me to find a spot at all! They claim that they have free parking but I have to try it out when I go back.  Overall, a great new Ramen place opened up here in the North York area."}
{"text":"I ordered to Tonkatsu ramen with original noodle. The soup base is creamy and well seasoned. The noodle is just typical ramen noodle. I also orders the seaweed salad which is well seasoned and really fresh.   I will recommend ordering those items"}
{"text":"Simple menu, good prices, great quality, friendly service. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Very good ramen, especially on this chilly night! The black garlic oil really took the tonkotsu broth to another level. Very rich broth and great chew on the noodles. The fried chicken appetizer was also very tasty."}
{"text":"It's an \"okay\" place for ramen. It's probably the only decent place in Markham. Service is fast, which is normal for a ramen place. Noodles are chewy and delicious, soup is tasty but it doesn't have that 'rich' flavour. I like their beef gyu don a lot; but their gyoza could be better. For Markham standards I think this place will pass definitely. For the reason of accessibility and lots of parking space, I would come back."}
{"text":"I've tried my share of ramen joints in the city and this one doesn't disappoint.  They have a good variety of different soups without being too overwhelming with options -  my favourites being the miso black and spicy tan tan.  I appreciate their recommendation of which noodle to eat for each dish but I tend to enjoy the thick noodle best.  The sides are simple but delicious - you can never go wrong with the zangi (chicken Karaage Hokkaido style).   In the 9 times I've been here to date, never once did I encounter bad service. It's fast and friendly.  The only downside is that the restaurant is small so if you're coming at a peak time (which is almost all day everyday) mostly likely you will have to wait in line outside (Brr!).  I typically go no later than 30 minutes after it opens for a guaranteed seat upon arrival."}
{"text":"Miso Black and Tonkotsu Black are very good.  I visited Toronto for a 5-day conference and my wife and I went to Santotei for every days for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Not a lot of selection and the portion is a little small for its price. The floor is a bit sticky which makes me feel the whole place is not very clean."}
{"text":"Miso Black with Thick Noodles !!!  The first time I was here a few years ago - it was the best ramen I've ever had. That was a life-changing experience that changed my outlook on ramen. The few times I've gone since though, it hasn't quite lived up to that first taste. It's still really delicious, don't get me wrong! The broth is so flavourful but not so rich that you can't gulp it down. You have to finish all the broth, that's how good it is."}
{"text":"Probably the best ramen I've had in Toronto. People waited 15 minutes in the cold Toronto weather to have a bowl of this ramen-that's how you know it's worth it.   I ordered tonkatsu black and my friend ordered miso. I ordered an egg because I didn't know they came with one already! Something a lot of ramen places do not have (...KINTON...). Very nice ramen, the noodles were great and thin, soup was delicious and thick and eggs were perfect (one was a bit cold but it was alright). Maybe they could add some bamboo shoots and seaweed for more flavour but that's just me.   For ten bucks you can get yourself a great bowl of ramen. Would come again, drank all the soup!"}
{"text":"Sansotei  FOOD:4 stars TLDR: Regular tonkotsu ramen- amazing! Tomato base mushroom tame- not as amazing.  I've had the same ramen before but from the location in downtown and it was amazing. Its needless to say i just have to try it now since its much closer!  The food is great, price is decent as far as ramen goes, love the fact that i get the whole egg. Most places give you half an egg only. The pork belly is decent but i personally still like the ones at kinton more. The soup base is great as well, rich in pork flavor. Yum We also order the tomato base ramen, which was slightly disappointing to me, no really a huge fan of that. The mushrooms in the ramen tastes great but that's about it.  I think sticking with the original ramen is the safest way to go.  ----------  SERVICE: 5 stars TLDR: Great service, warm smile, and very approachable   The servers clearly knew what they were doing. We had multiple questions to which she answered quickly and nicely. She was really nice , composed, and had a great smile despite the restaurant being extremely busy. As we finished, as opposed to rudely kicking us out, just helped us clean the plates when we finished, and waited for us to ask for the bill. I just want to say that experience can be easily attained by working more, but work ethics and a genuine smile just doesn't come with everyone, and personally, if i had to choose between the two, i'd choose the latter.  ----------  LOCATION/AMBIANCE: 4 stars TLDR: New modern japanese vibe.  The place is newly decorated with a modern japanese motif to it. Clean, simple and a very nice vibe to spend an evening in.  There aren't a lot of small individual tables though, so be prepared to have to sit on opposite side of the same table with someone. ------------  PARKING: 4 stars  Located in 3987 hwy 7, just east of warden in this newly built plaza. There's tons of parking spots in the plaza. Its also located very close to the enterprise cineplex, so it'd be a great place to dine before your movie nite!  ----------  PRICE: 4 stars  Not excessively cheap, just the medium price range you'd expect from almost all other ramen store."}
{"text":"There is a queue. We didn't try to call and reserve we are not sure if they allow that. Food is tasty tried the Tonkotsu Black with extra thick noodles. Heavy and filling. Place is not ideal for big groups. The resto is too small.   You know what -- the noodles: very fresh ;  soup: very tasty. Per Canadian standards, this place carries Flavour."}
{"text":"A nice solid bowl of black sesame/garlic oil ramen. Everything on the menu is safe. Decent service time.  One major complaint that's absolutely outside their control is the horrid lineup. Be prepared to line up on the streets in winter if ya came late. This place is popular for weekends and dinners."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday afternoon around 4:30pm and was pretty empty. We had no trouble getting a seat for three. They had really solid ramen with super flavourful broth. The ramen noodles has really good bounce and not over cooked. The service is also really fast and prompt."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ramen in town! Order the tonkotsu ramen and enjoy. They serve beer as well, and food is really cheap. Been back many times - a go to place. Mind the lines, though. It can get pretty busy since it is very close to the university and dorm area."}
{"text":"I frequent Sansotei on Yonge and am a big fan of their ramen because of the rich flavorful broth. Well I stopped in for lunch on Tuesday at the Dundas West location since the Yonge locale was closed. I ordered my usual Tonkotsu Black and when I took that first sip, my taste buds said \"WTF,  I don't remember ordering the Dead Sea ramen!\". I could only eat the noodles/toppings and left most of the salt laden broth behind. Eating ramen without a good soup base is less than satisfying. I did tell the server before leaving and she did say she will pass it onto the kitchen....hopefully.  The cooks at the Yonge location thankfully are not so heavy handed with the seasoning.  You would think a chain like this would all follow the same recipes, go figure."}
{"text":"You haven't had good Ramen until you've stood outside in a line up, in -30 degree weather waiting for said good ramen - henceforth, this was very good ramen.  Located near Dundas and University (just a touch west of Chestnut) this tiny little best in class ramen joint is pumping out the noodle soup faster than Campbells can. The signage isn't very noticable, so a line up is actually lucky as it will save you from walking past (if you've never been before).   The restaurant is long and narrow and maybe seats 30-40 guests. The turnover is pretty quick so at worst you'll wait 10-20 minutes for a table. Once seated I had already taken the time to peruse Yelp and knew exactly what I was having... the same thing pretty much everyone else orders the Tonkotsu Ramen, with extra pork belly. The only exception was I decided to start with an order of the Zangi (fried chicken bites) to share with my dc.   The ramen was quick and came out 5 minutes before the chicken - i didn't mind. The milky warm falvourful broth (which still makes me salivate while I recount my experience) was hot and melted the chill right off my bones.  The zangi was the perfect sharable side to go along with the main as it complimented the flavours and didn't take away or overpower my reason for being there.  My one and ONLY complaint was that we were seated right near the front and we had to eat our soup faster to avoid having it go cold- many people near us had decided to keep their winter coats on. I think a double door or flaps blocking the cold might be a good idea to consider.  Overall a great experience, wonderfully friendly staff, cheap prices, uber fast service and beyond tasty food! Can't wait for my next ramen craving!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Damn good ramen! Whoever told me food in Toronto is better than NY was not kidding.  I got the Tonkotsu Ramen and aside from being a little salty, it's delish! The broth is rich in flavor-I'm guessing pork, miso and eggs.  Thank you very much Toronto-I'm getting fat on this trip!!"}
{"text":"So cold in Toronto. So nice to have ramen.  This was a new joint that we tried. It seemed to focus on noddle choices.  * Tonkotsu Ramen with choice of Sansotei Ramen Noodles - the broth was not bad. However, the ramen I chose was different then any I tried in California. It was a little more chewy and had more bounce to it. It was different and it tasted good. I would try this place again when back in Toronto Downtown."}
{"text":"Very authentic Japanese ramen! I ordered tomato, friends ordered tonkustuo black; both are yummy! Special compliment to the soup base of Tomato ramen. I chose thin noodles for my ramen, very chewy! Service is friendly and outstanding. I will definitely come back for the comfort food!!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place as I was sick, tired, and hungry.  I saw ramen, and thought, yup, this will bring me back to health.  A touch more expensive and smaller portioned than other ramen places, but I think it's worth it.  There's a deeper quality to the food here, and I'd go back if I were in the area.  Or, try other places since this corner has so many."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favorite ramen place thus far. I've tried multiple locations of kinton, kenzo, santouka, and some other ramen shops in the suburbs.   I LOVED the spicy braised soft chicken wings!  The broth I got was great. I asked for very little salt and very little lard, and it's exactly what I got! When I asked for \"less salt\" at santouka the broth was still really salty."}
{"text":"Came to this place on Sunday, they were closed, came back during lunch on Monday.   It was very good. I ordered the tonotsu ramen, the broth alone worth 5 stars. The noodles were amazing, pork belly was tender and full of flavour. I ordered extra pork and egg, it was worth it. I would come back again, this is indeed the best ramen place I'm Toronto."}
{"text":"Location/Service - Along Byng, street parking available and along on Yonge St as well - Restaurant easy to spot, as it has has big windows from top to bottom - Bring lightning, similar decor to their other locations (seating available by bar and high-table) - Staff are friendly and nice, quick to deliver  Food - I find their soup bases at this location a lot better compared to the Markham one - It's less fatty, and a lot stronger  - Tried their tonkatsu with thick noodles - Everything was done to the right level in terms of noodle elasticity, meat was sufficient and cooked to the right level - Overall experience was consistent and similar to their first downtown location  This spot is great for people living in the area, perfect place to grab a bite on a rainy day. Line up is not bad either cause they have more seating available. Definitely will swing by when I'm in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"The Order: Miso Black Ramen with Extra Noodles (Thick)  This is the most expensive order on the menu at only 13.50 , and it tastes great! Not too salty (although my wife had the thin noodles and hers was saltier).  The tiny mushrooms in here taste so so great. Great texture, marinated and just plain yummy!  I tried both the thick and thin noodles, and I have to say that the thin held the soup flavor better, but the thick had a nice chew to them.  Although the menu reads that this bowl of ramen should have \"spicy flavor\", I didn't taste any spice at all which was a bit disappointing.  Pork meat was good, but I prefer a more marinated chashu.  Overall a great ramen, and definitely will be back to try more! Price point makes this place absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tonkotsu Black and it was delicious. The broth was the amazing. But be prepared to wait outside regardless of the time or weather because the place is super tiny and very popular."}
{"text":"second time coming here for the Tonkatsu ramen with black garlic oil.First visit, ramen was good ,dente.Broth authentic.  Today after eating there, 2 persons in our group felt the broth was super \"salty\" and developed  dry mouths and thirst, which lasted for a few hours despite water and tea.  Suspects are salt and MSG, take your pick Wont be back for a third time."}
{"text":"Sansotei finally moved up to Markham - perfect for ramen lovers who don't go to downtown on a regular basis.  This restaurant is a lot bigger compared to the one on Dundas.  It even has larger tables (probably for a group of 6 to 8), so it's good if you have a gang of ramen lovers coming to try.    The hype is still there from the last time I went - so there is a bit of a waiting time (30min to 1hr) depending on the day.  So prepare yourself, especially with the cold weather coming.    The food, however, is still top notch.  Excellent broth - especially it's original Tonkotsu.  It's rich, but not heavy that leaves you an after taste.  They have a choice of thin or thick noodles.  You can ask the staff which one suits for which flavor.  The pork (or cha siu) is fat, but made just right - juicy and soft.    Remember to try their fried chicken as well - it's not overly fried; very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside."}
{"text":"No doubt the best ramen restaurant in Toronto, the food is amazing and is worth the wait. My personal favorite is Tonkotsu black thin noodles, the garlic and the broth perfectly balance each other. If you don't like the garlic oil, Tonkotsu is good as well!  The staff is amazing and their service is undeniably the best; they know when you're going to order and when to refill your water even during peak hours. Another thing that I like is that they would never bother you as well unless you're done eating.   Washrooms are very well-maintained; if there was any problem you can ask a staff and they will fix it asap.  Overall experience is amazing, I think the only downside is waiting outside in the cold during peak hours, but that doesn't' take out the 5 star of this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you come here during weekday lunch, you will very likely have a wait as the restaurant is both popular and tiny. The menu is fairly limited, but what they do, they do well. This was some of the best ramen of my life! I got the black miso ramen; the flavors were so rich and the pork was tender, the eggs were perfectly cooked with slightly runny yolks. I added some chili powder to spice it up, but it was perfect otherwise. Make sure to choose the thick noodles!"}
{"text":"Best ramen place in Toronto! Taste is always consistent."}
{"text":"We were lucky to be able to get in and have a quick meal without having to queue! Ordered the spicy tan tan ramen and miso black ramen! I love the soup base for both. Very flavorful but not overpowering. The egg was soft and jelly like, super love it! The noodles were alittle tough and could have been better. The pork was tender, crispy and juicy! Portions were just right for us too, not too much or little. Perfect for a cold weather too"}
{"text":"Best ramen in the city IMO. Tonkatsu Black never ceases to amaze. The typical wait on the sidewalk just adds to the anticipation (as long as it's just a few people ahead, you won't have to wait too long). Spicy tantan also excellent."}
{"text":"I always come here & always tipped well. The food is always great and I even brought a bunch of people to come try this place before but today is what pissed me off. The worker who took my order barely understood what I was saying. Each of the ramen was suppose to come with an egg. I asked for an extra egg on the side that I will pay for but instead when 2 of our ramen came out there was no egg. On top of that I had to wait quite a while for the other two bowl and by the time I got it two of the people I was with was basically done eating. The whole time I was eating I noticed the guy worker kept on staring and laughing and talking shit. Not only did I noticed, but my whole family did. When it was time to pay for the bill my mom wanted to handle it. She never been here before so she thought tip was included which it wasn't. When the lady took our money that same guy looked at how much we paid and was standing there shaking his head and looking at me. If he had a problem he could've just said something but instead while we got dressed and was walking out that's when he stopped us and asked for tip. I don't even know why he asked for tip from us because he wasn't even our server. I usually tip good if the service was good but I felt uncomfortable the whole time I was eating there so why would I want to tip. This pissed me off that I had to make a Yelp account just to write this review."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite ramen in Toronto!  The line here can be crazy. We came at 6:30 pm and waited 50 minutes. The hostess was really nice though and checked in with the customers every 5-10 minutes.  The space is very cramped inside. I would not suggest going with more than four people. It would take forever for a seat. Tables are communal style so you can be sitting in front of a stranger if you come with odd numbers. Turn around is very fast though.  We tried he spicy tantan, tonkotsu and tonkutsu black. All were great! My favourite was the tonkotsu black. The soup bases seemed to be the same except for the different oils that went ontop. I didn't mind though since their soup was amazing! The tonkotsu black had garlic oil ontop. That made the bowl so much fragrant. Just the aroma of it on that first bite is enough to sell you!!  I will be back :) maybe in the middle of the afternoon next time so I won't have to wait as long"}
{"text":"I much prefer the downtown location but I guess that is what happens when there are franchises. The quality is very different, its as if the two restaurants weren't even related other than having the same menu items.  We ordered the tonkotsu and shoyu. Both broths were just decent. Definitely not as creamy, thick and savoury as the downtown location. In fact, they tasted pretty watered down. Noodles felt undercooked. The noodles should be chewy, but not hard. The ramen was just disappointing.  I also ordered the matcha cheesecake. Maybe it just was not what I imagined it to be. It turned out to be a really dense cheesecake. I was hoping for soft, moist, japanese cheesecake. It was really dense, like something made out of diluted philadelphia cream cheese..  Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here on multiple occasions now because it's such a convenient location - super close to Finch station! Faithful to the Sansotei chain, this location serves the same simple menu with great quality.  The staff is attentive and patient, and are well trained to provide consistent answers and reliable service all the time.  For those seeking a classic, I recommend their Tonkotsu ramen with thick noodles. Their pork belly is sometimes quite fatty so it's a luck of the draw kind of thing, but on average it has been a good portion and tasty. Their pork broth is rich but not too oily.   For a twist, go for the tomato! The fresh scallop adds a very different flavour and the tomato soup (note: which is actually still pork based broth!) is rich.  Their zangi and gyoza complement the ramen bowls very nicely and are not too expensive, thought there's a bit of wait for the gyoza and the zangi portion isn't very large.  If you're looking for a budget-friendly meal under $20, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I've never had legit ramen and maybe can't compare much but daaamn! So, so good. Being a newbie my friend recommended I get the classic Tonkotsu. This was so the broth wouldn't be too heavy, oily, spicy, or overly flavourful, so I could gauge how I like it. And it did not disappoint! The meat was tender, the egg was soft, and the broth was flavourful and delicious. I will definitely be going back to experiment further! The venue is also cozy and nice (although small) and the service was friendly and very quick."}
{"text":"The ramen and karaage chicken were fantastic, just what you need on a cold Toronto night. The food came out quickly and waiters were attentive. The only downside is the restaurant was very small and we had to wait outside in the snow for a table (about a 10-15 minutes wait), the waiters were very apologetic about the wait."}
{"text":"A tiny little place with a powerful statement in flavor. Had the Tonkatsu Black. The broth was thick and packs plentiful flavor. Service was prompt as it was near closing time when I was seated. Staff was very friendly and I was a bit surprised that they kept their smiles every time I look up as it was the end of the night when people are typically tired. The only thing I didn't fancy was that the washroom was 4 ft in front of me. Good thing nobody had any belly disagreement. Like I said...tiny place."}
{"text":"I think I've found my new favourite ramen place in Toronto! Dropped by for dinner (around 8PM). As a party of 4, we had to wait outside for about 20 minutes to get in. The place itself is quite narrow and small, so I wouldn't recommend this for groups larger than 4.  I ordered the tomato ramen with thin noodles and extra egg, and I highly recommend it! I've been to other ramen places *cough* kinton *cough* where the broth was way too salty for me - the tomato ramen is flavourful and does not have too much salt! The pork slices were great, not too fatty. The portion sizes were perfect, and left me feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Not as savory as before... the noodles were lacking this time..."}
{"text":"I would say it's a very classic ramen restaurant. I love tonkatsu soup more than miso and shiyo soup. However, it's nothing surprised. If you are looking for somewhere to have a quick and not bad meal with reasonable price, then it is the place."}
{"text":"This is one of the best ramen places I've tried in the city! Come during non-rush hours so you don't have to suffer the long waits that many are commenting about.   I got the black miso ramen with thick noodles, without pork belly and kakuni. I substituted these with black fungus, corn, and bamboo shoot. My dish also had delicious shiitake mushrooms and a garlic oil. Keep in mind that all the broths are made with pork bone, so there's absolutely no vegetarian option! Overall, I really enjoyed my ramen - the broth was incredibly flavorful, with a filling amount of noodles and veggies. I've tried other ramen places where the broth seriously lacks in flavor.   At $13.50 for my ramen, the prices compare to other ramen places but you get a better tasting experience here. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they don't have vegetarian or chicken broth."}
{"text":"The ramen shop chain's Markham branch brings the same flavours as its downtown locations. Sunday evening was crowded so be sure to arrive early and expect about 15-20min wait time. Fortunately the food is quick, and patrons move along just as quickly. The Tonkotsu Black ramen featured a flavourful garlic oil addition to the pork broth - the recommendation to all garlic fans. The pork pieces were tender and not too salty, the soft-boiled egg had the right jellied yolk consistency, and the thick ramen noodles were chewy and satisfying. The broth contains most of the flavour, which was intensified with the garlic oil kick."}
{"text":"if you are looking for a good Ramen this is a place to be. I had Spicy Tan Tan (thin noodle) with extra chashu and it was excellent. Just right amount of spiciness in the soup made a great harmony with thin noodle. If you are unsure of what to order I recommend Spicy Tan Tan.   Please note that this place is not a kids friendly place with no high chairs. Most of the tables are high with tall chairs.   The restaurant is small and tables are designed for sharing so if you have a small party you should expect to share a table."}
{"text":"Always good to have more ramen options in Markham but I have to say that the downtown Sansotei is a lot better - both food quality and service. Still satisfies the odd ramen craving though.  When I come here I usually get the tomato ramen with thin noodles. It was always served with mushrooms, a tomato, pork, and a giant scallop in the past but on my most recent visit the scallop was gone and replaced with a giant shrimp instead! Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"The place is very ambient and spacious, neat and clean like fresh your mind.  A moderate place to have lunch or dinner with friends and family. You may enjoy your valuable time on here with your best person as well. Food decoration was pretty nice.  I'm selected this restaurant in my best list. Thanks for great service.!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of our \"go to\" ramen spots. The reason the 5 star is not obtained is because of their limited seating that can make the wait longer than desired.  I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with a spider order of Zangi chicken and Seaweed salad. My friend ordered the Black Tonkotsu.   Everything was delicious - although I would not order the seaweed salad in the future...small portion for $5...not worth it by my estimation.  Their broth is spectacular!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in Toronto. Plain and simple. They have edible flowers, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Came on the second day of opening and even though it was supposed to open at 5pm, they were running late and opened at 6pm. An hour wait was brutal.   Waitresses didn't know what they were doing. Food was very oily and heavy. They didn't have any gyozas that day which sucked.   Don't order the chicken zangi unless you like eating oil.  Their Dt location is way better."}
{"text":"Tried the black fungus ramen and fried chicken. Our order came within 10 minutes. Fried chicken wasnt anything special, but the ramen was something else. The noodles were chewy and the soup was delicious! Very similar to kinton as well.    There was no wait time when i arrived with my friend(8pm or so) however, spaces are very tight. We shared a table with a large group, which wasnt too bad if you consider everyone else is doing the same. But I do wish there was more space on the table since it felt as though my bowl was clashing with my friends. Other than that, the place has food quality food and decent service.  Would visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Toronto! Very flavourful. The spicy tantan or tonksotu black are my fav. Great environment and servers too. Service is really fast."}
{"text":"Compared to my experiences at Ajisen, Niwatei and Kenzo, I would say that this is my favourite ramen place so far. I went on a Saturday around lunch time, and there was a line, where I waited about 20 minutes. I ordered the basic tonkotsu ramen along with a side of gyoza. I think that despite being slightly pricier, you do pay for the quality of the food you're getting. For example, the ramen comes with a generous serving of unchopped good quality black fungi, which is slightly pricy, so most ramen places actually either slice the black fungi into thin slivers, or don't serve it at all. In addition, most ramen places only offer half a egg, while Sansotei offers a full egg. In addition, the egg is also well marinated AND softboiled, whereas the other ramen places either offer marinated hardboiled eggs, or under flavoured softboiled ones. In terms of the soup base, it was deliciously rich, and as I drank it I didn't feel like I was drinking MSG like at Ajisen. Also, unlike other yelpers I didn't find that the richness made the soup hard to finish towards the end, but maybe my body just processes grease well :) . For the tonkotsu or pork belly, it was a generous portion, and had a nice smokey flavour to it which I haven't been able to find at the other ramen places I've tried.   In terms of the gyoza, I was happy to see that it wasn't the deep fried kind which you find at most Japanese restaurants, but rather the nice homey, pan fried types. (Though admittedly a bit pricey for 4 pieces). They were yummy, but quickly gone. (Side dishes are pricey in general and come in pretty small portions)  Overall, I think Sansotei was a good ramen experience, and I would definitely return. However, as my boyfriend wisely puts it, this restaurant is either worth the wait or the price, not both. I am willing to pay the price for quality food, but the place hasn't quite blown my mind yet for me to wait in line during cold weather. I recommend coming during the weekdays where they would presumably be less busy."}
{"text":"Small little place. Noticed many people at tables around us didn't finish their ramen. So its either the portions were to large for them or the noodles weren't that great. As a total fan of Ramen and have ate many, its sad to say I have had way better. A true yummy delicious ramen should have very potent and strong pork bone broth flavor. Also a true yummy broth are boiled so long that some boil them for over 24hrs to get that full bodied flavor and some places, you can almost smell that potent flavor as you walk in the door.    My husband ordered the Tonkotsu and I ordered the Tonkotsu black. Since mine is more flavorful I tasted his first. First impression, boy is it salty and could barely taste the broth. Therefore our take is it reminds us of ajisen ramen. In order to enhance the stronger (bone) broth flavor that it lacks, add more salt or MSG (IF they use any MSG. Don't know the regulations here in Canada. Mines was even more salty but had much more flavor due to the black garlic oil in it.  I asked the waitress if I could have a cup of hot water. When she returned, she asked me if it was for drinking or for adding into my soup. I was surprised she noticed. Either she is very observant since I did have ice water too and she finds it odd I then asked for hot OR I must not be the first to request for hot water to dilute the saltiness in the soup. The ramen is not too bad but different from the ones im used to eating. I prefer the more yellow and curlier (true ramen) kind. Thats just me though.  Service: So when I told her it was to dilute soup, she offered me a small bowl of just the base tonkotsu broth to add into my soup instead of water. I was so happy! I tasted the broth alone and I tasted the bone broth much more in it and had no salt at all. Love it! Although this way...it was true the bone wasn't boiled as long as it should and to make up for it, needed lots of salt. When I added to my soup it, loved it much more. We both finished our ramen! So if she was being observant, good for her! If I'm not the first to request, then they should take it as a hint.   To the owner: I loved my soup much more when you gave me the unsalted broth to add to my soup which both my husband and I loved our bowl of soup much more. So a suggestion is maybe you guys can start modifying your menu and give options to customers to have little salt, medium salt or regular. Just a thought."}
{"text":"Recommend going early because the lineup gets long very quickly. The pork belly and egg were delicious. Only complaint is the seating arrangement. They only have long tables so everyone is basically sharing a table with several other parties. Not recommended for a first date since there's very little privacy in conversation and it gets quite noisy. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Ever since I fell in love with Ippudo in Japan, I had been looking for a Hakata style Ramen place in Toronto and soon discovered Sansotei. Unless you get lucky, you'll likely have to wait for a table, but believe me when I say it is worth every minute. Don't know what to order? Go for the Tonkotsu Black. What you'll get is amazing, porky goodness in a bowl; and each spoonful of milky, pork-bone tonkotsu feels like an impossibly sublime deliverance into deliciousness. Seriously, it's like that every time. Japanese soul food it it's finest and definitely one of the top Ramen spots in the city."}
{"text":"After several attempts, I finally gave Sansotei a try. We were lucky enough to only have waited 5 minutes for a table of two at around 6:30pm or so on a Friday evening.   I've had ramen at several ramen places around the downtown core but none of them can compare to the ones you get in Japan. With that being said, I thought Sansotei was one of the best I've had in Toronto.   We ordered the Tonkotsu Black and the Spicy Tan Tan with thick noodles. The broth of both of the ramens were very flavourful but not overwhelmingly heavy. The spicy tan tan had a good mixture of spice and peanut flavour which was what I liked about it.   The waitress was very friendly but not overly attentive. Overall, this is one of my favourite ramen places in Toronto. This was a perfect meal on a cold fall/winter night."}
{"text":"I've tried the downtown location and the Markham one is pretty comparable. I had the Tonkotsu Black with thick noodles. I thought it was a good portion but for my liking a little bit too salty. The other members of my party got the spicy tan tan and it looked pretty delicious too. It just isn't my cup of tea as I don't take spice well but if you can handle a bit of spice, I would recommend it!  Nice addition uptown in Markham."}
{"text":"the ramen at this place is like spaghetti and the broth is alright however it's sort of bland. the dumplings also seemed to be store bought and definitely not fresh. service was okay but took some effort to get a waiter to your table and the $2 for tea definitely doesn't help. it's also really expensive for the small portion and quality. overall, i wouldn't come back and there's other ramen shops in Markham with better quality and prices."}
{"text":"Ramen has recently been a hippy pop-up trend and long gone are the days of Kenzo (sorry Kenzo - you are now the McDonalds of ramen). I am no Ramen expert butI've been recently on a solo ramen adventure and have frequented Sansotei as part of the anecdotal big 3 1) Sansotei 2) Santouka 3) Kinton.   The only downside is the small capacity and the need to wait outside. However once inside, the atmosphere is also a bit quieter compared to the hustle and bustle of  Kinton The seating is also a little odd - since they have no solo bar seats, you might have a rando sitting communally at your table or if you're a solo enthusiast like me, have your smartphone ready.  I see that they are expanding to Yonge and Bloor, and I can't wait as that location will be much closer! Hopefully they will be more strategic with the seating plan.  I do keep coming back to Sansotei mainly for a couple reasons. I always order the Tonkatsu Ramen with extra pork. I love how it automatically comes with an egg (most places charge you) - and the extra pork gives you an extra 2 slices to 4 from the regular. Although traditional ramen is more like the thick yellow squiggley - I like how Sansotei offers the long white ramen as the original and I do enjoy this variation. it is a white creamy broth that is delicious without being overpowering. I find a touch lighter than the tonkatsu at Kinton which I find greasier. .I also prefer the broth at Sansotei as I find the Santouka one a bit too salty. The pork Chashu is just right - I find that it is not too fatty compared to the pork belly at Kinton and is very flavourful and tender. The black fungus/mushroom added some texture and crunch.  Overall, I really enjoy the Sansotei ramen and I find it is a nice balance between broth, noodle, and pork. It is a light bowl of ramen with a lovely Tonkatsu broth and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Brother and I dropped in while we were in town. - Huge hello shouted by everyone as you walk in - quick service - friendly - knowledgeable - when I said it was our first time the service offered great advice.  - food was amazing  Clean and cool, Urban-Chic atmosphere.  Perfect experience!"}
{"text":"This is a great ramen place when you're on the go in downtown Toronto.  The broth and noodles are great and the appetizers are nice and filling.  There is a nice ambiance to this place although it is full most of the time.    Despite the line ups and long wait this place is a great ramen noodle house with good service and friendly staff.  It is a staple in Japanese noodles in toronto like Kinton, Kenzo and Momofuku.  Definitely one of my top places to eat when it comes to ramen!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. We ordered the tonkotsu black and spicy tan tan ramen with thick noodles (I know, I know, thin noodles are the REAL way). The broth was very rich and flavourful, although a tiny bit on the salty side for my liking, and deliciously garlicky (tonkotsu) and spicy (tan tan). The service was quick and professional. I'm definitely glad they opened a location in Richmond Hill and I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've only tried the tonkotsu with the regular noodle.  I'm curious to try the thin and the thick versions too.  The broth here is very flavourful.  Creamy pork flavour, no chunks of fat floating around (like a certain other place...)... and adding extra veggies is only 50 cents each.  I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"So seeing the high ratings, the place seemed very professional and of excellent quality. When you walk in there are long high tables and they seat you in a very efficient manner next to other customers. People who are used to separated tables may find the seating arrangement and restaurant layout uncomfortable.   Waiters are kind and greet you loudly on your way in. Atmosphere seems casual and relaxed.   Decor and interior design done very well and looks overall pleasing and beautiful.   Portions of ramen are perfect not too full but not left hungry- very tasty but a little too salty. Then again ramen is typically salty. Fast service and order was taken and delivered within 10-15 minutes.  Definitely coming again and 100% would recommend. However coming in large groups may not be a good idea (4+ people) and seating arrangements can be very annoying as you are squished with other customers and no bag/coat room."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0  Decent authentic Japanese ramen joint finally finds itself uptown. My go-to ramen is their Tonkatsu Black with thick noodles. Their pork belly cooking process needs to be more consistent as sometimes they're a bit overdone and dry while other pieces are just right.  Some folks may find the soup base a bit heavy handed in the salt department. Recommend to request a low sodium version if that's the case, especially if you plan on getting the spicy tan tan."}
{"text":"I was here for the second time on Monday after eating here for the first time quite a while ago and was pleasantly surprised to see that the quality had not gone down from when it first opened. Usually there is a lineup but at 7 pm on a Monday, they seated us immediately. Although the menu is not very large, I think they change it up every now and then to give some variety. Both myself and my date ordered the tonkotsu black with thick noodles and it was delicious! Our food arrived quickly and the service was very polite and friendly. It's a bit pricey for a bowl of noodle soup but definitely worth it (especially for me since I will pay pretty much anything for delicious carbs in savoury broth :) ). Will definitely be returning for my fix of ramen."}
{"text":"Plenty of other reviews on this place, and yes you want the \"black tonkatsu-\" tonkatsu, but with black garlic oil added for more flavor! Not that the broth needs more flavor, it doesn't. But is a quite tasty. The noodle are perfectly cooked, a pleasantly chewy al dente. I also tried the side of crispy chicken. Very tasty, came out steaming hot, with a lemon wedge. Maybe a dipping sauce would be a nice addition, and help cool it down just perfectly.  I'll leave you with this thought: Like a good tv series that has you hooked, when you reach the end/bottom of the bowl, you just want more. ;)"}
{"text":"Thick delicious soup that blends in with their chewy soup noodle. Simply delicious. There should be a Sansotei in Vancouver.   Haven't had a bad bowl of ramen here yet."}
{"text":"The broth is so rich and amazing. Came here with the girlfriend last Thursday after seeing all the awesome yelp reviews. We had never been to a really decent Ramen place and this was it.   Small menu but everything we tasted was very nice. We started with the Zangai chicken wings and then Tonkasu Ramen with Pork Belly, Black Fungus,Egg and Green Onion. I had the Tonkasu Black, with added Garlic Oil. Both kinds were amazing, with a very rich rich broth!"}
{"text":"Ramen is all the rage in here, so it was about time I tried some of the popular joints. While I really wanted to try Santouka, I realized they don't have a tsukemen dish yet so I decided to go with an option that doesn't yet exist in vancouver: Sansotei.  Brother and I got here right at 5pm on a Thursday and we just missed the last available table! By the time some space cleared up, there was enough people lining up behind us to easily fill up 2/3s of the place (craziness!). Definitely small, so try to go during off times or be prepared to wait. This advice is crucial during the winter, when you have to wait outside.   Despite the fact that a few groups after us were parties of 3 or 4, we got the first available table, which was a booth spacious enough for them. Seemed a strange algorithm of seating people, but I guess FIFO is always the default. I like ramen menus in general because the selections are sparse. It's soup noodles, the more choices you give me the more confused I get.   I settled on the shoyu since I love thick broths, and this one did not disappoint. It was smooth and flavourful and had just the right amount of saltiness. My brother got the miso, which is milder in flavour. We also split an order of gyozas and they were ... not up to par. Flavourless (despite the hearty amount of green onions in there), but prepared nicely with a good crispy bottom. I wouldn't order them again.  Otherwise, the meal was good - the prices are decent ($10 to fill you), and service is quick. I wouldn't mind coming here again, but I still have so many other places to try first!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened. TIP - go to their yonge and Wellesey location, generally speaking no wait at all. Why stand out in the cold?!  OK- TONKATSU Ramen my go to staple. Noodles are firm and succulent. AND THE BROTH- AMAZINGGGGG. This is my favourite Ramen joint in Toronto.   TIP- get their fried chicken too. Its the best I have tried.  Not 5 stars- sorry, the seating is always so cramped and uncomfortable. I think you guys should expand!"}
{"text":"Ramen comes out quickly and delicious. Noodles, meat, and the soup broth are mixed together to create harmony in the form of Sansotei's ramen dishes.  This place is usually crowded and is very tight.   Service is great and facilities are spectacularly clean."}
{"text":"First time at a Sansotei location and chose the North York one since it's close to home. We were craving Ramen on a cold day and did not want to go to our usual place near by.   Only street parking is available right in front of the business. The inside is actually big for a Ramen place and we got seated right away as it wasn't that busy yet on a late Friday afternoon. Service was prompt and efficient.   I decided to order the Spicy Tan Tan while the wifey went for the Tonkotsu Ramen. We both ordered the thick noodles. I didn't find it spicy but liked the broth while my wife loved her Ramen.   Portions size is in the smaller end but their Ramen are good. I found it less greasy than other places like (Momo...).   Recommended! Will come back again."}
{"text":"Food - 5 Drinks - 4 (small selection, but bottled beer available) Staff - 5 Service - 5 Décor - 4 (not a lot of seating, shared tables) Atmosphere - 4  Cleanliness - 5 Portion - 4 Price-Point - 5  Must-Tries: - Tonkotsu Black (love the roasted garlic oil) - Chicken Karaage (Zangi)  Perks: - broth is freshly made every day with pork bone - comes with a soft boiled egg - your choice of thin or thick noodles (the menu will recommend which noodle is best for each bowl) - extra toppings can be added at an additional cost - Kaedama (noodle refill) is available  Downer: - patrons must wait outside on the sidewalk for a table - expect to lineup during peak times - the Spicy Tan Tan bowl is while quantity last for the day  Tips: - their dessert is crepe cake from Millie Patisserie   ig: sansoteiramen"}
{"text":"The soup base itself is a bit salty to my taste, but the noodle texture is great! Both thin and thick options were beyond our expectation.  Also love the garlic oil, I think it adds just a bit more depth to the whole dish, though it's a bit too much to drink the soup by itself..   Btw the pork is tender and the eggs are cooked just about right that the yolk is still slightly runny. Though we've had better ramen, but overall it didn't let us down :)"}
{"text":"This spot honestly has the best ramen for downtown. The broth is delicious and you get options for different types of broth  too. staff is very friendly and the service is pretty fast. The only downside is that it is small so you may have to wait for a table for awhile and because it's small you have to line up outside, which in the winter isn't the greatest."}
{"text":"This is by far the best ramen in the city.  The Spicy Tantan Ramen with thin noodles and extra noodles is what I get every single time. It includes a generous helping of noodles, ground pork, one piece of pork belly, and a moderately spicy broth. It costs $11.98 after tax, and this is considerably less expensive than the other nearby ramen restaurants. Students will love the savings.  Bonus marks for the extras. They don't stuff the bowl with vegetables such as bean sprouts, but instead give you a modest amount that you can mix in with your soup. Sansotei is also the only ramen place that includes an egg with the bowl! You have to pay for the egg at every other place. When you consider that Sansotei is less expensive even with the egg, it's obvious that Sansotei has excellent value.  Of the \"big 3\" ramen joints (Santouka, Sansotei, and Kinton), Sansotei is my pick every single time. The only knock on them is that they're closed on Sundays. One last thing to note is that their noodles are cooked more on the tender side, so if you prefer the harder noodles of Santouka or Kinton, you may think these noodles are mushy and overcooked. I like them just fine."}
{"text":"First time here but probably won't come back. 1. The portion is small even we added extra meat and eggs. For a girl like me is barely full.   2. The waitress forces us to leave by giving the bill right after we finished. even we didn't ask for it. The place is not even 50% full why you need to be in hat guru to kick us out?  3. The soup is REALLY SALTY! Every bite with the soup I felt like I'm drinking salt water..."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge ramen fan but this ramen place is something I don't mind and quite enjoy! The brother is so smooth and creamy! I'm not sure how they do it but it is definitely flavourful! The staff here are polite and quick with the orders and any other requests. Only problem is that there are no reservations allowed and it is quite small. I don't particularly enjoy the high tables because I'm short and it is annoying to climb up. Other than that, I have no complaints. Will recommend for those who enjoy Japanese ramen."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto my wife wanted some ramen. So of course we got on yelp and saw this place and it had good review so we had to check it out. We had waited in line about 10-15 min but wasn't bad. Overall the Black garlic ramen noodles and the fried chicken was good and their service was great. So glad we tried this ramen joint it made our trip even better."}
{"text":"Best Ramen yet in Toronto.  My friend, who lived in Japan for 4 years dragged me out on a cold night, but there could not have been a better time for a warm bowl of creamy tonkatsu broth, cradling tender slices of pork, earthy black mushrooms, soft but not-too-soft-egg and firm, tasty noodles.  My friend added extra veggies, which is a nice option that I may do next time.   Gyoza were flavourful and ever so slightly crispy on the outside.  Sapporo is the only beer they have and at over $6 a pop, it made this meal expensive, but this clearly is a place to go before drinking :)  I'll definitely be back here when I want some Ramen."}
{"text":"As far as ramen goes, I'm not sure Sansotei is worth the long, long waits. I've been here a few times and I usually get the Spicy Tan Tan. While good, I sort of enjoy Kinton's spicy ramen better.  I've also gotten their Shoyu ramen and that was decent at best.  Overall, decent ramen place but I'm not sure it's worth the long waits."}
{"text":"This place has all sorts of ramen noodles from no spice to mild. The black pepper ramen is one of my favourites and my go to bowl of noodle! You can also add extra noodles which I always go for and for those who love eating noodles, extra noodles does the trick however I still find i can eat more. I leave feeling full but not super full. The spicy tan tan is another great dish and the sauce is spicy so be careful if you are a person who can't handle too much spice. The down side to this is that it can get a bit pricey. All in all, I would still continue going!"}
{"text":"Service For a ramen place, their service is top notch. There is always one person who organizes the line up, she does the following: ensures that you get a ticket (with a number), writes down your party size, tries to get you indoors so you won't freeze to death. I really want to give her a thumbs up because that's a difficult job to do when it's so cold outside (she was wearing a t-shirt, the restaurant needs to buy her a sweater LOL). Anyhow the wait is at least 30 minutes on a Friday night and I swear it was pretty good on the day I was there. Even when you get inside, you are served right away but you do get rushed a bit at the end when you finish your meal. My suggestions: eat SLOW lols. When that waiter/waitress (were they waiters? lols) sees your empty bowl she will be at your side within 1 minute LOL. Keep drinking that soup my friends!  Food I found that the taste was very similar to the downtown one but something was missing. In my opinion, the broth was not hot enough and the eggs were not that runny. I remember biting into the eggs (in downtown) and I felt like it was the best thing on Earth. I could feel the yolk rushing down my throat and squeezing my eyes from the delicious experience. A little exaggeration there but lols. The ramen itself is still not bad but not the same, not the same LOL."}
{"text":"Pretty similar to all other franchise Sansotei Ramen. I found the miso broth was a little too salty but the black was better. This place is good for a smaller portion-comfort food style. We ordered two guida (fried dumplings) but the second one took about 40 minutes to arrive. We asked for it 25 minutes in and they said it was coming out but I believe they just forgot about it because we got it after everyone finished their ramen bowls. Other than that, the service is quick, efficient and polite.  Food definitely has flavour."}
{"text":"Decent ramen, but I didn't think it was really impressive. Ordered extra pork belly but still seems like a regular amount, so I'd hate to see what the normal amount is :(.  Quality:7/10. Service:7/10. Value: 7/10. Overall: 7/10 (not an average)"}
{"text":"When someone tells you that they had the best ramen in all of GTA, you may find it hard to believe with all the variety out there. Usually, most places don't live up to the hype, but Sansotei definitely did!  Came by on a Sunday night as I had heard they line up here was intense! Not quite queuing through the door, but it was close. With a 20-30 minute wait, some may believe it isn't quite worth it, but you will need to be your own judge of that.   I decided to go with the Spicy Slow Cooked Wings and the Tonkotsu Black for my ramen, as it had rave reviews. The wings had an amazing texture and the meat fell right off the bone! Never had that with wings before, so it was easy to eat and definitely a pleasant surprise. However, the wings' seasoning was similar to the braised beef noodle soup you get at other restaurants, without the in-depth flavour. Definitely not worth it in my opinion as it was $6.00 for 5 wings. The ramen was amazing though. Went with the thick noodles and immediately understood why there was a wait. The soup base was flavourful without going overboard. It balanced well with the elements in the bowl, complimenting without overpowering. You could also tell that it wasn't all MSG. The Japanese Tong Sum eggs were made perfectly and the pork belly was wonderful. With the thick noodles not as 'thick' as I was expecting, I was glad I got them over the thin noodles, as the texture and chewiness of the noodles would have changed. For dessert, my friend got the Matcha Cheesecake. Good flavour of matcha, but I personally found the cake too moist, even for a cheesecake... Not my favourite there.  Service was quite good, with the servers all super quick on their feet and tending to their customer's needs right away. Was literally about to ask for more water when she appeared out of nowhere to give me more! Their turnover of tables is quite fast as well, as they make sure their customers aren't waiting too long at the door. The hostess tries to encourage the staff to yell welcome (in Japanese) as she seats people, but it isn't quite done in sync as other staff don't seem to hear it. Could be a more lively environment and nice bonus for customers, but not really necessary.  Was kinda surprised to see that they charged for hot tea though, and it was even more expensive then getting a pop! That would be a bit of a minus in my books.   Definitely going to make my way here again to try out different bowls. They have about 5-6 different options, so I'm already planning my next visit. Hopefully I can figure out a time where it isn't as long of a wait..."}
{"text":"Kind of steep price because I wasn't full from the bowl. Nevertheless, the noodles were chewy and delicious. Also, blowtorched pig belly. Come on... You can't go wrong with that!   If the portions were a bite sized larger, I'd be really happy!"}
{"text":"The waitresses were so kind and polite. But, the food did not meet my expectations. First, the noodles were a bit too hard without the yummy chewiness you should get from Japanese ramen noodles. Second, chashu (pork) slices were way over-cooked without a rich flavor. The broth was good, but the food I had there certainly does not deserve more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Whenever we crave for ramen, we either go here or at Kenzo. Love their tonkotsu black ramen with thin noodles but my ultimate favorite is their plain Tonkotsu Ramen.  The last time we were here we ordered gyoza and crispy chicken. Nothing out of this world but good accompaniments for ramen."}
{"text":"The menu is small, but mighty. I came here last Saturday around 5:45pm as a group of 5, but the restaurant split us up into 2 tables. We waited less than 10 minutes for a table. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen and it was delicious! The creamy broth is what makes their ramen so special. The chasu pork was tender, fresh onions, and the soft egg was cooked just right, including the yolk. They got some speedy cooks in here because we all got our ramen in about 5 minutes after putting in the order.   I must say that seating is limited and this probably isn't the best place to catch up with a friend or to just linger around. People seem to eat and go. The staff members are ok, eager to get you to finish so they can seat the next party.   Restrooms are down a narrow flight of stairs. By the time we left the restaurant around 6:30pm, there was a long line outside. Overall, I'd love to come back again."}
{"text":"THIS place took me by total surprise  Delicious Ramen excellent ingredients cooked to perfection a gem of a place Clean Clean Clean throughout  i just Love this place"}
{"text":"Amazing Ramen, you wait in line outside. Small place. Had black garlic, was great. Traditional tea. Good price."}
{"text":"Solid to go Ramen place. Quick and filing. Usually you have to line up and they pressure you to leave as soon as you are done."}
{"text":"Sansotei is no doubt the best Ramen place in Toronto. You can for sure tell this from the long line outside their front door. Their ramen has rich flavour and is delicious. Two of my favourite ramen would be tonkotsu(pork soup ramen) and tomato (seafood ramen with a scallop) The service is great during every visit."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night snack. Ordered the garlic black noodles, it was tasty and staffs were very friendly."}
{"text":"Best ramen of Toronto but man is this place small!!! Really wanted to try this place but had to wait outside for almost 30 min in the cold.   Taste however trumped everything else. At least for me it seemed worth it. Rich broth but not too rich. Tender pork belly, a good portion. Chewy thick noodles cooked to the right tenderness. Perfectly cooked egg not too runny not too hard. It was a good portion overall, I didn't go home hungry. Although a small restaurant can still sit comfortably. I wished I could get the booths in the back though. Also tried the deep fried chicken, crispy and fresh but the usual stuff. Friendly staff. Will be coming back but maybe during off hours."}
{"text":"Very good Japanese ramen, comparable to those in Japan. Can improve on the pork belly to be softer and chop the spring onions smaller. Already very good in Toronto."}
{"text":"I still consider this a decent place for Ramen.   The prices appear to have increased since they've opened their Markham location.  Service is a bit faster now that it's less busy (at least during my last visit).   The main beef I have with Sansotei is that they are unwilling to accommodate dietary requirements.   I can't eat semi cooked eggs as I am pregnant.  After asking the waiters and managers if they could boil the egg for longer just to ensure it is cook, the response I get is no.  No we cannot change the egg because it's pre-made, no we cannot change it because our store needs to give a certain presentation to the food.   You can give the egg to your husband.     Sorry, those are all BS excuses.  I want protein with my $11 bowl of Ramen dammit.   Unfortunately, they were unable to substitute the egg for extra meat. Instead, I got extra mushrooms.   The first time, I got one piece of shiitake mushroom.   As I mention to the waiters..... Where's my mushrooms, the chef was adamant he put it in there.   Luckily the waiters watched as I scoured the bowl and give me a small handful of extra shiitake mushrooms.     Not a bad place to eat Ramen... However, they're not very accommodating to changes or dietary requests."}
{"text":"I got the black miso ramen. I thought the flavour was decent... I substitute noodles for the Shitakee mushrooms, which I loveeedd.  It was sweet and added great flavour to the ramen. I personally wasn't a fan of the pork that came with it, and I wish there was more spice added to the broth (we asked for extra chilli pepper but the waiters forgot and we didn't ask again).  I also tried the chicken wings... it was a bit too soggy for my liking.  And we tried the fried chicken which was delicious.  I had a sip of the spicy tan tan which def would be the meal i would get next time I come here.  More than anything I loved the cleanliness and interior designing of this place.  High top booths... beautiful lighting created a great ambience.  Def a place to check out for your ramen cravings."}
{"text":"Don't know why there were many bad raps about this location but here are my two cents :  - Food was not that salty as the downtown location (that's already a 4 star ! ) - Service wised its great, very attentive, no complaints - No LLBO yet so no beer although the Sapparo banner was posted inside their store. - Wait time is about 15 mins (Arrived at 9:30pm, 7 tables ahead of us, seated at 9:45pm) - The deep fried chicken was overcooked and overmarinated so will not order next time. - The Green Tea Cheesecake worth to try but its very greasy so its good to share and have a bite instead. - Not good for seniors or families as wait time might  be long and they will get disappointed and irraitated cause they don't like to line up.  We ordered the Original Ramen and The Seafood Tomato Ramen, tasted 4 stars. Again, can taste the flavor but not the heavy sodium as compared to downtown so its a plus plus.  Will visit once again !"}
{"text":"Nice place. Famous franchise.  Kinda of very salty, even though I tried the most regular one."}
{"text":"Definitely giving this place a 5 star review!  This is my first ramen place here in Toronto, and I would say that this place was the best. Me and my friends were hesitant at first to go here since we have to wait. There was a big line up outside when we came, and we waited for at least 15 minutes. BUUUUUUUT! The ramen was definitely worth the wait.  We ordered tonkotsu, tonkotsu black, and shoyu. In my opinion, tonkotsu black was the best.  The price was excellent, we paid only $80 for 7 people.   The servers were super nice, one lady kept on saying sorry since we have to wait for a long time. Then the other lady took our orders calmly. Mostly, if you go to a place where there are always a big line up the servers get very impatient, right? But in here, everyone was calm.   I hope they will try to open up a new place, or make the place extra bigger"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. The Tonkotsu Ramen came with tender pork belly, black fungus and an egg. Everything was rich in taste without being salty. The Tomato Ramen broth was bright and came with a sweet scallop. The Sakura Layered Crepe Dessert was robust in flavour yet delicate in texture; pricey for the portion but a nice treat to split for two."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Service: 4/5 (fast pace: order, enjoy and go) Note: Sunday closed  This is one of the BEST RAMEN places, we came here on Sunday afternoon and glad we came a bit early before the crowd. We ordered Tonkotsu Black and Miso Black with thick noodles, they are DELICIOUS:   Miso Black ($13.50): Tasty Broth: strong flavour Topping: Kakuni (braised pork), a whole soft boiled egg (no extra cost), baby sweet shiitake mushrooms, some leek onion, and flower.   Tonkotsu black (~$11.75): Delicious Broth: Flavourful ,and creamy  Topping: Kakuni (braised pork),  a whole soft boiled egg (no extra cost), black fungus, green onion and with a little touch of garlic oil.   We loved the ramen, it was chewy and thick, with no extra cost for a boiled egg. Be prepared to wait in line during rush hour - this place is as good as it gets!  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, really. This is a decent ramen spot: the soup is rather creamy, noodles and the egg are perfect and the Portion size is more than ok.   However, the pork belly was rather tasteless compared to Kinton and the atmosphere in the restaurant is not really inviting."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had in Toronto. Super fast service, ramen was delicious and the servers are on point! Never had an empty glass of water (says a lot about the service). Gyoza was also delicious, was fried on the spot. 10/10 would come again"}
{"text":"I always like Sansotei because their ramen quality is very consistent with a good price. Soup base is bit salty for most of the ramen on the menu but still tastes good. I guess that is a common issue for most of ramen places. I like their soft boiled egg very much.  However, you only get two pieces of pork belly per bowl which is very little for my standard.  I'll give ramen 4/5 stars.  you always need to line up at this restaurant because of limited space. Also even I haven't finished the noodles, the waitress kept coming and wanted to take away my noodles, which was very impolite to me. They should improve their customer service!"}
{"text":"Ordered a spicy tan tan with thick noodles. Arrived within 10 minutes, but it looked pretty sad. One small piece of half a chashu, a couple pieces of ground pork, a couple slices of bamboo shoots, a handful of noodles, and a whole egg, all for an excellent price of $11.50.  The broth was interesting. The noodles had a nice texture and flavor. Egg was pretty nice, soft-boiled and slowly cooking in your hot soup. Chashu was alright, but way too small. And you'd think they could at least offer more than a dozen pieces of ground pork, given that this particular dish is served in \"limited quantities\" per day perhaps due to the supply of ground pork?  But at the end of the day it's a really small bowl of noodles when you think about it. The place gets busy, so you might be waiting awhile. The place is also small, so even when you get a seat, you'll be seated right next to someone else. Can't really say it's a nice date place either.  I suppose when it comes to ramen, it's quality vs quantity, but at the same time, there are a dozen other chinese, japanese, or vietnamese noodle shops in the area that will offer for the same price more meat, more noodles (some of them unlimited noodles), larger seating spaces, and/or more variety, and for those are just looking for a place to hang out comfortably and chat over tea for an hour or two while enjoying your food at a nice pace, there are better options."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite ramen places in the GTA. I have tried a couple of their ramen, but normally get the tonkatsu black, which is the one I like the most. The broth is flavourful, but quite rich. And the garlic oil and bits are so delicious. Perfect for rainy or cold days!"}
{"text":"I don't care for ramen but I'm thinking it's probably one of the better places for it in toronto.  The soup is what makes it stand out.  SO flavourful, and much better than other places i've been to.     I found the portions to be small and I was still hungry after, but I'm a big eater soooo. Also, there's not enough toppings, but this is a common problem with most ramen places if you don't add anything to your bowl.  I'm greedy what can i say."}
{"text":"First time trying ramen and this place did not disappoint though I really do not have anything to compare it to yet ,but I got a feeling it's gonna be tough since standards may have been set high to start. I ordered the black tonkotsu with thick noodles and extra pork belly. The noodles were just perfect they were firm ,but not tough. The pork belly was just tender enough to hold on the chopsticks , but falls right apart in your mouth. The soup base brought everything together, the noodles, eggs, garlic oil and pork belly into perfect harmony. Too bad I won't be able to try this place again for a long time ,but this experience have now set me in the path to hunt for more ramen!  If your going to try this place make sure your ready to wait outside since inside is pretty tight already. The turn over is fast though so the wait is not too bad. We visited on a Friday night around  6pm and waited outside for about 10min."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tonkotsu Black Ramen from Sansotei. Delicious broth (but really salty) and firm/chewy noodles but next time I'm definitely passing on the black garlic oil. Once mixed in, it tainted my broth with a terrible taste of burnt pan scrapings. Noodle refills at $1.50 a bowl are pretty good. Wait time for a table on a Saturday at 7pm was 15min, food was served within 5 minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"If you like MSG, this Ramen joint is ok. I've tried the black garlic soup base and the spicy soup base. It was tasty but too oily.  Be prepared to drink a  lot of water when the msg kick in. The fried chicken is very tasty though."}
{"text":"This is easily the best ramen place uptown. Good soup.. fresh noodles... tasty meat and side dishes. expect a small or big lineup when you go on prime hours but service is always good and prompt here. The owner and staff does a great job getting people in and out. Compared to most of the ramen restaurant out there in the GTA...this place is solid. Many people complain how this is not as good as the one dt and try to sound like expert food critics..pls save your BS. This is the best you can get up here so take what you can get without having to drive far and shut it. Cheers."}
{"text":"Delicious, friendly, affordable - but not worth a wait.  Go at off hours.  Had a very early lunch and sat right down.  By the time I left there were a dozen people on line outside."}
{"text":"Have been 5 times since it opened, and each time have had to wait-  but it's always been well worth it!   I usually go for the Tonkotsu Black because I absolutely love the extra garlicky flavour from the garlic oil on top.  Thick noodles is a must. The Spicy TanTan is also an amazing choice, when it's available!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was very nice and patient with us as it was our first time there.   Our meal came quick. The food was good overall and reasonably priced. If you like pork belly, definitely spend the extra money and get the extra portion. It melts in your mouth. I had my soup with thick noodles which was cooked al dente. Out table shared an order of fried chicken and gyzos both were good."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst place I have ever been to. I cannot believe what you people are smoking. It's basically a bowl of MSG soup with noodle (or you call ramen?) that's really hard to swallow. A piece of meat on top. That's it. Instant noodle beats it by a mile. If you think it's good, you are crazy. Seriously, take a step back and actually think about what you are putting in your mouth. Or better. Taste it."}
{"text":"Good spot for some of the best ramen in Toronto. BTW, waitresses in this location are cute."}
{"text":"Decent ramen. The service was quick and friendly. Another plus is the relatively spacious seating. Got the tonkontsu black ramen. The thin noodles paired well with the distinct flavour of the black garlic oil. The meat was a bit too thick in my opinion, so the flavour did not sink in. Overall, a solid ramen shop."}
{"text":"So, we were walking by this place, we had talked about trying it out but in no way was I going to ever make a line and wait longer than 10 min. to get into restaurant. We have to already wait for our food once we are inside the restaurant, why make that even longer?   No. No, thank you.  Not in downtown Toronto, where you can't swing a dead cat and not hit a fairly good restaurant nearby. Hopefully, not serving said cat.   However, there was just a couple waiting and thought, \"What the heck?\" We obviously hit a space-time sweet spot since not even 45 seconds after we queued, one group of four and another couple lined up behind us. Then, about 3 minutes later, another couple. We waited about 8 minutes in all to go in, as the line outside was by then something like 10 heads strong.  I have tried ramen a number of times, however I am far from an expert... yet. Although I am pretty good with soups.  Having said that, Sansotei, like most other ramen places in Toronto is ridiculously tiny and in true Japanese fast food Ramen fashion, you are meant to come in, get served fast, eat your noodles and then GTFO. So don't expect to come here and enjoy the decor as Sansotei is spartan, like a buffet restaurant after an Oprah visit.    I had the spicy tantan, since I am a sucker for spicy, however, it was not as hot as I hoped since the Japanese flavour profile is not known for being particularly hot, like say, the Indian profile. Either way, the broth had a deep, lingering flavour which I quite enjoyed. Having made tons of soups at home, I can tell you that you can only get that umami if you extract it from the bones for hours on end -- on my soups at home, the minimum is 6 hours. Sansotei is clearly not messing around.  I do not mind salty, since I have an unadulterated soy sauce addiction problem -- I apologize in advance to the members of my family who have had to live with my shame -- so, I had no issues with the levels of sodium. The noodles were stringy and satisfying.   It is worth mentioning that I felt the serving to be small... for me. I could have easily eaten two bowls and as such, I find that most ramen places in Toronto are somewhat expensive when you take into consideration that:  A-) Ramen is technically fast food. B-) Mostly liquid. (Although I respect the work that goes into the broth) C-) Quite easily not the healthiest of meals.  D-) People will wait 30 minutes. Outside. For a visit that will likely last 10-20.   Culturally speaking, that would be like us Canadians waiting as long to get into a Quiznos. Not to mention that in Japan a pretty good bowl of ramen can be had for 500 yen. (currently $5.5 CAD)   Now, I can't say they serve the best ramen in Toronto, I do not know that. However, I can say that until I taste better, I will be coming back here again. With a smile -- If I do not have to wait in line.  Oh, and as a freebie, I have always thought that the more you know about your food the more you will enjoy it, hence here is a link to an awesome and tasty documentary on ramen.  Enjoy!  http://alas.bz/-MEuT"}
{"text":"I had a tonkatsu ramen, while my brother had the spicy tantan ramen. There were no line up as we went there at 1130, we weren't their first customers!! I found mine was rich in favor but very salty. My eggs were done soft boiled which was perfectly done! I found it not as good as the first time I had it! I didn't try my brother's cause I don't eat spicy, but he said it wasn't spicy enough. The overall decor was basic and food came out fast :)"}
{"text":"There's almost always a wait outside, even at lunch time, but the wait is very short. When we got there there were 4 people in front of us but we only waited for 5-10 minutes before we got seated. Both my husband and I got the Tonkotsu Black Ramen because i saw reviews saying its their best dish. Tbh it wasn't anything special. Its a nice light ramen (not as heavy as kinton), the broth makes you want to finish the entire thing while at kinton after eating the noodles and pork you don't want to finish the soup. The pork isn't as good as kinton though, which was disappointing. The portion is just right for lunch, but if we were to have dinner there we wouldn't be full from just one bowl of ramen. You would have to get some side dishes. Overall, i would come back for lunch if i was in the area and didn't know what to eat."}
{"text":"I love ramen, so when I found out that one of the better chains finally opened a store uptown, I knew I had to give it a try. And what better than a nice hot bowl of ramen on a rainy cold day, which unfortunately is the weather we've been getting a lot lately.  I came here on a Wednesday around 1230 with a party of 3. We waited around 20 mins before we got a table. The waiting area is pretty small, and when we got here, the line was almost out the doors. So I definitely wouldn't want to come here during busy times in the winter, as most likely, you'll have to wait outside. Pretty much all the tables in the restaurant are big tables that seat 6-8 people, so if you come with a party of 4 or less, you'll most likely be sharing the table with another party.   By the time we were seated and ordered, it was around 1pm. I wanted to order the Spicy Tantan, however was told that it was already sold out. The menu does state that there's limited quantity for the Spicy Tantan broth, but I thought it ran out pretty quick, considering their lunch hours are from 12 - 3. Instead, I ordered the Tonkotsu Black with thin noodles. Service was pretty quick, the noodles came out within 15 mins. I loved the broth, it was very thick and creamy. The noodles were also a good texture, just the right level of chewiness. The best part of the ramen was the eggs, which were made perfectly. The bowl came with two pieces of pork belly, which were just average.   Overall, the ramen was pretty good, but I've definitely had better. However, given the limited options for good ramen uptown, I would come back again."}
{"text":"Ramen was quite good and they have a decent variety on them. Service was very authentic (welcomed in Japanese) and meals were served quickly. Portions on the meal were generous as well. It's usually packed so try to come in outside of the busy hours, otherwise you can expect a 10-30 min wait."}
{"text":"It was super busy on a Friday night but still felt like there was no rush in service. Food was pretty good. Don't feel as if they had too much msg either. Definitely good portion for the price. Washrooms could use a little work,  but hopefully not a reflection of their kitchen. Overall nice place to catch a quick meal but wouldn't stay to chat because of the limited space and comfort."}
{"text":"My partner is a ramen/noodle kind of person so this is one of our go to places in the city. Quality is always great here, the portions could be bigger for the price but very tasty nonetheless."}
{"text":"This one located in Markham has a lot more room than the one downtown. Interior design is pretty nice and comfortable.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, which was pretty good. You have the option of picking a thick or thin noodles, soup base wasn't over salty, drank the whole thing. I had worked out before coming here so it didn't fill me up as much as I'd like, so you might want to order extra toppings or a side dish if you're hungry.   I wouldn't mind coming back here, but probably won't make the trip since it's a bit out of the way with all the construction going around the area.   I would give it a 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Good solid ramen. The tonkotsu broth was rich, creamy and flavorful.. absolutely delicious. Thin noodles have a nice bite to it. Pork and egg seasoned very well! Reasonable price, I would definitely come back and try the other items on the menu!   Free parking in 500 Doris ave, the intercom to get buzzed in wasn't working that day. We managed to found a spot out front so we just paid for the green p street parking.. $2.25 for 1 hour."}
{"text":"I've only been to the Markham location once, so this was my opportunity to check out the place where Sansotei started.  Got there at a little after 5pm on a Tuesday and a line had already formed.  I only had to wait about 10 minutes but it was well worth it!  I tried the tonkotsu black for the first time and it was delicious!  Best ramen base I've ever had!  It was garlicky and creamy; perfect!  If you like garlic, I highly recommend it. The ramen also comes with an egg, pork, bamboo shoots and your choice of thick or thin noodles.  What I love about the eggs (I got an extra one added!) is that the yolks are just a tad on the soft side.  Not soft enough to be runny but enough to melt in your mouth!  The restaurant is tiny, so I think a lineup is the norm.  I recommend against going in a group larger than 2 or 3 people.  A group of 4 behind me had to wait about 5-10 min longer just because of their party size.  The service was very quick and polite.  I'd say that they're perfect at turning tables at an effective rate without being pushy.  Finally, the value is amazing!  A bowl of ramen without any extra additions is under $10.  The portion size is pretty good too.  Best ramen I've ever had!  Well worth the wait and the small size of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!  I'm a huge fan of the Sansotei downtown but this is only my second time at the Markham location.  It really seems that they've settled in nicely and remains very consistent with their downtown counterpart.  The staff was very friendly and quick and my favorite ramen (tonkotsu black) was delicious!  I also still can't get over their eggs.  Cooked perfectly and compliments the ramen so well.  Every time I go to Sansotei I'm blown away by how consistently perfect they are.  Disclaimers: 1- There still seems to be a bit of a wait.  I went on a Friday around 7:30pm and had to wait about 20 min.  (Definitely worth the wait though!) 2- It may feel like the staff is rushing you.  Don't blame them, they have to turn over tables quickly to get through the line in my first point!  Overall, amazing!  This location is every bit as good as the downtown one and I can never get enough ramen!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in here for lunch.  Super friendly staff, the food was tasty but the broth was really salty. I'm glad I got some tea (extra) because I kept having to alternate tastes.   Otherwise, I'm super happy with how quickly the food came out and the service in general."}
{"text":"This Markham location is equally as good as the one downtown. I just love how they make their eggs with the whites solid but the yolks still slightly runny. It's honestly THE ingredient that makes me come back for more. At comparable prices, I've had better ramen and better pork belly but I've never been to a place that offered a better egg (or egg at all).   The broth is flavorful and hot, the ramen itself ain't bad, and the service was absolutely wonderful. I had a female waitress who was nothing but smiles and positive vibes (even though I came in at 10:30pm during last call)!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best ramen I've had in Toronto. Their broth has just the right amount of flavour and isn't too salty. Their noodles also have the right amount of chewiness. The pork slices are soo delicious and tender and the eggs have been perfect every time I dined there. The staff are also very friendly and attentive. Your water will always get refilled! The only downside to Sansotei is that they have limited space, so the wait during lunch hours can be long. It's normal to see a line of people on the sidewalk outside of their restaurant, even in the cold!"}
{"text":"This was there best tonkotsu ramen I've ever had. There chatsu was amazing. The mirin egg was to die for. The service was lightening quick. This was the first place my wife and I came to when we visited Toronto.   We are definitely coming back a couple of times even though we are only in town for a couple of days.   This is the kind of ramen I want to learn how to make at home."}
{"text":"This place. It's so so good. Just go. Go eat there. Get the spicy ramen, or the tomato broth ramen, or (my favourite) the black garlic ramen. Do yourself a favour and order the delicious fried chicken. Eat all of it. Have a beer. Enjoy the great service. Pay a totally reasonable price for your meal. Go home and sit quietly until it's time to eat again. Go back to Sansotei and eat again."}
{"text":"Originally tried Sansotei in their toronto downtown location. So glad they brought it uptown to Markham. Great consistent quality ramen - hot & powerful broth. For something different - definitely check out the tomatoe based ramen which is just as delicious if not more so. Good place to have a quick good bite!"}
{"text":"Before coming here, I was prewarned that there would be a long line up.  We waited in line for approximately 10 minutes outside the door and another 10 minutes inside the door.  Finally, after the long wait, we were seated.  We ordered the Zangi (Deep Fried Chicken), Spicy Tantan, Tonkotsu Black and Shio with extra noodles.  I also asked for a pint of Sapparo and they said they didn't have their liquor license yet so they can't serve any alcohol.  Meanwhile, they have a huge advertisement for Sapparo inside the restaurant.  The Zangi came first and I thought it tasted like regular deep fried chicken, nothing spectacular and a little bit on the greaser side, in my opinion.  We did also have to ask for side plates, which I wasn't really impressed with, considering it's common sense to give them to us.  Our ramen noodles were served to us and I began with the broth first.  It tasted good, compared to other ramen places I have been to.  I didn't think it was too salty and the broth wasn't too heavy either.  The only downside I would say was that it was a pretty small portion with only one piece of pork belly.  I also asked to have the Green Tea Cheesecake for dessert and they happen to be sold out of it on a Tuesday night.. That was the one thing I was looking forward to the most!! This place only gets a 3-star from me because of the long line up, the lack of alcohol and cheesecake, and small portions of ramen.  Might I add, after eating my whole bowl of ramen and the deep fried chicken I was still hungry.. Not a good thing to keep me coming back. But let me know when you get your liquor license and the green tea cheesecake back in stock and I may reconsider."}
{"text":"Went to this place during the week of their soft opening and was impressed. Got the Tonkotsu Ramen. Toppings were a good variety but more importantly the eggs were perfectly soft boiled and the pork was tender and tasty. Noodles were also cooked al dente and had a great texture, not sure if its homemade though.The only things I didn't like which were personal preferences only is that the soup was a tiny bit too salty for me (but super flavorful) and I'd prefer to have a bit of a bigger portion. Oh, decor and service was nice as well!"}
{"text":"We came in for a late dinner (read: 9:00 PM) and the place was still extremely full. Luckily, we didn't have too big a group and were seated after a few minutes. I've only had restaurant ramen maybe three or four times in Canada because I've always felt that if I wanted ramen I could easily just make it at home.  I ordered the Tonkotsu black with thick ramen noodles per a friend's recommendation and felt it was decently satisfying. The broth was rich (though a bit salty for my taste), the noodles were nice and chewy, and the ramen already came with a soft-boiled egg and the choice between bamboo shoots, black fungus or corn so I felt pretty full after only half a bowl. I also had a bite of my friend's karaage which was cooked to perfection, so if you're looking for an appetizer that's the one.  The price was a bit steep for the portion I got (judging from other places I've been Sansotei's portion was a lot smaller for the same price) but otherwise I don't really have any complaints. If I'm in the area, I'd go again."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday around 5pm and surprisingly there was no line, even though every time I walk past this place there's tons of people waiting outside! Got lucky, I suppose.  I ordered the Tonkotsu Black, and although it was yummy, I personally found it quite salty. The black garlic sauce intrigued me and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't taste as weird/bad as I thought it would've been! The pork was very tender and soft, and the eggs were pretty much standard.   My friend ordered the tan tan and I took a small sip of the broth and holy hell---that stuff is spicy! Not that I would be able to properly gauge the spiciness as someone who can't tolerate spicy food, but it's definitely a strong punch. Usually \"spicy\" ramens are just a subtle spice and I can push through, but man, I can't imagine finishing even a quarter of the tan tan based on the broth I tried!   Overall it's a good place but not the best that ramen can be. I'd say a short wait outdoors can be justified, but a long wait wouldn't really be worth it."}
{"text":"I would say this is the best Ramen place in the uptown area without travelling to Toronto downtown! When I was there around 7pm, no line up but when I am finished, there is a line up. So it's hard for me to tell when would be the best time to go to avoid line ups.  I tried the Tonkotsu ramen and the quality is very similar to the ramen offered from the same shop in downtown. The broth is rich with pork bone flavor, which is my favorite part in eating ramen. For ramen, I love it when it is really hot (temperature hot)! For the ramen I got this time, it is hot, but it can be hotter and I would love it even more if it is. But it's still  acceptable.  I didn't try other items, I just ordered the ramen and finished and go within 30 minutes. Love it when there is no line up!  I hope they will open for lunch hours as for me personally, I like to have ramen for lunch more than for dinner.   I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This part of town is becoming one of the most culinarily interesting places to explore. This is the third amazing ramen place in the area. And its AWESOME!  It has a small focused menu, that I hope they expand on. But it has all you need, and even a very interesting crepe/sakura/cake thing. Also thought the portions were great.   Simply one of the best ramen places in the city."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Been here a few times, and its one of my choices for a quick ramen fix. Went around 7:00 on a Saturday, and got lucky as a table opened up right as we came in. Normally there is usually a wait around prime dinner hours or you may have to share tables. Ordered the Tonkotsu Black with thick noodles. The garlic oil gives the broth some extra flavor, although in general its already a bit heavy and filling. The portion is decent (could be bigger), with egg, pork belly, fungus and onion.   Service is quick and attentive. Good to see ramen joints slowly moving uptown!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here : ) I think it tastes better than the first time. We ordered the miso black with added pork and my wife ordered the tomato.  For my dish, the soup is really flavourful. The meat is tender. The mushroom is tasty. Egg is runny and yummy. Her dish is really nice too with scallop and pork."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I know why people say this place is home to the best ramen in Toronto...because it is. My goodness. My taste buds are rejoicing.   Exaggeration aside, my experience at Sansotei was amazing. The staff was friendly, the food came fast, and the broth of the ramen was spectacular - flavorful without being too salty and the right consistency of a light creamy soup (more milky if that makes sense), without being watered down. The price is your typical ramen price ($10-15), but this blows all other ramen places out of the water. I must say, it is the best. I'd definitely come again :)  Quick tip: come during \"off hours\" like 4-5pm. Regular mealtimes like lunch and dinners are crazy and lines flow out of the restaurant during prime hours. I didn't have to wait when I went because my friend and I went around 4:30pm for an early dinner."}
{"text":"Came here around 9PM so there was some empty spots and was seated immediately.  We ordered the Spicy tan tan noodles, tonkotsu black, and tomato ramen- all with thick noodles  Spicy tantan tastes like their soup base incorporated with Sriracha sauce. It's a good broth and gives you a great kick of spicy savoury flavour.  The tonkotsu black had great flavour though it might be the MSG. The immense amount of sodium in the ramen made me dehydrated and I kept feeling thirsty afterwards.  The tomato was alright, well-balanced of sweet and savoury.  The egg on top was cooked nicely, and the thick noodles were cooked perfectly (nice texture and was bouncy!)  The food came quick and the portion was not filling as we left still hungry Overall, it's a great ramen place in Markham but wouldn't come often due to the amount of MSG they use in their ramen"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and tried most of their dishes, but I'd have to say my favorite is not the ramen, but the gyudon. It's just a side, but I love the taste and the portion is perfect for someone that wants to lose weight like me :P. I find their ramen a little saltier than I'd like, but I hear that's how it is in Japan. It's a pretty compact restaurant, so you might find yourself sharing a table with strangers. Otherwise, staff are friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"Expect to wait in line outside, but it is worth it! Service is fast, so the turnaround time for a table should be no longer than 10-15 minutes. Only down fall is there is no space inside to wait so on a winter day it gets cold waiting outside!  Raman is good in size. their black garlic raman is delicious and definitely a must get. Also worth it to share a chicken karage or order some for yourself! Very delicious but super salty (as expected for any ramen restaurant!)  Also got their matcha cheesecake at the end. Very delicious and fair in price (i think 4 or 5$ for the slice).  One of the better ramen in town!"}
{"text":"This place is small and busy. We came here on a rainy evening and they didn't have a waiting area. So we had to wait outside the door with the rest of the people waiting to get seated. The wait was about 15 minutes.  We ordered Gyozas and those things were delicious. Everything was GOOD! My hubby wanted their spicy TanTan, but they were all out which was disappointing. I got the black fungus soup. If you're worried about the fungus part, it's literally just dried mushrooms. They give you an option of thick or skinny noodles. The thick noodles are not that much thicker than the skinny. I would have went with thick. Johnny got the Miso. The pork was so good! Hands down to the best bowl of ramen I've had!"}
{"text":"Came to toronto from ottawa for 1 day. Found this resto by walking in front it was pack inside as every other restaurant were empty at 8pm.  Went for a few drink with some friend down the street and we decide to try ramen before heading home. Service was awesome at 10h45. 15mins for closing food was amazing.. I am considering going back for a breakfast bowl of soup this morning before heading back to ottawa"}
{"text":"As we were heading into this ramen place, a guy was coming out and said it was \"the best ramen in Toronto.\" It was not.  The broth was not rich enough for me, and the noodles lacked a certain chewy-ness that is usually in Japanese ramen.   Overall, I felt like it was a pretty good mediocre Japanese ramen place, it certainly wasn't the worst place I've been. If you find traditional ramen too rich for you, this may be the place for you. But if you are a ramen fanatic like me, it's certainly not \"the best ramen in Toronto\""}
{"text":"Been wanting to try their ramen for a really long time now. The downtown location was never open every time I stopped by. Finally got to try the one near my area, I ordered the black ramen. But when it got to me they had forgotten the black garlic oil that goes on top. So they took it to back to the kitchen to add it. Nothing spectacular, the soup base was not even hot enough. The wait for 1 hour was not worth it. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"**RAMEN IS AMAZING**  My second time, and waited even longer in the cold. 15 minutes. But worth the wait.  1st time: Tomato Ramen with thick noodles. Loved every drop.   2nd time: Tonkotsu with thick noodle. I'm drooling just thinking of it.  I want to give 5 stars but they need a bigger space! The food is worth the wait but I did feel a bit rushed because I felt bad for the people waiting outside.   DEFINITELY GO!"}
{"text":"We went there few days after the restaurant opened and the experience was pretty good! Please check our youtube video for the food, menu and experience! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvDLyR8eWsU"}
{"text":"This place is great. There's almost always a line up even on weekdays. Seating is limited. While I like the broth at Kinton better, I like the noodles here better. But not a big difference.   My girlfriend who is Japanese tells me Santouka east of Eaton Centre is more highly regarded by Japanese people. (Most Ramen customers are Chinese). But I personally think Kinton and Sansotei are better. I don't find a massive difference in broth taste. They are all pretty good (with Kinton my favourite) and I would be happy to visit any of them when I have a craving for ramen."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Tonkotsu Black!  The broth was delicious, the pork belly was substantial (and fatty), the egg was so smooth and soft, the black fungus was crisp and fresh, and the thick ramen really had that 'authentic' Japanese feel to it.  I never used to like thick noodles, but ever since having it made so well, I really enjoy it as much as the thin ones."}
{"text":"For what it's worth, I thought this place was pretty good. We came here on a random 3-4pm ish time frame on a week day and it wasn't too busy at all. The wait was almost nonexistent and we were seated quickly.  The staff is friendly, and the menu is pretty easy to understand. Not too many things you need to select from and I would agree that this is one of the better ramen places I've had outside of Japan / Bay Area.   I ended up getting the Tonkatsu ramen because that's generally how I gauge how good ramen is. I'm a big fan of their eggs and the meat was very tender as well. I thought the soup could have used just a bit more of that OOMPH kick in terms of flavor and richness but overall no complaints. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday and got there at 5:25pm.  The restaurant was full and there was about 5 tables ahead of us but we only had to wait about 10 minutes.  Contrary to numerous reviews stating that you had to flag the servers down but we didn't have to.  We were seated and our waitress came promptly about 2 minutes after being seated.  I ordered the Tonkatsu black garlic oil and hubby got the Tonkatsu.  Pros: -Staff was very friendly and very nice, especially our waitress -Food came under 8 minutes -Nice atmosphere -Broth was tasty -Hot spring egg tasted great -Noodles cooked perfectly   Cons: -The ramen broth was at best only warm, this MUST be improved because how can noodle soup be just warm?  Both mine and my husband's bowls were only luke warm temperature  Overall:  I would definitely visit again and hope it was a one off that the food temperature was off."}
{"text":"Its ok. the soups is a bit salty and it doesnt offer you many options on the menu. Its a good place to just grab lunch or dinner. I prefer Santouka."}
{"text":"Delicious. I was going to order a second bowl (even though the portions were generous) but my spouse was kind enough to share hers. I'd eat there daily if I lived in the city."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Toronto, I eat here at least twice. Luckily for me, I'm normally traveling for work solo, so I don't have to wait as long for a table as people in a group. Sometimes the line can be quite intense but I assure you it is worth the wait!  The restaurant itself is a typical ramen shop layout, long and thin with communal tables and a few separated out. The food comes out quick and is absolutely delicious.   If you go, you must order the black tonkotsu! The staff claim its best with thin noodles but I'm a big fan of the thicker style."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I'm never disappointed. I've tried almost all of the popular ramen shops in the downtown core and I keep finding myself back here to enjoy the tan tan ramen. The broth is really sensational; it's always seeping with flavor, the meat is never dry and the noodles are always perfectly al dente. Sometimes they have a layered matcha cake here that is DELICIOUS and a perfect way to end your meal. The prices are more than reasonable. When it's lunch or dinner time be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes for a table but it's definitely worth the wait, especially on a colder fall or winter day."}
{"text":"A great place to have ramen. They have super friendly waiters. And the prices are really good."}
{"text":"I was around the area and looking for something delicious to eat so I decided to Yelp it. Sansotei Ramen caught my attention with over 500 reviews and 4 stars rating. They open at 11am but when I walked over around 11:45am there was already a line of about 10 people lining up and standing outside waiting to go in. The crazy part was that the temperature outside was just slightly below freezing level (30 degrees Fahrenheit or rather -1 degrees Celsius) and yet here we all are... After about 15-20 minutes, my sister and I were finally seated. We ordered the tonkotsu black and and the spicy tantan.  - Tonkotsu Black: Creamy pork broth with roasted black garlic oil. It had a decent depth to it however I felt it could've been a touch stronger and richer. I wasn't particularly impressed, but it really wasn't too bad either. The chasu was not succulent and did not melt in my mouth.  - Spicy Tantan: This ramen had a nice heat to it. But unfortunately it lacked any other flavor aside from just being spicy. My sister did prefer this ramen over the tonkotsu black as she felt the other one is too heavy and fatty, but I wouldn't trust her judgment since she's never really eat ramen aside from packaged ramen. Haha.  Overall, I did not think this place is all that and am not sure why people would line up in the cold for this. I mean unless this is the best Toronto can offer which is sad in itself. The prices are super reasonable which is the only reason why I did not drop my rating to two stars."}
{"text":"This place checks off all the boxes in my book. The staff are incredibly nice, the food is delicious, and they are very quick. Quick with the food, and turning tables.   I ordered the Tonkatsu black, and my friend got the Shoyu - both with thick noodles. The broth was nice a flavourful, not too salty. The garlic oil in the tontaksu blank was potent - just the way I like it. The portions were also very manageable, and not over the top.   Although they are quick, there may be a bit of a wait time. We waited about 10 minutes before getting a table on a Saturday night. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Sansotei Ramen for awhile now but the news of a line up have made me avoid coming here, especially during lunch time!  We visited Sansotei about 4PM because I wanted to avoid the dinner rush as well, luckily, there was no line up and some spots available when we came! The restaurant itself is very small and quite narrow, which makes me understand why there's constantly a line up.  The menu is super simple - only one page which keeps things super slick and leads to fast ordering.  L got the Tonkotsu Ramen which came with black fungus, egg, green onions and 2 pieces of pork belly aka char siew with thin noodles.  I got the Tonkotsu Black Ramen which also came with black fungus, green onion, an egg and 2 pieces of pork belly, along with thin noodles. The only difference between the two is the garlic oil, which gives the soup a different flavour.  All ramens have the option of thin or thick noodles. I love thin noodles when it comes to ramen, as you might have noticed if you've read my ramen posts from Kinton, Ichiran and Hakata Ramen!  The soup base of the Tonkotsu Ramen is very creamy whereas the Tonkotsu Black Ramen wasn't as creamy along with a slightly different flavour because of the garlic oil. The garlic oil made the soup base slightly bitter but still really pleasant to eat.  As I've seen, when it comes to ramen places, there's always an option to add more ingredients at an extra cost.  After visiting Sansotei, it just seemed mediocre to me. Nothing really 'wow'ed me or stood out much. I did enjoy my meal and the service was really fast. The server attending us had a Japanese accent and was really sweet, which is nice to see that the restaurant is keeping the Japanese authenticity even with their servers. Sansotei Ramen also partnered with Millie Crepe for their desserts! When I went, they had the Sakura Crepe Cake for dessert.  I would still drop by from time to time if I was around the downtown area and craving ramen. Not sure if I would be willing to wait in line though... Guess it depends on how long the line is !"}
{"text":"I don't usually go to ramen places bc portions are typically much smaller than my appetite. I came here based on my friends recommendation. I can tell you I was not disappointed with the food, service or the cleanliness of the place. I had a great time there, the very moment I stepped in.  Upon entry, my group was greeted immediately. It's always a great way to start the night. We were seated and the waitress asked what we wanted to drink (green tea or water). I didn't know there was a price for the green tea ($2), so I ordered that. It doesn't matter to me, but some people may want to know that info ahead of ordering their drinks. We ordered our food and as we were waiting, we got a chance to meet the owner. He was a great guy, very informative when we asked about the ingredients and such. Look him up, name is Dominic.  Our food arrived pretty quick. I ordered the spicy ramen (quantity limited based on ingredient). It was actually pretty good - wasn't very spicy and still contained the regular flavours of ramen. The noodle itself was chewy, not under or overcooked. It was, in my opinion, the perfect tenderness.  The restaurant looked clean, and the furnishing complemented the colours of the wall and floor. I didn't get a chance to visit the washroom, so I'll update this for my next visit!  Sansotei Ramen is a great place to be at if you want a mixture of good food and great service! If you're a clean freak, this is the place to be to eat :)"}
{"text":"Beef bowl was unreal. That should be a meal if they made it bigger. Ramen was great.. Pork belly was flavourful but not too fat. Wings were good, not too spicy."}
{"text":"There is always a line at Sansotei - so expect to stand in line to get in. Sansotei is an affordable ramen place. The service is speedy and efficient. This is not the place for you to linger. You eat your ramen and you leave.   The ramen here is delicious. The pork-bone broth is sensational. From the tender texture of the noodles, to the perfectly soft-boiled egg, to the soft, sweet pork belly, and down to the last drop of smooth, bold broth--this was a ramen to be reckoned with. It is on par with Santouka."}
{"text":"Came for early dinner at 5:30pm and there was a line up already! The hype is still strong!   Generally speaking, I enjoyed my visit. We had ordered the tonkatsu black with thin noodles, the spicy tantan with thick noodles, and gyoza. Noodles were cooked perfectly; I personally preferred the thick noodles more. Although it was delicious, I feel that their spicy broth can be improved. I had better - I prefer Santouka's spicy broth more. As for the gyoza, it was nothing special. Also, I think they can work on the presentation more - seems a bit messy or just inconsistent.    Lastly, the servers were polite and pretty efficient.   Two thumbs up! I'll be back! Especially glad that its uptown and close to home!"}
{"text":"I was always a frequent customer at the Sansotei on Dundas. This is the 3rd time I came to this location as it is more convenient for me. I've always ordered the spicy tan tan with no bamboo shoot and thick noodles. The pork was torched enough and a bit too fat to my liking. There's something about the actual noodle itself that I prefer the downtown location. I think it's the texture of the noodle. Overall comparable and worth a try if you haven't stopped by at this location."}
{"text":"I wanted ramen for lunch and prior to this place I had only Kenzo near my work. While good, I had to be in the mood for a really salty soup before taking the plunge.  Then came Sensotai. The soup here is phenomenal. It is flavorful without being salty or overpowering. The pork belly is delicious and a little bit fatty.  I dig the decor and the seating arrangement : a lot of long tables where you share with strangers."}
{"text":"I had the Black Miso ramen. It was a bowl of beauty with a purple flower and two egg halves (perfectly soft boiled). The broth was rich and the juicy black mushrooms complemented the broth. I got two thick pieces of pork that were 2/3 lean meat and 1/3 fat. I chose the thick noodles which were nice and springy.  Solid ramen experience."}
{"text":"Been to many ramen spots in the city and this is still the best for me. Their tonkatsu ramen is simply amazing. The broth is so creamy. I'm sure the calories are crazy but it is worth it.   Service is typical of other ramen places - friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Definitely a must try. This local ramen shop much like those around the area have a very intimate almost crowded feel. There is almost always a line outside their doors, so when we saw an opportunity to slip though the bustle we grasped, and I for one, am glad to have done so. The menu is short, precised, and uncomplicated. The different offerings were differentiated by either the broth, fillings and/or thickness of noodles-or a combination thereof. The price itself isn't overly expensive, although adding more fillings can add up if you're not conscious. Compared with the other ramen shops, this place is definitely top choice. The broth is a reflection of how much care they put into their food; in the different broths I tried, there are depths and flavour to each type, easily distinguishable. We tried the spicy tan tan-though not that spicy but the bowl was visually appealing and the flavours on point. The shredded pepper garnish gave a unique floral note to the bowl and well and entice the eyes. The eggs and pork belly were beautifully prepared in all our bowls. The bamboo gave the bowl the earthy Asian flavour and not at all overpowering (showing how they properly prepared it). The ground pork was a bit lost in the bowl , although nice to know it was there. My issue with this however was once the noodles were gone and the broth cools down through the course of the meal, the soup did became more salty and less appealing. We also tried their tonkotsu black...I absolutely loved it! The fattiness gave the broth that creamy silk mouth feel, nicely complementing the noodle. The dimension of taste they claim is notably present. The different texture gelled well with each component of the bowl. It was a bit salty for my taste but not nearly as much of a problem with it as with the spicy tan tan. This broth is quite fatty but so worth the extra calories. I was worried about the garlic oil adding yet another fatty component to the bowl but it cane out alright...I would've been more happy with the actual fried garlic bits rather than the oil but that's a personal choice. The dessert was average and nothing memorable. The dining experience itself was quite fast pace; seating to ordering to completely the meal and paying happened in a span of 45min...definitely a great for grabbing a quick meal and out the door type place. To be considerate of the people waiting outside, we didn't and wouldn't recommend long dates or group hangouts."}
{"text":"I decided to visit sansotei ramen on a Sunday afternoon to satisfy my craving for quality ramen, and sansotei did not disappoint. I ordered the tonkotsu black ramen with thin noodles. It was absolutely delicious. The broth was rich, pork belly was tender, and the noodle was chewy. Decent portion size. The ramen was actually pretty filling. Service was better than other ramen places, staff was very friendly and helpful in making recommendations.   Note that you will have to share a table with some strangers, but that's just like any other ramen place so that's not a problem for me. My only complaint is that I tried to order a side with my ramen (I wasn't sure if the ramen alone was going to be enough), but was told sides are only served during dinner and not lunch :( But other than that, sansotei was very good and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The best ramen places are truly in the downtown core and this place is one of my fave! This ramen place is known for the soup/broth. I usually come here for the shoyu ramen which has a light soy based flavour and is paired with the right amount of pork and noodles. Even though this place has been opened for at least two years, its worth the wait every time."}
{"text":"This ramen joint is one of my top 2. #1 being kinton.  I haven't been here in a long time, and today I tried the spicy tan tan, which according to their menu it comes in limited quality. Lucky for me I got to try this. The broth in the spicy tan tan had a nice kick to it. I wouldn't say it's really spicy because it's not. One thing I was surprised about was that it only came with one piece of pork belly! Ramen usually comes with two so I was a little sad. Luckily, my bf ordered extra pork belly for himself and gave me an extra one.   The spicy tan tan also consists of bamboo shoots, two eggs and ground pork. Should give it a try the next time you visit sansotei!"}
{"text":"I was just visiting Toronto and my friend said you should go get ramen. And so I did. OMG. IT WAS SO GOOD. We were about 5 minute away when we found Sansotei. It was pouring the whole day so we thought let's go since it's not far. We waited for about 10-15 min and were seated. I love that it is not salty. I wasn't downing glasses of water afterwards. My girlfriends and I all thought it was delish. And because right now CAD is favorable, it only costs around USD 9. In NY, I often pay $12+ for a ramen that isn't as good. We were thrilled. Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"There was a line up when we got there but it was orderly so I didn't have a problem with that. The food was delicious and the service was good. The broth was slightly on the salty side but the egg was cooked to perfection. I would like for the corn to not be an extra charge though."}
{"text":"I was on a ramen kick when I was in town for TIFF.  Sansotei was definitely my favorite.  Better than Santouka, Kinton, and Kenzo IMO.  Big bowls, noodles and pork cooked just right, and broth not too fatty or greasy.  It's straightforward good, and exactly what I exactly what I want when I think of ramen."}
{"text":"It's good but if you don't eat pork there's really not a great variety in options for you."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just visited the new Sansotei restaurant in City Place. We frequent a lot of Ramen spots in the city, but this was hands down, the BEST Ramen we have both ever had. The quality and freshness of both the noodles and broth were on point. The service was extremely friendly and fast. This will be our new Ramen spot!   The only thing to consider is wait time - we arrived at approx 5:00pm on a Sunday and sat right down, but within minutes, the line up formed. The turn around is still quite fast so the patrons weren't waiting too long!   All in all a 5 star dining experience."}
{"text":"Near to home so we come here often.  Best Ramen in Markham. Soup base is a bit too salty though ... but the creaminess of it is great. One thing is they always run out of the chicken appy. Never available when I go here for dinner. You would think they'd make more."}
{"text":"Had the Tonkotsu and it was just blissful. Now, I'm not too picky about the noodles in my bowl of ramen having grown up with the instant variety. I can safely say the rest of the main ingredients-the soup base, the chashu (slice of pork), the soft-boiled egg were perfect. If I were to nitpick I'd say the soup is a bit salty yet I still drank it all and finished the entire bowl!  One thing to note is that, right now, it only comes with two slices of pork while at other places three is the norm. Three would be ideal in this case as well, though they provide an option to add a couple more slices of pork for a small fee.  The only reason I'm docking a star is because they run out of soup pretty quickly. But this also shows it's high in demand!"}
{"text":"Yep. After venturing to many other ramen places all around the city, I realized Sansotei holds a special place in my heart. For me, it is best in class. In fact, I'm gonna award it the top spot on my list. There. I said it. Sansotei is #1 in Toronto. All the elements (broth, noodles, toppings) come together magically and the first slurp always makes me remember why I fell in love with ramen in the first place. Tonkotsu black with extra chashu folks! Simply beautiful!"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic tasting ramen. I had the tonkatsu - the litmus test for ramen in my opinion. The broth had a nice creamy texture and the noodles were the right amount of chewy with flavour retention.   Appetizers were hit and miss. The fried chicken was great. The slow cooked wings were not. The slow cooked wings are good for nostalgia if you are Asian, but very ethnic and overpriced.  The service was very friendly and upbeat. Special mention to Shelly (sic?) who was great at managing the waiting line and overall experience.  Layout was very strange. A less communal seating arrangement would be better."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows ramen well understands that the variance in taste and style is directly impacted by the region it was inspired by, and the culinary direction the chefs are striving for.  For the consumer, it literally boils down to one's palette.  Personally, not fond of the creamy broths that are typical to Hokkaido styled ramen, so I don't enjoy my ramen bowls from here.  BUT, I love their tsukemen!  The concept behind tsukemen is for the broth to lightly coat the noodle, as opposed to the noodle submerging in, and absorbing the flavour of the broth.  If you want to try something new, why not give it a shot?"}
{"text":"Note: the rating is only based on the food I ordered, a 3.5 star. Service is always great.   Tip: Best time to go during lunch time is between 11:35-11:45 a.m.- if you go after noon,  you will be waiting OUTSIDE in the cold.   I always get the Tonkotsu ramen but today I tried the 'spicy tantan' ramen as there's only limited quantity available (sounds exclusive). The server recommended thick noodle so I went with her recommendation. Spicy tantan has pork belly, ground pork, bean sprout, bamboo shoot, egg and green onion. It was quite salty for my taste and there was not enough veggies- I found one bamboo shoot and 2-3 bean sprouts. Noodle was perfectly cooked though. Overall, spicy tantan ramen was A-OK. I prefer Tonkotsu ramen as it never disappoints."}
{"text":"After reading about all these new ramen places in Toronto, we decided come here as it's getting a solid 4 star review from almost everyone. But it was really good. 10 mins wait for lunch on Wednesday.  I read the reviews, and I wonder, can ramen really taste that different from place to place?!? But  it can. This soup bowl of noodles def. has a level up on Kenzo. The brother was clear, but had flavour. It didn't taste overly salty, and I can actually taste each ingredient.   You have a choice between the thick or thin noodle or Sansotei original noodles. Honestly don't really know the difference. I got the regular sized portion with no extras, but seems like an extra pork belly would have been nice, because they gave 2 only.  The preserved egg was poached perfectly half cooked. I don't know how they do it.   This time I actually finished all the broth. I usually don't because it's overly salty. I cannot tell if it's msg flavoured, but seems much less than most places.   The ONLY PROBLEM is finding parking in this god forsaken area. You'll get street parking if you're lucky. It's cheaper than any lot."}
{"text":"This place was great. Had to wait about 10-15 mins in line since it was full inside. The place is pretty small but do not let that fool you with their capabilities.  My gf and I ordered the tonkotsu black. The portion size was good. I'm a big eater and I was definitely full after eating mine... and a quarter of my gfs.   The noodles had a great texture, a little chewy, but a good chewy. The garlic they put into the soup added a great taste. I haven't had the opportunity to try just the tonkotsu which does not have the garlic but I'm sure it would still be just as amazing. The two orders came up to about $23 prior to tip. The service was okay. We stayed for about 20 mins during our eating session and hadn't had out waters filled once. Other than that, the food was great!"}
{"text":"After seeing incredible long lines (in Toronto cold) for lunch, and then saw no lines one faithful Saturday afternoon, I just had to try it.  I ordered the Tonkatsu Black and the first thing I noticed was how \"rich\" (fatty), the broth was.  Now I love pork belly and really appreciate how \"rich\" it was and I did really enjoyed my bowl, but I have a feeling that most other people may not enjoy that \"rich\" of a broth (may explain to me why everyone else around me ordered miso).  Regardless, everything else from the noodles and the egg was great.  Well worth the wait (I think, but then again, I didnt wait at all...)"}
{"text":"\"Itadakimasu!\" - in Japanese, that means \"I humbly receive,\" but in a mealtime setting, it's compared to \"Let's eat,\" \"Bon appétit,\"  For those who never tried Raman soup-noodles before, \"Itadakimas\" might sound like, \"Eat-This-Yuky-Mess\" .. but I assure, it is DELICIOUS! If this is your first time, try the \"TONKOTSU BLACK\" - it's raman noodles, with pork, and  flavourful black garlic oil on top, and have it with the THIN noodles for an authentic experience - heaven!    I also ordered the ZANGI CHICKEN - probably the most flavourful morsel pf fried chicken you'll ever eat - this is no Zinger KFC - it's not spicy, but does have lots of spices you could taste - squeeze some lemon on it - yummy!  I also ordered a bottle of cold Sapporo beer - goes down really well with the Raman and Zangi Chicken.  This place sets a HIGH BENCHMARK - and will be the place that I use to compare all other Raman restaurants worldwide!"}
{"text":"Didn't get the hype around this place.  Got here early to beat the lunch line.  Came here with my folks because they'd been meaning to try it out too.  I'm a pretty big ramen fan, and so I ordered their tonkatsu black garlic oil and my folks each ordered the tantan, one with thick one with thin noodles.  I tried to order side dishes but they don't make them at lunch, essentially meaning all they offer is drinks and ramen.  Kinda disappointed in that since I'm trying to ... well try the foods and I can't.  You also have to pay for tea, something surprising since its the first ramen place I've been to do that.  Bowls came and their the that V style bowl vs the U.  What I mean by that is, the V style bowl looks like its got a lot of noodles when you're looking straight down and it, but not much one you start eating.  Onto the food.  Sorry, it was a bit overrated.  They do get props for their eggs which were perfectly cooked!  Just runny enough on the inside!  The ramen itself was tasty, but nothing really special, especially after all the hype.  Prob go back just because their aren't many other ramen places uptown (yet!)"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner as it was early and no line up.  Soup base was good...I had the spicy one. But for the price you pay you would think they would give at least 2 pieces of meat/pork belly.   My wife had the other soup which was just okay...maybe because I had the spicy one first that this tasted just okay.  On a cold winter day this would a welcoming treat but need more meat."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Ramen and I have to say that I was thoroughly impressed. The service on this Wednesday evening (6pm) at Sansotei Raman was excellent, fast, attentive and comfortable. I especially appreciated them not rushing us after our meal even though there was a line forming outside.  The Spicy Tantan ramen and side order of Zangi (deep friend chicken) were both excellent; tasty and satisfying. I WILL return."}
{"text":"Coming here is a gamble and they don't respect students. I came here for the first time I ate the Tonkostu Black it was very salty that I couldn't even finish the bowl. However after 3 months I decided to go and try the Tonkostu Black again and it was really good not too salty and it was just right. However the waitress was rushing us to leave when no one was even waiting to be seated, she handed me the bill.  While the 2 adults siting next to us  didn't order there bill until they felt like leaving. I felt that it was really rude, just because I'm a student dose not mean I'm going to run and not pay. Sometimes I wish restaurants would treat students with more respect and give us the benefit of the doubt that we will pay and not make a run for it."}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant often as my family loves ramen. What can I say it's always delicious and it never fails to leave my cravings satisfied. My favourite is the tonkotso black while another favourite is the miso black.   The restaurant is always clean with attentive and friendly staff. One of my absolute favourites."}
{"text":"I frequent this place often to satisfy my Ramen craving. With 2 locations in downtown Toronto, Sansotei is super convenient to access as well. This time I ordered to tonkotsu with thin noodles and zangi (fried chicken) to share.  The zangi is different from the typical karagee, the skin is slightly thinner and more crispy rather than crunchy.   Their tonkotsu broth is always super rich, although it does not leave me as heavy as some other Ramen shops. You also get one soft boiled egg with your ramen, which is really a party in your mouth. I love placing one half of the egg in my ladle and filling it with broth, and then one-shotting it (you will thank me).   If you haven't been to this Toronto classic yet, I IMPLORE to do so!"}
{"text":"Got there and they had a short line outside but thankfully we were seated within two minutes so waiting wasn't bad at all. Once inside checked out the menu I wanted to have the spicy tantan but they didn't have in stock ordered the zangi (deep fried chicken) and it was delicious. Now for the for the main we both had the shio ramen thin noodle, nothing else to but DAMN!!!! It was really good! Will definitely go back again. Thanks for a great dinner guys"}
{"text":"Really solid ramen and much quieter than Kinton. My go-to in Richmond Hill for authentic ramen cravings. They don't have a lot of variety on their menu though but that's fine. Clean, relaxing interior and good service."}
{"text":"I've been to the downtown location and it was stupendous! The new Yonge and Finch location was a godsend for the uptowners.   I tried the spicy ramen, it was the perfect amount of heat for me, I'd compare it to medium-hot level of chicken wings level of heat. The broth is worthy of emptying your bowl and the noodles had that nice tender resistance while chewing. I would put the noodles in the same league as Kinton or Kyouka as I had ramen from there within the last few weeks to compare.   Small seating area, service was pretty good, not as good as the downtown location I thought, but still tentative and kind."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I love its tonkotsu ramen and miso ramen.  The broth was flavourful.  Noodles were different from competitors, and tasted a bit like pasta noodles.  Would love to have bigger portion though - guys would not feel full with just a bowl.  Didn't try other dishes so I can't comment more.  Like previous posters, I would like to see the following improved in the future:  1) Healthier choices: They should let customers choose between fatty pork belly vs leaner meats.  2) Complimentary green tea: This is pretty much a given at most Japanese places these days.  Unless their tea is brewed with premium tea leaves, regular green tea should not be charged with a hefty $2 per glass.  3) Waiting list: This is my biggest pet peeve.  They should at least take down customers' names and table sizes instead of having them lining up outside in cold weather, and worrying about other people buzzing in line.  Those waitresses often have no clue of who's in front of who, and I could see many customers were frustrated because of this.  There was even a verbal fight between one customer and the waitress the time I was there.  Totally unacceptable.  This is poor customer service!"}
{"text":"This location is great but maybe for a unfortunate reason to the business. There is the vivanext construction that has been ongoing--meaning there is no wait unlike the other location (note I hate waiting at restaurants).  Food wise is consistent (which means great) because they all have the standards they adhere.  Their service is also consistent which is also perhaps a franchise standard.  One thing I noticed different than other franchises is their decor and seating, it's actually a bit different than the other locations.  It's more spacious and comfortable, and the decor is nicer.  Therefore because of the location and comfortable seating, it got 5 stars."}
{"text":"The go-to ramen place for this little family of Yelpers. So thankful it opened so close to home.  Wifey and hubby are pretty boring when visiting this spot coz both gets exactly the same, which is Tonkotsu Black. It is pretty much tonkotsu ramen but with the delicious addition of garlic oil.   You get the option to pick whether you want thick or thin noodles.  Always end the meal with either their tofu cheesecake or matcha cheesecake, or even both! They're okay nothing spectacular. Matcha is very rich. Go with tofu if you prefer something lighter to end your meal."}
{"text":"I lived very close to the first sansotei in DT Toronto.  At that time my friend kept telling me that i should try it out, That it is one of the best ramen in Toronto.  Only problem is that they do not the reservation and will not let you take out the ramen. There's always a line outside and i lack the patience to wait.   So i was very happy when they finally opened one up in north York.  This location doesn't seem to be as well known so you usually don't have to wait.  I usually go for the very basic tonkatsu with thick noodle. The hearty yet clear broth hits the spot in cold winter night and the chewy noodles provide textured sensory to complete the experience.   It is a small and clean shop with quick services. A bit cramped but this is kind of the norm for ramen places anyways"}
{"text":"Best Ramen place in town!!!  My favorite is the Tonkotsu Ramen which the waitress said it was the least salty one and it was very good! Not too salty like most other Ramen places. The pork was tasty as they pan fried it before putting it in the ramen to bring out it's flavor. The soft boiled egg (my favorite so I'm picky about how well its done) was perfect too! The soup was very good - measured up to the Ramen place I tried in Okinawa, Japan. Lastly, the noodles were also cooked to al dente! Amazing bowl of noodles!   I've also tried the Zangi (fried chicken) before which is pretty good too! The touch of lemon to it is a great addition.   So to reiterate: Best Ramen in Toronto!! You must try it!!! It is definitely worth the line up! Even in the Winter (which I've done)"}
{"text":"Came by here for dinner with my friends. I never knew this area was so developed since the last time I was here. Anyhow... so I was trying to find this restaurant. This signage is tucked below a roof ledge of sort, so it is not that evident unless either you live in the area or pay really close attention. So I had a party of 8 and luckily we got a table. Inside is clean and smells of yummy cooking of ramen.   I ordered the ramen and Sapporo combo, which include the Miso Black with thick noodle and the Sapporo. My bowl of ramen came out not long after. I must say this ain't bad: the chashu was yummy and has just right amount of fattiness. The noodle had just the right amount of texture and chewiness, I always like noodles al-dente even ramen. As for the soup, I asked for low sodium. And I am glad I did cause I can taste the flavour of the miso instead of just salt.   Overall experience not bad. Wish they got better furniture over the plastic and flimsy chairs."}
{"text":"I've been to this ramen place a few times now. Each time, there has been a wait to get a seat. I've waited anywhere from 15 minutes to half an hour for a table for two to three. A few times, we have had to share a table with other people, which is fine.  There aren't a lot of options in terms of menu items. A small ramen and dessert selection. Go early, or you will miss out on getting the spicy tantan ramen. The spicy tantan ramen is delicious. Perfect amount of spiciness, creaminess, and saltiness. I've also gotten the black garlic ramen. I don't know how I feel about it because I've gotten it at the downtown location as well. It tastes almost burnt to me, but not in a bad way. I prefer the thin noodles as opposed to the thick ones, but I do like that they give you a choice in what kind of ramen you get. I personally find the pork belly a little too fatty for my liking. Each time I've gotten it, I find that there's more fat than there is meat.   I've tried the tofu cheesecake and while the flavour is good, I'm not a huge fan of the texture. Bits and pieces of hard tofu throughout a small slice.   This ramen place is ok, but with so many other options sprouting up in the area, this isn't a place that I would rush to for my ramen fix."}
{"text":"My favorite place I visited during my Toronto trip. I ordered the Spicy TanTan and the girlfriend ordered the Tonkatsu Black. You have the choice of ordering thick or thin noodles. We both ordered the thick noodles.  The ramen noodles were PERFECT! Cooked to perfection, the noodles weren't too soft, nor were they too hard...perfectly perfect. They had 2 slices of pork belly in my bowl, which was great as some ramen places only give one!   Spicy Tantan - The broth was great. Slightly spicy and rich. Paired well with the thick noodles, the pork belly and the egg. The egg, however, was slightly cold-ish, which I wasn't a big fan of. As much as I liked the spicy tantan, if I ever make my way back, I'd definitely go for the...  Tonkatsu black - Broth was amazing! Again, paired well with thick noodles, which I would recommend. Again pork belly was cooked to perfection. I only tried it, but the broth was much much better than the spicy tan tan.   Service - excellent. Checked in on us often. Also, at about 6pm on a Wednesday, there was only a slight wait. We were the second party in line and waited about 10 minutes.   Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent ramen, reminded me of the great Japanese food in Sydney. Very busy usually. Authentic Japanese. Prices around $10."}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying although this wasn't my favourite ramen I've ever had, I still think it rates as one of the top because for the first time ever - I finished my bowl.   I think it was well portioned ramen (not to heavy, but a good amount to fill you) I ordered the tonkotsu ramen. I'm usually a spicy ramen type of person but the spicy tantan ramen they have has bamboo shoots in it. I wasn't entirely sure how I'd feel about that since I'm not the biggest fan. I think that the tonkotsu ramen has good flavour. The tonkotsu black has even more flavour though, so if you're deciding between the two get the black, unless you're a plain Jane.  Service was nice and quick when we went! It was later in the evening though.   Will I be back? For sure"}
{"text":"Sansotei Markham is in the Whole Foods plaza, beside Five Guys. It's bigger and a lot more spacious than the one downtown! Came here at 6pm on a weekday, and we didn't have to wait for a seat :). It was nice that they let me bring outside bbt into the restaurant since I was afraid it would melt in the car on a hot sunny day.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Black ramen with thin noodles, and I loved the garlic oil taste. I found that the slices of pork were thicker than what I got in downtown location, so that was a plus! The noodles were really chewy and I liked that crispy sensation when biting the black fungus.   The soup base wasn't too salty, so I wasn't dying of thirst after the meal.   An overall positive experience! Will be back. :)"}
{"text":"I love their ramen! The spicy tan had the perfect flavor and the broth was on point.  It was a taste I've never experienced or had before.  This place is a must try place when in Toronto!   Also, if you want to eat here, I advice you arrive early because you would have to wait in line.  It's that good!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  The tonkatsu ramen was hot, the broth was very murky, but a good thin consistency, there were thick pieces of pork, and thin sliced strips of woodear inside. It was a pretty good, decent bowl of ramen, but I just felt something was missing... a wow factor? Something just wasn't there.  The restaurant though small, and rectangular shaped, was comfortable, and looked like a normal ramen joint with nice wood tables and seating."}
{"text":"Long overdue review for this place. Food is pretty good, ordered a Tokhnkatsu ramen and the pork is super soft. Noodle amount was just right, and the soup isn't salty at all. Only down side is the restaurant is small and there's usually a line up for lunch."}
{"text":"Tried their Dundas location before, but it is quite a trip to go downtown from Markham. Line up on a Saturday was 20 mins or so. Food wise is about the same. Service is fast."}
{"text":"There's nothing I can say about this place that hasn't already been said. My go to is the tonkatsu black extra cha Shu with thin noodles. Money every time.   The service is really good. Food comes out super quick. We've been here many times and will continue to eat here definitely recommended."}
{"text":"After reading reviews on yelp, I decided the Tonkatsu would be the best bet.  It was rich but it was -32C with the wind chill, so it hit the spot.  I found the noodles firm and had less egg in in so less yellow than other places.  It was still very tasty to me.  I thought the pork was very flavourful.    There was also some black strips that were crunchy (not too much) but gave very nice texture to the soup.  I forgot to ask what it was.  Worth going to again."}
{"text":"my favourite ramen place in toronto. service is always friendly and fast. noodles are nice and chewy. soup broth is never too salty."}
{"text":"Everybody kept raving on about Sansotei, I found it very average. Service was 5/10. Soup was bland, portions were a bit small.  I probably wouldn't come back, but to each their own?"}
{"text":"Came here around 2pm on Saturday to have a quick lunch. Since they close around 2:30 there wasn't a long line, there was only one party in front of us. The decor of the restaurant is really nice and plenty of tables. I decided to order then miso black and I shared the fried chicken. First, the miso black had too much pepper in the soup, which made it taste too seasoned. The fried chicken was also over cooked and tasted too crispy. Overall the service was great but the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Lineups galore? Only time I ate here was at 10pm an hour or so before they were about to close. The ramen here is good and authentic but too pricey for the amount I got. If they increased the amount of noodles then I would increase a star."}
{"text":"We did a ramen hunting in the long weekend, we stopped by here although there are lots of people.  Loved your black ramen with garlic, it was one of the best."}
{"text":"Mr. winter is coming and with his blowing frozen whispers, so do my quest to search for the best pho and ramen places.   The echinacea hasn't stop my \"achusss\" and running nose, so I decided to grab some liquid meal relief to help as a treatment.   I read some reviews that made me think that visiting Sansotei was going to make me a frequent customer, and ask them for a points card, but my taste buddies disagreed.  I visited the place around 4 pm. Fortunately there was plenty of room, because I would've been pissed if I put myself on a line for something merely regular.  The place is cozy, with a wooden based decoration, and relaxing ambiance. Maybe that is why lots of people visit this joint to eat by themselves.  The menu is simple, few options of ramen, appetizers, extra toppings, a couple of desserts, and beer (6.50 for a Sapporo).  I ordered the spicy tantan (only available till they run out) with thick noodles, and extra black fungus. The service was fast and in less than 5 minutes I was sipping that orange broth.   Let's say that after 3 hrs while writing this review, I haven't been able to remove the taste of garlic from the back of my tongue (I brushed my teeth, made gargles with mouthwash, drank a mint tea, made more gargles with oxygenated peroxide, chewed cardamom and parsley...). I couldn't feel any spiciness because the garlic over passed any other flavor. I know the soups are cheap, and the one I asked had minced pork, but putting only 1 slice of meat full of gristle was miserly... The soup had like 2 or 3 slices of something that could've been bamboo shots, and a lot of salt.  I've tried way better ramen joints so this goes to the \"not going back list\"."}
{"text":"I tried black garlic ramen. The flower in the ramen is pretty but didnt want to try it. I guess its ok but not the best. I found the soup oily and a bit salty."}
{"text":"This was the third time that we came to Sansotei at Markham.  The decor and the ambience are nice.  Unlike some other smaller ramen shops, you can sit comfortably at this location even with a large group.  I ordered a Tonkotsu ramen and my wife had a Shoyu ramen.  The noodles came in good, hot temperature.  The regular Tonkotsu noodle is not as oily as most other ramen shops.  The taste of the Tonkotsu soup is decent but lack of depth.  Chashu comes with a slight grill which is good and tasty, and again it's not as fatty as typical chashu ramen. The portion is good and the servers are friendly.  If you are in the area and are looking for a ramen fix, try this place out."}
{"text":"It's the best ramen in Toronto! Really love the soup~ hope you guys have more side dishes though~"}
{"text":"Do not come here if you are a strict vegetarian.  All the ramen dishes come with pork, and you can substitute it for veggies, but all the broths are pork based.  One of my co-workers found out the hard way and left to find food elsewhere.  We felt bad, of course, but we have come so far from the office for the ramen.  I just hope he doesn't end up with the group of meth guys we saw panhandling on Dundas.  The place is small and we shared a table with some other patrons.  The ramen are around $10 and I ordered the most popular item - Tonkotsu ramen with regular noodles.  The other noodle options are thin and thick.  This is my first time trying the Tonkotsu and it did not disappoint.  The broth was creamy and delicious!  The egg was perfectly cooked and it made me wonder how they did that.  There must be a refined process.  The noodles were good and I enjoyed the entire ramen dish.  The pork was fatty and very tasty.  We came for lunch after 1pm and got seated right away.  The décor was nice and modern.  The service was fast."}
{"text":"Best bowl is ramen I've had a in very long time. We got here at 7PM on a Saturday and thankfully there was only one person in front of us because it was 40 degrees, and we were tired and hungry from a day of exploring. In the 10 minutes or so that we were waiting, 4 or 5 parties joined the line. This place is really tiny so there's bound to be a wait even during off hours. We passed by earlier in the day around 2:30PM and there was a line outside.  It's pretty simple. They sit you wherever there's an open spot, so you're likely to be sharing a table with other patrons. There are a handle of ramen options and you choose between thin/thick noodles, and you can pay for add-ons. I love that they give you a full egg because nowadays too many ramen joints are only giving half.  Tonkotsu black - traditional pork bone broth with roasted garlic oil. They really knocked it out of the park with this one. The aromatic broth was delicious and the thin noodles were cooked perfectly.   Tomato - For noodle lovers looking for something different, you've got to try this one. I swear the thick broth wraps you in a comforting embrace. It comes with a Hokkaido scallop, which was so delicious.  Sides: The gyoza and karaage were decent but we barely paid attention to them because the ramen was so good.  I highly recommend this spot for an affordable and delicious meal that will warm your body and soul."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen I've had in Toronto I had the Tonkotsu ramen- very rich and creamy. Perfect for a cold day The pork belly was good but Momofoku's pork belly was more melt in your mouth if thats what your fancy is.  Also got the deep fried chicken - Disappointed this. Didn't really taste as special as I thought it would. It also only came with 4 tiny pieces for about 5 bucks. It was meh!"}
{"text":"We've been to both the downtown and Markham location and I would say that both locations are equally as good. the one on Markham opens 5pm daily and closes around 10pm. get here before 7pm to get a table quick. They don't take reservations. The restaurant sign is not visible you really have to look for it. The black oil and regular ramen noodle soup is very good along with the fried chicken...they acfually give you real chicken. I find the staff to be ok not rude or super polite.They seem to like to gather in the back of the resto and chat. I always hear them giggling.They don't seem to be too serious of their job.If you're in the neighborhood and craving ramen noodles this is the place to be. The parking lot has lots of space."}
{"text":"Overall, I would rate Sansotei 3.5 stars.  I had dinner here on Sunday at around 5pm. There were plenty of seats as there were only 4 other diners in the restaurant.  I ordered tonkotsu while my bf ordered tonkotsu black, both with thin noodles. The food came out fairly quick and tasted pretty much the same as the downtown location: rich, salty (in a good way), flavourful and comforting.  Normally I find ramen very rich and have a hard time finishing my bowl but I easily finished this one. I do find the portion to be on the smaller side and feel that they are skimped on the pork belly. A couple hours afterwards My bf and I were hungry again so I feel like Sansotei is a better choice for lunch than for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to most of the Sansotei locations and the service and quality is consistent.   My friend and I both ordered Tonkotsu Raman with thin noodles and a side of gyoza. The ramen came out first and was delicious as always. The egg was perfect with the runny yolk and I like how their broth isn't too rich and salty.   The gyoza took a little bit longer to come. It tastes like a typical gyoza, nothing special. It's a good side though.   The servers here are more attentive than other locations, it may be because they recently opened. They made sure our hot teas were refilled and took our finished bowls away soon after we finished eating.   Overall, good food, good company, and good service. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"My friends and I arrived on Thursday at about 1:30pm and there was a lineup outside, about 3 groups in front of us. After 15mins we were seated.   The servers were very attentive and gave us a good amount of time to look over the menu. I decided with Tonkotsu Black with thin noodles while everyone else ordered Shio with thin noodles. Our orders came pretty quick and my God, the \"black\"  in Tonkotsu Black definitely made the ramen 2x more delicious but toward the end of my meal, I grew a little bit tired of thee garlic flavour. What I really liked though, was the ramen came with various toppings such as an egg and black fungus. Other shops tend to charge extra for those, so I thought that was a plus. The only thing I didn't like and docked off a star was the broth was just a touch too salty for me. Other than that, my experience was excellent."}
{"text":"Third time's the charm! Yes, I've tried to get in twice before and both times, I gave up on waiting. It's winter in Canada; I do not have enough commitment to wait outside for an hour. But a friend tipped me off that Wednesday is a good night to go so I finally got to try out this place. I've been to the Sansotei downtown before so I was excited to give this one a try.   First of all, they are hyper efficient. Service is faster than anywhere I've ever been. It helps that they are a pretty small space and only have about 10 items on the menu, half of which are ramen that probably use the same ingredients with just a different soup base. The servers are also really professional and upbeat. Most places that hire young people lack training, but these ladies and gents commanded the floor like bosses. They checked up on us and our water was always filled (my personal indicator of good service).   The ramen is really really good (and affordable!). It has less sodium than Sonoya (which I recently learned is the same as Kenzo). I got the thick noodles in tonkotsu black. Noodles had good texture, soup base was flavourful, pork was juicy, and that egg was perfection. We also had a side of the fried chicken and gyoza. Gyoza was average but the fried chicken had great, fresh flavour with a good amount of crispy and not a lot of grease. We finished with matcha cheesecake (at the suggestion of other Yelpers): creamy NY style cheesecake with a hint of strong green tea. It was a great way to cut the saltiness from the rest of the meal.   I'm going to have to be honest, I was prepared to not give this place a high rating because of the frustration with getting inside. But I can't deny them. Service is excellent, food is delicious, and I am a happy customer.  (12/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"Pretty good ramen, a/c wasn't so high I froze to death but I was definitely comfortable. Seated immediately, food came immediately, wait staff was attentive and friendly. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted warmly by all the wait staff. Got there 30 minutes after they opened up and we were able to snag our own table instead of being seated at one of the communal tables.   Loved the simplicity of the decor, emphasis was made more on natural colors and textures.   Ordered the  following: -Spicy Tan Tan sesame flavour ramen (limited quantity made) topped with a piece a chashu, a soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, ground pork and shredded chilli pepper. Loved the level of spice, the soft egg, and the thin noodles had a nice chew to them; but there was something in the broth that tasted like they dumped a packet of seasoning from a ramen noodle package. - Gyoza - you could tell they were made fresh in house, delicious! A little wait but definitely worth it. - Chicken Karaage (Zangi), Hokkaido style - tasty little morsels of juicy fried chunks of battered chicken. You have a choice between mayo with chilies or chili oil to dip them in. - Sakura Crepe Cake - Sakura flavor was overpowering for such a delicate cake.  There's so many different ramen joints out there, I'm sure one of these days I'll find one that suits my taste."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am never usually in this part of town and my rating is based on my first ramen experience at this place. It was delicious. I had the Tonkatsu black which is their original ramen recipe with the addition of garlic oil. So wholesome and satisfying, there was also fungi strips, egg and pork belly in the broth. I drool thinking about this. I will not hesitate to return. In fact I may even make the trip..."}
{"text":"The ramen here is very filling and hits the right spot. However, I would say that the broth and noodles are a little bit underwhelming, but out of all of the ramen places I've visited in Toronto (so far) - the meat is the most softest and riches slice of pork I've ever had. I'd down to go back and try other flavours!"}
{"text":"Great Ramen. Not too salty. Downside is the wait and parking while plenty, could be hard to get a spot at peak times. Bathrooms are clean although a tad too dark."}
{"text":"I love all ramen for the most part but I love Sansotei the best. Can't quite describe why but the flavour here is just unmatched although the meat is somewhat lacking sometimes, I'm always satisfied by the quality of the food at any location. The lineup here is outdoor so good luck in the winters and dress warmly!"}
{"text":"Toronto has been lacking in quality Ramen places for some time compared with our friends in Vancouver.  We've had some mediocre options from Kenzo and Ajisen, but for the first time, I can honestly say that Toronto has a fantastic Ramen shop.  This is a new ramen restaurant that recently opened in the former location of Pho Cali on Dundas St. West, near University Avenue (St. Patrick Subway Station).    The changes they've made are pretty dramatic.  The restaurant has a very modern decor, well lit and makes use of the narrow width very well.  The menu isn't all that extensive; It has Tonkotsu Ramen, Shoyu Ramen, Shio Ramen, Miso Ramen, Shoyu Tonkotsu Ramen and Chilled Ramen.  However, what it does serve is very tasty. The eggs are perfect - they're well marinated and soft boiled.  (Often I find that the ramen restaurants tend to use hard boiled eggs which isn't the case here).  The Chashu Pork Belly melts in your mouth and is so so so tender.   The noodles themselves are perfectly al dente and feel fresh.  They taste home-cooked but I did not confirm this with the owner.  Moreover, the broth is fantastic.  It has the perfect amount of richness.  I didn't have any appetizers over my two visits so I cannot comment on that part of the menu.  All I can say is that this restaurant is fantastic and that it is my favourite ramen restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"My second favorite Japanese Ramen place in dt Toronto so far!!! Tasted really good but not salty!"}
{"text":"Hot cheap food. No flavour, extremely salty and bland. Textures can be comparable to el dente ramen noodles with a touch of store bought powdered stocks. Pork belly and egg were overcooked. Friendly and polite service. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Out of all the new Ramen shops opening up in Downtown Toronto, This place is my fav so far. There are line-ups every time I go, and this place loses a star because it's way too small. The demand is much higher than they can handle with the limited seating space, as well parking is expensive and not that close. Another note, I came on a Sunday and they are closed. I'm sure many people wants to come on Sundays, please open on Sundays! :)  Food: The ramen is delicious, It has a good texture, chewy, bouncy-ness to it. The pork is nicely caramelized on the edges and they make a perfectly boiled egg with melty egg yolk, I always ask for less salt and no msg with my soup base, my fav is the pork bone flavour. I would come back, but ONLY if I don't see a long up outside, otherwise I will keep driving along..."}
{"text":"First off, I went when the lineups were insane when they first opened so I'll cut them some slack.  I had the tonkotsu ramen along with some karaage.  While the karaage was tasty, and done just right in terms of texture and moisture, what I didn't enjoy (and I guess this is just personal preference) was that they didn't offer leaner cuts of pork - I got very fatty cuts, which were kind of gross...  I'd say this place stacks up below the pack in terms of the other ramen powerhouses like Santouka, Raijin and Kinton.  If you're a ramen adventurer like myself - give it a shot anyway as it'll still hit the spot of getting your ramen fix on :9"}
{"text":"My FAVE soup base for ramen is AT SANSOTEI! yummy. I usually order the original tonkotsu broth. I have tried the black (more intense/stronger flavours of garlic) and tried the spicy tan tan but i only prefer original and the subtle creamy flavour.   So glad that they opened another one in Markham (but I have to say that I think DT one tastes yummier and creamier??? )  I think the soup is delicious compared to other ramen places. I wish the noodles were yummier though. i usually request for FIRM noodles (but whether it is thick or thin noodles... still can't get it quite the chewy texture that I prefer).  The meat is not as fatty and yummy as other meats, like Kinton, but just for their soup --- I'll keep coming back to Sansotei"}
{"text":"New location, haven't been to the others. Decor is very nice, but seating wasn't very comfy (wooden benches).   Service: Waiteresses were very attentive, as there weren't too many customers and it was relatively early. Japanese greeting and farewell (thanks) were a nice touch.   Food: Tonkotsu broth was very rich, although on the salty side (similar to that of ramen in Japan). Texture of the noodles was al dente, ideal for ramen. Soft boiled eggs cooked perfectly with a runny yolk. Garlic flavour was good for the tonkotsu black, recommended over the spicy tan tan.   Overall: Go to ramen spot for Richmond Hill, saves the trip to Markham or downtown."}
{"text":"The weather was STILL crappy outside and we were watching David Chang's The Mind of a Chef, which got us in the mood for ramen.   We had to wait in line outside for about 10 minutes at dinner time; not too bad, based on other reviews I have read with regards to the wait time. Keep in mind that this is a tiny restaurant, so the wait is to be expected. If you really don't want to wait, try not to go during lunch or dinner rushes! Having said that, it is well worth the wait. Sansotei is now my favourite ramen restaurant!   My boyfriend and I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with Original noodles and the Tonkotsu Black Ramen with Thick noodles. (Both have pork belly, black fungus, green onions and an egg.) They were both so delicious, and come in a rich and creamy broth. The noodles were perfectly cooked, not in the least bit mushy, and the broth wasn't too salty. The black fungus provided a nice contrast to the rest of the ingredients in the bowl. While we both loved the Tonkotsu Ramen, the Tonkotsu Black Ramen was our favourite. The garlic oil really gave it the extra something to help round out the flavours and really stood out in our minds. We had initially wanted to try the Spicy Tantan, but they were out (they serve only a limited quantity of this daily).   We also ordered the Zangi (deep fried chicken), which was okay but consisted of lots of fatty pieces. I wouldn't order it again.  We're already planning our next visit to Sansotei!"}
{"text":"Très très bon! Il n'y a pas d'option végé mais il peuvent à tout le moins remplacer le porc par autre chose, les shitakes sont sucrées et délicieux"}
{"text":"Quality of food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5 Overall: 5  (Entered with a group of 4)   As we entered the building we got a warm welcome in Japanese to our surprise. Looking around the decor had a cozy feeing to it. We got seated almost immediately because we entered at a time that wasn't too busy. (It usually gets busy around 5:30 - 6 on a Friday night) I chose to go with the tomato soup based ramen with thick noodles which came with baby shiitake mushrooms, chasu pork, and a sashimi grade jumbo shrimp. The flavour was very sweet, with a strong tomato flavor almost a little bit overpowering, but it tasted so good I finished the bowl before i even realized. I wasnt too sure how the kaedama (extra noodles) worked, but the waiter was nice enough to guide us through it. After ordering kaedama, i finished the noodles just as fast as the first time. Recommend thick noodles for heavier broths like the tonkotsu black, miso black and tomato, which have a lot of flavour that the noodles can grab on to. My overall experience was a 5, i was recommended this place by a friend and thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Toronto EVER!!! Well, that's if you like fresh springy noodles, rich non-msg tonkotsu broth, and smokey, just-the-right-amount-of-fat char siu. We've been to all the downtown ramen places except for Raijin and this is our favourite place in town. Given that we've never been to japan,  and we can't afford a trip out west to Kintaro in Vancouver every time we feel like ramen, this is THE go to place! 5 star!"}
{"text":"We went pretty close to closing time (~30-40 minutes). We were seated promptly and received our food fairly quickly. I thought that the place was much less crowded spacing wise (i.e you aren't sitting beside randoms as seen in other restaurants). I ordered the black tonkatsu thick noodles with extra pork. I thought it tasted great and would definitely return to try the spicy tan tan noodles. This is probably my favourite ramen place in Toronto.    Update: We came here and ordered the Yuzu Panna Cotta during the Millie promotion. I really enjoyed the contrast of the sweet Yuzu honey jelly top with the tangy citrus-y pannacotta bottom. I would recommend coming here before six, as that's when the lines start forming.  I thought the Zangi was okay. There wasn't too much batter and you can actually taste the chicken. However, there are no sauces provided so it might be a bit too plain given the quantity. It could be a good dish to share.   The Spicy Tantan noodles are pretty good. It definitely is spicy so do not underestimate the dish. I liked the broth and thought it wasn't too heavy."}
{"text":"Have to say, this is probably the best ramen joint downtown. I have tried several ramen places in downtown. The broth is super rich. I really like the tonkotsu flavour and the chicken bites are a must try. I only gave a 4 star because of the long wait and squishy table setting."}
{"text":"Another location opened! I have been to the one downtown Toronto and thought I would give the uptown one a try. I have to say, I like the one downtown much better. From the service to the food. I ordered the tonkatsu black which comes with black garlic oil. It is one of the best selling ramens. I would recommend to get the black garlic on the side as they often put too much in the noodles which over powers the soup base. You also have a choice to choose the thin or thick noodles. I would recommend the thick noodles as they are more chewy. The line up is not bad like downtown. You can get a table within minutes depending on the time of day."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was with a group of friends and the service and issues we had were quite atrocious. There was a lipstick stain on my boyfriend's cup when the water glasses arrived. And we later found a piece of plastic in one of the appetizer bowls... Flash forward to about 2 months later, I decided to give this place another try since its so close to work. I tried the Tonkatsu Black with Thick noodles. Service was on point today and broth was to die for..but just a touch too greasy. I think next time I'll stick with regular Tonkatsu. My only criticism this time around is that the portion of noodles was very small especially compared to other places. I would like to see the portions increase just a little more in order to give 5 stars. I usually walk away from a ramen place feeling stuffed to the gills, but not today."}
{"text":"I heard this place is always PACKEDDD. We got lucky and were able to get seats within 15 minutes. If we came 5 minutes later, we would have waited a good 30 minutes.   Ramen, I definitely eat a lot of it. As, I grew up, I had a bowl of soup based noodles everyday, basically ate 5000 bowls of soup based noodles and literally almost every supermarket brand out there (my dad loves soup based noodles, it's practically his coffee).   Um, for $10 a ramen, I definitely expected a lot, but I didn't feel like it was worth it. The noodles, I feel like they taste like a frozen brand that you can buy at the supermarket, with the same soup base, though i felt like Sansotei added a lot of sesame oil and MSG. I really got to praise their smooth egg though, I haven't had something close to it since I went to Tokyo and had their sauna eggs. Of course, it's different, but Sansotei's eggs were quite smooth.   The noodle portion was pretty small for $10, I would pay $6 for this, not $10. Heard they have fried chicken and seaweed salad here for appetizers as well as desserts.   If you like these noodles, go to the supermarket, frozen section and get yourself a pack, add some seasame oil to it and MSG, it'll basically taste the same."}
{"text":"This place is quite small, so make sure you get here early before the lunch rush - it's common to see a small queue forming outside this place. However, the turnover is quite quick so the wait time might not be so terrible if you happen to get stuck in the line.   My lunch partner and I ordered the miso ramen, and a chicken karage to share. We both had the miso ramen with pork shoulder and the thick noodles (they give you a choice of thick vs thin). The noodles were a good thickness, and had a nice chewiness to them. However, I found the broth to be a bit on the salty side, and as a result, I had to keep drinking water to keep the thirst at bay.   The chicken karage was fabulous; it was crispy and juicy. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Tonkatsu Black with thick noodles is proper, get that shit - none of that thin noodle crap."}
{"text":"Had the black tonkotsu ramen with garlic oil & extra chasu. My hubby had the spicy dan dan noodles which had such a wonderful seafood flavour. We also ordered the gyoza in the side. Everything was cooked to perfection, just the most delicious ramen I have ever tasted! Will come back for more in the future!"}
{"text":"This is bar none the best Ramen in town. It's worth the short wait standing outside the restaurant. The food is consistent, the service is quick and friendly, and the prices are really affordable."}
{"text":"The noodles were wonderful.  Nice look and feel to the restaurant. Felt like I was sitting in a noodle shop in Japan. as a matter of fact as soon as I tasted the noodles I booked my next trip to Tokyo three weeks later."}
{"text":"Had a delicious lunch at Sansotei and had to share my experience. We arrived as a party of 3 at 11:40am on a Friday and only had to wait 5 minutes. As this place is growing in popularity, I would suggest arriving no later than 11:30am to avoid a lineup since they make you wait outside along the sidewalk. We were seated by the door so we felt gusts of cold air every time the waitress went outside to add people to the wait list or to call people into their seats. A double door entrance (with an enclosure) would be helpful in this regard.  We ordered the fried chicken appetizer and the tonkatsu ramen with the recommended thin noodles. The appetizer came with five pieces of chicken and a wedge of lemon. it was fried to perfection and the delicious start to our meal.  The noodles arrived shortly after and were absolutely perfect. The eggs were the best  soft-boiled eggs I've ever eaten and the pork (comes with 2 slices) had a beautiful charred surface. The noodles came with a generous portion of wood fungus mushrooms and the soup was not too salty nor too greasy.  Unlike Kinton, the environment is actually conducive to conversation and the seating more comfortable. The service is attentive and polite. My only suggestion is that they serve complimentary hot tea. This seems to be a rarity at downtown Asian restaurants these days but I feel it will complement the food nicely.   Sansotei is winning the Toronto ramen race in my books. Next step, Santouka!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a new location close by! We came in on a week night on a bit of a time crunch and we finished within 20 minutes (I'm a fast eater). The service was so quick! The food came out fast, and although it wasn't hot, it was still a good eating temperature for me.  Taste wise, it is similar to the other locations and still a bit on the saltier side. The soup is still kind of lacking to me. Spicy tan tan is not spicy and tonkotsu black is missing depth... you really only taste the salt. The egg and noodles were great though.   The plaza that it is located in is currently under construction so it is easy to miss from the outside. Inside is newly decorated with mostly two people booths, so prepared if you're coming with a family or bigger group!"}
{"text":"The food is worth 4 stars cos Sansotei Ramen is pretty decent in general. I prefer the tonkotsu black more than the miso black though. Yes the flower is a nice touch but the broth is a bit too salty. For $13.95 miso black, it would be more worth it to get the tonkotsu black and add extra noodles for $1.50 which would come up to be around the same price. Sorry one less star because the waitress forgot we had asked for the bill and the place wasn't busy after 8pm on a weekday night."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese ramen that's not to be missed! It's one of the best bets in the Downtown Toronto area. My personal fave is the Shio ramen.  The queue builds up during peak lunch hours so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out since it was so highly rated, but I didn't like their ramen.  I got the tonkutsu, is it not as good as the other choices?  I guess the broth was just ok, not bad, but not good either.  The ramen was al dente and flavorless.  I did try the fried chicken as well and that was the only good thing about dinner."}
{"text":"FOOD: A good, solid bowl of tonkotsu ramen for just under $10.  I would say it's a medium sized bowl compared to bowls at other ramen restaurants, so I didn't feel I was getting enough bang for my buck.  I was slightly surprised by how light the broth was.  Opaque, sure.  Creamy, enough so.  There was just this brightness to it that I am not sure how to explain.  I would recommend ordering the thick noodle (as opposed to original or thin) to make for a heartier meal.    And oh, just for adorable kicks, when I received my bowl of ramen, the seaweed and the two boiled eggs made for a happy face.  On a very cold, windy night, it was a warm and friendly treat!  SERVICE AND AMBIENCE: Very sweet, prompt, and attentive staff.  They were gracious and patient, when I volunteered to move to the window bar seating when a large party came in, and I was sitting at the only table that could seat them all.  Also, I thankfully arrived before a line started, but they do have a policy of making you wait outside until a table is ready.  There is a windy draft by the door, so on cold days, keep your coat on!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried their Spicy Tan Tan and Tonkotsu Black Ramen (with thin noodles).  They were both flavourful -but I do have to say that their broth isn't comparable to Santouka or Ramen Isshin's. They also don't have many topping options -no corn!!!!   The restaurant is small and has limited seating so you do have to split tables with other patrons. Make sure you don't bring a big purse like I did when I went, oops!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. Still had to wait outside which I hate as it was windy and cold. The service is friendly tho. The soup and pork is really well done. Pork is nice, flavourful and soft. Soup is enriched with pork bone flavour. However, really disappointed with the noodles. It wasn't as El Dante as I would have liked. It was a little on the soggy side."}
{"text":"Fast turnaround time. And without feeling rushed to dine and get out.  Great food. Fave is spicy tantan.  Great service. Always attentive."}
{"text":"The first time I was here I thought it was amazing - best ramen I've ever had! The second time I went it was mediocre. The broth was too salty and just wasn't as amazing as I remember. Will probably go back ...... but not often."}
{"text":"The spicy thin noodle was great, not to much... not to little. Great flavours... very very happy. O yes the mango cheese cake was wonderful also. I would have showed you but all gone haha"}
{"text":"Our favourite place for ramen. It is so good! At peak times there may be a short wait for a table but it is well worth it. We tried the fried chicken for the first time today. It was excellent. Nice and juicy with good flavour. Fast and friendly service. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and the wait wasn't too bad.  This was at 6:00 so we waited about 15 mins on a Saturday night for 4 adults and 3 kids.  We were surprised to get a high chair!  Service was quick and they even provided us with an ingredients list when we asked what certain items contained.  I ordered the shoyu flavor and wasn't impressed.  The noodles were good but I didn't like the soup base much.  I got to try some of the spicy tan tan and that was delicious as was the tonkotsu black.  We also had a couple orders of the slow cooked chicken wings which were delicious if you could take the heat.  The menu did not say that they were spicy wings so half of the table including the kids could not eat them. It was very hot (not sure if the A/C was working or not) and got slightly uncomfortable especially while eating piping hot noodles.  Would definitely go back though and get the spicy tan tan or tonkotsu black flavors."}
{"text":"We love ramen and used to drive downtown to get some.  Now that there's a Sansotei uptown near us it's even better.  The taste is pretty much the same as what you'd get downtown.  The tonkatsu black is the best.  Very flavourful and rich!"}
{"text":"Heads up, there are no reservations here. Everyone gets to line up, and lining up is expected.  I heard Sansotei was the best place in Toronto to get ramen. For the longest time, I've been wondering whether this was actually true, and that I would be blown away when I tried it, or whether it was hype that had driven up the appeal. Perhaps that claim to fame is location specific, but this location didn't particularly wow me. I'm also not saying it was bad. I just wasn't wowed.   Service was attentive, but on a peculiar note, our main server referred to one of the members in my party as 'dude'. It was surprisingly casual. Another strange thing was that another server bought cups of water, and two of them were fairly full and did not have straws, and the other two were between halfway and two thirds of the way filled and had straws in them. There's a lack of consistency there that concerns me. My first thought was that they had given us two cups of water another table hadn't finished off. I'm really hoping that wasn't the case.  I ordered the tonkotsu black, with the garlic oil on the side (a friend recommended it on the side so that if I didn't want it all in my ramen, I could choose how much to pour in). Upon receiving it, I poured almost all of it in. The rest went in my cousin's bowl. As per their website's recommendations, I ordered it with thin noodles. After my first bite, I began regretting not getting the thicker noodles. For me, ramen is about the broth. I expected this broth to be significantly more porky. The predominant flavor in the broth was actually salt. That was a letdown. Perhaps it would have been better with thicker noodles. I have a feeling thicker noodles would have cut down some of that salty flavor in the broth. That's just a hunch though. The black garlic oil wasn't particularly wowing either. The chashu was not particularly impressive either. It wasn't especially tender, not was it especially flavorful. The soft boiled egg was lovely, but if they botched that up, they really don't deserve to be called the best.   For $9.85, it was an okay bowl of ramen. I wasn't completely full, but I was satisfied. Actually, I don't think I would have wanted more, had it come with more. Too much salt. I wouldn't mind coming again, but I wouldn't say I would crave Sansotei. I prefer Aka-Oni's ramen. For about the same price, I get a larger portion, more toppings, and their chashu is smokey tasting. I can also make a reservation."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ramen place in all of Toronto.  I'm only disappointed that sansotei no longer serves its original noodles. (Which were the best tasting noodles out of the options they have, here's hoping that they read this and bring it back) but regardless, the ramen broth was excellent, the noodles were still great, the eggs were just the right consistency, and everything tasted delicious.  They also have mochi on the dessert menu which are fantastic. It comes in twos- great for sharing and there are different flavours. Their cheesecake is also to die for. I highly recommend checking out this little ramen shop. Even if you have to wait outside (there's no room to wait inside the restaurant), the wait isn't terribly long. I waited around 15mins on an evening one weekend, it was well worth the effort!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best ramen place in the Markham area. It was my first time going, and assuming it has been open for a while, I thought there would be no line ups. I was wrong! At 9 pm on a Friday there was still a 20 minute wait! The servers were very friendly, and I loved the soup bases !"}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointed that the tomato ramen has changed to shrimp. The scallop was much better so I hope they bring it back.  The shrimp was average size but the scallop made the ramen so much more special.   The wait was quick for dinner and they did not rush us as we stayed for more than an hour. Service was great and we got a regular table instead of the ones by the wall. Not sure what to order next time as that was my favorite."}
{"text":"Be prepared to line up for lunch and dinner at this ramen shop. This winter was especially cold lining up but sitting next to the door was no better.  I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes before the lunch rush and was awarded with a table by the door. To make matters worse, the waitress took our orders but forgot to send it to the kitchen. We were waiting 20 minutes for our noodles while the patrons, who arrived later, were enjoying their food. We decided to call a waitress over to ask about our order and were quick to bring us the food with an apology.  The ramen was great with amazing pieces of pork and choice of thick or thin noodles. After being filled up, we were hoping for a discount but were disappointed when none was offered."}
{"text":"My brother and I ordered their Tonkotsu Black, gyoza and Zangi.   Their ramen broth was very flavourful, the pork belly was very delicious, not too chewy, soft and tender and easy to swallow. The egg was boiled perfectly ( as some may over boil their eggs) and the noodles absorbed their broth flavour. I would just like my ramen a bit hotter.   Gyoza was good. Good flavour, fried well. Typical nothing too outstanding.   Zangi was pretty good! I loved how it was so tender on the inside and juicy but on the outside ( with a drizzle of lemon) and crispy on the outside!   Service was good, the waitresses were nice and served us well and gave us water right away.   Location is decent. Downtown, close to the subway station and bus stops. The restaurant space is a bit small...  Overall we are very satisfied, we would just suggest the broth to be a bit hotter and recommend a bigger area."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourites. I can't tell how happy i am now that they are in Markham. Sansotei, thanks for being so close to us.  Review: Place: In the inside, nice looking and keeping the look of a traditional Japanese restaurant, no much to say, since they are doing a great job with the decoration, the problem is the size... If the restaurant could held at least 60 ppl would have been amazing so customers wouldn't need to wait for so long. I kno, is not their fault, we all love Ramen.  Service: As everyone are Japanese, they all keep their well manners and traditions, each of them are always friendly.  Food: Same quality and quantity as the one located in Downtown, please never change, but add more options so we can keep coming back.  Final Comments: Just go, you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"The soup broth is too salty?the quality and quantility of this Ramen joint is very disappointing. Will not come back again."}
{"text":"Ive been wanting to try this place for months but the line ups in the past have been too crazy. Came for lunch on a Thursday at noon and while it was busy, they were able to seat us immediately which was a nice surprise.   The menu was short, with only 4-5 ramen soup flavours. I chose the tonkatsu while my friend had the spicy one. The soup broth was quite tasty and just salty enough, although i found the meat a little bland. Eggs were cooked perfectly, and the noodles were ok and fair portion size.   Service was quick and friendly, and the price was decent ($10-12). But it still didnt make it to my top favourite Ramen houses, and I don't think its worth the long line ups - but it's decent. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Hella delicious and so filling! I am lucky I work walking distance from here. They are usually pretty busy, but the service is great and they really are fast. The ramen is filling and very flavourful. It is worth waiting in line for."}
{"text":"Went at 5:30 today and just beat the crowd.  Parking is a bit of a pain before 6pm since no stopping on Yonge-after looping around we got lucky and found a spot in front.  Service is very polite and fast.  The ambiance and decor is very trendy and comfortable.  The broth is very tasty and the noodles is just right.  I loved the egg which is why I ordered an extra one.  The pork and scallop is very good and not artificial.     Short and simple menu (posted on my pics).  One of the better ramen places in the city for sure.  What else can I say?l"}
{"text":"One of the best ramen I've had.  The broth is nice, not too salty and I think that there's little to no MSG since I wasn't dying from thirst afterward.  Portion size is just right, I ordered the Tonkatsu(?) with black garlic.    The only thing I wish they had was either a little waiting area, or a bigger restaurant.  Waiting outside  with -30C windchill for 30 something minutes was bone chilling."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after several attempts to eat here. The lines on the other days I came here were out the door (even in rainy days). Hubby and I got here around 5:15pm and snagged the second last booth spot before the lineups started.  I ordered the Tonkatsu with thick noodles. Hubby ordered the spicy TanTan soup, also with thick noodles at the waitress's recommendation. At my cousin's suggestion, we also ordered extra noodles to help finish off the broth leftover after we finished the noodles that came with the soup serving. Each bowl came complete with soft boiled eggs, bamboo shoots, & thin slices of pork belly, the latter which was a bit thinner and fattier than the pork slices that I am used to at other ramen places.  We also ordered the spicy slow cooked chicken wings, which were reminiscent of Filipino chicken adobo (soy and garlic flavoured) with a spicy kick. I was expecting a crispier skin on the wings, rather than the rubbery skin that was on them. Still didn't stop me from eating my half of the order because I was starving!  After our soup and chicken wings, hubby and I were pretty full, and frankly felt a bit rushed to pay our bill because of the line growing out the door. However since we were not sure when we will be able to eat here again, we took the opportunity to get some of the matcha cheesecake to go. Boy was it good! In my opinion, it is not too sweet but has a good amount of matcha flavour and tastes better than Uncle Tetsu cheesecake. I would go back for the cheesecake alone! Alas they do not offer takeout so I may need to brave the line ups next time I want my next Sansotei ramen and matcha cheesecake fix"}
{"text":"TL;DR: This location isn't as good as the one downtown. They food was alright at best, but I find the portions a bit small. The location is also pretty small, so expect a wait during peak hours. If you come during non-peak hours (say after 8:30PM), there usually isn't a line; even on weekends.  Food (3/5):  I was super excited when I heard that Sansotei opened a Markham location when this first opened. I have had this a total of 3 times, and every time, the food was mediocre. It was definitely on the more expensive foods around the area for the amount of food that you get. If you do come here, I would recommend you get the Tonkotsu because that is the one I enjoyed the most. Honestly, go to the downtown location or another ramen shop if you're really craving it. I would not recommend this place unless it is the only place that is opened or if you're really really craving ramen.     Service (4.5/5):  Despite their food being pricey and mediocre, I would say that their service is great. You can easily get their attention, and they always have a smile on their faces. They forgot about placing one of our orders once, and provided us with a 25% discount on the entire bill after we told them to place it again (not many places in Markham / Richmond hill would do that. They usually just say you can cancel it and apologize).   ------- Overall (3 - 3.5/5)"}
{"text":"Ramen here is SO tasty. When ramenmania hit Toronto, I tried couple of places and didn't really understand what the hype was all about. I mean it was pretty good, but....  Well Sansotei ramen is GREAT and I now totally get it. The flavors are just so nice and tasty. This is really hard to explain in writing so please do yourself a favor and try it. It's really cheap too!"}
{"text":"After reading all about this shop, I had to visit here.  First of all, line-up is crazy. So with that, I was expecting out-of-this-world kind of food. c'mon it's dundas and University - there's a LOT of restaurants. And if the line is out the door on the sidewalk 15 people long on a tuesday evening... I expect awesome.  And nope.... The soup I wanted was out. -_- And then I asked the server to recommend something else, but there's only a few things to pick from. And the server kind of said that two of the soups are kind of the same, and the other ones are just bland. well that's nice. Eventually I got two different ramen soups. Both are extremely salty! I don't remember tasting anything else except salt. I think I liked the thick noodle option better just cuz that kind of cuts the salt a bit.   Anyway, in short - not living up to the hype. and definitely not worth the wait. Now everytime when i pass by the shop and see the massive lineup, I just smile and keep on walking."}
{"text":"It's been a few weeks since Husband and I along with a friend experienced Sansotei's ramen, and we're still dreaming about it.  Why is it so special? It's the BROTH you guys!! Oh, and it's an excellent one at that. I can't even extract all the adjectives from my head to describe how incredible it is. You can tell how much time and love is put into the slow cooking of the pork bones to develop a rich and flavorful broth. Without it, ramen is not magical.  The three of us arrived around 1:45pm on a Saturday. We thought coming after the normal lunch hour would yield us a minimal to no wait, but we were WRONG! :) There were 4 other couples in front of us, and we were all waiting patiently along the sidewalk. Thankfully, the weather was brisk and cool. We ended up waiting about 20 minutes, so not too bad. Our friend wasn't as patient, but luckily, it was well worth it!  The space itself, as others have noted, is pretty small, but typical for city ramen shops. What we liked about it was that it wasn't super loud, so we could actually enjoy our meal and not have to shout to talk.  Menu is small, but I love that. We went with the Tonkotsu Black, which is basically the pork broth ramen with garlic green onion oil. Each bowl starts at $9.80, and if you want extra noodles (which our friend did get), it's an additional $1. Swimming inside the silky broth is a soft boiled egg, that's executed PERFECTLY. When I bit into it, it was like a dream..silky, soft, and a slight runny yolk. In addition to that, the bamboo shoots were soft and not tough to bite. Pork belly was sliced thinly, and a generous 5 slices to boot. The amount of oil gave it that extra pop to the broth. To round out the bowl, woodear mushrooms were a nice touch and appropriately crisp.  I had the thick noodles and Husband had the thin noodles. Both were good, though if you like more bite to your noodles, get the thick ones. I enjoyed both equally, but favor the thin just a little more. Our friend who ordered extra noodles was surprised at how much they give. He was stuffed to the max at the end of the day!  The three of us split the zangi (fried chicken). Good crisp and not heavy. A good snack, but you can easily get full off of the bowl of noodles, something that doesn't happen too often at a ramen shop.  I haven't been to the other location, but considering we had such a great time here at their original one, I'm not sure we will. The wait is so worth it, and I didn't even think it was that bad. Now the question is, when can we go back? lol"}
{"text":"I don't think I've had a bad experience here! Definitely am a fan. BF and I really enjoying coming to this location as there is parking in front and the staff are hospitable :) We came here on a Wednesday (that really cold night of December 2017) around 9PM and wanted something to warm our tummies for dinner.   My go to is the spicy tantan ramen (less salt, thin noodles) which has: chashu, a soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, ground pork and shredded chilli pepper with thin noodles (despite Sansotei recommending thick noodles) with less salt. The noodles are always perfect cooked al dente and ready to be slurped up ^^; BF got the tonkotsu black, which is the regular tonkotsu (Tonkotsu is topped off with 2 pieces of chashu, a soft boiled egg, black fungus and green onion) but with garlic oil~   I don't normally finish the broth after finishing the noodles with toppings as I find it's too heavy, but there is lots of flavour and definition every sip of the way.   We also ordered their kaarage and the breading wasn't too thick and the chicken was marinated and had the perfect crunch.  Will be back =)"}
{"text":"My coworker suggested this place for dinner; I was pleasantly surprised after finding out this location had opened up.  Came here around 8pm after Pokemon hunting in the Main St area, and found out it'd be a 20 min wait. We lucked out and were seated at the bar as we were only 2 ppl. In terms of seating, majority of it is booth seating with a few tables (this location is a bit smaller). I ordered the Tonkotsu black ramen with thin noodles that was topped with slices of pork belly, black fungus, green onion and a soft boiled egg. Service is quick after you order and I have noticed the waitresses here are more attentive compared to the downtown locations ^_^  (Ahh) just like I remember -- the pork broth not too salty but also flavourful."}
{"text":"THIS is the best ramen in toronto? Really??! SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED..  The first time I tried to come here, it was closed because it was sunday .. what restaurant COMPLETELY closes on sundays?! What??  Today was a monday and I came here after hearing from many yelpers and friends that sansotei is #1 in toronto ..  First, the store is SUPER small.. probably the smallest ramen place I've ever been to. I'm also not a fan of the 'community tables' where everyone has to sit together at one long table.. especially when you have 2 people and you have to sit side by side facing some random strangers. I also didn't enjoy the old chinese lady eyeing me up and down for about 5 minutes after I sat down at her table .. I hope you like what you saw, lady. Sansotei only has 1-2 booths where you can actually sit alone with whoever is keeping you company..  The menu is pretty small with basic stuff like gyoza/edamame etc. The ramen has different soup bases and you can add extra stuff to it.  The ramen sizes were not huge.. they're pretty small actually - this is not a problem for me because I don't eat big portions anyway so I was stuffed, but my boyfriend was STILL hungry after eating. \"$22 for two bowls of ramen and I'm still going to head to mcdonalds to hit up 2 more junior chickens. Not worth it\" - words from the boyfriend.  The ramen is ok.. I actually enjoyed the pork in it- it was not completely soft/fatty pork belly (which I hate). It was actually crunchy and flavourful. The noodles were texturized but standard. And the best part was the broth, which was rich but not oily- a lot of ramen places cannot get this part right. I recommend the black tonkotsu!  Service was quick and ramen came super quick.  I didn't have to wait in line because I came at around 5:30pm but when I was leaving, there were people lining up OUTSIDE, on the street.. now that's something you don't see often.   Overall, I wouldn't come back here. I can say I've tried it, but the hype is just hype. NOT IMPRESSED."}
{"text":"This is pretty good for Markham food.  After recently turning vegan again, I decided this would be my farewell to meat/dairy/animal products because I can't go without trying the one place that is soo hyped in Markham.  I came in and sat down within seconds, because 0 wait! Woooo! Communal tables are not my thing. It's a cool concept but eh.. my social anxiety can do without it. Glancing at the menu, I realized there is nothing I can eat here when I become full-vegan.. shame. :'( The menu isn't big by any means and the portions remain the same as the downtown location- tiny. After picking out the pork belly and egg out of my tonkotsu black ramen, I was left with a salty and rich broth that totally screamed 'sodium is running through your veins tonight, girl!' The noodles had a nice chewy texture that I found to be quite enjoyable. For some reason, I liked it a lot more than I did the downtown location. The restaurant is a lot bigger too and can definitely seat a lot more people. They also aren't understaffed like the other location, which really helps make a dining experience better.   Although I won't.. or can't.. be eating here anymore, I highly recommend doing so because it's one of the better ramen joints in Markham.  Shoutout to the kitchen staff for doing a great and fast job. Especially you, Tim ;)"}
{"text":"Great place for Ramen. I'm a fan of the Spicy Tan Tan. Miso black is also a great try. Appetizers are okay and great to share amongst the group. The overall proportions are a tad bit short for its price."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in the city! Try the TONKOTSU BLACK It is killer!!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place due to the line ups outside while other ramen places nearby you could just walk in, wasn't disappointed! The menu was simple but the broth in the ramen was amazing. Service was great!"}
{"text":"I was impressed. They have the best ramen I have tasted in Toronto. Absolutely delicious. I had the tonkatsu black and I loved it."}
{"text":"I thought that the north york location would be less busy, but there was still line ups which are worth waiting for. I ordered the favourite and regular ramen : Tonkotsu black ramen. Food was good, service was good. And i like that the washrooms are not in the basement unlike other sansotei locations."}
{"text":"Sansotei has been my first and favourite ramen place since I first went 2 years ago. I really like the noodle and the soup. Me and my bf went on Monday around 3.30pm and it was one of the rare times when we didn't have to queue. As usual, he got spicy tantan and I got Tonkotsu black. Sansotei never disappoints :) will definitely go again and again."}
{"text":"As far as ramen goes, Sansotei is as good as it gets. Good soup and good noodles. But be wary of the sodium, it's just too much.  I would like to say I am not the biggest ramen fan. The idea of a 10 dollar bowl of noodles with one egg, two pieces of pork belly, and miscellaneous items doesn't have the biggest appeal but I can appreciate it. It can make for a warm, and hearty meal.    I've tried Sansotei downtown and found the Markham location just as good. I haven't tried the spicy tan tan (sesame) but have tried the tonkotsu ones and were disappointed. The salt just overpowers everything, and it's hard to enjoy the dish. I found spicy tan tan much better! It's less pungent and the heat provides a nice little kick. Do pair the spicy tan tan with thick noodles, it compliments better.   As far the individual components of the ramen go, they really are amazing. The egg is perfectly soft boiled, the pork belly is tender. The noodles are perfectly cooked firm yet with a nice chew. The broth is rich, unfortunately just overdone with salt.   Service was great and quick. We came on the weekend before 6pm and were instantly seated. This place was packed with a lineup just after 6 but with a quick turnaround time the wait shouldn't be too long.  I will definitely be back and can easily say Sansotei will be my ramen of choice uptown. Uptown ramen lovers can rejoice!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sansotei a few times. Their menu is simple and easy to navigate, which I like. I've tried their Shoyu Ramen, which comes with pork belly, egg, bamboo shoot, and green onion. It's quite good, probably one of my favourites there. Recently, I also tried the Spicy Tantan, which has minced pork and bean sprouts in addition to the ingredients in Shoyu. I didn't really like it, it was way too salty. I had to down 2 cups of water after. My advice is to stay away from this one, but all other ramens are quite good."}
{"text":"4.5 stars   Tonkatsu ramen was perfection. Service was really quick as well! I like the layout of the restaurant too - unlike Kinton Ramen, the seats are actually semi-comfortable and you don't have to worry as much about bringing in too many belongings with you. You still have the same modern, ramen-shop vibe at Sansotei minus the uncomfortable seats. The only downsides are the small size of the restaurant and the fact that you can't see the chefs preparing your ramen."}
{"text":"Had the miso black ramen and the Zangi fried chicken. Ramen was very flavourful with a rich mushroom flavour, good tender pork (other places over \"blowtorch\" the chasu which makes it tough, that wasn't an issue here). I would've liked more breading on the chicken to make it crispier."}
{"text":"After many many visits to the Markham location I was excited to see a Richmond Hill location open up very close to me. This is one of my most favorite ramen restaurants ever. I was excited when I came to the parking lot and saw the fresh new restaurant that had just opened. What I walked in I immediately noticed the clean quiet atmosphere that was welcoming and comfortable. My girlfriend and I quickly received a table as there was no wait at 5:30 p.m. we ordered our usual bowls of ramen except this time my Ramen was surprisingly not salty enough. Typically when I go to this restaurant in Markham it is the perfect amount of salty but this visit was disappointing in the fact that it was probably healthier for me to get this Ramen than the usual when I get. The service was kind and friendly. The kitchen look clean the restaurant was even cleaner and the bathroom was so clean I could probably eat off the floor but never would. I would highly recommend this to anyone in the Richmond Hill area looking for an authentic Ramen dish that has amazingly Quick Service from ordering to table. The only reason I gave this place a 4 out of 5 stars is because I was sadly disappointed by the lack of consistency from location to location. Other than that my girlfriends dish was perfect and I highly recommend this place. It seems as though the lineup starts around 6 or 6:30 p.m. so come early and bring an appetite."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for ramen. I have been to other ramen restaurants before and no where I have ever been has been as good as this place. I always get the same thing and I'm so happy. Today my girlfriend ordered a beer and we ordered chicken as an appetizer. I don't suggest going anywhere else for ramen as this is the best place in Toronto and Markham."}
{"text":"The best ramen Ever! We order The shoyu And tantan. Nice broth And noodles . Perfect! The gyoza and beef with Rice was also Good. The Cherry blossoms cake is also Very tasty."}
{"text":"One of the best Ramen I had. It was amazing everything in that Ramen was done to perfection. I love it and I will go back there anytime. God job guys."}
{"text":"The four star are solely for their ramen. Not putting into account the price, the waiting, the service, or the restaurant ambiance. I ordered Spicy Tantan ramen with thick noodles and my husband ordered the Tonkotsu ramen. We both agreed the spicy tantan taste better, very good balance of flavorful soup, perfect chewy noodles, refreshing bean sprout and bamboo shoot, chasu was good (not melt in your mouth kind, not chewy either, but not so flavorful either). As for the Tonkotsu ramen with thick noodle, the soup has overwhelming pork flavor, still pretty good ramen overall. We will come back for more ramen, definetly one of the best ramen in town."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always leave here satisfied. Wish there were more locations so the lineup would be less"}
{"text":"The devil is in the details for a great bowl of ramen and sansotei definitely pays attention. I've been to various ramen places before and was really able to taste the difference here. First thing that hit me walking through the door was the fantastic smell of steamy roasted pork filling the room.. Such a warm and delicious aroma.   It took me a good 10 minutes to finally decide on the tonkotsu black (garlic oil added to the original tonkotsu) since I've literally waited a few years now before coming here to avoid the infamous lineups. Friends.. Trust me and try this! The garlic oil adds so much additional dimension and kickass flavour - I was worried it might make the soup too salty but I found it to be the perfect balance and didn't overpower the original rich and creamy soup base.   The ramen noodles had great chewy texture and I personally prefer the thin over thick noodles as I think it absorbs more of the flavours. The pork slices were pan seared with a caramelized crust and the egg was also perfectly soft and yolky.   Can't believe it took me so long to finally try their ramen AND with no lineup at 7pm on a Tuesday night! So there we have it - fav ramen place in the city!"}
{"text":"Very cute interior! Nice wooden theme with ropes. Also very clean. You can place your belongings under your seat in a basket!  Tonkotsu black $11.75 Thin noodles - I like the texture! Almost like buckwheat noodles. Very fresh!!  The fungi was fresh too!  Nice creamy pork broth Garlic was a little too charred. Garlic oil flavour was a little too subtle.  One bowl seems small but is surprisingly extremely filling. You'll feel it after 5 min :)  Want to come back for the lunch special $15 for pop+ramen+dessert"}
{"text":"I heard/read this was the best ramen in Toronto, so I had to stop by! My brother is also a HUGE fan of ramen...so much that he basically had 1.5 ramens (my mom claimed she wasn't that hungry).  We didn't realize that we would have to wait outside in a line so we actually didn't bring out jackets with us from the parking garage across the street (BIGGG mistake). So unfortunately we had to stand outside huddled for about 15 minutes. The wait wasn't that long as they are super fast with making the ramen.  My brother and I both ordered the miso ramen and my mom the shoyu ramen - all with thick noodles. I didn't realize that he tonkotsu ramen was their specialty or else I would have tried that!! The pork is by far the best I've had at any ramen place I've been. The broth I would say is just okay and on the salty side.  Overall an enjoyable place for ramen!!"}
{"text":"Got the tonkutsu ramen for a quick very late lunch at 3pm and therefore, had no trouble waiting for the food, I was served immediately and the food came very fast as well.   The birth was very very flavourful, a strong richness from the pork and you could almost taste the collagen from the bones with the stickiness of the broth. The noodles were nice and chewy, the bamboo shoots very \"crunchy\" and the meat was melt in your mouth.   The overall ramen was a bit too salty for my liking, as I got towards the end of the bowl, I was having a harder and harder time finishing the bowl due to the saltiness, but it was nothing overbearing."}
{"text":"Visited last night with bae on a crazy cold night (oh hello -30 wind chill!) and enjoyed our meal.  Since this place is busy and the resto is small, they have a sign on the front window explaining you need to line up to wait. Oh Toronto, how we love waiting in lines. And we did. LOL!  There were four people ahead of us when we got there and we probably only waited about 10 minutes or so. Once inside, we were super cozy and the restaurant smelled incredible.  We ordered goyza, bae got the miso black ramen and I selected the tomato ramen for my main.  My fiance decided not to tell me he knew the tomato ramen comes with a giant prawn, head intact. He thought this was really hilarious. I know this is not a big deal for most people but just personal preference, I don't enjoy my meal staring back at my from the bowl. Oh wells!!  Our ramen arrived hot and steaming. Super flavourful and the noodles were delicious. I dug my shrimp friend out of my bowl and he was our dining companion for the evening. I did eventually end up eating the tail, which was tasty.  Personally, I would not rush back but only because I prefer a veggie option for my ramen (some peeps may roll their eyes but I try to avoid meat when I can lol).  All of that having been said - Overall, we enjoyed and would recommend to ramen lovers!"}
{"text":"Yay an uptown location for real ramen!  Came here on a Friday night for dinner around 7pm, the wait was about 30 minutes and the line is formed outside and it was cold which wasnt the greatest. The inside is spacious and had a lot more seating than the downtown location.  We got the karrage to share, it was freshly fried and you can't really do wrong with fried chicken. I decided to try the spicy tan tan noodles here, the thick noodles were nice and chewy, however I wish there was more ground pork and it wasn't very spicy as I wanted it to be. I would just go with the regular tonkotsu ramen next time.  The service was quick, attentive and nice so nothing to complain about there. It is a good place just the wait feels too long sometimes."}
{"text":"Sansotei is always my go-to ramen place. Very friendly restaurant -- it's pretty intimate and the decoration is modern. Ordered the Tonkotsu and the broth was just amazing. Noodles were chewy, chashu and eggs were perfectly cooked. Excellent food! Great customer service! This place is a must go for ramen lovers!"}
{"text":"Sansotei is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the GTA. Very nice addition to Mississauga, right next to entrance 9 at Square One. Both environment and service were good. Staff were very friendly and attentive. Got the Miso Black Ramen and wasn't disappointed with the quality of the food. Broth was so rich, noodles were chewy, chashu and egg were perfectly cooked. Much better than Kinton. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"As usually, there is a bit of a line. But that's a good thing! Food was only Ok. The noodles for some reason seemed kind of hard, bu maybe that's how Ramen is supposed to be. But otherwise, service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this restaurant.   Atmosphere: The restaurant is very narrow and seats about 20 guests at most. Communal seating is necessary, so not the place to go if you're not in the mood to socialize with strangers (or at least bear through slightly awkward interactions).   Service: Service was prompt and friendly. No complaints about the staff.   Menu: There is the usual range of ramen broths on the menu, but no choice between pork belly or shoulder. The soft-boiled egg could have been seasoned better, but overall a very good ramen bowl. I would highly recommend the tonkotsu black with either noodle type. The ramen bowls cost between $10.50-12, so very reasonable."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday with some coworkers and still had to wait in line! It wasn't too long though, maybe about 15 minutes? When we left at 1 pm ghere wasn't a line so I would definitely come after the lunch crowd.  Food came pretty quickly, I ordered the Tonkatsu Black with thin noodles and it was really really delicious!! Very aromatic and broth was very rich. A bit on the salty side but definitely very good. I think next time I will try the thicker noodles cause the thin ones were a bit soft. I like my noodles with a bit more bite to it! XD  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delectable ramen! Sansotei's signature black garlic oil tonkotsu ramen is a better version of the kind served at Ippudo (in NYC) and Agu Ramen (in Honolulu). While for me, there is something almost cutting and non-edible-seeming about that black garlic oil at first, here, it becomes almost synergetic and tastier as it blends with the broth. It is definitely good and as delicious as a black oil slick can taste. And I do love me a marinated soft boiled egg, aijitama!, but I can't get over how cold it is here. There's gotta be a way to make that warmer without jeopardizing the ooze of the yolk, seriously.    Communal tables, um hope you like that! I was sandwiched between an awkward date and a group of ramen newbies who were trying to decipher the menu while returning to their conversation of why pepsi reigns supreme over coke. Ok. But that's also the charm too, although I know a lot of folks don't want to be that close to people while they're inhaling their day's worth of calories in a meal. With that in mind, maybe this isn't the best place for a date, but more of a cozy-come-with-a-good-friend or even alone kind of place, since the seating is tight.   Lastly, the cheesecake looked so delicious and I will have to try that on my next trip along with the tan tan men. Hmmm...I wish I had two stomaches.  All in all, this place is great. Great value. Al dente noodles, soft pork, and full bodied broth make for a perfect antidote to a cold blustery evening."}
{"text":"The ramen is a little bit salty but overall excellent. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Best Japanese Style noodles in town.  The town of Markham where there's a S Tonne or noodle places.       Go try it but they take a sleep break at 2:30pm so watch the time."}
{"text":"This should really be a 3.5 star rating but Yelp doesn't allow it. Out of the ramen joints I've been to, this was so far the best. My tonkotsu black was really delicious. My date said his shoyu ramen was ok, \"not bad I guess,\" and found mine on the salty side. The reason why I couldn't give this place 4 stars though is because many of the veggies you'd expect in a bowl of ramen are considered extras. If you want corn, you have to pay extra. If you want bamboo, that's extra too. Pretty ridiculous how much a  bowl of ramen could add up to. The tofu cheesecake also wasn't exaxtly stellar. I'm sure it goes without saying that it's a long wait at their Markham location even during lunch hour but it's not too, too bad. Oh, and if you wanted to order the sides and crepe cake, they are only available at their downtown location."}
{"text":"Yes.  Best. Ramen. Ever.  We were in Toronto, feeling like ramen, so we checked yelp for best ramen in Toronto, and Sansotei was on top of the list.  We went and the place was worth all the hipe. Best ramen ever. We ordered 4 different ramens, and lots of other stuff for our group, I tried it all, and I wanted ti finish every last bowl, so good it was.  Service was quick and efficient too. If I lived nearby I'd go there every frikin day.  Tip: seating is quite limited, so you'll might have to wait (on the street) if go during rush hour."}
{"text":"We were so excited to find a local Ramen shop so you can only imagine we got to Sansotei as soon as we got a chance. The decor were beautiful and the staff is very friendly. This is a great spot if you're in the area and don't feel like commuting. It will satisfy your ramen fix. Noodles were perfect - nice and chewy. The soup missed the mark for me. It didn't have the depth of flavour, more like soup base from packaged noodles."}
{"text":"Consistently: Quality. Don't eat at normal meal times to avoid the rush. Every menu item is good - tonkotsu and tantan are my preferred bowls. Gyozas are cute and delicious. Service is fast and friendly; food is on table in under 12 minutes."}
{"text":"Favourite ramen place in Toronto!! The waitresses are so sweet and the portions are huge. I absolutely love their ramen but it's really the service that makes this my favourite ramen place in Toronto."}
{"text":"There is a line-up outside but as soon as you get in, the service is fast. I had the tonkotsu. The broth and noodles were nice but the toppings can be better. The chashu tasted AND looked like it was frozen (definitely not fresh+thick cut) and the egg was cold in the centre which made my ramen lukewarm. Ramen needs to be piping hot."}
{"text":"So happy when i found out Sansotei opened another restaurant in the city, this one, VERY close to my house in Markham!  This place is definitely bigger than the Eaton Center location, but with so many people in Markham excited about a legit ramen place opened in the area, there is always a lineup here even if you go early like at 6!  I waited around 20 minutes with my friend before we were seated.  Seating room is comfortable, they always try to leave a seat in between the two parties even when you are sitting at the same long table.  Menu is exactly the same as the downtown location.  I went with my traditional Tonkotsu Black ramen with thick noodle, less oil and extra noodle!  Taste pretty much the same as the one in downtown, so I was satisfy!  Just a tip, I highly recommend ordering the THICK ramen over the THIN one, it just gives you that much better texture and this is ramen!  It's supposed to be chewy!!"}
{"text":"Waiting in line (because 8/10 times there IS one), I already had high expectations (apparently this is THE best ramen in town). It didn't disappoint though. The ramen was delicious and what I enjoyed even more was the fried chicken I ordered on the side."}
{"text":"I've had Sansotei so many times and this  location disappoints me. The soup is overly salty and my zangi was over fried."}
{"text":"We got lucky as we got there just after they opened on Sunday morning. Whenever I pass this place by, there is always a long line up.  Great service and the location is convenient!   I ordered tomato ramen (wanted to try something new) and it was so good! There was a huge scallop which was the highlight of the dish. It was tender and cooked perfectly. The broth and the noodles were delicious too. Because I tend to go for less oily broth for ramen, it was a good choice for me. My bf has been there many times, and he says all the other menus are good too.  Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a bowl of ramen to warm up.  You can also get cheese cake from Uncle tetsu because these two places are close to each other!  I will go back again to try there most popular ramen."}
{"text":"Great, delicious, simple and so gorgeous! The restaurant is very clean and its fairly open concept, can see in the kitchen - it is pristine clean. You can see how your bowl is being prepared - with care and great attention.  Very happy they opened a location in Richmond hill, hope to see another one in Aurora/Newmarket! (There is a T&T coming soon))"}
{"text":"Too much hype, and ramen is just average. Had gastrointestinal problems for 2 days after this meal. Too fatty, too much oil. Don't think I'll be returning. Also, tea is $2.00, and its nothing special (I'm used to getting complimentary tea at ramen restaurants)"}
{"text":"This is probably the second best ramen place I've ever been to. Better than Ippudo yo in New York, on par with many places in LA, but not quite as good as my favorite ramen place in SF (waraku ramen izakaya) The tonkotsu broth was so rich, and I had mine with black garlic oil which definitely added a lot of wholesome flavor. Great dish during the winter in Toronto."}
{"text":"Excellent service with tasty broth in their ramen bowls. I just wish they were a tad bit larger in size. You have to be there before they open to be able to be seated promptly."}
{"text":"Nothing much to say that hasn't been said before, but it is the place to be for ramen. You have to make sure to come early before 6pm to avoid line ups for dinner, but the staff does a respectful job to keep a continuous flow without making the previous customers feel like they're being kicked out to make room!   I had the spicy tantan and it was one of the better ramen version if the tantan noodles that I've had with just the right amount of spice and saltiness level. Noodles were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Ramen is good, not a lot of seats, but it's in downtown, so what can you expect. It's good ramen, can you say its the best? There's never the best ramen. The best ramen is when you eat with your lover. I would recommend this place of course, there's not much to talk about Sansotei because they have a few stores already, it's like a franchise. Recommended."}
{"text":"So I finally got to eat here today. (Woohoo) I have been wanting to eat here for quite some time now. Every time I went, it was either closed or there's a huge line up for it and lemme tell you, i ain't about that line up life LOL  but anyways i went around 2:30 pm to eat there so the line up by then has disappeared   alright so when i went in it was actually quite hot (don't think they turned on the ac) .. I don't really mind though cause today was relatively chilly. the restaurant isn't really too spacious and sometimes you might have sit close to people you don't know (their tables are like one long rectangle) When they gave my the menu...I was kind of surprised because it was so simple. I ordered the spicy tantan ramen (which is apparently limited daily according to the menu) and my mom got the tomato ramen.  overall, the ramen I got was pretty good! presentation wise, it was not the best.. but still good nonetheless [spicy broth with egg, bamboo shoots, pork belly, and this red stringy thing (don't know what it's called)] it was however pretty salty so after a few spoonful of ramen you would end up pretty thirsty   my mom also liked her tomato ramen (scallop, pork belly, bamboo shoots, shiitake, egg)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty average, not much flavoring in the soup and excessive MSG is what's popular these days."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype, I always see people lining up to get in. I admit that I don't have the sharpest taste but all my friends trust my food selection.   + 2 stars = Good ramen, well cooked and not too salty and bland depending on what you order +1 star = Well-designed place -1 star = Small portion, I can't never be full with one bowl. Need more meats! -1 star = No wow factor in the food"}
{"text":"I have never been too crazy about ramen but I would still eat it.  The problem I have with ramen is that it never fills me up and I have to eat at least two three bowls to actually feel full.   Why can't more ramen places offer those gigantic ramen bowls that kinton has once in a blue moon as eating challenge?   Please do not suggest to go there for dinner as I will veto the choice! I remember someone suggested we go there for dinner one time as a group as the place was very nearby. After dining there and also ordering extra apps, the whole group said it was still hungry and had to eat snacks and have drinks non stop. Go figure!    This location is so close to where I am. It really has ample parking though it isn't sometimes easy to get around with so much traffic in the plaza. Restaurant has a lot of long tables. There seems to be always a line but the line is never too long of a wait  as food comes fast and prompt. Btw the resto will quickly give u a bill once u done. Not a place to sit and chat. I would go there more often if ramen could fill me up and isn't like snack and could be passable for lunch lol    What about the broth? I actually like it. The flower really adds presentation to the ramen and u can actually eat the flower!!  Nothing against this place but no hurry to go back may time soon.  Edit: I find it funny that someone 'took' the time to single handily mention me in their review when I don't see them calling other people for the same exact opinion? Now look who is the one being childish and unprofessional here? My opinion still stands and I am not the only one who will bring up the small portions of food being offer when dining out in their reviews - cheers stay tuned for more reviews by me :)"}
{"text":"First of all, decoration is fantastic, all the furniture is in bamboo and made to perfect cut. However, the food is the let down, i ordered a tonkotsu ramen, it was very salty and also their char siu is still cold inside, they did not torch it enough and only one side get torched. They also marinate the meat in the cinamon wine and make it too strong of the smell. Just curious, why would the marinate Japanese char siu in cinamon wine? Maybe it is adjusted to the Chinese taste."}
{"text":"Delicious broth and thick, chewy noodles. I got the garlic oil broth and the only thing was that the texture was kind of grainy. But otherwise delicious! Didn't really like the karage tho."}
{"text":"Yummm!! Even when it's almost closing time, there's a line. This place was worth lining up for. The ramen was delicious! They let you pick the type of noodle and the type of broth. The broth was flavorful and rich. The atmosphere definitely made you feel as if you were in Japan since the place is small and everyone is so nice. I also tried the gyoza which was really good!"}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner on Saturday around 5pm. I was surprised to see that the place was already quite packed. We got seated right away in a booth that could probably sit up to 8. This booth was shared though.  We sat on one side of the booth while 2 other customers sat on the other side. Sharing was no big deal though. I didn't mind since there was enough room between us so that I didn't feel like they would be eavesdropping in our conversation the entire time.   The waiters here were friendly and attentive. They came over quickly to take our order and got us water as soon as we placed our order. I noticed that they kept walking around checking the other tables and made sure everybody's water was filled.   I ordered the tomato ramen with thick noodles. It was delicious. The noodles themselves were good and I thought the egg was cooked perfectly and the pork belly was so good that next time I'll probably order extra. I do admit that the soup for the noodles were a bit salty but it was salty deliciousness!   One thing that I didn't really like was how I felt rushed to leave as soon as I was finished. As soon as the waiter notices that you're finished your meal they come and take away your bowls and bring you the bill. I guess this is how they ensure a fast turnover.   I would definitely come back again to try their other noodles."}
{"text":"The ramen was very good and the price is very decent for the quality of the food, but the reason for the relatively low rating is the abysmal service.  The waitresses kept trying to push us out of the restaurant! I understand that there's a line for people to be seated, but refusing to re-fill our glasses of water and shoving us the bill isn't appreciated. The line wasn't even that long! There were literally 5 people (2 different tables) waiting to be seated.  Not only that, but they gave us the wrong change after we paid for our meal. That, in my opinion, is absolutely unacceptable. Asian jokes regarding math skills aside, no restaurant should ever make that mistake.  Great food, cool decor, decent prices, bad service. Still, the ramen was pretty damn good. Try the Tonkotsu!"}
{"text":"Amazing ramen. Came here on a Saturday at 5:30 and the place was busy ie. about a 20 minute wait for 2 people. The unfortunate thing is that the place is so small everyone has to wait outside (it was -20 degrees that night). However, the wait was worth it, as the ramen was perfect.   Ordered the tonkutsu black, as it was recommended by a friend. Would order again. It was very filling.   Total bill with a hot tea was about $15 + tip.  Highly recommended, but be prepared to wait if coming during peak hours."}
{"text":"Saw all the great reviews and thought I should definitely try it out. I walked up with my friend and walked in to a busy space and was basically told to get out and go outside.   I was floored, she then said go line up outside!  I was unaware that there was a line up outside seeing as there is another busy establishment next door as well.   I think the place does well seeing as it's that busy, it's too bad they don't have customer service skills to match the great food reviews....."}
{"text":"Been to many ramen places, this one did not make it on my list. Ordered ramen with garlic oil, miso ramen, and their green tea cheese cake. Both ramen were ordered with thick noodles. Noodles were undercooked so it was hard and stiff. Egg was also under cooked, soft but egg yolk was still too raw; yolk was leaking everywhere into the broth. Miso ramen broth was so salty I ended up drinking 2-3 cups of water. Green tea cheesecake needs more green tea taste. It's a small little restaurant with waiting line, but you have to wait outside."}
{"text":"Went here two times with no wait in line (luckily). I don't mind waiting 5 minutes or so, but any longer I wouldn't want to eat here. I really like the texture of the noodles here! Super fast service and portions are satisfying enough to fill you up. I do find the broths here to be more on the salty side, but nonetheless, rich and tasty. If you're unsure what to order - tonkatsu is the way to go. I've also tried the tomato which wasn't too bad either. If you're near Eaton center and craving noodles, this place is where you should go."}
{"text":"I only been once so will have to visit one more time to give full review but so far this place isn't bad. Though they could use better noodle than just dried noodle. Also I think they used bit too much msg (had a bad headache after).  Cute and clean interior, perfect location, not bad ramen, but it wasn't worth of long line up.  I would visit again if there is no line up."}
{"text":"One of JC favorite places when it comes to go-to Ramen.  Located at Birchmount and Hwy 7 plaza right by Panera Bread, this restaurant is serving some traditional Japanese ramen soup options. With a warm, simple, clean, yet bustling ambiance they've got a great selection focusing on quality ingredients and added sides.  Taking the bar seats we were able to bypass the line as most chose to wait for tables/ booths...SCORE!  Their prices are reasonable and portions are fulfilling as Ramens ranged between $10-13, not bad. For drinks we had their house Sake: Eiko Fuji Ban Ryu $10 for a 4 ounce which was reasonable and delish. Tonkotsu black ramen was our choice and were we satisfied, presentation and portion was bang on, delish mushroom broth was comforting. Overall great place! Service 5/5 Cleanliness 4/5 Food 4.5/5 Ambiance 5/5"}
{"text":"This place is super small man. Luckily I waited outside the day it wasn't too cold. The wait staff there I could hardly understand their english. Don't expect to ask too many questions.  But what we come for here is the Ramen. While waiting I can see their thin noodles are new, but recommended with the Tonkatsu ramen. I opted not to go with the new ones. Went with original. I don't think the noodles are as good as Kinton.  The broth, it was super pork flavor. If you like pork, you'll like this. If not, you may want to see what other broth they might have.  The \"zangi\", fried chicken was really nice. But way too little.  The eggs in the ramen, really nice. It was two open face eggs soft boiled. You could see the yolk just a bit cooked but for most part drippy. Very nicely done.  I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Hits the mark on a blustery day  Picked the right day for a hot bowl of ramen soup - winter is coming to Toronto! The tonkatsu ramen looked just like all the pictures on this site. - Eggs poached perfectly (yolk is still moist) - Pork belly - tasty, proper seasoning (not too salty) - Noodles - thin style ramen (al dente) - Broth - best for last: flavorful without MSG (I am allergic to that stuff); minimal oils; cloudy soup.  I slurped the noodles like one of the Extras in the classic Tampopo movie.  Yes. This place is genuine.   Lunch time soup is great. I will have to try dinner to see if quality is affected (based upon the inconsistent reviews)."}
{"text":"This location is close to me and it's never disappointed.  I've been here again and again and their noodles are perfect (I get double noodles).   Their tonkosu broth is great and not too salty and the black garlic version is great too!  There spicy tan tan soup ramen is good and but not super spicy."}
{"text":"The ramen scene has gotten intense in Mississauga! With Kinton opening up just last week and Sansotei having a soft opening till July. The service was great and the food came out relatively quick.  I ordered the Miso Black and Black Tonkatsu and was amazed how great it tasted, it tastes better than the YNF location and is as good as the yonge/dundas location. The noodles were perfect and i cant wait to go again. They dont have the $1 Sapporo deal but hopefully theyll promote it during their grand opening.  I cant wait to go again! This def tops all the other ramen places in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Another ramen review from the ramen snob.  Ordered: Tonkotsu, thin noodles Noodles: VERY good, cooked perfectly. Broth: Quite good, very creamy. However, I found that the broth lacked a depth of flavor and had a slight peppery taste that I wasn't fond of. Chashu: I really liked the flavor of this! I don't know how to describe it exactly, maybe an \"aged\" flavor? Whatever the flavor was, it was a delicious, unique, melt-in-your-mouth slice of heaven. Egg: VERY good, perfectly cooked with a runny yolk and nice flavoring.  Overall, I thought this was great ramen. Not the best I've ever had, but the chashu definitely made it memorable."}
{"text":"The ramen is SO GOOD. I think what makes it so unique is their broth! I tried the miso black and it was the most flavourful and rich miso ramen I've ever had. All the toppings that came with the ramen were also really flavourful and you can tell they were all cooked separately. The only bad thing is the long lines (we came around 1pm and there were about 6 people in front of us), but it just means the ramen is worth it! Even though there are lines, it goes by pretty fast as most people don't take that long eating. After ordering, the ramen also comes super quickly so the wait really wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and had high expectations.  The place is small and the seats are so close to each other. The food was below average.  I ordered the thick noodles and the inside was not fully cooked."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the hype about this place - line-ups outside and people giving good reviews.   I have eaten twice here just to confirm what I felt the first time I came to this place and that's  ... THIS IS NOT THE BEST RAMEN IN TORONTO!   But if there's one thing that irks me the most about this restaurant,  it's the tiny place.   You will be eating side by side with a total stranger or even facing someone you don't know.  I had the bad luck of being seated beside a couple. The girl wouldn't stop babbling and lecturing his husband about how many calories there is in a Tonkotsu Black due to the floating garlic oil or how many carbs in a ramen. For heaven's sake, don't you know you're eating in a ramen restaurant, of course there's going to be carbs/calories in there!    On a good side, the servers are nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Rich flavour from their tonkatsu black ramen thanks to their roasted garlic oil that is added on top of their regular tonkatsu ramen. This has been my first stop when I come to Toronto to visit the last couple of times and it never fails to disappoint."}
{"text":"Came here hungry for some ramen which I haven't had in a while.  The spicy tan tan sold out before 9pm, about an hour towards their closing time.  Ordered the regular tonkotsu ramen with thick noodles and extra chashu. The noodles and broth were ok... Disappointingly, the chashu was not so great at all. Although chashu was chunky, it was overcooked, lacked taste, and just didn't feel right. It was definitely not the melt-in-your-mouth pork belly. Sorry, that was a fail.  My friends didn't enjoy their tonkotsu black either. One of them had their noodles served tangled up (in a knot) and was hard to eat... It was weird. I guess we all prefer the downtown location... not sure if timing made a difference to their quality? Probably won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"by far my favourite tonkatsu ramen in the city, always satisfied, i usually get the tonkatsu black (with garlic oil). we probably come on average 3x a month. the soup is slightly salty but i don't leave feeling as if i consumed pure MSG. don't expect exceptional service here, it's a very much: sit, order, eat and, leave. waits are never too long, so i do appreciate how fast their service is."}
{"text":"Great ramen! Warm, salty broth. Plenty of noodles (you can pick thin or thick) and add ons (you MUST add an egg!).  Several bowl to choose from.   Limited seating, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"My good friend and I went to this restaurant for dinner recently.  The place is kind of small - so for those who want to go to a place that have loads of clear space and a table for themselves, this probably isn't the place. At the time my friend and I arrived, we had to share a table with the neighbouring patrons. Nothing really wrong with that though considering that the space of the restaurant is relatively small.   I decided to opt for their gyudon/beef bowl and gyoza instead of ordering ramen despite being in a ramen restaurant.   The beef itself was well seasoned and somewhat tender. I would say the texture is much like a decent stir fry - not too tough but not too tender. Its flavour has a good balance of umami and sweet. I can't really comment on the rice itself other than it works well with the beef. Kind of obvious but it's true. Despite it being a side dish, it's the perfect portion for a short person like me.   The gyoza themselves had a crispy yet chewy exterior with mouth watering filling comprised of pork, cabbage, and green onions (I could be wrong with that though so feel free to correct me). The sauce that was provided was subtly tart which complements the savouriness of the filling. I believe it's a combination of soy sauce and vinegar. Don't knock it 'til you try it! It really does add a little something to the gyoza.  What I am more impressed is with the SUPER prompt and friendly service. Just a few minutes in and BAM, there's the food. Yet, the quality and presentation of the food are not compromised by any means. Although the server has forgotten my gyoza order, they were quick to rectify this and quite frankly, I don't mind the wait one bit since the food's good and the servers are understanding.   If I come back to this place, I'll try out their other dishes - especially their ramen as my friend raved about them."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try out Sansotei since it opened up so close to me but was really disappointed by the experience.   When we arrived there were two empty tables (each seated for two) but we were told to wait. A few minutes in, I asked if we would be able to take one of the available tables but was once again told to wait. We waited for about 5-10min and then were finally seated at the empty table even though no one else was in line the whole time.   The waitress was super friendly and upon ordering, the food came really quickly. I ordered the tomato ramen with the jumbo shrimp. Once again, super excited but upon biting into the shrimp it was cold, fishy tasting and still raw. I talked to the waitress and I was asked to take out the shrimp and put it into a bowl to show the chef. She came back with another shrimp but at that point I didn't feel like eating it anymore. I was kind of expecting an apology, discount, or an acknowledgement of the experience but I left disappointed."}
{"text":"Sansotei is much quieter and intimate than most other ramen places in town. Walking in you are not greeted with drumrolls and a screaming chorus of \"Aligadoahhhhhhhh!!!!\" It's clean and minimalist, but cramped. And if you come early enough, you may find no lineup or a very short and quick one.  The soup is amazingly rich and creamy. And the yolky eggs, pork belly slices and bamboo shoots were all a well-cooked soft joy. Which is crazy to me that bamboo shoots can actually be edible since most other places the shoots are hard to bite on. You can choose the type of noodle--thin, thick or original. Their thick ramen were a great chewy chew. If you're running on an emptier stomach, order with extra noodles. In fact, ordering with extra noodles is the only way to go for me.  The folks here are polite, and will acknowledge the fact they get a lot of flack for not opening on Sunday. Their bowls hit the spot just right. Much better than Santouka further east. That's all folks.  {TTC: the 505-er to Chestnut St.}"}
{"text":"This restaurant is highly recommended by so many people so I arranged a visit there with expectation. And I should admit that both the ramen and soup are great with the heavy, intense, creamy taste. But for myself, the soup is so heavy that I can't finish all of them.   I'll mark this restaurant as \"should have a try for the first time but maybe not for the second time\"."}
{"text":"This is what I call real ramen..where the Tonkotsu is yummilicious..the noodles texture is close to perfection (in my standards)..  There's always a lineup..never been there without a lineup but its ok..it goes pretty quickly...within 15 mins..and you will get a table...  Theres less than 20 items on the menu so you can't possibly take forever to think about what to eat..Tonkotsu, Miso and etcc...  I always go with Tonkotsu because the broth is milky and flavourful...half boiled egg is good and the Cha Su (jap style) is equal in the fat and equal in the meat so its so yummy...green onions, black fungus...  Ordered. Service was good and attentive."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto, stopped by this ramen place.  Ramen noodles: It was okay, not as bouncy as I would normally prefer but still pretty good  Broth was very flavorful and delicious, could really taste that strong richness from the pork. Left my mouth watering afterwards for more, just wish I could change out the noodles. The black garlic oil is definitely delicious but if your interested in it than probably ask if they can put it on the side, if your worried it would overpower the whole ramen.   The half boiled egg was so delicious, yolk was perfectly cooked and still a little runny.  Tried the fried chicken, so good!!! Definitely nicely fried and the chicken was still so juicy!"}
{"text":"1st class ramen finally comes to Markham! And it's about damn time!  Having been to the original location all the way downtown once or twice, I was very surprise to see this shop pop up here in this relative new plaza.  Next to Whole Foods, Five Guys and the Forest Brooke Dental, I now have another reason to frequent this area.  (Word is too that York U is building a plaza down the street where the movie theatre is.)  Anyway, waited in line for 20-30 minutes - which is a given seeing as how popular this place normally is downtown already.  The line moved pretty quick, it was a beautiful warm evening so it wasn't bad waiting outside. But come winter, not sure if waiting outside will be a good thing if Sansotei continues to be popular.  The place is big, fresh new interiors with wooden tables, and strung rope on the ceiling reminiscent of ramen noodles.  This place is definitely going to be good for small groups.  I had the spicy tan tan ramen, while the other two in our party had the shio ramen and the black tonkatsu ramen.  We also ordered the friend chicken appetizer.  Food arrived pretty quick after we sent in our order.  The spicy tan tan ramen broth was full of sweet and sour flavor with a kick at the end, reminded me of tom yum soup but in a pork broth.  It was also lightly creamy too - all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my spicy tan tan ramen.  It also came with a generous amount of pepper flakes, and two whole runny eggs sliced in half.  There was only one piece of pork belly.   The noodles were also cooked perfectly, al dente as expected of a ramen restaurant of this caliber.  I actually kept sipping on the soup after eating all of the noodles! (A decision I would regret the next morning, but more on that later.)  My fellow diners didn't have anything to complain either, in fact they finished before me!  As for the chicken appetizer, it was deep fried and came hot to order to our table.  It was juicy and definitely teased our appetites. Reminded me of Taiwanese style deep fried chicken.   My only gripe is they may have used too much MSG as I could still taste the ramen broth on the back of my tongue the next morning.  I also had a mild stomach ache, mainly due to the over abudance of chilly flakes in the spicy ramen.  I know not to order this the next time since with my old age, my iron stomach is not the way it used to be. Sadly.  I will be returning soon, because I am so glad to have a decent ramen joint so close to home!  Sansotei - I think will blow the other so called ramen restaurants in Markham out of the water!"}
{"text":"We got there around a little bit later than dinner time and there was still a long line-up. We were starving and started considering going to another restaurant because the line was barely moving... Luckily, we ended up staying in that line because their ramen turned out to be one of my favorites!   The restaurant was surprisingly small, which explains the lineup. I thought it would be bigger but I got tricked by the mirror that gave the illusion of a wider space. We got seated in front of the window since that was the only seats available at that time (or else we need to wait longer for tables to clear). The staff did ask us if we mind, but we were too hungry to mind. Thus, we ended up facing all the people who were in line with us; it was a bit weird and awkward. I didn't like that experience since I don't like it when people are looking/staring at me while I'm eating. It put a bit of pressure on me as I know they are hungry and craving for that ramen, so I got to eat faster -FYI, I'm a slow eater.  We both already know what we wanted to order, so when the waitress brought us water, we ordered with her right away. We ordered their Tonkotsu ramen, Tonkotsu Black ramen, Zangi and Calpico drinks. We originally wanted to try their Spicy Slow Cooked Wings but they sold out on it already, so we order their fried chicken instead.  You can pick the thickness of your noodles, I usually go with thin but now I realized, thick noodles are a lot chewier (so I'll opt for thick one in the future)!  The Tonkotsu ramen is their signature dish, and I usually like to go with their classics on my first visit. It was also recommended by their online menu to pick thin noodles for \"the most authentic and delicious experience\". My friend recommended me their Black Tonkotsu but I didn't want to order the same thing as him (since I wouldn't be able to taste 2 different ramen). My ramen came with 2 pieces of char-siu (pork belly), a soft-boiled egg, black fungus and green onion.The noodles were first firm but quickly became too soft/soggy to my liking. The char-siu, which were flavorful and tender, reminded me those from Misoya but minus the torched part. The broth was creamy but not too thick or salty. And finally the soft-boiled was perfectly made (runny yolk and soft) but I think Kinton have better soft-boiled egg (more marinated). If only I can get the broth from Sansotei, the char-siu from Misoya and the soft-boiled egg from Kinton, it would be one of the best ramens ever!  The Black Tonkotsu ramen is like their original Tonkotsu but with roasted garlic oil. However, this roasted garlic oil changed the ramen and made it taste even better! It was more flavorful and I definitely like it better! My friend got their thick noodles and I also think ramen with thick noodles taste better! Next time, I would order this instead of their classic Tonkotsu ramen or try their Miso Black.  Their Zangi (Chicken karaage, Hokkaido style) was the juiciest fried chicken I've ever had. The meat was firm but still tender, and well-seasoned. There wasn't a layer of fat in between too (some places' karaage have that, and it is disgusting). Would definitely order this again.  Their Calpico wasn't good, you can totally avoid this!"}
{"text":"It's probably the most authentic ramen you'll get in downtown Ottawa. That being said, it matches the flavor profile of what you would get in Toronto or elsewhere. A solid lunch or dinner option!"}
{"text":"After coming here many many times repeatedly and ordering the same thing, it is time for a review. If you come here around lunch time, expect a line. Because the restaurant on Dundas West is so small, they line people up outside of the restaurant. In the heart of winter, please dress warmly, as you will have to wait outside.  I've came  here many times over the past three years. The orders I usually get consist of the TOMATO ramen ($10.75), the zangi fried chicken (~$4.25)  and a glass of calpico (~$3).  Since I frequent ramen places quite often, I can't say I have seen the Tomato ramen on any other ramen menus other than Sansotei.  In a thick tomato broth, it is served with one slice of pork belly, a whole tomato, a scallop and a soft boiled egg neatly chopped in half. The tomato soup is not like an Italian tomato soup, but a soup base with clear Japanese influences. It is difficult to explain, but maybe it is the Tonkotsu flavours as well. I always finish the soup in the bowl because it is just that good even after the noodles. You can order the noodles thick or thin - both are cooked right (not al dente, but not mushy) , so it is really a matter of your personal tastes.  The zangi fried chicken is perfect to share. It is always fried to perfection served with a few slices of lemon. Not too oily, not too dry!  Lastly for the calpico, it is cheaper than T&T stores. If you are craving sugar and the awesome yogurty drink that is often quite pricey in supermarkets, might as well order one at the restaurant. It comes in a glass (not in a bottle or a can like you would find in stores)."}
{"text":"Tastes pretty good, but the price-to-portion ratio is poor.  Definitely get the extra noodles (and maybe even 2x extra noodles if they allow that) unless you're not hungry."}
{"text":"Oh man. I'm from Los Angeles where we have a bunch of great and legit ramen houses from Japan, but this place ranks highly in my list of ramen shops. It's rare to find a ramen shop that doesn't apologize for their style of ramen, and deliveries it confidently and executes on it. I drop by every time I am in town.   The egg is done just right, the charsu is of high quality, the thick noddle is chewy, and the broth is unreasonably flavorful  and delicious. I usually don't enjoy a lot of garlic, but black ramen is the way to go! Just stop reading and go get a bowl now!"}
{"text":"My favourite ramen place. Been here many times, usually always get the same order (Spicy Tan Tan). Great service, awesome food, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It was a nice hot day. We came here on Saturday for dinner and the outdoor temperature was 34c-39c ish and there was no AC in the restaurant. The staffs said AC was on but for some reason its not working...it was freaking hot in the restaurant. It was definitely not a good experience eating hot ramen in a high 25c environment.   I ordered spicy tantan, it wasnt that spicy. You have a choice of thin or thick noodles. I got thick and my friend got thin. In my opinion, there is no difference they both looked the same to me.   The soup base was okay 3.5/5 Noodles was meh 3/5 I personally prefer Kenzo's noodles they are more chewy.  There was one piece of pork- one piece- so so 3.5/5 Overall 3/5 for this bowl of ramen.   And their pricing is on a higher side.  This place is relatively small. I dont think I will come back. I have not tried Kinton Ramen in sauga. However, between here and Kenzo I would prefer Kenzo and will not come back."}
{"text":"So my and my cousin are super huge fans of noodles.  I don't know what it is about noodle soup that's so comforting.  In any case, we had the fried chicken appetizer.  Yummy.  And i ordered the tonkatsu ramen (skiny noodles), and my cousin ordered the miso with fat noodles.    I didn't see a big difference between the fat noodles and the skinny noodles, so I think choosing either for your soup is probably ok.  Yummy!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ramen is my absolute favorite meal. Sansotei is one of the spots that I would go to often to get my fix. Their menu is limited but it definitely makes it easier to choose what to eat.  Review about ramen: I normally get the tonkatsu ramen with an extra egg. Their tonkatsu broth is creamy, like most tonkatsu however their pork flavor is stronger than others. Their chasui is on the stiffer side but still has a lot of flavor. Also their eggs are perfectly soft boiled. A recommendation that I would make is to get thicker noodle than thin. The reason is thicker noodles are able to grasp on to the broth better.   Review about appetizers: Spicy slow cooked wings: one of Sansotei's best sellers and I can definitely understand why. The meat is very tender, falling off the bone easily. It has a strong aroma of spices, creating a deep flavor profile.   Zangi: this dish is also known as chicken karrage aka fried chicken. A great sharing buffer if you are eating friends, however I wouldn't rave about it. The taste is great however there is no wow factor to this dish.   Price: Ramen dishes: approx. $9 before taxes  Zangi: $4.50 Slow cooked wings: $6.00  Pros: - Service is amazing as food comes out rather quickly.  - There's a lot of parking compared to the other two locations. It is in a plaza complex, so you never really need to worry.   Cons: - This location in particular has a long wait time during the weekend starting from 6pm so you may need to make reservations before hand"}
{"text":"Best Ramen in Toronto for sure--- for now. There is almost always a line up outside this place. A while back, my friends and I waited almost two hours in the cold to eat here. Yes, it sounds stupid but it was worth it.  The soup is super rich and full of flavour without being excessively oily. The ramen here is definitely comparable to ramen in Tokyo.  I usually never drink all of the soup from noodles, but here I order extra noodles (only $1 extra!) just to soak it all up.   Tonkatsu ramen with thick noodles is my go-to choice!   If you want good ramen in Toronto, I highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Tonkatsu Ramen with thick noodles is so good.  Quality seems to be the same as the downtown location, but the line up system is terrible here. I don't think they know how to control their crowd yet.   We actually waited outside for 10 mins before they opened. By the time we were seated, there was already a sea of people waiting inside the restaurant, crowding the door, and watching us eat. It seems like a huge fire hazard as we had to push through a whole bunch of people in order to get out.   We really wanted to order more than just ramen after we finished our bowls, but 40 mins within opening they already seemed super stressed, annoyed, and wanted everyone to leave, so we did that.  Not sure when the hype of this location will die down, if ever, but until it does I think I would just stick with the downtown location."}
{"text":"I ate the spicy ramen last week, i think the taste was so so, I can't find anything special about it. For me it's kinda plain, definitely it needs a little bit flavour. Overall it's not worth paying $15 for a this ramen."}
{"text":"I don't know why I havent written a review yet. This is my goto ramen spot. I live near aji, kenzo, kinton and menami in north york but I drive all the way downtown (& pay for parking) just to get that delicious Black tonkatsu bowl. Thick or thin noodles I still debate with myself every time I eat here and please dnt forget to order yourself an order of that zangi chicken :)"}
{"text":"Easily the best Ramen in the city! I ordered the Tonkotsu black and was blown away by my first taste of delicious broth. I avoid wheat in my diet and was easily able to get my order without noodles. Great price too, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Small menu, quick service, almost necessary to get extra noodles so it lasts longer."}
{"text":"Wonderfully surprised! Great ramen with wonderful flavour! Was supposed to go somewhere else but parked right in front and gave it a try. Glad we did!"}
{"text":"Got the original tonkotsu.  the thick noodles hard a great texture and the soft boiled egg was perfect, except it was cold. the bamboo was i think marinated in some sauce which i wasnt fond of. The soup was milder compared to other places, but not creamier. The pork was very firm, like it was overcooked, and i dislike their large spoons and shared tables. I'd only go back if i was very hungry and there was no line."}
{"text":"Sansotei is my favorite ramen place in Toronto. Some may argue that they like the noodles more at other places. But I think Sansotei makes the most flavorful tonkotsu broth and broth is crucial in a bowl of ramen.   I have always liked Sansotei for their ramen. My favorite is the tonkotsu black. The tonkotsu black is stronger than the regular tonkotsu with the extra garlic oil. The broth isn't thick but it is so flavorful. Spicy tantan is also good for those spicy lovers.    I like both types of noodles. The thick is more chewy while the thin absorbs more of the broth flavor. I like to switch it up from time to time.   The service here is good. Water is replenished often and the waiters are welcoming."}
{"text":"Loved it! Came here at 9pm on a Saturday night with a 10 minute wait. This place is a bit small and no space to wait inside so you may see a line forming outside!  The food came out pretty fast, we ordered the Zangi, Tonkatsu black and Miso Black with thin noodles. Everything was so good and full of flavor. I would say this is one of my favorite ramen places of all time!! Next time I'm back in Toronto, I'm making sure to come back here."}
{"text":"Expectations met! Not too salty compared to other ramen places. Will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this restaurant many times since they open. Not ever have I've been disappointed. Their services are always excellent and the quality of the remans are great !  I am always a happy and satisfied customer with a full belly leaving this restaurant!!  I will be back!!!!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and it was totally worth the 10-15 minute or so wait to get a table. I had ordered the Tonkotsu black and was blown away by how delicious the roasted garlic oil was. The garlic oil added an amazing depth of flavor to this bowl of ramen.The pork was tender albeit kind of a pain in the ass to separate into multiple pieces.  It was not the absolute best bowl of ramen I have ever had but it was definitely worth the stop in to try it. My only regret was that I didn't order extra noodles. I just tend to like a little bit more then is usually served."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????3??"}
{"text":"Waited for 20-30 mins before our ramen came and noodle wasnt the best, the pork was super fat!!! But we were hungry hope they serve better food in the future. Lack management on staff! Also dish cleaner must be broken cause I saw a lot of bubbles when I got my bowl."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how much I enjoyed my visit. Everyone was welcoming and very friendly. I eat a good bit of Pho and love it! I've never had ramen. The lady who waited on me was very helpful. Oh so delicious! Pork with garlic oil. Before I leave tomorrow, I might just skip breakfast and try the spicy pork ramen."}
{"text":"Maybe I haven't had the \"real\" ramen experience living in the suburbs, but this was quite the treat. Atmosphere is great, tight tables and nice lighting. Service is quick and helpful (answered my clueless questions about the different types of ramen).   I ordered Shio Ramen, and my friend got Shoyo ramen. Meat was very tender, runny boiled egg was a great touch, and the broth itself was delicious. Total came to just under $12 w/ tax and tip, so no complaints there. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This ramen is addictive. I love their tomato ramen and basic tonkotsu ramen. One of the best ramen places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Noodles ok, got the tonkatsu with thick noodles. Very similar to thin, chewy texture. Eggs perfectly cooked, and pork belly better than expected. Not enough noodles though and kinda salty."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan!   Working nearby, I would always see the huge lineup around lunch and dinner time. I left work early to catch up with a high school friend who was also working in the area. I ordered the Tonkonkyu ramen (sorry for misspelling and/or wrong name!) and my friend got the Shio. The meat was super tender and I am in love with the egg at these japanese ramen places. The staff are super friendly and great you with loud voices whenever you enter and leave :) The restaurant is actually very small but the service is quick. I think us approx. 15min from entering to leaving but felt we definitely got our money's worth! Once again, definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Came a few days ago with a friend. We were greeted by two waitresses upon entering. There were a few seats available so we were seated right away. Both of us ordered the Tonkotsu Black. The food was brought to us within 10-15 minutes of ordering.   The broth was tasty and the noodles were cooked just right. Although it was good, there was nothing remarkable about the overall flavours.  Overall, good ramen and prompt, friendly service. My rating would be closer to 4.5 stars if that were an option."}
{"text":"Best overall ramen in toronto but I believe kinton has better quality meat"}
{"text":"Every time I went to eaton center passing by the restaurant, there are always many people waiting outside! I felt so curious and decided to try it asap! But I think the waiting scenery was just because the space inside was not enough.. The ramen actually was not that tasty.  I went there at Monday afternoon with a friend. We ordered a seaweed salad,a Tonkatsu ramen and  a black one which add black garlic oil making the dish more delicious. The thickness of the noodle can be chosen by yourself but actually not very different. The soup was a little salty and vegetables were too less. The seaweed salad was great but I can buy a party size of it with same price .  The atmosphere was not bad for meal and I dislike the spoon.. It needs a try but only once. There are many ramen with better flavor in Toronto I think."}
{"text":"I get most of my ramen at Sansotei and I'm never disappointed. Of all the franchises I like them the most for having great consistency. Appetizers like gyoza are just okay, so I usually skip them. I recommend trying the thick noodles, and the black tonkatsu (pork with garlic oil). It's rich and delicious and same flavours every time."}
{"text":"Having tried some of the best ramen in the world during my recent visit to the birthplace of ramen (Japan), I can firmly say this place can keep up with the boys of Japan. Dare I say....the best ramen in the great TDOT? Absolutely! Best in the world? No...not quite but a worthy mention among the elites for sure.  First and foremost, the broth is rich, porky and oozing with umami but maybe a little on the salty side. The chasu is tender and melt in your mouth delicious. The noodles on the other hand are a bit disappointing; slightly overcooked (despite my request for firmer noodles during all my visits) and really lacking that distinctive \"chew\" that great ramen's have. Probably because they buy their noodles from somewhere (or so I heard). The egg is cooked as close to perfection as it can be but it can be better as it dawned upon me during my visit to Japan.  This is as good as ramen gets in town but you will have to patient. The lineups are ridiculous unless you visit during really odd times."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the Tonkotsu Black with extra egg and pork belly (which is a great idea!) and I ordered the Shio. At 8:30pm on a Tuesday evening, they had run out of the Spicy Tantan. We will have to try that next time. I tend to like a lighter broth and really enjoyed the Shio Ramen. The flavor was complex and delicious. I ordered it with thick noodles which I now know I prefer to thin noodles. The tonkotsu black had a very rich flavor as well and I didn't feel that the garlic oil flavor was too strong. I will say that this restaurant gets warm - this is great on a winter day but a little much on a hot summer day. The beers ($6.50 sapporo and $7.00 asahi black) are cold and refreshing though and will cool you off if you need it! It's a small place and though we managed to squeeze in without a wait, I would expect a wait if you're going during peak dinner time."}
{"text":"Service was good, prices were good, however food not really up to par.  Egg was cold in the middle, Garnishes lacking on soup, Pork was dry (Why do they pan fry it?) and the broth had a kind of burnt essence to it."}
{"text":"Menu: http://www.sansotei.com/  What we had: tonkotsu black ramen (tried both thick and thin noodles), spicy tantan ramen (thin noodle), tomato ramen (thin noodle), spicy slow cooked wings, green tea cheesecake (We had this over multiple visits. We don't eat THAT much.)  Taste: 9/10  Their broth is thick and flavourful and the ramen is chewy. Out of the ones we've tried (tonkotsu black, tomato, spicy tantan), they've all been pretty good. We prefer the thin noodle over the thick noodle. One of the best parts about their bowls is the the egg. The egg white is cooked but tender, and the yolk is runny. It's so good (would recommend the extra egg option for $1.50).   The slow cooked wings were not so impressive. They tasted like they were cooked for a little too long and the meat was getting old. Would not get those again.  We always finish our meal with a green tea cheesecake. Their cheesecake is light but flavourful. Next time we will try the tofu cheesecake.  Value: 7/10  4-6$ for the appetizers, 9-10$ for the ramen (you can include extra meat, eggs, veges etc. for 1-2$ per item).  4$ for the cheesecake.  **Average cost per diner: 16$ After Tax+Tip  Service/Convenience: 7/10  The place is fairly easy to locate, though they don't have a large sign saying \"Sansotei\" or anything. You'll most likely recognize the store by the line of people waiting outside. Due to the limited space inside the restaurant, they make patrons wait outside even during winter. Sometimes the wait could be more than 30 minutes (we never wait that long but we've seen really long lines of more than 10 people). Once you're in, they are very polite and efficient. However, due to language barriers, they sometimes mix up your order or has trouble with bill splitting.  Would go back? Yes, their savoury ramen soup is great for warming up in the winter.   Would recommend to friend? Yes, if they like soup noodles.  Similar places: Hokkaido Ramen Santouka, and probably any other ramen store but we've only been to Sansotei and Santouka  **Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza (16\") in one sitting."}
{"text":"Ramen cravings are much easier to satisfy now that Sansotei opened in downtown Markham. I really enjoy the Tonkotsu black ramen with thin noodles and the Tomato Scallop ramen.  The place is always busy, but I find that the service is still very good."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, cheap! Isn't that all that Ramen is supposed to be? This place nails those three points really well, with very friendly service on top."}
{"text":"When I came here for the first time, I was able to try their miso ramen which is my go-to ramen. It's disappointing that they discontinued it since it was pretty good. The soup base wasn't overly rich and half cooked egg was amazing. The service was great and luckily I went before it got super busy. The only downside is that it does get a bit cramped because it is a pretty small restaurant. [4.5/5]"}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 3 for an early dinner.  I was actually surprised to see lines build up for a restaurant in uptown - I rarely see that happen (except for bubble tea shops!). Service was excellent - we had 3 different waitresses serve us and all of them were great.  GYOZA (3/5)  SPICY SLOW COOKED CHICKEN WINGS (4/5) I liked this one but the portions were small.  TOKOTSU BLACK (2.5/5) (pork belly, black fungus, egg, green onion, garlic, oil) I thought the soup base was too salty. The thin noodles, pork belly and other ingredients within the ramen was okay but the more I ate the ramen, the more salty everything became lol. I'll probably order just the TONKOTSU soup base next time.."}
{"text":"The service was good - lots of smiles from our server's face. I came at 5:30 and it wasn't too busy yet. The line up did grow as it reached 6/6:30 though. Maybe a 30 min wait?  The broth was quite tasty and not too greasy. I didn't feel thirsty after either which was a good sign. The meat was good too (and fatty which made it even better...or worse depending on your perspective). I would've liked more toppings (veggies and meat) and didn't care much for the chinese fungus.  I wasn't a fan of the noodles but my friends liked it. It's not the same ramen noodles that I've had at other places and it tasted a bit pastier."}
{"text":"It was -2 degrees outside and we had to be in the elements to wait for seating which was a little annoying. It was only for 10 min and it was worth the slight frostbite.  We had Ramon and the fried chicken and it was amazing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My oldest niece wanted Sansotei Ramen for her birthday lunch! The restaurant doesn't open till noon time. Went there around 11:50pm and already a couple of ppl waiting at the door. It was a very tiny place. Right at 12 they opened the door and let all the people in, at that time there was probably around 16 ppl at the door.   So for the lunch service it was only ramen, no side dishes at all. I decided to try their limited quantity Spicy Tantan Ramen.   The broth was quite rich and full flavour. I enjoyed the texture of the thick noodles. Wished there was another piece of meat, but it had small portion of grounded pork in the broth as well with soft boiled egg & seasoned bamboo shoots.   It looked like a plain bowl of noodles, but it was quite satisfying and delicious.   Service was excellent, waitress came by many time to refill our cups of tea. And was very polite and asked if she could take our empty bowls away.  Might come back to try evening service one day :D"}
{"text":"I thought this place was just another over rated ramen noodle house, but it was actually really good!! Tonkotsu black with thick ramen noodles is the best! The noodles are chewy and the soup is so good! Eggs are cooked perfectly!  I think the portion size was great for me but for a lot of guys out there, it's been recommended to get an extra bowl of the noodles. :)  Service is super quick but there's almost always a line up. We waited maybe 10-15 minutes. Ohh and drink lots of water!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here last time and it wasn't that great.  Maybe it was the hair on a glass or something else.  Anyways, we braved the cold for this place.  Not too bad on boxing day at dinner.    Broth is always good and the karaage (they call it something else) is good.  Don't get the Gyoza's.  It's a rip off.  My big complaint?  I saw someone next to us order a green tea muffin.  Ok I want to try new things.  Well...that new thing was expensive.  $4 for a small muffin that was ok in taste.  Service was meh on our way out, no good bye or thank you like everyone else got.  Resist the urge to get the green tea muffin.  Your wallet will thank me later."}
{"text":"Sansotei richmond hill.  Excellent ramen with an option of less salty. The soup was so yummy and it's less salty I drink it all. Yum yum yum. Beer is good too.  The ramen n beer combo is only $15. Very good price."}
{"text":"This is all you need to know: GO.  Here is what you need to plan:  1. Bring a jacket during the cold months.  There is no waiting inside. 2. Expect to wait and wait a while if you arrive during prime dining hours. 3. Don't expect a WIDE selection.  The menu is simple, very simple. 4. Expect to share a table with strangers.  What to expect from the food:  1. A.Mazing, CLEAN, flavor.  Not super salty and not too bland.   2. Fresh ingredients. 3. Go with Original Sansotei noodles. 4. Order extra meat, veggies and noddles; especially if you have a BIG appetite.  Like I said, simply GO!!!  That is all."}
{"text":"If you asked me if I wanted a steaming hot bowl of noodles after survivng the Yonge Street windtunnel, the answer would always be YES YES and... YES!   Definitely a small space and the seating can probably occupy up to 40 people at any given time. It is tucked away on Byng near ZenQ and hard to find if you're not an area local. Walk too quickly and you might miss it.  Came in on a Wednesday and there is a Monday-Wednesday $14 special with a Sapporo with any ramen on the menu.  So what does any human do naturally?  You order the most expensive ramen (Miso Black) on the menu to get your dollar's worth and when all your friends do the same, you hover over the one that's most aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The one with the better looking orchid-ish flower, the one with all the black miso neatly painted on one side.  And if you ask me why, it's because you still consider yourself instagram-relevant and your only existence in this world is to 'do it for the gram'"}
{"text":"I don't really see the hype in this place - every time I've come here the soup is lukewarm and over-salty. It's okay but definitely not the best ramen I've ever had (Ajisen Ramen ftw!). The meat is not plentiful in the ramen which is disappointing. I really do like the atmosphere of the place though - feels very Japanese style. Probably wouldn't come here again unless my friend begged me to."}
{"text":"Went around lunchtime and tried the standard tonkotsu ramen and was not disappointed. The noodles were cooked perfectly, there were the right amount of toppings and while I'm usually someone who doesn't finish their broth I couldn't help but finish the entire bowl.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice. It is fairly small but not overwhelmingly crowded despite every seat being in use. The service was also very fast and the waitresses were very attentive.  I'd love to go back and try some of their other ramen as well as the mango cheesecake."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy tantan and I thought it was tasty but thought that the portion size was a little small. I definitely wasn't full.  The soup was good and was hot when it first arrived but cooled down way too quickly. Maybe they need different bowls that retain the temperature better.  Tea also costs money which I wasn't a fan of.  It was ok but definitely not worth lining up for. I'll give it another shot in the future to see if I just caught them on a off day  Stay tuned for a follow up.   Recap. Not good enough to line up"}
{"text":"Great ramen, one of the top ramen restaurants in Toronto. Always consistent with their quality and their bowls come with different options. Not worth a long wait though, so I'd try going on off-peak hours and avoid the dinner/lunch rush hour."}
{"text":"They used to be ok, sub par to kinton. But now they have improved a lot, both in the quality of the noodle and the soup. I usually visit this more often because of the relatively short wait-time and more quite ambient noise."}
{"text":"Very delicious ramen! We went on a Sunday lunch and it wasn't busy at all. My fiancé ordered the spicy tan tan and I ordered the classic tonkosu, mine was delicious but I wish I had ordered the spicy tan tan, the soup was delicious. I ended up putting my noodles in his bowl and eating the spicy tan tan soup. Service was great, it was fast and friendly. I'd definitely come back. Only complaint is the parking, it's mostly street parking and we had to park pretty far."}
{"text":"This place....so damn good. While I still lived in San Francisco I used to go to Ramen Dojo religiously. And I have to say that I like this place much better than that. So let's preface this with I'm a ramen whore, I cook my own 12 hour broth at home, and I've been around to some well known places throughout Hawaii, Northern and Southern California. I'm no guru, but I've been around. My husband ordered the tonkatsu ramen with extra egg large noodles and I had the Tan Tan with extra egg small noodles (regular sized as opposed to thin). There was alittle bit of a mix up and my husband's order and they thought he ordered tan tan also (most likely a communication/hearing problem), but that was quickly fixed with absolutely no barriers. our waitress was swift and sweet about it.   Once we got our hands on our bowls I usually taste the broth first and boy was my mouth just slammed with so much complexity in flavor, yet the fattiness didn't stick all over my face as so many other places have, even Ramen Dojo. The charsiu was alright and not much to write about, but my egg was cooked perfectly. Many places I've been to recently either omit this or over do the egg. They don't have any extras on the table that you can put in your ramen like pepper, hot oil, or minced garlic, but it's because you don't greaking have to. I cannot praise this place enough for make my tongue dance so much. I literally was so full I couldn't eat anymore, but I wanted to continue sipping the broth to please my taste buds.   It's a small place from what I could see and no line when I went around 9pm Saturday night. Locals could give you a better sense of how busy it may get at what times. But it's a must when your going to Toronto!"}
{"text":"My favourite ramen in Toronto! I enjoy that this location does not have the \"authentic ramen shop\" vibe. For once I can enjoy my noodles without elbowing the person next to me. Very tasty ramen and karaage. Would return to chow down more of their delicious noodles but definitely wouldn't line up in -20 degree weather for it."}
{"text":"Always loved the rich soup base at Sansotei, brings me back to the ramen dinning experiences back in Japan. The servers are super friendly and you can actually understand what they are saying in English.   Took off stars because it doesn't matter how cold it is outside, even if it's just the 2 of you waiting, they make you wait outside. Every time the door is opened,  cold draft comes in. Can't enjoy a ramen without wearing a jacket. Other Japanese places would have placed a temporary stormdoors/porch to let customers wait and prevent the draft from entering."}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype about this place. It's small and crowded and the ramen (I ordered Tonkatsu Ramen) is served lukewarm and not hot. The flavour isn't anything mind blowing. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"After reading complaints about their thin noodles, I was pleasantly surprised with the ramen at Sansotei. I ordered the thick noodle Tonkotsu ramen and after the first taste of the soup, I was already impressed and thought it was good compared to just 'okay' experiences at Santouka and other ramen places.  Noodle - The thick noodle I ordered was firm with a nice springy bite which is how I prefer it.  Soup - slightly creamy and pretty salty, but I still enjoyed it (despite by low tolerance for salt). It was a great hot temperature as well and very addictive.  Egg - Softboiled to perfection; sweet almost-runny yolk, soft egg white with slight soy sauce taste - so delicate! Pork - my favorite out of Kinton (flavorful but slightly hard) and Santouka (thin and on the bland side). This was a good size and thickness, great balance of fat and tender meat, flavorful with slightly charred edges.  Sides - green onion really added some fresh taste to the salty soup and noodles. \"wood fungus\" was nicely cooked.   Tried some Shio broth - salty and more clear than the tonkotsu.   Overall, good bowl of ramen, +1 for the pork, and in a convenient location!"}
{"text":"I couldn't eat the ramen but my friends loved them.  I ate the salmon rice bowl and the pickled stuff.  Very good."}
{"text":"i've been here four times.  the first time i had a tonkotsu ramen. liked it.  the second time, it was the second dinner on that night. probably it's decreasing marginal return, didn't quite like it. and we had extra noodles so that we could share. but there isn't enough soup for the extra noodles. so it was not a good experience  3rd time, tried the shoyu soup with thick noodles. also liked it; it's lighter than the tonkotsu soup. i saw that my bf's extra noodles (original) clumped together...  4th time, tried the tonkotsu black. omg it takes the tonkotsu regular to the next level, even more creamy and rich. this time i had extra noodles but thick.  i think if you want extra noodles, it's better to have it thick because the noodles will still be chewy by the time you're finishing up. but if it's original or thin...it kinda becomes mushy and soak all the soup....  as always, didn't quite like the wait esp. during cold winter times but it's so rewarding after the wait :) also didn't like to have the table by the door every single time...it's so cold when people are getting in and out.  next time i'm gonna try the spicy dandan. i saw other people to my right and to my left ordered this...."}
{"text":"So I came here twice because my friends wanted to try it on 2 separate occasions.  The food comes pretty quickly.  Space was pretty good in comparison to Kinton Ramen or other North York and downtown ramen places where it feels really tight when you sit down.  Here at Sansotei they space it out pretty well.  First time service was pretty good, my cup of water was always full.  The soup base though...was WAY too salty.  Second time I went with another friend of mine (because obviously she wanted to try it...me not so much since the soup base was so salty the 1st time), since the soup base was SO salty the first time I decided to order LESS salt (no salt was not an option) .  I didn't taste a difference in the level of saltiness.  It was still extremely salty.  The noodles, pork belly, egg was pretty decent.  Second time coming here a waitress actually had 1/2 her thumb in the soup while putting down the ramen for my friend.  My friend didn't want to complain because she doesn't like conflict and didn't want to get the waitress in trouble.  It's not like the waitress didn't know her thumb was dipped into the soup but she just put it down as if nothing happened.  No apology just pretended like nothing happened.  Although the noodles had a nice chewy texture to it, it's not enough for me to ever come back.  Overall, the environment was okay.  Spacing was good.  The noodles had a nice texture to it.  But because the soup base was way to salty, I will not be coming back.  The portion was a little small, but that's ok with me."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the location in Markham, so naturally I had to come here. We ordered our usual: Shoyu and Tonkatsu thin noodles for both.  The Tonkatsu taste the same as the Markham location. Almost identical, which I love so that was great.  The Shoyu was similar, but not as salty as the Markham Location one.  Service was quick, waiters were friendly and cheerful - always great to see.  Great job!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch and joined a line up for their 12:00 PM lunch service. Seated immediately, and by 12:15, all the seats were filled. The line continues to grow at that point.  They don't serve side dishes during their lunch service only Ramen. We ordered the spicy ramen and tonkatsu black. Both were good - not too salted like experienced elsewhere and very flavourful. The spicy ramen has a good kick to it which is just right. The ramen come out quick and the service was good. waiter checked on us a few times and didn't try to rush us out even though there was a line, however as a common courtesy, we exited as soon as we paid so other patrons could take our seats. It's a great place to go for a quick delicious lunch if you don't have to wait too long. I would suggest coming right at noon to avoid waiting too long. The only down side is that they don't serve the side dishes on their lunch service."}
{"text":"It is very authentic Japanese Ramen restaurant.  Tonkatsu Ramen is really delicious and the broth is rich and creamy. The eggs are cooked so nicely. Just the way the egg should taste like in Heaven.  The pork meat in the Ramen is tender and full of flavor.  The noodle is soft and chewing.    Overall, the service is friendly and the food are amazing!   P.S.  The wait in the winter is horrible...they make you wait outside in the cold till there's an available opening.  Perhaps, next time I will go in the summer."}
{"text":"This place is over rated and very small portions. So not much value for the price you are paying. We went there today for lunch at 12pm, not much line up or wait. I would not come back for their ramen again. There are other places in Markham/Richmond Hill that you can go to that have better taste, value and better portions with more options. I ordered the Spicy ramen. It only came with 2 eggs and barely any meat. I liked their dessert cake & dumplings more.  I liked the ramen at Sonoya Japanese Noodle House at First Markham place much more. I would not line up to eat here, not worth the wait."}
{"text":"*tears of joy* Even better than I remember.  Sansotei was the ramen game changer for me.  I was never into ramen until I visited the Sansotei in Markham.  Since then I've had CRAVINGS for their Tonkatsu Black.  Funny thing is, I didn't even get the Tonkatsu Black.  All I had was a couple sips of my friend's broth and I fell in love.  I have thought about getting my own bowl ever since.  Just over a week into their opening, I was able to pay the square one location a visit.  To my surprise there wasn't even a wait!  Okay, there was but it was literally 8 mins.  She put my name down at 6:22 and told me to come back by 6:30 lol.  I hardly call that a wait.  All the girls working there were super friendly. This was my boyfriend's first time at ramen.  He decided not to get a soup but instead was interesting in the gyoza. The gyoza came out super fast.  It was delicious!   Nice flavour and texture.  Pretty much all you can expect from gyoza.  My tonkatsu black came out 10 minutes later and boy was I excited.  A few sips of that broth and I was doing my happy dance.  Soooo much flavour.  I opted for the thick noodles, which was a good size for me.  The chashu here seemed thicker than the Markham location, which is fine with me!  I prefer it that way.  Everything about this bowl of goodness was on point.  My boyfriend tried some of my broth and agreed that it was pretty darn good.  I plan to have maaanyyy more visits!  I just hope the wait times don't get crazy!"}
{"text":"I am not a ramen connoisseur but my friends are and they love this place.  My friend had asked me to go to pmall and it was a minus 3 billion degrees cold ass day. So I actually suggested we go for ramen if he wanted to, cuz all I wanted was soup. Bet.  After pmall we headed over as they re-open for dinner at 5pm. The place was rammed just after 5 but we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.  I don't know the different types of ramen but my friend does. He suggested I get the misoblack but I made up my own damn mind and got the tonkotsu based on the description lol. He got the tonkotsublack.  I have to admit their ramen was noticeably delicious. I've tried a couple ramen places in my life but this place was actually a standout. My broth was pretty flavourful but my friend's soup was way tastier. That garlic oil makes all the difference. Always get the garlic oil. I now know this. Also, our broths weren't too salty as other reviews have mentioned. I opted for the thin noodles as the server said the thicker noodles were a bit chewier. Noodles were great and just the right about. My friend and I were both stuffed after but I did manage to finish all the noodles. I couldn't finish the pork though. It was one or the other, or I would have exploded lol.  I would defs recommend this place. I've found that other ramen places are so basic or so salty. Sansotai is a great balance and all flavours are present. This place actually made me enjoy ramen and makes me want to come back!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype of sansotei because it's not good, it's just good for Markham. The most I can say is that it doesn't serve you instant ramen *pointing at you sushi house*   Tonkatsu black is soooo salty. The shoyu ramen actually tastes good while the tonkatsu tastes like someone sprinkled steak powder all over it.  Amy Z. Claims \"sansotei is like sonoya but with less farts.\" I'm deaaaaad."}
{"text":"New location. Grand opening.  They had some promotion going on: order a noodle, a mango cheesecake, and a pop for $15. The ramen was very good. Just as tasty as the original location downtown on dundas street in my opinion. Also ordered gyoza. Extra noodle was huge, same amount as the one in original bowl, which was perfect for me and my kid. The only thing I'd say about this place is, it doesn't have enough four people seating. Not ideal for a small family, which is gonna be the majority of the type of customers up in this location. Kinda a miss for this ramen joint. My family had to be separated in order to be seated fast. Anyhow, I'm happy there's finally a decent ramen place so close to my home. Better than the one at major MacKenzie and bayview location."}
{"text":"By far, the best ramen restaurant in the GTA. The ramen here is the definition of perfection. The pork is absolutely fantastic, full of flavour and great texture. Noodles are chewy. The broth is the true masterpiece. I cannot even compute how they are able produce such a delicious broth. It is simply perfect. Service is great, waitresses are sincere and attentive. They seem to overstaff their dining area which works out all the better for us customers. Pricing and portion is very fair. I am kind of thankful that this restaurant isn't located near my house because I would probably eat here everyday.  The best thing about this restaurant is its consistency, I've returned here more times than I could count and has always been the same, nothing was a fluke. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm, the ramen here is SO good. The broth is nice and milky and salty, the egg was just a little undercooked, which in my books is perfect. The yolk was delicious. The noodles were a bit firm, but tasty nevertheless. The pork was nice and salty.   We also ordered the slow cooked wings, which were bomb! The meat was fall off the bone, and had a little kick to them.   We also got the fried chicken bits which were cripsy, but could have used a touch more seasoning.   What I liked the most about this place was the simplicity. The menu was small, and each item is good. No need for the extra fuss.   It's a pretty small location, so be prepared to wait in line and sit with strangers at the same table. This place isn't meant to hang around and socialize anyway, it's meant for a quick in and out meal.   Service was very friendly and quick.  I can't wait till they open their Markham location so that I can have this deliciousness more often!"}
{"text":"A definite step down from their downtown locations.   We went right at 5pm so we didn't have to line up. Still, the service was slow. We placed out orders, and the food comes out significantly slower than their other locations. Our party consisted of 4 people. My husband's bowl came out first, and the server almost dropped his bowl. He ate for a good 5 minutes before the rest of our bowls came out.. what is the hold up? The same server who almost dropped my husband's bowl, submerged her thumb into my broth a whole thumb! A WHOLE THUMB! But by this point I was starving and I didn't want to send it back, because who knows what would be worse than a thumb.  The broth was however, pretty delicious. I got the tonkatsu black. My husband got the Tomato which was nice and tangy. The other two got tonkatsu original, nice and milky. The egg was nicely done too. The noodles however, were a little hard. Harder than it should have been. But nevertheless, I would still come back due to the location. There is no good ramen up in Markham, so this is the best option."}
{"text":"I always get the tonkotsu or tantan ramen with the thick noodles and they are oh so delicious! It is definitely worth the wait and the price. I also tried their tomato one and I loved the big scallop in it. I would definitely recommend it if you like sweeter broths. I always get their fried chicken (i cannot remember the name for it, but it is waaaay better than your usual karaage). I am from Montreal and whenever I am in Toronto, I always go to Sansotei."}
{"text":"February 11, 2018 - The ramen here is good! First time ever going it was nice. The price was good also. I ordered ramen with shrimp, the shrimp are so big"}
{"text":"Overall I really enjoyed the ramen at Sansotei. I like that they offer the option for both thick and thin noodles. We ordered both thick and thin and my preference is the thin although both were good. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen and my sister ordered the miso black ramen. I really liked the black fungus in my tonkotsu but I felt I might have enjoyed the tonkotsu black with garlic oil more as the broth in my ramen could use a kick of spicy to add more depth of flavor to the milky broth. The miso ramen broth was good but a bit salty. One small complaint I have is that their eggs seemed to be pre made and placed into the ramen from the fridge as the eggs were still cold in the ramen. The spicy slow cooked wings were not spicy at all which was disappointing."}
{"text":"The broth here is absolutely delicious. I actually finished the entire bowl (including the broth) because it was that good (or I could've been really hungry from the wait). So far, this has been by far one of the better ramens i've had and the portion is JUST right. If you happened to have brought a friend who is not a fan of ramen, there's the fried chicken and rice you can order.  The service here was fantastic. Although we waited a long time for our table, the staff continued to be friendly despite how crowded and busy it was. I'm going to tell you if you have a small party (2 person) you probably won't have to wait so long, but if you have a larger group, expect to wait longer. The spacing was decent for a ramen place too. The ramen places I've been to have been quite small but this one was more spacious than the others. Could be because there's more space in the suburbs of Markham?   Will probably come back and will try to come on the not so busy times."}
{"text":"I had pretty high expectations going in and I can say that they were more or less met.  We arrived at around 11:30 but we were only seated at 12. We arrived first, but they seated at least 10 people before our group. The restaurant is small and so space is limited, but I suggest if you're interested in going, limit your party to around 4 people (we were a party of 5).  I ordered the black tonkatsu ramen with extra chasu. The broth was actually much too salty for my liking - it was really rich and delicious at first, but as I progressed I felt myself getting more and more thirsty. I think it was the garlic oil that made it too salty, so I would recommend getting the original tonkatsu. I also got the original noodles... It was well cooked, but if I were to go again I would definitely opt for the thicker noodles for more of a bite. The chasu (pork belly) was oh so tender, but it was, again, a bit too salty for my liking.  The wait staff was kind and attentive, and although they were probably quite interested in ushering us out, they were still hospitable and kind."}
{"text":"We were only a couple of blocks away from Sansotei so we decided to walk over there.  We turned the corner and from a distance we could see a line...mind you it's about 25 degrees (not sure what that is in celsius).  We decided that we would stick it out, a Japanese lady came out, gave us a number and said the wait would be about a half hour...not bad I thought.  In reality we waited for an hour in the freezing cold by now the temperature had dropped quite considerably.    BUT...once we got inside the smells and sights of the food was very exciting!  I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen w/ added veggies  (combo of asian mushrooms, bean sprouts and bamboo shoots) and my hubs had Tonkotsu Ramen w/ extra chashu (sliced pork belly) and we both got the thick noodles.  We also ordered a side of Cha-han (friend rice).   It was AWESOME!  The broth had the right balance of salty and richness, sometimes Tonkotsu ramen can smell a little bit, this one did not!  I really liked the thick noodles because it was still firm as I finished up my last bite, you never want to take so long in taking to eat your ramen where the noodles become really soft...that's gross!  It was totally worth the wait, we will be back here again very soon!"}
{"text":"The ramen here more accurately gets a 4.5/5 stars! I ordered the Spicy Tantan ramen with extra pork belly. I would've given it a 5/5 but the broth was slightly on the salty side. Next time I'll ask for it to be less salty if that's possible. I mean it should be since all they would have to do is add a little water to my bowl before they serve me it. Anyway the Spicy Tantan came out steaming hot, with the noodles perfectly cooked. Don't be worried the Spicy Tantan is not all that spicy at all, trust me. I'll never order anything other than the Spicy Tantan from here, that's how much I love it."}
{"text":"I walked in right before the lunch-hour rush and somehow found seating for my party of five after a small wait. After we arrived, a long line formed outside the restaurant. If you plan on eating here avoid peak times or arrive early.  I ordered the Shoyu ramen with thick noodles. First thing that surprised me was the small portion for $9.50. It was overpriced, but the meal was ridiculously small. I was still hungry after walking out.   The ramen itself had a soft and tender pork belly complimented by a salty broth. Although I chose thick noodles, the noodles were very thin and could have fooled me as thin noodles.  It is also worth mentioning that the food came extremely fast but the service felt rushed since they needed to serve the customers outside in the line.  The ramen isn't bad, but in a city with an oversaturation of ramen places to eat at, the line-up and prices don't justify the food."}
{"text":"Outstanding Ramen. Order the thick noodles even though they recommend the thin. There is always a line to get in. I recommend coming at around 1:30pm or 11:30am. The service is generally fast but the wait can be up to 30 minutes at a busy time."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen again. Tonkotsu black with extra pork belly doesn't disappoint. Next time I shall try a spicier option which other yelpers have recommended, to make a comparison with one of my favourites from Kinton."}
{"text":"me not an egg person, but the egg comes with the noodle soup is just sth else. so watery soft in side and more solid on the outside part, just enough to hold the liquid. only thing I'd say to improve is the soup being too salty, which happen to be the case for all ramen places I've ever tried since."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tokatsu Black ramen with thick noodles. The ramen had a balanced soup base and a delicious black garlic oil which sits on the top of the broth. I mix the oil into the broth and makes the dish more savory. If you are not a fan of garlic, not to worry,the taste is not overwhelming by any means. However, they also have miso ramen which also looked delicious beside me. Each time I visit the restaurant, I order the same thing and leave satisfied. Their noodles are left al dente and nothing is overcooked. From their eggs to the pork in the soup, each item is seasoned well and still fresh. Their fried chicken is also delicious, with a very light batter which leaves the chicken light and airy. They serve it with a lemon slice which adds the hint of freshness to the dish.   The staff are very friendly and the service is quick. They restaurant is very narrow and fills up quickly so I would recommend dining at off hours such as 11:30am or you will need to wait in line. Having tried other ramen restaurants, I find that their broth has depth of flavor that other restaurants do not. Whether you are craving soup on a cold day or just looking for some great noodles, this restaurant is a must try in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Pretty good ramen, the price is pretty average but a little on the expensive side.  It's nice to have a good ramen place uptown around the corner though.  The first time I went there, the waitress told me there was no sesame paste in their soup when I ordered, but there was and I got pretty ill.   The second time I went, it was fine.  Their soup is flavourful and the noodles are cooked to perfection so that they're not too soggy giving it a nice chewy texture."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen location!!! It is small though so there tends to be a line.  You get a selection on noodles if I recall correctly, so I had the Tonkatsu ramen with regular noodles. Their soup is fantastic, and their egg is so nicely done that I've been drooling over it the moment I got it. The only complaint I have is for their meat, since it is a bit on the rough side comparing to Santouka couple blocks away. It feels like you are chewing meat, rather than meat melting in your mouth.  Overall, not bad at all! Will return again if I am craving ramen."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to eat at Sansotei for lunch today. There was a lineup outside and we had to wait around 15 minutes, but it went by fast. The waitresses were very friendly and quick to serve us. I ordered Tonkotsu black ramen, my bf ordered Spicy Tantan and we got the deep fried chicken to share. My ramen was very rich in flavour and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The deep fried chicken was very tasty too. So far I think Sansotei is the best ramen restaurant in Toronto and we will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"This is a solid place for Ramen. The Ramen broth has a rich flavour without being too salty. While there are few creative surprises, the Ramen bowls are full, hearty, and right for any cool or ass-freezingly cold Toronto day.  You may have to line up outside, but the line moves quickly. Come early (by 1130) or late (after 1) for less waits.  The food comes out quickly. Service is better than many similar establishments.  The restaurant is bustling, crowded, and yet clean. Even the downstairs bathrooms are clean!  This is a great place for lunch. If you are into Ramen, you may find this to be one of, if not the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"+Noodle quality is ok +Good varied selection of ramen -Soup base is far too salty -Long line-ups whilst standing outside"}
{"text":"I've been trying out ramen all over town (Isshin, Raijin, Santouka, and Kinton), but the Tonkotsu black ramen at Sansotei stands way out from the rest of the crowd for me.   The noodles are springy, the broth is rich, and the \"black fungus\" (wood ear mushrooms) are a great addition. It's seriously the best around.  (I've also tried the other varieties, including the spicy Tantan, but they don't reach the same level of perfection as the Tonkotsu black, in my opinion)"}
{"text":"On par with their other locations in Markham and Downtown Toronto. This location is around the same size as the one downtown so there's limited seating and always a line at the door. Service is spectacular as usual and food consistently delicious.   I'd recommend visiting just before peak hours to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 5 times this year, since trying it for the first time in January. The restaurant is small (and a little too cozy) but the service is great and very polite.   As usual, of downtown restaurants, there is no parking unless you park on a side street. During the lunch hour, if you get there past 12, you can expect to wait in line outside for around 20 minutes before getting seated. It's quite small inside, probably seats around 25 people.  The soup is here pretty good. My personal favorite is the Spicy Tantan. Though the name suggests spicy, there's not a lot of kick which is perfect for me. I also love the soft boiled egg they serve with some of their ramen choices. Their karaage is also well seasoned and fried to a light crisp. The portion sizes are great for a quick lunch, but for those with a bigger appetite, you should definitely order more noodles."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for some ramen before a Raptors game. Didn't expect such a long line! Got in after about 15 minutes though as the turnaround seems quick.  Ordered the Tonkotsu Black, with extra noodles (on the side, as recommended by my friend). The soup was decadent. Very good flavour and the extra noodles was definitely worth it. You should order it on the side so that it remains fresh and chewy while you finish your first batch. There's more than enough soup broth to go around. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I've actually come here a few times now, but only just getting around to reviewing it now. Unfortunately I feel like it isn't as good as it once was. (Side note, this was my first ramen back since a Japan trip)  This time, I got the Miso Black. This is one of the prettiest bowls they have. The broth is thick and oily with the garlic oil. Taste is rich and flavour is good. I still think it was one of the better Ramens in Toronto. Also think I prefer the Tonkotsu Black more.  Also had a side karaage. Nothing special"}
{"text":"Rarely have I seen the bottom of my ramen bowl. The last time was at the top of a ski hill in Hokkaido.  The short wait in line was well worth it! Getting the booth at the back was an added bonus! The spicy slow cooked wings were a bit of a disappointment despite their tenderness. The Gyoza was plain and simple.  What was outstanding was the Miso Black Ramen... sumptuous, dynamic and full of flavour! I'll be back for more of that!  ???????????"}
{"text":"My recent regular dining partners had plans to go out for dinner but one of them bailed to go out with her daughter and niece so we invited ourselves to tag along. LOL!  Unfortunately, we got there a bit late and they had already consumed all their appetizers - Gyoza (dumplings), Zangi (fried chicken), and Seaweed Salad. They said it was good. There was barely any evidence left.  Most of us ordered the Tonkotsu Black ramen, a rich pork broth with chashu (pork belly), soft boiled egg, black fungus, green onions, and noodles, topped with a roasted garlic oil. I ordered extra pork belly and took advantage of a special deal that included a bottle of Sapporo beer for only $14.00. Good deal.  The other dish was the Miso Black ramen, also served with pork belly, soft boiled egg, shiitake mushrooms, green onions, and noodles, topped with the roasted garlic oil.  We were very happy with our choices. The broth was very rich in flavour and, while the portion was just right, I probably could have eaten more. It was that good. Now I know where to go for a good bowl of soup and noodles!"}
{"text":"My favorite ramen in Toronto. They have two locations, I still think the downtown one is slightly better. However, this location is still very good.  I usually get the regular tonkatsu, the broth is very flavourful and rich. My husband enjoys the tomato broth ramen."}
{"text":"There always seem to be a people lined up waiting for this place, but luckily it doesn't take long for people to slurp down noodles so the tables turn over relatively quickly. We came on a Saturday night to a 20 minute wait, so it wasn't too bad.  I got the Tonkotsu Black: pork base broth with black garlic oil. The broth was not too salty or oily but still flavorful, a good mix of seasoning. The noodles are nice and chewy, the toppings are pretty regular with the egg cooked perfectly but the star of the show was definitely the oil-slick black garlic floating on the top of the broth. I liked how that was an regular option on the menu and you didn't have to add it on additionally. Also, If you are lucky, you may even get a random orchid flower floating in your broth as decoration."}
{"text":"I love noodles in soup, I love ramen. And Sansotei is one of the best ramen shops in Toronto. I alternate between shoyu and shiyo ramen's and I commend them on the efforts to add new dishes to their menu, which are great tasting in their own respects but I still prefer the more traditional shoyu and shiyo broths. I used to come here more often when they first opened and the line ups weren't so long. Come here less so now. Go to the one near Yonge and Bloor if you want less wait time - the quality in my experience is about the same between the two locations."}
{"text":"I finally got to go to Sansotei Ramen with a friend when I came back from NYC. Surprisingly, the line-up wasn't long at all (but apparently i got lucky), and they hadn't run out with soup yet (because I hear they tend to run out early).  What was interesting that they would try to separate people as much as they can, which is nice, because sometimes it gets awkward when you're talking about stuff and sitting next to some people.  Had myself the miso soup - which wasn't bad.  I wasn't ultra full in the end, which was nice, because usually I'm really tired after eating some ramen."}
{"text":"I was surprised to learn that they opened a new Sansotei uptown (or... I guess what they call \"downtown Markham\" now). Sansotei never disappoints. My friend got there a bit earlier than I did, and he quickly had a seat. We both got the tonkatsu black -- you can't go wrong with garlic oil. Needless to say, I devoured that bowl of ramen (my friend asked me if I was hungry -- I was, but I also love ramen).  On top of that, we ordered the fried chicken (zengi) -- this was pretty good too.  Will definitely have to come back here, considering that it's only a 15 minute drive from my parents' place.  However, PREPARE FOR LINES. It's not as crazy as the one downtown. And you can actually wait inside!"}
{"text":"Let me just start this by saying, DON'T BUY INTO THE HYPE.  First off, their gyoza tastes like just a chinese dumpling. DON'T GET IT, WASN'T WORTH IT. Got a bowl of tonkotsu and tonkotsu black which both were kind of disappointing. THE BLACK GARLIC OIL TASTES LIKE IF I COOKED A STEAK AND POURED THE LEFT OVER OIL INTO MY RAMEN. The pork was firm yet chewy but the egg was cooked perfectly. On top of it all, it was super salty and the portions are smaller in comparison to most ramen places.   The service is nice and they're quick but the actual waiting time is 30 mins or so.   I would have rather gone to ajisen ramen."}
{"text":"I had the black tonkatsu ramen with thin noodles. Its \"black\" because of the garlic oil. Although the oil made the broth taste amazing and more flavourful compared to the regular tonkatsu ramen after finishing I found it to be a bit much.   With the broth being tol intense for my liking  if I were to go back again I would try something a bit lighter. For dessert my friend and I had the daifuku and it was great!  The menu was easy and simple and the prices were not bad."}
{"text":"Great ramen along with decent price.  However, I wish the ramen was served little warmer.  By the time when the dish was on table, we couldn't see any steam from the bowls.  Great taste though.  I would come again."}
{"text":"Consistent with their other locations, can't really complain much from this establishment.  Glad that there's a decent spot for Ramen in York Region."}
{"text":"The first few bite was ok, but the soup was too heavy and milky, I could not finished it. The noddle is not the real ramen noddle. There is not much side in it (no bamboo shoot, bean spourts or seaweed). and they charge for hot tea! The only good thing is they poached the egg right."}
{"text":"Always love Sansotai Ramen. I first know the store near the Dundas Station, I will try it almost every time I went to eaton centre, now I just got to know there was one in Yonge and Finch! I just moved in to this neighbourhood and I cannot wait to eat the ramen... the soup is always strong, as I missed! I always add extra noodle. The price is also reasonable!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a huge fan of many ramen places as they serve extremely oily and greasy soups, however, this might be one of my all time favourite restaurants right now.   Their Spicy Tan Tan is no question one of their staple pieces as everyone talks about it. However, the best thing I find about this place is that every ramen in the menu is delicious in its own way. I find this true as each soup pairs well with either thick or thin noodles, depends on your preference.   The thick noodles had more elasticity or chewiness to them, while the thin noodles felt more like the traditional ones you'd find at many other ramen places."}
{"text":"Wonderful Ramen shop.   Ambience - quite romantic and classy. Menu - the design is simple and gets to the point. There are also not an overwhelming amount of selection to throw off an ambivalent person like myself, and my partner.  Taste - we both ordered Spicy TanTan noodle($13 after tax and tip) which was very very satisfying, not to mention spicy just right! Service - the server was efficient which is what i expect from all japanese restaurants.   All in all, perfect."}
{"text":"Tried several different ramen places and this one still stands out in terms of overall quality."}
{"text":"Great place. Good noodles. I don't know what else you should expect from Ramen places. They've got everything you need pretty much."}
{"text":"Ordered the fried chicken and black garlic ramen. The fried chicken was ok, not very crispy and not as flavorful as I was expecting. The ramen was creamy and garlicky w/ a perfectly yolky soft boiled egg. Too bad the chashu pork wasn't as flavorful or savory as it looked. Considering the other ramen options, I couldn't rank Sansotei higher."}
{"text":"Finally a decent ramen shop in uptown.  Taste very similar to downtown location with a lot more seating spaces.  Attended friends and family night for soft opening and the shop was pack.  You can choose between thin or thick noodle and the egg was perfectly boil.  Really looking forward to try the tomato soup base & will come back and order Asahi Black :)"}
{"text":"I will agree that the soup is on the salty side. But the ramen is still really good!  We got the spicy tan tan and the tonkotsu with thick noodles (curly, great for slurping and retaining the soup). I loved both the broths. The tonkotsu had a good pork bone flavor with this creaminess that comes when it's cooked with the ramen. The tan tan was spicy, but just enough that you want to keep on slurping the ramen and drinking the soup! By the way, there is only one slice of pork belly for the tan tan but two for the tonkotsu.  Adding any extras, like shitaki mushrooms, will cost you more, but I definitely recommend adding the mushrooms because it has a sweet flavor that complements the salitness very well.  I would NOT recommend getting the gyoza - it's mediocre for the price really, and their star is the ramen. Would want to go back again for the ramen!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give a better rating. I have been to the location downtown and I always thought it was my #3 favourite ramens in TO. After a visit to this location, I'm not so sure anymore.   I ordered the tonkatsu black ramen, gyoza and spicy slow cooked wings.   The good = broth flavour, ramen texture, gyoza, service, wings flavour   The bad = broth was lukewarm, wings were not feather free  The bad unfortunately were pretty major things, but can be easily fixed! If I return, hope things will be better next time."}
{"text":"There's a few chains now all over Toronto, and even in neighbouring cities... I've been to some of their locations a few times now and I would say in general, they are pretty consistent in terms of producing the noodles - i tend to order the same one everytime :)  I love the black garlic ramen - I usually just get that, and something about the black garlic oil makes it really addictive.   I love their noodles - it's nicely cooked, the texture is not too chewy, nice spring to it and not overcooked. the meat is seasoned well, and their egg is always perfectly soft boiled. I liked the sides that comes with the ramen, and their broth - well packed with flavour, but when you drink it you don't feel that it's excessively salty (it is hidden in there though! but the flavour is balanced out).  Def. worth checking out this chain if you haven't tried yet."}
{"text":"I love all type of noodles or pasta! Japanese ramen, why not????? Throughout my indecisiveness, when I don't know what to eat, I usually choose ramen, I have tried Ajisen and Kinton, so far I like all of them and now I finally got to tried Samsotei after many people recommending me this ramen place.... It literally took me 1 year (as I was hesitant)..... ok now to the review....  I ordered myself the black tonkotsu, thick noodles. It comes with egg, garlic oil??, spring onion, black fungus? And ofc pork bellehhh..... I mean I love the thick soup with all its mighty ingredients! The taste is excellent and everything is so flavourful! I love it to be honest, I also added gyoza too(nothing special to talk about the gyoza since is just the typical). I would compare it to Kinton, I mean I like the combination of what they put in the ramen from samsotei and their thick noodles seems to taste better here, maybe just me :/... however I like how Kinton serve their pork betters, more charred :D  Price wise, they ranges from 11+ so depend of what you decide to order. I definitely enjoyed this place and I would definitely come back.  It seems to always have line up as well...... the place looks good, no complain, just need to put their a/c a bit higher and Ima a happy person!"}
{"text":"The black miso soup base was good. Overall it was good except the noodles were stuck together in a chunk and partially uncooked.  The tomato soup ramen was good too but only one slice of pork belly seemed really stingy lol. The hot tea is also a $2 charge, fyi."}
{"text":"First time at this new location and we will be back! Great service and great food! New favourite is the Tomato Ramen with the jumbo shrimp."}
{"text":"One of our favourite Ramen places and the Markham location is just as good as the original one. Conveniently located in downtown Markham.  It's usually busy here but worth the wait. Their service is pretty good and food comes out pretty quick.  Our faves are the original and tan tan with thin noodles. The noodles have a great chew and broth is addicting good."}
{"text":"Their ramen is super delicious! The soup was a little too salty for me but other than that, it was amazing! The service was great. Everyone was so kind and patient! The ramen came very quickly after we ordered as well. This place is extremely popular so there will probably be a wait when you arrive. I definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Sansotei, what happened? This used to be my go-to place for ramen, but I think I'll have to start looking for a new haunt. I took my brother here for lunch today and was lucky enough to snag a seat right away (there is usually a line outside the door).  We got the zangi (deep fried chicken) to start. I hadn't had this dish before and it came to us piping hot with lemon to squeeze over it as seasoning. Honestly, if it weren't for the amazingness of this side, I would bump this review down to three stars. This is a great appetizer, and I highly recommend it!  My brother ordered the tonkotsu with extra egg, noodles and pork belly. I got the miso for myself. You have a choice of thick or thin noodles now, and can add extra of any toppings for an added charge.  The miso broth was flavorful as always and the egg and corn were delicious,  but the pork belly was stomach-turning and I gave the rest of mine to my brother after one bite. Quality of that has definitely gone down. I didn't enjoy the noodles as much as I have in the past either.  I tried some of my brother's tonkotsu broth and was grossed out, but he seemed to enjoy it. Not sure if they've changed their recipe or my palate has just rearranged itself but it wasn't as good as I remembered. The service is great and the girls get people in and out quickly, so even if you are waiting in line, it usually doesn't take too long."}
{"text":"Just really good ramen..   tonkotsu is my favorite but the tomato broth ramen was delicious for a change. quick turn around, so don't be scared by lineups cuz they move really quick. Really worth it."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous yelper. Tonkotsu ramen was good. The soup is better than Kinton. The zangi chicken was yummy. I thought this place is better than Kinton and momofuku noodle bar Toronto. You can actually have a conversation at this place. Kinton is too loud.   Yes, wish they had free tea!"}
{"text":"Reliable Ramen. That's alliteration I could definitely go for. This is my #2 ramen spot in the city (Kinton is my #1, just like another review below). I used to work near this location, and would often drop by at lunchtime whenever I was feeling for nice, comforting, delicious, well-cooked ramen. However, it did take me awhile to try it out, as the lineups are absolutely ridonkulous, especially in the wintertime. (But note that, despite the crazy lineups, the servers here have a system going and they know how to handle the lines pleasantly and efficiently).  I'd usually come by at off-peak hours, around 11:00 AM, or for a late-late lunch around 2:00 PM, so I'd avoid having to wait for a table. I've had the Spicy Tan-Tan, the Shio, and the Tonkatsu black. All are absolutely delicious, minimal oil in the broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and decently cooked pork belly. The meat isn't as tender as other ramen joints (i.e. the melt-in-your-mouth-is-this-really-meat? kind, but it's still very delicious). The broth is also nice and tasty. Overall, it's not knock-you-out-of-the-park ramen, but it's reliable - not perfect, but you can always count on it for a good meal.  For one person, with tax and tip, I'd usually pay, on average, around $13.00."}
{"text":"Had the chance to try out this place over the weekend and ordered the tonkotsu (creamy pork bone flavour) - which comes with pork belly, soft boiled egg, black fungus, and green onion. I had this with the thick noodles and I found that the portion like any other ramen place was average - one serving worth. You have the option of ordering another serving of noodles as long as you still have the soup base (costs 1.50).  No complaints, it was tasty and I could see myself coming back again (the meal was 9.60). It got packed around 6:30pm, I assume that's usually the more peak times for this restaurant."}
{"text":"??????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????2????????????????????????????????????????????2?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????...????????????????????1?2????????????  ???3???????????????????????????????????????????????Good????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ????????????????????????????????????????1???4???????????1??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????   ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Very nice staff here but I didn't enjoy the food here. There were very minimal options on the menu but the option of less salt was pretty neat. I truthfully wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"I think this is becoming my favourite Sansotei location, because it's located uptown so it's more likely that I can walk in and be seated immediately.   The space is more comfortable too because the store is bigger than the downtown locations.  My go to ramen dish is the Tonkatsu Black because the black garlic oil adds really good flavour that complements the soup. Generally I request my soup to be less salted and even then I still find it saltier than I like.   There are also other items on the menu such as snacks and desserts, but those I find to be over priced with very small portions, so I would usually just get the ramen."}
{"text":"**I did not actually tried their food, but the experience was crappy enough to deserve a bad review**  It was Friday night so I decided to come out for dinner with some friends (group of 5). We heard this place is pretty busy during weekends so we actually left work early to try out this place. 2 of my friends come first and got sat down to wait for us to come. They were sitting at a 6 person table and 2 other customers were already eating at that table. When the 3 of us came the table wasn't ready yet. The waitress then told my other 2 friends who already sat down to get up and leave the store with the rest of us and wait outside in the cold. Like who does that??!! What kind of restaurant would tell their customers to get up and leave just because they have more friends coming to eat and spend money. What I couldn't stand was the attitude of the waitresses. If they told us nicely that there isn't enough room to stand around and we have to wait outside I would have been fine with it. But the treatment we got was literally like THEY WERE TREATING US LIKE TRESPASSERS. The waitress basically pressured us to leave with the facial expression that basically says \"we don't care if you got a crappy service because will be enough people around the corner willing to line up for a seat\". Needless to say after the got out of the restaurant we didn't bother waiting for a seat big enough for 5 of us and just left to go to a restaurant nearby. If this is how you're treating your customers then I don't care how good your food is, I am taking my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I compare all other ramen I ever taste to the Dundas street location's Tonkotsu Black with thin noodles. It's literally my idea of perfect ramen. Perfectly cooked egg, perfecty done noodles, delicious melt-in-your-mouth pork, super speedy service. Just perfect."}
{"text":"????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????"}
{"text":"My husband gives this place a 5 star (but 4 star for me).  We had the tonkatsu black and the spicy tantan.  The spicy tantan seemed to lack depth and the spicy level was just not there. But I'm southeast asian and I've had the spicy ones at Ippudo in Japan (really spicy).  But this ramen grew on me and towards the end, it was really good!   The tonkatsu black was really delicious and smells like heaven with garlic goodness but really greasy. Compared to places that I've been to in the US, these two ramen dishes were really balanced and really good!  And the noodles - perfection!  Oh, ramen only cost 10 cad which is cheap!  Unfortunately they ran out of the wings at 7pm and we opted for the fried chicken which was boring. Don't get it unless you like boring."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! The Miso Ramen and broth was amazing. The place gets very busy with lineups outside of the door often."}
{"text":"- I have tried tonkotsu black, spicy tan tan, tiramisu daifuku and matcha cheesecake - Food quality:        + ramens: the soup was salty, too little of noodles and meat, overall not impressed with their ramen. I prefer kenzo ramen over this place.        + Tiramisu daifuku: it's tastes more like a chocolate mochi, nothing special. I still think the Lotte mochi selling in korean supermarket are much better and cheaper         + Matcha cheesecake: Pretty good actually. I have to say this cheesecake was the highlight of my dinner. It has strong matcha flavour and very well balanced. - Portion: small, I was not full with one bowl of ramen  - Price: I thought the price was ok, but the portion was small so I would say it's a bit on the pricey side  - The place was small, tables are so closed to each other, making it hard to go in and out.  - Overall, it was not worth the hype at all."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tonkotsu with thin noodles ($10.50). There was a line up when we came, but turnover is fast so the wait wasn't long. The fast turnover is highly due to the fact that they clear away your bowl immediately after you finish and ask if you want anything else, prompting you to either order dessert or simply ask for the bill. I'm not a huge fan of this as it makes me feel a bit rushed.   The food came quick and the noodles were good. I love the eggs and pork belly that came with it.   Will come back again if I want ramen.   Also, I overheard the table next to us ask the waiter how big a serving the extra noodles were and she said it's as much as you get in a normal bowl of noodles. So if you're a big eater, it is definitely worth it to pay the $1.50 for extra noodles!"}
{"text":"Excellent ramen place. The \"black\" ramen varieties are the unique offerings here, so I'd recommend trying those. The other types are commonly found at any other ramen joint, and I'm not convinced that they would make them significantly better than any of the other A-level ramen places. Every now and then, you might find yourself waiting in line with a few Japanese people even, which always inspires confidence knowing that it's \"up to par\" with their own expectations.  The lineup is long and you will be stuck waiting outside. n the winter especially, it's by no means a comfortable experience. Even when seated, you are cramped and potentially sharing a table with a stranger, and every time the door is opened you are greeted by a cold gust.   It's also a shame that their menu is really small, would have appreciated a few more sides or other things to munch on (I think out of all the ramen places I've been to, Sansotei might have the smallest menu)."}
{"text":"I should probably preface this review by being honest about how I feel about ramen in general. I'm one of those people that likes it just fine and no more than that; I am not a ramen conoisseur nor a broth sommelier (Plus as a carnivore I'm not the biggest fan of having to drink my food).  We went to this place based on positive word of mouth reviews. Now, perhaps there's something I'm missing, but I found the food we had to be decent and that's about it. The noodles were good, the broth was tasty, and the gyoza we had were also alright. But nothing I experienced would lead me to ever want to come back here again in a hurry (except the service, which was fantastic). Furthermore, I've had other ramen in Toronto that I found better anyway.  So if you're in the area and want to give it a shot you're not gonna be unhappy you went. But maybe, like me, that one shot will be all you decide to give it."}
{"text":"Having passed this place many times, I could safely say that this is the line that rivals Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecake..and for good reasons too. This was probably the best ramen I ever had in Toronto. Here's what I thought about it.  + Amazing broth, my friend and I both tried separate ramen, and both had deep rich flavours. Easily a mile better than Kinton & Raijin, and worlds better than Momofuku Noodle Bar. There is no comparison, this is the ramen restaurant you've been looking for. + Side dishes (in this case the fried chicken) were delicious as accompaniments to the ramen. Everything tasted fresh and made to order. Side orders are small and portioned nicely because the ramen should be the star of the show. + Some people might disagree, but the overall ambience and tight space in the restaurant is very comforting. Tables are close together, but the conversations gives the restaurant a very homey feel. + Very friendly staff, routinely filled water, not overly distracting, fast service + Priced adequately  - Lines are long on most days, if you're unlucky, you could be waiting 30+ minutes - The ramen had just the right amount of noodles, but not enough toppings - Sadly no reservations"}
{"text":"This incarnation of Sansotei recently opened for soft opening. A lot of their staff are still being trained, but so far service has been very attentive.  There are roughly 10 booths for 2 people facing each other, and one center area to accommodate a group up to roughly 12 people if you combine the tables. So for example, a small family would likely take up this area fully. So multiple large groups may cause some waiting, better to call ahead. Otherwise if your on a date there's no problem with seating.  The menu is pretty simple and straight forward, which is totally fine as long as the food is good.  This was our second visit here already, and the broth is nice and thick. We tried the black miso, black tonkatsu and tantan noodles. The tantan was the least appealing, while the black tonkatsu was very tasty. It comes with two different cuts of meat, some seasoned mushrooms and a nice thick broth.  For sides we have tried the slow cooked wings and zangi (deep fried) chicken. The slow cooked wings were very uninspired. Tasty, but it's $6 for 5 wings that is wet flavored (think spicy soy cooked). The zangi chicke is quite tasty, not the usual thick breaded crunchy kaarage, a lightly battered chicken pieces.  Overall this place is a welcome addition to the Yonge street corridor in Richmond Hill.  The next closest ramen place that I consider good is another 10 minute drive from this location, so you bet I will be coming back."}
{"text":"The service was great and timely  The waitress is so nice I feel very welcomed. Decoration is nice, environment is quite and seating is comfortable and clean.  The food was great! I ordered spicy tantan and my bf ordered the tomato ramen. Both were perfect. The soup is thick but not salty compared to other authentic Japanese ramen. The portion is perfect for a girl but might not be enough for guys. So remember to add noodle or extra chashu!"}
{"text":"Sansotei Markham is in the Whole Foods plaza on Birchmount and 7. There is plenty of parking. We went in on a Wednesday at 1 and there was quite a bit of space. No wait. There was a constant stream of people coming in though so I can't even begin to imagine what this place is like on weekends.  Service was friendly and efficient - we got what we ordered very quickly after we ordered it so no waiting and getting hangry.  Got the miso black which has garlic oil - the flavor is very strong which I enjoy but some may not. The broth is quite salty but acceptable - the ramen I got with garlic oil at Kiu was even saltier if you can imagine that. It is also saltier than the regular tonkatsu broth I think. I like the thick noodles best! They have a spring to it when you bite and it's nice. The pork they give you is also quite fatty and soft. Softer than Kiu(Ramen Isshin?).   It's a simple meal but satisfying. Their chicken karaage is ok - I think Kiu' s is better actually and kinton. Tonkatsu is the cheapest thing, miso black is the most expensive at around 12 dollars - still not too expensive as far as meals  go!"}
{"text":"The new Sansotei Ramen is open at Fort York and Dan Leckie. Had an absolutely incredible experience today.   Walked in at 5:42 (no line at all on Saturday of opening week) Ordered at 5:45 Food in front of me by 5:55  Absolutely incredible ramen. Some of the best I've ever had. I had the Tonkatsu Black with Extra Pork Belly.   Excellent service Excellent speed Excellent ramen   Will 100% be coming here often. So amazing to have this right across the street from me.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The first few times I had ramen, I was not a fan... but now I know why!  It wasn't Sansotei's TONKOTSU BLACK ramen!!!   The restaurant is small but popular so there's usually a line outside.  I went just after lunch hour during the week and only had to wait a minute or two. To increase capacity, they do table sharing, which isn't necessarily bad as ramen only takes a few minutes to eat :)  About TONKOTSU BLACK:  - The ramen soup is warm, rich and full of flavor.  I saw on their website that it's pork bone soup made fresh daily.   - Decorated with fresh green onions - Drizzled with garlic oil  - Two slices of pork belly - One soft boiled egg halved - This bowl goes best with thin noodles! - Caramelized onions - Black garlic sauce - Very satisfying to eat!!!"}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying that I'm not a ramen connoisseur.  Ok, correction, I'm not a Japanese ramen connoisseur.  Sure, I have my noodle attacks as frequently as the next guy but most of my ramen experience range from home made instant variety to a few challenging bowls at Zyng and Kenzo.    My hubby and I went to Sansotei while we were looking for Santouka.  I was misinformed that Santouka was already open (which it's not!) and walked into this little ramen shop.  Since enough people have commented on the decor and other stuff I'll get right to the food.   We ordered Miso ramen, Donkotsu Shoyu ramen and a green tea mochi ice cream (only kind they had available at the time).  Miso ramen came with a boiled egg (nice and medium), 2 pieces of ChaShu (port belly), corn, bean sprouts and topped with a generous mound of chopped green onion.  The broth was milky looking and tasted mildly porky and hearty.  I didn't really taste too much miso but it was well balanced nonetheless.  The noodles were cooked to perfect chewiness, not too chewy and not too mushy.  So far so good.    Donkotsu Shoyu came topped with the same boiled egg, ChaShu, bamboo shoots and chopped green onion.  The broth was clearer than my Miso ramen and tasted a lot porkier which was a definite minus for me.    Green tea mochi was just a ok.  I would have liked to try a different one as I'm not a huge fan of green tea ice creams.  It's just been overdone in the City, in my opinion.  I would have preferred either red bean or taro.    All in all, the service was efficient, food was decent but I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to eat here again.  I'm definitely waiting for Santouka for my next downtown ramen jaunt."}
{"text":"I don't know if the GTA will ever truly have ramen as good as in Japan, but this place is the closest I have had.   I feel like each ramen place does a couple things really well.  Like if you could have the broth of Santouka, the chasu of Kinton, and Sansotei's noodles, it would be pretty damn awesome!    But this place hits most of the notes really well and I would say overall is the best in and around TO and is actually better than its downtown counterpart.  Had the Black Garlic ramen.  Delicious.  Long lineups so either go early like at 5pm or go late at 9pm."}
{"text":"It's an ok place for ramen. Nothing to write home about but decent enough to have lunch if you happen to be in the area. Remember to call if they are actually open for business, they don't open for food service all day, I believe they close in between lunch and dinner service. Also, certain days they're not open as well.  The price isn't overly expensive but the portion is not great as well. If you're hungry and a big eater, order extra maybe. I've been a few time, but don't really remember anything good or bad.   Taste *** Price *** Portion **"}
{"text":"Good ramen ! I liked that they did not skimp on the egg which many ramen places do...they usually give one egg but this place gives 2! After 5pm there will be a line but it seems to move quickly... i got the last seat in the place but it was next to the kitchen which made it really hot. The pricing for ramen is really good... but they don't give as much as other ramen places in terms of noodle/soup. It tasted really good and I would go back if i come back to toronto. I got the black sesame oil one with thin noodles and my mom got the spicy one with thick noodles. The noodles are more al dente than i am use to- but the soup was yummy! I did not like the cha shiu- very dry...  Get a sapporo ! you'll thank me :)"}
{"text":"This was my first ramen experience and now I fear I've set the bar too high. This lunch was exquisite. I expected this to resemble pho, but it didn't even compare at all.   I ordered the spicy Tan Tan. The broth was so much richer and flavorful than I ever imagined it would be. The pork belly is so tender that it melts in your mouth. The thick noodles had a perfect texture and bite.   They only thing is my wife told me my garlic breath was horrendous when I got home. So, make sure your partner eats the same thing or make sure you're chewing gum."}
{"text":"I come here with a friend reasonably frequently. The place is always reasonably full but warm and the seating is comfortable despite people saying it's small..   I've tried both the spicy tan tan and their black garlic tonkotsu. Both are great their broths are just very flavorful and savory the tonkotsu heavily complimented by the garlic oil and the spicy tantan is just phenomenal, not too spicy but just great depth of flavor that I cannot simply pinpoint the ingredients from which the broth is made..  The thick noodles are always the way to go, filling and have a great al dente chew. The soft boiled egg is always delicious and the large but thin slices of pork are great as well."}
{"text":"Great place for quick, tasty and cheap Japanese ramen. For about $9-$10 a bowl you can't go wrong. The broth was okay but I don't consider it at a drinkable level like the one at Hokkaido Ramen Santouka which is just down a few blocks. Loved the poached egg which was done to perfection. Noodles had a great chew to it. The pork meat was pretty standard like at other ramen places. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"They hype is still going strong for this place. On a Thursday night at around 7:30pm had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated.   Got a Tonkotsu $9.60 and a Tonkotsu black $9.45. Extra noodle was $1.50. The broth tasted okay but wouldn't say its at a drinkable level. Noodles had a nice chew to it. The pork was a bit below average for me. There was a lot of fat on the pork meat I got which was not eatable. Overall, the ramen is okay.  Also tried the matcha cheese cake $4 - It had a nice flavour of matcha and was perfectly sweetened. The cake was silky smooth and tasted great. I think the cheese cake was better than the actual ramen and stole the show."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. GO.  NOW.  There is sometimes (usually) a long line up outside. The first time I went was last year freezing temperature. Waited half an hour outside with my toes freezing off. COMPLETELY worth the wait. And I'm sure everyone else in that line thought the same - why else would they wait so long?  I would definitely recommend the tonkotsu or tonkotsu black if you like more flavour. Ask for original noodles."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Ramen was great, very authentic Japanese style. They have a good array of choices and special ones like the Tomato which my friend got and it came with a huge scallop. There was a bit of a wait but that's what happens with new Japanese restaurants so it is expected. We waited about 20 -  30 mins for a table of 4 which was not so bad.  the atmosphere of the place is very nice and modern with that touch of Japanese flavor to it. The seating was very comfortable though the middle rows of seats causes 2 groups to have to share a table which could be kinda awkward."}
{"text":"This is my favourite ramen place hands down. A friend suggested Sansotei long ago and my fiancé and I have been coming here for years. There is usually a small lineup here around dinner time but the wait is reasonable for small parties.   My go-to is the spicy tan tan ramen. I've tried plenty of ramen but this remains my favourite. It is a spicy sesame flavour ramen with chashu pork, ground pork, soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots and shredded chillies. This ramen is packed with flavour and you have the option for thin or thick noodles, I suggest going with thick. They only serve a limited amount daily, I learned that the hard way on one visit, although you can't go wrong with their other choices such as the Tonkotsu Black. We also usually pick a side to accompany our ramen and our favourite is the Zangi, which is their take on Chicken Karaage. Nice, large pieces of juicy, deep fried chicken that go well with any ramen.   The service is good and friendly. The orders usually come out very quickly and the water is constantly refilled. Every time we are downtown and craving ramen, this is the place we visit. Hope they open a Mississauga location in the future."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the busiest ramen place in Toronto. I visited them on a Friday night. Like others mentioned, we also had to wait 10 mins in the cold to get seated.   I ordered a Spicy Tan Tan Ramen and it was perfect for a winter day. The ramen comes in a spicy soup base with pork belly and simple veggies. It's an instant warm-up from the freezing weather. I find their menu kind of small. It must be because they are more specialized... but I would love to have more selection.   Overall I had a great experience - convenient location, good ramen, friendly staff and prompt service. However, I probably won't return anytime soon due to the limited menu. To be honest, it wasn't anything memorable besides standing in the cold while waiting for a table..."}
{"text":"Toronto's ramen scene is intense, and this one is a real competitor!  Got the black garlic oil tonkatsu ramen. The broth was nice and rich, and had a wonderful depth to it, but tbh im not a fan of the garlic oil -it tasted burnt and left a bad aftertaste.  The chasu were nice and thick pieces which i totally appreciate, but it was not nearly as fall-apart-in-mouth as you'd get at kinton.  But the noodles is were the party is at. Seriously, it is so bouncy and soft but with the perfect firmness.   In regards to the service and lineup, the queue actually went surprisingly fast and the service was equally efficient. And while thr whole process was as quick as lightning i never felt rushed by the staff and they were always friendly.  Amazing experience overall."}
{"text":"Tonkotsu black ramen with gyoza appetizer.   Everything comes pretty quickly and sapporo is cold Options on ramen are good: soft boiled eggs, extra noodles, extra shashu  Minus 1 star because compared to other Tonkotsu ramen like ippudo it is not as tasty. But the best I had in Toronto.   Repeated experience: happy because food quality is consistent"}
{"text":"Came around noon during the week, and had to wait outside in the cold for 5-10 minutes. Pretty small inside but quick service.  Had the tonkotsu black and it was delicious. Would come here again."}
{"text":"Yay to authentic ramen in Markham!   I've been to the Sansotei location in downtown once, but I haven't gone since because there's always a huge lineup outside.  This location is perfect. The ramen is very tasty. I got the spicy tantan and I loved it. Only downfall is that during the lunch hours you can't order any sides. I could deal with that but having more options would be nice.  There's plenty of parking and the service was really good - waiters and waitresses are attentive and kind. I also noticed water and tea were being refilled at a good rate.   Make sure you get there early because the place gets packed FAST. Be prepared to wait if you're late."}
{"text":"This place has very good ramen, full stop.  Now because it has very good ramen, they are very busy as people will still line up even in the face of a snow fall to get in.  We got lucky, as in we pulled up at 5 minutes before noon on a snowy, slushy Tuesday morning and there was a line of about 10 to 15 people in front of us. Now the line did build up as we waited to be seated. The staff does what they can to accomodate. But my suggestion is that if you are on a limited time crunch, easiest thing is to get here before they open and hopefully you can get a table right away.  Price wise - it is within expectation for a ramen place; but on the higher end of the pricing scale  Service - the staff is pretty good for most part. The person taking names was a bit brusque; but when you're trying to manage a line - it is understandable. The staff is pretty good at clearing the tables and ensuring that the line of hungry noodle slurpers get a spot to eat.  Overall, a welcome addition to the ramen scene in Markham, but not the best ramen place in town."}
{"text":"First meal in Toronto = awesome way to start my trip. Went with a friend to Sansotei on a late Friday afternoon (about 2:30pmish) and we were seated right away. No lineup! Super friendly staff and really like the wood/posh but friendly look to the restaurant. We got a booth in the back which was nice and separate from the communal tables.   We both ordered the tonkotsu ramen (little less than $10 each) with original noodle size. You can get thin or thick if you prefer. Broth was delicious, milky and creamy with noodles perfect amount of chew to it. Also has two slices of pork, black fungus, and egg. YUM. Right up there with Santouka's (which I tried in Vancouver).   Get your ramen fix here people, don't ask just go!"}
{"text":"Within walking distance of the St Patrick train station and a few blocks from the Eaton Centre, this is a cozy but comfortable place to sit down after shopping and walking for a great lunch or dinner.  The Spicy Tantan has the perfect balance of spice and savory.  Unfortunately, this ramen shop is a bit stingy with the pork belly.  However, I also ordered gyoza, so I wasn't too concerned."}
{"text":"3.5 average overall.  4 stars for food, 3 for the lack of logic and reason haha.  This is even hotter and smaller than the other end of the street by Bond Place hotel.  Probably the booths in the back has something to do with this.  Their sharing seating arrangement very Asian style, 2 different pairs of strangers can share a 4 -seater, I like that as long as you don't bump into your ex.  So ordered the Tontaksu, with thick noodles, good pieces of cha sew, and black fungus, so broth is great.  Comes with a half-cooked egg so I asked server if I could get more noodles or meat in lieu of that, as my tummy doesn't sit well with the egg...  Well, you know how the story ends.  Good but not great.  Back home, we have way more toppings like roasted garlic chips, corn, etc.  Show you around :)  I do not understand since I'm saving them $  from the egg, nor am I asking for a discount...and it is not like I'm asking them to make me a new dish like some customers with food allergy issues.  And my ginger ale, was virtually gasless or non-carbonated."}
{"text":"There is always a line during lunch time, so i would recommend  people to go for diner. The place is small and not really bright, we were placed close to the kitchen so after our clothes were smelling like crazy! and it's really hot!   The menu selection was small, i was expecting some other stuffs. So we took the pork ramen and some gyozas.  The gyozas weren't really special kind of bland for the price. As for the ramen they were pretty tasty not too salty, pretty decent for the price. But i wasn't really amazed tho, maybe too much expectation? My friend didn't appreciate the fact that if you ask half of the bowl you still have to pay the same price ( He's easily upset)  i would recommend this place but don't wander on the menu, just try the ramen and that's all!"}
{"text":"Ate here today with the gf so here we go!   The place is quite small and quite compact, which I don't mind normally but sharing tables I didn't like that one bit. What if I want to act weird and go ham while eating, other people going to be weirded out as they see me so didn't like the sharing table part.  The ramen is quite good but the portion is quite small.. like smaller then usual from what I've eaten at other ramen places. The price seems the same but dang I was still hungry after and usually that's not a good sign of eating a meal.   The ramen had one egg which was quite nice and two pieces of pork belly... like two thin pieces.. like c'mon give me a couple more I'm paying $10 for so little food. Service was nice from the short experience we had. Just disappointed with the food portion for being number 1. Although I am Asian and if I pay $10 for a bowl of ramen I'd hope to get a decent size portion with lots of toppings or meat (for me at least). Especially from an Asian place too! You think they'd got you but nah! I just feel cheaped out by this place."}
{"text":"Decided to come here awhile ago! Been to the one downtown and wasn't really seeing the hype for it. Although this Markham location seems to have stepped it up with a larger space. Well at least larger then the one downtown!   The staff are quick to come to you easy to talk to, which is bless. Last time downtown after Ramen I had to get mcdee after sadly. This time however with thin noodles I kind of got somewhat full. Although I got some more meat and egg. The taste is quite good though! I grabbed the spicy tan tan and wow it was flavorfulllllllllll. Definitely a good location/ spot for a Ramen place!   I don't come here often so can't help you on packed times! Definitely would come back though!"}
{"text":"Food quality was good, but a bit on the salty side. Noodles were cooked well, and meat was alright."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot based on the reviews I've read and maybe my expectations were set a little too high but I thought overall the ramen was just pretty good. With the ramen selection in Toronto expanding, I think this place is about average. The broth is very good, and you can taste it has been cooked for hours. The egg was just the right amount of tender yolk. The pork was great. Nice and fatty and flavourful. The ramen itself was... meh. It was slightly undercooked and that cut into my overall experience. I got the thick noodles and they should have cooked it for a minute longer. It was slightly hard and chewy. My mom got the thin noodles and it was cooked just about right but there's nothing special to the noodle itself. Honestly I've had better. I'd say it's not worth the trek across town, but worth it if you're in the area and they don't make you stand outside in the freezing cold for a table."}
{"text":"For ramen I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area. Great food, friendly people!  Staff: Sometimes they take a while to get to you but they usually check in on the line-up and they make sure to try to keep everyone in an orderly fashion. When we were seated, they was quick with our order and were great in answering any questions about the menu.  Ambience: I would say this place is pretty small which probably accounts for the longer lineups. Pretty modern and sleek. Since we are close to others (we technically shared a table with others), it accounts for the noisiness of the place. So don't bring a first date here if you want to impress.  Food: The food is great. I had to the Tonkotsu Ramen and the broth was yummy. It was good that I got the extra noodles because I always feel like I don't have enough ramen when I go out to ramen places. I will say I have a hearty appetite when it comes to noodles so it's usually enough for the average person. The chashu was delicious and melted in my mouth and the egg was done well too. Sadly, they were out of gyozas because I came pretty late (after 9pm).   I'm not fond of the space and the lineups but the food was done really well.They definitely brought up the standards for ramen establishments in the area. Will definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"I had the Spicy Tan Tan and my friend had the Tonkotsu. It was good but not AMAZING compared to other very flavourful ramen places we have been to. The thin noodles we picked were a bit too chewy, the temperature of the soup wasn't as hot and steamy as other places when it came out and the broth wasn't super flavourful. Usually you can smell the delicious ramen when you receive your bowl but we didn't have the same experience here!"}
{"text":"I've come in on 2 separate occasions now and I think that it's been two different experiences.  Both times, my hunger levels were on par with each other.  The first time I went, it was about a 20 minute wait, so we went to Whole Foods, took a swirl and came back and it was our turn.  We had the tonkotsu black and it was very delicious - the broth was flavourful, the pork was tender, and the noodles were great.  We got their matcha cheesecake and maybe it's because I'm not a huge cheesecake fan but I thought it was \"okay\".    The next occasion, there was no wait time but for some reason, their broth/noodle combination changed in quality.  It was no longer as delicious.  I don't know if it was just an off day that day.    I've also had their slow cooked wings, which was...alright.  Their fried chicken is quite good and worth trying - make sure you zest it with the lemon first!  Finally, their wakame salad is worth ordering too.    Overall, I'm in between a 3 and 4 stars and since I can't give halfsies, I'm going to declare it in this review that it's a 3.5 star review."}
{"text":"It is the chain ramen restaurant newly opened in Richmond Hill.  I tried to go to their other stores three times before, never got any luck because they either too busy (people lining up on street) or close on weekends.  This one open on weekends and not too busy. We have been here three times since they opened, twice at 8:00pm and today at 5:00pm,  night time was full, today was quite empty.  The ramen is yummy consistently, good service and nice interior deco.  Soup is tasty with rich flavor, egg is cooked perfectly. If I am being picky, the meat can be a little bit softer and more flavor, it is not as good as Tohanbogu. The lady who served us gave a very happy smiling face, closed the blind for us as it was quite sunny beside the window.  Over all, This will be our regular stop for ramen for sure."}
{"text":"Food is similar to the Markham location, but this location has lots of smaller tables which was appreciated. Clean space. Fast and friendly service.   Warm and comforting noodle soup. :) We had: Fried chicken - juicy, crispy and nicely sized pieces. Well priced too. Tonkatsu Black - this is my favourite ramen broth. So rich and savory. I should always bring dental floss for such occasions though. Little black buts get stuck. Tan tan - spicy, but tasty too.  One of the washrooms was impaired but the other was fine and it wasn't busy anyway."}
{"text":"Very cool ceilings with the rope decorations.  Small groups expect to share tables. Tables are for six or eight. We ended up sharing a table with a very noisy slurper despite the restaurant being 25% full. In and out in 20 minutes (!) so not a big deal.  The opposite of Kinton where here it is the thin noodles and not the thick noodles that contain egg according to our server.  We ordered: Zanzi - little dish of fried chicken Black tonkatsu Tonkatsu ramen, sub corn for fungus Ramune  The broth was really salty but I really enjoyed it.  Definitely a repeat! :)"}
{"text":"SALTY!  I waited for the hype and lines to die down before trying this place and I'm glad I did because overall I would say it wasn't great. I got the tonkatsu black ramen with bamboo shoots and my bf got the tonkatsu ramen with extra cha shu. Tonkatsu black is basically the same as the tonkatsu but with garlic oil.   I wanted to like this place so bad but there's a few things I didn't like:   1. The broth (for both ramen) was SO SALTY. I wanted to pour my glass of water to dilute it at one point. My bf says the tonkatsu black was way saltier so I guess if it's a concern for you, try the tonkatsu ramen or a different one. The meal just left a bad taste in my mouth all day and made me super thirsty until the evening.   2. Just a personal preference but the pork was cut thicker than I would like but I'm sure it's not a problem for most people.   3. You have to pay $2 if you want tea. This was a bummer, the tea would have been nice to wash down the salt.   4. Communal tables is a cute idea but it wasn't a comfortable dining experience.    On the positives, we were greeted right away when we entered and we're given a number. The wait wasn't long and waitress who served us was helpful in making recommendations. The restaurant was pretty clean also. My recommendation for the owners is to either reduce the sodium in the broth or give candies with the bill so your customers don't leave with that MSG-coated mouth feeling. My meal wasn't BAD but don't know if I would come back."}
{"text":"And with that, I have successfully tried out the \"Big 3\": Santouka, Kinton, and Sansotei.  Sansotei's environment is a lot different than Santouka or Kinton. It's a lot quieter and the waitresses are more \"tame\" than the other two. Also, you don't get the kitchen counter where you can see the chefs making the ramen, as the kitchen is separate from the dining area. Therefore, if you're in for the show, this place will not be for you.  Out of the Big 3, this place has the best thick ramen, and I love my ramen thick and chewy. The tonkotsu ramen had just enough richness that it's not too salty, though the shoyu ramen was a little bit on the salty side for me. I'll put it in 2nd place, with Santouka taking the honours. This place also has the worst chashu of the three, but again it does make up for the excellent ramen noodles it offers. Finally, in terms of value, you don't get much in terms of noodles, but since the broth is so delicious you probably would end up finishing it. Sorry, no Kinton Bowler awards here.  Now that I've tried the Big 3, my decision to choose which ramen joint to go to would be what priorities I have that day. If I want excellent noodles or a broth I can finish, I'll certainly come here."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Hype's over, lineup isn't as bad as before, and quite frankly I noticed the early teething issues of this restaurant has been fixed.  I gave this place another shot on a Sunday evening at around 8:30pm, and there was no lineup this time around. In fact, the restaurant wasn't too full, so I was actually able to get a comfortable seat in one of the booths.  This time, I tried the tonkotsu black ramen. I contemplated adding more noodles, but decided not to in case they increased the portions. It was a good thing I didn't, because the portions were definitely higher than what I had the first time around! In fact, I was barely able to finish the noodles, and I was unable to finish the broth...two things that I managed to do easily last time around. The ramen is also just as chewy, but not as undercooked as before, so they definitely fixed that issue as well.  Service has also improved, and we were attended to the whole way. Definitely worth a visit now for those who don't like lineups!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. We ordered extra noodle extra pork but $2 for two slices of pork belly and normal amount of noodles :(( Magic Noodles is only 2 mins away walking and have way bigger bowl, better soup better noodles and much more variety of sides. Don't think we'll come back anymore"}
{"text":"Sansotei's spicy tantan ramen is my hands-down my favourite ramen in the city. (tied with the shoyu ramen from Guu Sakabar)"}
{"text":"My favourite ramen place. Only downside is that they do not serve chicken ramen which is normally less greasy than pork. I would recommend the miso black that is delicious"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and delicious. Went on a Friday night around 5 and the wait was about 10 minutes. People come in and out of there fairly quickly, so unless the line is insane, you'll probably wait about 20 min. I tried the black tonkatsu and the spicy slow cooked chicken wings. The garlic oil in the ramen is amazing, I've never tasted anything like that. The garlic taste isn't overpowering, the soup base isn't salty, and you can get the noodles thin or thick. The chicken wings on the other hand, not good. Way too soft and not spicy at all. It was more like boiled soy sauce chicken wings.   Pros: cheap, flavorful, and great service.  Cons: tiny location. You have to line up outside to get in so, I can't imagine people waiting outside during the winter."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Ramen Place in Toronto thus far! It's no fuss in-out dining. Highly recommend their tonkutsu black Ramen. Do ask for harder thin noodle for a more Al Dente experience. The tonkutsu broth is rich but not overwhelming.   Cons: do be prepared to line up on the street if the tiny eat-in area is full! (I'm sure some other better arrangement can be done to enhance the dining experience)"}
{"text":"They have great noodles, but other things are just so so. Their fried chicken are not that great. and spicy chicken wings, which I do like, lacks consistency. Sometimes the wings are too salty and sometimes they are not flavourful at all. Don't ever order drinks here, 3 dollars for half a glass of drink is insane in my mind. I have been to Asian supermarkets before and a 1 litre bottle of calpico cost less than 3 dollars. They gave me half a glass. Never ordering any drinks here anymore."}
{"text":"Been here more than a few times, and the first time I ever had the TONKOTSU BLACK I thought I was going to die.  I was like, Ramen? F*** Ramen, who the hell pays 10 dollars for instant noodles? Y'all crazy.  Probably just the commoner in me speaking. Had a few places like Ajisen (of which I'm still a fan) and I don't like Kinton.   But when I put that first spoon of TONKOTSU BLACK in my mouth, I was like DAMN FAM, WHERE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE. It makes me want to consider keeping ramen on my rotation cause it's still 10 dollars for a bowl of noodles and two little ass pieces of meat. But yeah, it'll probably change your perspective on life."}
{"text":"Solid tonkotsu ramen. Fatty as hell broth as you'd expect. Eggs are solid, decent amount of meat. I had the tonkotsu black ($9), which is a tonkotsu with black garlic oil poured into it.  The menu doesn't describe the difference between shio and shoyu ramen (they are listed with identical ingredients, so friends I went with were confused). FYI shio = salt-based broth, shoyu = soy sauce based broth.  Beer was bottled and wasn't cold enough though. They have Sapporo and Asahi Black.  Arrived at 1:45pm on a Friday and there were 4 people waiting outside. Had to wait about 25 minutes for a table for 7."}
{"text":"Good ramen shop however it is a little bit on the saltier side. Ordered Tonkatsu and Tonkatsu Black...the latter one has a stronger soil sauce taste. But I like both of them. The way I adjust the saltiness is to dilute with bit water and then works fine. They serve the food very quickly which I love. Cute restaurant eating environment too."}
{"text":"Food is great, but portion is very small. Don't go to this place hungry.  Service is great - the waitress was very friendly. Seating is comfy, but too crowded since this place is very busy."}
{"text":"The tonkotsu black ramen had great flavour and depth. The only regret was that I ordered the thin noodle as the staff recommendation and that there wasn't corn as a vegetable in my bowl."}
{"text":"The broth here is really creamy and there isn't a hint of artificial flavouring, at least I find, but it would be great if they can expand their menu.  Sure the ramen tastes very authentic but see I'm not excited to go back because, well, there isn't much else to try. There are less than 10 options in their menu."}
{"text":"Sansotei is one of the top three ramen restaurants in downtown Toronto and has held a pretty good reputation but unfortunately, the new Markham location was a disappointment. The new Markham location is not even comparable to the location in downtown Toronto. The soup base is completely off, the texture of the pork belly was not the same and the noodles were just not up to par. Sansotei Markham really needs to work things out before potentially damaging their reputation.   One good thing about this location is that there is way more seating/space compare to the one in downtown. Also, expect lineups as this restaurant has just recently opened. Currently, it is a soft opening so the hours are only from 5 pm to 11 pm and it is closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go here almost every other week!  The stock is the star of this place. I recommend the pork stock with thick noodles"}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars and more!!!! The place is beautiful for a ramen house, prices are 30% cheaper than Kenzo or Kiu and food is absolutely delicious. It tends to be overcrowded, but f you go at 5 30 instead of 6 for dinner you won't have to wait in line for a table. Staff is very young and fast, and if you sit at the bar, you can see the bustling kitchen and how those guys are working their wonders :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of ramen and only came here because some friends were going so my finance and I decided to join them.  LINE-UP We got there at around 8:20PM on Saturday and there were already 12 people in front of us waiting in the cold.  Fortunately, the line was moving quite fast and after just chilling outside for a bit (no pun intended), we were seated within 15-20 minutes.  SERVICE/ORDER Unfortunately, the thin noodles were sold out by that time so 3 of us ended up getting the Sansotei original noodles.  My fiance got the thick noodles.  We also ordered some side dishes to share and had to wave down the server for bowls (a couple of which weren't washed very well with rice still stuck on them).  :P  The server apologized and promptly gave us new bowls.  SIDES The Zangi fried chicken consisted of about 4 pieces of chicken.  It was OK, nothing special. Same with the Gyozas  RAMEN I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with Sansotei original noodles and was impressed!  The pork belly was tender.  The broth was made just right and not salty at all (which usually worries me).  I think my fiance ordered the same item except with thick noodles.  I just remember it being more yellow in colour and it tasted different but I just couldn't pin point the difference.  I definitely preferred my noodles more though.  OTHER COMMENTS One minor thing... I didn't like the fact that for $2.00, the green tea came from a tea BAG.  I was expecting tea leaves or genmaicha at least.  Then again, I'm very picky with my tea.  ;P  In any case, I definitely would like go back some time but probably won't order any sides nor drinks.  Just the ramen is good enough!"}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places in toronto. Everyone else seems to agree, since the wait time is typically very high during prime times.   Firm and tasty noodles in a smooth milky broth.   Seating is rather uncomfortable and close to neighbouring diners. Though not too much of a problem.    Will return during slow hours."}
{"text":"We popped in to have a quick warm bowl of Japanese deliciousness on a cool rainy day. And as expected, it hit the spot!    I had the Shoyu, which is a soy based broth, with thick noodles. The bamboo shoots that I am usually not a fan of, were perfectly cooked and I actually liked the subtle flavour and crisp and soft texture.  The pork slices, which are fatty, are smoky and melt in your mouth. But yes, for someone that does not usually eat anything fatty, means I have to close my eyes and chew quickly. But it is well worth it.   My wife had the spicy tan tan and really enjoyed hers as well. I tried a little and it had a spicy garlic infused flavour that warmed me up even with the little bit that I had.   From a Japanese friend, this place is about as authentic as a Japanese noodle place can be.   It is small and sometimes gets packed. But it is worth the short wait as their turnover rate is pretty quick.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the real McCoy, they got the milky style broth down. Take a pass on the soy chicken wings, very average.  The place gets busy so if dining alone, be prepared to sit with strangers. And if you can't do stairs, you can't go pee pee.  And look up towards the ceiling and admire the big rope decor's zen-like beauty."}
{"text":"Only waited 5 minutes at 9pm on a Friday night; I guess because of the snow storm. Friendly staff. I ordered the thin noodle with the tonkotsu ramen and the hub ordered the same but thick noodle and gyoza. To be honest, while it's pretty good, my preference is still Kinton. Also, the portions here are smaller, yet the price is about the same. Still worth a try!"}
{"text":"Not bad for instant noodles! But is it worth the wait?? Maybe, because it's the best ramen in Markham. We showed up at 5:15pm (we were unfortunately 15 minutes too late), the first seating had already filled the restaurant, and we were 2nd in line!!! Good thing I had already fed my daughter! We waited about 15-20 minutes and finally were seated. Their ramen is good: we ordered the tonkotsu with thick noodle, shio with thin noodle, gyoza and zangi; all were yummy (great comfort food on a cold day). But, good for Markham, in our opinion Toronto has better ramen. So, do you drive or do you wait in line? You should at least give it a try!"}
{"text":"Like it's downtown location, great ramen with delicious broth but a small location with limited and awkward seating. Awkward as in you'll be sitting next to strangers, touching elbows, and on a high stool. And the server will have to awkwardly navigate between seats to get you your food.   There's also no take out option.   The food itself was fantastic and I would like to eat here more often, but the experience of being there really sucks given the limited space. Ajisen Ramen is only a few steps away and it has better seating as well as take-out option, for about the same price. Their soup is also good, though I prefer the toppings and ramen at Sansotei.  Still, a solid food offering for very reasonable price.  3.5 stars out of 5.  Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in the city. And there's a lot of ramen in the GTA now!  Great soup base, great noodles, very rich flavour. Only problems are the line-ups. It's a small space, so you'll probably be sitting beside strangers or right by the window. Lucky folks get the table in the corner booth.  Definitely worth a visit so long as you don't mind waiting 30 mins outside in a line."}
{"text":"Was craving ramen on this cold day... being new to this city, I yelped my way over plenty of ramen restaurants and found this one with good ratings.  So I went.  Ordered the black tonkotsu ramen.  It has a garlic oil and that I believed was the black sauce mixed with the broth of the ramen.  I find that black sauce to have a bitter aftertaste.  It is unique but not really to my liking.  For me, it tainted the taste of the ramen broth.  The noodles were very good, it was firm which is the perfect texture.  The chashu was braised really well.  Over all, the ramen was ok.  I just wish the broth was more full bodied and flavorful."}
{"text":"Been here twice already and I will absolutely be coming back!   Honestly, when my friend told me it was ~$10 for a bowl of ramen, I was a bit skeptical at the quality. My first bowl of ramen at Sansotei Ramen was their Tonkotsu Ramen and it was delicious. I got some extra shiitake mushroom, as I love those haha.   I was very pleased with how fulling and flavourful the ramen was. Very excited to try the other flavours!"}
{"text":"Have been to the downtown location and visited the Markham location today. The ramen broth and noodles were up to my expectations given it is one of my favourite ramen joints. I do think dt one is better. Tried the spicy tantan today and was thankful that it was manageable considering I am not the biggest spice eater. The tonkatsu was amazing as per usual. Once again, they always have eggs done very well. I also got to try the matcha cheesecake today which was good since I love anything green tea. Overall, it was good. However, please expect for line up and wait time during lunch. I did find the staff dealing with seating a bit rude and service was just alright. For that, no four."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. We went last long weekend at 7pm for the first time, worried about their infamous lineup to get a table. We got a table in about 15 minutes- so it wasnt so bad after all!!  I'll have to say I now understand the hype. They are serious about their noodles. They were el dente and the eggs were perfectly cooked. We ordered the scallop- tomato and the tonkitsu. Both were really tasty, We just wish it came with a little more (1 scallop in my noodle!) We were also not impressed with having to pay $2 for tea."}
{"text":"I have to admit that going to a ramen place is rarely one of my top 3 choices of dishes to eat when deciding where to go for a meal. I guess I could trace it back to previous experiences of having ramen that was \"just okay\" in terms of flavour. After going to Sansotei Ramen last weekend though due to a family member's suggestion, I'm definitely more open to trying different kinds of ramen, particularly at this place!  The Miso Black ramen with thick noodles was recommended by our server and a friend. Ingredients listed in the description were tender pork (kakuni), soft boiled egg, mushrooms, green onion and roasted garlic oil. I was a bit skeptical about whether this dish would actually taste as good as I was told and I wondered why it was almost $14. I honestly didn't have high expectations but ordered it anyway. When it arrived, I noticed the cute presentation with a flower in the bowl and that the portion size was larger than I expected. After having my first taste of this dish, I tasted notes of pepper, garlic, spice, and pork - all of which complemented each other so well. It took me by surprise how flavourful and delicious it was! I really couldn't believe the amount of flavour in that dish!  My husband had the Spicy Tan Tan ramen which had a spicy sesame flavour to it. It had a soft boiled egg, some ground pork, chili peppers, and bamboo shoots. He enjoyed it but I can't really comment on it as he ate it all up.   The gyoza (pork dumplings) were flavourful and fresh tasting as well. It also came in a good portion considering it was labeled on the menu as a side dish.   Other thoughts: Servers were polite and efficient with the ordering and delivery process. The food also didn't take too long to come out - about 15 minutes if I remember right.   The space is a small one with long communal tables (clean overall) and high chairs. The space between customers is a bit tight but our group was just happy to have gotten seats, especially since it was on a Saturday.   We managed to get free parking on a nearby street. I also noticed their note on their tables about free parking for 2 hours at 500 Doris Avenue. Buzz and say you are a customer of Sansotei.  All in all, Sansotei Ramen was a great dining experience that was full of delicious food and good service. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really tasty ramen that I did not expect to get in Markham. I'm happy that they are able to bring the quality they serve downtown to uptown.   The soul base is fantastic and the noodles are cooked just right. The bowl may look small but it's actually a lot of food so don't get too eager with extra noodles or side dishes.    They have Sapporo on tap, which is a great bonus."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in Toronto. There is a reason this place has a line out the door on most evenings. The Tonkotsu Black is outrageously good each time we've come here. The amalgam of garlic infused flavors is amazing with thick creamy broth. Not overpowering nor salty. I've gotten the thin noodles each time and they are delicious. An amazingly hearty meal (especially perfect in winter time) that pairs extremely well with Japanese beer.  The waitstaff is friendly, and the atmosphere is cozy and authentic."}
{"text":"I got the tonkotsu black (roasted garlic oil) with thin noodles and it always hits the spot. I always suggest the thin noodles because it's more authentic and more flavour because of the increased surface area haha. The garlic oil just adds another level to the ramen. There's usually a long line outside during dinner so I came just after the dinner rush. The place itself isn't that big hence the line. Staff are nice!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Ramen place in Toronto. For quality and price I think you won't get any better.   My go to Ramen is the Tonkotsu Black. Very nice thick and flavorful broth, mushrooms and pork. Make sure you arrive early because this is offer on a limited basis.   A great side dish to have is the Zangi, deep fried chicken chunks. I just love how crispy and tasty it is.   Service is always great, fast and pleasant. The staff really seems to enjoy working there and their cheerfulness is contagious.   The dinning room is small but nicely decorated.   You will have a great meal for under $15."}
{"text":"4.5  Pros: Very well done ramen Service was excellent  Cons: Parking can be tough to find at times  Sansotei is my favourite place to get Ramen in the city.  So when I heard they had opened up a location literally blocks away from me, I just had to stop by!!  For a restaurant on Yonge Street, this location is pretty big.  They have a 30 seat capacity which is tremendous compared to some other noodle joints near by.  For comparison, most places in the same complex have about 10 seats total.  There are 4 sets of long cafeteria-like tables and then 2 tables that seat 4 each in the back.  For a ramen place, it's remarkable kid friendly at lunch time.  We brought our youngest in a stroller and there were also 3 or 4 other groups with children as well.  If you've been to Sansotei before, the menu you be quite familiar.  They offer everything the other locations offer.  I always order the Tonkotsu black and my GF got the regular tonkotsu this time.  The ramen safe to say, is also just as good at the downtown locations.  If I had to rank the locations, this would be slightly behind the downtown locations and ahead of the Markham location.  The broth was excellent, very rich and flavourful.  At the end, it wasn't overly salty as some ramen broths tend to be.  The noodles were very good too, a little less bite than the downtown locations but still very enjoyable. Overall, you're in for a very good bowl of ramen.  The service as with most Japanese eateries was excellent.  You're greeted with a smile from start to finish and they're excellent throughout the entire meal.  They were very helpful when we were trying to find a table that would fit our stroller.  There's a small minuscule language barrier but nothing that will deter you from coming here.    If there's any problem with this place, it lies with parking options.  Being on Yonge, they don't have parking of their own so it's basically a free for all on the streets.  Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't.  Overall, Sansotei is a very welcome addition to the neighbourhood.  I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for a good bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"3.5  Pros: Friendly service One of the few Ramen places uptown  Cons: Long wait times Not as good as downtown locations  Santosei at Yonge and Bloor is my favourite Ramen in the city.  Having one open uptown, it was only a matter of time before I gave this place a try.  It's one of the few places you can get Japanese style Ramen uptown.  The number one thing you should note about this place is to come early or expect a long wait.  We came just before 6pm and we still probably waited 40-45 minutes for a seat.  It's a very busy place and the places isn't the biggest.  Expect to share tables with others for sure.  If your here with a date or friends, it's not too bad.  If you got children with you, it can get a little tough.  When I'm at Santosei, it's always the Tonkotsu Black with extra noodle and corn.  My GF got the same thing minus the corn.  They recommend the extra noodles on the side in a separate bowl which I agree with.  If you opt for it all in the same bowl, the noodles get to soggy near the end.  The noodles come out pretty fast considering how busy they are.  We also ordered the Zangi (deep fried chicken)  Comparing this location to the Yonge and Bloor location now.  The Ramen here is good, but a step below what they make downtown.  The broth here is much more saltier than the location downtown.  The noodles just didn't have the same bite as the ones downtown.  It still is a good bowl of Ramen, just feels a little off from what I'm used to.  The Zangi also comes in little strips, not the big chunks the downtown location offers.  The service here was very good throughout our visit here.  All of them were very nice and patient despite how busy and hectic thing got.  You've got yourself a very good place to get Ramen here.  If you've been to the locations downtown though, it might leave you a bit yearning for more."}
{"text":"Had Tankatsu with thin noodles and one extra egg. The eggs are so delicious and definitely deserved visiting if you come to Toronto."}
{"text":"Wherever you have to wait 20 minutes in the rain just to get seats, the food BETTER be impressive; Sansotei Ramen in Toronto delivers on this promise.  The noodles are chewy, just the way I want them. The soup is rich and creamy. I normally order Shoyu ramen, so impressing me is harder than usual because it's not as popular as tonkotsu. I loved everything about their ramen. The pork slices were slightly charred to bring out more of the flavor and aroma, it was just amazing!"}
{"text":"Blah - Bland soup, SUPER FATTY Cha siu.   Shouldn't even be calling it a Cha siu - just call it Fei Siu (PURE FAT).   And soapy noodles.  I don't know if you know what good food is suppose to taste like if you think their broth is actually more flavourful than Santouka.   I just wrote a review for Santouka not too long ago - rated it a 3 stars, but after having went to Sansotei today, Santouka deserve more like a 4 stars.   Because we were so dissatisfied with our orders, we were still hungry , so we ordered a fried rice.  Tasted like something I could make at home.   Compared to the rice combos being served at Santouka (i.e. especially the simmered pork rice with house anise sauce), it was nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Best Ramen I have ever had.  I had the ramen with garlic oil which was flavorful but not overpowering.  The thin noodles were cooked perfectly and clumped appropriately.  Broth had a ton of flavor.  Just get there early to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"Maybe the best ramen I ever had. I was still excited about the broth even at the end. (So rare that I don't get over salted out!) Many different textures and flavor a throughout my meal (black tonkatsu). Amazing."}
{"text":"Always wanted good ramen, and I must say that this place every dish they offer tasted really good. I've tried every dish on the menu and I would get each one again, you can't go wrong. Introduced one of my friends to this place and he's been going there 3 times a weeks for the last month. The location in Markham sometimes they sit us beside strangers when the place is packed because they have these long tables, didn't see that here. Portions don't look big buts it's really filling. The katsu chicken is amazing too. My new ramen spot!"}
{"text":"I have such a bizarre relationship with Sansotei. It is my first choice place for a comforting bowl of ramen after a crappy day... But I will hardly ever recommend it.  First, the menu is tiny. Not necessarily a bad thing, but something to take note of if you like infinite choices. There's maybe 4-6 choices of ramen, and a few are similar with just an added ingredient here or there (typically black garlic oil). I personally don't mind the small menu, but I could imagine others would.  Without a doubt, I always go for the tonkotsu black ramen. I've tried others and they are decent, but this is by far the best. The broth is perfectly fatty and the garlic oil is the perfect addition.   This time around, my partner ordered the miso black ramen for the first time. It tasted pretty mediocre. Not horrible, just nothing to brag about. Other times he's ordered the spicy tantan and tomato ramen, and they were pretty interesting. Still not as good as my tonkotsu black, but fairly unique and very flavourful.   We're ordered the zangi a few times. It's alright, a decent price ($4.50), but could be a bit more flavourful. Definitely make use of your lemon wedge. Still good for the price!  The rating is as low as it is for the sole reason that there are other better options out there. I will never turn down a Sansotei date, but given the choice, I'd likely go elsewhere. Yesterdays dinner was likely the last time I'd step foot in one, because I am starting work at a new company and Sansotei is no longer 5 minutes away from my office.   The end of an era. God speed, Sansotei."}
{"text":"I just went here yesterday. Their ramen was fairly good. My table ordered tonkotsu, tonkotsu black, and tomato ramen. First place goes to the tonkotsu black because the soup tastes the best. Second goes to tomato because the slightly sour soup was very refreshing. Last goes to tonkotsu because it was more bland compared to the others. I recommend ordering thick noodles instead of thin, as they are more chewy. Overall great place and service, just thought I was getting eagle-eyed whenever I was eating."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen place in Toronto! It is also the only ramen place where I can finish all the soup and not feel gross after. I love how their noodles are al dente and how the eggs are always perfectly cooked. I usually order a Tonkotsu with thin noodles or a tomato ramen also with thin noodles.   In terms of apps, their dumplings are a must try and the karaage is good but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Dropped by on a Friday night just before 6pm and the line was starting to build. We waited outside for less than 10 minutes before we were seated by a friendly waitress.   The menu is simple- we got the original tonkotsu and the tonkotsu black (both with thin noodles). These were the best bowls of ramen we've had since our visit to Japan at the beginning of 2016. The tonkotsu broth was thick, flavorful and rich... done really well. The tonkotsu black had black garlic oil which was not for the faint of heart. You'd really have to be a garlic lover because the flavor coats your mouth and you'll taste the black garlic oil with every bite. I prefer the original tonkotsu because I find the garlic oil overpowers the broth too much.  Can't wait to come back for another bowl of ramen!!!"}
{"text":"It is quite crowded and busy,  they should definitely expand the place.  The ramen is delicioussss."}
{"text":"Researched Toronto ramen shops. This had the most reviews so I decided to try it.   Happily so. The ramen came fast. Had the tonkatsu black ramen. Thick noodles. It was better than I had imagined. Nice broth and a healthy portion of noodles.   Atmosphere is very traditional ramen house. You hear more slurping than chatting. Exactly as it should be.   5/5 would eat there again. And again. And again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious... the ramen was fresh and delicious, the Sapporo was cold and crisp. The service was basic but nothing to complain about. The place is always packed at meal time and is super small, so you will have to wait outside... prepare if it is cold out... the line gets going quickly. Also, due to how small it is, prepare for tighter quarters.  No reservations or calls ahead. They do take credit."}
{"text":"It's wonderful to have a good quality ramen house uptown in Markham. I think this place deserves overall 3.5. First things first, this location has plenty of parking but having something that isn't on the other side of the lot seems like a challenge during peak meal hours. There generally is a wait if you want to dine here during popular times, but nothing outrageous...say 30-40mins on a Friday night if you come at 7? Unlike most Asian restaurants, tables seem to have a dedicated server, since you are declined service by wandering wait staff. Yet your real server will never formally introduce themselves, exclusively bring you all the food/bill nor check on you like a mainstream establishment. I've tried most varieties of their ramen and enjoy the classic tonkatsu with thin noodles best. Most ramen are just over $10 with their recent price increase. The soup is flavourful and perfectly milky off-white in color. The noodle is the right texture not too soggy but just enough bite. The toppings aren't the star but done properly - runny half egg with pork cha siu, nothing too memorable. I didn't like their thick noodles because it reminds me of high end store bought ramen (frozen kind). I think their version of fried chicken (karaage like) needs some more work, they come out burn your hot but nothing special. Overall, I don't mind coming here for a bowl of consistent ramen every now and then, but there are plenty of good lunch/dinner options nearby for cheaper and without the wait."}
{"text":"This new location of Sansotei is quite hidden in an old plaza (where I never expected anything great to come out of it!!).  I have always been a fan of the Sansotei location at Hwy 7 & Warden but the wait times can be pretty long.. so I am super excited to have delicious ramen to close to home!  I ordered the spicy tantan ramen which was super delicious and flavourful.  The only downside is that this location does not accommodate larger parties.. their tables are mostly booths for 2-3 people... maybe a handful of tables for 4+.. but this location is quite new and it doesn't seem to get as busy as the Markham location."}
{"text":"Kinton is still the best, but the soup here is better than kenzo.  The menu here is focused on basic ramen, but the price is not cheap tho (compared to Kenzo). The price is close to Kinton, but the food in kinton is much more delicate.  Plz see my blog for more info and pictures. http://torontoparadise.blogspot.ca/2012/09/sansotei-ramen.html"}
{"text":"Went here during their \"soft open\" and really, really enjoyed it Tried the shoyu (I believe it's called) and I added shitake mushrooms, went with the thick noodles, also tried the gyoza The broth was very flavourful and it didn't have the synthetic taste some other ramen places have (definitely tasted like they make their own fresh broth with no bouillon or other things like that). The noodles has a nice bite to them and the shitake added a nice flavour as well. The egg was very tasty and perfectly cooked. The gyoza was fresh and tasty. Thin dumpling wrapper and you could tell they were freshly made.  The service was also very friendly, the servers were smiling and happy and it was a very enjoyable experience. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I like the tonkotsu ramen! right amount of salt in the soup. rich soup base. pretty filling."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite ramen place I've been to so far! They have six ramen options to choose from and with either thick or thin noodles. I ordered the spicy tantan ramen with thick noodles, which was a spicy sesame flavoured broth topped with ground pork shredded chillis one egg and a slice of pork. Usually ramen dishes  contain a crap ton of sodium so I don't usually finish the soup, I finished this one!! The broth was so full of flavour, very rich and delicious. The noodles were perfectly cooked and soaked up the broth nicely. The soft boiled egg was also so cooked well! Everything about the dish was great. Price wise it's pretty consistent with other ramen shops - the bill came to ~$11. Also got a side order of gyoza, which was quite good as well - nicely fried and crunchy. I tried my friends tonkotsu ramen and soup and that was also very good. Will come back to try that or either the miso black! Huge fan of this place!"}
{"text":"The service at the North York location was exceptional. I ordered the Tonkatsu Black. It was flavourful and not too salty. The egg was cooked to perfection. Having it with the broth was the best part of the meal. Noodles were soft but still slightly crunchy which was great. The only negative is that I wished there was more chashu. However 2 pcs seems to be standard now. All in all, I would recommend a try."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot in Markham for Ramen. I've been here a number of times and they never disappoint.  When entering the restaurant, the servers great you with enthusiasm and make you feel welcomed. Usually there is a short wait (5-10 mins) but the turnovers are quite quick; max 30 mins wait when most busy.   I have ordered the Tonkotsu, Tonkotsu Black, Shoyu and Spicy Tan Tan. From these selections I would say my favourite is the Tonkotsu Black. The Tonkotsu Black has a bit of a bitter taste which brings out the distinct garlic flavour. Each time I have come the Ramen bowls have come piping hot and fresh to order.  The noodle to choose is the thick ramen. They are chewy and perfectly cooked. I usually order extra noodles on the side (pro tip: they usually give more compared to in bowl and the noodles don't get soggy as fast). The eggs are always perfectly cooked to perfection.   Lastly the broth is rich, creamy and very tasty. The broth may be a bit heavy to some people but is perfect with the extra noodles. Each time I come here the Ramen experience is the same as the last: Amazing!  Also I normally order the Chicken Karaage or Zangi (Fried Chicken Balls $4.50). They are always served piping hot as they are fried to order. They are flavourful season pieces of dark meat chicken with a wedge of lemon on the side. These are a must try if you haven't had them already!  Overall this place is the best go to ramen spot in Markham. The Ramen is rich and intense and very filling for a cheaper meal under $15.   tl:dr: Pros: Ramen is Bomb AF           Great Service (quick and friendly)           One of the best spots in Markham           Bowls are served hot and fresh            Chicken Zangi are a must try  Cons: Wait may be a bit long during peak            May be a bit salty for some"}
{"text":"Just as delicious as the downtown Dundas location which I've been to several times. I believe they are still in their soft opening (have not announced a grand opening date). The decor is nice and bright. Oddly placed right next to a popular and family run pho place though. This time I got the spicy tan tan, which was delicious. My friends all enjoyed what they ordered. It's definitely our favourite ramen joint. I also loved how they had a black seasame crepe cake which was very tempting to order. We ordered a fried chicken appetizer which had an interesting/unique seasoning. Wasn't as crispy as some may like and its a bit greasy. Several of my friends ordered a black garlic ramen, but only one of theirs came with a lovely purple and edible orchid flower."}
{"text":"Best ramen in town! Had the tonkatsu black and the flavour was intense! Always wished to have a ramen in this neighborhood and now we got the best. Will be going there often in the future."}
{"text":"Good ramen, slightly overpriced. The restaurant is a long, narrow room with interesting mirrors as 1 wall. Lines can form for dinnertime.  Would return."}
{"text":"Out of the ashes of my beloved Cali (pho too delicious for this world) comes Sansotei, yet another ramen place. I was skeptical, but it won me over: this place is laser-focused on basic ramen, and it's very, very good at it.  SETUP/DECOR It's a deep, narrow restaurant with tightly-packed seating. There's a bench running the length of the right wall, and tables seating 6 lined up along it. It also has two 4-seat booths at the end, and one 2-seat counter at the front window. If you're coming in a group of less than 5 and don't get a booth, be prepared to share a table if it gets busy (haven't seen it that busy yet). If you have a group bigger than 6, I don't exactly know how that would work.  Decor is nice: dark, with classy looking wall-coverings and thick rope decorations suspended down the middle ceiling. Lighting is comfortable, music is generic soft j-pop played at a low volume.   SERVICE Friendly and fast. At the moment it has that new restaurant whiff of trying-hard-to-please. They also do that thing where they shout \"IRRASHAIMASE!\" when you walk in.   MENU The menu is very limited: ~5 kinds of ramen, nothing weird or original. Shoyu, Miso, Tonkotsu, Tonkotsu-shoyu, and I'm forgetting a couple. You can add extra ingredients if you like, but really that's it. There're a few appetizers (edamame, fried chicken) but really it's just ramen, and basic ramen at that. Prices are a little high ($8.50-9.50 for a bowl) and really high for beer ($6 for a small Kirin).   FOOD I've tried two of the above bowls: Tonkotsu and Miso. Generally, bowls are a little smaller than Kenzo, similar to Kinten.   Noodles are firm, but not crunchy -comparable to Kinten, with more substance than Kenzo (which are often very soft).   Pork cuts are either shoulder (Tonkotsu) or pork belly (Miso), and each piece is individually braised (see my photos for what I mean here).   Broth-wise, Tonkotsu was meaty and subtly flavourful, while Miso was rich and savoury. Finally, the eggs are firm but tender, and not so hard so that they're completely hard-boiled. The eggs also soak up a lot of the broth flavour, and are quite rich-tasting.   OPINION I've tried to be objective up to here, so let me tell you my opinion: this is the best ramen I've had in Toronto. Out of Kenzo, Kinten, Ajisen, and the various no-name places I've been to in the city, this is the best. The broth is fantastic, the noodles are perfect, the eggs are delicious, and the braised meat cuts are leagues above the boiled ones at Kenzo.  I do have some gripes. I wish the portions were bigger for the price, and that there was more meat per bowl. I also think the set-up of the restaurant could be awkward if it gets busy. I respect the choice to focus on ramen-orthodoxy, but the lack of selection could be seen as a downside (sometimes I want a heretical hot-sauce-based bowl with ground pork). Finally (and least importantly) I'm done with \"IRRASHAIMASE!\"  That said, shouting or not, this the real deal folks. I'll be back often."}
{"text":"There's always a long lineup. The staff are friendly and the ramen seems authentic. Although the menu is not extensive, it has everything you need to choose from. I usually get the one with pork broth (a bit oily, but good and expected) with thick noodles. It's pricier than what you'd find in Chinatown, but it's in a great location. I'd definitely recommend this place more than Momofoku."}
{"text":"I've finally caved into this ramen craze. Came here twice in a row this week. It's that good. This is what they offer:  Tonkotsu $9.25 Miso $9.50 Shio $8.90 Shoyo $8.90 Spicy Tantan $9.60  The first time, I ordered the Spicy Tantan without the pork belly and ground pork (I'm a Pescatarian) with thick noodles and it was divine. Noodles were done right, nice and chewy. The egg, oh that egg. Done just right with a bit of running yolk. My date had the Tonkotsu with the original noodles and it was creamy and very rich in flavour.   The second time, today,  I tried the Miso and I must say, it was just as amazing as the Spicy Tantan. The veggies that were included varies depending on your type of broth. I ordered extras of the bean sprouts and black fungus. You can add extra noodles, pork belly or veggies. My parents love their Gyoza ($4.50)  Definitely one of the better Ramen joints. I'd go again this week. Ajisen is garbage.  Tip: Less lineups later in the evening, they close at 10:00 p.m. and do try their thick noodles if you like your noodles thick and chewy."}
{"text":"I loved ramen before Sansotei, but I REALLY love it now. The black garlic oil version is out of this world. My go to place from now on."}
{"text":"I came here after reading the reviews of this ramen restaurant, and I didn't regret it. By far, the best ramen experience for me in Toronto. The place was crowded at lunch time but there was a good spot i could fit in. The service is very good, the place is clean which is difficult to achieve when you have full service capacity. The ramen was delicious, i ordered Tonkotsu, the broth was thick and on the salty side. The temperature of the broth was perfect, and the doneness of the noodles was perfect. As for the toppings it was fresh scallions, soft boiled egg, marinated cooked mushrooms and tender pork belly. The price is fair, and the portion s excellent for one person. I recommend people to visit this restaurant which definitely i will come back to to try other ramens"}
{"text":"I got off the plane in Pearson and sat in a taxi forever enjoying GTA traffic. After a quick hotel check in I basically sprint to this place hoping for amazing ramen. There was a small line but they also had a table in the middle and were seating singles (good for the lonely business guy) and I got in right away. The service is precise and prompt. My beer was cold and in front of me in seconds, the ramen came within minutes and was steaming hot. Perfect flavour balance, I like the creamy texture they have achieved in the bowl of tonkotsu black that I ordered. The noodles were firm with the right texture. I will be back every time I find myself in Toronto."}
{"text":"Happened to stop by this ramen place when we were in the area. The ramen here tasted very good. The menu was simple and the place is cozy. Loved it, would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best. Ramen. Ever.  Not much seating indoors, so you'll most likely have to spend time waiting outside in a makeshift line (expect a longer wait for big groups!!)  Most of the ramen is very affordable (around or under ~10 CAD, which is great right now if you're an American lol).  Boyfriend and I were sat down rather quickly because we were the only group of two and we even got the window seats (so we can stare at the folks in the line outside, haha yay!) Service was attentive and very friendly. Ramen came quick. I ordered the black tonkatsu and he ordered the Spicy Tantan. We ended up switching because we liked each other's orders more. Both were great though, no complaints; I just ended up loving the creamy broth of the spicy tantan A LOT. Noodles are perfectly made. Nice and chewy. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Man, I am SO happy this opened in Mississauga since Toronto is an absolute nightmare to get to and I refuse to go there again until they get there shit together. On top of that, this location might actually be better than the Toronto location. It's going to be a hard time deciding between Kinton and Sansotei since they are both nearby now."}
{"text":"The lineup to get into this place at lunch is a little crazy but it was pretty worth it. I got the tomato ramen which I've never had before and it was quite good. It wasn't as rich as the other broths which was a good thing considering it was tomato. My girlfriend got the Black Tonkatsu. It was really good but very very strong tasting, mainly because of the fungus. The Pork Belly was good, but not great, and definitely not as amazing as Kinton Ramen's Pork Belly!! The egg however was almost magically cooked to perfection. It wouldn't come apart whatsoever and yet the yolk was still somehow so liquidly soft.   I will definitely be back eventually, though my favorite Ramen still belongs to Kinton."}
{"text":"Holy moly.  This place is the real deal and I love everything about it.  This is the first place my boyfriend and I went to eat when we went on vacation in Toronto.  It was SUPER close to my hotel, and had great reviews.  On paper, it was a win-win.  In reality, it was even better.  Sansotei is a pretty small, and the seating is a little cramped.  It forces you to sit next to people, which I actually think is great.  It feels like being in Japan.    My boyfriend and I both got the spicy tan tan ramen and it. was. the. BEST.  The broth was so savory and wonderful.  It wasn't too spicy; I would have loved it just as much if it was spicier. The pork was tender and delicious.  The noodles were delicious and perfect, and the soft-boiled egg was awesome.  We seriously loved every single part about it.  Plus the people working there were super nice.  I'd go here every day if I could.  Ugh.  Seriously, it was the best way to start off our vacation and I miss it so much!"}
{"text":"Come in early! The extra $2 pork belly is worth it, I find the portion a bit bigger than the normal ones that come with the order."}
{"text":"I have been to Sansotei ramen a few times and it is a decent ramen even though I read that the owner is Chinese, which is never a good sign (AYCE sushi anyone?).  Still, as I said, they have a good ramen and on my recent visit with the temperatures sipping I went with their staple Tonkotsu Ramen.  First though, a couple of comments. They are always busy - which means even on a cold day you will stand outside - especially because it is a dark, small and narrow restaurant. The owner has recognized this and now operates three restaurants. There is an end-to-end nautical rope overhead. Hmmm... seafood? No! When the door opens the cold winter draft rushes in and... brrrrrr .. poor waitress has to jump outside all the time and hand people numbers. Pneumonia?  Back to the food, they are good but not Santouka good. On the plus side they have Tonkotsu which is rare around here. They also include an egg when everybody else charges extra for it (even though egg and ramen are like Donald Trump and stupidity - a loving eternal couple). The pork chashu is also well caramelized. Good job. Also, they give you a choice of thick or thin noodles (thick thick thick please). Chicken karaage is called zinga and is juicy.  So far so good, but the broth mostly fails. This is Tonkotsu guys. It is supposed to be pork bone soup where the bones have been dissolving in the broth for hours. I bet they do not do that. The smell (reek?) of Tonkotsu is missing and so the ramen does not have the correct depth. It is a creamy light wanna-be Tonkotsu.  Come on, guys. You know you are not advertising light Tonkotsu so give us the real thing."}
{"text":"Black. Miso. Ramen.   Extra thick noodles.  Extra chashu.   My one friendly suggestion - the broth was a bit too salty. Regardless, lovely composition overall. Would eat here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Very good ramen. Noodles were the least interesting part. The broth was off the hook. Tried Spicy TanTan it was superb. Their wings are really tender and delicious as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch in between my board exam and ordered the tonkatsu black garlic oil thick noodle ramen.  Perhaps they serve Canadian portion - the amount of noodle I got was half of any ramen I've ever gotten in America. In addition to the disappointing portion, I found the noodle a bit undercooked and the soup too salty. To make things worse - The pork slices were lukewarm and the egg was ice cold.   Even though, taste wise - it wasn't the worst but I felt forced to waste stomach room just so I wouldn't go hungry for the other half of exam."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in the city! Place is pretty small so make sure to get there before 12pm for lunch otherwise you'd be waiting in line."}
{"text":"Sansotei delivers true to its brand with another hit at CityPlace! I visited and was not surprised to see a line up out the door; however, it did move pretty quickly. The food is reasonably priced, is very tasty, and the service is great.   I had the Tonkotsu ramen which is one of their classics. With each ramen you get the choice of thick or thin noodles. The meat was a generous portion, the noodles were tender, and the egg was perfectly soft boiled. The broth was very flavourful and is made fresh daily in house from pork bone.   I also tried the Gyoza which was pan fried but also soft. Overall, quite tasty and decent value for price ($4.50 for 5)."}
{"text":"One of my top ramen places. Menu is quiet small so there's not a lot of variety, but almost every dish is up to par in terms of flavor, portion, and texture.  We ordered the Tonkotsu black ramen and the Tan Tan ramen. Ramen noodles cooked always cooked perfectly. I'm not one that likes soggy noodles or undercooked noodles, so the texture is very important to me. Soup sometimes can be a little too rich but overall amazing. The service is great, servers are always very polite and attentive.  The only negative side to this place is the size and seating arrangements. If you come at a busy time, you'd have to wait outside because there's not a lot of room inside. So if it's an extremely hot/cold day, be aware of that. The seating is a little cramped, many times I find myself accidentally elbowing the person sitting next to me - forget about private conversations too."}
{"text":"Really happy they opened one up in Markham. I never went during busy hours - I went on Friday night at around 6pm, and we only had to wait for 10 minutes before being seated (for 3 people). Then when I went on a Sunday night, I went at around 8:30 pm and there were a lot of seats.   The ramen is great here! I love that the ramen (thick noodles) are well cooked - meaning it is chewy enough and great texture. I had the black tonkatsu the first time, and then I had the soyu the second time. Both had great flavours and the soup base it just so so good, you know they have a secret recipe behind their restaurant somewhere. The only part I would say is that I wish they had more legumes/vegetables in the bowls. I also don't like that they are a japenese restaurant charging $2 per cup of tea. I mean, its basically required for one to drink tea while eating ramen, you shouldn't really charge for this.  The service is quite fast, and its pretty much what you'll find in Japan."}
{"text":"what better way to warm the bones on a chilly day than a bowl of ramen  Luckily since I'm eating by myself...I got seated pretty quick.  The place is kinda small so it will be a tight squeeze but cute decor!  I ordered the tonkatsu black with a cup of hot tea (didn't realize they charged for tea :( ). They do have the typical favors of shout and miso but  I just opted for tonkatsu since they asked me what I wanted pretty quickly.    The service here is great, but just a TAD BIT...like .05% rush.  There's always a wait so I can understand that.  My bowl came..yay!  The broth is piping hot and the soup is delish!  Although the flavor isn't as strong as most places I had in the States, it's not too bad.  I definitely didn't feel like this is a tonkatsu black...more like tonkatsu with a hint of the black garlic.  The noodles were SLIGHTLY undercooked but if you like them very boing-y then sure.  There is a slight smokey flavor to my chase which I thought was an interesting twist, it's a type of smokey that I'm not accustom to.  Overall, the ramen was good but I wasn't blown away by it..still really good though!"}
{"text":"yes, the noodle broth is amazing relative to kinton or kenzo. however, found it a bit too salty or concentrated. the noodles itself were amazing and flavourful."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good ramen place around Markham since the last one I liked closed down a fair amount of time ago.  Saosotei came up highly recommend by family and friends so I gave it a try.  Glad I went!  Sansotei has two locaitons: One downtown, and this one in Markham.  First of all: Make sure you check their hours.  They have some weird hours and they're not oddly enough, not open for lunch of the weekend.  Then, make sure you go early.  They get VERY busy really quickly.  They have fewer longer tables rather than more smaller ones so when they get busy, they may put other customers next to you.  The ramen is excellent.  I highly recommend Tonkatsu Black (pork with garlic oil) Ramen.  You also may want to consider getting the extra noodles.  Between the thin and thick noodles, I don't see a noticeable difference.  They also have a spicy flavor, tomato, normal tonkatsu and another one that I'm not remembering right now.  They're all under $10 before tax / tip so it's a price for what you get.  Service is excellent and they do bring your food 5-10 minutes after you order it so they're very quick - even if they're busy.  I highly recommend giving this place a try.  Just make sure to go early if you don't like waiting."}
{"text":"For my first visit, I ordered their tonkotsu ramen and what can I say? I love their broth! They met my expectations when it comes to the broth of the ramen. The noodles was also firm - prepared really well.   Also, I love the ambiance of the restaurant. Very modern - reminds me of Ippudo NYC. Also,upon entering the restaurant, the staff will welcome you with their japanese greeting and their genuine smile. Over-all, i loved my experience. Definitely recommending this to my friends."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place such high review. I had Shoyo ramen the soup is really salty. The guy sitting  at the same table ordered extra bowl of soup beforehand to water down the sodium. So I don't think the soup is salty in general. Food is very average. The price is $1-2 cheaper than other place probably that's why people like to go. But the portion is slightly smaller too. Overall not very impressed for the high yelp review."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen spot in North York! The shoyu broth is so rich and creamy. It comes with two pieces of pork and an egg. I will admit, I wish it came with more seaweed, but I won't complain, as the price is $10, which is much cheaper than other ramen spots. Extra pork is $2. Meaning, for $12, I am a very happy panda.   I'd also like to add that I've rolled into here 20 minutes before closing way too many times and I am always warmly greeted, seated, and never rushed. Unless food quality significantly changes, I'll continue coming back here over and over again."}
{"text":"After all the hype I finally visited on a week day during lunch. Arrived at noon and there was already a line up..crazy.  I'm not crazy for ramen (carbs!!!) in general, plus the highly concentrated msg soup base really steers me away from visiting too many ramen restaurants.    I ordered the tomato ramen purely based on the fact that there's scallop. I loved the soup base..tasted like actual ingredients. The noodles were good, but was expecting more vegetables and meat. There were probably 5 mushrooms, 1 scallop, 1 piece of meat and 2-3 chunks of tomato.   Curious to try a different ramen next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I've been waiting for so long for a good ramen place, and finally I've found one. I didn't even mind waiting in line for 20 minutes, it was that good."}
{"text":"Great little spot.. good menu and nice variety of broths. Had the Tontsuko Black Ramen which has tasty garlic oil in it. Price is right at $11.75 versus $20 at Momofuku."}
{"text":"this restaurant was really a disappointment. noodles were ok?but the soup is too salty????"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since my last review but I figure I get this going back up.    Ramen, as you've probably seen in my past reviews is something that I quite enjoy and developed a palate for it.  After being to multiple ones in the past, I can confidently say that this is pretty much the best place for ramen.  While I was there with my friend, I had stated that I honestly couldn't find any faults with this place.  I went on a Wednesday night with a friend, and it was fairly busy night-ish.  The waitress that was there to greet me said that I was required to wait and because of the small unit, I was forced to wait outside.  I kind of laughed to myself, as the weather was pretty cold and snowing, but the wait was no longer than 5 minutes.    Waitress got me a table and in I went.    The menu is simple and basic that really doesn't offer up too many variations of ramen but I figured it's done to indicate that they offer up quality items.  They have a few appetizers, one dessert and a few drinks that include sake.  I opted for Shoyu and my friend got the Shio (which I had from a previous time).  The Shoyu is absolutely delicious.  I could make this review a paragraph filled with hyperboles but it wouldn't have the content or the proper reasoning and objectivity that just makes this ramen just so DAMN good.  First off the shoyu...just....sublime.  I almost never get a Shoyu ramen at any place because it's typically salty and lacks any form of depth or complexity.  People assume that it should just taste like soy sauce and just roll with it.  But this broth had a TON of complexity while retaining it's \"Shoyu\" flavour.  I thought there was a bit of a sweetness to the broth as well the smokiness from the amazingly smoked pork belly really brought forth a lot of tastiness goodness.  I found myself slurping up that soup so quickly.  Noodles (which I ordered thick, I'm told that the thin and original aren't as good...) were perfectly al dente and had a nice bite that was complimentary with the broth.  And the pork belly...WHERE DO I START?  The pork belly just melted in your mouth and the slight charness on the pork belly gave an additional level of smokiness (not your average pork belly).  And finally the egg, an egg that still has a running yolk (perfectly cooked).  It comes to the conclusion that any other ramen place that opens in Toronto should be damn scared of this place because honestly I really can't find a place that tops this one.  Keep doing what you do best (and I'll keep coming back ;) )."}
{"text":"I'd say the food is quite an experience. Nice, dense broth and very flavourful ramen! We waited 10-20 mins for a table, but once we got one, service was fast and kind. I recommend miso black!"}
{"text":"Simple menu, good service and tasty food. The turnover is insane although it may look like there's a line you will get in fast. Ramen was a little salty but that's to be expected. The noodles were delicious and perfectly cooked. Affordable and quick. Will return."}
{"text":"I already knew Sansotei from its location in Ottawa, and really enjoyed it back then. We went there on a Thursday night, a group of 4, around 6-6:30, and waited in line for maybe 20 minutes.   Once inside the restaurant, you are served quite quickly, which I cannot complain about, but the moment you finish your soup, they come by and pick it up and leave the bill, which I understand there is a line-up and they want to serve the next customer, but we felt a bit rushed... this is why I cannot give it a 5.   I love the fact that you can choose between thin or thick noodles (i prefer thick). They do not have a vegetarian option."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to this ramen place, read reviews on yelp and thought i would give a go. The wait wasn't too long maybe 10-20 mins but once you say down and ordered the food came very fast. The food was really good, and the staff were super nice. Only downfall is the tables are set up weird if you're a table of 2-4 you end up sitting with strangers. Overall would recommend to other people and be back again!"}
{"text":"People are not exaggerating by saying this is the best in town. The soup base is good, the gyoza is REALLY GOOD (wrap is thin while the stuffing is seasoned perfectly). I know there are people who complain about the black garlic oil. I like it. I guess if you are not a fan of garlic....I mean you have to go beyond \"I'm okay with garlic\". If you are like me so love garlic, you will love that extra touch. Now, if only the line is not so long...."}
{"text":"The past week I wandered around the whole Toronto and randomly trying out places I happened to be hungry around. But this place will get me back for sure. I got the tonkotsu black. It was such a delicious bowl of ramen. The thin noodles were done perfectly. The garlic is too string, not sure what they use. But I didn't mind, just had to careful not to breath hard on others for the next hour. Definitely going back next week when I have to go back to that area."}
{"text":"Ramen is generally considered cheap noodles. Sansotei achieves this price-wise, but brings about a dimension of flavour that rivals a ramen shop I had at the base of Mt. Fuji in Japan.  I only seek the best, so I'll only compare against the other above average ramen shops in Toronto (aka not Kenzo or other watered down places).  Like dedicated professional ramen shops, Sansotei has just a few soup bases (Miso, Shoyu, Black Garlic soup etc.).  But you can really taste the creamy and TIME required to create their soup base; among the other heavy-hitters: Kinton, Touhenboku, Santouka, I recall Sansotei's soup base being the only one I finished.  Sansotei's strength also lies in the quality of the meat, which I find to be generally more consistent than Santouka's in having good amounts of fat and lean meat (rivaled only by Kinton by my tastes).  When mixed with the creamy broth, the tender result is what turns this \"cheap\" ramen shop into a worthy competitor even, I would say, by Japanese standards.  Oh and Japanese exchange students often frequent here, and the waitresses love it when you speak Japanese to them.  Only downside is its popularity often draws long lines, so prepare a good 30min wait to taste the quality that attracts the Japanese themselves!"}
{"text":"Came around 6PM on a Tuesday night. Managed to get lucky and be seated minutes after arriving since more customers arrived after and crowds were building.   The seating arrangements are somewhat odd as they have tables more suited for larger groups, as opposed to our group of two. Their decor is almost nautical with the ropes on the ceilings but it still holds a modern feel.   A friend ordered a normal Tonkotsu with thin noodles, and I had the Tonkotsu black with thick noodles. The bowls came pretty quickly and I was quite surprised by the smaller than anticipated portions. For me, I don't eat too much so that was great but others might not find it filling enough.   The broth was delicious but towards the end, I found the flavour slightly too overpowering. The noodles were chewy and paired well with the broth and the toppings in the ramen.   Having tried a few different locations for ramen, I have to admit this place is good but not the best that I've had (for my personal preferences in taste at least) but it's accessibility definitely is great!   Would I come here again? Yep! But it's not one of my top choices."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about the downtown location of this noodlehouse, but happened to be near the Markham location and stopped by for an early dinner.   Service: 5/5  I was seated fairly quickly, right in front of the bar and cash, with a great ear for the staff's varying conversations.   Though it was clear they were training new staff, I want to commend the whole team for being involved with mentoring their new teammates.   The service was top notch. My order was taken quickly, drinks served within a few seconds, and the food was served surprisingly fast given they had a pair of busy tables. Staff were polite and attentive.   Food: 4.7/5  The meal I ordered was the spicy tantan. The flavour of the broth was excellent, though not as spicy as I would have liked (take that with a grain of salt, as I have a very threshold for spice), and I can see why it's one of the most popular. Nice sized bowl, fair quantity of meat, though I've seen some places that are more generous. Both the ground pork and pork belly tasted good, though the pork belly was a touch overdone.   All in all a charming dinner experience.  Overall rating: 4.85/5  Will definitely come back with friends!"}
{"text":"The Tonkotsu Black is INCREDIBLE! The broth is probably the most flavourful I've ever had, along with being rich and creamy. The noodles are delectable, the toppings are all well done, and it's probably one of the cheapest 5-star meals I've had in Downtown Toronto.   Sansotei is one of my new favourite spots!"}
{"text":"The ramen here is amazing, and give a good balance between the meat to ramen ratio. Service is also very fast and they have very nice staff."}
{"text":"This review is not about the food, it's about the sheer disappointment of going to this place and it was SOLD OUT at 8pm on a Friday. That is life when living in Toronto but I did want to warn others that if you are thinking of going, have a look before you park.  And then Kinton is close by but a crazy 1h wait. Just be prepared."}
{"text":"the lines are long during dinner time but food and service is great. my favourite spot to come back to . The amount of meat and the egg that comes with each bowl is a bonus ."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends and each of us had something different so we could try out their different broths. I had the Misoblack the broth was on the sweet side and to be extremely honestly I was disappointed. The reason why I'm giving them a 4 star is because of the other dishes I tried plus they had some of our orders mixed up but they took full accountability for it and corrected it ASAP. So here is what I'd recommend getting... the spicy tantan, tonkotsu and tonkotsu black. All these dishes were flavourful and did not disappoint!if you're wondering where it is in square one it's at entrance #9"}
{"text":"This is my favourite ramen place in all of Toronto. I've sampled so many ramen bars and restaurants but this one made the most impact on me. I like their thin noodles most and the egg halves+bamboo shoot combination is my favourite. The only bad thing I have to say is if you want tea with your meal, it's a few extra dollars more. However, their instant green tea bags make some awesome tea so I can't really complain about that either.. haa..."}
{"text":"THIS RAMEN. IS THE BEST RAMEN.   After a long trip to Niagara Falls, we were hungry and we were craving a delicious meal on a cold day.  We were looking around and this place caught our eye.  We were more than pleasantly surprised by this hidden gem.  I got the Shoyu Ramen and it was creamy and the perfect amount of saltiness.  I couldn't stop eating and would have loved for seconds.  We were sat really quickly and service was also super quick.  Staff was super friendly and they do have washrooms available.  I am just really sad I live in California and do not know when I can come here again!"}
{"text":"Loved the ramen with black garlic oil.  My family had four different ramens and that was my favorite. Hmm, just a bit too salty. I would like to be able to drink down my broth but too salty. Maybe tad too thick in consistency. Maybe been in pot for too long and became too concentrated.  Thin out without diluting the flavor and less salt."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. Quite enjoyed our meal here even though what I had wanted to order wasn't available (spicy). Got to try the TONKOTSU BLACK. It was nice and tasty. Thick noodles was definitely the way to go. It was chewy and I can keep eating this...especially with the MSG soup. The struggle for sodium is real.  Came at a busy time and had to wait about 15-20 mins or so. It was obviously a eat, pay and leave type place. Service was fast (our food came within a few mins) and the staff are quite nice. Would probably be back again. I wanted to try this dt but the line up was definitely not worth it especially out in the cold."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for ramen in downtown. The quality is very comparable to Santouka, but without the crazy line up. Sometimes there's a wait, but usually within 10-15 minutes. They have 2 types of noodle you can choose, thin straight white noodle or thick wavy yellow noodle. They are both equality good. Service or prompt and friendly. And prices are more reasonable than other competitors."}
{"text":"Ramen was good, but don't expect super rich. The service was just ok. I came in with a suitcase as I was waiting for my airbnb and was seated in the back. Midway through my meal an employee came by and was using the other side of my table to count papers and sign paperwork. ???? Umm...I'm traveling, not homeless - go use an empty table, doofus! Didn't enjoy the (white?) soft drink that's on the menu. Not too tasty and don't recommend as a novelty. Wouldn't return again."}
{"text":"Toronto has quite a lot of ramen options and this place is one of the best ones.   We ordered two dishes: The Tonkostu black is really good but a bit salty. The spicy tan tan apparently is only offered in limited qualities per day, but we managed to order it and it was really good. I actually liked it more than the Tonkotsu black so I would highly recommend trying it. Overall the broth and noodles are very delicious so I think any dish you order would be good.   This place is pretty busy, we went around 6pm on a workday and it was already full. We only waited about 10 mins for a seat though."}
{"text":"Really really really like their ramen! In fact I'm craving it right now and it's 2am. I really like the thick broth that they serve and since it's so flavourful. The nooodles are typical ramen noodles minimal bounce. The service is quick so you can expect to go in and out within 30 minutes or so. Would go again"}
{"text":"Sometimes when I couldn't think of what to eat, I will prob just come to Sansotei and have a quick ramen. Before I came here almost every week cuz I personally love the tomato ramen the best. HOWEVER, they recently changed the scallop into jumbo shrimp.. why?? First, the shrimp had no flavor, second the texture of the shrimp was chalky and mushy which means IS NOT EVEN FRESH! They have also raised the price again (from $8.xx to $11.xx now) but the quality of the food decreased. Very disappointed.."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen, very flavourful, not too salty... And reasonably priced. It's a small restaurant, so seating is limited. Come early, otherwise you will be waiting on the cold!"}
{"text":"Good food. Excellent service and quality of food.  Lost a star due to it feeling like a sauna! Otherwise the food lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"I haven't had the chance of trying Sansotei downtown so this is a new gem for me in Markham. Located in downtown Markham, this is definitely my uptown ramen place to go to now!  Visited here on a Tuesday around 7:30 pm and it was pretty busy. Lineup went out the door and continued to build while we were there. We waited for about 15 minutes before being seated which was not bad.  Service was fairly quick. We ordered Gyoza as appetizers. These were fried nicely but a bit too oily.   For ramen, you have the choice of thick or thin noodles. This will be a matter of preference but I liked the thick noodles. The Tonkatsu Black soup was delicious. It had a nice smoky pork bone taste and I couldn't stop drinking it after I finished my ramen. The pork belly served in the ramen was also very tender and tasted great.   Overall it was a great experience and I'm glad to see one of the popular downtown ramen places in Markham!"}
{"text":"This place is packed even when we got there at around 6 there was a short line, but before we went and after that there was a really long line going outside the door. So we're lucky to get in at a good time. The service was really good, considering they had a TON of staff (waiters, waitresses and cooks). They kept us up to date where we were in line and our ETA to our table which was pretty great. Sat down in around 10 minutes.  The menu is simple, only serving basically ramen, dessert and a bit of alcohol. The ramen portions are just enough to fill you and aren't the biggest sizes ever, but you can pay more to increase the portions or get add-ons. I had the Shoyu ramen, which is a soy-based soup base which I feel is different and interesting to the standard miso soup bases. The boiled egg was cooked perfectly so the yolk wasn't cooked too well done so it was pretty smooth. The pork was some what over cooked but making it border line not soft enough to eat. Noodles were cooked well too. This dish cost $9.50.  Not sure if I'd go back to this location because I don't think it's worth the line right now. I enjoyed the ramen and would come back again when the hype for this place dies down. But since there are not that many ramen places in Markham, it's great to have at least one more option."}
{"text":"I have been to the Sansotei downtown along Dundas St W and was a big fan! So I decided to give it another try as soon as I found out they opened one in Markham.  To my disappointment, it was borderline mediocre. The portions were small and they were stingy on the amount of ingredients they give out. I ordered the Spicy Tantan and I only received one slice of pork belly. It's also pretty ridiculous that they charge $2 if you want an extra slice. I'm aware that pork bellies' price have been rising, but it still does not justify the $2/slice imo. I asked the waiter how many slices they usually give and they said 2 slices max for the other ramen, and only 1 slice for spicy tantan and the tomato ramen.   As for the spicy tantan, the taste of the broth was there but it was too salty for my liking. The portions were small and I was not satisfied at the end of my meal. I paid about $11-$12 when the bill came. Not worth it in my opinion considering on how little ingredients they provide keeping in mind that they are cheap ingredients, they are considered basic produce. On top of that, they refused to give out better portions of those inexpensive ingredients.   I probably wouldn't pay this place another visit."}
{"text":"After being disappointed by horrible staff service by kinton, was reluctant to try a similar place but gave it a go.   I had the tonkotsu with black garlic oil and it was delicious. The rich broth left me wanting to order more noodles but the porportions were sufficient even without.   Pricewise (10$) was decent. Had to wait around 30 minutes for a table of 5 at 7pm on a Thursday, but the hostess was very attentive and kept coming to check up on us.   The menu could use some work, somewhat limited in choices (1 small sheet) and doesn't describe the difference between each broths, only lists the ingredients. Otherwise I enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"It is one of the best chain Ramen restaurant in the world! It is also the best I ever tried in north america. Much better than ippudo New York even ippudo in Japan.  For those big chains I only prefer ichiran ramen over sansotei. The soup is thick and authentic. The only problem is the pork in north america has a weird taste that is different from the one I had in Japan and China. But it is a very very good ramen restaurant that worth trying and very cheap(Only 9CAD for my black pork soup ramen)."}
{"text":"Great ramen. Arguably the best ramen joint in Toronto. If you want something with a stronger flavour, try the Tonkotsu Garlic. If you want something more spicy, try to TanTan!"}
{"text":"Overall, I liked it lol.  The Tonkotsu Black with the garlic oil was delish! And yes, get the thick noodles! The green tea cheesecake is also a must order :) I thought it would be a softer cheesecake but surprisingly, it was as dense as a NY styled cheesecake! So creamy and good.  To be honest, I don't know much about ramen... my friends can get quite obsessed with ramen AND quite upset when ramen is not done a certain way. Ex. the creaminess of the soup base, the chewiness of the noodles, the fattiness of the cha siu (pork belly), the variety of the add ons (one friend is crazy about corn and another needs like 3 eggs lmao!)  To address all the cons from other Yelpers:  - No thumb stuck in my soup when they carried out the bowl (yay!) - The \"ramen stock atmosphere\" (lmao!) tasted flavourful... had 2 large juicy slices of pork belly!! - Waitresses were very on top of things - A pitcher of Sapporo was excellent with the ramen (to quench your thirst if it makes you too thirsty) - Not much of a wait time on Tuesday night around 8pm  Yes, I'd come back! Welcome to my neighbourhood, Sansotei :D"}
{"text":"Probably the best ramen in Markham! We always get the Tonkatsu Black with thick noodles. It has always been consistent. The gyoza are nothing spectacular. Service has always been great. You order and quickly get your food.   However, the restaurant mainly has booths so you may share a booth with other guests. It gets really crowded during peak lunch and dinner times. So expect a wait when you get to the doors! Also make sure you double check open hours, there were times we went and forgot about they were closed from 2:30-5pm."}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy day around 8 pm. The hostess told me it would be a twenty minute wait but I only had to wait 10 minutes which was a delight. Got seated and looked over the menu. Ordered the tonkatsu ramen , deep fried chicken and the spicy tan tan . For the ramen they give you options of thick or thin noodle. In my opinion I would go for the thick. The ramen was rich in flavor and the serving was just right. There are options for you to add extra noodles / pork belly etc with 1-3$ charges for each item. I didn't really like the deep fried chicken . But the service and seating was comfortable. They accept cash/credit/interac. They don't take reservations and only open for dinner time after 5 pm. I would recommend coming at 8:30-9pm since it's less busy and you will get seated quicker !"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite ramen restaurant in Toronto. Everything together, the broth, the noodles, the chasu and the garnishes makes the experience unforgettable.   I always opt for either the miso black or tonkatsu black. I just can't get enough of the garlic oil. Their zangi is also super delicious and pairs well with a hot bowl of ramen.   Cannot stop thinking about the ramen here. MUST GO!"}
{"text":"This review is solely on food , there was no real service.  Anyway ordered the black ramen, and man it was delicious. Garlicy broth, pork was tender and succulent. Ofcourse i ordered extra pork too! The egg was beautifully creamy texture!  Ordered the gyoza and the fried chicken and both were disappointing, nothing worth looking forward to there. Just grab the ramen cuz they are so good!"}
{"text":"Visited Toronto for the weekend and I must say Sansotei is the crack spot. I used to live in Japan when I was really young (dad was in the airforce); just a sip of my husband's shiyo broth threw me back to my childhood. Wish I had gotten the thick noodles instead of the thin looking back, and wish I had eaten ramen every day that I was there. I got the tonkatsu black ramen, my mouth is still watering over it. At $10 CAD (which is $7.50 US here)- it's the right price and the right look. Especially considering that gentrified Korean-owned \"ramen\" is $13+ USD a bowl here. The girls working at Sansotei are super sweet / cute too."}
{"text":"Hot, delicious, salty ramen with a rich broth. I think that is all you are looking for in a ramen?"}
{"text":"Wednesday lunchtime for a sister date. My sister has been raving about this place so much that I caved and came to try. It is a small little establishment so we shared a table with three ladies. The service was fantastic, very prompt and informative.   We both had ordered the tonkostu with thin noodles and zangi as a side. The only reason I had this particular ramen was because THIS was the reason why my sister wanted this place in particular. I was expecting to be blown out of the water with this ramen dish. However I found it to be just -- okay. The broth wasn't as flavourful as I had thought it was going to be. Not that it wasn't good, I was just expecting more spices and flavour. I am not big on eggs in my soups (I know I am not really traditional when it comes to what people enjoy in their dish) so the fact that it was already cut in half wasn't something that I had particularly enjoyed. The zangi dish was fresh and juicy I did really enjoy that.   Overall this establishment as a whole was great! However in my own opinion, would I come here over the other ramen spots I go to? Probably not, but again everyone has different taste and preferences. If my sister wanted to come back because she is having a craving absolutely, perhaps then I will try the Shoyu and request there be no egg inputted in my soup."}
{"text":"Their ramen is too salty, too little and lack of flavour"}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to try this place with two friends.   Space is small, so there is usually a line. My group waited about 5-10mins and was seated. Menu was smaller than I expected and the prices were reasonable.   The ramen came in fairly large bowls and was sizzling hot! Just the way I like it!   Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like spicy tantan, tonkotsu, and miso ramen."}
{"text":"This is probably the best ramen in the Markham area. However, waitresses are usually very busy during lunch time thus affecting the overall customer service. Last time we went there, the waitress forgot to punch a side dumpling order and at the end we decided on cancelling. The noodles are tasty and very flavourful. Although the portions are a bit smaller for a regular guy to eat there. I LEFT HUNGRY."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ramen I've had in my life. I had the black spicy miso ramen. Wow.  WOW. So flavorful (although not spicy at all). Everything from the broth to the pork belly was phenomenal.  Service was great, also had gyoza which was just so so, but you're there for the ramen, right?   A must if you're a ramen lover."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday afternoon at 1pm. Waited 20 mins before getting in. If you come with 2 people, you'll get in faster (there was a big group of 5 who waited way longer than us because they had trouble seating 5 people together). They sat us in the two stools by the door facing Dundas St. W. We came in January, and so it was cold whenever someone opened the door.  Food: EXCELLENT. SO GOOD. I had the Shoyu with thick noodles. There were a fair number of bamboo shoots (yay!) and MAN the egg was SO GOOD. The yolk was bleeding into the hot broth and mixing with the thick, chewy noodles. He had the Tonkotsu Black with thick noodles. I had a taste and my verdict is that the Tonkotsu Black's broth is better than that of the Shoyu.  Didn't have any sides or desserts, a bowl of ramen was more than enough for a hearty meal.  Washroom: In the basement, kind of dirty tbh. I'm not a fan of dark, dimly-lit washrooms, and this one was no exception. This would be the only con of Sansotei."}
{"text":"First off all, I don't like ramen, I have even tried it in Japan, but I just get over how greasy the soup is and the noodles have a strange after taste... usually I just stop eating after the first few bites.  BUT THIS PLACE is the only place I can ever finish my food in the bowl. This is my second visit to this place, which is very rare for me to crave for ramen after a trip to London, Ontario. I came to this place straight from the Greyhound Station, it was around 2:30pm... a little bit after the rush hour so I don't have to suffer from the line up, I got seated right away.  I ordered Tonkotsu Ramen with extra pork belly... after 3 hours on the Greyhound bus and have been craving for 2 days... the wait was totally worth it.  If anyone ask me about ramen, there's no place other than THIS. :)"}
{"text":"the only ramen place i go to other than kinton ramen. i usually order the tonkutso black and it's very delicious and flavourful. i especially love the egg bc the yolk melts in your mouth. the meat is also good but a bit oily. service is pretty good as well. recently started to order the gyoza too and it's pretty good but it takes 10-15 mins to make.   funny story when we got our bill and was paying with the machine the server was cleaning our table and taking our bowls but my boyfriend was not done eating but she already stacked the bowls... lol i guess she could've asked us if we were done before taking the bowl cuz there was still a good chunk of noodles left. oh well but my bf said give 4 stars cuz of this experience lol."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch thanks to fellow Yelpers!  This is a hidden gem tucked somewhere near Eaton Center and beginning of Chinatown.   Place is small and the menu is limited but boy the ramen and soup was delish!  I went for the first one on the menu Tonkotsu with thin noodles as well as the chicken zangi (fried chicken pieces).  The broth was salty but not overly salty like most ramen houses.  You get 2 large pork belly slices which was not too fatty nor lean.  The egg was cooked just right.  I gobbled it up quickly and chased it down with an Ashai Black.   The chicken pieces was nicely battered and not oily at all.  It was good enough to share for 3.  Servers are all Japanese, quick and attentive.  Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in NorthYork . Highly recommend it. Give it a try folks. (Psst... 1000% better than the so-called momofuku)"}
{"text":"Really delicious ramen. I enjoyed the ambiance and service too. Sometimes ramen places can be really crowded and uncomfortable but this one felt relaxed and you had your own space to enjoy.  Would definitely come back. It hit the spot on a cold and rainy day. Had their Tonkostu ramen, the pork was soft and the borth very flavourful."}
{"text":"Really glad the Yonge and Finch location is consistent with the downtown ones in terms of quality and service. Still hands down my favourite ramen place/chain for a good yummy bowl of Tonkotsu ramen.  Tonkotsu black ramen with extra egg and chasiu for the win!!"}
{"text":"This is always my goto spot for lunch. Quick and tasty. The decor is pleasing on the eyes. Usually pretty busy and long waits. Especially if more than 2 in your party. The good thing is that they have the bar section. So if it's a table for one. It's a quick way to get your calories on. And in a tasty way.  And f they haven't sold out yet for the evening. Always order the slow cooked wings. D lish!"}
{"text":"Very delicious ramen place especially on a cold night. Had the tonkatsu black with extra noodles: filling n yummy! Will definitely be back! The only con i'd say is that its small/cramped up. Once its full you'd need to wait outside (sucks when its cold)."}
{"text":"I have one favorite Ramen place in the world (Ramen Dojo in San Mateo, CA), and everywhere I go, I compare it to it. When I read another review for Sansotei that claimed that it was even better than my favorite... well, gauntlet thrown! I had to try it.  This particular location of Sansotei is right on Dundas Street. Hard to miss, considering how lively everything is around here. It's also really close to practically everything, including Chinatown. The location, however, is very small. It's like a really long rectangular room with mirrors on one side to make it seem bigger than it really is. Even going to the bathroom can be tricky because the door swings into diners and people who may be walking down the aisle (like an airplane). Since it's so small, it also means that it's pretty hard to accommodate kids. I had brought my son, and that made things a bit cramped since without a high chair, he moves around a lot. But no matter - I was not to be deterred!  I ordered the Tonkatsu black ramen since it was the closest match to the black garlic tonkatsu that I so enjoy. We also got the gyoza as a side. The food came out quickly, which was good for the customers since there was a long line outside and it was raining! Overall, I enjoyed the ramen very much. The noodles were the perfect texture and quite possibly the best part of the meal. The broth taste was lighter and more subtle than I think would be ideal, but still very tasty. You really can't go wrong with black garlic tonkatsu. The meat was tender and fell apart in my mouth. The gyoza were excellent, with just the right crisp and flavor. I really enjoyed the soft-boiled egg. It did, however, have a piece of egg shell in it.  So what's the verdict? As much as I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, my mind still does wander back to San Mateo. However, if I'm in Toronto again, I'll be sure to find myself back at Sansotei for another great meal."}
{"text":"The broth (black tonkotsu is best) is awesome, and love the chewy-ness of their noodles.   Only wish they have more meat."}
{"text":"*DON'T GO HERE IF YOU'RE VEGETARIAN*  Unfortunately, all the broths are made with pork. They seemed very surprised by my question so are there not many vegetarians (and muslims also!) in Toronto?   They didn't really have anything else on the menu so I just got rice and a few of the veggies and did a little DIY on the dinner table. My DIY ended up costing me $15.. lol..   The service had some serious language barriers, though they were really sweet. I wish they brought out all the sauces at once instead of each of us having to individually ask and make it more annoying for them too.   It is a small spot, expect a wait - and outside, but our wait for table for 7 was only 15 min."}
{"text":"If your looking for a place that serves good ole feel good noodle soup this is one of them places that offers the better ones. People , it's not a hype. The lines were there when this place first opened , it's still there Saturday night at 6PM.  Proof that this place serves quality.  I brought my mom here for a night out and we lined up for about 15 minutes (we were priority #12). Easier and quicker to get seated when you're in 2s . Service is very efficient & professional. They don't rush you to finish your meal however this just isn't a place where you chit chat. It just doesn't have that kind of vibe. More of you sit, you eat and you call for chit - vibe.  Now dont get me wrong, if your expecting your mind to be blown or taste buds to erupt - please don't. Lower your expectations by notches . After all folks you're here for Ramen. Simple good flavour Ramen. I find that the flavour and texture of their soup base to be just right. Smooth, creamy with the right amount of salty.  Most importantly, it does not have that distinct (almost like ammonia, I think from the bamboo shoots) smell that I get from other Ramen places which I shall not name.  I had ordered the thin ramen and I liked it , it had just the right bite.  The menu is very limited, it's only one card equal to the size of your bill tray. Almost all of the ramen tastes good, I recently ordered the Black Miso.  It had black garlic oil which brought fragrance to the Miso base soup, mushrooms soaked in something sweet I believe to break the salty of the soup and the thick slices of meat on the dish.   The taste was a first for me and a bit confusing. My mother dearest had the Spicy Tantan - tomato based soup which I had the delight of tasting. I loved it, it had just the right amount of heat for me that I still managed to \"taste\" the soup's flavours. (Sighh! dont mother know best). We also ordered the Slow Cooked Spicy Chicken Wings. Nothing fancy - its like your soy sauce stewed chicken wings with some heat. For some reason I liked it so much and still think about it now. Until my next visit."}
{"text":"Had the tonkotsu ramen with extra tonkatsu, and everything about it was wonderful. I come from Vancouver where the ramen scene is nice, but this just blew all of those places out of the water. It's not too rich or salty that you can't finish it, the noodles are cooked perfectly, the egg was delicious, and the tonkotsu could have been more flavourful but overall I have no complaints. The service was also extremely fast and friendly and there was no line when I went at 4PM. Will definitely be back when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"It was alright. $10 for a bowl. Got the shoyu which was decent. I was expecting alot more. I still prefer kinton. No dinner deals or anything.   Gets busy during dinner time."}
{"text":"Really nice new place. Service is always great, the people working there seem like they all have a stake in the restaurants success. The ramen is really good, we've tried the tonkatsu and the black garlic tonkatsu and the spicy ramen and they're all yummy, all the appetizers are delicious as well, I think we've tried all of them and would especially recommend the karaage, the wings and the beef don bowl. Always a line-up but it goes fast!"}
{"text":"Being from NY and having tasted ippudo and toto, sansotei ramen was an enjoyable dining experience. Great ramen with one of the best runny eggs I ever had."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and decor, though the place is a bit small and easy to miss. Ordered the Tonkotsu (their most popular ramen) and it was delicious. Creamy broth + tender pork belly + egg + thin noodles for $10. The portion size was good for me but it could have used more noodles.   You can choose between thin and thick noodles, and there's also the option to add more noodles, egg, or other ingredients for a few extra dollars. The service was  nice and \"authentic\"; most of the waitresses couldn't speak English very well but they were very professional and friendly. Will return!"}
{"text":"Long line up and wait time but service was great.  Tomo, our server was courteous and helpful even though the restaurant was very busy.  The ramen was good but didn't seem as good as the DT location.  The soup broth itself was warm but didn't seem hot enough and the soft boiled egg was actually a bit cold in the middle (pre made).  I would go again for sure but won't line up next time."}
{"text":"Every time I come, I'm greeted right away with the whole staffing team and immediately seated if there are seats.   Their food comes super fast so if you're looking to eat with in a 30 minute time span, you've come to the right place.  All their ramens are delicious. I've tried pretty much every one of them. Just remember to drink water :)  Try the gyoza. It's always my go to :)"}
{"text":"Best ramen on the block. Sansotei never skimps on the quality of their broth - every slurp is rich, creamy, tasty. The noodles are usually well cooked. My personal recommendations are the most expensive ramens: the Tonkotsu Black and the Miso Black. Mmmmm. You will not regret ordering. The second is even more photogenic and garnished with a flower. Chashu pork is sliced thinner than other ramen restaurants but packed with taste.  The thing about this location compared to other locations I've been to is that the space is super cramped and the service slumps. Unless you're fortunate enough to score 1 of 2 booths in the back, you'll be sat at the same table as other guests with your belongings touching if you have frumpy bags or coats. Their lunch and dinner service is BUSY - meaning you'll be asked to stand outside the store in a line without a number (do not dare to leave the line) for between 5-25 minutes, which is long enough for me to say screw it and find someplace else to eat. The servers are professional but you can tell they're constantly on fast-paced mode - they welcome guests and thank them as they leave but from what I've experienced, monotony, passively, and without eye contact. They also rush to give you your bill. No need to ask, they'll hit you with \"together or separate?\" as soon as you finish and they clear your plate. The food is great, unfortunately not the right place to dine comfortably during meal times."}
{"text":"One of my most memorable ramen experiences. Randomly found this place- was amazed, looked at reviews and realized it was very popular.   I added everything i could. Noodles, fungus, egg. Made for a huge bowl and prices were great.   I will come back!"}
{"text":"To all the 1 and 2 star reviews claiming how bad it is compared to downtown: very unnecessary!   First of all, how do you define good ramen and second, do not give a blanket review based on one dish youve had. That is not reviewing a restaurant. Maybe a fish but not a restaurant. Also on a side note, its grand opening. Expect to wait a little while.   For all others, Sansotei is absolutely one of Toronto's best spots (along with other names like santouka, kenzo and kinton) and now we have a great comparable location here! My tonkotsu broth was amazing and definitely not overly salty for ramen standards as some have claimed.   With extra noodles ($1.50) the dish turned out to be very filling. In, total $9.60 for the ramen dish and $1.50 for extra noodles came out to less than $13.00 for a great meal. Ill be back here."}
{"text":"This place had a great combination of great food and reasonable prices.  I took my daughter there on our trip to Toronto and she was very happy we went as it was a great experience for her.  I had the dumplings which were good.  I heard there is always a line there but the wait was not too bad (maybe 15 min)."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite ramen chain. The soup base has the perfect richness and balance of flavors. I enjoy the tonkatsu or tonkatsu black ... Or sometimes the tomatoe ramen which is topped with a jumbo scallop with skirt on. Their egg is beautifully cooked with a gooey yolk while the pork slices are tender and have a deep sake taste to them."}
{"text":"This is one of the better ramen places I've been to (including Tokyo). It's got a small menu which means they do few things, but they do them right. Good ramen, good service, good prices. If you want ramen, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Actually, I am excited about Sansotei opening in Markham, so I could satisfy my ramen craving near home.   Food: I ordered Spicy Tan Tan thick noodles and my friend had the Tonkotsu thin noodles. First of all, the noodles were al dente, but both broth were on salty side but lack of rich taste. I am kind of disappointed because they don't taste like the one at Dundas location.  Service: Server was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Worth every star! I came to Toronto for the night from Buffalo, and there's only one Ramen joint there. So when I saw ramen on yelp I had to go. I'm so happy I did. The ramen was excellent! The servers were very friendly, the food came fast, and it's a nice little restaurant. It is a little small. We were seated at a big table that we actually shared with 3 other people. Honestly it was a little weird just because I'm not used to that, but it was perfectly fine after I got over myself. But don't let that stop you from coming in. It's worth it"}
{"text":"Their wait staff should play and learn the Diner Dash game. My family as a party of five was told to share a table with a couple already at the table. Now the table can sit eight if you're a large group but literally rubbing shoulders with strangers is not comfortable.   The food came relatively quick but one of the bowls had a black fibre on top. Upon closer inspection it turned out to be a thread  from one of the employees black shirts.   Taste of the soup was very salty. The thin slices of  meat in terms of portion was a complete joke, they are seriously cheaping out. The noodles were under cooked and hard.   For $10 this was not worth it, I guess some of the rave reviews about this place is from people who've not had ramen in downtown Toronto or Japan."}
{"text":"2nd time I had ramen at this place and it's definitely exactly what I remembered. Went on a Tuesday around 5:45pm and we were 3rd in line to be seated. Ended up waiting ~10mins but the line grew longer for people that came around and after 6pm. I had their fried chicken apps and spicy tantan ramen. The fried chicken was good but I've had better. The skin was crispy but not crunchy if that makes sense. Their spicy tantan was not spicy for my liking. I had to ask for extra hot sauce on the side. I'm used to ramen places that have additional seasoning on the table and this isn't one of them. Their flavour was boring...nothing outstanding. The broth was not at all rich or flavourful. My friend didn't like the red strings thay came ontop of the ramen as they were hard to chew. Not a lot of meat either, it came with 2 half eggs, 1 slice of pork, and maybe 2 pieces of bamboo shoots. I heard a lot of positives about this place but the taste test failed miserably. I would give it another chance just to try the other ramens. On the other hand, the service was excellent"}
{"text":"Probably one of Kinton's closest rivals in Toronto, but I actually prefer Sansotei over Kinton, mostly because of the atmosphere and lighter broth. This is located in one of the many restaurant-infested areas downtown, near Dundas Square.  I found Kinton's broth to be heavier and saltier. Yes, they do have more varieties and more unique choices (like the cheese one... and amazing karaages) but at the same time you really just want to enjoy the ramen itself and not let the broth overpower it (not too much at least) but pair nicely with it.  I found Sansotei did just that. They have fewer selections, but all the basics are definitely there. Service was also great and speedy, as is with most Japanese chains.  The restaruant is pretty small, as you'd expect for ramen restaurtants, but it is brighter since one of the walls is all glass overlooking the street, which is nice. Seating is limited, but not as sardine-like at Kinton. You actually get some air to BREATHE and eat more comfortably. Prices are the same as you would expect for most ramen places; portion size as well.  If you're a ramen fan but prefer a 'slightly' lighter broth option, do give this place a try."}
{"text":"3.5  What does a vegetarian/halal foodie eat when they go to a pork broth ramen place? ...not much. I saw a new Sansotei location opened up in Richmond Hill, but consistent with their other menus, they didn't have a vegetarian option.   Upon entering, you are immediately greeted in Japanese. The restaurant is clean and aesthetic providing a really great ambience.   Having a lot of friends who enjoy ramen, I usually just get side dishes or whatever vegetarian option they have. The downtown location of Sansotei once made me fried rice which was quite delicious, but I was not able to get that here though I requested. According to my friend who is somewhat of an expert in Japanese culture, requesting a dish off the menu is not common and usually provides the servers with anxiety. Despite that, the staff did point out which side dishes I could get and were accommodating.  So I ended up getting that, the lovely side dishes. The Kaedama chilled thick noodles were delicious - in fact I think this experience really helped me appreciate the quality of the ingredients. The soft boiled egg was cooked excellently, and the shiitake mushrooms were delicious!   The best thing was this option was so cheap! I think it came to under $7. I can't comment on the ramen dishes, but everyone always says it's great.   I wish there was more vegetarian ramen available, but despite that, Sansotei was a nice experience."}
{"text":"There's no line up when I go for lunch on wed, there're still seats available.   Environment is nice, feel clean, comfortable seating with Japanese decorations. Service is good, staff are nice and polite.  I tried the black tonkotsu with thin noodles. It comes with 2 thick slices of pork and 2 half cooked cold egg slices. I've tried some ramen in Osaka, Japan, standard ramen over there comes with 3 thin slices of pork which is nicer in texture. I don't enjoy the pork texture here.   Soup taste good at first, and then the more I eat the more salty and thirsty I feel, I suspect it's because of the MSG.   Noodle is hard in texture, there's a difference with al dente and it's not, it's just hard.   Overall the bowl of noodle is an acceptable lunch but doesn't worth it in this price. And I definitely won't have it as dinner."}
{"text":"First time eating authentic Japanese ramen. It was recommended to me by a friend who lives downtown who was in turn recommended by his Japanese roommate. Therefore, it has the seal of approval. Also, it must be good if you have to line up outside, right?  Food: We both ordered the tonkotsu. Yummy and broth is flavourful. Nothing extraordinary but I haven't really had other ramen before so can't compare. The size of the menu is limited and specialized. Price is quite fair as well.   Service: The waitresses are kind and always greet customers very friendly. They do not rush you. If you are a native and speak Japanese, they will reply back in Japanese haha cute.   Decor: It's a small gem. Because it is so densely packed and being a popular place, you may have to share a table especially if you are dining alone or with a friend. Personally, I don't mind.  Will visit again if I am in the downtown area."}
{"text":"It's ramen season for me all year round!  That's why we decided to check out Sansotei for dinner on a week night.  We ordered the shoyu ($9.50), the spicy tantan ($9.60) and the zangi/fried chicken ($4.50).   Service was quick so we got our bowls almost right away.  Tasty but super salty broth and portions a bit on the small size for the price.  I definitely could have used more food and I'm not a big eater.  Was looking for the $12 ramen+beer combo but didn't see it on the menu or on any signage.  Guess that promotion has passed?  Ramen places are so abundant in Toronto now so I'm likely to go to a few other places before returning to Sansotei."}
{"text":"Braved through stress inducing, hair pulling, hell raising Toronto traffic just to try this place!  Maybe I caught them on a special day as I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen + corn + original noodles and a side of fried chicken because seriously, this is the best ramen I've ever tasted in my life!  I've tried many ramen places all over the US (particularly along the west coast) and this ramen beat them all.  The broth was perfectly seasoned, rich, and flavorful.  While some of the reviews states they felt the portions were small, I honestly thought it was the perfect size for me that left me quite full.  The fried chicken was also amazing!  This place leaves me excited to try other ramen places around town on the next visit!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed by the quality of the ingredients especially the pork. It's getting worse and worse. Last time my friend had the gyu don, he got diarrhea. I just wanna say, I will not come again.."}
{"text":"This place definitely has some tasty ramen! I came here at around 1:00 and waited for about 15 minutes. When we finally sat inside, it took about 10 minutes for my ramen to come. I got the Spicy Tan Tan ramen which wasn't too spicy, just gave it a good kick. My husband got the Tonkatsu Black which was very flavorful. I'll definitely be back here next time with to try out the different dishes!"}
{"text":"Came here at 7:15ish on a Tuesday and waited for almost an hour before we got to eat! ;-;  Tbh I don't know why I had to wait when I could've gone dt to eat it within the time I was waiting in line. -.-  But besides the waiting time, the ramen tastes just as good as the one from dt!  The chicken however was WAYYYYY to oily, not very good. The service is wonderful as expected. The staff was friendly and attentive even though they were super busy! They tried to accommodate all customers!  Not much to say about this but I wouldn't come back to eat if there is a line up. But if there isn't a line I would definitely come back for their authentic Japanese ramen!"}
{"text":"Piping hot bowl of ramen on a cold Toronto night. Perfect if you are staying in the Doubletree by Hilton since Sansotei is just around the corner. I think I ate my ramen too fast, and didn't remember to take pictures. Plus I was starving for some Asian food after returning from Europe.   The menu is limited but from memory, I recall they have four different types of ramen. I ordered the Shiyo Ramen and my boyfriend ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen. Both were perfect. You also have a choice between thin and thick noodle - which most places in Bay Area have only one option.   We also ordered the Wakame Salad and the gyoza. Gyoza arrived kind of towards the end of the meal - which I found odd since appetizers usually arrive at the beginning- but it was piping hot and perfect. As reviewers mention, since the restaurant is a bit tiny (and popular), you have to wait outside and the waitress will call you in as soon as there's seating. I don't like how the bathrooms are located right across from seating, but its a small restaurant so you cant really choose where you end up sitting. Food's great though, and I eat fast so it didn't matter too much to me :)"}
{"text":"The food is good but my experience here was so appallingly bad that I cannot bring myself to give this place anything higher than 1 star.  I have frequented other Sansotei locations and the consistency of product is there. The ramen is good, tonkotsu broth is rich and creamy, and the cha siu was done well.  Basically, during our meal, I suddenly noticed that there was a cloud of dust and dirt falling from the vents above, straight down into our food and drinks. I was shocked and disgusted to see this and I looked over at the group of four waitresses hudled by the cash desk looking up at the vents and laughing amongst themselves. Seriously?!   I was pretty pissed off at this point and i motioned them over and said \"So.. there's a cloud of dust that's falling down onto our table..?\" And the waitress replied, \"oh... i'm not sure.\" And she walked away to call over her manager. The manager comes over and he says \"Yeah that's not dust. We have some people working on the fan right now\" and he walked away looking unapologetic. WOW!  They did not offer to comp the meals or do anything to rectify the situation. Our food was dust-ridden and inedible and yet they didn't bother to do anything or even apologize.   I got up and paid and walked out. Honestly, I'm not sure what the deal is over here. Perhaps they should take it upon themselves to improve their customer service skills. Maybe that's why we were the only table there during lunch hours on a Thursday. Not sure if I'd go back."}
{"text":"Very good ramen! I'm not an expert on the subject but I thought it was well made, all the ingredients tasted fresh, and the broth was enjoyable (from someone who isn't crazy about having soup). The spicy one I ordered (can't remember the name, it was the one at the bottom of the ramen list) actually had a nice kick to it. The meat was really tender too, and the egg yolk was a bit runny.  Service was good too, we arrived at around 6pm on a Wednesday, were seated right away, and food arrived pretty quickly."}
{"text":"The shop opened at 12, and by the time we arrived at 12:05 - we were the last table seated. The line continued the whole time we had our food. Service was slower than anticipated, but also noting that the whole restaurant sat at the same time. The menu is very limited, but that also meant that their quality was very good as they were able to focus on what they were doing. Unfortunately, that day, they only had seaweed salad as an appetizer, and none of the other items were available. The original ramen - first item on the menu was the tastiest. The broth tasted like it had been simmered for hours, and was very flavourful. We ordered 4 different noodles. The tomato one was definitely acidic. The spicy was not that spicy but there is definitely a kick. All of the noodles had tasty toppings and meats. We would definitely go back, but we would make sure to be the first group in line!  https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g181720-d9769968-r449684256-Sansotei_Ramen-Markham_Ontario.html#"}
{"text":"It was frozen outside, you couldn't imagine how happy I was when having a bowl of ramen. I almost cried!"}
{"text":"FOOD:   PRO: I have tried Rokurinsha Ramen at Tokyo so I have very high standards when it comes to ramen. Their Tonkotsu Ramen which was recommended by the waitress and was said the best ramen they have tastes good compared to the others I've tried in Tokyo, it tastes authentic enough. When you compare it to other Ramen restaurants in Toronto, it tastes great and I'd say this might be the best one.   PRICE:   PRO: Inexpensive, standard price for ramen here in Toronto.   AMBIANCE:  PRO: Good casual ambiance. CON: Space is small and during peak hours it gets too tight."}
{"text":"Favourite ramen place in Toronto. I've been here twice and I always get the classic Tonkatsu ramen, never been disappointed. What I like about it is that it's simple but has depth in its flavours. The combination of garlic, green onions, sweet cha siu, noodles and soft boiled egg is epic and ultimately comforting. I love coming here during the winter time for a hot bowl of yummyness after shopping at Eatons.  Fair warning: Lunch times are usually very busy, be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes to get in! I'd say it is worth it."}
{"text":"I am leaning towards 3.5 rating.   The good: The ramen is so good when you're craving some warm, tasty, and soupy goodness. This location is bigger than the downtown one but the wait isn't too bad for a table since ramen is quick. I had the spicy tan tan, and when you've had it, the salt and spice is so satisfying with those thick noodles and perfectly made egg.   The bad: For anyone who cannot have a high sodium intake, I would avoid at all costs. The broth is extremely salty...to the point I worry that it's a health hazard consuming this. I think it definitely surmounts the amount an average person can have in a day.   Dine on but beware."}
{"text":"Love their tonkatsu ramen!! So delicious and perfect for the cold weather. I just get the regular with corn. The noodles have a great texture, the soup base isn't too salty and very creamy, the pork is melt in your mouth perfection, the egg is perfectly runny ... it's everything you want in a ramen bowl. 100% recommend you check it out.  TL;DR Worth the visit. Quality is what you would expect from the downtown shop."}
{"text":"Delicious. Staff is very attentive to detail. Accomodations were great (I suggest going on a slower night if you're selective with your food i.e. vegetarian)  The atmosphere was  pleasant. We enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"The ramen is truly excellent here, and well worth waiting in queue outside to get a seat at this super-popular, no-reservations restaurant. The Tonkotsu Black, with roasted garlic oil, adds some exciting spice to a rich base. Service is quick, if impersonal; with so many customers waiting, one cannot really blame the servers for wanting to process the order and send you on your way in record time. I'll be back sometime to try the miso ramen. Only four stars, though, as there are no vegetarian options, which means I can never come here with my partner. I know that authentic ramen is by definition not vegetarian, but it would be nice to have at least one good option on the menu for our herbivorous friends and family."}
{"text":"Surprise! Surprise! Sansotei is now opened at one of the Sketchiest spots in Richmond Hill!   The ramen tasted better than the other location in downtown. I really can't complain because I didn't hate any of the things I ordered!   The broth was rich, noodles were fresh and the service was great! Most importantly, we finally have something decent in Richmond Hill! No more venturing down to North York or Toronto downtown to have a simple bowl of ramen!"}
{"text":"A very popular small space, had to wait in line outside for a few minutes but it was well worth the wait. Staff are very friendly and the ramen is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. I felt that the flavour of the broth was not as flavourful and I don't think the noodles were fresh either. However, overall it was a good meal.   Side note: I had the fried chicken and I thought that was pretty good."}
{"text":"Finally paid a visit to this Sansotei location. I have always been turned off by the line ups but my friend wanted to come so we came for dinner on a Thursday night. Although we did have to wait in line, the line goes by really fast so we didn't wait long, around 10 mins?  I had the Spicy Tan Tan ($9.60)  spicy ramen topped with a piece a pork belly, a soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, ground pork and shredded chilli pepper. I added Shiitake mushrooms for $0.75 - best decision ever! Shiitake are black mushroom caps, they were soft and tender, tasting very mushroomy - mushroom lovers would appreciate this. The soup actually wasn't that spicy, so that was slightly disappointing. The egg was soft boiled egg was runny, just the way I like. There wasn't that much ground pork though, and I thought there would be at least 2 pieces of pork belly. If only they would have this spicy option without the ground park and just served with pork belly. You also get the option of thin or thick noodles - I had mine thick.  For some reason, it doesn't taste as good as the one in downtown but this definitely would be the spot if i want some good Japanese ramen uptown."}
{"text":"terrible service. No adding water after ordered. Too strong taste of ramen soup. I cannot find any enjoying smell of the pork in side."}
{"text":"The Tonkotsu Black ramen is delicious. The egg is cooked perfectly, the meat is tender and flavourful, and the flavour of the soup has excellent depth. Friendly staff. Small, yet cozy. Quick service. Hot tea is charged, but it is delicious. Would recommend to friends and will return."}
{"text":"Sansotei is by far my favourite ramen place in Toronto. Their broth is consistently delicious and noodles perfectly cooked. My favourite dish to get is the black tonkatsu ramen which is quite filling for only $11. For only $1.50 you can opt for an extra portion of noodles if you're extra hungry. I personally love to get an extra egg, which is always perfectly soft boiled.  I like this location because its larger than most ramen places like kinton and can seat around ~30 people but large groups can get difficult because the large tables are often shared by multiple groups of people."}
{"text":"I have been to Sansotei a handful of times and this review will be an overall summary of my experiences.   The broth is flavourful and the noodles are chewy (the way I like them). I have tried the black tonkotsu, tomato, and spicy tanan. Any of these choices will leave you satisfied, however the black tonkotsu has a bit of a gritty and bitter taste which may not be for everybody. My favourite is the tan tan, but it's a bit of a gamble because the supply is limited, and it may not always be available. The sides and dessert are good, but nothing to go out of your way for. The ramen is what you want.  Service was always prompt, and I love that the entire staff greets and says goodbye to you. They were especially accommodating when my friend thought she lost her ring in the back of the couch. After closing time they took it apart and checked for us. It actually did fall back there and was safely returned :)"}
{"text":"3.6 I have mixed mitigated feelings concerning this new ramen place...  I had the basic Tonkatsu Ramen. At first scoop, I had to agree with the previous comments: the broth is really tasty, thick and rich, much tastier than the ones from most of the other presently existing ramen places. That is perhaps good, but in fact also possibly the problem here...  The ramen is tastier, but also much creamier, along with a fattier and saltier pork belly, pastier (but fresh home made) noodles, and a yolkier egg than elsewhere so far. Hence, at the end, I felt like all of this was an overwhelming composite. I had an extra-noodle portion. However, I left hungry and spent a weird following and uncomfortable night trying to digest all that burden of fat and creamy mixture. Next time, I may try the miso ramen... possibly \"lighter\"?  Otherwise, place is clean, staff is nice. When I went there, two guys were each eating alone on their sides at a 6-place table, but the waiters made me wait until one of them was done to sit me at this same table... although I hate to be packed in common casual restaurants, a ramen place is something different and being packed is almost part of the experience. And ti would have spared 10 minutes of my time not to wait also..."}
{"text":"this is a place i wanted to try for a long time but waited it out because i didn't want to wait in line. i ordered the tonkotsu black and spicy slow cooked wings. it was very filling but at the same time felt very light. you might get a bit thirsty if you drink a lot of the soup like i prefer to do but otherwise excellent. the wings were fall off the bone. i don't handle spicy too well but the spices were about right. a little more than i'd prefer but it gives a nice kick to it."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places, I would want to go back for more.  I ordered a black tonkatsu ramen and Kyoza.  The size of the ramen was slight smaller than that I have had somewhere else.  When you walked in a ramen shop, you can tell if the ramen was good or not by the aroma in the air.  Sansotei was one of them.  The waiter was very polite.    The noodle were one of the better noodles I had had.  Great color with a lot of texture and bouncy.  The garlic in the broth smell great.  The broth was just right - not too salty, but a lot of body and flavor.  It was not just from the garlic.  Even without garlic, the broth itself was greatly prepared and cooked.   Kyoza was ... just kyoza.  It didn't impress me as I expected.  Perhaps because it was a ramen place, not a kyoza place?"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite ramen downtown. But like most ramen, I recommend to get extra meat, extra add ons.. so the meal ends up coming up to like $20. Usually a little wait to get in but once you're in you will have great food and great service. I enjoy the miso ramen and the tomato ramen here."}
{"text":"Sansotei Ramen and all the Sansotei Ramen franchises are all my favourites.  You can't go wrong going to different locations.  All of great quality.  It's usually really packed and you have to wait for a bit. Best times to go is early dinner.  I went with my daughters this time around 5:15 pm and was the second one in line and was seated within minutes.  I ordered the garlic oil miso ramen with thick noodles and my daughters shared a miso ramen with thick noodles.  I like that you have a choice between size of the noodles.  We ordered the fried chicken as an appetizer to share.  My daughters loved the friend chicken.  All in all amazing quality and very tasty broth.  I highly recommend Sansotei Ramen to everyone.  I've been to the Queen street downtown location and Ottawa location as well all amazing at 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I has been visiting Sansotei since last year. I am happy that it opened a new location in Markham! Tastes good, soup are think and the green tea cheesecake is extremely good! the portion is good too, you will never walk out un-full. This location seems to have less people lining up, so it is good for people like me, who look for a great supper after working. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Too bad the staff is still in their learning phase though. The food was fresh and very tasty."}
{"text":"Food is too good!!! had all their appetizers and shoyu ramen. one of the best food experience in toronto"}
{"text":"My friends have all visited and I thought it was about time for me as well; unfortunately, I don't think I'll be going back there again.  Management: we were seated pretty quickly, but as a table of 2, we had to share the big table with other customers because of how small the place is, but no complaints (if you wanted a more intimate conversation, then this is not for you). The kitchen is open concept as well, which is neat.  Cleanliness: our table was a bit sticky, so I refrained from touching it, but the cutlery came after we ordered so it didn't look cluttered.  Service: very nice people and knowledgable of the menu, but slow with water service.  I had the following: Tomato Ramen ($10.75): This comes with scallop, tomato, egg, and shiitake mushrooms specifically; all ramen come with pork belly and your choice of thin or thick noodles. Since I recently decided to stop eating pork, I asked if I could substitute the pork belly with something else and the server said I could pick one veggie (choice of black fungus, shiitake, corn, or bamboo shoot) so I chose black fungus. What came was a bowl of thin noodles in super oily tomato broth, but one HUGE scallop, which was chewy, but HUGE. Guess how many black fungus pieces I got (I used many instead of much for a reason)? 3! Three! THREE pinky-sized pieces to replace the 3 thick slabs of pork belly my friend got! Needless to say, I was flabbergasted at how unfair that was to me, who paid for the \"most expensive\" option. I didn't even finish it because it was so oily.  In brief, I didn't give 1 star because the servers were polite and accommodating and the scallop was GIGANTIC. However, as aforementioned, I won't be returning because I wasn't impressed with the food."}
{"text":"Coming from an individual who has a difficult time selecting a dish to eat from a menu, I appreciate the fact that Sansotei narrowed their menu down to a few choices. Makes life a little bit easier  I ordered the Tomato and found it to be good tasting. Wait time was not very long but would not enjoy waiting in extreme weathers. One bowl would not fill you up very much. If you're almost dying due to hunger, you might as well order 2-3 for yourself."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the tomato soup based ramen. It's unique from the other ramen places in Toronto in that it tastes lighter than your normal pork bone based broth. Portion is decent, similar to other ramen joints in the city. To avoid long lines, I would go right when it opens as there aren't that many seats available."}
{"text":"Was recommend by a close friend of mine, so we give this place a try.....as mention, we get our ticket and wait around 30mins before got seated.  We both order ths something, Spicy Tantan, it was spicy, but a little salty, it was good overall....we try out their Matcha Cheesecake, it was very good...  Money well spend and worth a wait"}
{"text":"My only wish was I never got full here so I could just keep eating. This is the perfect meal on a cold day. I ordered the Garlic pork ramen. Service was very fast. Its a small place so I noticed a lot people had to wait about 5 min for a seat which isnt too terrible. The Broth was so delicious, I would drink a to go cup of it! I always assumed Ramen was like \"Ramen Noodles\" brand but this traditional style is a million billion times better."}
{"text":"Everyone's had instant Ramen noodles growing up, after all, it's practically a staple for any college/university student living on campus. Well Sansotei Ramen is Ramen kicked up a notch to quote Emeril Lagassi... BAM! There you have it.  Fresh ramen noodles is not the same as that packaged stuff; well it is, but not really... Fresh ramen is pre-made, yes; but it's not dehydrated for storage, and then re-hydrated during preparation. Instead it's treated like any other perishable food; that is, it needs to be kept refrigerated or frozen.  Sansotei has kept their menu to a minimum, sticking closely to their trade. This is actually a good sign for me, it's an indication that while they may not serve much in terms of variety, what they do serve will be good... nothing wrong with specialization.  There are basically four elements to a Ramen: the Broth, the Tare, the Noodle, and the Toppings. The Ramen noodles should be alkaline noodles made from wheat flour, baking soda, and water, which makes them more chewy and resilient in a hot soup. The broth is typically a pork based broth, cooked slowly anywhere from 4-60 hours to bring out the flavours. The Tare  is the concentrated flavour base (much like a boullion cube). The foundation of any noodle soup is the broth, the basis for which the entire dish's outcome will be formalized. If the broth isn't perfect, the dish will falter, and short of a miracle, will not be able to recover.  On my menu for the night was: Zangi; Tonkotsu Black; Miso Black; Shoyu, and for dessert I tried the limited time Sakura Crepe Cake.  Zangi is a local term used almost exclusively in a region in Japan, Hokkaido. In Hokkaido, Zangi is fried chicken prepared in their unique style. Soy, garlic, and ginger is typically used to flavour the chicken, then it's battered and deep fried. The Zangi we had was flavoured the same, but was not battered. The chicken was fried to a nice golden brown and the flavours were spot on. An excellent appetizer. 5 stars.  Tonkotsu Black. The Black in this dish refers to the addition of black garlic oil. It was pretty evident that Shoyu Tare was used in this dish (by accident? should have been the shio or salt tare) as the flavour of soy was very evident. I asked for the Tonkotsu noodles with this, and that was what I received. Tonkotsu noodles are lighter in colour and thinner. The noodles m held up well against soup absorbtion. The toppings with this was pork (belly), a soft boiled egg, black fungus, and green onions. The toppings were delicious! Unfortunately the Shoyu tare was a bit much, overpowering the soup base with the flavour of soy sauce. The black garlic oil fought hard against the shoyu, each bite tasting great upon entering the mouth, but the shoyu tare prevailed at the end of every bite. Soup: 1 star; Toppings: 4 stars; Noodle: 4 stars.  Miso Black. As the name suggest, this dish uses the Miso (fermented soy bean) tare, and topped with black garlic oil. The toppings were pork (belly), soft boiled egg, shiitake mushrooms, and green onions. I requested the tonkotsu noodle with this dish as well, and again it held up well to the broth. The toppings again did not disappoint (they make a good soft boiled egg). The black garlic oil added more depth to the soup and complemented it nicely. 4 stars.  Shoyu. Probably named after the Tare used, the soy flavour was very prominent in this dish, to the point that it was overpowering (in my opinion). Toppings with this dish included pork (belly), soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and green onions. The noodles I requested for this was the thick noodle. I was expecting a different noodle altogether, like a Hirauchi, but it turned out to be just a thicker version of the Tankotsu noodle. Soup: 2 stars (right flavour, just too overbearing); Toppings: 4 stars; Noodle: 3 stars (for the disappointment of not getting a different noodle).  Sakura Crepe Cake. A twist on the Meuille Feuille, this cake is many layers of crepe with pastry cream in between each layer. The flavour comes from the Sakura flower (cherry blossom) common to Japan. The saltiness from the crepe combined with the sweetness of the pastry cream was well balanced. Although the dish was aromatic, the flavour was very subtle. A light dessert without much depth. 2,5 stars.  Overall, I give Sansotei 3 stars. While they hit the mark on some aspects, they missed on others, and ultimately the dish as a whole relies on the harmony of all elements. I feel that there is room for improvement in fine tuning their signature dishes. Toppings were a good mix of meat and vegetables, but I felt that the quantity was a little lacking. The Broth should be more prominent, not the Tare. Lastly, a variety of Ramen would naturally be expected at a Ramen Noodle House.  Sansotei Raman has three locations in Toronto and the GTA. Downtown Toronto, Uptown Toronto (North York), and one in Markham (GTA). The one I visited was in Markham, just north of the city."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place! I love ramen, and want to try just about every ramen spot in TO. So, my hopes were high.  The service was OK, and the food came out pretty quickly. I had the tonkutsu black, and it was good but not amazing. They were a bit cheap with the overall portion size, but also with the amount of meat and other ingredients.   I came with a few friends and when one of them asked if they could take their leftovers in a contained they said that they don't allow that... I have heard that doggy bags are uncommon in Japan, but I think this is something Sansotei Ramen should not keep up with because too much food goes to waste! Leftovers are always good for lunch!"}
{"text":"A lovely ramen restaurant. The best time to come here is probably around 2-5pm. I find that there's hardly no line ups around that time. I usually order the Tonkatsu. Very flavourful and it just hits the spot. Comes with lots of meat and a medium cooked egg that's always cooked to perfection. You have the choice of small or large noodles (I usually go with the larger noodles). One thing I was a bit disappointed about was that there was no spicy option for all the ramen flavours, however they do give you some chilli powder on the side so you can add in as much as you want... But it's just not the same :P. Service is friendly and fast. It's a ramen place that I wouldn't mind coming back to but I don't think I love it enough to line up for it."}
{"text":"NOT BAD. Their Shoyu Ramen is a bit tame if not bland. Chicken Karage needs re-tooling. Staff are super polite."}
{"text":"Visited 2 locations (here, North York and the one in Markham)  My boyfriend and I both believe that this location is better than the Markham location by far in terms of food. (When we visited Markham location they were sold out on half their menu.. and the soup was super salty + chashu was mostly fat instead of meat). Highly recommend North York location over the Markham location for better food quality.   Our favorite ramen place by far! The egg is always cooked to a runny perfection! We always go for thick noodles as a personal preference.   Tip: you can ask for topping substitutions or to make it less salty // there is also free underground parking around the back    Pics: regular tonkotsu and black miso"}
{"text":"Picture proof that it's lacking topping quantity. Focused in on onions of miso black.   This is definitely lesser amount compared to standard Sansotei.   But what's nice is that they have an option for less salty vs. regular salty broths now :)  Taste quality is same as all other locations, delicious."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation by my friends. I had the shio ramen with thin noodles, pork belly, soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and green onions in a sea salt broth.  The broth was delicious! I thought it would be too creamy for me but I was happily wrong. I forgot to ask for no pork belly and egg though (I don't like either in my ramen)  And you can never go wrong with bamboo shoots!  I also had their gyoza and zangi (different version of kaarage) and they were average. I wouldn't get them next time. The other reviews are right. The chicken/zangi is not worth it.  I was surprised by how much I liked this place. Will come again to try more things!"}
{"text":"Always come back. Always a line up. Really good ramen. Great service.  Baby friendly! They are very accommodating and have a diaper changing table."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen in the heart of downtown Toronto.  Staff were friendly and service was super quick.  The flavours tasted very similar to Jinya which is located in Vancouver BC.  We tried their miso black and tonkotsu ramen.  The only issue was the seatings were super tight."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen with silky smooth broth and perfectly cooked noodles. I had the tonkatsu with thin noodles and a side of fried chicken. The chicken was also good, though didn't come with a dip sauce. The waitress was kind enough to bring me some mayo and a pepper spice that did the job. Very friendly, fast service. Cute, modern decor."}
{"text":"Although closer to my home, this location waa not as good as the one in Markham. The food was the exact same, but customer service was subpar, venue is tiny, and parking in the area is not free. It's convenient if you live in the area, but i wouldn't recommend commuting to eat here."}
{"text":"Friday lunch for a friends' birthday and had to line up behind a group of 4 (about 1pm), the wait was about 10 minutes.  We were seated at a large table (for my friend and I) and a family of 3 was seated next to us at the same table.  We ordered: - Miso Black, combination of Sapporo and Tokyo style and topped off with a roasted garlic oil, tender slow cooked pork with a touch of heat called Kakuni and topped off with 1 piece of chashu, a soft boiled egg, baby shiitake mushrooms, and green onion. - Spicy Tan Tan is a spicy sesame flavour ramen topped off with a piece a chashu, a soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, ground pork and shredded chilli pepper.   - Gyoza - Fried Chicken, Chicken Karaage (Zangi), Hokkaido style. - Black sesame crepe cake  It was all delicious!  Broth is rich and noodles are fresh--it's been awhile since I have had ramen.  The fried chicken hit the spot (I was craving for fried chicken) and the pork gyoza was nice too--the lightest fare on the table.    The crepe cake however was disappointing, it felt very 'boring'.    The ambiance was warm and friendly, the restaurant is small but charming.  Staff are polite and courteous.  The lack of one star is because everything was great but it didn't blow my mind"}
{"text":"Sansotei Ramen ranks up with some of the better ramen houses I've been to - and I've been to a lot. Not surprised that I had to wait outside for a table. **Very common to wait for 15 minutes or longer at these places. However, keeping in mind that it was a weekday at lunch, on Dundas right behind city hall - 5 minutes wasn't so bad.   Decor was charming, modern, with Japanese pop music playing lightly in the background.   I had a bowl of the Spicy TanTan for $9.60. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. The noodles were perfectly al dente, the pork belly literally fell apart in my mouth, and the broth was rich with flavour. Our waitress brought out a chilli powder shaker with it, but it was already perfectly spiced.   On our way out, I saw a plate of gyoza coming out of the kitchen. Looked like perfection. I have to try that next. I will Definitely come back here. like tomorrow."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner at 8:45pm as per the advice of some yelpers.  Didnt have to wait that long to get seated.  The place itself is bigger than most ramen places that ive been to, so that is a plus for me.  Service was pretty good, fast and friendly.  The menu was simple, just one small page.  Which is a good thing, some restaurants have novels for a menu with thousands of items to pick.  We ordered two sides (gyoza,zangi), three ramens (tonkatsu, tonkatsu black, miso black) and the dessert (mango cheesecake).  The sides were good and delicious, the only draw back was that is was drenched in oil.  Some yelper said that their sides were heavy on grease, which was true.  If you dont mind all that oil go ahead and eat away.  The miso black was very good.  The ramen noodles was cooked to perfection.  The broth was good but a little bit on the salty side.  The mushrooms that came with it was flavourful, i think they marinate the mushrooms first before they cook it hence the flavour. I also like how they put black garlic oil which enhances the flavour of the ramen, brings out more deeper fla our profiles.  The mango cheese was a unique dessert, because i have never tried cheesecake thats mango flavoured.  It taste ok, it even has real pieces of mango in the cheesecake.  Overall the experience was good, though it is not the best ramen place ive been too.  Check out my other reviews to find out my vote for best ramen place.  I would dedinitely come back when im in the area."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Sansotei? I've been coming here to get my noodle fix for years and it will always be my number 1 ramen place in Toronto.  Very consistent, the broth is one of the richest amongst the other ramen places but that's why it's so tasty! I always get the tonkotsu black with thick noodle, and chicken karage on the side.  Good to indulge when your sodium count is low."}
{"text":"Their tonkotsu black with extra chasu is definitely my favourite on the menu!  Preferred over kinton as the broth is not as oily and greasy."}
{"text":"Sansotei is the most legit ramen in downtown Toronto. Their broth is hearty and full of flavour, their noodles are just the right amount of chewy and their pork belly is always generous.   Definitely a must-try when you're in Toronto. If the lineup at the 2 downtown locations are too long for you, your runnerup is Santouka."}
{"text":"WARNING: this may be a biased review because I am not really fond of ramen or maybe ramen just doesn't hit my palette right for it to leave a scrumptious impression... HOWEVER, I do try to be open-minded and I do try out places for ramen here and there. This is my two cents. Take it or leave it!  Alright, so I heard this was the place that had an amazing reputation for their ramen. Line ups form for this place, how insane is that?! So, I checked this place out with a friend and we had to line up (as expected). Fortunately, the line moved pretty quick. The waiting time was about 10mins (we had at least 5 people in front of us).  I ordered the Tonkatsu Dark ramen with thin noodles. The broth was a bit too salty for my liking however, the pork belly was amazing. It was a good portion for lunch but I don't know about dinner... you'd probably have to order something on the side or add extra noodles to be full. The ramen came pretty quick, so that is a plus for those of you who cannot wait to indulge.   Aside from the ramen experience, my friend and I had our jackets on the whole time because we were seated right next to the door. It didn'tcome to mind that the door was going to keep opening and closing because of the line up (since eating a bowl of tasting hot ramen was all we thought about). It wasn't the best experience as first-timers here because we were freezing our butts off while enjoying our hot bowl of ramen. We wouldn't mind if the weather was warmer however, we visited on one of the coldest days!  So, if you're going during the cold season, make sure you don't get seated next to the door. I suggest to wait another 10mins out in the cold for a warmer seat rather than feeling hot and cold during your meal!"}
{"text":"???????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????????2???????????????????  ???????????????3?????? ???????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????  ?????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I gave them 5 star because this is the second best ramen placed I've ever been. Visited CN Tower and decided to get ramen as we've been craving for a good ramen. Used Yelp to locate this place and we are satisfied about this recommendation.  As we approach the location we noticed that there's a line outside and that's a good indication that this place is popular and they served good or I should say great ramen.   Waited for maybe 15 to 20 minutes before we got seated. The inside was not that big they only have 7 tables total if I remember it right but service was fast. I ordered the Spicy Tantan and it was amazingly good. The broth is so flavorful and the order comes with pouch egg and pork. You have the option to choose if you want a thin noodle or thick noodles and I had ordered the think noodles.   Worth the walk to this place and the prize is very affordable. For less than ten dollars this is the best ramen place to visit when you're in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is ridicules. The waitress is so rude. My friend and I went there today the waitress literally kicked us out restaurant with no reason . She needs to learn how to serve customers. Good luck for the customers to have this waitress to serve"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen - Tonkotsu. They recommended the thin noodles with Tonkotsu, but I liked the thick noodles after trying my friend's. Good service. Will try their other ramen next time, will try their other soup base next time. Expect a line up even during weekdays but the wait wasn't too bad (we waited about 10 minutes for 2 people)."}
{"text":"Took my parents here and it was their first time trying Ramen and they loved it! The service was great, the server was more than willing to answer my parents question. We started with the zangi, which with the lemons juice squeezed on too was nice and savory. We all got the tonkotsu Ramen with the thin noodles, just the basic Ramen bowl but it was delicious. Left full and ready for a nap. So glad I brought my parents here for their first Ramen experience!"}
{"text":"I was craving some black garlic oil ramen so I came here. We tried the black miso and tonkatsu black ramens. The ramens came with an egg, vegetable and pork.  The tonkatsu black was very creamy and delicious and the black miso was also very good. Good for a quick ramen fix."}
{"text":"I'm so happy they opened another location more north of the OG. Sansotei is my favourite ramen restaurant and I always get the tomato based one.   The service was great, as is all their other locations that I've been to, and it wasn't too busy when I came (around 2pm on a weekday). Will definitely be going to this location more for the convenience."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of ramen - mainly because it can be really salty and heavy, BUT Sansotei makes a damn good bowl. I always get the tomato ramen with thick noodles and it's never disappointed me yet, and neither has the exceptional service despite the long lines."}
{"text":"The food is good, but it's near impossible to get a seat and they only open on certain days within specific hours.  It's like unlocking the devinci code whether you'll have to wait an hour of a table or if the restaurant is closed that day.  The ramen isn't THAT good that it's worth the wait and erratic operating hours."}
{"text":"Sansotei Ramen gets major props and is frequently argued as the best ramen shop in Toronto.  I don't think I'd go that far, but in all fairness they seem to largely specialize in thick, softer noodles, while I prefer mine thinner and firmer.  It's possible this place is playing to a slightly different, non-me demographic, and I'm fine with that.  Can't win 'em all.  That said, the broth and the flavors are good, but they don't quite deliver the same depth or impact as Santouka and Kinton.  The toppings aren't nearly on the same level either, so if that matters to you I'd highly recommend exploring those other two options.  Regardless, if you're looking for big thick noodles in your ramen, this is probably the best option in the downtown area.  It's not a disappointing place, but the ramen bar is really, really high in this city."}
{"text":"My fiancee (what did I get myself into?!) and I came to Toronto during a frigid December (another questionable choice) and were really itching to try some ramen as Philly lacks really good ramen spots (no friends, Terakawa isn't THAT good).   We initially were going to go to Sansotei and split a ramen and then head to Ramen Isshin afterwards to spread our meal into two and lengthen our day but it was 1:00pm and we waited a good ~15 minutes outside in 10 degree weather so it was decided that we would skip isshin for another time (Note, you will be waiting outside if there is a line, and by the time we finished eating, it was twice as long as when we first got there). We each got our own individual bowls, hers being the a traditional tonkotsu (~$12 CAD) with thin noodle and mine being the more adventurous miso black (~$14 CAD). The bowl came out and I took a bite out of the mushroom and I knew from that single bite that this was going to be an awesome bowl of ramen. The black garlic was stronger and more distinct that many bowls I've had in California. I continued eating and was not disappointed, nor was my girlfriend with her bowl of tonkotsu. Having had my fair share of ramen throughout California, I can say this is on on-par with the best of them including Santouka and the likes. Everything, besides the meat, was spot on. The pork was a little less fatty than anticipated and lacked the texture that I yearn for when I eat ramen but the broth itself was on point.  All in all, would wait again outside for 15 minutes in 10 degree weather. In fact, I would wait outside again for 30 minutes in 10 degree weather. Come but be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent ramen and dumplings. We had the tomato ramen which was wonderful with mushrooms and a prawn, egg, and pork. The tonkotsu was also excellent with a rich cream taste seasoned with pork,  eggs,  and the correct amount of green onions.   The food was fresh and delicious,  the room was busy but not loud.     The service was good,  with room for improvement."}
{"text":"I probably should have reviewed this place earlier because I would have given it 4 stars. I have had their ramen too many times that it has lost its appeal. I do love their Tomato ramen which comes with a scallop, one piece of pork belly, and shiitake mushrooms. There is a large chunk of tomato at the bottom of the broth too. I like the other ramen they have like the Tonkotsu Black, but for some reason I remember the downtown location having more flavourful broth. There seems to always be a bit of a wait no matter what time you go, but service is quite fast. I also recommend the chicken karaage which is usually pretty good! I think this ramen restaurant is still my favourite of the several authentic Japanese joints."}
{"text":"Sansotei was always on bookmarked on my check list but now I'm very delighted to say I took to the time out of my day to try this place out!   There was a wait at 5:00pm on a Tuesday night, I was already impressed considering its late week day afternoon. But like all ramen places, it's quite cozy.  There was several soup base you can try, ranging from soy-sauce based Shoyu, Miso, spicy , and to their special milky and creamy Tontouka..and Tontouka Black. Let's look at the following by it's attributes, for the Tontouka Black ramen: Soup: milky,creamy, with a dab of garlic oil. Very bold, flavourful, a little salty. Pork belly: soft, tender, fatty goodness. They did not cheap out of the width of each slice ramen: you get an option of thick or thin! The original was thin, and the ramen were slurpable! Toppings: I have to say I'm quite dissapointed with the egg. I wished it was a little marinated and gooey like the one in Guu.  Overall, I was happy with my first visit!! For those of you who can finish a Large pho bowl, you might need to order extra noodles since the portion is equivilent to a small pho bowl"}
{"text":"Sansotei Ramen probably one of the more authentic Japanese Ramen experience in the neighbourhood.  I have been to other Sansotei Ramen's location in Toronto and Markham so I do know what to expect. A great tasty bowl of Ramen!  I do like the set up of this location as there are more smaller tables as it is great for single diner like myself.  Tonkotsu Black with Thin Noodle was yummy and really hit the spot.   I would be back when I have this ramen urge again!"}
{"text":"It took me 3 tries before I able to enjoy the Ramen at Sansotei!  First Try: - At 5:30 pm on a weekday afternoon, they ran out of broth?!!!! I was asked to come back at 7:00 pm?!!  Second Try: - My fault, I didn't check or my friend didn't check their business hours...Closes on Sundays! And of course no Ramen when we dropped by on a Sunday afternoon  Third Time is a Charm: - No wait! Nice and quiet restaurant! - My Tonkotsu Ramen ($9.25) has a well flavoured milky broth with that nice sweet after taste of pork. Noodle cooked perfectly medium with just the right bite - Service was excellent, though it still took 20 minute for my Ramen to arrive in an empty restaurant?! I can't imagine how long it will take if the place is packed!  I will be back for more! But I doubt I will line up for it...... If there is a line, I will just come back when Sansotei is not busy! I am NOT going to wait in line for any Ramen... ok maybe Totto Ramen in NYC..."}
{"text":"I am glad that Sansotei opens another location up in Markham. It is just hard to get decent Ramen North of 401.   This place is always busy in the evening. I had give up having dinner here as I don't see myself waiting half a hour for a table even at 9 pm?! For me Ramen is supposed to be something fast and convenient.  Dropping by for a late lunch worked the best for me as I never waited for the table. Service always be fast and polite. My usual is always Tonkatsu with thick noodles. The broth rich and creamy, noodle with the perfect bite.  Double check opening hours as lunch only serves Ramen during weekdays and without any sides."}
{"text":"This place is very nice and the ramen is great soup base and soft boil egg everything good! Thumb up little wait but quick service and the dessert that crepe cake is a bomb ! Glad to find this place :) Canada trip a must :)"}
{"text":"Really good ramen! Went there around 7:30 on a Friday night. Had to wait about 10 minutes. They keep everyone who has to wait outside, so they're not standing around inside.  Menu is pretty simple-ramen,ramen,or ramen. I got the Tonkotsu Ramen and it was great! Great deep flavor. Also got the Gyoza, they were okay. I would probably pass on them next time. Fast service. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Top ramen spot in Toronto. I ordered the T black wwith thin noodles. The broth was heavy but yummy. You can add bamboo shoots as extra They're doing a special meal now, any ramen with a sapporo beer for 12 bucks.I believe it's a good deal especially when I checked the price of a bowl of single ramen was 10bucks lol. Japanese boss and  authentic flavor"}
{"text":"I walked into the restaurant around noon, and was surprised at how quickly the restaurant was able to seat my party of five. The restaurant itself is fairly small, and the line up was very long when we were leaving.  I ordered the Spicy TanTan ramen with thick noodles. Inside there was pork belly, ground pork, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, an egg and green onions. The meal came fairly quickly, as the servers needed to turn the tables as quickly as possible. When I tried the broth, it was flavourful; mild and not too spicy, but I did feel that it was a bit too salty. However, the noodles and the toppings were well-cooked and yummy.  Also, I felt that the portion size was a bit small. The ramen bowl cost $9.60, but I was still hungry after the meal was over.   Overall, the ramen is decent, but there are many other ramen places that are probably just as good that offer a better price for a larger quantity of food."}
{"text":"It was a bit crampy, extra people are squeezed in between chairs. The ramen was okay, definitely not worth all the great reviews on yelp. Maybe it is the best in toronto but it has a long way to go to have the 4 stars. I am giving 4 just for the admiration of locals."}
{"text":"I'm usually pretty meh about ramen - I will eat it, but for most other places I think they are mediocre at best and pretty much the same with one another. Sansotei is so far the only ramen place that actually stands out to me and that I can honestly say that I actually like. I definitely recommend coming for an earlier dinner here, because it's a really small restaurant and once it gets past like 6 pm people start lining up outside. So what actually differentiates Sansotei from other ramen places? I think for me, it's a combination of the noodles (not too soft and also a bit chewy in texture) and the broth being creamy and flavourful but also light, not too salty, not too oily or heavy, as these are usually the problems I find with other ramen places. It's enjoyable to the point where sometimes I will even drink a little bit of the soup once I've finished the noodles (I never ever do this at other places, I think it's gross.) I've only had the tonkotsu ramen here (pork belly), but it's a safe staple you can't go wrong with, and their dumplings are alright but nothing to rave about. Still a solid contender for best ramen place in Toronto though!"}
{"text":"I already wrote a review on Sansotei in Markham since my experience there was a little rough.   This location recently opened so its not as busy as the Markham location and I like the interior better. You don't have to sit with random people if you are in a group of four.   The menu is the same and the food has the same authentic taste to it. Their menu isn't that extensive so don't be surprised. I've tried most of their items and am not disappointed with the flavor it delivers.   Will go back soon to try everything else :)"}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here but I've had a fair share of ramen in Canada, Korea and Japan. The waitress recommended TONKOTSU (with pork belly, black fungus, boiled egg and spring onions) and said it's their best seller.   TONKOTSU - there's a choice of thick or thin noodles. I chose thin. The broth was flavourful and not too salty, but unfortunately it wasn't hot. The pork belly was the best part of the dish! They were large, thick slices and I even ordered EXTRA CHASIU (2 extra slices of pork belly),not knowing that a total of 4 slices is actually too much. Next time, I won't need to order extra dishes.   DAIFUKU - Chocolate dusted rice balls filled with Japanese cream cheese. Note: The cream cheese is unsweetened.  The service was fast and the servers were very friendly recommending dishes to us!"}
{"text":"I love their noodle soup, broth is so tasty, pork belly is a little bit smelly. But my colleague thought their soup broth was bit extra salty comparing to our last visit maybe a month or two ago."}
{"text":"Sansotei Ramen is the place to come for authentic ramen, complete with a fattier soup base that is a result of hours of flavor development. I had the tonkatsu black ramen, which had the great garlicky flavor in the soup that I love. You can choose between thick and thin noodles, but they recommend that you pick the thinner noodles for a more authentic bowl. I appreciated that the pork wasn't too fatty and that the noodles were cooked perfectly! It's not the best bowl of ramen I've had, but it's definitely up there."}
{"text":"I always go to a couple times to any restaurant before reviewing to be fair and give a realistic review. I've been to Sansotei in downtown Markham 2 times and its one of my favourites.   I am a big fan of their Black Ramen with thick noodles. The broth is flavourful,  rich and creamy. The thick noodles are cooked perfectly with a nice bite and texture to them.  The eggs are expertly cooked so that they are runny in the middle and are delicious.  There is a line up depending on what time of day you come (usually dinner)  but it moves pretty quickly like any ramen joint as turnover is high since people tend eat quickly and leave.   I highly recommend this place as its become my new favourite in the north east end of the city."}
{"text":"Same menu just like all other locations. There are more smaller tables good for 1-3 diner.  Overall I still prefer the food at Markham location.  The gyudon is definitely better there."}
{"text":"Their Tonkotsu is really good. Their tomato ramen is also outstanding.  They have the best soft boiled egg.  Their zangi (deep fried chicken) is hot and juicy and their service is really fast too.  Definitely will come back again and again."}
{"text":"Don't know what else you'd want in a bowl of ramen but this place is perfect for a cold winter day (or any day really). Tasty, simple yet complex bowl of awesomeness.   Be ready to wait in line outside as there isn't much seating in the restaurant and it's popular. Not very good for large groups. All ramen are just under $10 (I believe). Be prepared to pay big bucks for alcohol."}
{"text":"TL;DR: A great bowl of ramen  We were looking to try something else nearby but we saw that this place was packed on a Monday evening and decided on a whim to head in here instead.  When we went in, there were only two seats left at the window, but since we like people watching, we felt that it was an okay compromise. We ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen with bamboo shoots and the Tonkatsu Black Ramen, which is Tonkatsu with garlic oil, and comes with all the fixin's of the regular Tonkatsu. We also added additional Chashu (always a good choice) and corn as well.  The noodles came out extremely quick (like Pho quick) and were of the right chewiness that I liked. The Chashu was of the right variety. Not too fat or too salty.   Overall, for a whim choice on a Monday evening near Chinatown, this place was pretty great. Will definitely come back for another bowl when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Long lineup. Quite crowded and small inside. There is no air conditioner so it was really sticky and hot, especially with the rainy weather outside. The ramen was good but too salty. It gave me a headache afterwards. The waitresses are all super friendly though."}
{"text":"The shop itself was nice, but the food was distinctly sub-par.  The soup was bland and under-seasoned, the noodles were under-cooked (there's al dente, then there is whatever this was), and most unforgivably: the bamboo shoots and Judas ear were cold and the sort of slimy that comes from having been refrigerated a bit too long and not warmed up. Just stirring them into the ramen or pouring the soup over them would have fixed this, but apparently the chefs can't be arsed."}
{"text":"New location for Sansotei! I'm really glad because the other location in Markham always got too busy and this is much closer. The plaza it's located in doesn't get a lot of traffic so it's pretty easy to miss this place unless you actually look up Sansotei.   The restaurant is much smaller and some of the seats are made to only fit two people, unlike the other location where you would often share a 4 person table with another couple. They have the regular menu items that the other locations have, along with Millie pattersie crepe cakes for dessert. My favourites are the zangi fried chicken appetizer and the spicy Dan Dan ramen.  The restaurant is clean and the staff are well trained. There also aren't any long line ups since not many people know about this new location yet which is great!"}
{"text":"Their lines have gotten shorter (at least from what I saw at around 5:30-6:30PM), as they used to go out the door. We ordered the tonkotsu black ramen with thick noodles, the spicy dandan ramen with thick noodles, and a side order of zangi (fried chicken to share). Both of our bowls didn't come with that much meat but the soup is SO good we drank all of it. We didn't mind not having that much pork in our ramen because we got the fried chicken but if you order just the ramen I think you might be in a bit of a disappointment about that. Other than that I think everything was great!"}
{"text":"There is so much good ramen in the downtown core.  This place is no exception.  It's reliable and delicious but is a small place and lineups can be long.  I stumbled across it because there was a line and decided to wait and give it a whirl.  I wasn't disappointed.  But with so many good places, I am not sure I would wait in a long line again."}
{"text":"Good satisfying ramen located in strip mall with lots of parking.  Place seems family friendly as it is big and has large tables.   Got there around 130pm on a Sunday and had to wait for about 20mins for a table of 2.    I had the chicken karaage and black garlic ramen.  Chicken karaage was just ok the the ramen was very good.  Satisfy broth with deep pork flavor and chewy noodles.  They also have dessert from millie patisserie which is awesome and I was able to try the sakura crepe cake (this was back in march)."}
{"text":"My new go-to ramen shop. Fast covers and well-trained staffs. Amazingly creamy and well balanced broth w/ great noodles. Honestly try everything!!! my favorite is the spicy tantan adding extra egg and noodle is worth the cost if you have a big appetite"}
{"text":"I have never imagined myself to be a noodle eater. In fact I have always hated noodles. However, today I was invited by a friend to this place and all I have to say is I am in love with ramen! The soup was so rich in flavours and the noodle actually tasted awesome. They don't have many choices on their menu, but I don't see the need of having more (as I really don't mind eating just the same noodle soup everyday!) Overall highly recommeneded."}
{"text":"First of all, I love salty food.   I probably eat 5 times of daily sodium allowance on a regular weekend days (dine out twice a day).  I had lunch at Sansotei last Tuesday, and I found the soup base/broth too salty.  The saltiness overwhelmed all other flavours in the broth.  The salt level is the sole reason that contributes to the average rate.  Aside from it, the noodle was fresh and al dente.  The pork bellies, bamboo slices, etc were all fresh.  Services were efficient."}
{"text":"This is my table side romance for Sansotei Ramen, where I had one of the best ramen of my life.   It was an unique experience in the senses where I dined alone mindfully - started by observing the ramen, admiring the glistering looking black garlic oil, smelling the aroma of the broth, the shimmering egg white and yolk. it was stunning! Tasting each component (broth, charred garlic oil, green onion, bamboo, black fungus, egg) separately. Mixing all the components together and tasting it as a whole. Adapting the traditional Japanese method to appreciate the food by slurping the noodle and slurping the broth directly from the bowl!  Felt like I just had the whole galaxy in a bowl! :)"}
{"text":"The ramen was delicious!!! We came in and sat at a community table with some other people. The waiter didn't recommend anything but thankfully I looked up some reviews before I came in. I ended up ordering the TanTan Ramen with extra eggs. The only reason why I gave 4 stars is because they had a wait line outside the restaurant and it was fairly cold outside."}
{"text":"Went to here several times but turns out I don't really like it. Ramen is way toooooooo salty and portion is very small lol...."}
{"text":"Best ramen in the great city of Toronto.   The whole experience at Sansotei is  lovely and well done, and the service is genuine. Every bowl of ramen that I've been lucky enough to have has been perfect. The noodles are chewy and the broth rolls across your tongue and reminds you that if the ice age suddenly hit, you would be ready for it. What is important with a ramen broth is that the fat in the broth is enough to sit slightly on your tongue and sponge a tad in that moment, and in the combination of the salts and umami you gain the appreciation that ramen deserves.  I used to give the 'best' title to Kinton until I found myself standing in line (me! standing in a line) in -25 degree weather for a single seat in this tiny establishment. When I came out after having my bowl of Black (garlic oil) Tonkatsu, I ran into a friend who was waiting her turn. That was the moment I knew I was in love.   SJ"}
{"text":"This is one of the closest Ramen places to me. I frequent this place often because of the convenience.  Many will not know, but there is free parking around the back. Otherwise, if you park on the street directly out side, it is enforced by Green P.  I normally get the black garlic ramen. It's pretty standard issue but really hits the spot when you're craving something savory. I would normally get the Karage as an app but not here because it's not exactly worth it - but that's just my opinion.  One thing about this place is that their soft boiled egg comes out cold. Would rather it served warm. That's my only criticism about the place.  Otherwise, it's a brand new location. Small space with bar seating and maybe 6-7 tables. Service is great. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Came here around 5:30pm with a friend, we were seated immediately, it's really easy for pairs to get seats...though we were near the door. It was really cold and every time someone came in, a cold gust of wind hit us. Fortunately, ramen is eaten quickly. The food itself was great - the broth was really rich and noodles were fresh. I had the tonkotsu black ramen and it was quite good. Service was decent - our orders were taken fairly quickly and we were out of there within an hour. Minus a star for not having a double door..."}
{"text":"Very good ramen! The best I've ever tried! Today I tried the tomato ramen, with eggs, mushrooms and shrimp.. fantastic!! I thought I would not like it, but it exceeded my expectations! Recommend it!"}
{"text":"Usually, I've found these ramen places to be typical and none stood out but this place is awesome! I got the tonkotsu ramen with sansotei original noodles (they ran out of thin ones) and it was delicious! The broth in this place is what makes it special. I'm not sure what they put in it, but I can drink that all day and I usually don't drink ramen broth.  Oh and do get the sansotei originals. I find them to be far better than their thick ones, which are much chewier."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places I've been to in my life lol (and coming from a Californian). Noodles were chew and the broth was soo flavorful. The pork was also delicious. Definitely would come back if/when I go back to Toronto."}
{"text":"Tried the Spicy Tamtam Ramen. It was delicious. Friends had the Shoyu Ramen. Make sure you add an extra egg!"}
{"text":"Definitely among the best Ramen Toronto has to offer. The texture of their noodles achieves the perfect balance between chewy and soft. Be sure to order your bowl with thick noodles to enjoy the texture of the noodles to their fullest! For noodle lovers with an appetite, you can double the amount  of noodles in your bowl for only $1.  Dessert is also fantastic. The daifuku mochi comes highly reccomended."}
{"text":"Although the noodles itself is very good, the broth makes it incredibly salty and greasy. The zangi chicken wasn't too great either, it's just deep fried chicken bits with salt and pepper with a wedge and lemon. You're better off going to a different ramen place or a chain like Ajsen ramen."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times and usually get the Tonkotsu or Tonkotsu Black which are good.  Tried the Spicy Tan Tan and it was fantastic! There's only a limited amount made each day, so don't arrive too late.   Quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"We heard that Sansotei was opening today and came for some tasty Ramen.   We got  the Tonkotsu Ramen with thin noodles and loved it. The pork is very soft and tender  with a good flavour.  The soup part was  not bad is was not salty which was great for us . I liked the way the noodles and egg were cooked  as they were very soft and not chewy  . We will  be back to Sansotei  for more ramen adventures. For an opening day service was excellent . Check out Sansotei and enjoy some really good ramen"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago.  I got a basic Tonkotsu  ramen   . I enjoyed the overall dish. It  felt just right to me and was not salty. The noodles were not like rubber.  Sansotei is my favourite  ramen spot.  I have dined at the city place and square one locations and the experience has been great. I will always be back  for more lovely ramen"}
{"text":"I came to Sansotei for a weekend dinner and the restaurant was busy, but not busy enough that I didn't get a seat. I shared a table with a couple. There was at least a space between us, but a short while later, they seated a total stranger in front of me. Awkward. It was like friends having dinner who couldn't stand talking to each other.  I decided to order the tonkatsu black (garlic) ramen. I thought that the broth was decent. It was just as creamy as other places. However, I thought that the noodles were too chewy. It softened up further as time passed. The egg was not as eggcelent as I would have liked. It was soft in the middle, but at the edges, was a little too cooked. The pork was perfectly tasty, though. So far this is the cheapest ramen restaurant that I've visited in the downtown Toronto area, which may be why it's so popular and I often see long line-ups at night."}
{"text":"Very similar to Isshin, good consistent quality. Always get the black sesame broth, not a fan of the lines"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Unionville. When you are looking for a quick bite to eat this is the place to go. The ramen is very authentic and similar to Japan. The soup is to die for, my favorites are tonkotsu and tomato! The servers are very friendly and attentive. When you are looking for good comfort food I recommend coming here to satisfy your noodle cravings!!"}
{"text":"We're pretty spoiled here in the Bay Area with delicious ramen. I had high hopes for this place given the high reviews. However, we were a little underwhelmed by the taste. I must admit the noodles and the broth seemed of great quality, but it wasn't tasty nor delicious enough to justify a recommendation or a second visit back to this place.   There was a 5 minute wait when we arrived on a Saturday at noon for lunch. We were surprised there was no wait, but of course a line started forming shortly after we were seated. We had the bar seats near the window, which we didn't mind. Despite having people watching me eat from outside, it was not a bother. The service was quick and the menu was easy to read. The restaurant is pretty tiny and slim so it was hard to walk without bumping into people's chairs.   We had to get the black ramen, the bf got the black tonkotsu ramen and I had the black miso ramen, both opted for thin noodles. We got our foods in less than 10 minutes. The broth was honestly something I could not remember. The taste was a bit odd and I was sad I couldn't make it spicy. They provided the basic spice powder which is more for flavoring than taste. The thin noodles were too thin, I think we should've gotten thick noodles instead. The bf's black tonkotsu ramen tasted weird, he thought mines tasted better. The portion was decent and there were enough pork slices. I was quite full towards the end. The broth wasn't delicious enough for us to finish. On the bright side, my ramen dish came with a flower and the presentation looked great. Total came out to a little less than $30 CAN. I must admit, the mushrooms in my ramen were great. Best part of the meal.   Overall, this was just okay. We decided not to try any other ramen spots in Toronto after this experience; perhaps we are just blessed with great Asian foods in CA. Hehe."}
{"text":"Visits: 1st Rating: 4.5* Service: good service, friendly Dishes: Tonkotsu; Miso  This is some good ramen. One of the top 3 best ramen places we have been to in 2013. It's all in the broth. Very bad for you rich in pork flavor type broth. Absolutely delicious.  -Tonkotsu Ramen (5*). Best pork broth that I could remember. Wifey introduced me to ramen & ever since my first taste of it, we've been on our search for some good ramen. This is on our list as one of the best. This broth is rich, creamy & full of pork flavor. So bad for your heart, but you only live once. Slurp away. I believe we licked this bowl dry. -Miso Ramen (4*). I've had miso ramen many times before & have never been impressed. It always had a weak flavor, so I was hesitant to order miso here but took the plunge anyways. So glad I did. They do it right here. Great flavors of miso mixed in with some porkiness. Was not disappointed at all. Yum."}
{"text":"they have multiple locations but too bad the broth isnt consistent. i love their tonkotsu black here!! the markham location was so watered down and bland, it tasted like watery milk/cream. the downtown location is always on point w.its broth!  the chicken karaage is good but too oily."}
{"text":"This is a pretty popular ramen joint in the plaza with the whole foods. The food is consistently good and service is always fast and attentive.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Black w/ thick noodles, the gyoza's, and the slow cooked spicy chicken wings. All of which i thought was pretty outstanding for the price point.  Service was a 5/5 Food was 4/5"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try, boy things have changed. The ramen tasted much better than my first visit. Ordered the tonkatsu black. Pork belly melted in my mouth with a hint of charcoal taste. Soup was perfect and the noodles were made well. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Line up was like 10 mins. The noodles were really good, the broth was flavorful and had depth to it. The karage chicken was moist and crispy, the portion was 5 nugget sized pieces. The service was friendly and very polite. The tea is $2 otherwise, very good. Worth returning. Will rec to others!"}
{"text":"Tried out this place for the first time with the boyfriend because he was really craving ramen and this place was rated the top on yelp. If you make it before dinner rush then you don't have to wait too long. I'm not a big fan of ramen but my dish was still good. Lots of flavour but a bit too salty to my liking. Waitress' are prompt with filling cups with water and they accept cash/debit/credit payments."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small with several tables of 2. If you're a bigger crowd, good luck getting a table. The restaurant was busy Friday night and we squeezed 3 in a table for 2. We ordered the spicy slow cooked chicken wings to start.  It was not spicy at all. It was basically soy chicken wings. Boring and soft. I was very disappointed with them.  We then ordered the tonkotsu black, miso black and tomato. Warning: The black garlic has bits of black specks and hard to crunch down. One speck got lodged in my throat and after coughing and lots of water, I finally dislodged it but my throat was sore for a couple of days. The chashu was pale and bland. Portions are small."}
{"text":"This is the original location and by far the best. After having a disappointing meal at the new Richmond hill location I was reluctant to eat at another Sansotei. I have to say my pork ramen (thin noodles) at this location was amazing! The pork was so tender with a nice deep sear and the broth was really savoury and not too salty."}
{"text":"Love the ramen here !  It's walking distance from Eaton centre  Visited this place after all the great views and it did not disappoint me.  The place is small but all ways packed. There is always a wait for their ramen.  Luckily we did not have to wait too long for a table of four. We waited about 5-10 minutes.   I ordered the Black Miso Ramen. The presentation of the ramen was really pretty. The dish came with a purple edible flower on top. I did not eat the flower though. The broth was salty and flavourful. Portions a small, so if you are a big eater, you might want to add extra noodles or order two bowls.   This is one of my favourite places for ramen now Definitely recommended   Service: Ok Food: Excellent Price: Ok"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in the past three weeks and I am obsessed! Its a bit out of the way for me but it is so worth it. The staff is extremely friendly and very very attentive even when it is so busy! One thing to note is that due to the popularity, sometimes the wait can be long but it is definitely worth it! The ramen is great and the broth is perfectly creamy and rich. They also give you tons of toppings and have perfect portions :)"}
{"text":"I pass by this place a lot on my lunch breaks at work and there's always a line up. I went to try it out on a Saturday for late lunch and again there was a small line-up. We waited outside for about 10 mins and were seated quickly in a long table with others. I had the black miso and my friend had the spicy tantan with thick noodles. They were both just ok, definitely not good enough to justify the line outside. I thought the portions were kind of small and we both left with too much room for dessert. Besides the food, service was good, the server was super friendly."}
{"text":"Miso Ramen was okay... soup base had simple flavours and the noodles were not perfectly cooked.  Nothing special.  Won't make an effort to go back considering I live midtown.  Slow service.  I guess it keeps the fake line going outside.  Recently had Miso Ramen in Sapporo Japan, not even close."}
{"text":"Ramen place located inside Whole foods plaza.  I had Tonkotsu black (garlic oil) with thick noodles. Noodle was good; broth was a bit too greasy and salty for me. It came with 2 slices of pork belly and one egg. Egg was a bit bland.  Service was fast and efficient to move people in and out.  There's usually a line up for dinner after 630pm on weekends."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of ramen in my life and while I can't say this place is my number one, it's pretty legit. I got the Tonkatsu black withe the black garlic oil. It really didn't come with much. Only ramen, 2 egg halves, muchroom fungus things and green onions. However, the broth was mildly rich that you can taste some of the fat cooked into it, but not overwhelming to where you're going to be sick. The soup was pretty light, but still seasoned enough so you can still taste all flavors. The ramen was cooked aldente, which is my favorite.   Overall, I had a pretty good experience and will definitely eat off hours again so I don't have to stand in a huge line."}
{"text":"Wow the ramen here are super tasty. If my stomach was bottomless I would have three bowls. If you need us have Japanese food ramen, come here and you will be satisfied. I will be coming back for more. Thank you!! For the delicious bowl of excellent soup."}
{"text":"Went around 6pm and the line was relatively short. The restaurant doesn't have a waiting area so the line starts outside on the street; they call on your party depending on the number of seats available inside.  Got the shoyu ramen base with thick noodles. Each bowl comes with slices of pork but I was able to substitute it for a side. The soup base was rich and thick and was not overpowering. Having just come back from Japan, it was comparable to the ramen I had overseas.   The gyoza chicken was thinly breaded and stuffed and seasoned well. Highly recommended in ordering it along with your ramen.  Overall, a good experience and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Being in an ideal location and having been to the location at Dundas street downtown, I was excited to try this place once again.  I went for lunch on a Saturday and waited about 30 minutes for a table for 4. This location is alot bigger than the one downtown and had more tables so I was surprised that I had to wait so long, but I was anticipating the ramen so I was patient.  Upon ordering, we were told that some soup bases were not available but it was prime lunch time which I did not understand. I was able to substitute the pork belly for a side. I wanted to order gyoza (a lightly battered and fried chicken dish) but they said that none of the sides were available during lunch. This frustrated me, especially after hearing that some of my party members were not able to order what they wanted to order.   Aside from that, the Shoyu and Tonkotsu ramen bowls that we ordered were rich and strong in taste. I give it a 3/5 due to the fact that half of the items on the menu were not available during prime lunch time on a weekend."}
{"text":"Party in the mouth, seriously. I read the reviews and luckily went for a late lunch around 3:30pm and didn't have to wait for a table. Ordered the black tonkatsu ramen and all I can say is it's unreal. It's the regular tonkatsu ramen finished off with maybe a garlic truffle oil on top. You choose either thin or thick noodles. The thick noodles were al dente texture just like pasta in italy and overall the entire dish was perfect for a cold winter day. The broth was truly the highlight of this dish and I can't wait to go back next time."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I have been going to Sansotei Ramen for about 10 years now (starting at the Downtown location).  I was so excited when they opened this Markham location, as I used to have to trek downtown to have this.  However, I notice that there is a taste difference here.  Somehow, this does not hold up to the locations downtown.  Despite this, it's my favourite ramen joint in Toronto.  I have eaten here enough to have tried all the ramen and most of the sides.    The best ramen to me is the Tonkotsu Black - it's flavourful and super garlic-y because of the black garlic oil.  I order this with thick noodles.  It has rapidly become my go-to since trying it.  Prior to the Tonkotsu Black, I ordered just plain Tonkotsu.  That was delicious as well.  I am not a huge fan of the Miso Black, Shoyu, Spicy Tantan or Tomato because the flavours just did not stand out to me.  The Tomato was decently good but it doesn't compare with the first two.    My favourite side to get is the Zangi.  It's great comfort food.    I have had their tofu cheesecake in the past, and it did not impress me.  However, I noticed that you can now have Millie's Patisserie cake.  That would be awesome if it's something that interests you.    All in all, this is a ramen joint I will continue visiting.  The food is pretty good, the service is okay and it's at a convenient location in the Whole Foods plaza in Markham."}
{"text":"Cold nights call for something warm and filling. What better place than to visit sansotei ramen.  Ordered the spicy miso black with extra chashu. The broth was flavourful, chashu or pork belly wasnt tender as i thought it would. Overall it was good but not really the best ive tried, was expecting something a little bit more spicier. Id come back again but ask for something with a little more spice.  The decor and environment was pleasant as there were ropes draped along the ceiling. The service was great as the waitresses/servers were knowledgeable, friendly and were quick"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of ramen but wanted to try this since I am in the neighbourhood. The restaurant is kind of spacious while compare with other ramen restaurant downtown, the food was good enough , but nothing stands out. I like that I can ask less oil and less salt for the soup. The waitress only understand very basic English. I would only go back if I crave for ramen since it is closer than going downtown."}
{"text":"I like this place over Kenzo. The shop is more intimate and I feel the ramen quality is better. Their miso ramen is $9.50."}
{"text":"O. M. Gee  this is some delectable Ramen!   I had the tonkatsu with thin noodles and extra veggies- it's all in the rich and delicious umami broth for this one! Great lunch spot and did not wait too long in the mid afternoon.  The egg and pork were also perfectly cooked and seasoned additions in this Ramen bowl.  Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Finally Toronto is getting more Ramen choices and being a big fan of Kinton (see my post here), I just have to try out their newly open competitor just down the street at 179 Dundas St. W. ' Sansotei Ramen recently open in a rather quite fashion, after hearing some friends said it was the best yet and being the ramen fans that we are, we just had to try it out.   It's a rather small space but I have been hearing how their broth is sold out all the time. We arrive for a late Friday lunch at around 2:30pm and the place was empty (yeah no wait) Very simple menu   Zawgi (Deep Fried Chicken) $4.50 It was good with a dash of spices on top  and I am guessing it was Shichimi togarashi (aka seven Flavor Chilli Pepper )    Tonkotsu Ramen $9.25 Look at the milky pork bone broth and it smells so good that I probably never took pictures of my food so quick. The soup was very flavorful, not too oily and have a very nice texture and this is definitely my fave ramen broth in Toronto but the noodle could be better.  The egg was actually perfectly cook but somehow I find it lack depth of flavor  The noodle here are white, unlike most places where food coloring is added to get that yellow color that we are use to (it's not egg, egg are not use to make ramen).   Unlike most Toronto ramen place where curly noodle is use, the one here are straight...but color or not, I find the noodle here are a bit hard and floury. Their ramen is the chef own but due to space issue, they are made by n outside contractor/factory.    Shio Ramen $8.90 (extra Chashu/Pork Belly +$2.00) A regular bowl of ramen here comes with 2 slices of chashu and for an additional of $2.00, you get another 2 pieces. A clear broth is use here instead with soy sauce added to it. I find this slightly saltier than the tonkotsu that I had and tasted slightly oilier but very tasty nonetheless.   I actually love the layers of fat on the chashu/pork belly which was a beauty and melt in your mouth goodness with a slight chew from the skin.  Green Tea Ice Cream Mochi $3.00 Love it, the ice cream wasn't frozen solid with a thin mochi layer.  Verdict :  the ramen and  how there's no line up yet Wish the noodle was better but love the broth and chashu/pork belly here."}
{"text":"Sansotei does a fantastic Tonkotsu ramen for a very good price. The pork broth is very rich and delicious and the noodles are great. The gyoza were also good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The first time I ever came to this restaurant was after waiting about 20 minutes in pouring rain, because this little hallway of a ramen place was full, and had no standing space for waiting customers-to-be. It turned out to be somewhat worth it in the end, but I didn't really appreciate the incredibly damp beginning.  The second time I came here was with a friend on a sunny day, after an hour or so of skating at Nathan Phillips Square. This was the only popular ramen joint I knew in the area, and had tried before, so we shuffled over in the cold for a bowl of hot Tonkotsu Black ramen.  I am a huge lover of garlic, and so I was only a little taken aback by the pungent garlic in this ramen. The meat was great, the noodles were good, and the broth was okay, but it was all incredibly salty, especially as you neared the end of the bowl.   The service is mildly attentive, and the only downside to a restaurant smack in the downtown core like this one was the fact that it's basically a glorified hallway. I really don't understand the huge hype over this restaurant, however, as it doesn't have many options, nor is it very memorable. I believe the wait times for this place can simply be attributed to the tiny amount of seating they actually do have, which is cozy but can sometimes get awkward when someone's watching anime on an iPad one seat away from you without any earphones in.  tl;dr: If you're a ramen enthusiast, check this one out. It's not on my faves list, as I favour Ajisen over it, but it's of reasonable quality and worth a try after a visit to Eaton's or the like."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday at 2 pm. It was pretty full, but no line up at the time.  Ordered Tonkatsu ramen, which tasted great, but not a healthy meal! There were no vegetables, and the soup was very creamy and salty. The 2 pork slices had 50% fat.  So in essence, it'll taste great, just be sure to balance your meals with your own fruits and vegetables afterwards."}
{"text":"Soup is creamy and well balanced. Noodles are fresh. Meat is soft, juicy and fat! Awesome bowl of ramen!"}
{"text":"Zero vegetarian options, so I couldn't eat anything."}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend here for dinner one Monday night around 5:45, and anxiously rushed over from my office expecting to wait outside for awhile before getting a table. To my surprise, there was no line and my friend and I were seated right away. Since it was my first time here, I ordered the the classic tonkotsu with thin noodles. It looked kinda small when it arrived so I was worried I wouldn't be full, but I was stuffed and couldn't finish the last bite! The broth was so good, pork belly was delicious and I loved the texture of the noodles. My friend got the spicy tan tan, and really liked that too.   The restaurant is quite narrow and cozy, and you'll probably end up sitting at a table with strangers. We sat next to a couple who ordered the chicken karaage, which smelled amazing. I'm definitely getting that next time! The servers are extremely friendly and nice too. Our water glasses were never empty, plus they didn't pressure us to leave even after we had finished eating. Maybe that's because it was a slower night and there was no line outside?  Ramen is one of my favorite things to eat ever, and Sansotei definitely does it well! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here almost once every two weeks, atmosphere is great, line up is just long, there's usually a wait. I like the original, but now I'm in the process of ordering from top down, and I haven't been disappointing yet. Portion is just right, pork are so tender, soup base is good. The last time I went, I was so focus on my ramen, completely ignoring my friend. It's that good!  Just take me away!"}
{"text":"Very straightforward ramen place. Ramen was flavorful and salty as it should be. The black garlic oil was pungently good. I will become a regular if I live in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen place in the world. Seriously.  I'm from California and I visit Toronto once a year on my work trip. While I'm here, I eat at this restaurant multiple times because it's that good. I found this restaurant because of top food media/blogger networks and I totally support their recommendation.   Okay okay.... I've only had the Tonkatsu Black Ramen. BUT it just hits the spot! The deep savory broth, the charred pork belly, the delicate soft boiled egg, the fresh pieces of mushroom and green onions, the chewy think noodles - all marry together in perfect harmony. I promise that if I do visit the 6 again in the future, then I will order the other kinds of ramen. Other stuff that you should definitely order is the kangi chicken and the gyoza as well.   This American will be back to Canada to have this Japanese dish. Yeahhhh it's pretty crazy on how far  I'll travel for food."}
{"text":"After living in Japan, finding real ramen that tastes good has been very hard. This was perfect! We stopped here on our first day in Toronto. I could have died and gone to heaven after that meal!! My husband and I both had the Tonkatsu ramen and it was amazing! He ordered extra of everything and I just had the standard bowl. It is so filling and delicious! It made me feel just like I was back in Japan.  The wait staff greets everyone with the Japanese welcome of \"Irashimasen!\" It was so great!! The meal was cheap and filling. Always important to us when we are on vacation. Best ramen we had in the city hands down!"}
{"text":"This is one of the top ramen places in Toronto right now. Love their black garlic oil version. I've been more than once for a weekday lunch and always get a seat right away."}
{"text":"3.5/5 for this ramen joint. I enjoy their noodles, meat, and egg however their broth can sometimes be too salty"}
{"text":"Came to Sansotei Ramen with my sister on Sunday night around 7:30, wait isn't too long around 15 mins.  We've ordered Tonkotsu black with thick noodles, dumplings and Fried chicken.  Portion of the ramen is just right, but I personally think the garlic oil flavor isn't strong enough, thick noodle is al dente which is good and the egg very good. ( very soft and egg yolk is liquid). However the 2 pieces of porkbelly that came with the ramen has a very unpleasant pork smell.... By adding .75 for extra bamboo shoot isn't worth it cos they don't really give u a lot.  Dumplings are too oily and fried chicken is just average nothing special."}
{"text":"Pretty decent ramen , same level as Santouka Ramen. proper price with proper ramen!!!"}
{"text":"Apart from Kinton, Raijin and Hokkaido Ramen Santouka are here now!!  As I said, earlier much bigger players are entering the market!  It's more than catering to a select few who enjoy only fatty soup and fatty pork.  Where is your response to your customers concerns?  Where is your website, your blog, your facebook page?  I am still disappointed by my experience here and the poor attention to the customers waiting on the sidewalk.  I have no reason to return to Sansotei now, with all the other quality ramen places I can select from in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"over all was average, not particularly special. The soup is a little bit too oily for me. The ramen came with an egg, two pieces of fatty meat. I think it is not very balanced diet for the people who want to have more fiber or veggi, and it is not cheap, plus tax and tips, over $12 for not getting satisfied meal."}
{"text":"I ordered tonkotsu ramen with thin noodles and it was so delicious! The noodles were perfectly cooked; just a tad chewy with none of that soggy, overcooked nonsense. The broth was very rich with flavour, but after a while it was too salty for my liking. To be fair, I am a very bland girl. The pork was perfectly seared, and the eggs were cooked so they were a tad yolky.  The wait wasn't long, in fact, I walked right in. I am definitely trying the black tonkotsu next time!"}
{"text":"The best ramen I've ever had! I have tried a lot of ramen places in Toronto and I always end up coming back to Sansotei. Their Black Tonkotsu (with thin noodles) is the best! The broth is delicious with so much flavour! Only minor thing I don't like is that the space is smaller than average with tight seating. It can get a little noisy and you have to sit close to other people (not good for those who want a quiet dinner date).   A MUST/go-to if you are visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"What can i say.... i really don't  claim myself to be a ramen connoisseur,  however, i know what i like.  And i really really like the tonkotsu black ramen with garlic oil.  It came in a decent sized bowl with pork slices and an egg.  My friend recommended that i request for reduced salt, and i am glad that i did.  The soup was very flavorful, and i loved the garlicky taste.  There was a choice between thin and thick noodles, so i went for my usual thin.  The noodles were smooth textured which i liked.  Overall, i would definitely go back to try their other items."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  The ramen portion is good for lunch assuming you had some breakfast.  Otherwise I suggest you eat cake (and I would recommend trying the Sakura mille crepe cake).  Anyway first off the first time I came here, like the time I went to their Markham branch.  I got hit with the MSG feels.  However... I decided to give them one more chance.  Why?  Because I had a sneaking suspicion the source of the MSG is the same as Kinton Ramen a few blocks south of here.  The seasoned egg.  Today I decided to order the tonkotsu ramen without the egg to test my theory.  As luck would have it no MSG feels.  Awesome.  Now I can give this place the 5-star rating it deserves because the service and ramen tastes pretty good.  For lunch it is actually quite satisfying unless you plan to work on developing type-2 diabetes and overeat.  The mille crepe was a bit bleh for the price I have to admit but I didn't factor that into the rating.  I think it has the same problem as Mille Cafe up in Markham where they do not make the cake in the store (at the time of my review of that place) and that it is pretty much staying in the fridge and collapsed and have their creme filling less than stellar.  However, it's a good enough but overpriced dessert to fill you up after if you skipped breakfast.  I think if they gave the crepe cake with a free small coffee it would make it more worthwhile.  Good thing Timmy's is just a few blocks down on the way to work."}
{"text":"In short: Service was good, taste was good. price was okay.  Would've been five stars if it wasn't for the MSG restriction I had.  I had the black tonkatsu which is tonkatsu with black garlic oil (not squid ink).  The MSG level isn't too bad, just a slight numbness for me.  It seems more like one of the ingredients or mixes they had used had MSG.  Much like Casa Manila used to have in their tamarind soup (sinigang).  The waitress we had had a \"perky attitude\" which is why I actually enjoyed my time there and wait as well.  The eggs were the way I liked them on my ramen.  The noodles were aldente'd just right.  The broth overall was okay, but it didn't feel refreshing enough to drink all the way down.  So overall still not a match for Niwatei in terms of being my overall favorite, but it is MUCH cheaper.    This place had very little choices (which is a good thing IMO), but with the establishment of MSG in the foo  I don't think I'd go here again by choice for a while, instead I'll give Juu-ban another try since there's more choices with no MSG."}
{"text":"I came for lunch on a weekday and was seated promptly. It was comfortable enough in comparison to other ramen places and I had enough space to put my jacket on the bench as well. My colleague and I ordered the Spicy Tan Tan and Tonkotsu Black.   The Spicy Tan Tan was good and more mild than what I expected. The egg was made perfectly and was probably my favourite part of the dish. Portion size is decent and I wasn't able to finish my ramen. I loved the taste of the Tonkotsu Black that my colleague ordered. I think it had just the right amount of flavour with a little kick of spice. What I didn't like about Sansotei's ramen is their broth. I felt that it could've been more rich and flavourful. It felt like it was lacking something.  I was very excited for dessert ever since we sat down and saw the sign for the Black Sesame Millie Crepe Cake. We ended up ordering one to share even though I wanted one slice all to myself! I'm so glad we ended up sharing because I was not a fan. I was craving the the taste of black sesame; maybe I had my expectations set too high. It was very creamy (almost too creamy) and I couldn't taste the black sesame at all. I honestly wouldn't have been able to tell that it was supposed to be black sesame just by the taste.  I would return for the ramen but I wouldn't order dessert again. At least not a millie crepe cake!"}
{"text":"This is a firm favourite. I find their soup to be the best because it's super flavourful and not too greasy. I'd recommend getting the tonkotsu - every time I tried something else I wish I stuck with the classic - and getting thick noodles. (I recently tried the tantan, Hokkaido scallop, and black garlic oil tonkotsu - and none of them can best the classic tonkotsu!) I think this is the best ramen in the city!"}
{"text":"Dined on a snowy, Friday night and thankfully got seated in less than ten minutes. I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen with thin noodles. The broth was rich and milky, the noodles were chewy, the egg was perfect, and the pork chasiu was savory but a little gummy texture-wise.   I loved the ambiance and decor. Very clean, geometric, and classy with the signature big ropes on the ceiling. The music was also soft, Japanese pop that played subtly in the background which I much prefer than loud house jazz music.   Service was super friendly and professional.   Overall, I give a 4.5 out of 5!"}
{"text":"My favorite ramen hang out. Rich but not too salty soup, balanced and chewy noodles, tender and flavorful pork, and an amazing egg. Can't go wrong with miso ramen."}
{"text":"Sansotei is my favourite ramen restaurant in Toronto. Been to the downtown and Markham locations as well and I would say the quality and taste of the ramen at this location matches the downtown one!   My go-to is the Tonkatsu Black and this time I added extra noodle, chashu, and egg cus I'm extra like that. The broth is rich and flavorful, the egg is perfectly runny, and I love the texture of the black fungus. Also, team thick noodle.   If you're in the Finch station area and you're looking for ramen, Sansotei is the place to be."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite ramen place ever, and I've eaten a ton of ramen in LA and Japan. I really love their tonkotsu broth - it's full of porky flavor and not so fatty that it makes me feel sick after. The egg is always perfectly cooked, and the pork belly is charred just right. The noodles are always on point as well - my only small critique is that they could maybe add another noodle type (maybe slightly thicker or a flat noodle).  Service is always friendly and efficient as well!"}
{"text":"4 stars lowered to 3.5 stars solely because of having to wait. Arrived 8:30 on a Saturday night and needed to wait about 15 minutes for a table for two. Not a problem because I expected it and it would be stupid to blame them for being so popular but personally, I would never go to a restaurant occasionally, or even rarely when there is an expectation to wait. I was only looking to try Sansotei once. The waitress responsible for taking care of the line of customers was very efficient and friendly. Menu was limited to a small sheet of paper which can be found on their website. I do not have any qualms about that since I think it helps customers decide what they want to eat faster. I ordered the Tonkatsu Black, Tofu Cheesecake and Gyu Don.   Pros: I hate the overuse of salt in typical ramen establishments and I was pleased to be able to drink some of the broth when I usually find it too salty/strong. I really liked the hint of garlic oil. It was not overpowering the other flavours of the broth.  The black fungus and egg that came with the ramen were both excellent.  Service exceeded my expectations for it being so busy. They have a lot of staff for such a small place.  Cons: The thin noodles suck. The thick ones are OK.  The portion sizes are small but of course you have the option of ordering extra noodles and sides.  Chashu quality at other ramen establishments are better."}
{"text":"Finally got to try their ramen on my fourth visit (sold out of either noodles or broth the first three visits).  We ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen was very good at first taste but seemed to get saltier as the meal went on.  Sot boiled eggs and pork were both cooked to perfection.  Overall a very good meal, just a bit on the salty side.  Funny aside, if I had not known better I would have guessed they were selling Chatime bubble tea there as well just based on the amount of customers that had a drink.  I'm guessing they don't frown on that as the first time I came to visit the owner had a Chatime of his own lol.  Next time we visit, we'll be sure to do the same as it looked like a really good combination :)"}
{"text":"Got there around 10:15pm, luckily there was no line and one table left. After the food was ordered, a line had already formed at the entrance of the door. The waitress was really friendly and always smiling.  The zangi (fried chicken) was delicious, moist inside and well seasoned outside. Choice of thin or thick noodles, ordered one of each to try. The soft boiled egg was perfect, with a runny yolk and soft egg whites. The chashu was a thick cut piece and very tender. Both broths were a little on the saltier side. Top choice would be the tonkatsu black, pork bone broth with black garlic oil. The thick noodles were definitely the better choice, it had a better texture and just felt more satisfying to slurp up.  Overall, if the wait isn't crazy will definitely go back for ramen."}
{"text":"Great uptown location so it's convenient to get our ramen fix. I've always been a fan of Sansotei, and their noodles are pretty consistent with their downtown location."}
{"text":"Nothing special to write home about here.  It's much like a bunch of other places that have opened up all over the GTA.  For me, Ramen needs to have a great broth and noodles that have a slight chewiness to them.  My friend and I ordered the tonkatsu ramen - he had his black.  We also order the gyoza and karaage.  Oh...also the Sapporo - why not, it looks like Sapporo bought every Ramen house's beer taps.  The broth was not too salty but I found it really too rich and fatty.  The noodles didn't have the consistency I expected either.  It's funny how some of the reviews state that it's too salty and then other reviews can state that it isn't.  Besides individual tastes, it could be due to inconsistencies between cooks - each have their own taste buds.  They might try use a recipe.  The gyoza was nothing too squawk about.  I think I have the same one in my freezer.  The Karaage (fried chicken) was ok - it doesn't scream fresh and juicy...just dry and underwhelming.  I'm with my Yelp friends on this...3 stars at best.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wow! Yum! We ordered the Tonkatsu Black with thick noodles & the Spicy Tan Tan with thin noodles - both were absolutely amazing. I preferred the Tan Tan broth, but the thick noodles. The gyoza & zangi were also SO yum!  Perfect for the gross, snowy, cold weather! The service was also incredibly fast - we were in and out in about 45 minutes but didn't feel rushed at all!"}
{"text":"Great to go solo. Skip the line and find a seat at the bar.  I probably sat, ordered, ate and paid in about 12 minutes total!  Great noodles and flavourful broth without being too salty."}
{"text":"oh wow. if it were my choice, i'd have been here every night to throw down some ramen while in toronto. this sparsely decorated restaurant offers limited seating choices, most being shared tables. if you like your privacy, arrive early.  the ramen noodles -- i had it thick and ordered extra -- is cooked perfectly. the soup/broth/whatever was seasoned well (had the miso). enjoyed it quite a lot. the gyoza and fried rice ... good but nothing extraordinary. you can tell where their passion is. reasonably priced, around $10 a bowl.  some might be put off by the menu choices (very limited for those that don't want noodles) so keep that in mind. luckily, there's a korean restaurant right next door. ;-)  tip: pay attention. you'll walk right past it if you don't. it's about the width of a driveway."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews here, I HAD to visit. I work pretty closeby, but I didn't start walking there until 1:10ish. I knew it'd be packed during lunchtime. So we arrived at 1:20, there was just one group in front of us. We waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready (table for two).  There are a total of four choices... Four ramen soup choice: - Tonkotsu (pork bone?) $9.25 - Miso $9.50 - Shio $8.90 - Tonkotsu shoyu $8.90  Plus your choice of thin, thick, or original (not thin not thick) ramen  Sides/extras like egg for $1, edamame $3.  My companion and I both ordered the tonkotsu with thin noodles. The soup was amazing, it came with fatty pork skin (so yummy, actually tastes like roasted duck), black fungi (it's good, promise), one egg. It's VERY filling, for $9.25 it's sooooo worth it. It took a while to finish eating it.  This place is extremely small, it only seats about 20-30 people max. I don't feel at all crammed though, there were lots of space between tables and people. AND they have amazing food, clean, service is great. It's no wonder there's a lineup all the time.   Around 2ish,there was a lineup of 8 people, but when we left at 2:30 there were no lineups."}
{"text":"Pretty decent - probably the best ramen offering available in Markham currently.  Date visited: September 17, 2015.  Items ordered: Black Tonkotsu Ramen with thin noodles Zangi (deep fried chicken thigh)  Pros  + Good ramen (egg was softboiled and marinated nicely; wood ear provided a good bite; pork was well roasted and had a good meat/fat ratio although overcooked marginally; stock was flavourful without being overly salty; ramen noodles were soft yet springy)   + Good zangi (very tender, seasoned nicely, had a slight gingery taste to it that provided contrast in flavours)  + Comfortable atmosphere (not too loud; comfortable seating although groups of 3-4 may be paired with other groups of 3-4 as tables of 8 exist)  Cons  - Service, while good, is slow (mainly due to understaffing today most likely as it's the opening date)  - Food took a while to arrive (again, could be understaffed on chefs)  - Long lineups (likely due to opening date hype)  - Reservations CANNOT be made (contributes to the point above)  Conclusion:  The food is good although the service can be slow at times and the food takes a while to arrive. This should likely improve in the upcoming weeks."}
{"text":"Was there for a quick lunch today. It was pretty busy so there was a line-up....OUTSIDE. After 5 minutes of freezing our asses off, we got a table and ordered a miso and a shio ramen. The broth was great, better than Kinton but the noodles itself were worse than Kinton's.  It was ok but not sure if it was the oiliness of the broth but my stomach has been off since lunch."}
{"text":"Was craving ramen, this place was closest and reviews seemed decent.  +clean +fast service +lots of staff on hand, organized +affordable, nothing crazy expensive  -ramen overall just not that great tasting -char siu isn't nice and tender like other places, hard and chewy -boiled egg not liquidy like other places -a bit overly salty overall  -noodles on the harder rubbery side, I like when ramen noodles are chewy but soft, not hand made as I saw them pull them out of bulk wholesale bags  Overall: 2/5 stars, and would likely NOT return.  Update: had a business lunch meeting and my guests wanted ramen. Decided to come back and the quality is much better than my first trip, updating my review to reflect this. 4/5, solid ramen especially for this area."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen, to say the least! I'm not necessarily a ramen Jedi but I do my best to try lots of different restaurants. I remember coming here several years ago, on my first visit to Toronto, and went back for more on my second visit last month! The service was friendly and the food was delicious! I'd love to go back next time!"}
{"text":"Great ramen place, we came for dinner when we came to visit Toronto. We had great service and our noodles came pretty quickly. WE would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Best tonkotsu ramen in the city, the noodles are perfectly chewy and the egg cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Ramen is very good, the broth is very tasty, noodle are perfect. We wait few minutes outside at -20 but it totally worth it. My son of 6yo ask me to go back there, he loves it. The place is small and very crowded but it's very fast, you order, enjoy then go."}
{"text":"So after eating at Sansotei twice, here are my thoughts:  Go for the tonkotsu ramen.   I felt SUPER full after each meal there and to be honest, my stomach didn't feel all that great afterwards but I have a bit of a sensitive stomach to lots of oil and salt, which makes ramen something I should probably stay away from in general.   The egg is a hit or miss.. the first time I went, it was amaaaazing. nicely cooked outside and a good runny egg yolk inside. I think I sang it's praises to everybody the next day. The second time I went, it was cold, which is a big complaint I had heard from other people.   The pork is really nicely layered with a thick layer of meat and layer of fat that literally melts in your mouth.   If you're going as a pair, it's very probably that you'll have to share a table with other people.The place is small, much too small for the number of people who want to eat there so I would suggest going there by 5:30 unless you want to wait outside!"}
