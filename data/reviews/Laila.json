{"text":"After a night out at Lee's Palace or the Bloor Cinema, this small yet accommodating Middle Eastern restaurant has all the comforts you need - from shish taouk to chicken shawarma, felafel to baba ganoush, Laila serves delicious plates and sandwiches at reasonable prices and are open until late late late."}
{"text":"Something's up with Laila.  Girl... what's wrong?  I mean, she's still great and all, but to a much lesser extent than she once was. There's a certain warm element of passion for what they do, that hasn't necessarily disappeared, but has definitely been dumbed down.  My friends and I used to passionately refer to Laila as our \"Homegirl on the South Side\"... but as of late, she's just Laila.  Anyway, if you never knew her before, she's still pretty dope. A large plate of food for under ten bucks.  My favourite part about Laila is that the chicken feels like it's actually (almost) chicken - this is a big issue I have with most of the other Lebanese spots in the area.  Another star for carrying JUMEX in the fridge!!!.. mmm... Guanabana!  If you're a lover of Lebanese and you've got an appetite, stop over for a meal at Laila.  Hopefully your visit is on a \"South Side\" kinda day."}
{"text":"I tried this place on the good reviews and because Ghazale & Sarah's falafel in the same vicinity are severely overrated (see http://www.yelp.ca/list/you-are-severely-overrated-yes-you-overrated-toronto)  Unfortunately, I cannot share my fellow reviewers' positive ratings.  I ordered the falafel sandwich (my standard order) and I was disappointed.  I give it props for being freshly fried (which Ghazale and Sarah's DOESN'T do).  but nothing about the falafel balls were crispy.  They were a bit mushy and the flavour of the entire thing was rather lacking.  I'm sad to give it poor reviews because the lovely woman behind the counter was oh-so nice and brought my order right to my table after I paid.  BUT at least there is PLENTY of comfortable space to sit and it is nice an air conditioned.  I just wish I had a better experience with the food.  If you are dying for a falafel then go ahead and come here- it certainly beats the gross sweaty lineups at Ghazale and the lacklustre interior of Sarah's.  But don't expect the food to be any better."}
{"text":"I tried their falafel plate and it's decent value for money but the falafel balls themselves weren't great. The sides were tastier, especially the hummus, but I'm disappointed thus far on my quest to find Toronto's best falafel. College Street Falafel was a real let-down. I'm accustomed to eating only the most delicious of falafels at Maoz locations across the Netherlands. I can't describe how delicious Maoz falafels are. Some days I'm really craving a falafel and get depressed that I'm in Toronto..."}
{"text":"People are all about Lailas, but I can honestly say this is the worst food I have ever had in Toronto.  Maybe it used to be good...but wow.  I dont know why anyone would go here...ever.  Pita was stale, shawarma looked like it had been sitting out for hours (days?)...most of the sandwich was cucumber.  The surly woman behind the counter looked pissed off that I was even there.  The combination of horrible food plus horrible service would make me never want to go back.  Ever."}
{"text":"Laila is probably my favorite Middle Eastern place in Toronto. For under ten dollars you can get a filling meal and a drink. Both the shawarma and falafel are great and reliably filling. I haven't explored much further into the menu but that mostly because I like the shawarma and falafel so much.  The food is not the only good thing about this place. The inside is much nicer than your average cheap restaurant and actually feels very comfortable with plentiful seating. It's also open late so you can come here after seeing a movie at the Bloor Cinema across the street or a night out drinking with friends.  When I'm craving Middle Eastern this is the place I go."}
{"text":"WORST SHAWARMA EVER!!! I love shawarma, and have eaten shawarma across four continents.  I walked into laila's with my husband and asked for two shawarma sandwiches, one sheesh tawook sandwich, and one taboulah salad. What we got was nothing that can even closely resemble a shawarma, let alone an edible sandwich. The stale pita wrap was so empty, and there were 5 pieces what appeared to be some form of protein with grill/char marks on it on top of a sprinkle of shredded lettuce.  On first bite, I realized that the only thing this protein-looking thing could be was probably dried-out 2-week old discarded donkey meat.  Not that I know what donkey meat tastes like but this would certainly qualify.  You know how in Rome or South Korea they say that \"everything tastes like chicken\", even if you suspect it to be cat or dog meat.  Well this did not taste anything like chicken.  I have never in my life seen a sandwich of any kind this bad, and it certainly had nothing to do with shawerma or chicken for that matter.  No chicken meat, no shawarma spice, no flavor, no juiciness, no garlic in the garlic paste.  The only think I tasted was the charred grill taste it probably picked up from the grill.  All this aside, I truly believe that Toronto public health should check this place out, as I am almost certain there were some serious violations to that sandwich in front of me.  It was soo bad that we just got up, put our coats on, and left the place.  We were speechless, and it is hard to complain when something is just this wrong.  If we hadn't paid for the food upfront on the counter I would have certainly wanted the old owner sitting on the side of the counter to call Toronto Police - this would have been my chance to formally collect evidence of my anticipated food-poisoning.  God help us tonight with that bite we ate, we did not wrong anyone today."}
{"text":"So after being disappointed at Ghazale, I decided to try out the falafel across the street here...Needless to say it was leaps and bounds better! They had pickled turnip, lots of toppings, the falafel was crunchy, and it was served in a thicker style pita. My only complaint about this place is charging extra for hummous, something that should definitely be coming with any type of falafel sandwich!  Also, I have it on good authority from an Israeli source that Laila deserves props for their falafel...forget Ghazale and come here!"}
{"text":"for under ten bucks i had a great falafel plate.   FINALLY JESUS CHRIST!  the falafels were crispy, covered with tehina, and surrounded by fluffy saffron rice, moujadara (rice, lentil and onions), hummous, tabouli salad and israeli salad.  i could have gotten pita instead of the rice and i would have considering the fact that i was delighted to finally see a soft, fluffy pita - one that you slice the top off of and you now have a thick, chewy pocket to fill with middle eastern goodness.  well goodness gracious me i enjoyed it and i didnt know where to start. (thats a lie i went right for the salad. - always have to make sure i eat it first otherwise ill likely fill myself up with the stuff i really want.)  when i was done i took my tray up to the counter (though the owner brought me my dinner, it wasnt much of a waiter service place. you order at the front and either take it to go or sit down and stare at the teevee.) and the owner said, \"thanks, dear.\" i felt like saying \" i love you mum, see you later.\"  i feel like i should say ah shucks right now.  ah shucks.  the decor had a nice red middle eastern feel to go with the sign out front, but come here for the quick fresh cheap and tasty food."}
{"text":"I will give Laila 5 stars for the joy it brought to my life - but I am sad to say I went by today and it was closed, with a for lease sign in the window.  Such a shame.  :("}
{"text":"Very slow service.  Seems like they were understaffed with one poor soul doing everything.  The food was a tad overpriced imo, nearing 10 bucks for a plate of food.  That being said, I thought the food was very delicious and tasty.  The combination of rice, salad, tabouli, hummus and chicken made for a great tasting meal.  I did, on two occasions, chew on that nasty burnt charcoal chicken that you get from the grill which I wasn't a fan of at all, but overall the meal was very satisfying."}
{"text":"Laila is a hidden gem! My love for this place is endless and I feel like not enough people know about it.   The shwarmas and falafels are no-brainers, delicious and fresh everytime. The fries made-to-order make a great side, and they also offer other options like burgers, or rice platters. The prices are relatively inexpensive and you can get a filling meal and drink for around 7 dollars.   It seems like it might be family owned and the service is excellent. Major Bonus? It's open really late! I'm not sure of the exact hours but I know I've stumbled in there a little tipsy post 3 am for sure. Sometimes after the bar all you need is a shwarma!   Also if you really feel like sitting and eating there are chess sets and a television to keep you amused :)"}
