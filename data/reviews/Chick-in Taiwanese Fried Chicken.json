{"text":"We are a fan of Taiwanese Fried Chicken but this place is definitely below average. The chicken was not crispy, rice was too soft, the preserved veggie on the side was soggy. 
And few hours later, both my husband and I had stomachache :("}
{"text":"This is a 3 stars place. The food is just OK. Its also pretty expensive, just getting fried snacks and drinks for 3 ppl it was $60. I wouldn't complain about the prices if the food was better. 

The fried food is served on paper napkins instead of wax paper unlike in TW. The problem is the food tends to stick to the napkins and than is not easy to eat.

I recommend this place serve the food on wax paper or the paper bags they use in TW, so the oil gets absorbed, but the food doesnt stick to the kleenex, because no one wants to eat kleenex's. 

Also, the food doesn't have the proper seasonings, you need to add it yourself. I think they should deepfry garlic and the green basil with the food just like its done in TW. Otherwise, why come here if the food ain't the TW experience? 

The corn was not fresh, they need to improve the vegetable quality. I do like the large variety of options in this place."}
{"text":"love this free drink~grapefruit green tea, this place is good for snacks and the small size popcorn/yansu chicken is enough for one to two person, also their stewed beef noodle and 3 cup chicken is really good, definitely will go again"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a large group including children. Not quite sure what to make of the interior theme, it's a mishmash of modern, traditional and cafeteria! We sat on high benches at high tables. There were also high stools that you can add to the table for more seats. 

We had the special - short beef ribs with rice, and fried fish fillets with rice. Also ordered the pork cutlet bento, stewed beef bento, chicken cutlet bento and '3 cup chicken' bento. The waitress was patient and helpful, explaining the dishes to us. Prices range from $6.99-$8.99. 

The food came out quite fast but we were taken aback when cheap, plastic disposable cutlery was given to us. It was a challenge cutting up a pork cutlet placed over rice in a small plastic bento box with the thin plastic fork and knife. We asked for a pair of scissors in the end. The food didn't taste great, unfortunately, just average. I liked their pickled vegetable side that came with the beef ribs. The rice was cooked too soft, one friend had rice that was clumped together. The specials were served on big plates but sides eg fish balls, came in a takeout paper bag. 

The best thing we had was their tea drinks. I liked the roasted, caramelly flavour in the original black tea, both with and without milk. Their tapioca is soft and not overly chewy. The lychee slush was average. If you order their bentos, you can have a drink from a small selection for $1. For slush, it's $3 more. We thought it's $2 more but when the bill came, we found out it's $2 more on top of the $1. 

It wasn't a good first impression and it's not likely we'll be back. For the prices we paid we expect more than cafeteria-style dining."}
{"text":"Order 3 popcorn chicken rice and paid for it $9.99 each. End up telling me they don't sell popcorn chicken rice and gave me 3 bags of popcorn chicken.. Asked them what am I going to do with 3 bags of popcorn chicken without rice. She said I can pay for 3 bowls of rice. Refused to give me a refund.. Never going back! Food is not even that good!"}
{"text":"My experience eating at Chicken-in us mediocre at best. Firstly, the seating is far from comfortable - long wooden tables and wooden benches with no backs. Seeing as this is mainly fast food, this should not have been a problem except the food did not come quickly (contrary to a previous review). We came in on a weekday afternoon when there are only 2 other parties (one of them already done their food) and somehow food still took about 30 mins to arrive. 

Beyond this, the menu has a lot of options for fried anything in addition to chicken. Their fried items come in little paper bags you just eat out of - much like night market style. I'd much prefer my food at a restaurant to come on a plate. 

Luckily, the food itself was decent. Fried items were very hot and flavourful. Hopefully they develop a more attractive lunch combo menu (currently just 2-3 be to options) and increase the quality of their drinks."}
{"text":"Came after work for a late lunch/snack with a couple friends and I was pleasantly surprised! Had been trying to come here and try it out for the longest time, and just never made it until recently. 

The seats were definitely not comfortable as others mentioned, but it also wasn't as bad as stated either. The restaurant was rather dimly light though with an odd open kitchen concept. 

However, most of the food was quite good. We ordered a couple things for snacks and I got a bento box for some more food. The Popcorn Chicken was really well done, as most Taiwanese places overkill with the salt. This one was very tasty without it being overly salted. The Potato Wedges were very good as well, as well as the Lamb Skewer. The bento box I got was the 3 Season Chicken, but the flavour wasn't all there. It felt very rushed and a bit cheap. The price wasn't bad though, at $6.99 and an extra $1 for the drink. 

The service was quick and friendly, and they even gave us free chicken to taste as well. Not entirely sure what it was, but it was awesome. 

Definitely a great spot for a snack or two, but probably won't be getting the bento box again."}
{"text":"Was craving some fried chicken and saw this new location, so I thought we would stop by. 

The setup of this location was very strange. No real tables, and an open kitchen concept. The actual sitting area is more like parts of a bar. It is situated a little higher than regular seats and it feels like it was designed for multiple parties at one seat. Wasn't a fan as there may not have been privacy if you were on a date. 

I hated the open kitchen concept. It was loud at times and there was something (a machinery of some sort) that kicked in while we were having a conversation. It was loud and startled my date. Didn't like it. -1 star

The chicken was very good. I wouldn't say great, but very good. It reminded me of the chicken in Taiwan. The Taiwanese sausage was terrible. It was on the hot dog heating contraption, so it wasn't very hot to begin with. It was also self serve. That means that we had to do it ourselves. If I wanted a DIY snack, I would have stayed home. -1 star 

The drinks were very good. I like winter melon and the drink with winter melon and lemon was a very good combination. 

Overall, I would go back for the drink and the chicken. I would not recommend anything else."}
{"text":"Came here today to get 2 orders of the Yansu chicken.   The store has a weird setup, so I wouldn't really want to eat in.  The seating just seems like an afterthought.  The chicken was really fragrant and my kids said it was much better than Papa Changs.(actually had the basil leaves).  The price was $6.99 for a small order, not too bad.  But on reflection, it was $15.80 for around 1 chicken legs worth of meat.  Could get at least half a chicken from other places.  Supposed to be cheap street eats, after all.   Bento boxes are now all $8.99 with no drink, so it is a bit pricy. 

Would come back again to get the Yansu chicken for a snack but doubt I'd come to eat anything else.  Might try the drinks though."}
{"text":"My first taiwanese chicken experience was a good one.

Sought out a spot opened during lunch hours and was very happy with this find and will now be a regular customer.

The chicken is cut small like popcorn chicken and seems well seasoned and has a nice light soy taste giving it extra flavour. 

A must try if in the area."}
{"text":"Tried their fried chicken today - 9.99 before tax. It was decent - crispy and well seasoned but portion was fairly small. With 10 bucks, you could get equivalent amount of comparable quality Taiwanese fried chicken at cha me cha next door in their set meals which include veggies and rice. May come back to try their other fare but was not impressed enough by their chicken at this price point to make this a regular place for tfc.."}
{"text":"Chick-In has a lot of menu selections, mostly deep fried snacks, skewers, and they have a huge drink menu as well.

This is the place for you if you feel like eating something small and get a quick bubble tea.

The small size of Taiwanese YanSu Chicken was a fair enough portion size. The wait for food was a little big too long though.. and the server also took a long time to return my change after I paid.

Pack patience, and you will be fine.. I don't think I am coming back. I will try Taiwanese Chicken somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Very tasty food.  Tried the popcorn chicken bento and the minced pork rice.  Food came hot and very fast.  

Bubble teas were good as well.  Tapioca cooked just right.

As others have mentioned, more of a cafeteria concept.  You order your food, get your own stool at one of the long communal tables.  Was not too busy when we were there at 4pm, just 5 other customers.

But food was good and we would visit again.  Good place for quick meal but not for long chats."}
{"text":"The popcorn chicken was really salty. Next door at cha me cha serves better with bigger portions. I'm guessing based on the other reviews there is some inconsistency with their food here. I didn't really like it here, sorry :("}
{"text":"I ordered skewers, fried chicken leg and crispy rib bento. The fried chicken is breaded really well. The coating is crispy and a bit sweet, and the thickness is controlled to a proper level. The bento comes with vegetables, an soy egg, a bit of minced pork on top of rice, potato and the of course the deep fried ribs. The rib is prepared in exact same way as the fried chicken. So I would recommend getting either but not both. Skewers are horrible, it feels like chewing beef jerky."}
{"text":"Cheap eat.  Satisfied my Taiwanese food cravings for a low price.  Especially liked the drinks here as they weren't too sweet.  The food wasnt too salty like many other places, i felt it was perfect.  A must try.  For under $10 u can get a bento box and a drink."}
{"text":"The Yantsu chicken is definitely worth checking out if you're at this joint. I also ordered the fish fillet bento box and to be honest I was a bit disappointed , the fillet was a bit soft despite looking very fried and the the rice was pretty average too. The other reviews weren't lying when they said the drinks were good, I definitely recommend. Btw the yantsu chicken comes with a free drink (not of choice). And I definitely recommend this place as and small snack place with your pals!"}
{"text":"When we walked in and saw the layout of the place it was not really welcoming. There are two large wooden stool tables so they are like the height of bar stools. The seats are also made out of the same wood and I must say these are the most uncomfortable seats ever. 

I got a small black milk tea for $3.99 - I thought there is no way anyone could make a simple black milk tea wrong but this place is the first. It was so watered down that it tasted like water with some sugar. 

Also grabbed the small Taiwanese fried chicken $6.99 - it was served in a bag which was a turn-off but she did give us some spicies which you can sprikle over the chicken. I think the one I used was a garlic flavour which tasted pretty good. 

Another big turn-off was that there was an open garbage can right behind our table and you can smell all the garbage odors coming from it. I can really say only the chicken was good. I think this is more of a take-out type of place. I really don't know how they are going to survive with Cha Me Cha right next door offering the same stuff at the same price. 

I would say this place is more of a 2 star but I give it a sympathy 3 star because you can tell the owners are really trying. Hopefully they can improve on all the little hiccups they have."}
{"text":"Cute place, nice selection,  but you have to like deep fried food,  cos that's most of the menu."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, the fried chicken is here is sooooo awesome!!! I love the deep fried veggies they put in there too. They give me free Chinese ice tea too!!

Only problem is you can't eat this deep fried stuff all the time.. :("}
{"text":"Their grand opening was this past Wednesday but I'm not entirely sure that they're ready. There were no chairs or tables in the restaurant though there were lots of staff. The menu is limited to only the items highlighted on the menu and I'm guessing their future plans to provide quick dinners / snack food for the apartment and nearby suburbs. 

We got a large order of yansu chicken (Taiwanese fried chicken) but it's surprisingly very small - about the size of a large grapefruit for 10.15 after tax, part of which was made up of fried tofu. The chicken was good and hot and had lots of seasoning. Hopefully I see something more encouraging in the future. 

They speak cantonese, mandarin and accept cash and debit (credit only over $20)"}
{"text":"The service here is very good. I was the only customer in line as I was there between lunch and dinner on a weekday. I tried the Taiwanese chicken that they are known for. It is really good! Juicy and moist with lots of flavour on the outside. Did not find it overly salty or sweet.

The parking lot in this lot is very difficult to find a spot or park in. There are always so many cars waiting for people to leave and even though there is underground parking, this is also very full and can be hard to find a decent spot."}
{"text":"Weird little open concept kitchen... but a nice place for some taiwanese snacks in the area. Since they're known for their fried chicken cutlet and popcorn chicken, they might have some competition with Cha Mi Cha which is literally right next door. Compared with the setting, i might opt for their competitor since they do offer more comfortable seating and a more laid back ambience. The owner is really nice though; we sat on the bench and happen to have our legs hanging cuz there was nowhere to rest them on, so she gave us some stools under the table to rest them on :) Note: there are no individual seatings here, just all high, communal tables. 

Their menu might be a bit overwhelming at first since theyre all in individual laminated sheets and you're flipping through them to see what they all are, or which one is which. Could have been better if they just binded all that together. You'd expect the typical taiwanese food you see at other places, including bentos, rice, taiwanese sausages, and bubble tea. Their tapioca was a bit hard for my liking, not sure if they were undercooked or if this was their style. The fried chicken itself was pretty good, comes very fresh; crispy on the outside, tender and hot on the inside. Other than that... not much that attracted me to order, except a bento as more food. 

Tbh... not that this place is bad, but I might opt for places like Papa Chang instead. Considering they're still pretty new and people would check them out for now, they should really look into expanding their menu selection."}
{"text":"Meh I don't get it? Came here after reading the positive reviews but left which confusion and slight disappointment.

I was craving some taiwanese popcorn chicken, WHICH should be noted that it is called \"yan su\" chicken here, but ended up choosing a bento combo instead. BE WARNED that the pictures on the menu does not reflect what you actually get. I ordered a 14. braised minced pork bento combo and my friend ordered the 2. yan su chicken fried combo. All combos come with a selected choice of drink, but I saw another yelper's photo with the taro sundae and it looked so yummy, I asked to substitute my free drink for the sundae for an additional $2. When my drink came, it was basically just a taro bubble tea... where's the icecream? where was the taro stick--o??? When it didn't look like what was advertised, I clarified with the server and she just cut open the top packaging and topped it which a scoop of vanilla icecream. Pretty disappointing... I was also expecting a bento box meal like the neighbouring table's customer, but ended up with a minced meat rice bowl. The bowl also came with tofu (?) and some okra which I think was sitting too long (soggy)... My friend on the other hand, his meal came in a white takeout box with few chicken on the side but abundant white rice. Fried chicken tasted great though. Pricewise for the combos, I think they are good valued and well portioned. Presentation wise, it is lacking consistency. 

Located in the cha me cha plaza right beside Moral Village. First impression was: \"is this place even open?\" The OPEN sign was lit but the interior was dark, very few people were inside, and you need to use a little extra force to open the door. When I first entered with a friend, we picked an empty table and were \"greeted\" by a lady who just threw 2 paper take-out menus on the table even though we were dining in...  Layout, as mentioned, is strange as the building is deep rather than wide, so there are 2 long tables set up parallel to their open kitchen. Towards the back, the area is somewhat closed off as some people were still renovating/constructing (a waste bin) for the restaurant and moving stuff around. Interior and furnishing definetly still needs some work.

TLDR: Don't dine in; take-out maybe. Will probably go to neighbouring businesses for taiwanese popcorn chicken..."}
{"text":"Chick-in works like a Fast Food Joint with minimum table service.

Order and pay at the counter and the waitstaff will bring you the food.

Menu is quite extensive with a lot of deep fried snacks. They even have Bento Box lunch special ($6.99) which includes a drink, a great value. And of course their Fried Chicken specialty!

The deep fried items tasted fresh and crispy! 

The set up though a little strange and feels empty. The high table and stools are just really uncomfortable. Just maybe they can change those to something more comfy in the future."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Kindly note that I didn't consider pricing and value in the review, as I dined using a deal.

I got lucky.  I got lucky because I tried Chick-In using the Asia Food Fest deal.  The deal provided a good variety of dishes in a combo for 2 (and a huge variety for a combo for 4).  The Asian Food Fest deal came with a Taiwanese Pork Chop Bento, a Braised Pork Steam Rice, 5 tapas, and 2 beverages.  

Without going into details dish by dish, I would say I was delighted by the food in general. The pork chops especially shone through.  Make no mistake that these were fried food, yet they were fresh fry.  The batter was super thin yet tasty and crispy.  The flavour theme was salty, and you would taste it in a variety of twists dish after dish.  I felt like a beer to cleanse my palate near the end of the meal.

This is a nice, little eatery that is best appreciated in variety and in group.  I like certain dishes more than the others.  If you dine alone, go for the Taiwanese pork chops instead of the fried chicken.

Cash only."}
