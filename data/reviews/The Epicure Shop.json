{"text":"Unfortunately, I've tried giving this place a few chances to impress me. I definitely wish that they were friendlier in there and more willing to help. While they admittedly have a great selection of meats and cheeses the service is so poor and so rude that I just absolutely can't bring myself to go back.

If just looking to pick some things up to go, it's fine to go there, but definitely don't expect a smile or anyone knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Love the freshly made sandwiches here, delish!
Can be a bit hectic during lunch hour, which would probably be intimidating for a first timer, but once you get the hang of it, it's awesome.

Go earlier in the day if you want a fresh bun as they can run out pretty quickly.

I agree with some yelpers that the staff can be a bit surly at times, but overall they are really friendly and helpful. They would benefit from a different approach to serving during a rush."}
{"text":"I bought 3 dealfind coupons for this place back in 2010. I used 2 of them right away but misplaced the other one. I found it recently and since it specifically says \"NO EXPIRY DATE\" on it, I figured they must still honour it. But they don't. And dealfind would not give me a refund either, saying that the merchant had a legally binding contract to honour the expiry date. So now I'm out of the $25 that I originally paid for the coupon. 

When I called the owner of Epicure, and politely explained my situation and what dealfind had told me about the legally binding contract, she hung up on me! Horrible customer service all around. If you say no expiry date on the coupon, then you have to honour it (even 3 years after the fact)! The owner also tried to lie to me about how long it has been (she said 5 years, even though it's been 3) and about the cost of the original coupon (she said it's only $20, so why am I complaining - well no, it was $25 and I'm complaining because the business practice is really shady and misleading). Needless to say, I will never return."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Cabbagetown!  Also have a great selection cheeses, meats, coffee beans and variety other food items that you might need in a pinch.  These guys have been here forever and are always super friendly and helpful.  Definitely one of those neighborhood gems!"}
{"text":"I once was a daily customer of this shop for its breakfast specials and sandwiches until one of the employees told a co-worker of mine to \"shut her mouth\" and then told her to \"F--k off\". Never in my life have I witnessed such disrespect by an employee to a  customer. We spoke to the owner of the shop and she gave a half-hearted apology because she had to \"rush back to another customer's order\". Well, they lost my business and the business of everyone in our office. I would rather spend a few extra dollars at St. Jamestown Delicatessens (who has AMAZING food) than give this restaurant a nickel."}
{"text":"Great local business, feels like a New York style deli. Authentic service, authentic product."}
{"text":"Very friendly, helpful staff.  Top quality selection of ingredients. Reasonable prices. The menu boards are confusing, and the small shop can get busy, but if you just pick one of the breakfast sandwiches or signature sandwiches you won't be disappointed.  Pick your own bread from the bins, and they make it up for you.  Good coffee, nice homemade desserts.  Pick up a \"Bubba Sparx\" sandwich, a coffee and a lemon square, and walk over to Riverdale Park.  A homemade lunch in a lovely park watching farm animals is a great break from the busy city"}
{"text":"I'm quite biased, I grew up near this old world deli and spent many years munching on those delicious sandwich and bread, and when I moved back to Toronto for my grad studies, I was still living in Cabbagetown. To say this place holds many of my memories will be an understatement.

 Cheese, Ham, salad, and peameal on Rye, a meal for under $4.50. an extra dollar for the coffee. What's not to like? They also have a great price for deli meats, good bread and cheese. A special mention for their homemade baba ganoush, which is deliciously velvety. I miss this place dearly since I moved back to Montreal."}
{"text":"This has become one of my go to places when making meat and cheese platters. They have Ace Bakery baguettes and breads which are always tasty accompaniments.
I've also used them for creating a big catered spread for me which was well received and had a nice presentation.

There is a small menu of breakfast and lunch sandwiches available as well as some prepared food like sausage rolls and stuffed peppers. Prices are okay, service is adequate, and I keep coming back so Yelps 4 star standard of \"being a fan\" defintely rings true."}
{"text":"The breakfast menu is the star of Epicure. The prices are great and it tastes homemade unlike Subways or Tim Hortons. The staff and owner are very friendly and helps you explain the menu or any other options you might like to grab. It's a very nostalgic and home-y store that all my coworkers love as well. I'm just worried that some of the packaged goods may have been sitting there for a long time but HEY, it's stroopwafels!"}
{"text":"These are the things you should know about The Epicure Shop.

1. The staff are tres friendly
2. It is a perfect local spot for gourmet treats (Pesto, pasta sauce, nice cheese etc)
3. They have fresh breads, a little hard to find around town sometimes so that is a winner.
4. They have a type of coffee called GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE and I don't care whether of not you like flavoured coffee this one is for you. More below...

Below - So you know the way you buy some coffee and you smell it and it smells so damn good. Then you make the coffee and it just tastes like coffee. We this stuff smells like chocolatey coffee heaven and tastes exactly as it smells. Everyone I know who has tasted it has fallen in love too. 

Go on, get yourself to The Epicure Shop and get some coffee. And you make that the German Chocolate Cake coffee."}
{"text":"Very friendly counter staff, blonde w overalls.  Nice small deli and bakery.
Adds to this stretch of Parliament.
Very good latte."}
{"text":"Went in this morning for the first time and was not disappointed. The staff was very friendly and kindly explained the process of ordering the breakfast sandwiches, which are fairly priced. Everything was fresh and absolutely delicious. Will happily return! :)"}
{"text":"My favourite sandwich shop.I crave for their Turkey sandwiches soo yummy . Recently they went for renovation looks beautiful."}
{"text":"I'm a Cabbagetown resident and haven't had the opportunity to check out this awesome little shop till today and it is awesome!

The fresh bread makes the sandwich... I order the Chicken Deluxe which great... The chicken was moist and tender and the fresh bread was soft... Patti was awesome in asking which garnishes I needed and prepared it on the spot...

Plus... they had buy one salad and get second for free day at Epicure so I got a nice side as well all for under 10 dollars...

Great lunch spot... Will come again!"}
{"text":"Cabbagetown needs, nay, DESERVES more spots like this. 

Lovely cheeses and meats and Italian and French extras to add to meals and parties. If you're shopping strictly in the hood (no time for the St. Lawrence market) you must stop here. You simply can't have a real meal built on FreshCo or No Frills alone. It's just wrong. ESPECIALLY since this place is hella affordable.

BIG BONUS: Grab one of their pastries or bagels and they will make you a lovely breakfast sandwich with local and organic ingredients for under $4."}
