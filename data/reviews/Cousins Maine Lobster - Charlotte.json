{"text":"Totally over-hyped!  Have no idea where these 5 stars come from.    I was craving lobster roll so I had the Maine lobster roll at FTF-South End.  On a positive note, the wait wasn't too crazy.  However, the lobster was a very mushy texture and flavor-less.  None of that sweet buttery flavor you expect.  Seems like it was defrosted and sitting around too long.  A lobster roll lives and dies on the strength of the lobster and this was really lacking.    My roll was room temp and no mayo.  Huh?  This definitely was not a Maine lobster roll and not worth $18.   Bottom line: bland, frozen, over-priced, over-hyped."}
{"text":"Main lobster roll- my friend loved it! She said she'd order it again! Better than the lobster at Capital Grill.  Tots- Really yummy!!  Kids grilled cheese & tots- not great grilled cheese! The tots were the best."}
{"text":"Yo! The lobster grilled cheese was the business .... my friend insisted we try this truck and I'm glad we did. I couldn't decided since all of the options looked so tasty. So we all got a few options. The grilled cheese was the popular choice but the tots were a perfect match. Yummy"}
{"text":"Cousins finally makes their debut in Charlotte and after a couple weeks of what I thought would be waiting for crowds to die down, was actually just time for the following to multiply. It was DELICIOUS. take this from a girl who LOVES her Florida lobster. Now, you may think it ridiculous to wait 90 mins in line for a palm-sized sandwich. Normally I would never wait that long for food in general. But, we were at a brewery, as is common for a Saturday afternoon in Charlotte, and had the entertainment of live music and great co vers√°tiles with friends to get us through. They operated on a limited menu, expecting floods of people. service was extremely quick. Our lobster rolls (I had a Maine and a Connecticut) were out before I even finished paying. The nest was tender, juicy and wrapped in a toasted piece of bread that was buttered to perfection.    I can't wait to try them again (hopefully one Friday for lunch) and experience the other menu items. Lobster tots looked incredible and the lobster quesadilla looked divine.   Welcome to Charlotte, Cousins! We hope you have enjoyed your welcome, and stick around for years to come!!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to track this truck down for a while and I was able to catch them on a Friday night and was first in line.  I wasn't interested in the grilled cheese or tater tots, etc., just the lobster roll please........correction the Connecticut Lobster Roll, as it is served warmed and without mayo.......yes, that one........$17 bucks! Ouch! But I get it, it's lobster and I had no problems with the price tag after devouring that roll, it was really good, really fresh, really sweet on a buttery toasted roll!    Several weeks later they were near my building during lunch and I tried them again, getting the same Connecticut roll, but this time my bread was soggy and several pieces of lobster shell was present, so I was very disappointed after dropping $17 this time around.  So, I still think the other lobster truck has my heart for now, as they are more consistent.  I am willing to try Cousin's a 3rd time but I will need some time before I forget about that soggy bread and several pieces lobster shell pieces I had to take out of my mouth."}
{"text":"I am really, really sorry to break the 5-star review streak. This place was awesome, but tonight they were a part of the Cotswold Trucks Food Truck Rally and I think they were suffering from a mild case of \"In the Weeds.\" Still, they delivered in several regards and I see this place doing outstanding here in the QC.  Yes, they were on shark tank. Uh huh, celebrities have endorsed them. Ok ok, they have a ton of different media logos all over their truck. Hype, hype, hype. I don't care what Mariah Carey thinks, I just want the food!   The rally started at 5:30 and I was there as soon as it started. Sure enough, the new kids on the block already had a line 30-deep and they were churning out food as fast as they could. To my surprise, they were really hustling as the line was moving at a steady pace. When I got to the window I ordered the Lobster Tacos with a cup of New England Clam Chowder.  Wait was about 10 minutes for my order and since this visit was more on a whim, I took my food to my car. First off, Chowder: Wonderful, Velvety, Hot, Fresh. It seemed that every bite had some clam in it, they definitely didn't skimp out on it, and it was seasoned masterfully. Wonderful job on the chowder.  My tacos looked and tasted unbelievably fresh. I think that if 10 years ago you told someone you were going to a church parking lot at night to eat seafood from a big van, they'd think you'd lost it! Nevertheless, this was very, very fresh food! You could pick out every individual note of the pico, and the cilantro-lime sauce was perfect. This is where my review could have been a slam dunk, but fell just a bit short. At first I thought the sauce just wasn't strong and the dish lack seasoning, however as I looked at my tacos, I noticed that two tacos were only partially topped in the sauce. The third taco had only one little drop of the sauce, and it really showed in the overall package. This sauce is the linchpin in the whole dish: Salty, savory, a bit of acidity, the entire dish relies on it for seasoning and every bite needs a bit of it. That final taco missing all but one little drop of sauce was somewhat of a disappointment.   I attest this oversight to the insane line they had tonight. Under more ideal conditions I'm sure this wouldn't be the case. I can tell that they're very passionate about what they're doing and you can't say they aren't putting their all in the effort. Tonight's sample of the menu has me wanting more. I'm a believer, and a follower... Just, keep me interested!"}
{"text":"We had the Connecticut's lobster roll. Very buttery and delicious chunky pieces of lobster meat! I can't wait to try them again."}
{"text":"Decent food, overpriced. Will not try again.   I am a food truck and lobster lover so I thought this would be great. I ordered the lobster grilled cheese and lobster bisque. $14.95 for the sandwich and $5 for the soup. The bread is plain and thin, reminded me of the 99 cent loaf bread, two slices of cheese and some lobster. The soup had ONE tiny piece of lobster in the cup, but it had good flavor. I am a firm believer in paying more for better food but this was not worth the money."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. We had the lobster tacos- okay, the Connecticut roll- pretty good but the size of the roll was small, and the lobster tots- which was amazing . I think overall it was good but the food was over priced. Would compare to a high end restaurant. You can always go but would you go knowing it was expensive."}
{"text":"They did not skimp on the meat... yay! But it wasn't ask flavorful as I was expecting...boo! I didn't taste the butter or lemon on my roll. Very friendly folks, line moved quickly and my roll was ready in less than 10 mins I'd say.  Next time I'll likely try one of their offerings that comes with pico and a sauce to add some flavor."}
{"text":"A treat this Memorial Day weekend, when this truck came to our community. The menu features a variety of lobster rolls, Connecticut (mayo) and Maine (buttered)  both with tater tots if desired (extra cost), lobster grilled cheese, lobster bisque and New England clam chowder  just to name a few items. I ordered a deconstructed lobster salad (  plain lobster with a side of mayo) plus the lobster bisque. My dining mate ordered the lobster roll ( on a toasted roll) Our lobster meat tasted fresh , sweet and tender. The soup was delicious. In my opinion both overpriced for the quantity. About $17.00 for the roll, $6.00 for the  small cup of soup I have no idea whether the lobster was previously frozen but the taste was  very fresh. Indeed a treat for me and my dining mate who used to vacation yearly on Cap Cod and enjoyed lobster as well as other New England seafood."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. The roll was stale, the lobster had no flavor ( you can tell that it's frozen, not fresh). They put just a small amount of mayo on the bun, not enough to even taste. The only reason they are getting 2 stars and not 1 is the amount of lobster you get. The concept is there, just not the flavor. If they were more passionate about how their product went out, this would be a hit."}
{"text":"This truck does a classic Lobster Roll RIGHT. Lightest touch of mayo, always get a claw, and a lightly toasted and buttered roll. That's all you need!  The only downfall is the wait you'll have to stand in whenever this truck rolls around. I went to Sycamore Brewings Summer Fest just to get one of these rolls and waited in a like for over 2 hours. Yes. 2. Hours. Worth it? Yes (plus hey hey, sipping a couple brews made it not so bad). But holy cow. For a relatively simple recipe it was a little insane. I've been fortunate to grow up in the North East and miss authentic lobster rolls so much. Cousins falls right in line with the best, just mind the line ;)"}
{"text":"Went out of our way to Food Truck Friday in Dilworth with my wife because CML truck was going to be there and she wanted to try it.   She wanted a lobster roll just like from Connecticut where she grew up.  The line around 730 was pretty long, but folks around seemed happy with the food.  We had a Connecticut Roll. She was happy, said it was the closest thing to authentic since moving to NC, though portion seemed smaller. Lobster was cooked perfectly and not overdone like many places. The clam chowder was also better than we have had around.   Overall we would get it again, but it's a bit expensive to make a regular thing."}
{"text":"Blue blaze brewery last Saturday. I arrived at 11:30am and sat in my car until around 11:40 when I saw others driving into parking lot across the street.  I was #2 in line when truck opened at 12. The wait for order was abt 15mins.  I ordered both lobster rolls and lobster tacos and also side order of tots. Tots delicious and plentiful for $4!! Both rolls were loaded and worth every penny!! Tacos lacked in size and lobster quantity for the price. I'll stick with the rolls and tots and maybe try the grilled cheese next time."}
{"text":"We tried the lobster quesadillas and the lobster grilled cheese. It was by far the best decision I made all week!! Seasoned to perfection!! 4 stars because they are extremely pricey for what you get.  I would say the quesadillas were definitely worth over paying, the grilled cheese was not worth anywhere near what they are charging."}
{"text":"This food truck definitely lived up to the hype. I got the Connecticut roll and the lobster was so fresh and flavorful. The line was long even though we arrived before they opened and it didn't move too fast because they cook everything fresh but it was worth the wait. I will definitely keep an eye on their schedule to see where they'll be next."}
{"text":"Came across this food truck on our way to Beer Temple. They were parked outside of PIedmont Social House. I ordered the lobster roll with tots and my son ordered the cheese quesadilla. The lobster roll was on a buttery toasty bun and it was delicious. Had a good amount of lobster on it and you can taste the acidic from the lemon that was lightly squeezed on it. Delicious! The tots were hot and tasty especially when you add the seasoning that they had for it - maybe some kind of Cajun seasoning nor seafood seasoning. My son liked his cheese quesadilla because it had a lot of cheese on it which he loves. Can't go wrong with that. It was prepared fast too."}
{"text":"Yum! I wasn't very hungry but knew I had to get something. They have a nice selection and decent prices for what they serve. I got a bowl of the clam chowder because it's my favorite soup. I got it served piping hot. It was creamy and had a lot of clams in it. I was very pleased. I'm going to try a lobster roll next time!"}
{"text":"Best lobster roll I have had in a very long time! It was worth the wait for about 30 minutes. The line at Sweet Union grew very quickly and was 25-30 deep for a solid 2 hours. The tater tots are amazing!"}
{"text":"Their brand was on Shark Tank... but it is franchised. Anyone can buy into it.  To say the lobster is fresh.... there is no way that lobster was fresh. Whoever believes it is,has never been to Maine or Massachusetts. I go to Maine annually just for lobster. It was definitely frozen but that's not even the issue. I agree with Shana's earlier review. Very disappointed with the flavor; I expected much better. I won't rush out for Cousins again but would give them a second chance. Hoping for a better experience."}
{"text":"Was at Divine Barrel Brewery and this truck pulled up.  I saw the word lobster and was immediately like - YEP!  Once they were ready to go, the line was long immediately, but they moved rather quickly.  I ordered the Connecticut Roll; the Lobster Tots; and a Whoopie Pie.  The roll and tots were amazing! I was surprised that I enjoyed the lobster tots as much as I did. They were actually really flavorful. ...he whoopie pie I can live without... For a food truck my order was kinda pricey, but all things considered I will definitely add this truck to my 'Favs' list.  :-)"}
{"text":"I'd been waiting for Wednesday all week because i'd been craving a Lobster Roll. Expecting to see my go to truck on the schedule at the Whitehall lunch rally, I was disappointed to see that they wouldn't be there. But excited to see there was another option. Walking up to the truck there was a crowd surrounding it. Checking out the menu, I loved the variation in options!! I was excited to try everything, but I narrowed it to 2 options, and just ordered both :-). I ordered the Lobster Grilled Cheese Sandwich Combo #2 (Tots & Drink), and the Connecticut Lobster Roll.   The wait wasn't long at all. I walked to the car to clear my hands so I could carry my food, by the time I returned my food was ready. Before walking away I season my food with what looked like Old Bay but could have also been a different cajun type seasoning, I couldn't tell. I also grabbed a few pieces of foil and more Ketchup. It was pretty annoying how stingy they were with the Ketchup. 2 packs for a full basket of tots? Then when asking for more, I unfortunately only got 2 more.  Now it's time to eat and I was excited. Everything was still really warm, I only work a couple minutes away. Starting with the tots, they were a little disappointing, but I already knew that from the one I tasted before wrapping them up. Lacked salt & weren't crispy at all. Thank goodness for the seasoning they had there which made them edible. The Lobster Roll was ok. It was pretty dry and lacked that punch of lobster flavor that I wanted. Needed a bit more butter and salt. The Grilled Cheese was the star for me. Plenty of lobster between 2 buttery slices of bread and melted cheese. It was yummy.   All in all it wasn't bad, but not enough for me to neglect the Lobster Dogs  Food Truck... except for the Grilled Cheese. They are also more expensive than Lobster Dogs at $16.95 vs Lobster Dogs $15. But I would give them another try being that they are still pretty new and finding their flow, especially since soon they will be a regular at my job every other Wednesday!"}
