{"text":"Great food...very affordable...the momos, especially are amazing ...they also provide free wireless.."}
{"text":"Delicious hidden gem on the Northside!  We tried the pan fried momas for an appetizer which are similar to Korean mandu (dumpling).  Must be made in house because they were *so* fresh. The Lamb Nepali entree was super flavorful and had multiple veggie sides with buttery jasmine rice.  Their mango lassi was a perfect pairing to cool off the spice -not too sweet or too yogurt tart."}
{"text":"Don't let the sketchy entrance stop you!  Really delicious food, and we made sure to try a bunch of items from different sections of the menu. The momo were a real treat with just a little spice. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were a bit confused when the door to Subba was locked on a Friday afternoon, but after a phone call, the owner ran down and let us in. It seemed like he wasn't planning on being open, but after seeing our hungry faces, he offered to cook for us.  It quickly became apparent that this is a one man operation. The owner was cook, server, and cleaner. And he couldn't have been more friendly.  We started with the dumplings. Delicious and plentiful, and the sauce had a real kick. I got the lamb platter for my main... it was filled with a colorful assortment of sides, and the spices and flavors were so diverse. Everything was tasty, and seemed quite fresh.  The decor needs some serious work, but nevertheless, it's an experience worth checking out. And the value is great... we left stuffed for only a few bucks."}
{"text":"There is some sort of magical deliciousness that Subba sprinkles over everything I've ordered there. The momo (dumplings) are delicious; the vegetable biryani is delicious; the veggie Nepali dish is delicious. Raita and lassi are also great. The menu lists \"Indian tea,\" which is code for chai--it's great. Also for some reason the prices are from like 1995. It's nuts.  Service is extremely solicitous and sweet and friendly, from some very nice guys who also seem to work in the kitchen and don't speak especially strong English. Expect to wait a few minutes for them to come out and help you, but if you wave them over they're happy to help immediately.  My parents and I went to a few fancy well-known restaurants around Pittsburgh and our best meal by a wide margin was at the divey, homey, very inexpensive, crazily delicious Subba."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh right now. The food is delicious. You feel like you're eating food cooked at someone's house and not mass produced in a restaurant.  The momos are excellent. I'm just really glad that I found a restaurant where they serve delicious momos in Pittsburgh. I've been to Subba twice and one of the times I just ordered a plate of momos as my main course (they're listed as starters).  Which brings me to the price. Everything is really cheap and the quantity is huge (not to mention delicious!). The restaurant itself is in an older building and the entrance makes it look like a hole in the wall, but don't be fooled by that! I've been recommending this place to every person I've met since and I've been there twice in a week even though it's a bit of a drive from where I live."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday and have no idea why this place would be as empty as it was. The service was good and the food was amazing! We had the chicken & broccoli and the mixed grill lo mein and recommend both dishes to others. Everyone should come and try this hidden gem in the Northside!"}
{"text":"I just had a delicious meal at subba- the Nepali chicken was so flavorful and had just the right amount of spice. My less adventuresome dining partner had general Tsos chicken and he swears it's the best he's ever had. The service was on the slower side, but very gracious and welcoming. You could tell it's a small operation and just the kind of tasty find you really want to see succeed. We even got a free special Diwali treat at the end of our meal. Were already looking forward to returning to try some more dishes!"}
{"text":"The Burgh is not known for international cuisine - but it would be if you adventured to hole in the wall family places like Subba. Definitely one of my fav spots in the city.   ***warning*** It can be spicy!!! But they have bar none the best mango lassi I ever had to cool it all down.  The momo - hand-made dumplings full of chicken (not scary processed something) that go to a whole new level with the spicy dipping sauce.  The Napali food is amazing. Some have lamented not enough meat, but Nepali food is not meat focused. It is an ensemble platter with multiple styles of vegetables, sauté rice, daal (lentil soup - more protein) and a sauced meat dish.   Decor leaves to be desired, service can be slow, but if you want to leave your 'Merica behind and indulge in spicy yumminess - get yourself to Subba."}
{"text":"When I went there was only the chef working as the server cook and host! I asked him what he recommended, as I am vegan, and I like to see what the chef would prefer to serve. I was really on the rocks about trying it but what sealed the deal was the spotless kitchen I saw on my way out. I stopped right in my tracks and went right back in to find a seat. I work in fine dining but I have never seen a kitchen that clean, his set up is cleaner than the $$$ restaurant that I work at. A clean kitchen is the sign of a passionate chef. The food is cheap and unbelievably good. I had the momo which is handmade in house and the vegetable fried rice. The momo is SO good. You can tell that the dough is made in house and they are rolled every night. The fried rice was everything I wanted it to be. Flavorful and robust without being oily or oversalted. Despite it's low prices, I fear that it will become a money trap for me because I live so close by that I will probably frequent it every night. Don't let the strange building throw you off, this is some of the best food Asian food in Pittsburgh at an unbelievably low price"}
{"text":"Lunch was delicious and affordable. Don't let the entrance put you off. Staff was friendly, service was quick, and the restaurant was clean. Try it!!"}
{"text":"Food was surprisingly good. Server guys were not trained at all, but they were so nice, fast, and looked like they are taking their job seriously. Also I loved that it is byob. The only bad thing is- I felt some funky smell inside the restaurant.. So I would pay more attention towards cleaning the bathroom.. Will come back for sure!! Hope ur business will grow!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken sadoko omg it was really good perfectly seasoned and spicy just how I like it! The only thing was the chicken was very dry I think they fry it and it seemed over cooked. Would have been much better with some fresh grilled chicken!"}
{"text":"cleanliness: ** decor/ambiance:** service: *** food:*** value for price: ****  This is one of those places you could only find on Yelp, especially if you're from out of town. The front is very minimally marked and shows a questionable degree of promise due to the filthy awning on the front. The front door is also covered by greasy smudges/handprints on the interior side. It is propped open with a dirty, broken broomstick. C'mon guys, get a bucket of bleach and show some sense of pride in your place of business.  We were a party of six and had some hesitation based on our initial impression, but soldiered on up to the second floor to see if what the other reviewers an experienced was as good as the write ups. As the six of us made our way across the very sticky floor, we kept the faith and we seated at our table by a friendly waiter. The menu is fairly simple and easy to read. our orders were taken quickly and easily. the food was very good, highlights were the chicken dumplings, naan and vegtable curry. An absolute standout was the porridge dessert. Do not miss this. All at our table enjoyed it immensely. The hot indian tea was also especially good.  Value for price can't  be beat, portions are generous. I have little patience for lack of cleanliness though, and this place rates very low. If you don't offer hand napkins in the bathroom, then you need the powerful hand dryers. What they had mounted on the wall was less powerful than a travel sized blow dryer."}
{"text":"I've dined in and ordered out and have been impressed each time. Fried momos and the Nepali plates (I like lamb) are first-rate; my goal is to eat my way through the menu. Pittsburgh is woefully lacking in good Asian food, so we're incredibly lucky to have Subba here on the North Side. Also, yes, the food is flavorful and sort of spicy to those who aren't used to spice, so be sure to ask before you order. (There's something for everyone here if you just ask.) And don't forget to BYO if you dine in--state store is just up the street. Let's keep this place in business forever!"}
{"text":"Upon hearing that there was a Nepali restaurant in the Northside I wanted to obviously give it a try. I however have not tried it. The photo of the menu on urban spoon apparently is wrong... this caused some confusion and as I tried to order the person on the phone became short with me and tried forcing me into a dish I did not want. I see the reviews and am sure the food is great but will never attempt to return due to the extremely poor attitude."}
{"text":"i live nearby so my boyfriend & i get take-out here all of the time.  the food is AWESOME !!  the banana lassi is homemade with real banana (no fake stuff).  the nepalese dishes are AWESOME.  i also love the chewy steamed dumplings (momo).  i asked the owner/chef to make me a vegetarian version of the sadako & he made it with sauteed potatoes & it was AWESOME !  it's full of good stuff (sauteed cabbage, cilantro, carrot, tomato, chives, onions, lemon wedges, & the TASTIEST spices!)  for those that don't like a lot of onions (because these are only slightly sauteed so they're still strong), then you may want to request less the onion in the sadako.  we eat indian & thai all of the time & this nepali food is just as good at a much more reasonable price.  those are take-out chinese food prices !!!!  but this stuff is AUTHENTIC & TASTY !!!  for those that complain about the slow service, i've talked to the owner.  he's from nepal & his English isn't perfect but he's learning.  he often is working by himself so sometimes you won't get your water filled as quickly as in another place - but this place just opened up & he's still trying to put a staff together.  b/c of that, my boyfriend & just get take-out ...a lot...several times a week. someone complained on this site that there weren't enough candies in the fennel seed near the cash register - well, i mentioned that to him & a few days later when i returned he had corrected that.  the owner is very nice & polite & quiet (no \"bravado\" or arrogance at all) but he just doesn't understand a lot of English so the person who complained on this site that they didn't have a good conversation w/ him over the phone when they were ordering take-out b/c he didn't know what dish they wanted, i'm sure it was b/c the owner (who answers the phone) didn't understand their English.  it would be a sin if this place failed b4 he got a chance to get off the ground.  no, the water isn't filled every ten minutes, but the food is AWESOME & very \"home made\" tasting - everything tastes natural (no \"thickening\" fake stuff that all chinese restaurants use & sometimes even thai places are starting to use in their dishes)."}
{"text":"Bottom line - we will be back!   We followed the advice from other reviews and ordered off the Nepali side of the menu. Excellent advice.  We had the vegetable momos - that's what everyone said to get for the appetizer. Good advice. One appetizer is plenty for two people.  We had the Chicken Nepali and Pork Nepali main dishes. These are wonderful. Served on platters with various sides and sauces - along with a wonderful serving of rice to eat with. This is definitely spicy food, but my order was not overly salty, which I read previously.  We also took one reviewer's advice and ordered a side of aloo paratha, again another great suggestion. One serving is plenty for two people.  Dinner was great. More than enough food. Very reasonable prices. The waiter was very nice and helpful.   If you're not familiar with the location, it's in the North Side at the corner of East Ohio and Cedar, right around the corner from the Subway restaurant. As other reviewers note, the entrance door may not look like the right spot - but it's the door with the Subba sign above. And you will walk up the stairs to the restaurant. It's all fine.  As I said, we will be back."}
{"text":"Food is really good, and the price is more than fair for what you get. BYOB. The building it's located in isn't much to look at but don't let that fool you when it comes to the quality of the food. Staff is super friendly but not always in a hurry. Which I am more than fine with during a long dinner over a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Some neighborhood word of mouth was good.  Prices seem reasonable.  Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience.  We tried to put in a reservation ahead of time for a party of seven, but there was confusion over the phone.  When we arrived, it was not busy.  Our food came out at different times - first person served was done eating before the last person got their food.  All meat in the dishes was overcooked, and possibly even re-heated.  Curried vegetables on the side had been frozen - the flavor was good, but the veg had obviously been microwaved as there were icy cold spots, and, it's impossible to miss the texture of potatoes that have been frozen.  Some of the sauces were pretty good (Nepali), others bland (Mongolian chicken, biryani, lo mein).  The momos and their curried dipping sauce were very good.  We'd like to see any restaurant succeed in our neighborhood.  We may try this place again in the future after they've had time to work out the kinks and find a way to provide consistent fresh food."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable!  We got two lassis, momos (dumplings), potato naan, and two platters of Nepali food for only $30.  We were also the only people in the place on a Friday night! Maybe people can't find the entrance? Subba is on the second story on the corner of E Ohio and Cedar and the door is on Cedar with a red awning.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was flavorful, well cooked, and authentic.  I really enjoyed my meal and I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Phg."}
{"text":"I'm a weekly patron and it's worth a visit every time you stop by the north side. The spicy fired rice will make you sweat."}
{"text":"One and only Nepali restaurant I've been to but definitely the best. The Nepali dishes are all delicious and very reasonably priced. Downside is the decor and location but the upside is BYOB, supporting a truly local business that makes the northside better, and easy takeout."}
{"text":"The food is great! The ambiance is so so. I think this place is just waiting to be discovered and then you'll never get it on a fri or sat night. Now, you never have to even wait. Just walk and and be seated. Staff is very attentive. Menu has tons of offerings, just not very informative. You sort of have to roll the dice and pick something, but thats fine, everything is good."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!!!  Just got take out for the first time and I am blown away. I make my own potstickers and I'm sad to say their Momo's are better than mine. Best thing I had was the Sadako Chicken which had deep flavor and the perfect creeper burn but I would try anything they were cooking up! The atmosphere is awkward but bring a bunch of friends and make it your own....or just get take out!."}
{"text":"I have nothing negative to say about this place! It's really cute once you walk up the stairs. The food is very reasonably priced for the amount and quality you get. It's clean and the staff is nothing but nice and welcoming. When we go we usually order from the napalese or Chinese portions of the menu and have yet to be disappointed. I have had their napalese lamb multipal times and it's amazing, you get so many things to sample in one meal. The food is very colorful and has a verity of spices and fresh ingredients. The only sad thing I can say about this place is that every time my partner and I have come, we have been the only customers there. I wish the place was more widely known about."}
{"text":"Based on solid reviews and an interest in exotic cuisine, I had to try this restaurant.  The location is on the North side.  It's definitely a rougher part of town.  The exterior is unassuming.  You enter on the ground level and walk up a flight to the restaurant.  You are greeted by the chef and maitre de.  He is one and the same.  Decor is sparse but clean.  The music and incense speak to a traditional restaurant.  We only tried the Nepalese and IndoPak food.  Momos are the pork dumpings - they were very good.  We enjoyed a roast pork appetizer as well.  The chicken biryani had little flavor but at least the chicken was tender.  The Nepalese lamb curry was tasty as were the sides that came with it.  The beef stew was tasty but the beef was a bit tough.  The Naan was a potato version that was so-so.  The rice was greasy including the biryani and this was the disappointing part of the meal.  The most attractive part of the meal was the quick service and the price - dinner for three was $44 without a tip.  So in short, cheap but greasy.  I like places that try hard so I will be back."}
{"text":"I would love to have known the food at this place before reviewing. I love Asian-Fusion restaurants and was so ready to try Nepali food. Upon arrival here, my boyfriend and I were \"greeted\" and sat at a table. We ordered our drinks and the Momo dumplings based on the gleaming Yelp reviews. We waited for 20 minutes (no refill on our drinks) before the miserable server came back (I mean hostess aka waitress aka wtf) to tell us they were all out of the appetizer. What? It was certainly out when I ordered it. Anyway, no apology from her. I asked how the other appetizer was and she said \"yeah it's good\" so I ordered it instead. She almost walked away before I asked \"can we order our meals as well?\" With a nod, we both ordered the Nepali lamb. After another half-hour, she didn't come back. No refills, no apologies for the delay, literally the only table sitting there with no food. Give me a break! I was a server. I get it. It's not easy, but just a simple \"sorry for the delay, here's another drink\" would've alleviated my scorn at that point. Hire more help! The food we ordered likely wasn't made yet, but if it was, now it's going in the garbage. I will never recommend this place. Get a grip. Good service and average food=success. Zero service and invisible food with a waitress playing hide and go seek=failure. See you in my nightmares, Subba! I'll never get to try your delicious cuisine."}
{"text":"Before giving Subba a try I have never had Nepali food before.  If you are a fan of Indian and Asian flavors - chances are you would really enjoy this place.  I decided to eat here after hearing reading several decent reviews on the Allegheny City Central Facebook page..  The food here, in my opinion, was excellent.  I shared the pan-seared Momos as an appetizer, I had the Nepali Chicken, and my boyfriend had the General Tso's chicken (he wasn't feeling as adventurous).  Everything was well-seasoned, well prepared, and delicious.  The service we had was great, very friendly and informative about the food.    I will say that Subba did not have the best ambiance and it did take awhile to get our food - even though there were not many people inside.  I know this is a new place and hopefully they are still working out some of the kinks.  I think if this place could re-decorate a bit, maybe paint, lower the lights, have some candles, and promote itself as a BYOB - I think this could be a real hidden gem.  If you feel like trying something new I recommend giving Subba a try."}
{"text":"Yuuuum!  Despite its' less than ideal location and lack of appealing décor...the food is delicious.  I wanted to try something different for lunch today so I got the Veggie momo and the veggie curry.  So good.  Don't let the look of the place dissuade you from trying the delicious food."}
{"text":"I had never had Nepali food before, but everything we tried was delicious and extremely reasonably priced.  The flavors bordered on Indian and other Asian cuisines, but had something unique about them as well, especially the curry gravy that my main chicken dish came in.  The momo (dumplings) were clearly homemade and really wonderful.  The pan-fried chicken dumplings were probably my favorite, but the veggie dumplings were also delicious, with hints of curry, cinnamon, and a spicy sauce.  Looking forward to returning!  The dining area is nothing exciting, but we were there for the food, not the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this Nepalese curry joint. Excellent Chicken curry dinner with all the fixings and sweet tea to drink. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Too Spicy!  Ordered the chicken fried rice where no indication on the menu would lead me to believe it was spice.  This dish is not spicy at other asian restaurants.   It was OK except for the excessive amount of spice and oh I had a hard time finding the tiny pieces of chicken.  Also ordered the Nepali chicken and chicken curry with rice both dishes appeared alike and tasted alike with the same sauces.  I know this place gets a lot of positive reviews but it just didn't appeal to me."}
{"text":"Yelp for the win!! Looking for something good and a little different and this was a major score!! Place is simple and truly all about the food! So happy I found this hidden gem! Will be back for sure can't wait to explore this whole menu"}
{"text":"The restaurant is on the 2nd floor up a flight of stairs from the street. If you don't know what to order, let's me just say that this place serves up some great momos (Nepali dumplings). We've had momos in Nepal and on the west coast and the chicken momos here are excellent with the spicy dip!"}
{"text":"Food was terrific. Split the steamed and fried momo with a friend - these dumplings are a must-have. Also had the pork Nepalese dish. It was the perfect level of spicy. Very savory. The restaurant looks a little sketchy but the service was polite and pretty fast (although there weren't many customers).  I would recommend it for the awesome food alone.  BYOB."}
{"text":"I'm giving Subba 5 stars and ignoring appearances. This is not a spot for a date, but the food is simply amazing. If you don't mind eating situations or are doing take out, this is a must try."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in Pittsburg. Tried the veg momos and chicken lo-mein was delicious. Would definitely come back to this place. A must try if you like Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place continues to amaze me.  Momo are some of the best things on the planet.  Nepalese dishes are tasty with tons of different flavors on the platter.  No frills. All taste!"}
{"text":"very nice Nepali food.. must try MOMO. usually people get confused with Nepali and Chinese food. though they are having similar dishes, it won't taste like Chinese food since it has some indian influence. i would highly recommend this place as Nepali food and not to compare with Indian or Chinese food. this is the most authentic Nepali food..owner is very humble, doesn't care much about money. I've seen him many times charging me less than what he supposed to  (may be because i eat there often)."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: Serves Chinese, Indian and Nepalese dishes, but get the Nepalese dishes. The entrance looks a bit sketchy and you have to go upstairs to get to the restaurant. Affordable, quality, good tasting food.  So it's a bit scary looking at the front door and even the steps going upstairs might make you want to turn around and go somewhere else. Don't. Especially if you're an adventurous eater like myself. I've never had Nepalese food before and I'm so glad there is a place that serves it right in my back yard. The Nepalese menu isn't that large, but it's enough to get a taste. Based on other reviews, we got the steamed veggie momos which were eight little dumplings. They're similar to other Asian dumplings, but the sauce makes them different. The sauce is quite special and I have no idea what it is, but it is spicy, citrusy and perhaps a little curry-like. As our entree, we got the Pork Nepali, which was delicious. It comes with a variety of little sides like curried vegetables and pickled vegetables. The rice - there is something special. Maybe they cook it in butter and garlic or something, but it was so delicious on its own. My only gripe is that perhaps the Pork Nepali was a bit too salty, including the sides. However, when eating with rice or naan, it balances it out a bit better. The service was incredibly fast and the prices were affordable."}
{"text":"Outstanding food in a very clean but unpretentious setting. We had a large family gathering nearby, so ordered a whole lot of everything...chicken, lamb, seafood, and veggie dishes. All were prepared deliciously! Packed to go better than any restaurant I've ever been to.  Give this place a try, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I live in the area so I was trying to find some good local spots. Its right off of East Ohio Street in Northside which can get a little bit sketchy at times.  I wouldnt recommend strolling down East Ohio lol... But dont let the location discourage you!   The entrance is on Cedar Ave though across from the park.  This restaurant has GREAT food. Its a nice blend of asian food and indian, its actually Nepalese food - which is very delicious. Im a little bit obsessed with this place.  If you really like Indian/Asian and or have tried Nepalese food, you should give this place a try. The ambience/ atmosphere is a little basic but the food makes up for it. And its super affordable. **Try the Sadako Chicken, my taste buds turned around and slapped me in the face it was so damn good."}
{"text":"I love subba.  Please support this north side business owner.  I love the Napali dish.  It's a great sampler.  I've never tried Napili dishes before here.  The momos are a must try too!"}
{"text":"First off, this little restaurant in the North Side looks super sketchy from the outside. The exterior of this place really needs a major face-lift to make it more appealing. After entering the front door, you have to hike up this narrow stairway to another door. Once entering the second door, then you reach the restaurant.   The restaurant itself is quite spacious with plenty of seats for large groups. The decorations are all over the place though. I became quite confused with the Bollywood music playing in the background and Chinese zodiac placemats under my silverware. Are they going for a fusion feel? Service was a bit lacking since there was only one guy there.   I am a huge fan of Nepali food and was super excited when I found out there is a Nepali restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had the chance to try three items on the menu: pan fry momo, sadako chicken and the Nepali pork dinner plate. The momos were crisp and oily. They're just fried dumplings, nothing special. The sadako chicken was the worst though. After looking over the pictures posted by other yelpers, I felt cheated! The sadako chicken that I got was pretty much a salad of chicken pieces, carrots, cabbage, white onions, white onions, white onions, white onions and more white onions. This is raw white onions I'm talking about--like 50% white onions. Such typical plate fillers, they could've been a little more creative.   For entrée, I had the Nepali pork plate. The plate came with white rice and pork in curry sauce with a side of some brown sauce, mung bean soup, stir fried bok choy, deep fried vegetables and pickled vegetables. I thought there were too many unnecessary side dishes. I spent the majority of my dinning experience figuring out what I'm eating. I rather they have one solid, well-made Nepali dish so I can direct my attention on that. The pork in curry sauce was well cooked with a crispy edge. I liked that they fried the pork before throwing it into the curry sauce to prevent it from getting too mushy. Thumbs up for the pork texture! The curry was super spicy though so be careful if you have sensitive taste buds. Out of all the tiny side dishes, my favorite was the fried vegetables with chunks of sweet potatoes.   Overall the food here was just ok. The items are definitely hit or miss. I don't like how inconsistent the quality of their food is. Subba has potential, but it needs to step it up a notch. I recommend going here for the experience, but not a place I will go out of my way to check out again."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place! The chicken curry was the best I'd ever had. The Nepali pork platter was AMAZING!! The kheer was delicious and made fresh when we ordered it. I have no complaints whatsoever about the food or the service. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! The building is a little rough from the outside but great overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great authentic food! Come here about once every 6 weeks and always enjoy my meal! Would recommend if you like trying something authentic and unique"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant, well worth the trip to the north side. We got steamed veg momo, very flavorful and spicy - which we like. The lamb and chicken Nepali dishes were both fantastic, although the lamb was the hands down favorite. Each came with 5-6 little side dishes that were all tasty additions - some chopped savory Nepali greens, pickled carrots, lentil soup, etc. Finished up with \"Indian flavored tea\" (aka chai) that was so creamy and rich.  The owner is just getting started and clearly knows Nepali cooking. I plan to come here often and everyone else should too."}
{"text":"Nice welcoming Nepali brother. We ordered veg and chicken momos, along with some tea and Nepali vegetables. The momos were excellent. The sauce they gave along with it was okay. Good portions."}
{"text":"Randomly found this place because the place we were planning to eat had no parking. Boy are we happy that we found. A little bit of everything for everyone. We ate the Nepali food and some of the Subba specials and they were absolutely delicious. They sell lo mein and Chinese dinners Chinese soup Nepali food curry Indian curry and Biryani and Subba specials which I think are from Bhutan. They also have delicious mango banana and mixed lassies. Open seven days a week 11 8 to 10 P. They are in Cedar Avenue on the second floor behind the subway with the blinking light in the window. Oh also the food was very spicy. Looking forward to coming back with friends. The owner was really nice too."}
{"text":"The place seems a little frightening at first because you enter a side door, go up two flights of steps and walk past the kitchen to get to the dining area. The decor is strange but my toddler loved it, which made me love it. The food smells incredible and if you are a fan of spicy, you'll love it. The toddler had veggie momos, which of course I had maybe 2, 3 okay 4 of them, and we both loved the flavor. For my meal I had the veg nepali plate. I ate everything. Everything."}
{"text":"The food is good. Really good.  My boyfriend and I were starving and over ordered...which wasn't a bad thing b/c we got to try different things. We had: Chicken Sadako - Amazing. One of the best chicken dishes I have had in Pittsburgh. It consisted of well-seasoned semi-fried chicken with raw onions, garlic, cilantro and tomatoes cooked w/ lemon. Vegetable Momos - Again, amazing. Doughy skin stuffed w/ vegetable filling. The sauce that comes w/ it is unique and really tasty. I don't know what the sauce is made of, but it was a little bit sour and tangy. Pan-Fried Chicken Momos - Good but I preferred the vegetable ones. It comes w/ the same sauce. Nepali Chicken - This dinner set came w/ a bowl of chicken curry (dark meat chicken which was tender!), an extra small bowl of the curry sauce, fried potatoes and vegetables, pickled cabbage, ?pickled greens and a side of the same sauce that came w/ the momos. It also came w/ a plate of rice. Some people rave about the rice but I did not like it at all....it was too hard, and it tasted cooked but w/ an un-cooked texture. Kung Pao Chicken - I don't typically like kun pao chicken but my boyfriend ordered it and it looked good so I gave it a try. I liked that it wasn't overly breaded. Not my favorite but the boyfriend enjoyed it quite a bit.  Service is almost nonexistent but I let it slide b/c it was a family establishment and it sounded like they were busy in the kitchen.  I don't usually venture over to this part of Pittsburgh for food since it is a bit far from where I live, but I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"My best friend and I found this place about a year ago and are so happy we did! We find it hard to get take out from anywhere else because we feel nowhere else compares. If you are looking for what is good on the menu I would recommend...   1. The General Tsos Chicken: it's not overly sweet like a lot of take out seems to be.  2. The pork momos: the dipping sauce they come with is a perfect combination of tang and spice (you won't go wrong if you get the veggie momos instead)- fried or steamed 3. Chicken Lo Mein: perfect amount of sauce, its not drenched   There's nothing fancy about the inside but don't let that steer you away- the staff is always friendly and quick. It's close to PNC Park if you wanted to go somewhere a little less mainstream before a game!"}
{"text":"Subba is located at the corner of East Ohio and Cedar on Pittsburgh's lovely northside on the second floor of a very unassuming building.  When we arrived, the owner (I think) was in the kitchen helping the chef.  I know this because a friendly family that dines there all the time, and the restaurant's only guests last night, told me so.  We took a seat and he came out shortly thereafter to greet us with a mile-wide grin.    I ordered the Lamb Nepali and my mumsie ordered the Chicken Nepali.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but what arrived was a series of small silver bowls with a variety of ingredients surrounding a bed of jasmine (I think) rice.  I threw everything onto the rice and hoped for the best.  I was not disappointed.  Nepali not your thing?  Subba also offers a Chinese menu so you can chow on General Tso's 'til your heart's content (and it did look delicious).  At $25 total for the two of us, it was a cheap date and the food was wonderful.  On the spicy side, so be forewarned, but a lovely departure from the casino buffet which we were tempted to drown ourselves in after losing our collective shirts at Rivers earlier that day.    Give Subba a try. The owner is so sweet and the food so delicious - truly a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Authentic!  I spent three weeks in Nepal, and this place brings back good memories.  Delicious momos. Daal. Etc. The service is lovely - fresh off the boat."}
{"text":"I used to go here often when I was was student in the ccac. Everything is great but I don't like how all the curry and momo and chowmein kinda taste the same. The momo (vegetables ) don't have vegetables it's kinda taste like minced potatoes I'd say. I've lived in Nepal for 19 years so I've tasted way better momos maybe that's why as well. The Tibetan momos are the best. The chowmein is kind of too oily for me as well. But cravings man I go there just to satisfy my cravings for momo. Sometimes they served us burnt ( like not edible burned) chowmein which was bit annoying."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely one to add to the rotation of favorites!  We started with the steamed vegetarian momos; they were delicious, plentiful (eight!), and served with a dipping sauce unlike any other I'd ever tried.  So good.  We also got an order of vegetable pakora, and those were really different from the sort you get at Indian restaurants--softer and almost creamy inside with lots of subtle flavors.  Yum!  After this mountain of food (we did not expect appetizers to be meal-sized, especially at such low prices) came our entree platters.  We ordered from the Nepali menu and got these wonderful trays of small dishes, each more delicious than the next.  I don't usually care about daal, but Subba's is amazing.  The chicken, the vegetables, the pickle-- everything on my tray was a treat.  The flavors were varied but complemented each other really well.  I stopped feeling hungry about five bites in, but the deliciousness kept tempting me back for more.  So worth the indulgence!  And all of this at really, really low prices.  I almost laughed when we got the check; so much cheaper than you'd expect for the quality and portion sizes.    They make their mango lassi with coconut; you need to try this.  The staff was so nice!  The place is clean and cute.  The kitchen, which you can see on your right as you enter was spotless.  Subba's Nepali menu isn't comparable to anything else in Pittsburgh right now.  This place is a gem.  Just go!"}
{"text":"Subba is not very fancy, but it does prepare wonderful Nepalese cuisine. Everything is authentic and delicious. It's hard to believe how inexpensive the prices are. We ordered all vegetarian. The potions were all plentiful, and everything was cooked perfectly.  We tried to order the vegetable Momo, however they were all out. No worries, the vegetable pakora was excellent. We brought wine, but we're delighted there was no corkage fee. The website says they have s private room for parties. Subba definitely the place to go for authentic Nepalese food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"A co-worker has been wanting to try out this place for awhile and we were finally able to today. We got the vegetable Momo, pan fry momo, 3 Nepali dishes (Lamb, Pork, and Chicken), and vegetable biryani to go. Everything was truly delicious, I highly recommend the pan fried momo, I would have been happy to just have those alone. Plenty of food for the prices. I would highly recommend this place for their food, we will definitely be ordering for lunch from here again."}
{"text":"Best Nepali food in Pittsburgh! Very reasonably priced - a plate of momos for under $5! Get the Kothe momos, they are awesome!"}
{"text":"We went here during the week for dinner.   It was a ghost house.  Since we don't scare easily, we stayed and had a delightful meal.  Everything we tried was delicious and we will come back.  I am thinking this place is busier during lunch."}
{"text":"Like others said not much of an entrance up the steep steps. Nice and cool on a hot day. Room is nice in a simplistic manner. Food is really good. Service is good. Prices are good and it's BYOB. Nice house hot sauce that has a nice kick. Good variety of foods. We will be back."}
{"text":"Please go this restaurant! We were blown away by the quality and taste of the food. Been wanting to go here for so long, but the location isn't very inviting. However, ignore that fact and just go here! The food is legitimate! We especially like that they have a small menu, which is probably an advantage as they are able to maintain their quality.  We started off the the pan fried momos and chicken sadako. Both were amazing!!! The chicken sadako was especially well seasoned, with a very spicy sauce which was to die for. The momos were nicely pan fried without being oily. The sauce complements them really well!  For mains, we had the chicken and pork Nepali sets. Both amazing!! Presented beautifully, with all the curries and vegetable varieties complementing each other very nicely! We also ordered aloo paratha to go with our mains, which was perfect! Just like what you get in India!   We were extremely pleased with the food here. Service is fuss free, which is not a problem for us as we don't like to be bothered during meals. Really happy and highly recommended. Closest thing we have gotten to India/Nepal in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Hard to find. A second floor restaurant with entrance on side of building. However, good food with spicy flavor. Worth the search."}
{"text":"First time enjoying this type of food, but definitely worth the trip to the North Side on a snowy night! I was not entirely prepared for the spice level, but the flavor was wonderful and the portions were great. I got the Fish Nepali dish and my boyfriend got the Chicken Biriyani. Both   delicious, even if we had to mix in a bit more rice to offset the heat haha! The building seems a bit older, so the lighting was kind of dim and made things harder to see, but the great food outweighed any quips about the atmosphere. Very nice service as well! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is the only Nepalese restaurant I've experienced in the 'Burgh, though I've been to a few elsewhere, and we tried this place with some friends from a major east coast city. Our first impression was that the menu was a little bit odd - they offer \"American chinese food,\" some Indian food, and a Nepalese menu. We were also a little surprised by the location - nearly walking right past the place. When we did get up to the restaurant, we noted that there were only two other occupied tables, and we were meant to seat ourselves.  We ordered mango lassis and \"indian tea\" to start, which were all delicious (and so reasonable - all were under $2). We all ordered off of the Nepalese and Indian menu, and everything we got was nicely spiced (including for our one friend, who hates spicy food, who requested an \"extra mild\" meal). The vegetarian momos were SO tasty, and compared very favorably with the best momos I've experienced in the past. Their dipping sauce is mildly spicy, but excellent! Even my spice-hating friend liked it.  I ordered the Nepalese vegetarian meal, which came with lots of rice, all kinds of pickles, greens, and vegetables. My only complaint was that I wish I had gotten more greens. Others ordered the Nepalese chicken dish. One member of our group was a bit upset to find out that the chicken was breaded (not listed on the menu, and he has celiac disease). However, this person had enough other food that it was not a big deal. One other gripe was that they were out of all parathas/naan, which I was really looking forward to.   The chicken curry and the Nepalese chicken were similarly spiced, and were delicious over rice. We had easily enough food for leftovers, and the price was incredibly low. Everyone was happy and very full after we ate. Paying, as others have mentioned, was a bit confusing, as it seems we were supposed to flag down our waiter to get the check, and then bring it back to him in the kitchen to pay. Not the best service, but the food, portions and price make up for it.  I'm looking forward to going back, and I'm excited to try many more Nepalese menu items."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  Cozy, friendly, delicious, and has fast service.  Reasonably priced for their large portions. Great for eat in or take out."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, please do yourself a favor and order the Sadako Chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauteed veggies had a nice amount of crunch that provided a lovely contrast.  It's definitely on the spicy end of the spectrum, but the heat was offset nicely by fresh cilantro, sliced tomatoes, and lemon wedges. Light, flavorful, and fresh. One of the best dishes I've had in quite some time.   Also enjoyed the vegetable momos. Pillowy pockets of dough stuffed with a potato filling that reminded me of an Indian samosa that was steamed instead of fried.  Very tasty.  Entree wise, we went with an order of Nepali Chicken and Nepali Lamb.  Both were excellent. The lamb was a bit too well done for my tastes but still had a great flavor. Both dishes were presented in a way that lent itself to a choose-your-own adventure dining experience. You get a plate of rice and several little side dishes that contain a variety of delicious vegetables, lentils, chutneys, sauces, and pickled goodies. So you're only limited by the depths of your own imagination.   Subba is quite unassuming when you walk by, but please don't let that scare you away. Once you walk up the steps, you'll be greeted by a wall of amazing smells and friendly people.  Restaurant was clean, prices were fair, and the food was truly top notch.  Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I've seen positive reviews for Subba come across my yelp feed so I decided to give it a try since I was working on the North side today. Per everyone's suggestion, I went with the momo dumplings. I got the veggie and it was good with the right level of spiciness.  I wasn't super hungry, so instead of the Nepali plates which comes with more food, I went for the Indian chicken curry. I thought it was fine, but felt like I've had curry with more depth and richness.  The price is super reasonable and will definitely be back to try a Nepali entrée."}
{"text":"My roommate told me I had to try Nepal food, and apparently this is the place to do it.  Holy crap is this place a great value.  If Nepali food isn't your cup of tea, they have chinese and indian food as well (I haven't had a chance to try those yet).  As other people have said the momo dumplings are worth trying (you get around 10-12 for $5) and you could probably make your meal out of just that.  The mango lassi might be the best lassi I've ever had.   The decor could use a little updating, but you're here for the food. Service was good and the food came out very quickly.  The place is also BYOB.  Subba is a hidden gem and worth checking out."}
{"text":"I was really craving some hot and sour soup and this place had the highest rating out of the other options on Uber Eats. I had no idea this was on the North Side. Yesterday I ordered hot and sour soup and shrimp lo mein (some of the best lo mein I've had) and today I went with the soup again but beef fried rice which was very solid as well."}
{"text":"This is as authentic as it can get for a Nepali Cuisine at least in Pittsburgh. As a fellow Nepali and an avid cook myself - I'm pretty confident about my taste bud when it comes to food. Although, this place serves Indian, Chinese and Japanese - I highly recommend anyone who visits this place to go with the Nepali Menu.  Although some of the items might share some resemblance with Chinese or the Indian Dish - this is far from the truth. The Nepali dish has a certain uniqueness when it comes to flavor.  My highly recommended items on the Nepali Menu would be the Momo(s) either the pan fried or the steamed. They're both home made including the wrapper and the sauce that comes with the Momo is very spicy. So, you might want to request the chef to decrease the amount of spice.  The Thali (Rice, Variety of vegetables, Lentils and meat curry of your choice) was very good. However, the amount of curry spice used were a little more than what I wanted.  Last but not the least - the price is super reasonable. I'm sure they will raise the price as it's popularity grows but at least for now try all you can."}
{"text":"A friend implored me to add Asia Subba to yelp. And here is my gleeful compliance. Asia Subba opened up about a month ago, and I was waiting for the right moment to go, namely someone else offering to buy me dinner. The restaurant offers sushi, Indian and Nepalese food. We came specifically for the Nepalese food as I had never tried it before. We tried the pork , lamb, samusas and chicken fried rice. The lamb was amazing, very juicy and flavorful . All the entrees came with curried vegetables and steamed rice. There were also Nepalese pickled veggies that my friend referred to as a \"warm condiment\". The samusas were less spiced than the Indian version that I am Accustomed to and my son ate his fried rice. The restaurant is clean and air conditioned! Also Mr.Subba, the owner is super friendly. Please note that the restaurant is located up stairs."}
{"text":"I was so incredibly impressed with this place! I can't wait to go back and try more.  It's a little nondescript on the outside and I might have had trouble finding it if I wasn't with a friend who had been there before. It's not the fanciest place in the world and it's on the second level of the building, so you have to walk up a large flight of stairs that does NOT feel like its leading to a restaurant. The layout and decor might be difficult or intimidating for some people, but I promise it's worth it! Get up those stairs.  The menu seemed to be a mix of American-Chinese, Nepalese and Indian food. We started with the chicken momos, which were dumplings served with a very spicy dipping sauce. My friend and I both ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein while our other friend ordered a spicy curry pork dish. I can say hands down it was the best Lo Mein I've ever had in my life. The portions are huge and I'm embarrassed to admit that I still ate the whole thing. I couldn't help myself. Everyone loved their meals and we all cleaned our (very large) plates.  We chatted with the owner, asking for menu recommendations and he was very friendly! I'll definitely be going back here soon!"}
{"text":"A Thursday night adventure at a fairly quiet Subba for our first taste of Nepalese cuisine involved the #4 MOMOS (chicken-filled) and #41 LAMB THALI, with a HOT N SOUR SOUP and MASALA CHAI.    The food was a delicious blend of East and South Asian flavors, with the meaty momos and their tangy curry dipping sauce being a favorite.  The momos were nicely filled and the wrappers not too thick, though the consistency seemed factory-, not handmade.  The dish could be improved if the accompanying sauce weren't served chilled, as it put a slight damper on the warm momos, but that could be personal preference.  The \"Nepalese food\" platters are a great choice for first-time diners looking to try a bit of everything.  I wasn't a big fan of the pickles or the dal, but everything else had great flavor.  The stir-fried veggies in particular were great--a mix of zucchini, carrots, cauliflower, potatoes, etc. covered in a delicious curry.  The saag curiously tasted like lettuce instead of spinach but was delicious nonetheless.  I suppose my biggest takeaway of the evening was that you can cover pretty much anything in curry and I'll like it.  The main lamb dish was a bit disappointing--the bowl was much more sauce than meat, and the chunks of lamb themselves were way chewy and overcooked.  They were also just noticeably low quality cuts of meat, with lots of grisselly bits.  Normally, I wouldn't be so picky, but for the amount that we received (only 5ish small pieces in the bowl), I would at least expected chunks of tender meat at least.  If I'm being honest though, the part of my meal I enjoyed the most was the chai--the small but wonderfully spiced and lightly sweet cup of milky, creamy goodness was the perfect kick-off to my dinner.  I tried to sip it slowly but its deliciousness did not leave self control as an option.  The hot and sour soup I ordered as a comforting side was great as well, with your typical thick, cornstarchy restaurant consistency and packed full of veggies and swirls of egg.  It was super salty, perhaps too much so for most, but I'm a salt fiend and didn't mind one bit.  Don't a grand ambiance at Subba--it's your typical, bare-boned Asian eatery, and our one server took care of the entire, sparsely populated, dining room, but the food does come out quickly and satisfies a curry craving.  Not sure it's a repeat for me, but worth a try for something off the beaten path in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Subba since moving to the North Side several years ago. I especially enjoy bringing new friends who rave over how delicious it is.  But there is a MAJOR PROBLEM with a leak in the roof that is threatening this delicious restaurant and a SLUMLORD who has no intention of fixing it. To add to that, the owner of the Subway below Subba has no interest in helping Subba's owner make a case for fixing the roof - but it's likely only a matter of time before the water becomes a problem below as well.   Is there anything we can do to help this beloved restaurant?"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. Soooo cheap for such delicious food. From the Nepali appetizers to the entree. Momos are delicious. Entrees are all delicious. Will come back repeatedly."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall restaurant. Staff was mediocre. Veggie fried momos are delicious. Chicken Nepali is not great but the sides are yummy."}
{"text":"Oooooh, just ate here yesterday and cannot wait to go back!   Two of us shared the vegetable momo and ordered the Nepali vegetable dish and the Indian vegetable curry. The momo dumplings were the kind of chewy that I love, with a delicately spiced filling and a most amazing dipping sauce. The sauce was pretty spicy (I detected what I believe to be habanero, yum!) and it did overcome the aromatic quality of the momo, but it was soooo magical, I would be happy to put it on anything, all of the time! And I was in luck, because more came with the entrees! The Nepali vegetables and the Indian curry were the exact same dish - we didn't mind only because it was especially delicious; appropriately spicy (this time more like chili and/or cayenne), not heavy or oily and decidedly savory (not sweet like some Asian styles) with freshly cooked broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and potatoes.  One of the veggie dishes (not sure if it was the Nepali or the Indian - again they were the same dish), came on a thali style platter with homemade pickles (mild), a little mix of greens and garlic, an *extremely* tasty dal, plus my new favorite condiment. And rice, both entrees came with rice - nothing too remarkable about that, but the rice did seem to have been cooked in a broth, maybe with a little butter (I'm not a fan of that latter bit, but I feel that it indicates particular care in the preparation).   I really, really look forward to returning to Subba (wish it was closer to me)."}
{"text":"The spicy momo appetizer was delicious and had a major kick to it! I had the chicken Bryani- not the restaurant's specialty but wow, they nailed it. Large portion of rice and grilled veggies. We also had the curry, which was made traditional Nepali style and came with lots of side dishes like vegetables and rice. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I stopped by tonight at 5:15pm for dinner with CM after a visit to the Andy Warhol Museum.  A couple of quick tips on finding this place: first, be advised that the location pin on Yelp is a block west of the restaurant's actual location, which is on Cedar St. across from Rita's Italian Ice (the address on Yelp is correct).  Second, although the entrance was clearly marked (under the awning), signage indicating that the banquet room was upstairs was confusing (banquet room = dining room in this case).  Since this place fits the profile of my favorite type of ethnic restaurant (a little-known hole in the wall with great food), and since I'd never tried Nepali food before, I thought we were in for a treat.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  CM and I started off by ordering the momo dumplings (chicken filled), which were okay but just your typical steamed dumpling with a spicy kick.  For our entrees, we ordered from the Nepali section of the menu, with me ordering the chicken and him ordering the fish.  The Nepali entrees are composed similarly to Indian dishes, consisting of a large dish of white rice with a protein in sauce, steamed saag (spinach), daal (lentil soup), a sauce, and a small dish of pickled vegetables, all served on the side (see photo).  We certainly got a lot for the money here, both for the app and entrees!  My principal complaint is that everything was quite a bit spicier than I'd like, since I wasn't asked to specify a spice level.  Both the dumplings and the chicken made my mouth and throat burn, and the amount of spice overpowered, rather than enhanced, the flavor.  I've been to S.E. Asia and have eaten my share of spicy food from this region both there and here, so I can only imagine how Pittsburghers with less tolerance for heat would react.  Worse still, our waiter (who I strongly suspect is the owner) wasn't conscientious about keeping my water glass filled.  When my water ran out, I tried taking a sip of the daal to calm the heat, but this exacerbated the problem, since even the daal was overly spiced (I've never noticed daal being spicy anywhere else).  I ended up just waiting a bit to allow the sensation to die down, which fortunately seemed to do the trick.  I'd strongly recommend ordering a mango lassi to help cool the heat.  Aside from the water filling issue, our waiter never returned to collect payment once he gave us the check.  CM and I ended up going to the front counter to pay our check, which I assume is what's expected, although this is unclear.  There was even a hiccup in paying the check, since the system wouldn't accept CM's Discover card despite signage indicating that Discover is accepted.  As the absolute final straw, the mukhwas consisted only of anise seed, with very few candies sprinkled throughout.  While I'm glad to have had the chance to sample Nepali cuisine, suffice it to say that I'm not in a rush to return, due to the overly spicy food and inattentive service.  Aside from these problems, the flavors of the food just weren't as distinctive--or as delicious--as I was hoping.  It's too bad that this is the only restaurant serving Nepali food in PGH, since I suspect that this place doesn't do it justice."}
{"text":"Four of us wanted to try this restaurant before going to see a show at the Hazlett Theater.  The food was excellent. We tried both the chicken and vegetable momos (steamed dumplings); we liked them both although we all agreed that the chicken was tastier. Among us we also ordered chicken biryani, chicken curry, and a lamb and pork dish. All were good, as was the naan. We ordered primarily from the Nepali and. Indian selections. The portions are generous and the food was very inexpensive ($44 for everything). The service needs some work, so I recommend leaving sufficient time if you are going somewhere afterward. Entrees were brought out one at a time (well, one, then another one, then two), but since we were all sharing it did not matter as much. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Working in Allegheny Center Mall, there aren't a lot of great food options.  I was excited to learn about Subba and was eager to try it for the first time.  The first time I tried to eat here, the \"open\" sign was lit, but the door was locked.  I was glad I had only made a short walk from work rather than a special trip.  I later learned that sometimes they are there and \"open\" but for some reason don't have the door unlocked.  If you ever go and find this to be the case, give them a call and they will likely come down and unlock the door for you.  You enter a side door and have to go up a staircase to enter the restaurant.  Try not to be put off by the barren appearance of the stairs and the basic appearance of the restaurant.  The food is wonderful.  I had the chicken Nepali.  It comes with several sides and each was more deliciuos than the next.  There is a lot of food, so come hungry.  There were some pieces of chicken that were a bit tough, but with as tasty as everything else was, I overlooked it.  I also ordered the momo (dumplings).  They come with this incredibly tasty sauce that has a bit of a zing to it.    If you aren't adventerous enough to try the Nepalese cuisine, they also offer some traditional chinese options and even a few sushi rolls (although all but one was blocked off with tape on my menu).  Overall, a fun and different dining experience.  I recommend giving it a try.  Just make sure you call first to ensure the door is actually unlocked..."}
{"text":"Before we leave Pittsburgh we decided to go back to Subba for dinner. It is superb food. Our dishes were Nepali dishes. Very spicy and delicious. If you travel or live in Pittsburgh...go eat here. The outside of the restaurant is pretty shabby...do not let that deter you. Eat there!"}
{"text":"This place is really nondescript, with a huge clunky door that opens up to a staircase going up to what is essentially an apartment-like space. It certainly was not crowded, and I wonder if it ever fills up. The menu is simple and easy to peruse, and we focused primarily on the Nepali stuff since that's what is supposedly unique here--not sure where else in Pittsburgh this can be found. The momo is a staple, which is a nice fusion of dumpling and curry flavor. More importantly for the Asian palate, the dumpling skin was great texture--not too soft but not too hard either. The thali (lamb, specifically) was tasty and had great variety. While the portion of actual meat was a tad small, the rest of the platter made up for it, with lots of herbs and spices in the sauce for flavor. Definitely reminded me of the Jackson Heights community in Queens, NY."}
{"text":"I LOVE their food, especially the Nepali dishes.   The only caution I give is to perhaps avoid the Szechuan Beef.   When I got it, a lot of the pieces of beef were leather tough and there was not a hint of spicyness in this. I hope it was just a fluke/one time thing."}
{"text":"About time I did a real review! So the food here is spectacular! Makes you feel horrible about the food you used to think was good! The temp was great. Hot. The music was soothing... Only issue, we received the chicken Nepali before our app. When the 2nd entree came, so did another Nepali chicken. Everyone was confused. The first dish was for a different table."}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a Friday night. Don't let the location deter you! It was super good and made up for the lack of Asian cuisine in the North Side. We tried both the Nepali food and the more traditional food and both were great!"}
{"text":"I just had my first Subba experience today as takeout, and I have to say, I'm impressed! Cheap and delicious. I got the Nepali chicken and veggie momo. The nepali dishes come with a gravy-style main (think indian curries), some amazing dal, and some veggies in a dry sauce. All of it was delicious! The guy asked me if I wanted it spicy or medium and I said somewhere in between. Be warned, they are generous on the heat. Maybe not for you if that's not your thing. But I happen to love it, so I was very pleased! The sauce for the momo set my mouth on fire, but it was delicious. The momo had a thick, chewy consistency to the dough, which is something I really love in a dumpling. The filling was moist and beautifully spiced. And I could eat a gallon bucket of that dal. The chicken appeared to be boneless thigh pieces, and the flavor was excellent. It was quite a bit of food and definitely made a pretty big lunch and dinner for me. At $15 for two full meals, I'm very pleased. All in all, this place is great. I can see how the service might be slower sometimes due to a very small staff, but it appears to be a small, family-owned place and everything else about it makes any potential wait worth it. I'd rather have a bit of a wait than see the prices go up if they hired more staff, but I'd love to see an awesome place like this grow and be successful in the area!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place couple of times in the past. Earlier the food used to be great.But recently it seems the cook/cheif got changed and the food quality has detoriated since then. I ordered sadako pork and chicken and the food was super super spicy. There were red chilly powder and some chillies too all over the food. Momos also were not properly fried and the edges were uncooked."}
{"text":"It didn't look like much from the outside, but it was a fabulous little Napolese place! The owner works there all the time and I think he is the main cook. I had never had Napoli food before, but it was very interesting. Lots of spices but not necessarily spicy. They also have other Indian- and Asian-based food on their menu. We tried the momo appetizer (tasty little won-ton-like dumplings) and the Chicken Napoli was our main meal. Worth going into the nondescript door and up the stairs!"}
{"text":"Subbas's asian restaurant is unique and worth visiting if you are in the mood for authentic Nepalese food - an apparent marriage of Indian and Chinese cuisine - in a \"no-frills\" atmosphere. The selections we had were outstanding.  The menu is large and tries to hit on many Asian cuisines including sushi. I would never order sushi here - more on that below. We stuck to other Yelper's suggestions on what to eat.   Sadako chicken - sauteed (fried?) crispy chicken with spices, onion and cilantro, tart lemon. A great appetizer or even light entree.   Pan fried Momo - more traditional dumplings steamed then browned. Great spicy dipping sauce.   Nepalese chicken - braised in curry-like sauce with light al dente rice that looked like it had been lightly fried, and came with nice sides (daal - chickpeas/potatoes, saag - sauteed greens) two sauces and \"pickles.\" This dish was great, we shared everything which was enough for two. Prices are reasonable to cheap.   There is a downside. The ambiance needs major improvement. This is not a first date place or even a business lunch place. We were hoping the drab exterior was not representative of what was inside but the interior was very drab, a bit too warm for a summer day and smelled like incense. All the blinds were down - maybe the a/c was broken(?). There are several doors you have to open to enter the restaurant all of which were visibly dirty, filthy.  There was a door open to the kitchen right when you walk in and the kitchen looked dirty. The white walls appeared dirty. There was visible leak damage apparent on the ceiling and peeling plaster on the walls. The upside was that the tables were clean,  as well as the bathrooms and service was fine though a little help on the menu would be welcome. They did make the effort to put some chachkies around for decor.   I hope the owners read and take this criticism and make improvements to the space - very easy fixes - a fresh coat of paint, dont burn incense, and clean the doors! I really want to be supportive of good local restaurants and i dont need frills to be happy. There was literally no one in the place on a Saturday afternoon. I hope they can improve the space to bring in more customers."}
{"text":"For food preparation, presentation 3 stars..service 3 stars...the interior is a 1 star...since the front door could use a good cleaning and the entry floor a little sticky.  The price for the food earns 3.5 stars and the amount of food generous. We were a larger group and were accommodated well. I would return if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"First impressions were not good - solid steel door off Cedar Av was filthy and it looked like we might be entering a bar of some sort. But we were hungry and google maps had led us to this \"Asian fusion\" place. The one sweaty guy we saw working as host/waiter/and perhaps also as cook was pleasant enough, but the walls were filthy and decor drab. Menu was a mix of basic \"Chinese\" dishes and some \"Indian\" plates like biryani chicken. Food was just ok - not super fresh and colorful - and I got sick with stomach distress, etc."}
{"text":"Came here with my buddy and we split the Sadako chicken and Nepali Chicken. The Sadako chicken was incredible. The Nepali chicken came with a bunch of side dishes and was pretty good. It was the perfect amount.  I'd say the food was 5 stars but the service was a 3. We were pretty thirsty when we got in and finished our waters quickly and they didn't end up giving us water until we were almost done with the meal."}
{"text":"As much as I would love to leave an actual review, this is all I can give because they won't answer their phones for a take out order. I've called five times, even making sure it was the right number by confirming on Google. I just want some takeout! Geeze.  Revision: I saw a different number on their website and asked to place a takeout order. A man asked to call him back in 15 minutes because he wasn't at the restaurant. I asked if anyone was there and he said no. Am I in the twilight zone?!"}
{"text":"Overall a great spot for a low cost lunch or dinner that's different from most other Asian places. They have a varied menu so the non-adventurous can enjoy fried rice or general tsos chicken. The real treats are the momos (veggie were better tasting and spicier than meat option) as well as the Nepalese plates. Parking is pretty easy. There were plenty of spots on either side of Cedar.   The only drawback was that we were a group of 13 people. Sometimes we had to grab the waiters attention for water or  to ask about something. As well, they forgot two plates of food but everything else came out quickly, hot and delicious! They were gracious about splitting checks and having some pay with cash, others with card.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out since it's in my neighborhood and has been getting great reviews.  We went on a Wednesday night, and it wasn't busy but service was slooooooow.  We walked in and stood at the door for about ten minutes, because although there were 3 tables of diners and a few people waiting for food, there were no employees to be found.  We were seated and then left alone to peruse the menu.  We ordered within ten minutes--I got the veggie nepali plate, the husband got sesame chicken, and we got veggie momos to share.  And then we waited.  And waited, and waited.  Two couples walked in and walked out while we waited, because the only employees at the restaurant were in the kitchen the whole time (?).  The momos came and they were AMAZING.  Flavorful, with a delicious spicy sauce.  The food came, and it was just okay.  Kinda lukewarm.  My plate was very similar to the thali plates I have had at various Indian places, but honestly, I liked them better at the other places.  I may go back for momos and to give this place a second chance--but I will DEFINITELY be calling it in, or bringing at least one bottle of wine, because start-to-finish we were there over two hours, and had been planning on a quick meal.  Yikes!"}
{"text":"The neon flashing Open sign got my attention and called me into the doorway around the corner from East Ohio Street and the Park House. Subba overlooks the Park and is three blocks from Allegheny General Hospital. Stumbled on this second floor Northside no-frill bargain eatery. Pittsburgh has a Bhutanese refugee community and this restaurant is the result. Started with Momos- a dumpling that was very good. We also started with an appetizer Chicken Sadaka that was up spiced with chilis and was a stir fry of veggies and chicken. Great flavor- dry chicken- very good flavor. For the entree we had the Subba Special Combo. Again a blend of wonderful chili spiciness- the Bhutanese stir fry was over loaded with lamb, shrimp, beef, broccoli, cauliflower, onion, cabbage. I would have this again but not the combo- too many proteins in one dish for me. I would pick one. I want to return and try more dishes.They have a Nepalese menu that I would like to try. They also have Chinese and Indian sections of the menu. Subba is a rare find and should be tried. The steep staircase in not for all. The place is gritty right down to random decor and the mouse traps. Support our Pittsburgh immigrant community and eat here. All are welcome here. The flavors are great and the price is right."}
{"text":"First time having Nepal food. Best I can describe it is Chinese with curry. I was very impressed with the quality of ingredients.  I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great stuff, friendly owner, not the Ritz but the food is great.  This is somewhere between Tibet, Nepal and Beijing.  Truly a unique mix and very relaxing atmosphere.  Go there!  Get the Nepalese version of Thali if you're hungry..."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Nepali food and it was such a great experience. They had great vegetarian options, very large portions, for very affordable prices. I had the vegetarian Nepali platter, it was filling and delicious. Our service was also excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"From out of town and feel lucky to have decided on Subba. The Chicken with Vegetable Nepalese style is fantastic."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall Nepalese/Indo-Chinese restaurant on the North Side.  I never knew it was there until my friend suggested it. It looks a little sketchy from the outside but inside it is comfortable and nicely decorated.  It was a bit on the warm and stuffy side though when we were there, as the Spring temperatures had started to warm up but they hadn't turned on their AC or fans yet.    I had some of the momos (Nepalese dumplings) for an appetizer and the nepalese lamb for my entree and everything was delicious.  They don't let you specify your spice level, but it was fine for me since I found it to be perfectly spiced.  However, if you don't like spicy food this might not appeal to you, since it was a bit on the spicy side.  The Nepalese dishes are served \"Thali\" style which means they are composed by a variety of small dishes in little bowls on a larger plate.  Prices were very reasonable.  The server was very friendly and helpful, though toward the end when we were trying to pay he did disappear for a bit and we had to find him.  The place is BYOB and they brought a wine opener and glasses for us but we had to open our own bottle.  They were a little slow on clearing old dishes from the appetizers when bringing out entrees, but otherwise service was good.    I might give this 3 stars if this were just an Indian or Chinese restaurant, but given that this is the only Nepalese I know of in Pittsburgh it provides a more unique experience than you might find elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Nepalese/Indian restaurant and this is coming from people who have lived in India and eaten Indian in the UK and throughout the US. Everything was good, but you must get the Chicken Momo and the Masala Tea/Chai. The dumplings are some of the best we've had (and we lived and traveled in China too), and the chai is the wonderfully creamy, sweet chai that you can get at any roadside stand in India and only very rarely in the US. Our entrees were excellent as well - the Chicken Datsi was creamy and delicious and the Nepali Chicken was an excellent sampler of various salads and dishes. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"SETTING: \"Hole in the wall\". Located on the second floor. Clean inside, no frills when it comes to decor. The focus is on the food.     FOOD: Full disclosure: first time having Nepali food, so to be fair I don't have anything to compare it to. But I will say that it does remind me of the \"typical\" indian cuisine in terms of spices, spiciness, and flavor. I had the Pan fry momo and Napali Chicken.    Pan fry momo appetizer was solid. Came with 8 fried dumplings (think potstickers) and a dipping sauce. I love potstickers, so this was just what I imagined it would taste like, with some indian-like spices infused into the meat filling inside. Definitely gave it an extra kick!  The Napali chicken came on a large plate full or rice, with the chicken itself in a small bowl simmering in a sauce, some \"gravy\"? (excuse my ignorance...I never had Napali food before!), and some tiny sides of veggies. Overall, it tasted good and all the flavors came together wonderfully. Although, I really was hoping there would be more chicken. There were maybe 4 pieces in that small bowl--it almost felt like it was a side dish and not actually part of the main entree. With the sauce (a savory, runny texture) that came with the chicken and all the sides, it was very easy to clean the plate and be satisfied.   SERVICE: I think the owner was the one who brought out the food, and he was a sweet gentleman. It always warms my heart when I see an honest person that may have immigrated to the states, working hard in a restaurant to share his country's culture with others. The place wasn't too busy, so the waits were not too long. You are not approached very often for water refills or other things, but I think they would be available if you ever needed something. Very low key.     IMPRESSIONS: If you cannot handle spicy, then you might want to rethink your visit. Or you can tell them to go mild on your dish. Everything was good and prices were fine, but the experience was not really too memorable, other than the fact this was my first time having Nepali food. Again, I really admire the owner's hard work, so hat's off to you, sir. Keep doing your thing!"}
{"text":"I expected to drop a 5 star, but cannot. First, kudos to Subba for transforming a drug infested crime laden after hours spot into a family restaurant! Onto the food... J had the vegetarian Nepalese platter. It was spiced with garam masala which gave it a warm character and slight heat factor. The veg mix was carrot, broccoli, onion and a potato or two in a thick gravy. A large plate of rice accompanied the bowl as did two additional sauces and a pickled side dish. My lunch mate ordered a lamb dish and this is where I'm knocking off stars. Half of the meat was clearly past prime and mixed with fresher meat. That's a problem. We brought it to the servers attention and nothing was done to correct this situation. All in all this is a nice addition to East Ohio. Even my carnivore buddy said he'd come back. He just might go vegetarian:)"}
{"text":"First of all let me just say this place is an experience in itself. I've not found food that is quite like this in Pittsburgh.   I went with my girlfriend on a weekend, they had 4 or 5 tables. The service was okay, and by that I mean it took our server 10 minutes to get us water. He was running around doing a lot of things but we felt ignored for a lot of the time we were there.   The momos are what sold this place for me! They were delicious, and it was a great portion size.   Wonton soup was seasoned pretty well. Hot and sour soup was okay, it's not something I would ever order again.   I ordered the chicken Nepali and it was good! I has never had Nepali food until I came to Subba. The dish was really fun to figure out what everything was and how it tasted. It felt super authentic and the spices were spot on!   You really get a bang for your buck at this place. A lot of food and great flavors all around! I'd like to come back and try their Chinese food."}
{"text":"Great food. I was really surprised at the quality of food and service offered here, as the entranceway is a bit daunting. The restaurant is on the second floor and is very nice."}
{"text":"This review is based on one visit.  As I approached the door I saw the sign and proceeded to open the door. I immediately thought of Tina B's review where she mentions the rundown appearance and wanting to turn around. I however was expecting this, as I did my Yelp review reading beforehand.   The restaurant was mostly empty and it was just our large group and another (rather drunk cheerful and lively) large group. I think they had way more wine than us (quality not quantity)!  We ordered an array of appetizers, they were tasty. I liked the spicy vegetable mono, which was mentioned in several Yelp reviews I read prior to my arrival.   I ended up ordering the Lamb and Vegetable Nepali dish. The lamb and veggies came one one plate sitting in a generous base of some sauce. The other plate was white rice, nothing crazy about it (some reviews mentioned weird rice).  The meat was juicy and although there wasn't a ton of it, I was full.   The prices are pretty decent so I would just order a variety of dishes and experiment with something new, take the rest home.  Love that it's BYOB, I would return."}
{"text":"Family owned and talented owner/Cheif. The Nepalis food is beautiful. you get the feeling you are eating food made at grandmas house. (if she was from Nepal) The Resturaunt is on the second story in a busy street across from park in North side. the door is... well kinda crazy. but don't let it stop you... let it add charm... then cling the stark steep stair well... will just add to your adventure. Upstairs its super roomy and the owner actually built the booths! he is a jack-of all trades. Do also try his homemade hot sauce. He cooks in Gee (refined butter) which is traditional. For me this means I can eat very little on the menu... but I often get his lo-mein with extra brocili and tons of hot sauce (seems masala based). Word from my friends is his \"Chinese food\" is zesty and special too."}
{"text":"I dined here as it was convenient to the hospital at which my wife was having a surgical procedure performed, and the restaurant received a favorable review just this week in Pittsburgh CityPaper.    I arrived at a couple of minutes after opening time of 11:00 a. m. and the place was not set up for business.  The gentleman who opened the door at the top of the stairs told me that he would turn the lights on, and he did so that I could proceed up the steps.  The restaurant is not modern or beautiful, but I like that it is spacious and that the tables and booths allow for the ability to speak without having to raise one's voice.  I was the only person dining for the time that I was there, about forty minutes.  The menu is red plastic and says \"Fine Foods\".  It is obviously a remnant from some other restaurant of long ago.   I like that one has a selection of Indian, Chinese, or Nepalese dishes.  I ordered egg roll (four pieces for $2.55, a very nice sized appetizer for one and ample for two), and chicken lo mein for $6.95.  The prices were fair for the portion sizes and the food was tasty.    The lo mein dish contained many pieces of succulent chicken, but it was spicy, something I have not encountered in this dish before, and which is not indicated in any way on the menu.  I would have preferred less spice.  What was greatly disappointing was the lack of attention I received.  The server/owner brought one glass of water that was mostly ice, and which was quickly emptied.  There was no refill, no quality check, and not a great deal of pleasantness.  The gentleman simply brought the dishes to the table, nothing more.  If this were my restaurant and it was relatively new, and with only one customer, I would certainly try to make the individual feel that he and his business were appreciated.  I received no sense of that.  The restaurant is open from 11 a. m. to 10:00 p. m. seven days a week.  It is not in an area in which I would feel safe after dark.  This is not a place I would go out of the way for, but it is fine for a good lunch when one is in the area."}
{"text":"I will be honest - I love Nepali spices, flavors and the presentation so much that I admit it would be hard to give an authentic meal a bad review.  The Nepali meals are so delicious. Within a week, I am craving it again. I also love the momos of course and the masala chai is the best I've had in the city. My only regret is not finding out about this place sooner!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Must try the momo and sadoko chicken! You will become addicted. The service is lacking mostly because they do not usually have enough staff. But I believe as this place becomes more popular, they will fair better in that area. Still 5 stars, in my opinion, because of the food. I have taken many friends here and everyone was always impressed."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap. Large portions. Up some sketchy steps to the second floor. Ate naan, noodles and Nepalese chicken. All of it excellent. Kids loved it. The staff was nice and friendly looking to please."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices. Good food. This place looks completely different than the last time I visited. I was here Friday night and place looked very busy. Try all the apps. I if you are into hot stuff ask the waiters for nepal style.   BOYB is the best part. You will find a some groups with lot of empty bottles of wine and perhaps drunk and living the life.   Overall the food is great."}
{"text":"The food was very good, had a vegetable dish which came to $9.58 including tax. The weird part was when I went to pay my bill the man pointed to a handwritten note saying credit card charges have to be at least $10. I pointed out that when I add the tip, it would be over $10...language barrier...didn't understand that. He insisted on rounding the bill up to $10 so that it would meet their self-imposed minimum charge. FYI, a minimum charge of $10 (but no more) is now allowed as long as they impose it on ALL types of credit cards that they accept."}
{"text":"This was great. The sadako pork was excellent (a spicy crispy pork and cabbage and lime salad). So were the Nepali chicken and lamb thali dinners. The pickles and vegetables especially were flavorful and excellent."}
{"text":"Great, spicy food! I never have had Nepalese cuisine before so I do not have anything to compare it to, but it was delicious! Very simple restaurant inside, if you're looking for ambiance look elsewhere. But the food speaks for itself and is yummy!"}
{"text":"As most of the other reviewers have mentioned, this restaurant is very unassuming.  You enter from a side door, go up the steps to the second floor and enter the restaurant. The decor isn't anything exciting, but often times those are the best restaurants. It was also very clean feeling, despite the lack of ambiance, and the prices are extremely reasonable.   We went with a large group (9 of us) and split two orders of momos for the table.  Everyone enjoyed them and the dipping sauce was amazing.  The sauce was a tad on the spicy side, so keep that in mind if you're not a fan of spicy things. They look like a pot-sticker, but have a completely different flavor profile, which, having never eaten Nepalese food before, I really enjoyed.   Everyone ordered various Nepali plates.  My husband ordered the lamb, and I ordered the pork.  The plates come out with a variety of items to add to your rice, including the same spicy sauce that came with the momos, some lentils, vegetables, and a variety of other options.  I basically dumped everything onto my rice and went to town.  Man, was it delicious!  My only complaint was that my pork had a decent amount of gristle and fat that I had to eat around.   I would love to come back here often and try many of the other menu options.   Definitely recommend it and enjoyed the food immensely."}
{"text":"From the outside this looks like a place you would have to have a special knock to get in by the bouncer or a password.  But, once you walk in it is really nice.  The fusion of cuisine is really great and a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Don't let the entrance fool you. It's a gem! The lamb was so tender and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Subba was my first experience with Nepali food. From Google searches I expected it to be a cross between Chinese and Indian food, which was a pretty accurate assessment. First we had the Sadako chicken, which was crispy and flavorful pieces of chicken tossed with onions, herbs, and lemon. I chose it based on Yelp recommendations and did not regret it. Even after the entrees arrived we still worked to finish the dish. The Nepali entrees (one lamb, one chicken) came with a plate of rice, lentils, vegetables in a sauce, and two different pickled salads. It was delicious. I very much enjoyed my lamb, and my friend talked about his chicken for days after. The flavors and preparation are definitely similar to Indian dishes, but there is a distinct quality to the food. I would surely return if in town again."}
{"text":"This place had great reviews so I thought I would give it a try. The mango lassi was good but the tea with \"Indian spices\" was amazing. We ordered the steamed momo dumplings and they were good the sauce was a little more spicy than you would want. The lassi was a perfect compliment. We tried the chicken and lamb napali dishes. These are spicy. Very good but spicy. This was a nice touch of out of the ordinary but I don't need to go back. Unless they start serving that tea to go."}
{"text":"Great place! Momos were excellent and u can tell they are handmade. Simple decor but the food males up for it . The service was awesome ,everyone was nice. Had the chicken Nepali which was a huge portion. Amazing flavors and fresh. Will definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"Subba is a simple, local Nepalese/Indo-Chinese restaurant located on the 2nd floor of a building on Cedar Ave. on the Northside.  The entrance is non-descript - you would almost miss it if you weren't looking and one must climb 2 flights of stairs to get to the restaurant (note for people with mobility issues).  The space is large with basic decor and the staff was very efficient the night that we went.  They have a range of offerings from basic \"Americanized Chinese food\" to authenic Nepalese and other Asian dishes.  I ordered the shrimp lo mein and my boyfriend ordered the Mongolian Beef while our friends ordered the Lamb Biryani and the Hunan Chicken.  The prices are inexpensive and you get a lot of food for the money - enough to share.  Overall the food is good, and I would like to try the Nepalese food the next time I go.  Definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Subba Subba Subba Subba... Subba! (to the tune of the O'Jays 'For the Love of Money,' because Subba is like money. For your belly.) This place is delicious. The spice profile is fantastic, and the ingredients always seem fresh - which should be a given, but in Pittsburgh you never know...  I go here for the Nepali food (as that's their specialty), so really that's what I'm going to review. The momos are seriously addicting; so very good, and probably like nothing you've tried before. I mean, yes, they are Asian dumplings, but the flavor profile is not ordinary or \"regular.\" Also, the Nepali meals are fantastic, and come in large portions (easily split between two small people) which is a great deal for the price. Plus, the staff is lovely! But coincidentally, therein lies the one drawback... I've never seen more than two people working there at once, and while it is charming and quaint (and again, they are the nicest!) it can make for a bit of a wait. They are always apologetic, and trying their best, but I put this caveat in here for folks who are looking for a quick bite. Maybe it can be quick, but I've always waited longer than I would have expected to. Not excessive or ridiculous, just longer than one would guess for a small, no frills Asian joint. That being said - I think it's worth it! And will continue to wait if need be, because once you've had it, you will crave it - and no other type of food will suffice. Seriously, try this place."}
{"text":"Get all that fine Nepalese food down my gullet! They also have some of the best American Chinese food in the city. Go here. Go often. It's beautiful."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Lo Mein noodles ever! I think sometimes Lo Mein can feel weighted down and soggy, but these noodles were fresh and delicious! Highly highly recommend giving them a try."}
