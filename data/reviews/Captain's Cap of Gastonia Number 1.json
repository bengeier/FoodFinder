{"text":"My husband and I ate there for the first time about a month ago.  Our food was simply delicious and I loved the salad bar.  It was simple and not overloaded with to many different vegetables.  The waitress was very nice and very attentive.  Definitely looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Last time we eat here, after voting we stopped in nice clean place but, we both felt sick afterwards."}
{"text":"It's good fish they cook the fish just the way your grandmother would free salad  bar sweet tea all ready on the table but I need unsweetened tea and I got just that"}
{"text":"Great seafood. The portions are generous and come with an all you can eat salad bar. The service is also prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"*****  WARNING: Gross-out alert!   *****   


Have eaten here a few times. Sadly, the last time was THE last time.

Great service. Friendly staff. Decor dated but not so bad. If you have hemorrhoids, be warned: the benches are wooden and HARD.

My food was not hot. Barely lukewarm. No way to eat a fry.

Salad bar is okay if you're in desperate need of roughage. The only greens are iceberg lettuce, pickles, and jalepenos.

Thank God I just happened to be up at 3 a.m. because that's when the stomach cramps started. I was able to exit the bathroom around 4 a.m.

I'll be checking the news today for a food poisoning outbreak.

Seriously."}
{"text":"Got the family flounder pack take out. Fish, fries, and hush puppies were great. Slaw was gross. Over all $20 to feed a family we were pleased."}
{"text":"Honestly the service is like third grader capability.  Carry out is like checking a third grader and eat-in is not much better the waitresses talk too much rather than serving the patrons.  This used to be a decent place but the owners are totally out to lunch as far as managing this restaurant.  A much better restaurant is Surf and Turf a few miles away in Bessemer City.  Congratulations competent staff and better food and not as greasy."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Liked the salad bar, hush puppies, baked potato and the fried felit of flounder. Portions of the fish are huge, definitely good for sharing."}
