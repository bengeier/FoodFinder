{"text":"First, great service, super nice and super helpful folks behind the counter.  Whoever was playing DJ was on point...PJ, sound garden, STP and so on. The dining area is clean. 

The dogs are top notch, the brat is a brat if you like brats, next time I would ask to leave the green peppers off, but that's one me. 

They have beers on tap...deschutes ipa, fresh squeezed. 

Nice service, clean dining area, excellent dogs and cold IPA...what else do you want?

If this place doesn't make you happy, you're the problem, not it."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Bacus Bros. Our sever Lissette was very helpful and made us a great hot dog with the works! The french fries are great! They also have a good section of beer. I need to go back during happy hour!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place for a hot dog.  The OG was great, bread was awesome.  The staff was friendly and eager to help.    They have a good variety of beer both on tap and in bottles.  The onion rings were the worst part but they were still pretty dang good.  This would be a restaurant for me if I lived in this area."}
{"text":"im not even into hotdogs and sausages but man this place is great. foood is a must try. staff is friendly and really is a great place for quick food at a very good price."}
{"text":"Great food! I've lived in germany and can't complain about there bratwurst.  The prices were good considering the downtown Tempe location. One of e best hotdog joints. Only thing that would make it better would be to have a south eastern dog with chile and slaw!"}
{"text":"Even though my first time,  made to feel at home by the great ladies at the grill.   I'm on East coast time so my dinner was not at peak times but every thing was hot,  fries crisp,  helpful to make my pick.   A must stop."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sun Devil Dog with fries to go. Really, really good hot dog--until I found a long hair in my food. It was 5 stars leading up to this point, which is why they're getting more than a 1. Keep up the great food, but perhaps ask your employees to wear hair nets."}
{"text":"They way I was treated when I walked in the door is exactly what other businesses should copy and paste. 
You might ask, how can you screw up a hotdog??? It's actually pretty easy. They have a huge selection of dogs and traditional and unique toppings to choose from, and my food was exceptional! 
I'll definitely return and try others dogs for sure!
Thanks for the get customer service!"}
{"text":"I have had Lots of Hot Dogs and Brats in my Life. Especially when I lived in Germany. but the Brats here where the best I have ever had. Plus the Chili Cheese Fries Where to die for.
Truly a new Favorite."}
{"text":"First time in for lunch while out shopping. Very simple concept, easy to enjoy. Helpful & informative staff, delicious brat. Hard to find a good brat in the valley, let alone on mill. Noticed Sunbru on the beer list, so will be back in during evening hours. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"The chili is fantastic and the wieners really are huge! I like pretty simple dogs so I got a brat with chili and shredded cheese. I was definitely impressed with the portions so I will definitely be coming back! The only other hot dog place off mill (that I know of) is Thirsty Dog and Bacus Bros blows them out of the hot dog stand. Fast, simple, and low key! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazingly good hot dogs. I had the Sun Devil and it was exceptional and huge. Fantastic onion rings. Good beer selection."}
{"text":"Looking for a late night meal after 11 hours and two flights. HOLY geez, you guys. These wieners rocked my world. I ordered the Train Wreck -no sour cream, and the O. G. w/bacon added. My hubby ordered the B2 Bomber w/a pretzel bun. Plenty of food, two dogs would've been enough food but after a travel day we were ravenous and ate all three without a problem. That being said, they have sides like fries, onion rings, and cole slaw- so next time I'm in PHX I'll just order the one and a side. Service was tops and the condiments are legit. Beer on tap is always a  plus! IPAs help cut the heaviness."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing, (Believe me when I say they have the best beans) but the owners and staff are extremely friendly and helpful. This place just became a new personal favorite"}
{"text":"The customer service at Bacus Bros was exceptional. We were greeted immediately and offered advice on what to order. They were so friendly and so kind and the food was delicious. The place was clean and you could tell it was run well. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's game time here in Tempe. The food is great. Try the Polish. Beer selection is good. And the service is impeccable. You won't be disappointed unless another Trump supporter walks in and toots his horn."}
{"text":"Super cool people working here! They have a great selection for vegetarians and vegans. Solid options for toppings, and the prices are reasonable. Also, it's just ridiculously tasty! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for dogs and brats with a great variety of toppings!   The wife got the OG dog and said it was wonderfully unusual and the pretzel bun was fantastic!   As a Chicago girl she had to it was completely different than a Chicago dog so this Arizona boy wouldn't get Cocky!"}
{"text":"HUGE delicious wieners!  Friendly staff & a good beer selection.  That's all you need to know.  

My husband and I checked this place out this past Saturday and had a great time.  We ordered some o rings ($3.50) to share, which were very tasty in all their batter-dipped, golden brown, crispy goodness.

He ordered the Trainwreck ($8.50) and I ordered the Hair of the Polish Dog ($8.50) and changed it up a little.  I had them leave off the spicy mustard and the green peppers and add avocado, which isn't sliced avocado.  It's a green paste that looks like someone already ate it, but it tasted good so that's all that matters.  He had a Lagunitas IPA ($4) which is always a good choice, and it was a nice late lunch.   As my grandma used to say, \"Go grab a wiener!\""}
{"text":"Friendly, helpful staff with terrific hot dogs-regular, chicken sausage, Polish, or Italian.  I loved that you could make up your own dog with their large number of toppings or try ones they had tested. They even gave my husband a sample. I'd go there again and again."}
{"text":"All I can say is get the \"TRAIN WRECK\".  Add the homemade relish on it.  Enough said."}
{"text":"I checked this place out for the first time tonight after wanting to for several weeks now. Damn, I wish I wouldn't have waited so long. The food was absolutely delicious. I got a pretty basic chili cheese dog with raw onions. The dog was grilled to perfection and they don't skimp on the toppings! And the fries...so good. Awesome beer selection for such a small place, too. The staff was very friendly and offered their knowledge and assistance. The decor is cool...modern vibe with quality 90s hip hop playing through the speakers. Very clean. And, while its not my thing, they do offer vegetarian and vegan options as well. My buddy who I went with prefers that diet, and he said everything he had was well above par. I can't eat hot dogs every day, but at least now I know of a quality spot other than Ted's when I do get the craving. I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Man. Visited Bacus Bros today after seeing some reviews on Yelp! and knew I had to try it out.  I got the \"ICH LIEBE DICH BRAT\" less the grilled onions and peppers (saurkraut and spicy brown mustard only) on the pretzel bun and it was awesome! Great snap and internal tenderness of the brat. Wouldn't change a thing with that.

I got the onion rings as a side and they rank up there with the best onion rings I've had in the Valley or elsewhere. Breading was awesome and they were fried just right.

This place is a \"must try now\" in my book. I can't wait to go back and try the chili as a side."}
{"text":"Hair of the Polish Dog, the Sundevil, onion rings and fries. 

Really nicely done. Creative with the dogs, generous with garnish.

Staff rocks. Super nice people.

Clean and neat.

Music sucked.

Over all a great experience and I will be back when on that side of town."}
{"text":"Spot on. These loaded dogs will surely not disappoint. A handful of different options to choose from. The pretzel bun was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Wow... The sign in the window says they have huge wieners and they aren't kidding! Hot dog was seriously good, I'm surprised there aren't more people here. Come try it."}
{"text":"These folks have such amazing food and service. Even a simple dog was delicious. 

The prices on beer are gracious and their selection of draft and bottles is awesome.

Location: they're tucked back aways so it's nice and comforting to eat on the patio without all of the hustle and bustle of Mill."}
{"text":"I had to reset my Yelp password so I could leave a review of this place. I was in town for business and wanted something casual and close to my hotel. This place hit the spot! I had the brat and the B2 dog and several craft beers on tap. Everyone was super nice, the service was great and the music was awesome (if you like Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters, Alice In Chains, etc. And I do!). Next time I am in Phoenix I will go out of my way to come here again!"}
{"text":"Great new location! There are a ton of delicious dogs as well as fun combinations. You can pick one of their favs or make your own. They have hot and cold toppings. Hot toppings range from bacon, grilled peppers/onions, nacho cheese, sauerkraut, beans, chili and vegetarian chili! (They also have a veggie dog option.) Cold toppings are tons of a fresh veggies as well as their homemade sweet relish!! Ah the sweet relish is BOMB, and this is coming from someone who never liked relish before trying theirs. They also make their own jalape√±o relish, it's sweet but has a kick. The beans are my favorite side but the French fries are crunchy and perfect too. There are so many combinations to try and it's fun to make your own! The Trainwreck is the best favorite dog, it's a hotdog with nacho cheese, chili, French fries and sour cream!"}
{"text":"Amazing dogs and great customer care. I gorged myself with the Amanda Kay and a side of fries. The hot dog had the perfect balance of spicy, sweet and savory (for my preference). The manager also came up and followed up with how we were doing afterwards. Very recommended! 
The place itself is in he back corner of a bigger pub but not a hard find."}
{"text":"I came here at 9pm and the sign on the door said they were closing at 10pm. The door was locked and the people in the restaurant were cleaning up. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume the sign on the door was wrong so I knocked several times and pointed to it. For ten minutes. They aggressively avoided eye contact with me and looked at each other, laughing and chuckling. As if I'm the crazy one for knocking on the door when they should be open according to the sign they put out on their door.

If you want bad service from all around incompetent and rude people, Bacus Bros is the place for you."}
{"text":"Don't miss this place! The food is delicious and the staff is very helpful in giving recommendations. The location is very convenient as it is right off the main drag through Tempe's Mill Ave. I got the Ich liebe dich bratwurst and it was delicious. The fries were tasty and crunchy and just how I like them. And remember they have 'huge wieners' and 'hot buns.' Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Great food, large beer selection, and great service! They have a big menu of 'dogs and lots of beer to choose from - including local brews. Staff is always friendly.
French fries/sides could be a bit bigger portion wise, but I am a big eater..."}
{"text":"Bomb hot dogs. Bomb topping selection. Killer beer. They have military discount. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Not much to say other than we will be back! I want to try all the different dogs.

The menu has a lot of options and good choices for even picky eaters. 

Next time I will get a beer with my dog."}
{"text":"Amazing gourmet hot dogs. Meats are great quality, fresh baked bun options, and tons of fresh veggies to pile on top! The Amanda Kay with jalapeno relish and hair of the polish are my faves. Fries are amazing, I won't go anywhere else for french fries now!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Awesome food!! Highly recommended!! Hot dog was amazing the bun made it even better!!"}
{"text":"Very creative with the menu, high quality dogs/sausages are the base, and you could make any kind of dog you want, lots of great homemade sides like the potato salad.  Boy are they filling too.  Good beers on tap.  Nice guys work/own the place."}
{"text":"High quality food and a great staff. Wife and I went in while spending the weekend in Tempe. The ladies behind the counter were pleasant, helpful and served a great dog with plenty of toppings. Would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! These guys rock. This was our first time here. I had the \"train wreck\" loaded hotdog with chili cheese and frys. Great price for the amount of food. Highly recommend!! Great shop guys. Love the environment and the service. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just ate here.  Had the Trainwreck with a side of rings. Best dog I have ever had. Go for the pretzel bun.  The staff is great.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Did huge wieners catch your eye? If it did you are in the right place. This is hot dog place of all hot dog places in Tempe! I love this places concept of the original hot dog and different mixes to polish dogs to your own custom creations! It's locally owned which is awesome, get a dog and get locally crafted beer how amazing is that! When I walked in it wasn't that busy so enough time for me to think about what I should be putting in my mouth. But right away as I walked in I was greeted with excitement from the girl on the line. She guided me right away and then I asked which one was the popular which was the OG but I thought that was too plain for my taste so I decided with her other recommendation which was the Hair Of The Polish, then you choose your bun which they have 3 choices of! I got the pretzel bun which tasted amazing and was soft and fresh. So if your a picky eater, it's loaded with the polish sausage, bacon, egg, chili-style mustard, onion and green peppers oh and can't forget the shredded cheese!  It's worth it's all in glory and I recommend you don't change anything about it! This place is clean and the interior is really nice! Defiantly will be back for those giant wieners and amazing at that! Stay hungry Tempe!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was just amazing. We went in for an early dinner and the staff gave us a friendly hello and explained how the menu works after we admitted it was our first time in. My husband and I got the train wreck dogs with onion rings. Their chili as freaking great and spicy enough to give you that kick you're looking for and perfect with their hot dogs. Onion rings were super good and didn't even have to ask for ranch. Super thumbs up and we will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

3.5 stars?  4 stars?  I'm hovering, not quite sure.  Been here a couple times and there are things that I love and things that I'm wholly unimpressed about with this place.

No complaints about atmosphere or service.  I love the wide variety of mustard they have.  I do not doubt the quality of the sausages they use, must be quite good.  

What brings this place down a bit are a couple principles.  1.  You can have too much of a good thing.  2.  Dogs can be overdressed.  As to number two, I think the dogs suffer a bit from over-mustarding and over-dressing in general.  Note to self - I can ask for less in the future, and I plan to.  But for the couple times I've gone, it was a little much.  As to number one, it goes more to size-to-value ratio.  These dogs are bigger than your average, and the price corresponds, but does that make up for any deficiencies in taste?  I'm not so sure.  The best Sonoran dogs get this right - value good, normal sized, but incredible taste.  Not sure if this place hits every single note. 

I've had the Ich Liebe Dich Brat and the O.G.  The O.G was quality but nothing spectacular.  And ich liebe brats, but I could not liebe this one.  I like it, just not liebe it.  The pretzel roll was a little stiff and after all was piled on there, it was a tad unwieldy to eat.  The flavor was, again, fine.  

So this place definitely deserves more than a straight average 3-star review.  It gets a bump, but still deciding whether it's 3.5 or a full 4.  I'm leaning, with the addition of a good beer selection, towards a 4.  I'll update again in the future."}
{"text":"Great customer service!  The young lady was very polite and friendly. She even remembered my twin girls.

Ordered up the Sun Devil dog again and wasn't disappointed. Look forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean store and mouth watering dogs and brats. If you're in the mood for good eats and good vibes this place will give you both!"}
{"text":"The service was great super helpful, the food was nothing exciting the bun was super dry and the bratwurst was ok for definitely not worth the 7 bucks. The variety of mustards were the only thing exciting"}
{"text":"Could not have asked for a better experience! As soon as we walked in we were greeted with enthusiasm and kindness. The owners were incredibly personable and chatted with us a bit, before and after we ordered. The menu is laid out clearly with a la carte options, as well as a list of favorites. Its like a build your own pizza, but with dogs/brauts. They also cater to vegetarians!!! (veggie dog). The options for toppings are extensive, ranging from the traditional onions and relish to bacon and eggs! Their beans are an absolute MUST, and you will regret it if you don't try their homemade relish. Order a side of onion rings (very tasty as expected) and a cold draft beer....you will be one happy patron."}
{"text":"Delicious made in house relish. Great portions for the right price. You can just sit down and enjoy your dinner with an adult beverage and watch some great basketball. Manager was very friendly and offered great samples. Also made some great suggestions! GREAT FRIENDLY SERVICE!"}
{"text":"My family and I had the best experience and most Amazing hot dogs. They are unique, different, with a kick of bursting flavors. The service was great and they were very attentive. Next time we come back to the states we will definitely stop in."}
