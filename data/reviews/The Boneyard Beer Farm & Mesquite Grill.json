{"text":"I've got nothing bad to say. Came for lunch and ordered boneless wings. Service was quick, food was quick and hot, server didn't hover......just as it should be. Atmosphere was better than expected and the bathrooms were clean. Like I said, I've got nothing bad to say. 

I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"We really like the boneyard.  They're about three blocks down from our house so we walk down occasionally to get drinks or dinner.  I like the zombie-graveyard decor.  Service is usually pretty good, especially in the bar area.  Food is good and they have a great beer list.  We also like that they play cartoons on one of the big tvs.  My husband and I like to go down on Mondays, get buy one get one pizza, share a beer or two, and watch Adventure Time.

Glad to have this in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Sat at bar for over 5 minutes. Three bartenders walked by. Other people sat next to us they walked up and waited on them. Decided to go somewhere else ."}
{"text":"I've had bad food almost every time I go here, and poor service often too. I only go back cause friends like to occasionally. We usually hit up the Thursday late happy hour, where they also a'coz sale ppb boneless wings (which they have served to me frozen inside before). Many times we have come and they are closing early due to not being busy. The only thing saving this place is their big projection TVs."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice and have had positive experiences both times. We sat on the patio both times, which was really nice. It wasn't too crowded either time, so we were seated right away. The service was fast and staff were friendly. The chicken pesto sandwich and the cheeseburger were both delicious! Our favorite beers were on tap too, so that's a plus. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"In the past when we have gone to the Boneyard in Broadview Heights, the food has been tasty but rarely delivered to our table hot. But things have changed! On week ago Saturday, I ordered the chicken and rib combo with steamed vegetables and it arrived piping hot and delicious! My husband ordered the Asian chicken and it too was hot and delicious. Last Tuesday my daughter and I went in for a quick bite and I had their chili which was great and she ordered the pasta marinara with a few meatballs and she said \"Mom, this is as good as any Italian restaurant and it really was. The sauce was excellent but did not drown the pasta. We went back on Saturday night for one of my fave dishes..the chicken appetizer with cold thai noodles. I don't know what's in these noodles but they are so good. If you haven't been to the Boneyard in a while, give it another try. I think you'll like it!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Boneyard many, many times over the past couple years.  I may be a bit biased because I live very close, but the Boneyard has become my \"go to place\" when I want a reasonably priced, good meal with a sports bar type environment.  Food is nothing fancy, but for the prices it is great.  

The best part about the Boneyard are the 4 HUGE projection screen TV's and the stadium style seating that surrounds them.  If you are looking for a place to catch a big sporting event, this place is it.  They also have $2 draft \"beer of the month\" that will range from bud select to Blue Moon, depending on the month.  Last night it was Molson select light or something...not so great.

Also, I never discovered this until many times of going there, but on the other side of the bar alongside the stage are pool tables, air hockey table and some arcade games (big buck hunter!).  Although the pool tables are ridiculously overpriced, that does add some allure.  The air hockey table is GREAT!"}
{"text":"Part of Cleveland's Liquid Living Group, a company that puts out trendy restaurants in downtown Cleveland and surrounding suburbs.  On weekends and during big games it is hard to find a seat around the bar.  They have a nice selection of beers on tap.  I love that they offer Cider Ale on tap, Woodchuck and the seasonal Wyder's Peach."}
{"text":"Great Family friendly sports bar. The food is basic bar food with the best options being burgers/fries or the small pizzas. The beer list is lengthy and has a lot of microbrew options. If you have kids it's a great place to eat or watch a game."}
{"text":"Just came here last night with coworkers for a going away party, absolutely loved it! The waitresses were attentive, efficient and very sweet. They handled our huge party well and the food was definitely worth it. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was really dissatisfied.  Although the service was fine our meals were terrible.  Chicken wrap had no flavor.  The fries were cold and stale, clearly from the night before and the dressing on the salad was watered down. My daughter was afraid to eat the chicken off her salad as it appeared rubbery.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Great food!  Love the steak fajitas wraps, pizza, wings, and cobb salad. Nice portions.  Staff is super nice.  Daniel and Daria make everyone feel welcome while providing incredible service. Consistent high quality food, consistent warm service."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great food and fast service.  They have a great beer selection on draft.  They do have a patio which is not one of my favs but at least they have one.  I do like how there is a separate section for smokers while on the patio."}
{"text":"Good place for large groups to grab a beer and get together.  Food is decent, nothing special.  A pretty standard menu with a few twists."}
{"text":"My buddy and I met for lunch.  I had a Boneyard salad and quesadillas.  The service was fast and the food was decent.  It may not be a four star restaurant but it is a great place for lunch.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have been going here as long as I can remember! The food is always great and the atmosphere is so fun. Loud atmosphere, fun skeletons always scattered around the restaurant. I like their chicken mac and cheese. Also good is their wraps and breadsticks. The chocolate cake for dessert is HUGE! and such a fun treat. I go all the time with my family and its our tradition to eat a cast dinner here for our drama club. Never disappoints, staff is friendly. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night. Was able to get a seat as soon as we got in. They have a large menu. I got the buffalo macaroni & cheese. Very tasty, buffalo chicken in mac n' cheese, delicious. The reason I'm writing the review is because our waiter was very good. We placed our order and i didn't seem like we were waiting long or anything. Our waiter comes out and tells us that our order got stuck in the machine that the kitchen gets and it'd be a little longer. He gave us a free order of nachos and salsa. My husband and I didn't even think it was a long wait. Not only did he offer the nachos and cheese but he was very friendly and did a great job."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to watch any game. I saw the CAVS vs. Celtics and was such a fun and energetic atmosphere. The screens in the back are so large that every seat in the house is a good one. As far as food I like the fries the best. Any kinda fry - you name its awesome. The service is excellent. Last time I was there they charged me .65 cents for a side of honey mustard. The waiter would not take tip that I left him because he felt bad about the restaurant policy!!! Where was this place when I was growing up?!?"}
{"text":"I have to say I was surprised by the prices it seems really pricey for what you get.
I wasn't happy with the service. The food was so so.  I would imagine sitting at the bar would be fun to get drinks.  Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends after dinner for a couple drinks. I ordered my drink and asked for a plastic cup on the side (I dip). Bartender told me she wouldn't give me the plastic cup because it is a tobacco free restaurant. I understand no smoking because of the second hand smoke, but me having smokeless tobacco is not hurting anyone else. Maybe I should have called about the smokers that were about 10 feet from the front door. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I really like their spicy garlic wing sauce and have come here often for wings,  but I find the service at the bar (where I sit as a single guy) to be consistently lackluster and slow to get attention. They also have made the same error in my simple order repeatedly, which is just a further illustration of the lackluster service.). I do enjoy the fact that they have a pear cider on draft."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Burgers are so/so but, the wings are excellent! I've never had raspberry wings before."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, but the waitress was constantly running around, so not to attentive.  My meal was okay, kind of lack luster, but others thought it was bad.  For what you get, its on the pricey side.  Talked to a friend who goes there for the ribs so I may go back, but it won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place. It is what it is, a bar with decent food and usually good service. I don't go in expecting a world class meal. The portions are always enough for the price. It is right up the road so if my wife and I want a quick meal this is usually the place we choose."}
{"text":"Have been many times. Hoping. I am done hoping.  Not sure why they are still open honestly. I guess for a beer and a game it might be ok.  So many better places.  Food and service subpar.  Sad. It is so close to my house.  I would rather stay home and eat crackers, open a beer, and watch reruns on tv."}
{"text":"I returned to this location after a couple of years of avoiding it due to previous experiences.  Should have stayed away.  Ordered a half-slab rib dinner to take out.  Worst ribs I've ever had.  I had a hard time trying to pry the meat off the bones.  The bones seemed over-sized compared to other ribs I've had.  I think it was just a bad cut of ribs, which any good cook would have recognized before cooking them.  These should not have been served to customers.  Really, really, really bad ribs."}
{"text":"short and sweet...

good food (had the BBQ combo which was delicious), great beers and friendly staff.
i'd put off going here for a while but i'm glad we finally went and we'll go back, i'm sure. 

try the wings, they were perfectly made - crisp and well sauced."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and I've never been impressed. Today's experience was so blah that I was moved to write a review. I was with a kiddo who got the pasta with a side of fruit. She got fruit cocktail. Seriously? Ugh. I got a veggie burger. I'm not a vegetarian but I LOVE veggie burgers. This one compared to the frozen veggie burger patties you get at the grocery store. It wasn't pleasant..."}
{"text":"This was not a particularly pleasant dining experience. It is a chain, so I didn't exactly have high hopes. But the service is ultimately what killed it. And the food wasn't all that good either.

The decor makes it seem like it could be a fun place. It definitely feels like a chain, but it has funny signs and whatnot. I sat at the bar area, which was a nice space.

The bartender was not friendly at all and it took awhile before she even came over to take my drink order. She also had little knowledge of what beers they had. The beer offerings were above average and they had way more offerings than a typical chain place. I wanted to drink \"local\" and inquired about what Great Lakes beers were on tap. She recited the names of them, but was unable to tell me what they were (ale, lager, IPA, etc.)

After receiving my beer, she never asked if I wanted to see a menu or anything. About 15 minutes after helping myself to a menu, she noticed the menu in front of me and finally asked if I wanted anything to eat. I ordered a 6-piece wing. They had a good variety of sauces to choose from (garlic, buffalo ranch, cajun, etc.) and categorized them into three levels (essentially, mild, medium, and hot levels). I opted for buffalo hot with blue cheese.

When the wings arrived, they appeared to be of a decent size and meatiness. However, once I started digging in, there was a lot of dark meat and they were undercooked. And, to top it all off, the wing sauce was completely lacking. I'm convinced they must have given me mild instead of hot (despite the receipt saying hot). There was absolutely no heat. You could barely even taste the sauce. And the blue cheese was just bleh.

Overall, a rather disappointing service and food experience."}
{"text":"1st time at the Boneyard. I was excited to try the Ribs. The place was clean and the wait for a table of 8 was very short which surprised me for a Saturday night. That was about it. I ordered a full slab of ribs with a side salad my ribs were cold and way to much BBQ sauce which was good but not great. Some else had a hamburger which he said the patties where very small and was not very good. The server was nice but not very attentive. I really wanted this to be a good place to eat but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'd say this is the upper echelon of bar food.  BBQ chicken pizza is great as long as they don't overdo the sauce.  Irish nachos are super healthy and tasty too.  Love the patio, no real view, but it's just a cool patio and I like drinking in the sun.  Day drinks!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and gotten good and bad service. The food isn't good, but some sandwhiches are. Burgers, you can make a better one on the grill."}
{"text":"for ribs , for environment .
sweet but I like it

{"text":"The set up and decor of this restaurant is really cool.  Lots of huge TVs, many spooky skeletons, interesting signs, etc.  Very casual and fun atmosphere.  The dining area is loud and child friendly.

The food is very average, sort of meh.  The drinks are average.  There isn't a lot of parking in the restaurant's section of the lot - you might need to park closer to the ice cream shop. 

I would recommend the Boneyard for the atmosphere and decor, not so much the food."}
{"text":"If you've been to one Boneyard, you've been to them all.  This place totally fits that bill when it comes to drinks and the crowd but they get bonus points for their sweet tiered seating which makes for a pretty nice sports viewing set-up.  Other than that, it's just the same old Boneyard."}
{"text":"I really like the Boneyard... It's very close to my house so it's quick and easy for a tasty dinner. Tonight my sisters and I went for dinner, and we were seated right away. Even when there's a wait, however, there's plenty to look at with the skeleton decor (there's even an animatronic skeleton playing the piano above the check-in stand) and huge wall of TVs playing sports (with one always playing cartoons for the kids), and the bar is always available for a drink while waiting. 
We ordered the Irish nachos (cheese fries)as an appetizer. They were delicious as usual, covered in cheese and salty, yummy bacon, but they are definitely getting stingier with the portion as they used to be heaped on the plate.  For my meal I went with the chicken bacon ranch personal pizza (I guess there's a bacon theme tonight!). The sauce was incredibly creamy with piles of chicken and bacon on top. The crust was crisp and flavorful. I even had some leftover for lunch tomorrow! Definitely not disappointed"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food and a great place to grab a drink.  Great to watch sports games but also a great place to come on a normal weeknight to get dinner."}
{"text":"Love their draft list and the casual atmosphere after a good round of golf. The food is good and you can watch a ton of sports on their big screens."}
{"text":"Typical suburban theme bar. It's not horrible but it's not good either.

The food is nothing special but the service isn't adequate for the volume of customers they have. In a place where beer is the primary focus, you would expect that they would keep it flowing. I had to wait 20-30 minutes for another beer on a couple of different occasions. Many times, they walked past empty glasses without noticing or asking about another drink.

One more note. The girly drink menus appear to be different. That led to a bit of confusion in our group since some people ordered a drink that others didn't realize existed. Have the ladies compare the menus before ordering.

In short, if you're looking for an experience like TGI Friday's or Chili's but want to be more supportive of local businesses, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Typical bar food. Kids eat free on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Food is good but not great.  Sir please call the boneyard-the ribs should be a lot better. They were pretty tough and hard to cut through even with a steak knife.   Not the best impression for a BBQ joint.  Had a large party of 13 - service was good.  Everyone who had salads loved them-everyone who had ribs was disappointed.  The Cobb salad was a hit.  Go figure."}
{"text":"Love the food here. The server was extremely friendly and nice. Our orders came out almost immediately and were perfectly done. Their chicken sandwiches are so amazingly juicy and flavorful. I love the cold Thai noodles and could almost lick the bowl afterward.

Inside has a great \"bone\" theme, a wall of TVs, and a nice patio. It's just a little small, especially compared to the Mayfield Heights location and is missing the giant room of video games. I think the bar area is nicer and actually has some windows so it feels a bit warmer than Mayfield's.

Honestly, if I only had one restaurant to visit in Cleveland, this would be it."}
{"text":"me and my friend went here one time cause we were feeling down and the waitress made us feel so much better she was nice and funny and she was fast with getting us our food and was so helpful on what dishes to pick i would recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"Good place to watch a game! Overall, it's basically what you'd expect for that. Pub/burger style food at \"normal\" prices with a friendly server. Nothing spectacular,  nothing bad lol :) The huge screen is really cool though, you can see the game from almost anywhere.

We went here and got a table for 10. We had good service and decent burgers. Our food came out fast. One of the beers my husband ordered came out warm and flat. It our server replaced it no problem. Stephanie was friendly and nice and I'd recommend her as a server :)"}
{"text":"During my stay in Cleveland for Thanksgiving, me and my cousins finally decided to go out on the town for Friday night. We met up with one of my cousins who was getting off work and came here.

First, it reminds me a bit of Hard Rock Cafe as they have 4 large screens for watching sports-so I was thrilled to be plugged back into the sports scene after 2 days away from ESPN.

The service seemed to be pretty good and they kept checking on our group. I went with a Great Lakes Christmas Ale, which wasn't too bad and sampled some of their chips.  Overall I thought the venue wasn't too bad.

The only reason that I knock it down to 3 stars, is that the servers kicked us out of the dining area at 1am. They wanted to close the dining area and have us move over to the bar area.  That just didn't seem to jibe well with me, as we had spent $30 on food and now were having to give up our spot. Additionally, the bar was going to close in a hour anyway, so why not just let us hang out at the table area for a little longer?"}
{"text":"Service: 4/5 The service I received was good. Drinks were refilled and the server was friendly even when I split a dish.

Food: 5/10 Fake BBQ. Ribs were bad for the price and definitely not smoked or smoked enough time to notice. Put that 20$ in the \"buying your own smoker\" fund. But, the wings were good and so was the BBQ flavor BBQ sauce.

Extras: 5/5 Watching a game here would a blast, more tha worth it.

Overall:14/20 It's a cool casual hangout for beers, a tribe game, and some wings. I would sign up for that any day."}
{"text":"Love the live music on the weekend. The crowd is usually pretty cool. But I'm typically not a big fan of chain restaurants/bars. This is no exception. The boneless wings I ordered were not good. They were extremely salty. The beer selection is decent. They have a ton of tvs with sports playing. The wait staff have always been good to me. I will return but only because of the live music."}
{"text":"Management was kind to reach out to me and personally extend an offer to make up for the most recent visit that I had there.  Thank you very much."}
{"text":"Fantastic place always a good draft menu good food good service two pool tables that are normally open no reservations for the pool tables overall nice place"}
{"text":"This place is great for a family and kids love it! Or of your going to grab appetizers & drinks with some friends! I'd def recommend the pizza - it is very good! But everything else I'd compare to normal bar food - the pesto chicken sandwich was my fav - but didn't have much taste the last time I was here. I will say their liquor drinks are very strong and they don't play around :) 

If you have kids - it is a great place as there are huge tv screens with cartoons - plus the atmosphere keeps them entertained! And there is the perfect kids menu! Chicken fingers, mini corn dogs, and pizza are my niece and nephews favorites!"}
{"text":"This is really a 3.5 (stupid yelp.  Give me shades of grey!)  

I like the setup.  Stadium kind of with large tvs.  I will give them credit for a vast beer selection.  Of course they are out of the one I want, but a lot to choose from.  

I had the BBQ Chicken pizza.  I add jalapenos.  I am not sure where they get their jalos from, but they must be fed with the piss of the devil (not in your groceries freezer section).  These jalos where 5X hotter than normal jalos. 

I will be back to make sure its not a fluke.

Ok prices on the food also.  Devil piss pizza (patent it, please report any use or abuse of my patent to devil piss pizza inc. formerly Mephostopheles Micturition Meat packing)  That is a long way for a devil alliteration joke."}
{"text":"The place has FAST service, the food is a two ( meaning the meat might taste strong or old) I accidentally spilled my glass of wine, told the waitress; she said oh that's too bad. I asked her if maybe I could get it replaced.... with management approval she did bring me a new one...so no complaining on service but food is definitely mediocre..."}
{"text":"Food is always a little better than average. I have to say asking someone for their credit card for a deposit when you order a Moscow Mule drink when you are with your family is VERY tacky! I can see when there is crowd but when you are with your three kids and wife? Don't assume everyone is a thief and covets a stupid copper mug. Especially when they are dropping a c-note on dinners. I'll bet the owner is so cheap he squeaks when he walks. Dolt!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed dinner here and maybe if got a little higher review than if should of because I expected less. We went here with my inlaws and husband for my mother in laws bday. The drinks are average, my husband thought the beer selection was pretty good, better than most bars. 

The service was somewhat slow, we sat in the bar section so I think the bar tenders were also waiting on us but really not too bad considering. 

The food is what I was expected less and got more about. I got the boneyard dip, which was a French dip sandwich and it was wonderful. The meat the tender and there was caramelized onions on top. Terrific. On the side there was au jus that I thought was better than most I have tried. I am a big salt person but my husband thought it was a little salty. I thought had great deep flavor and with the sandwich it may have been one if my favorite French dip sandwiches ever. I got the Cajun fries with it and I am so happy I did. They had great spice and crunch and I could just get those as app. Terrific. My husband got half a rack of the 'bones' which were ribs. And they were so tender it was almost too much. They were def fall off the bone, and the BBQ sauce wasn't great but it wasn't terrible. My husband would even order then again, which says a lot because he is not as lenient as I am :-) the cole slaw he got with with it was way over dressed and the beans were average. The regular fries were pretty good too. 

All in all this is a fun bar to come to, with set above average food but I wouldn't be expecting a gourmet meal here. I will be excited to try to try different things on this menu."}
{"text":"Im rating this strictly on yesterdays trip to Boneryard.  I have been to this location, the Mayfield location also.  Back in the day we used to hit up the Boneryard downtown all the time.  2.00 drafts for happy hour?  Hell yeah..  They discount ALL the drafts, not like Prosperity, Tap House, South Side, etc. that only discount some beers.  Seems like I always want the one beer that is NOT on special.  Hey, I work for a livin so happy hour prices make my black ass smile!  This particular trip they had happy hr till 9pm AND .49 boneless wangs!  Server was super cute and super fast, despite being run all over by the Buffy and Thad types of early 30, professional types with 2.2 young kids that live in the area.  Food was pretty good, for a chain restaurant.  With the deals they run, it is worth it for an OK dinner and several good beers!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times since 2003.  I find the food a decent value, beer selection is excellent (with good happy hour prices), and the service is usually at least decent, often better.  Some staff recognize my family, which probably helps.  I did notice they added something on the menu about moving people along after eating.  That rubs me the wrong way, but maybe it's to chase off people sitting 5 hours with chips and Coke refills or something."}
{"text":"If I could give zero I would. This place was so bad I actually downloaded the Yelp app just to complain about how terrible our wings were. If you like undercooked chicken wings, eat here. Their representation of spicy to non spicy wings is so inaccurate. You will be very disappointed if you want spicy wings. Beer was flat. Boo hoo to this place. #blowyard"}
{"text":"I went to the Boneyard Grill in Broadview Heights this past weekend on Saturday around 7:30pm. There was an approximate 1/2 hr wait due to a party of 100 being served so the kitchen was \"back logged\". I can't say if there is typically that kind of wait on an average weekend customer flow. The hostess was nice and we took a seat at the bar. We quickly spotted a high top that opened up at the bar and settled in for our dinner/drinks. The server greeted us quickly and was very quick to help us. Very friendly as well. We ordered beers and placed our food order. The server returned and told us that she could put our appetizers in but the food order had to wait until the kitchen caught up with this 100 person party. She implied it was a \"bad planning\" issue on someone's behalf at Boneyard. 

Food: We had the appetizers of breaded shrimp, which was a \"new\" menu item. They made it sound fancy, but when it arrived, the runner called it \"popcorn\" shrimp. They were plentiful but your basic greasy popcorn shrimp in a battered dough, not breaded. We also ordered the Siam Chicken Skewers over Thai peanut noodles. Average at best. Chicken was a little dry and the noodles had some nice flavor but were drowning in a running mayo type dressing. They were stingy on the tahini. Our main courses, mine grilled steak over \"mixed greens\", let's just say ICEBERG...call a spade a spade was OK. It would have been much better if they actually used good quality greens. This isn't the 80's anymore. Mixed greens are readily available. My salad also came with a bread stick..similar to the ones you would have at Olive Garden except mine was more like sponge. Just poor quality. Again, this isn't the 80's a decent bread isn't hard to find. My husband ordered the pulled pork and ate everything on his dish BUT the pulled pork. The pork was so \"pulled\" that is was a glob of a mess. 

As we waited a LONG time for our dinner orders, we watched the band of the evening set up, HOOKED ON TONICS. They were so great that we decided to skip our \"movie night\" and stay and listen to the band. They helped recover the experience a bit. 

IF we return to the Boneyard (due to close proximity to our home), I would probably stick with a burger and beer. If you screw up a burger, you shouldn't be making food!"}
{"text":"I still remain a decently satisfied customer of the Bone Yard in Broadview Heights. I went last night and my friends and I received great service.  For the first time, I tried their pizza - the dish was a little small (I finished it completely, rare for me) but the pizza itself was delicious!  The sangria was good enough that I ordered two of them, and was a perfect accompaniment to a summer evening on a patio with twinkle lights."}
{"text":"Based on some reviews, I can't believe I went to the same restaurant.   This place is terrible.  LOUD music - you need to scream your order.  Really subpar food.  I mean really below average. I noticed some dusty and, cobwebbed decorations - yuck.  Service was average."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. I really like the set up. Staff is awesome. It's my first time here. My margarita was good. Also they play good music."}
{"text":"Good food great atmosphere and excellent service. Our waitress Mickey was so sweet! Glad we made the stop along our journey."}
{"text":"This place is what it is. A very loud sports bar with average food and an average beer selection. I'd say it's a step above Applebees right in line with Winking Lizard or Paninis. Since I'm sure all of you know that already, I'll keep this short and sweet.

My boyfriend and I stopped in here after work the other night and had no idea there was an Ohio State game on. Which makes this a terrible place to have dinner conversation. Obviously not the restaurants fault and we were too lazy to go anywhere else but just keep in mind how sporty of a bar this is when making the decision to eat here. Fans cheering every 5 minutes makes for a very noisy evening.

Despite the place being jam packed with football fans, our waitress was very attentive. She handled the crowd well and we were in and out of here quicker than we imagined we would be.

Food was \"meh\". The chips with the salsa were very stale and my water had stuff floating in it. Trevor said his pizza was ok even though it was supposed to be the double pepperoni. I don't know about you, but 2-3 pepperonis per piece is not double pepperoni. My buffalo mac and cheese was pretty tasty. HUGE portion though, box that stuff up. Great for lunch the next day. 

Overall Boneyard is good for what it is. However, if you're looking for a quiet night with unique food, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"I used to live next door to the  bone yard for 3 years.  Their wings and the bone yard burger are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Far be it from me to be critical of another Yelper (oh, no, watch me), but Angry B hates Lolita and loves The Boneyard? Good grief, do WE occupy different zones of the food planet. 

I live minutes from here, tried it six times and decided it would be better eating crackers than spending one more penny at this place. 

Look, if you're under 30, like to drink, don't care that much about the quality of food or service, you'll think it's just deeee-liteful.  If, however, you don't fit into that category, please don't waste your time and money. It's slop."}
{"text":"Boneyard is not very good. The ribs are underdone, the wings are so-so and the burgers are food-grade frozen patties from some distributor. There's nothing here that indicates that they care at all about differentiating their place from anywhere else except the giant wall of TVs which would be cool during March Madness (maybe) and the fake skeletons hanging here and there. I get invited to this place maybe once a year and I say, 'why not?' and it's never as good as Winking Lizard which isn't great either. At least the Lizard has eight thousand beers to choose from. The Lizard is always more crowded though. 

Boneyard will not impress you."}
{"text":"I have never had a decent meal from this place. I live close by so I have tried multiple times to give them a chance. Either the food is cold, which has happened often or tasteless. 
I will say that the atmosphere is nice for a family but I wont be returning."}
{"text":"Although the patio was nice, the service was okay and the nachos were gross. We will give it another try just because."}
{"text":"Large beer selection, huge TVs and sometimes live bands.  They are good for kids, and have an extensive menu with sandwiches and burgers."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is good,  but the place is overpriced for what you get. The food is average on a good day and below average on a bad day. The only food I've had that I enjoyed are the loaded nachos. They do actually have some good nachos so when I want some I go there. It's the kind of place that I never suggest going to but if some friends want to meet there I'll concede. I don't hate the place but I don't like it either. They need to make better food or lower their prices to the standard of what they serve. They have good selection of beers on tap,  but only 16oz glasses. I  Iike my tall ones from time to time and can't get them here."}
{"text":"The main dining area has partial stadium style seating, with booths and tables and large screen TVs.  In that sense it reminds me of Damon's.

Prices were average.  It was boneless wing night - 50 cent boneless wings (have to buy in groups of 10).  The taste and quality of meat was OK, but they were tiny, just about bite size.  $5 for 10 chicken nuggets isn't too bad, but if I had paid the normal menu price of $10 I would have been upset.

Sauteed veggies as my side dish - generous serving, nicely prepared.

Kids' liked their meals, although both of them were still hungry after.

My wife ordered the Cobb salad and was very happy.  It was large and featured a lot of extras, like eggs, and guacamole.  Probably the best thing we ordered.

The place is kid friendly, which I was concerned about before entering.  Only some very fake looking skeletons here and there."}
{"text":"Great for a beer and the normal bar food. Decor is pretty cool, if you are into the undead. (Desperation?). No need to make a special trip though."}
{"text":"In suburbia there really isn't much else you can ask for when it comes to a large bar with decent \"american\" food.  I have eaten here many times as well as gotten takeout and overall it's pretty good food.  Sometimes it can get too loud and you have to resort to shouting across your table, but it is a sports bar so you can't complain too much.  There are huge projector screens showing all the games going on, and a pretty large bar with pool tables.  Try it out, because honestly there is slim pickings around here when it comes to bars so it's either here or B-dubs."}
{"text":"We were kicked out for having a baby that was sleeping in car seat. They said it was 21 and up. Last time we ever go there...."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've been here, and I remember the food was good, but this last time was great. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it had good flavor and good portions. My girlfriend wanted me to bring home the Boneyard Pasta, so I looked at the price and said for almost $15 from here will be a rip off! Boy was I wrong! They packed that container of one of the best pasta dishes I've had, and I've been to many authentic Italian restaurants.  Got it home which was 45 minutes away, it was still warm and my girlfriend loved it. There was enough for lunch for both of us the next day and for lunch for me the next. This pasta dish was so good with the price, portion and the flavor was amazing along with the shredded chicken and amazing sauce."}
{"text":"When I read that this restaurant had a 'whimsical' atmosphere, I had to try it. I like whimsy as much as you do. If we went there together we might laugh and sing and dance and be merry and whimsical together. We would have such fun that when retelling our exploits we'd again fall into laughing and merriment and oh wouldn't it be a laugh? Such fun!

Well, dear me, I saw fake corpses attached to the walls throughout this bar and I did not feel merry. I escaped to the rest room and micturated with a deepening sorrow for those lost souls dangling above the peanut bin in the waiting room. Such things grind on me because I might die some day and if some Boneyard hard-on hung my soulless self in a sports bar in Broadview Heights it might make me not want to sing and dance. It set my teeth on edge.

I ordered a Bloody Mary doubled up on the vodka and waited for it to hit me in the face like a cudgel from hell and it did. They don't skimp on the hooch in this rat hole. These Broadview Heights bastards charge an arm and a leg though. So what? You can worry about the Visa bill next month. I ordered another rot-gut drink; hold the ice, and some ribs. What the hell, bring a dozen hot wings too. Extra hot sauce. I watched those dicks from Miami play basketball on one of a dozen massive TV screens and I cursed a young child whose crayon rolled under my booth. He cried. I spat a gob of tomato vodka spittle at him. He fled. A truce of sorts.

The ribs tasted a little rawish which works well with the death/boneyard motif. Okay, I get it, blood on the bone in the boneyard. No complaints. The wings fought back a little but they went down okay. I dug the pinkish meat out between the black bones and admired the pile of mess I had made on the table next to the empty refuse bowl. I pocketed the wipes and extra napkins and wiped my filthy hands on the fake leather bench. In my virulent state I tipped well anyway since I could leave and they couldn't.

On my way out, I noticed a whimsical sign near the door and my spirit broke. The door opened out toward North Royalton and it was like the sun was shining and each cloud was a happy dollop of whipped cream dancing across the sky like a fun sundae of funny shapes of delight.

I laughed and laughed!"}
