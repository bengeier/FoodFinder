{"text":"Not delicious like we expect at Bojangles. Dry biscuits, no seasoning, not hot or even warm."}
{"text":"This is the worst bojangles ever they take forver at the drive thru. Never have any chicken ready and ever biscuit I have gotten has been hard as a rock!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken is too greasy and it doesn't taste good. Their biscuits are also very dry. I didn't enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight at 8pm and they were out of chicken breasts and rice (even though they are open until 10pm). We ordered and when we pulled up to the drive through window we couldn't believe how dirty the kitchen was. Garbage and fries all over the floor, countertops were dirty and the trash was overflowing. We will not be back."}
{"text":"On Wednesday, 12/12 we were in NC visiting for a wedding, and on our last night really wanted to try some Bojangles. We looked up the time this bojangles closed, and realized it closed at 11 pm. At the time it was 1040, so we made a trip to bojangles that was 5 min away. We were there at 1045. No one answered the drive through. We pulled up to the window and knocked at the window. This lady came out of the back 2 min later, looked at us through the window and waved her fingers at us. They were not to close for another 15 minutes. I understand we got there late, but if you say you close at 11, then you need to be prepared to serve customers until 10:59. Very poor, and rude service."}
{"text":"I love Bojangles and this particular location is one of my favorites. It's normally very clean and service is attentive which means it is well managed. Their homemade biscuits are, in my opinion, of the best."}
{"text":"This unit can not get their act together. The sad thing is that corporate doesn't care !!!   They have finally got this unit back to being great again   I went in this morning 6/24/18. Guess what ? They have a B grade sanitation rating.  2 times in the last several years"}
{"text":"Went up to the speaker to order, and couldn't understand the lady. So I asked for her to repeat herself.. she then proceeded to tell me that something was wrong with my hearing when I got to the window. And after that she gave me an attitude and when I opened the box, my chicken was cold and looked like it had been sitting out for 3 days. DO NOT GO TO THIS BOJANGLES. They hire rude people who don't have a life."}
{"text":"Drive thru was quick tonight. Thankfully, the food was hot considering it was off-peak time. Fast service, hot and good chicken...you know what to expect."}
{"text":"Store 869, worst Bojangles I have ever been to in my entire life and I live in the town where the corporate headquarters is located.  When we arrived at the location there was a long line of cars in the Drive-Thru but I decided to drive through and I was hoping for the best for quick service but it took me about 15 minutes to get up place my order and pick it up from the case you're at the window. I asked her why they were so slow tonight and she said they were so busy outside and packed on the inside but when I drove up past the Windows after I picked up my order there was only one person in the entire store inside so she was just lying to me to give me an excuse.  I also asked her to put salt in the bag in my order and when I got home of course there was no salt in there.  You would think the managers at this store would have better sense to staff the store properly at dinner time but I can assure you as much as I like their chicken tenders I will never go back to this one Bojangles. Whatever you do be sure and avoid the Bojangles on Old Monroe Road in front of the Harris Teeter out in Stallings Indian Trail area it will not be worth your time to try and go there.  Be advised owners and corporate could careless about your opinion of this location."}
{"text":"I love bojangles. There is something about their chicken that I like more than chicfila. With that being said, it was my first time at his location. Went about 7:00, they close at 10.  I ordered a 4 piece homestyle tender box with Mac n cheese as my side. They lady at the window said they were out of mac n cheese so instead, I got coleslaw.  I got home and noticed that the coleslaw was ina really small container. I wasn't sure if that's regular or not, because I usually get the fries. When I opened the slaw and started to eat it, i realized it was frozen, lol. I could not eat it so I set it aside while I ate my tenders and biscuit. It still didn't thaw so I just threw it away. I wish I would have gotten fries because I feel like you get more, and maybe they wouldn't have been frozen."}
