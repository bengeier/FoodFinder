{"text":"The BEST place for soon tofu! The flavour just can't get any better.   Services are always speedy and pleasant. One of the waitresses is very friendly and sweet.   I went there 4 times in a month and will definitely frequent!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved it. Went for late lunch today, and end up at the restaurant that was almost empty. The service was brilliant. The lady serving us was very nice and helpful. She explained everything and was very considerate.  They have decent vegetarian options and the Soon Tofu (soup) was absolutely brilliant. We order BibimBap and it was also as good as it gets. The veggies and the rice were fresh and the hot sauce was as hot and as sour as it can get.   I missed having fried dumplings, because they didn't have any vegetarian ones. But nonetheless it was a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"Thanks to Lauren M's great review and recommendation, I was able to try out a new Soon Tofu restaurant! My family really loves Soft Tofu so this was a great food experience for us all.  I usually order Kimchi flavoured foods whenever at a Korean Restaurant so I didn't hesitate at all in ordering the Kimchi Soon Tofu. I was very please with Tofu Village's version as the broth contained the right amount of spiciness and it tasted delicious. It went well together with their purple stone pot steamed rice which was visually appetizing as it was yummy. The purple rice that's stuck at the bottom of the stone pot is very good (the waiter/waitress pour water into the stone pot to soften up the rice). It's good after eating a spicy bowl of Soon Tofu as it's refreshing.  As for banchans, They bring them out as soon as you sit down and they are all very delicious - kimchi, pickled cucumbers, pickled radishes, potatoes etc. They are also very nice about bringing you some more if you ask (the kimchi was sooo good, i had to ask for refills 3 times!).  The price is also amazing as it's less than 8 dollars! For all the food they give you, its definitely a bargain! As far as the food goes, it's a must try in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I ended up here on my way to Buk Chang, but decided to try here instead. It was delicious. I had the vegetarian. It was soooo much food, but I couldn't stop because I was enjoying it so much. The staff were lovely and very attentive. It was a Tuesday night and it was pretty empty. I would definitely recommend it and will bring friends with me next time."}
{"text":"My friend and I found this restaurant accidentally, and it now has topped on my Korean restaurant list. The food is served fast and is of large portion size. And most of all, the tofu's delicious. My recommendation is seafood tofu soup. You can taste flavour of seafood from the soup!"}
{"text":"Likes: - soon do bu - soon do bu - soon do bu - seafood pancake and spicy pork bulgogi are very good as well.   Dislikes: - service a little slow but for the price what do you expect - side dishes are a hit and miss  Bottom line: The best soon do bu in town!   If you are looking for some really hot and spicy Korean tofu stew I would skip the lines at Buk chang dong and head here. The taste is as good and in my opinion maybe better than the place next door and you don't have to deal with the crowd. Unlike most restaurants that serve a watered down version the soup here definitely has character. There's lots of flavor in the broth and it's always served with the right amount of tofu."}
{"text":"Its a good place with tasty food items at a very affordable price. Went there for food just before closing and they were very courteous in seating me and didn't rush me to finish. I appreciate that. Didn't know how to make sure the egg was cooked, but that is my inexperience speaking. Overall, good time."}
{"text":"Was craving jap chae so I went here. Awesome service, fast and the lady was nice. And needless to say the craving was satisfied."}
{"text":"As one of my favourite go-tos in Koreatown, Tofu Village is uncharacteristically clean and spacious. (even the bathrooms!)  I've only ever ordered their namesake, tofu soup, which comes boiling hot with a raw egg, and a stone-bowl of rice. Yum!  The spice factor can actually be customized however you like, although the menu lists mild, medium and hot only. If you say \"really, really mild, like the mildest ever,\" your soup will be white...it might be a little bland, but that's what you asked for!  The servings are plentiful, and the side dishes are unlimited, as per the norm in Korean restaurants. My favourite part is the multigrain rice. It's sweet, soft, and good for you.  I know this makes me a huge human rights violating evil person, but some of the servers don't speak Korean, which I find a little jarring. My preferred language is English, but I'm conditioned to order food in Korean in Korean restaurants. On the positive side, everyone speaks English, so never fear, anglophones!  If you order takeout, they just give you regular white rice without the crispy stone bowl part, so that's kind of a loss. But, a whole meal for under $8? What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Since this place is called Tofu house, I will have to judge this review on their Tofu!  Had a craving for Soon Tofu so headed my way to Buk Chang Dong only to be met by an impenetrable line of 10 other hungry folks. I had always wondered about Tofu Village which is only a few hops away so decided to try it for the first time.  About the Tofu. The tofu was fresh, however the broth was a bit bland. I ordered the exact same dish as BukchangDong.... The rice was cooked in stone pot, albeit without the date. The meat looked like mystery ground pork. The banchan was ok: kimchi, potatoes, however the bean sprouts tasted and looked stale.  If I was in a small town other than Toronto I would be more than happy with this place, however being situated right next to BukChangDong, I will have to defer unless there are lineups like today.  Food: 3 Service: 4 Ambience: 4 Overall: 3 of 5 stars"}
{"text":"I will definitely be back. I had the Gamjatang (pork bone soup) for the first time and I thought the dish was fantastic. I've never eaten this dish before, and it was a little hard to get at the actual meat in the meal, it did taste excellent--I recommend going here with a good friend, like I did, rather than a date because you are going to get this all over yourself and appearing quite the slob. Not that I cared because it just tasted so good. Great side dishes too.   The service was a little ehnnn, but it didn't matter because the food came out quickly and prepared well. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Would go back again.  Food was good (seafood and tofu pancake was the favourite among the group), servers were attentive, and very decent price (around $48 plus tip for two appetizers and three entrees)."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a referred to by a friend and it was amazing. The restaurant setting is very nice and the staff is friendly. This place has the best korean bbq! Their kalbi is nice and juicy and filled with flavor. Their tofu, which is served as side dishes is amazing and addictive as well. I am always ordering lots while I'm there. I have tried many different kalbi dishes and this one is by far the best!"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe the heaven that has been in my mouth everytime I come here.  Over 6 years I have been coming here to taste the smooth spicy soup base, combined with the savory bean sprouts. Washed down with a shot of sweet and bitter soju.   So many memories, never once has the taste wavered. You need to go. Now."}
{"text":"I had the house special soon dubu with medium spiciness, it was milder than I expected but still very good. The house special is basically saefood with a bit of beef.  The soup was flavourful and had a hint of the sweetness you get from seafood, a great meal for a cold day!  it was pretty quiet when I went there so maybe because of that the srrvice was a little slow...its only a very minor complaint though, overall the service was pleasant and polite."}
{"text":"Been here so many times it's become a revolving staple of restaurants I go to when I don't know what I feel like or something to warm up to on a cold Canadian winter day.  To me Soon do bu is the quintessential comfort food.  It checks off all the requirements, it's a soup, it's hot (and spicy), easy to eat (it's a soup), and relatively healthy because it's mostly tofu although your doctor may not agree so much with the amount of sodium but that's why it's comfort food, not rabbit food.  I always get the seafood mild because anything spicier I don't even taste the soup anymore.  The rice is always something I look forward to in the stone bowl.  The stone bowl keeps the rice hot/warm throughout the whole meal, nice.  The kimchi before the meal is always a nice touch.  Consistent, delicious every time.    The restaurant is also bigger than its immediate Soon do bu neighbour which is also very good but so cramped there I feel like I'm eating in a sardine can.  Here I can sit down, stretch a bit and not have to listen to 4 conversations at the same time.  They opened up another location along Bloor but I stick to this one because they serve rice in stone bowls which to me is the whole point of Soon do bu and isn't the same any other way.    The other thing too about comfort food to me is that it's comfortable on my wallet afterwards which this is :)"}
{"text":"My friend took me here once, and I've been back several times with my gf, family and other friends. Everyone I've been here with loved the place.  The soon tofu combo is perfect for a cold chilly night. The soup is hot and the tofu is so smooth and silky. I usually get the one with the seafood, which is so extremely satisfying. The soup comes with Korean side dishes (I really like the kimchi here) and a big bowl of rice. Sometimes I get the combo with comes with a soup, rice and a main dish (usually I get the spicy pork belly). It is also delicious.  I have gotten bibimbap here and it was ok. Maybe it's because I don't really like bibimbap, but if I were here I'd go for the soup every time."}
{"text":"Best Soon do bu in the city!!!  I feel comfortable to visit this restaurant even when I'm alone. The menu is very clear and easy to understand, and all the waiters/waitresses are super kind. My favourite is Vegetable Soon do bu. It's hot, spicy, health and delicious. You can choose the degree of the spiciness, spicy, medium and mild. It's served with rice in hot stone pot by side. Not only what you order, several dishes of namul and kimchi are served.  Hot stone bibimbap is also good.  This is the Korean restaurant that I keep coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I had a Seafood & tofu soup. It came with purple rice in a stone pot & tasty side dishes. The soya been side dish was yummy. When I finished it, the superb waiter brought me another bowl! All of this for $10.00 including tax! Spice level can be adjusted when you order. My host had been in before. She was a bit uncomfortable with the whole shrimps. I understand this, however the shells & shrimp heads add to the flavour. Many people eat the heads. I use chopsticks to bite the tail off. Leaving the head. The shell on the tail is actually tasty & crunchy :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food (unlimited banchan!), fast service (we hardly had to wait for our food at all), and huge portions (oh my god, so much food)--definitely a winner!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Koreatown looking for a new restaurant to try. House of Soon seemed to have good reviews and a variety of menu options. The soon tofu was thick and silky. It's comparable to Buk Chang Dong just a few storefronts away. House of Soon has plenty of tofu flavours, but if tofu is not what you desire, there are many other options. I also tried the pork bone soup, 3 large pieces with plenty of meat. The meat was soft and not too fatty. Great with some purple rice and tofu.  Service wasn't great though. The staff are polite courteous but slow and a bit disorganized. We asked for refills for tea, only 2/3 were filled. I ask for water for the three of us, I only got one glass of water. Each of our orders were brought, a few minutes apart, so one person was trying to be polite and wait until everyone's food came. After 10 minutes, I insisted he eat. He and my other friend each ordered combo meals which included a soon tofu, and this arrived halfway through their meal. This seemed to be the pattern with the table next to us.  It was a Friday evening, the restaurant was busy, but not packed.  So I didn't really think that could be an excuse either.  Food was authentic and flavourful, but service needs some work."}
{"text":"Love love Tofu village, I don't have to drink a gallon of water after the meal like the next door (no offense to their fans) clean, great service, awesome food, can't ask more than that! We've been eating there for about 3 years, drive all the way from North York, the best Soon tofu stew in the town minus MSG! Don't forget to try the tofu seafood pancake!"}
{"text":"The Pork bone soup is delicious! The broth looks clear and doesn't taste as oily or salty as the ones I've had before. The meat has a distinct sweet flavour to it. Also, there is more meat on the bone. The portion size is very good. It is the best pork bone soup I've ever had in Toronto.  The soon Tofu is better than the one next door (I am not sure how to spell it...Duk boong..something). I tried both places and I feel that the broth tastes sweeter and fuller at Toful Village. The kimchi tastes pretty fresh. The only thing I don't like is the burnt smell in the soup. I also see a bit of black bits in the soup. I think the meat/seafood in the soup was overcooked.   Service is average, I saw the server scooping out the rice and pouring tea in the stone bowl for another table, but didn't offer the same service to me. The wait time is a bit long.   Overall, a solid 4/5 for the whole experience. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for t he first time today, and wow! I think I have a new favourite Korean restaurant. I've been hooked on Ka Chi for a while, but this is better.   I think this may have been the best Bibimbap I've ever had! The veggies were perfect, and included two different kinds of dark mushrooms, although it's possible one was some kind of sea vegetable - really not sure, but whatever it was, it was tasty.   If you want it vegetarian, you have to ask for that - it's not on the menu as a separate option, but they don't bat an eye at the request, and it comes with a nice helping of crumbly super-dense tofu seasoned with sesame seeds and sesame oil, not just the mushy plain tofu most other places will give you, plus a perfect fried egg (though I'm sure they will happily leave out the egg if you ask them to).   Plus, there were several of the little side dishes most Korean restaurants like to give you, including potatoes in a wonderful sweet sauce, and some uncommonly good kimchi - much more flavourful than most, though slightly less spicy. Maybe they toned down the heat a touch to let the other flavours shine through more? It still had a satisfying kick, but it tasted like a lot more than just the usual hot and sour.   The service was prompt and friendly, the prices were quite reasonable, and there were a ton of other things on the menu that looked really good. Plus, how can you not like a restaurant whose name is bookended by \"tofu\" at both ends? The symmetry is part of its charm. :-) I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Such good food, and cheap! I love the rice they serve, the soon tofu is so good, and service is fairly decent. My go-to Korean restaurant, and it's where I take people to introduce them to soon tofu."}
{"text":"Have been to Tofu Village twice in the last year and both times the service was fantastic! The server was smiling, friendly and happy to help give us information on which menu items were vegetarian friendly. She came back multiple times to check on us and refilled the side dishes every time. After the meal, she asked us how it was and if we were happy with the portions.  I haven't had Korean food at many other places but the Bibimbap here is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I love Korea Town, cheap eats, opened late, and just good comfort food. Only problem with some of the Korean joints in the area is the heavy use of MSG which I find is a short cut to good tasty food. Not Tofu Village, they don't use any MSG in their soup which makes for a good clean meal.   I have tried a good variety of items here, Soon Tofu, Kam Ja Tong, Chap Jae, Mandu,  Dobuki, Bulgogi, Bibimbab, etc. and all are equally stellar in quality and tastiness.   The price point is good being equal or slightly cheaper than other restaurants on the street. I also notice a very key difference here, service, which I find spectacular and the owner and his wife are always on site to make sure every patron is fed well and happy.  Pet Peeve: If you can't handle spicy food don't order anything spicy and later complain that you can't eat it and that the mild you wanted feels like a medium to you. Just stick to plain or the other non-spicy options on the menu because I don't want to sit through a meal with you complaining to the server and your friends the whole time how you can't handle spicy foods. Smarten up and don't be a baby...Yes this happened to me tonight where a guy eating with 3 girls was being such a baby."}
{"text":"I have to say that after having Buk Chang http://www.yelp.ca/biz/buk-chang-dong-soon-tofu-toronto-2#hrid:-6aabdWFC578uyB-DaEe-A a handful of times recently, and visiting Owl of Minerva http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-owl-of-minerva-markham#hrid:dkpR7cFBfI5b-vTk85kMEA , HoSu http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ho-su-bistro-toronto-2#hrid:5aGYarz_0wDRn5CjXlZUmg and First Markham's Sogong http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sogong-dong-tofu-house-markham#hrid:3LUMtZVV9GgpWgI2cMd16w for soon tofu since I wrote my last review, I think its time for an update.   House of Soon is by FAR the best. I eat the vegetable soon tofu which comes bubbling hot, with an egg and purple rice in clay pot. It comes super Spicy if you want it, you get 5 side dishes including killer kimchi and those delicious potatos.   Two of the above restaurants served white rice instead which was lacking. Owl of Minerva didn't give me an egg.   The food here is top quality and the service is incredible. This last Friday we visited with some Korean food newbies. The server was asking them questions and explaining everything without any attitude whatsoever. They are respectful, and your side dishes are constantly replenished along with your tea. You get zero intimidation here. If you don't understand what something is, or if you will like it, they do not give you \"really?-then-why-are-you-here-huh-fried-rice-and-chicken-balls\"  We tried the seafood pancakes on the last visit which were fantastic. They OWNED ka-Chis. Must try.   I am with Lauren M. This is my FAVORITE Korea town resto as well., and perhaps one of my favorite Toronto restaurants as well. AMAZING."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat Korean. The staff is always super friendly and the food yummy. I find their pancakes are a hit or miss depending on the day, sometimes I've gotten delicious pancakes and others a little greasy. Otherwise, their side dishes are of great variety and their soon tofu is delicious.  I will say I prefer the seafood soon tofu from Buk Chang Song Soon but I tend to keep coming back to this place. It's more comfortable to me. Good for small groups though I'd say more five+ can be uncomfortable during busy times.  Can get busy in the evenings and you may have to wait a little bit but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Order the Kali Ribs and Tofu soup combo! Delicious, a tad on the smaller size for the tofu soup but delicious and service was very attentive! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Just had the Seafood tofu! Was great! Highly recommended.  Very inexpensive!"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place last week on a dreary, rainy day which is actually the perfect weather for soon-tofu soup (aka, soon-dubu). I used to go to Buk-Chan-dong a few doors west until I noticed that I would always get sick shortly after my meal. The service at BCD was good but during the rush, I often found the combination of the noise, heat, and cramped conditions to be too much.   I then frequented Myung-dong Soon-dubu (also on Bloor, closer to Bathurst, north side; the one that also serves maki) when I needed my fix, where I found the service was sincere (this is truly a mom-and-pop operation), kimchi is just like mom's (well, almost), AND they give way more banchan (side dishes) than at BCD. It's also a better place to enjoy scalding-hot soup. But alas, this review is about Tofu Village, so on we go...  I really enjoyed the food at Tofu Village. Not only is the place clean, and the level of service just right, but DAMMIT the food is SO good!! We ordered two combos: dweji kalbi (shredded spicy pork on sizzling platter) + house soon-dubu, and dolsot bibimbap + house soon-dubu (both were $14 without tax). The only negative, and I may be being greedy here, but I wish the fried egg in the bibimbap was bigger as the yolk is what makes the dish that much tastier.   I normally order pork or seafood soon-dubu, depending on whether I feel like dealing with the ordeal of peeling the shrimp with my teeth or not, but this house version of the soup was perfect in that it contained just the right amount of everything. Usually other restos serve combos or set meals with basic items (ie, garden salad vs caesar) where one has to pay extra to upgrade but the house soup is actually the *supreme* version and contains pork, beef, vegs, seafood.  Everything we ate was perfectly fresh, spiced just right, and the portion sizes were generous as well. These combos are a bit big for one person but even still, other places that offer combos tend to give JUST enough. Also important is that the banchan here is amazing! Among them were the usual kimchi (btw: good kimchi is the tell-tale sign that the other dishes will not disappoint), potatoes in sweet syrup, assortment of seasoned vegs and *wow* their tofu side dish (also found in the bibimbap) is addictive: thin slices of firm tofu and broccoli floret (no S) lightly seasoned with sesame oil. This dish alone will easily turn any tofu-haters into lovers.   I will definitely be going back the next time I get a hankering for some good-ol' soon-dubu which this current weather will soon steer me to."}
{"text":"So cheap and delicious. Food comes very fast. They have a large turnover rate. I love this place."}
{"text":"We ordered the house soon tofu and the dumpling soon tofu and they were both very good! They were filled with soft, relatively large chunks of tofu, and the broth was very flavourful! The house soon tofu came with a shrimp, a few clams, and beef. The dumplings were I think pork and cabbage, and it was good! The hot broths came with an egg that you crack into the stew while it's still bubbling. They had a really decent side dish spread (Kimchi, pickled radish and cabbage, tofu, bean sprouts...etc), and they came by to offer more when we finished them. The service was attentive -- they came constantly to refill the tea, and were very patient with questions. Overall, a big thumbs up to them!"}
{"text":"i quite enjoy tofu village compared to the other Korean restaurants in bloor west village. i'm usually not a HUGE fan of tofu but i can't get enough of their house-made tofu! it's fantastic.   the sets that come with protein + soup + rice are great value and you will probably have leftovers to take home with you as well =)"}
{"text":"From my vegetarian culinary adventures:  Been on a Korean kick lately. Read reviews about best Korean in the area and settled on Tofu Village. I've been to Buk Chang Dong and Chadang Soon Tofu and both are good. But was craving more variety from the menu so decided to come here.   Banchan was pretty good except the bean sprouts. Then realized they gave me the 'non-Korean-person' version and asked for what the table of Koreans sitting next to me were eating. Theirs was even more delicious!! Loved the spicy jalapeño peppers. Kimchi was also yummy.   Ordered the soon tofu and veggie bibimbap combo. Too much food for me. Soup was good by, wow!, the bibimbap was outstanding. Mostly because of the gochujang. By far the most delicious and flavourful version of this sauce I've ever had.   Can't wait to go back and have it again!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for pork bone! The soup broth was so delicious and flavourfull, you can tell that they did not water down the soup. It tasted like it was slow cooked for hours and and the meat was how it should be fall off the bone. I've had horrible pork bone soup from other places where the broth was bland and had no taste and the pork was hard and barely any meat. When I go with my boyfriend we usually order the tofu soup or the pork bone soup and sometimes if we're really hungry we get the galbi short ribs or the spicy pork bulgogi.   The waitresses are always very polite and friendly and the owner is always there when I go eat. If our table was too small for the amount of food we had he would push another table together for us so that we had more room. I came here in the first few months that they opened and now it's just so busy."}
{"text":"Flavorful, and delicious tofu soup. I love their stone bowl steamed rice. It comes with tofu soup on the side:)  They offer a tasty banchan and will refill my favorites when I ask nicely.  Take a chance and try the kalbi which is korean bbq short ribs! Good quality and flavor.  The quality of the soup, the amount of banchan, and the tofu soup keep me coming back."}
{"text":"The tofu stew is creamy and full of flavor. The seafood pancakes are perfect. The prices are low, which is no surprise for the neighborhood but great value considering the quality of the food. The decor is more clean and modern than I expected. The service can veer from attentive to indifferent depending on the server but  that's pretty standard in Koreatown and there's no point getting worked up about it."}
{"text":"The best Korean food in Toronto, hands down. The staff is lovely and accommodating. Bathroom in the basement. We had the Korean dish with tofu soup - so delicious."}
{"text":"Ive been here countless times. They never disappoint. I always order their tofu stew and pork bone soup. Great price and customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered kimchi tofu soup. The service was fast and the portion was generous. The soup base wasn't the best but for the price it was ok ($10 including taxes). The side dishes were not that tasty for a korean customer myself! I would go back when i'm really craving for a spicy kimchi tofu soup!!"}
{"text":"I was wandering around Bloor St with a craving for Korean. I noticed a big sign, written in a big cartoonish font \"Tofu Village\".  I thought it was perfect, seeing that I eat a mostly vegetarian diet.  I went in, not knowing what to expect and I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised.  I looked at the menu and saw the typical Korean fare...but also noticed these dishes referred to as \"Soon Tofu\".  Being the adventurous eater that I am, I ordered the Vegetable Soon Tofu.  Promptly after I placed my order, my waitress came out with the standard banchan - Kimchi, Tofu, Soya Beans and Bean Sprouts.  Yum.  (It was also unlimited!!)  Shortly after, my waitress came out to my table pushing a cart.  I thought to myself \"this dinner looks like it's going to be complicated.\"  My waitress placed a steaming hot stone (granite?) bowl of thick red stew with pieces of soft tofu simmering in it.  She then placed a small egg on the table.  And then scooped out steaming hot rice into a bowl.  Complicated was right.  I anxiously looked around to see what everyone else was doing...but everyone just seemed to be enjoying.  I humbly asked the waitress, \"um. what am I supposed to do with this?\" and pointed at the egg.  She giggled and picked up the egg, and cracked the yolk into my bowl.  She then gestured for me to break up the yolk and mix it around.  So I did.  And this was the beginning of my new favourite 'comfort' food.    I tried to eat as much as I could - but to no avail.  When I was done, the waitress came back and poured some hot broth into the stone bowl that the rice was clearly cooked in.  I didn't know what I was supposed to do with that.  So I just tried to drink it.  But I didn't like it as much.  I got my bill, and it was something ridiculous (in a good way) - like $8 (not including tip) for me to leave feeling super satisfied.  I always go back here whenever I'm craving 'comfort' food on the cheap and too lazy to cook.  My fiancee (the pickiest eater) also likes it. The only thing that stops us from going here more frequently is that we often leave feeling 'TOO FULL'.  The service is always great.  The food is always delicious.  The prices are always inexpensive.  GO HERE."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Korean restaurants and this is hands down, the best value when balancing quality, good service, and price.  It's my go-to spot whenever I'm in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Been craving Korean food for a while so I ended up at Tofu Village with some Yelp research.  I've only been to ayce Kbbq joints so Tofu Village was a pleasant surprise.  I was interested in trying the Soon Tofu, but found out it was hot soup, so I'll leave that for another visit during winter. My aunt and I ended up with the 'safe' choices...  - Bulgogi - Galbi - Bibimbap - Side dishes (kimchi, tofu, sprouts and spicy tofu) No complaints here... Everything was DELICIOUS! So many different flavours... A great balance of sweet, salt, spice and tang especially with the kimchi which wasn't overly spicy.   Service was all smiles and quick. No need to ask for water as they give you a pitcher when you sit. A nice touch when they decided to move us to a larger table since they realized we'll need more space for the food.  A must try when you're in the area... Or just go out of your way to eat there ;) I'm glad I did!  Yelp says they do delivery, but I asked the guy when I was paying and he said they don't... Boo =("}
{"text":"Tired and hot wandering around Koreatown, I popped into the first restaurant I saw that didn't look too pricey, and was very happy with what I found. Even having been around NYC's K-town and Korea, I found a dish that was unique (or either I haven't been looking hard enough at menus!), which was a spicy pork bulgogi over rice in a hot stone bowl. It really, really hit the spot! The pork was cooked just to the right tenderness, with a delicious glaze that was more to the spicy side than the normally sweet bulgogi marinade. It blended perfectly with the warm rice, quickly becoming crispy on the sesame oil-coated sides of the hot stone bowl. The portion was huge for the price and despite being hungry, I could only get through a good 1/2 or 2/3 of it before hitting my limit.   *Best meal I had among otherwise lousy eats in Toronto*"}
{"text":"Love the vege soon tofu here, they give you lots of vege and the tofu is equally as good as the ones in buk chang dong. Love the sides too."}
{"text":"Buk Chan Dong, move over. There's a new love in my life.  Highlights: kimchi (the freshest I have ever had) and soon tofu (delicious whether with meat or vegetarian).   The tofu here is softer and better quality than anywhere else I've been, and the broth is amazing. I literally did not leave a drop behind - and, even so, I never got that feeling of MSG, heavy sodium, or grease that so often lurks behind such a meal (sorry, BCD). Their kimchi (which comes with food) is also good enough to ask for thirds (or fourths, or fifths...). For $10 after tax and tip, I'd be hard pressed to find a better meal in the city. Bulgogi did not blow minds, though.  Of note, I wouldn't expect to get a table easily if you're in a party of 3+ during peak hours. With 5+, you'll be waiting longtimes. So show up in advance, or call, if you have a bigger party - it'll be worth it.  I'll be back. Just try and stop me."}
{"text":"Worst experience here! 4.5 stars? Come on Toronto! The service was horrible and involved the waitress slamming down side plates WITH A SCOWL without even making eye contact or acknowledging me. I noticed the side plates weren't very exiting; some places have really good ones. No seconds were offered.   The food was ok but not any better than anywhere else. The prices were more expensive than other places in the area. They do not accept any credit cards at all OR debit cards on transactions of under $20. No cash only sign on door. Was forced to use their RIP-OFF ATM machine which of course has a fee. How sleazy of them to treat their customers like that, to save themselves a 30 cent fee. Hope it's even safe. Such a horrible experience at every step. I'll be returning to my usual Korean place where it comes to $11 and it's way better."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their mul naengmyeon. I will not go anywhere else in Koreatown. On a hot day this cold noodle soup is the best to eat. I suggest 4 squirts of vinegar and if you're into spice, a healthy serving of the hot mustard paste. The only negative is that it's not served with crushed ice, pear slices and could use more pickled radish (It's possible that its a normal amount but I love pickled radish). Note that it is not served with meat.  Expect to be served about 4 side dishes (free of charge). I'm very picky with my kimchi. Here I'm always asking for seconds. My other favourite side dish is the tofu and brocolli.  Two people can eat here and be full for under $25 with tax and tip. Winning!"}
{"text":"Brilliant restaurant. Food and staff are the very best. Prices are very reasonable - slightly more than other Korean restaurants in the area but ambiance, food and staff are well worth the extra dollar"}
{"text":"Best Korean tofu I've had in Toronto :) there's plenty of space and a relaxed atmosphere. I will be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered the Kimchi soontofu, medium spicy, comes with a bit of pork, which was a subtley much appreciated. The soup came bubbling hot, and the rice was also served in a stone pot. A few side dishes, true to Korean food fare made the unbearable wait a little less torturous.   The service is prompt, friendly and checks up on you. The restaurant is clean :)  They don't rush you to leave, I've been nursing my pot belly for a solid 20. So happy."}
{"text":"- 2.5 stars - i will have to come back. why? because i didnt have the soon tofu. and it's the house of it, for pete's sake!! - instead, i tried the pork bone soup. i think it may have been an off night, because it was not as rock solid as i thought it was going to be. maybe the abundance of peppercorns ruined the experience for me. when i say peppercorns, i'm not joking around. i feel like a pepper mill dumped on, and not in the nice garnish sort of way, but a hailstorm....  - i dont want to let one dish throw off my review.  - the place was your typical joint in k-town. nice and polite service from foreign exchange students, clean and bright atmosphere, not pretentious in the slightest, and rammed full of korean folks (good sign of great food). - i did enjoy the placement teaching me how to say \"i love you\" and \"bill please\" in korean. haha.  - like i said, i'll be back. you haven't seen the last of me tofu village."}
{"text":"Mmmm tofu stew is one of the most comforting dishes ever. I came here recently and for the two of us we shared their combination kalbi & house tofu stew with stone pot rice. I would highly recommend this although portions were just a bit smaller than we had hoped. No worries though because the side dishes are yummy and refillable.  The kalbi was flavourful and served on a sizzling plate. The house tofu stew came with beef, shrimp, and mini clams. They offer a range of spice levels for their stews and while I got the mild I thought it was actually pretty spicy!  Also want to note that their tea is pretty good which is a bonus. Service was okay but they are understaffed... there were only two workers out front serving all of the customers and cleaning the tables so it was hard to flag them down."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly server at Tofu Village Korean Restaurant. We were here Saturday had lunch. Korean pancake, glass noddles, pork bone stew. It was delicious. The server kept top up the kimchi. Reason price and good food."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of great vegetarian options if you or any of your friends are vegetarian so you'd like mixed options. In spite of its moniker, there is the usual selection of chicken/beef/seafood, etc.   It's a great budget restaurant, so the ambiance isn't anything special, but to grab a casual or quick bite, it's a good option for Koreatown. I usually get the Bibimbap which never fails to disappoint. The portions are big, and come with bean sprouts, tofu, kimchi and sesame potatoes.   The service is ALWAYS extremely friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"This was a great experience all around! I don't have a lot of familiarity with Korean food, i have eaten at a few places over the years and just order whatever someone else is having. I went here on my own and asked my server for advice on what to get and she was very helpful. I decided on the Bi Bim Bop with some chicken.  As you can see in the photo I got a tonne of food. all of this came to $15 with tax and tip and I was stuffed and couldn't even finish it all, but i sure did try! The kimchee was amazing and everything was delicious. I am a new meat eater so the chicken was a bit intense for me, it was dark meat and had lots of flavor but a bit too strong for me.  The service was great my main server checked in with me a couple of times and was genuine and happy. Another staff member made sure I had enough kimchee and offered me more which I had...  I would certainly recommend. it was clean and cheerful, there were families here eating with kids and a business lunch meeting happening. lots of possibilites and very welcoming."}
{"text":"This place was recommended for dinner by a friend I was eating with. Our party of three arrived shortly after 630pm on a Friday night and we were luckily seated right away at one of the only tables left.  My friend raved about the pork soon tofu here which has bits of ground pork in the usual tofu stew. If you're craving pork bone soup and soon tofu at the same time then this is definitely the dish to order!  My table ordered 3 pork soon tofus all with mild spice level. The soon tofu came with purple rice in their stone pots so you get that nice layer of crispy rice at the end of your meal if you prefer. You also get to crack a raw egg into the soon tofu so that the soup cooks it down in the hot soup.  The restaurant got fairly busy shortly after we ordered but we were never rushed out of the restaurant by the waitresses and waiters even after we finished our meal.   All in all, a super enjoyable experience and will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options! Food is really good, great value and fast service. I had a friend from South Korea that just moved to Canada and was feeling a bit home sick... she really enjoyed this place and said it reminded her of exactly the food she ate back home. Talk about authentic!"}
{"text":"Great food! They give you large portions so you don't leave hungry. The place can get pretty busy."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We waited forever for menus. When we ordered, I asked if my chap jae could be made spicy. The man taking our order said \"NO\". Ok.my friend asked for hers very spicy. He growled. Food was very expensive. This is the second time I've been here. The service was just as bad the last time. Why did I come back?"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place.  Definitely try their tofu soups. They're delicious and comes with purple rice (they probably have a proper name).  They can get busy but if you're in Korea town in Toronto, it is worth a shot.  Service is typical of other restaurants in the area. They're all Korean and speak very basic English but are very polite."}
{"text":"A different experience eating tofu! It's funny to see Yelpers here arguing whether Tofu Village is better or the one few shops away! I think the best way to solve all your confusions is to try those two competitive restaurants lol haha! I tried both, and I like both! (In different ways!)  Side dishes I like: sweet potatoes (instead of carrots in most restaurants) and tofu! (This really suits the theme of the restaurant: Tofu! )  Tea was great too! (I like tea a lot and a lot and a lot.....)  Funny: You can learn some Korean if you want - Translations of normal useful words printed on the paper below your food! Although I am not a Korean, I think those words would be some really polite words. I would rather learn to be a real Korean to say what they usually say to the waiters/ waitresses:(  Of course I ordered TOFU stew in a tofu shop right. One spicy and one medium spicy; both not spicy to us.  Eggs came separately. Rice came in a pot; no water was put inside (which I like it because it's easier to eat the rice!). I like to put my rice into the tofu stew normally, but this time the pot remained so hot (not spicy though) that I could not even drink the soup! So I put my soup into my rice and it worked nicely!  That was a greaaaaat experience!"}
{"text":"I always go to Tofu Village after having a haircut nearby; despite how this street is filled with a lot of good restaurants, I feel like tofu village hits the spot for my freezing soul in winter (or colder weather in general). I love the tofu here, price is super reasonable, and the quality is great! First off, the tofu, super silky smooth and flavorful, one of the best tofu in Toronto! Soup is great, with 3 levels of spiciness but I always opt for medium spicy which gives me just enough kick and not be overwhelmed by spice. The meat/seafood is just side as compared to the tofu, although still very good. Lastly the rice, I love the purple rice, it is supposedly to be healthy and comes inside a hot stone bowl which keeps the rice hot/warm for the whole time! I will surely be revisiting again and again!"}
{"text":"I didn't think the soon tofu + kalbi combo could get any better, but evidently, it could if you order the Seafood Tofu Pancakes, which re awesome.  Get a House Special Soon Tofu + Pancakes and it's really quite fulfilling for 2 people!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It is the epitome of comfort food.   Awesome kimchi, seafood pancake. Really, anything you get is super fresh, tasty and overall - soothing for the soul.   The service may be a bit hit and miss, but I barely notice it when I am tucking into an awesome meal.   The decor is clean and simple. The bathroom (as per all Toronto restaurants - located in the basement) is clean.   On my last visit with Danielle P and Avitania B - a hush fell over the table when the food arrived. Avitania and I discussed how at Tofu Village, you feel the need to eat fast. Fast gobbles because it is so good and you don't want to miss a morsel.   Cannot recommend enough."}
{"text":"The search for the best Pork Bone Soup continues! Now this place is a pretty good candidate for one of the top 3 on the Korean strip. It comes down to whether you like peppercorn in your soup or not.   As far as the locale, the House of Tofu is one of the better looking low-end restaurants in Korea town. The staff is friendly, spoke above average English for what it is expected in this area of town --that's a plus for someone like who speak no Korean. The decour although spartan is clean and quite serviceable at this price point and very much a few levels upward from locales like say, Owl of Minerva, where the word 'dingy' comes to mind.  It's about $9 for soup, tax and tip, so it is pretty much on par with the rest. Now, unlike Seoul Restaurant where I found their \"extra spicy\" to be very mild, TV's PBS was quite spicy and the broth tasted as if it had been boiling for hours. So a solid broth with a lasting taste, my kind of pork bone soup.   My friend also praised it except for the fact that it lacked peppercorn which he likes -- I do not.  The fat content was not too bad either so I would have to say that from all the places I have been trying as of late, TV seems to be the best one so far.   I will definitely be back to continue exploring the rest of their menu. I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Holy crap. This place is amazing. The service is great and their pork bone soup is pretty amazing. I think I've found a new obsession. $9 for PBS tax and tip in? I say yes!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten the bibimbap and tofu soup here. The mixed rice dish was pretty good but it doesn't come with any beef, the only protein is an egg on top.  I had the beef tofu and it came out boiling hot which was great for the egg to be cooked in it! However, the beef was scarce.. there was only a few tiny pieces, but the tofu was plentiful. The soup was a little bland too, I've tasted better.  I'm only giving it two stars because of the service, the waitresses were being very pushy. I know it was dinner time and there was a line-up.. but I barely sat down to eat my tofu soup.. which by the way, is very hot so it takes awhile to eat. They kept asking us if we finished eating and if they could take our plates. The waitress then proceeds to wipe the table down before we even put on our coats and directs new customers to our table. I felt really rushed and it just wasn't a comfortable experience."}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky about my Korean food and this place didn't do it for me. I had the Bulgogi dinner which was okay but was so watery - which makes me think that it was cooked frozen.  The service was to par but food was not. 2 stars is just about right."}
{"text":"I don't live in Canada or Korea anymore but Sundubu Maeul (Tofu Village) is on my short list of places to eat when I come home to visit family.  For me, a trip to Toronto isn't complete unless I have my sundubu jjiggae from Tofu Village.  It's the closest thing I've found in Canada to the Korean food I love and miss so much.  The restaurant is staffed with friendly servers and the Sundubu here is great, as are the side dishes that come with your meal!  They also serve other dishes which my friends have tried and liked them as well."}
{"text":"There are probably countless other delicious and possibly better Korean restaurants in the neighbourhood, but it's still taking me forever to try them all because we keep going back to Tofu Village.  We (party of 2) always order the dolsot bibimbap with \"vegetables & vegetables\" ($10) and a seafood soon tofu ($8) to share, though when we went the other day it was way too humid for hot soup. You know what they say: when life gives you lemons, make NAENGMYEON. Our introduction to Korean cold noodle soup, it was super tasty and refreshing. The veggie bibimbap (sprouts, carrot, mushroom, egg, life-changing crispy rice) is always great but priced the same as the meat entrees, as is the unfortunate norm.  I love all the side dishes, particularly the tofu with broccoli and the syrupy-sweet potatoes, which don't always make an appearance.  We got a combo once not realizing that it wouldn't come with rice, so now we just order everything separately. I enjoy the big rice bowl that accompanies the soon tofu because it makes the meal just filling enough. Especially if you're with a hungry date. You know what they say: it takes a (Tofu) village to feed a dude."}
{"text":"The best Korean I've had!! All thanks to Lauren for holding a UYE here! And I'm so happy that \"spicy\" actualy meant spicy! So be warned if you're someone that does not handle spice well, even the \"medium\" spicy level might be too much. Although I found there to be a bigger gap between \"medium\" and \"spicy\" than I thought there would be.  My first go at Soon tofu, it arrives boiling and when you crack the raw egg in to it, it cooks almost instantly. So delicious and a must for a winter warm up!   I made 2 trips within a span of a week and ran in to fellow second timer Roma (who was also at the UYE) which should speak volumes about the impression that Tofu Village had on us.  I'm so thankful I now have a solid option when thinking about dining at Korea Town.   Staff are friendly but they could be a bit more attentive to your needs. But I don't believe that it deserves a less than 5 star review for that. You will be too busy with your food to care about people paying attention to you!"}
{"text":"I like this place and always come back here for Vege Soon Tofu or Vege bimbibap. They serve four (4) kinds of side dishes which I always enjoy.  It's very casual place, so good to stop by, eat, and go!"}
{"text":"Great spot for Korean on Bloor. Love that they always have good kimchi and give rice in the stone bowls. The tofu pancakes are really good albeit a bit greasy. They offer several types of soon tofu as well as other options. One of our regular stops for Korean."}
{"text":"Tofu village is one of my favourite places if I'm craving for soon tofu. I went here for lunch today and ordered the usual house special which consists of beef, two small clams, shrimp and of course tofu. I found the service very strange..the Korean waitress scooped our rice from the wooden box into a bowl for us, and then bringing it back at the end with  water. The many, many times that i've been here, they never done that before ! Was it because my bf is Korean and the waitress was being super nice? We even had our teas refilled many times, placed more extra napkins, etc. I feel like service such as that should be the same for everyone.   Anyways, great place but can be busy! I overheard they only take debit or credit if it's over $20? Not 100% sure."}
{"text":"HOLY geez this place is excellent. I first stumbled upon this restaurant through reading yelp reviews and boy it did not disappoint. I really love tofu so this place was perfect for my tofu needs. I ordered the soon tofu kimchi, and soon means \"soft\" in  Korean. It was served with purple rice (I forgot to ask what type of rice that is but it was some kind of bean rice) and ground pork, plus some raw eggs on the side to crack in the hot boiling soup. It was so hot that I was crying while eating it from the hot temperature but it was so worth it. The tofu really was soft and the broth was medium spicy and flavorful.   There was yummy banchan and the kimchi was just perfect. The service? Really quite something. The waiters/waitresses were open to questions that we had about the dishes and culture of drinking soju. They even told us about how we could eat the remaining rice stuck on the stone pot by putting hot water in it. It honestly wasn't my favorite taste but it reminded me of barley tea or some kind of congee. Still, very interesting.   Overall, my friends and bf enjoyed this place and their dishes. Great spot if you're looking for good food in KoreaTown. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We thought we would try something different than the usually Buk Change Dong (BCD) tonight.    The place just doesn't have the same vibe as the busy and energetic one down the street. But they offer more than just Soon Tofu, and Bimbimbap.   I can't compare the soup with the one at BCD because I've never had it there (only the best bimbimbap ever, and the bulgogi soup), but this one was good, but not as flavorful as I expected (i did get mild though).  The purple rice come with it, but she does not scoop it in a bowl like BCD, and instead you eat it straight from the stone bowl.  Something about the height difference from the two bowls made it difficult to eat.   Soon Tofu ($6.95) Soon Tofu + Galbi ($14.95) - Soon tofu was smaller slightly Galbi with rice ($10.95) - we were hungry and ordered another. It was the same size was the one that comes with the soup  The pricing here is off for sure.   The service was really good. the Girls here are really nice, but they seem to be working under an overbearing father here as an older gentleman would stand in the back with arms crossed and a frown on his face the whole time.   They also serve Japchae, Pork Bone soup, Bulgolgi and other traditional korean dishes.   I would come back only if BCD was full...."}
{"text":"Had a hankering for some Korean food the other night, and waded through the many Korea-town restaurant reviews and narrowed things down to Buk Chang Dong Soon.  Opted for this one simply because it was bigger and seemed more comfortable for lunch on a dreary Sunday.  Glad to report that it was as good as I was hoping for.  We appreciated the fact that they had moderately-priced combos that gave us both Soon Tofu and BBQ, since we love variety.  The banchan side dishes were great, especially the kimchi (mouth watering now, just thinking about it).  The Soon Tofu was new to both of us, but after this experience, we'll definitely be ordering it again - came with shrimp, clams, beef and plenty of silky tofu.  Service was perfect - friendly, efficient and surprisingly fast."}
{"text":"Please try the galbi stone bowl. It's amazing. Service is great and I found the server to be very nice and attentive. It's located in a area full of other korean restaurants. But I found them to be very accommodating. When I come to Korea town. This will be my go to restaurant as many places undercook the galbi. But they make it just right."}
{"text":"Good food and affordable. Happy with the customer service- they are always very polite"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go for soon tofu.  Great apps and the rice is in the stone pot."}
{"text":"I came downtown to give this top ten a Korean restaurant a try today. My daughter had a pork bone soup. She gave me a little and tried and the meat are very tender and the soup tastes very good. I order the dumpling and tofu soup. It came with purple rice on stone bowl. This also tastes very good. The service was quick and friendly. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because the place need to be upgrade. The food is a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Judging a book by its cover, judging a Korean restaurant by their kimchi- this place has the freshest assortment of banchan (especially the kimchi). The waitresses/waiter are super attentive and patient with explaining the dishes. Any of the dishes are great and service is fairly quick! I always come back here when I'm hankering for Korean!"}
{"text":"Why did I go to Tofu Village for GALBI($10.95)?!?  Beef Ribs that I can taste some marinade but was still weak.  The girl at least was super nice to cut it into bite size pieces to order, my orders!  Galbi  -0.5 * Girl     +0.5 * =         0.0         Additional to my prior review  UYE: Battle Korean Soon Tofu.   susan c. - Thanks for planning a great evening.  The customer beside us was super friendly and ahead of the game knowing we need an extra seat for our late arrival.  5 *Stars* to that lady.  Seafood Pancake was aight.  Crispy but I won't rate it as I didn't really have much of it.  Enjoy the Food Photos!"}
{"text":"Wow. Their pork soon tofu is amazing. So filling and so cheap. I love the rice and the soon tofu put together - it's an amazing combo, very light, and you don't feel gross after eating there at all.  Great service and prices, good atmosphere. Will definitely come again  *Update* I've been told Buk Chang Soon Tofu (about half a block away from Tofu Village) is also really good. I can say that i've tried both, and I much prefer Tofu Village. Their soup base is just much more flavourful and they give tons and tons of tofu. Their portion of rice is also bigger. Both are good, but Tofu Village one-ups Buk Chang"}
{"text":"I've never had an actual sizzling pot of food brought to me, so, to my surprise when I ordered the chicken bimbibap, I was amazed and excited to dig in. The food was great; not OMG-mouth-watering-amazing-great, but I enjoyed the spicy kimchi (which I have never tried before- LOVE IT!) and mild tofu offered as side dishes. Delicious. When ordering the grilled chicken bimbibap, I asked for brown rice, as I do not eat processed white rice, so I was very pleased that I could make this modification for (less pleased with) an additional price of $1. The pot itself included shredded carrots, caramelized tofu bits, bean sprouts, zuchinni, tofu squares and an egg yolk right in the middle. The food was so hot, the egg yolk actually COOKED! That was pretty neat, and the child inside me was quite amused.  My only displeasures with the food was the small little portion of chicken they gave me in my CHICKEN bimbibap.... Probably measuring out to about less than 1/4th of a cup... A very measly portion of chicken. You would think this *chicken* bimbibap would include a large portion of chicken. Guess not. Anyway, I loved the atmosphere and the area. The restaurant was clean, refreshing and friendly, the servers were inviting and informative on food ingredients and preparations. I liked it and I enjoyed my culture-shock experience. Will return in the near future."}
{"text":"The mighty Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu has some competition in town!  Tofu Village is a new player in the Annex's tofu game...and it's fantastic.  Here are my notes:  1. The soon tofu is da bomb bizzle.  The Chinese would say that it's more \"waht\" than the tofu at Buk Chang.  That means the shiz be silky smooth like my botoxed balls, ya heard?  A bargain at $7.  2. There's a damn spicy cold noodle dish for $9 or $10.  Like a Jarvis Street hooker, it burns so good (so I am told).  There's also a nice egg and tofu pancake app for $6 or $7 that is forgettable, but not regrettable.   3. There's a serious lack of menus here.  Maybe five for the whole restaurant, so they need to recycle them from table-to-table.  4. It's usually less busy than Buk Chang, though I suspect this might change as word gets out.  If Buk Chang has a long line-up, do yourself a favour and walk four doors east to Tofu Village.  5. Since they're trying to impress, the staff attentiveness is quite good...for now.  I suspect that in time, it will degrade to the more standard \"eat fast and get out immediately\" attitude of service.  6. There's paper place mats that have \"learn Korean\" on them.  So when you're prepared, you can say \"sa rang hae yo\"!  You may need to learn Korean to eat here since the servers don't understand much English.  From what I can see, there's definitely enough demand for another tofu baron in town."}
{"text":"Bearing in mind that I just love bulgogi/bulgoki (however one wants to spell it) I have tried it in various different locations. I did not have high hopes for this establishment, mainly because I rarely have high hopes. I went in with an open mind waiting to see if my tastebuds would be delighted.  My bulgoki was a little overcooked, and was in very large chunks. This made it difficult to eat, as at some points I could barely chew for the vast amounts of meat & rice I had in my mouth. The rice was cooked well, the side dishes were acceptable - can't do too much wrong with bean sprouts, kimchi, and tofu.  The establishment was very clean, airy and had a very welcome feel to it.  My dining companion had the pork bone soup, which looked more appetising to me than my bulgoki.   I will return, to try other dishes. My other passion is bimbimbap, so I hope to give it a try. The only good I've ever had was in London by the British Museum and I am hoping my tastebuds will have orgasms somewhere in Toronto."}
{"text":"I would like to go everyday for tofu soup! This place makes the best tofu soup in town, sorry if I haven't tried enough to say this.   The service is good, very fast, very friendly."}
{"text":"SOONDUBU!!!!  I don't think I've ever had such silky and smooth tofu ever before in my life until I tried Tofu Village. I was super taken aback by the first bite of the tofu when I tried the House Soon Tofu, the first bite seems to almost melt in your mouth!  I think their soondubu is insanely delicious and comparable to Buk Chang's; it also makes you feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. I ordered mild, which was actually quite spicy for me at first only to realize that it was because I didn't mix in the spice well into the soup...needless to say, I found that out the hard way through a burnt tongue and the sensation of swallowing a mace. So I can't really quite sure about how spicy the broth really is, but I would say that the mild is probably a bit less spicy than Buk Chang's mild. I get a very generous serving of tofu from Tofu Village though, my bowl was filled with enormous chunks of tofu!   The only slightly complaint I have about this place is the rice though, it was rather on the dry side and didn't have the moist or sticky texture that I hoped for. Also, the rice will stick onto the clay pot which the server will offer to pour hot tea into so you can eat the rice. The water certainly helped me scrape the rice from the pot, but the bottom was crusty and still really dry. For this, I would have to say Buk Chang has better rice since I have gotten moist and sticky rice from them on every occasion I have been there. But, I think the tofu here at Tofu Village is slightly more silky and smooth. The taste of the jjigae is about the same, so it mostly boils down to your preference of rice/tofu/banchan/drinks.   The banchan at Tofu Village is great! I actually much prefer the banchan here over the ones given at Buk Chang. They give you quite a great amount here; (marinated?) tofu, kimchi, bean sprouts, beans, (spiced?) tofu. I have a particular affinity for the beans served as banchan, and I prefer the ones served here over Buk Chang's. The banchan served here is seriously good, it's quite the variety and delicious! Also, I really like the tea here (roasted rice? not quite sure), I personally prefer to drink tea over plain water itself so it's a nice touch!   I'm not really demanding on service and I don't have anything to complain about here. I think the service was really nice, the servers were attentive and refilled tea regularly. One of the servers saw my struggle in scraping the rice and offered to pour tea into the pot, and checked up on me regularly to make sure everything was okay. They also made sure that I was cautious in handling my jjigae, warning me that it was extremely hot and to be extra careful. Food came relatively quick which may or may not be due to a slow day. Decor is nothing flashy but comforting, and they offer Wifi (they totally had me there)!. The bill came to a total of $8.98, which I think is totally worth it considering how filling and generous the meal was.   Overall, I probably will return now and then depending on my preference of banchan/rice. I am really happy with my experience and if the rice was just more moist and sticky, I would definitely visit here anytime I'm in the area without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Very impressed!  Excellent food & service!  They have roasted rice tea (which was so fragrant and delicious), and the waiters kept coming around to fill up our cups. They are very friendly and available, there's always someone to come and help you and they greeted when we came and left.  My friends and I shared a couple of dishes:  #3 Pancake (appetizer) I forget whether this was the Kimchi version, but it had onions and tofu inside. Sticky like stir fried radish, and oily, with some crispy crunch.  #1 Jap Chae  Stir fry sweet potato noodles! Under the appetizer section, this was a pretty big dish, it's a meal sized plate. It was sticky, with hints of sesame oil and pepper and a little sweetness of some sort.  #11 House Special Soon Tofu (plain) The tofu is so silky and I like that the dish is not salty. There was some beef, shrimps, shellfish as well. Embarrassingly, we had to ask how to eat the dish (you crack the egg into the soup while it's hot and stir it. Then you add in the rice from the stone pot into the soup)  #36 BBQ something Rice Very flavourful and I was impressed at how TENDER the meat was--delicious!  What I like most is that each dish has its own flavour. Great experience! I would come back here again. I have nothing to complain about this place. We didn't even have to wait at all on a weekday evening.   Note: The menu in person is different than the one on the website, so the numbers may be different when you go. (sorry, I should've taken a picture of the menu!)"}
{"text":"I'll admit -- I'm not the biggest fan of soon tofu soup. Too red and bubbly. On the other hand, what I *do* enjoy is dol sot bibimbap -- and Tofu Village makes it quite well. The hot stone pot is hot enough that I there's yummy the crusty/burny rice at the bottom. Plus, there's plenty of veggies and meat -- perfect for filling up for cheap. I only wish the eggs they used were bigger; the yolks are so tiny!  If you're feeling particularly hungry, go with a friend and order some galbi to go with your meal. It's marinated just right, and cooked so tender! So so delicious.   It does get a little bit crowded in the evenings, so when you go to Tofu Village, eat quick! the sooner they can turn the table, the sooner I can sit down and eat! :)"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Pork Bone Soup here. Also, don't forget to take cash as they only accept cards over $20"}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with this korean place!   I got the gamjatang, as it's my favourite dish; it came piping hot and with a lot of bones! I chose mild broth, and it had a good small amount of heat. The broth could of been slightly more flavorful, however. I wish there was slightly more vegetables, such as onions and nappa. But for the price, it's pretty good value!  Banchan included kimchi, beans, sprouts, tofu, and radish, which was a good mix! However, I wish they had the potatoes and/or seaweed like other places.  The place can get really cold if you're near the window, as there's a draft, so make sure to dress warmly!"}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 8/10 Drink: n/a Service: 8/10 Value: 7/10 Hygiene: 8/10 Aesthetics: 7.5/10  I came here cause a few friends were craving Korean food and it was one of the closer ones in the area  I ended up getting the special tofu stew (the one with beef and seafood). The flavours were decent and it was   The service here can sometimes be a little slow but there is nothing to really complain about.  The decor and atmosphere is pretty plain and simple. Nothing that really stands out or makes you go WOW.   The prices are reasonable. The combos cost a bit more and come with a smaller soup, but are still a decent deal.  This place is good for tofu stew. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Looking for something warm on a snowy day - I had the vegetable soon tofu. Boy, was it a lot of food! A full pot of sticky rice (what you typically get in a Bi bim bap), and 4-5 sides, plus a hot soup with soft tofu. I thought is was a lot of food, and then I realized all the sides had unlimited refills! So did the complimentary tea. And all this for around 9 USD!  The food itself was warm and very tasty. I'm no Korean food connoseiur, but this might be the best kimchi I've had to date!"}
{"text":"HIGHLY recommend this place if you're looking for a good and cheap eat with friends. I've gone here twice so far and don't have any complaints, to be honest.   Their soon tofu is good and will fill you up for about $10 - $15 with side dishes and rice and whatnot. If you're still a little hungry, try their pork bulgogi because it's really good as well. They have other pretty generic dishes on the menu such as fried rice and dumplings.  The service here isn't over-the-top special, but it's still nice. I'd say about 99% of the time you are guaranteed to be greeted upon arrival. The best part about the workers here is that they're super happy when you tip them - almost like they've never been tipped before.   The atmosphere and interior of the place looks fairly nice. All the tables have paper placemats with Korean phrases; cute.   All in all, I give Tofu Village 5 stars and will definitely make another visit."}
{"text":"This place is too die for!! I love ordering pork bbq and soon tofu combinations set. They also serve the most amazing kimuchi I've ever had. I really recommend Tofu Village!!!"}
{"text":"Along Bloor St West in the Christie Pits area there's a lot of popular Korean restaurants and bars.  Thankfully a close friend of Jen's was having a small get together at this place. Tofu Village up on entering is bustling with lots of customers, it's not a fancy place by any means, but its the service and food that keeps its regulars and new folks coming back. For food I let Jen take care of the orders as she had more insight as to what to eat, here's the breakdown:  Spicy tofu with seafood, served in a boiling bowl of delicious broth. You can either get it mild or spicy.  Bim bim bap, served in a cast iron bowl infused with lots of vegetables and meat all mixed together with rice.  Soju, can't say no, but it was delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"Now what on earth do you write in a review of a place you love to death?  I discovered this place through an Elite-pre-party event organized by the lovely Lauren, and you better believe she's one of the most valuable Toronto Elite members out there.   I pretty much tried this place more than a month ago, and have been back numerous times since. The evening staff recognizes me immediately, maybe since I keep ordering the same thing; Soon Vegetable Tofu.   The service is fantastic; everyone is attentive, polite and efficient. In fact, based on the food and service alone it's much better than Buk Chang."}
{"text":"came last week on one of the coldest days. we actually wanted to go to soon tofu but it was packed, our friends said tofu village was just as good - they weren't wrong. i absolutely love soup and usually get pork bone, but i do love tofu. their set meals are great and comes with all the usual side dishes as you do at most Korean restaurants. i ordered the bbq pork with the original house soup. it was served so quickly and camd steaming, which is the PERFECT. i only like my soup served boiling, as it should be. the house speak was served with generous amounts of tofu, rice and a large sizzling hotplate of hot bbq pork. the soup was delicious and so flavourful, completely satisfying on a freezing day! i finished the soup and majority of the tofu, half the rice - only 1/4 of the pork was left. i definitely can't wait to be back for more soup!"}
{"text":"This was my fist but won't be my last time here. Although the price has gone up and is now $9.75 for tofu soup, the flavor and portions are good. The service was prompt and the girls were very friendly. It comes out to $13 for tax and tip."}
{"text":"Most places in Koreatown are very good, but this place is even better than the usual high standard, in my opinion. The Soon tofu will change your mind about the value of silken tofu if you, like me, don't generally think it's any good. In Tofu Village soup, it's luxuriant and rich, almost like soft boiled egg. The barbecue is fantastic and the pancakes are my favorite! They serve several smaller, easier to deal with pancakes rather than one huge one, and they're crispy and perfect. Overall, this is my new favorite Korean. So far, at least! I want to try them all!"}
{"text":"Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu, which actually happens to be near here, used to be my favourite place for tofu soup until I came to try Tofu Village. Buck Chang is way more popular, but I personally prefer the menu selection at Tofu Village.  In terms of the tofu soup itself, I do actually think the Buk Chang is slightly better, but my problem with tofu soup is that it usually isn't enough to fill me up if I'm actually hungry. You can try to fill yourself up with an extra bowl of rice, but that's really just unnecessary carbs you're ingesting for the sake of feeling full. Tofu Village provides a good amount of food with their combinations - you can choose a combination of tofu with bibimbap, bulgoki (Korean beef), or galbi (Korean ribs, the one I recommend). Their combinations cost about $15, which is quite cheap considering you're actually getting two entrees. Of course you can always order items separately if you don't have as big of an appetite.  They provide you with a good selection of side dishes along with your meal, like at most decent Korean restaurants. The service is quick and friendly, and it is conveniently located right next to the PAT Korean supermarket, which offers free parking (and fish-shaped cakes). I think you're supposed to buy something for the free parking, but I usually grab stuff from the supermarket anyway so it's not a problem for me.  They don't have a big selection of the type of tofu soup you can get, but I usually find that all the different types of tofu soup taste the same anyway with just minor differences in the ingredients. Sometimes they do run out of the rice served in stone pots if you come later at night, but I honestly can't tell the difference between that rice and a bowl of white rice. I eat the rice with my soup anyway so it just ends up tasting like the soup base either way.  Just don't forget to crack your egg right as they serve you the tofu soup!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Over a year from my initial review of this place, and it is STILL the most amazing tofu soup place in Toronto.  And yet, they have SO much more different foods to offer than of a regular tofu soup place like BCD on the corner of Clinton and Bloor.  My latest fave eats are their seafood pancakes.  They are made out of crack.  Completely addictive.  And the #17 combo I get ALL the time (the wait staff know me and what I will always order every time I go) - the kalbi + tofu soup (+ $1.00 if you change the type of soup in the combo - I usually ask for kimchi soon tofu) has the most tender and amazingly tasty, flavorful kalbi marinade.  Deliciousness all around.  And great wait staff - Wow.  Kudos to them al!"}
{"text":"The name is certainly a mouthful: Rod Torfulson's Tofu Village - House of Soon Tofu featuring Herman Menderchuck. I'll just call it \"The Village\". The Village is quite clean and spacious. Back in the day, K-town eateries were rather dingy places and the appearance of a whitey customer was met with equal amounts of fear, surprise, and suspicion. You'd have to ask for kimchi. Gone are those days. Service was really quite nice.  I had the chicken teriyaki in the stone bowl. I enjoy the stone bowl (dol sot) eats but wanted to try something different from bibimbap (cooked rice that has been bibimed). I'd not advise it. It wasn't very flavorful. But a few squirts of gochu jang (Korean red pepper sauce) brought out some better flavor.  The banchan was somewhat minimal but I really loved their tofu drizzled in sesame oil. It was like a nice cheese. I got here at 12:30 pm on a Sunday and I was the only person in here. But it filled up by 1-1:30. Maybe it does a big after church trade? Patrons were evenly mixed between Koreans and whitey."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends for dinner. Ordered the BBQ chicken with teraki sauce. The chicken is not marinated and did not taste good at all. The server were attentive with refilling however got my order wrong. When I said this is not what I ordered, their reply was they already made it. Anyways in the end they finally brought what I ordered."}
{"text":"Very good dishes.   The tofu soup is amazing.  The service is also pretty good and fast.   The only thing is don't bother buy the seafood pancakes.  It's only a name and does not have seafood in it. So not worth the pricey pancakes here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for dinner with friends.  The place was fairly busy.  I ordered the pork bone soup.  I got mild but it tasted more like medium spicy. The Korean spiciness scale is above the regular scale.  The pork bone soup came with a bowl of rice.  It was very good.  Large chunks of pork bone, bean sprouts & lettuce.  Very filling.  The side dishes were pretty good too.  Will come back to try their other dishes.  Good friendly service."}
{"text":"Stopping in for dinner on a Friday night at Tofu Village was a great call. They have one of the nicer venues with some actual atmosphere going on, as compared with some of the more \"fast food\" like establishments along the strip. The decor is simple but clean with about 3 waitresses cycling around the 30 odd patrons. We were seated immediately and noticed all the tiny bubbling pots of soon tofu being consumed by the masses.  This being our first visit we decided to order the kitchen sink so to speak. Appetizers 1&2 on the menu seafood pancake and glass noodle with bits of veg&beef. They were each about $7-8? They were tasty but nothing above the cheaper options on the street. The pancakes included 3 hand-sized goodies but I found them slightly over-done on the edges. The noodles weren't terribly flavorful but went well as a base for some of the other dishes.   We also got two of the Soon Tofu combo meals (which is a great option if you want more than just Soon Tofu). The Galbi combo was $15 and came with a good amount of marinated beef ribs on a sizzling plate and a personal sized bowl of delicious, smooth and creamy soon tofu. The ribs were flavorful but a tad greasy and 1/3 fatty, still delicious though, on a bed of fried onions. I love that we were given a raw egg with each Soon pot as it was hot enough to crack on site and cook into the stew. The Dolsot bibimbap that came with the second combo ($14) was served hot hot hot! It was well made with a balanced amount of veggies and the raw yolk on top as usual cooked into the rice. The bottom of the rice caked onto the bottom a bit and although was ever so slightly burned in a couple spots it had an appealing crunchy texture. We were served a decent bowl of delicious purple rice on the side.   At this point I want to mention that the banchans were a bit underwhelming as only the standard 4 came out. This included kimchi, and Korean beansprouts (both of which I'm not inclined toward), some cold tofu, and my favorite, sweet marinated potato cubes. Our banchans were not refilled and I had to ask twice for a refill on the potatoes....I guess they save a bit of money this way.  Lastly the pork bone soup ($7) was pretty good, again though, you've gotta like those funky tasting Korean sprouts. There was a generous amount of meat which fell nicely off the bone. The broth was flavourful but my palette was more drawn to the Soon broth...I guess it would have been better not to mix the flavors. Also I got to mention that my gma was dining with us so we had to order everything mild. This probably dumbed down the flavors of the broths. :(  Anyways, the total bill for the 4 of us including tax and tip came to $60. We were stuffed and came home with a lunch sized takeout box. Though it's a bit pricier than most of the smaller places in the Korean village it still is a cheap eat at under $10 for most non-combo items. The service and atmosphere are worth the extra $$ for top notch food on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Atmosphere/ Service I came here during vacation in January. (excuse the late review!). There wasn't any wait for dinner. Once seated, the staff thoroughly explained the menu to us. Inside looks like a very casual yet spacious Korean restaurant.   Food Toronto is so cold during winter and all my friend and I were craving was something warm. Food came really fast with all the Korean side dishes. I ordered a kimchi tofu and it just hit the spot. I got it extra spicy and it really did have a kick. The tofu came out to less then 10$, which is a crazy good deal!"}
{"text":"They recently raised their prices a bit ($1 more?) but I think it's still worth checking out. They have a couple banchan and come with the rice in the stone pot. The tofu is always a silky smooth one, which is the right softness without breaking apart easily. Tastes fresh. I would definitely come back and recommend it."}
{"text":"- What I have tried:     + Short ribs on hot stone: It's basically marinated beef short ribs. This is my favourite dish, really really goooood. The meat was marinated so well and flavourful, and they gave you a generous amount of ribs.      + Pork bone soup: It's good, the soup was flavourful but I still prefer pork bone soup at Sunrise House just because they gave you more meat and price was much more affordable.      + Soon tofu soup with beef: I love love tofu soup here, it's what they are famous for. Flavour was very well balanced, much much better than tofu soup at Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu. love love love      + Vegetable bibimbap: I really like the sauce and everything that comes with this bibimbap. However, I'm a meat lover so I did get sick of it when i was half way done. It's not the bibimbap's fault tho, it was very good, but I don't recommend it if you are a meat lover like me.      + Bulgogi on rice: really good as well, but if I had to choose one, I would go with the short ribs one. Don't think it wrong, I still love both tho.      + They have the best side dishes I have ever tried, some are very different from other korean restaurants, really enjoyed it. - Portion: Generous,  one dish will definitely make you full. - Price: $$ a bit overpriced. I admit that their food is really good, but each person may have to pay up to $15-20 after taxes and tips for a dish. With this price, I don't think I will come here as often as Sunrise House.  - Very good customer service.  - The place was big and spacious, very nice and clean as well."}
{"text":"Downgrade. Though I still like the ability to get a soup/meat combo, my soon tofu was a disappointment. The flavour just wasn't there, and this wasn't helped by going to BCD just the night before. It's just...missing something.  Still very pleasant service, but between Seor Ak San (for the variety) and BCD (for the soup), I don't think we'll be coming back very often."}
{"text":"Oh my god, you have to get the gamjatang! The pork bone soup is delicious and the serving is generous; even if you think it's all bone, it's not! Eat rice, the banchan, and vegetables with the pork and soup and trust me, you'll be totally full at the end of the meal :) Granted it's not the best gamjatang you'll ever have, but at that price point? I've eaten my way through the Korean diaspora cities of Atlanta (Duluth, really...), Los Angeles, and NoVa area and the prices for gamjatang would be $25+ alone, to be honest. I was shocked to see it 10.95 CAD. It's a steal. For those of you that think it's pricey, it's really a steal. You're lucky to have Tofu Village.   Service was nice and I have no complaints, other than the rice; I've come to look forward to the stickier rice varieties (either white or purple) when eating Korean and this was just regular and somewhat mushier rice. Apparently there is a $2-3 upcharge for the fancy rice, which is a tad disappointing. However, you can't go wrong with a $10.95 gamjatang. I saw everyone ordering soondubu and I feel like gamjatang is the way to go here. Done raving!"}
{"text":"I come here whenever I'm craving for soon tofu.  They give you a raw egg to crack in the soup.  It comes with \"purple\" rice which I really like and find it unique.  The soon tofu tastes delicious and I'm always coming back for more!   Even though they're known for their tofu soon, I am craving for poke bone soup and have also gotten this a few time.  It's ~$10 for pork bone soup.  Their pork bone soup is a bit pricier compared to some other places in Korean Town (such that you can find cheaper pbs for $7 at Yummys Korean Restaurant, or even $8-$9 at many other restaurants).  They do have one or the best pork bone soup compared to other places I have tried.  I really do like their pork bone soup though and they are very consistent with it.  The amount of spice is right on, with not a lot of fat from the pork bone.  It comes with a bowl of white  rice.  It costs $1.50 more to substitute to \"purple rice\".   Their appetizer is good as well! I really enjoy the beans.  Their waitress are very friendly and will ask you if you want more appetizers even before you finish your first round."}
{"text":"Had the kimchi soon tofu. It was great, although scalding and not readily edible for the first 15 mins because of temperature. Flavors were bursting. Side dishes were great accompaniments. Service fast and courteous. Ambience nothing to write home about but no appalling nor dirty. And oh so cheap - $8 for all of that. Without a doubt, recommended. I will be back on this short Toronto trip."}
{"text":"The service is great, but the consistency of food isn't good (hit or miss situation even when it's the same dish). Dishes are typical, and can be found in many other restaurants. Variety of dishes were quite nice though. Prices are decent. The interior design and layout isn't anything spectacular, just a typical small restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here because I was carving soon tofu and it was pretty good. Got the pork one (as it was raved about by my fellow Yelpers, but I think I might have liked kimchi or dumplings better). The soup was super flavourful, the portion large with the stone pot rice, and the service super fast. It came with the little Korean side dishes that makes it feel more legit to me. My friend got the kalbi dinner and it was a few short ribs and rice.   Everything was moderately priced and the place filled up quickly. I will defnitely be back to try the other soon tofus."}
{"text":"Tofu Village definitely lives up to its name. I've gone several times and still dream about their soon tofu stew - just totally hits the spot for me. And by the way, this place FAR SURPASSES Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu (the flashier eatery just a few doors down), which is super bland in comparison.   To be honest, this is my go-to hangover spot: the comforting easy-to-eat tofu is balanced by a spicy kick of Korean chili broth; the quality side dishes are great to pick at if you have a queasy stomach. Also, the place is clean, the pretty waitresses are incredibly courteous and patient (maybe the best I've ever encountered in Koreatown), and the vibe is mellow and accepting.   Last time I went I ordered their oyster soon tofu stew (priced at $6.95, same as all the other stews) and it came with fresh raw oysters in the soup! Slightly briny, super fresh and a nice change from typical Korean pork/bulgogi. Can't wait to eat through the rest of their (extremely reasonably priced and pretty creative) menu!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I still prefer Sunrise House's beef and veg soondubu, but hey. This was pretty yummy stuff. The rice was a nice bonus but not something I felt I needed."}
{"text":"Super reasonable and very tasty. I had dinner here on Sunday night and can't wait to return. The soup was flavorful with the perfect amount of spice. I ordered the 'vegetarian' option and the jjigae came with a lot of vegetables and a generous portion of tofu. Service was quick - our food came out within 10 minutes of ordering. The decor of this place is definitely no frills, but as long as the food is good, I'm okay with that. There have been a lot of really good reviews on Yelp about this place (reason why I wanted to check it out) so I'll spare you the details.  Good for: Korean, jjigae, cheap eat"}
{"text":"They are specialized in the bubbling spicy broth with silky tofu. If you never had this, you should. They have options for every taste - seafood, pork, vegetarian, whatever. I ordered mine kimchi extra spicy and didn't regret (I'm very macho when it comes to spice!)  The thing arrives to you BOILING, and you're supposed to crack an egg inside of it - the raw egg will cook, and the soup will cool down a bit. Now you're ready to have fun! They will serve you purple pot rice - I've never seen this before, and I can't describe it, but I liked it! - as a side dish, and I looove the brown crispy bottom of the pot rice.   Appetizers were very good, lots of kimchi to make me happy. This place has been chosen as one of my favourites. I'm eager to come back!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite resto for tofu stew. I tried others like buk chang and wasn't a fan. I love their side dishes, the staff is friendly as well. Their soup is so delicious and I usually get it with the beef ribs. Probably one of my top Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Don't hate me for not giving this place more stars, but I have to be honest here. I would come back for the service but now that I've been here three times, I think I have to admit I prefer Buk Chang down the street, mostly because I prefer the bibimbap there.  I'm no Soon tofu expert, but both times I ordered the \"beef\" soon tofu, all I could think was (obligatory outdated pop cultural reference here) \"Where's the beef?\"   Also - I don't really eat pork or eggs, which eliminates a large portion of the menu for me, since most items include these ingredients, although you can request no egg. The Soon tofu broth is okay but it seemed to be missing something. Maybe it needs the egg?  The bibimbap here was good but Buk Chang had more beef in theirs. Bathrooms are passable and the service is good."}
{"text":"Tip:  If you come with a party of 2, during a dinner rush, you may be lucky to score a table.  Otherwise 3+ ppl, you may be screwed and end up waiting, and waiting...  Unlucky for me, there were 3 of us.  Male manager (??) in jeans came to us and said, \"5-10mins!\".  We ended up waiting for approx. 40-45mins.  :(  Looking back, we should've just left as there are numerous options in Koreatown, but we just passed our threshold and we had invested too much to leave after a certain point!  Food was GOOD, not to mention plentiful.  I never understand when other reviewers comment on soontofu portions being \"small\" as there are soo many components:  tofu stew itself, the large-ish bowl of rice, that rice soaked in tea, PLUS all the sides.  Personal Highlights:  tofu/seafood pancake and the thinly sliced, spicy pork that came with a soontofu combo.  Sides were very decent as well.  Kimchi was nicely seasoned with a taste of some kinda fish paste.  I've been to Buk Chang (Mississauga) as well as Chodang and it's difficult to say which 1 was the best!  I know Chodang makes their own tofu, GMO-free, so their broth isn't as in-your-face with flavour.  However, Buk Chang uses mixed purple + white rice, but not sure of their Koreatown location.  Tip #2:  I also saw people taking their soontofu leftovers TO-GO, so you don't hafta stuff yourself!!!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a FOUR! Pork bone soup tasted different compared to other korean restaurants such as wow and owl but in a good way. There's just something about it. Perhaps the spiciness? Who knows. But what really surprised me is their soon tofu soup. I have tried tofu soup before but I was never impressed. However, I decided to try it in this place because it's their specialty. And it is! It went really well with my stone pot rice and the korean pancake was also good. Almost a filipino version of Okoy. Service was prompt and the place was well maintained. I deducted a star because a place this good should be open 24hrs or if not perhaps until 3am? They turned off the flashing \"OPEN\" sign at 09:20 when they close at 10:30... On a Friday night! Need to say more? Ciao!"}
{"text":"A buddy of mine lives near this restaurant so she recommended it without hesitation (you know, among all of the other Korean restaurants on Bloor).  I can't remember what I had exactly, I think it was pork bibimbap, but it was delicious.  We all enjoyed our food very much.  Prompt and friendly service.  Very clean restaurant, too!"}
{"text":"We've been to several similar Korean Restos along the Bloor West strip, but this place is our go-to.  We come here on week nights when we don't feel like cooking. Bubbling hot tofu soup with a pot of healthy grainy rice is perfect for a cold winter's night. Unlike some of the other places, we find that Tofu village seems to have larger portions, more suitable to my North American appetite!!  Long story short - It's quick and cheap and delicious and fresh.... What more can you ask for?  I always leave this place feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Yay, it's my first time at Tofu Village and I'm definitely coming back!  Of course, this restaurant specializes in Soon Tofu so I had to try it out. I ordered the Kimchi Soon Tofu in Medium (+1 for having levels of spiciness).  INTERIOR: OK. Average. Ordinary. Slightly cramped, but that's typical for restaurants in K-town.  SERVICE: It's on par with my expectations--frequent check-ups/rounds to ensure your needs are met. Everyone's really friendly, so +1.  FOOD: First time having Soon Tofu and I thoroughly enjoyed it (: Highly recommend any one of the Soon Tofus as my friends and I all ordered different ones and everyone liked theirs!"}
{"text":"Our go to Korean restaurant. Simple, consistent, good, reliable, inexpensive, comfortable with all the staple dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Best DolSot BibimBob in Toronto!!!! I can't wait to go back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Only thing is when it's  really busy here , the service is very sloppy. It's  slightly understandable but when customers who arrive after you  is served first is kind of weird and annoys me."}
{"text":"This place was a solid soon duboo place! Food was great, prices great, service was nice and the place was clean! We ordered the different soon tofu dishes and the duk-book-ki appetizer.   It all came boiling and nicely spicy.  The banchan was nothing to write home about but they did all the other things right."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot. Simple interior. I really liked the bibimbop and soon tofu combo which is a great and filling way to taste a bit of everything. I repeat it IS very filling especially for one person! I'd go to Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu over here for soon tofu, but I'm a bit of a newbie anyhow. I forget the details, but I recall sour taste from service perspective. Worth a visit for sure!"}
{"text":"To my taste the Soon Tofu wasn't quite as good as at Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/buk-chang-dong-soon-tofu-toronto-2) but it was pretty damn close. My main complaint is that even the \"spicy\" had zero spice.  On the up side, Tofu Village has a more extensive menu compared to Buk Chang including appetizers, some noodle dishes, and your typical meaty Korean favourites like Galbi and Bulgogi. They also have a combo for about $15 which gets you a half size bowl of soup and one of their meat dishes. Of course, this also comes with all the sides and stone bowl rice.  Another plus is that the decor and service is better than Buk Chang and it's a lot less busy."}
{"text":"Very delicious soon tofu dishes! However the highlight of our meal was definitely the seafood tofu pancakes- wow were those crunchy and soft at the same time!! Delicious side dishes and very good service. Excellent prices for the quantity and quality of food."}
{"text":"I used to goto their Kimchi and tofu near Bathurst station, but since they are closed I went to tofu village at Christie station. Still good. Still love their food. Their soon tofu is not too spicy and it taste like they use less msg than their neighbor, buk chang dong soon tofu. soon tofu comes in boiling hot stone pot so be careful. I also ordered chicken hot stone bibimbab.Loved it as always. Portions are generous at reasonable price :)"}
{"text":"i know some yelpers say that tofu village has better sundubu jjigae than buk chang dong. i'm not sure of that myself. like nadal and federer, they're pretty close. it depends on who's having a better day.  however!   tofu village offers dishes that buk chang dong doesn't, like mul-naengmyeon, a must-have in the summer. and the service is definitely friendlier at tofu village.   overall, tofu village is my go-to place for korean in toronto."}
{"text":"- Food: Great - Service: Fantastic & Highly Accommodating - Will Return"}
{"text":"This is the best soon tofu restaurant in Toronto hands down. I've been here many times during lunch and dinner, and it has never disappointed. My favourite is the Pork Soon Tofu (~$9) which comes in a generous portion for the price. Remember to crack the egg in while it's hot! I think they make their tofu in-house, which explains the fresh soy taste. Meatballs are nice and tender, and the broth is very flavourful and balanced. Sometimes I even ask for no spiciness just to enjoy the broth on its own. There's a good variety of side dishes as well, especially tofu ones you won't find at other places.   The staff are quick and friendly, always checking in if you want more side dish refills. Best of all, this place is significantly more spacious and quiet compared to Buk Chang Dong across the street."}
{"text":"Definitely an affordable place. Classic Korean food that focuses on tofu. Tried their house special which had a mix of seafood and abit of beef with plenty of tofu.  The service was fast, although if it's busy they can forget your little request to refill the tea or bun Chan.  Great tasting side dishes, and definitely more tofu as side dishes. There only weird encounter is, when I asked the waitress to keep one of the menu, as I want to order more she said I couldn't as they only had limited menu. Usually restaurants would like it as it only means you would prefer more food.  Also, usually water would be poured into the hot stone bowl which has the rice. And when you finish, you can eat the rice. Maybe i should've asked instead of expecting for it. Nevertheless, it's tasty and affordable Korean meal."}
{"text":"Numerous repeat visits, time for an update.   This place is still AMAZINGLY EPICTASTICLY AWESOME!!  After tonight's meal, Tofu Village is being upgraded to my FAVOURITE place on the Korea Town strip (and I have been to them all, most of them numerous repeat visits unless they really sucked the first time)  Tonight I finally decided I needed to get back on track with my pork bone soup rankings, so I ordered a bowl of the good stuff.   BEST pork bone soup EVER! It was brought out looking like a real culinary dish, not some sloppy fast foody type crap. Good amount of perfectly cooked tender pork bones, 2 potato pieces, tons of cabbage and bean sprouts added. Delicious, (yet not oily) colourful broth, garnished with ground pepper and spring onion.  Tofu Village has been open for 3 months now and it's so popular there is often a queue to get a table at the dinner rush time.  Service is continually impressive, banchan refills are always offered, the decor is as good as it gets (in Korea town), food is cheap. Soon tofu and pork bone soup cannot be topped elsewhere. $6.95. Geez.  Now, if they can pull off a mean dolsot bibimbap (haven't tried it yet) this place will officially be my double rainbow of Korean goodness."}
{"text":"Went here again last night- it's my favourite korean place in the neighbourhood (with an admitted limited knowledge of korean food).   I had the soon tofu and mixed veggie bimbimbap, shared the vegetable and seafood pancakes with my friend, and he had the spicy pork and pork steamed dumplings.   The service here (in my experience) is great, the food is awesome, and it's very inexpensive. I can order just the soon tofu (no meat/seafood) and for $6 have a huge meal with leftovers.   Last night we shared a ton of stuff, ate leisurely, and had a great time.   HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Here is very cheap and still enough all good food for someone is poor at the end of month like me lol.  Around 10$, u can order 1 dish, included 1 soup, 1 rice and some banchan. The soup and rice always very very hot, be careful!  I like the rice here bc they mix it with bean, very healthy. The soup u can order for how much spicy u like, for me is always extra spicy haha.  And they will give u a small egg to put in the soup, it will be more delecious.  They serve food also very fast, so no complain here.  Prepare cash if u pay under 15$."}
{"text":"This is my favourite soon tofu place. Price is decent and their tofu is soft and broth is flavourful too. Their side dishes are great and I like how they give you purple rice. I would also recommend their tofu pancakes too they are delish!  Outside of the soup menu their Kalbi is good and so is their dolsot bimbimbap."}
{"text":"We ordered the spicy pork, beef soon do boo and dolsot vegetable bimbimbap.  The spicy pork didn't have the sweetness I am accustomed and the dolsot bimbimbap had too much rice.  The soon do boo was pretty decent but lacked beef.  The hot pot of rice didn't get that crunchy goodness.  The banchan was decent and the service was friendly and mostly prompt.   The soon do boo was a 3-star for me.  The others were 2 stars.  But I guess if you go to a tofu soup place, that is what you should order.  Thus, I give it the 3 stars for its name."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Toronto. Good service, hearty tofu soups, and delicious ddukboki! We like ordering combos that come with soup and meat. A must try if you're in k-town."}
{"text":"After checking this place out twice I feel like I have tested the waters enough to write a review. Everyone seems to be raving about this place and about how great it is. I don't get it.  Yes the food is cheap and the portions are huge but it's not really that great. Now on both visits I have ordered two different types of Soon Tofu. Both times I have been very disappointed at the lack of meat in the dish. Where's the pork? Oh there it is, just let me pull out my monocle so I can see that one tiny piece that I got in my bowl.  This may be the place for pork bone soup, but it certainly isn't the place for Soon Tofu. Go a couple doors down to Buk Chang, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Tofu Village used to have another location up at Kennedy and Hwy 7.... sadly it was closed and replaced by Nak Won.. So now this Bloor location is the only Tofu Village in GTA..  To tell you frankly, I like Buk Chang a little better.... just a different vibes.. the busiest, the energy and mostly young Korean male wait staffs running around... and help you scoop up the rice and pour water into your hot pot  Tofu Village though has more comfortable, spacious seating.... and most of the wait staffs are female... you have to do your own rice scooping and everything else!  The menu wise, Tofu Village has a more extensive menu not just soon tofu and bimbimbap... that Galbi beef and rice in hot stone pot ($8.95) I ordered was quite delicious but it took FOREVER to come!! don't ever order anything aside from Soon Tofu if you in a hurry!! Thanks Karl for requesting some hot sauce, it did give a kick to my rice!  Kimchi Soon Tofu ($6.95) is A-OK. We requested Spicy..but it is NOT Korean spicy... not like Buk Chang the most spicy version... Maybe if you really want authentic Korean spiciness ask for Extra spicy. The tofu itself was silky and the soup bubbling hot! What better to have at a -20C afternoon!  They accepts Visa and Mastercard for orders over $20.  BTW, I AM IN regardless if my friend ask me to go Tofu Village or Buk Chang... I just love Korean food!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a lot of Korean restaurants before, but I tried this place the other day and it was great. I shared the deep fried dumplings and the beef bulgoki with my husband and it filled us right up. Not bad for only $20. The service was nice and quick, food was tasty, and it was an overall good experience. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Had a good first experience here! I ordered the House Soon Tofu which came with some clams, shrimp and beef. Each tofu dish also comes with a pretty hefty side of purple rice and a raw egg which you can crack into your tofu/soup. They are pretty generous with their side dishes and I believe they gave us 4 different ones.   The service here was excellent! The staff was super friendly and willingly answered the questions my friends and I had about the ingredients in the tofu dishes, the level of spiciness, etc. They were also super attentive and came around at the right times to check if we were okay to order but weren't pushy. Food came pretty soon after we ordered as well, so service was prompt! Also, since my friend and I expressed our concern about the spiciness of the mild soup, our waitress was kind enough to ask the chef to add a little less for us. I really appreciated the gesture! A+  I could even give this place a 5, but for me the tofu didn't blow me away. It was a delicious and super filling meal for a good price (less than $8 before tax and tip) , but I'm not an experienced enough tofu eater to recognize fantastic tofu when I have it. I would definitely come back again though to try their other non-tofu dishes, and would recommend this place to Korean food lovers or tofu lovers."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I don't understand why people go to buk Chang dong cuz this place is so much better with a lot more to offer  Food: we got the bulgogi and kalbi combination dinners.. Huge portions.. Not sure why people complain about the size of the soon tofu cuz it's the perfect size considering you're getting a full dinner on top of everything.. This is coming from someone who loves to stuff their face like a man.. My Korean boyfriend said that the soon tofu was really good and authentic.. He never orders kalbi cuz his mom makes the best one, but he tried mine and said that it was close to his mom's cooking.. Bulgogi was also perfectly seasoned and cooked.. They also serve their soju ice cold.. Delicious  Service: pretty good.. They gave us an extra table so we'd have more room, unlike buk Chang dong where they took our other table making our one table super cramped.. But they weren't very attentive  Ambiance: it was lacking,but food quality, portion and price ($45 for 2 combination dinners and soju) more than made up for it.. Definitely my go place restaurant in ktown"}
{"text":"Tofu Village is the best one on the Bloor strip. Great side dishes, friendly service, good for meat eaters and vegetarians. Bibimbap is awesome, as are the glass noodles, and kimchi pancake. Dumplings are meh, skip them."}
{"text":"I LOVE sundubu jigae. And this place did not let me down whatsoever true to its name. The broth was amazing; spicy and super flavorful and the selections of banchans were pretty plenty in my opinion. It really does make a difference in the meal experience when you get your rice in a stone pot so the rice crisps out. My friend and I ordered japchae also and it was tasty but greasy in sesame oil. Regardless our meal was nothing short of amazing. I wish I could move this place to where I live. If I'm ever back in Toronto this is my number one stop!"}
{"text":"Hooray my first meal in Toronto!!!    I was walking from my apartment to work on Family Day to get a feel for the neighborhood.  It looked clean from the outside and was relatively empty.  I came in, ordered galbi and a coke.  By the time my soda arrived the restaurant was packed and full of filipinos!  SCORE!  The galbi was the most tender galbi I have ever had in my life. Not too greasy, not too grilled.  Just perfect.  Great portion for about $9.    Credit cards for $20 and over only...   Great place to eat alone and people watch.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Is tofu village accepting any new citizens?  Because I want to live there.  I ordered the house special soon tofu and quite honestly it was the best one I have ever had.  IN MY LIFE.  The tofu was so silky smooth you could've told me that it was made from butter and I would believe you.  I ordered mine medium spicy, and it was just right.  The broth was very flavourful, with just the right amount of seafood umami.  Came boiling hot in an iron bowl, with a stone bowl of purple rice (with its own wooden stand!?  Which was appropriate, because that shit should be on a pedestal.) and tons of little plates of Kim Chee (forget the name of those little dishes of pickled/preserved veggies!).  Staff were also really friendly and quick and did not push us out of the restaurant when we were done, and we sat there for a good three hours!  (sorry, inhabitants of Tofu Village.)  Also: prices were so good!  $8.85 for soon tofu is unprecedented!  I will return for sure."}
{"text":"The food was good. If you order soon tofu, the rice comes  in a hot bowl, which is not common in other korean restaurant.  service was not as great... but as I only stay for 20 mins for the food, I wouldn't worry about the services."}
{"text":"The combination of soon tofu and bulgogi is my usual go to. It's filling and will definitely keep you warm during a toronto Winter. One piece of advice, get everything but the kimchi fried rice. #TrustMe #YourWelcome"}
{"text":"Food: 5/5, best tofu stew Service: 4/5, extremely friendly staff, but I felt sometimes got too busy and under-staffed Price: $15 per person My Favourite: House Speical Tofu stew  Been here many times with co-workers and friends, and never disappointed. I love the tofu stew here, not too salty, but spicy and just got the right amount of favours. There are so many restaurants in Korean town, this place is authentic and good. The rice is purple-ish and came in a hot stone. This places got a lot of side dishes."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, and excellent food.   The staff will continuously ask if you want refills on the banchan. I'm a big fan of the sweet soy beans, and the spicy tofu!  The price is also very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favourite place for Korean food.  My go to dishes are Kalbi beef and house soon tofu.  The owner is very personable."}
{"text":"Amazing soondobu here! This place really lives up to its reputation and serves some really good quality tofu - both in the stew and even in the side dishes. For the stew, I always get the seafood soondobu - it's super satisfying and is just what I need on a cold day. It has lots of tofu and the seafood (shrimp, mussels) really adds a good taste to the broth. Sometimes when I'm super hungry, I would get the soondobu and bulgogi combo - the soondobu bowl in this combo is smaller than the regular bowl though.   The side dishes are also great. They serve cut pieces of tofu which I always ask for refills of because it's so good. The bean sprouts and the marinated(?) bean sprouts (they almost look like nuts) are super addicting. The kimchi is also really great here. The side dishes overall are very yummy even though you don't get much variety (usually 3-4 dishes), but you can ask for refills.   Definitely check this place out. One of my favs for sure."}
