{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for years and have always loved the food. Cheap prices, huge portions, and friendly service! Parking is right next to the building, I've gone to pick up food at various hours and have never felt as if I was in any danger. They also recently started to accept credit cards so I don't always have to carry cash."}
{"text":"Been going here since a kid,  all started when my grandfather used to get us takeout from here after he'd take us to the cheap movie theater that used to be next door.   (The liquor store that the other reviewer mentioned is no longer in business and it is a safe area)   Always greeted with a smile,  the owners are some of the nicest people you will encounter and have been here for over 25 yrs. (feels good getting food from folks who appreciate your business)   This is not a dine in restaurant (take out only)  China Lu makes affordable food that is very tasty and gives you enough for the next day, I usually get the Moo Goo Gai Pan and Lo mein.  Give em a Try!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to place for Chinese. Great specials, GIGANTIC portions and my favorite 'cheap chinese take-out' wonton soup in Cleveland.   However, ever since the addition of the liquor store in the old Hollywood Video, I don't order from here anymore. Literally, two guys got into a fight right outside and threatened to shoot each other. They were arguing over a 40. Another time a guy got into an insane argument with the a person working there. Like, yelling racial slurs and being belligerent in general.  If the place delivered, I'd totally order from them again. But the area is just a little too shady to do take-out.  [Before anyone calls me out for being a suburban kid who overreacts. I've lived in areas of Chicago more dangerous than this (West Rogers Park, bad parts of Edgewater) and haven't encountered the same thing.]"}
