{"text":"Unlike most places in Phoenix, prime rib is a safe bet at Carvers. The salads and sides are delicious. The steaks are flavorful as well. 

A little pricey for what you get, considering the quality of the meat is on par with a lot of chain restaurants. But, to be honest, sometimes you just don't want to deal with bright neon Texas signs or the adjective \"Bloomin\" attached to menu items."}
{"text":"Been closed for at this location forever ...contacted by management and they have a new place  83rd ave and Thunderbird."}
{"text":"I have eaten here with my boyfriend twice now (gift card from mom...what!) and both times have been superb.  What really impressed me was the great service and attention to detail.  

Now, this is not a swanky hip place to take your girlfriends but it is a solid choice when you are looking for a delicious steak or wonderful chops.  Intimate tables and dim (maybe a little too dim) lighting make for a nice evening.   But with all the choices on 83rd, I can see how Carvers can easily be overlooked by the younger crowd.  In both instances, we were by far the youngest diners in the place..."}
{"text":"So I wanted to go out for some prime rib the other night.  I got on yelp to find some prime rib reviews in the area and came across carvers.  The picture on yelp of the french onion soup sold me on the place as a worth trying kind of place. 

The wife and I headed out early for dinner about 5:00pm we were seated promptly since the dinner cowed hadn't really shown up yet.  we sat down on a corner booth and the waitress took our drink order.  the water was cold and refreshing. :) hey were on a recession budget so we pass on the costly refreshments. 

The waitress brought us out some sour dough rolls to start and took our orders.  My wife and I both ordered a french onion soup to start and it was AWESOME.  It has a mound of these thin sliced battered onions on top and a lawyer of melted cheese, bread and yummy broth.  It was gooy.  It was however big enough to share so next time we will just order one.

I ordered the carvers double cut herb crusted prime rib with garlic mash and my wife got the new york strip with au-gratin potatoes.  The prime rib was very tasty and had a nice herb crust on it.  The garlic mash was a little on the thin side.  Maybe to much cutter of cream. they just didn't stand up like a good mash potato should.  My wife only had about half of her streak as there was a vain running through it and that pretty much ended it for her.  her potato's held together much better because of the cheese but the flavor just wasn't the greatest.

Over all we enjoyed out time here and the food was ok."}
{"text":"Disappointing to be sure.  I should have checked the most recent reviews here before stopping in with my grandma.  We had french onion soup and it was so salty, BOTH orders went back.  It was one of three times I've ever seen my grandma send anything back.  I was really in the mood to enjoy some top-shelf vodka that day, but I wasn't going to be doing it here.  For a place in this price range not to have anything even remotely close to top-shelf is offensive.  Save your time people who are going to email me about how wonderful Grey Goose is.  Instead of sending me an email I'm not going to read, do some research on vodka and educate yourself.  Then and only then will you know what I'm talking about.

Back to Carvers.  I would look elsewhere for an \"special occasion\" place.  Food is overpriced for what it is, service is slow at best, and alcohol selection is on par with Red Robin."}
{"text":"Had a craving for MEAT!!!!  AARRRGGGHHH...

Nice place, attentive service and good food....one of our steaks was sent back because it was cold....but other than that we had a good meal here 

BEEF! It's what's for dinner"}
{"text":"When the occasion calls for an extra special dinner, such as Mother's or Father's Day, or even a birthday, I would suggest Glendale Carvers Steak & Chops, 8172 W. Bell Road, (in front of Best Buy) Glendale, 623-412-0787. Prime rib is the house specialty but they have an extensive and impressive menu. Prices range from $20-$30.

The ambiance is relaxed upscale with plenty of private rooms for those special intimate parties. 

To start we nibbled on the Calamari Fritti, lightly fried with sweet red peppers and onion drizzled with ancho chili mayonnaise $9.95. Yummy. Just the right taste to set the appetite on fire.  A companion had the French Onion Soup au Gratin $5.00 which I sampled and enjoyed the deep rich flavor without being salty as many onion soups can be. 

 I especially enjoyed the Filet Mignon Carver's Cut $26, their most tender cut, with Sherried Mushrooms $5.00. The Filet is served with salad and potato. From the wide range of choices I selected the spinach salad with honey mustard dressing that was to die for delicious.  You have your choice of garlic, au gratin, baked or French fries for the potato. I took the baked loaded and it was perfection. They also offer rice pilaf or vegetables. 

My friend had the Prime Rib Carver's Cut $29. They say it is award winning finest Midwestern beef with a herb crusted slow roasted overnight to ensure the most tender prime rib available. It is wonderful, tender and juicy as it should be. 

Another friend felt her whiskey peppercorn steak  was smothered with too greasy a sauce. And it was tough.  I have never personally had a bad cut at Carver's. I told her to send it back, but she wouldn't and was happy with her potato and salad. 

Dessert was the Chocolate Oblivion $6.00 which I hope left me oblivious to the calories. It was enough to share with my dining partner leaving us both satisfied. Coffee to keep me awake after this delicious meal. 

I should mention we finished off three bottles of wine between the five of us. A nice list to choose from and our waiter was very good at making recommendations. Their list allows by the glass or bottle and plenty of general wine information. You can view the list online prior to your visit to expedite selections. 

They also offer chicken and seafood which I may try on another visit... haw.. the steaks are too good!  I would highly recommend Carver's in Glendale to anyone looking for a fine dining experience. The service was exceptional and the food perfection."}
{"text":"Yes, I am not kidding you, this place dropped all the way to last place.

I heard that they are getting new management after the first of the year...lets hope that is true.  Because the HORRIBLE food that we received, I have no idea how this place will stay in business.  (Though, it looked like the place was crawling with Sun City folk- no disrespect of course, since I was there will my grandparents and their friends.)

Their vodka selection was slim.  My French Onion soup was disgusting.  My filet Oscar was DRENCHED in Bearnaise sauce...so much so I couldn't even eat it.  And because I was with my grandfather, he wouldn't let me take it back.  (Must be an old school thing.)  Nothing was cooked right (my grandmother and her friend disliked their salmon....though later on my grandmother said the food was so good there she can't wait for New Years...long story)

I mentioned that we should have went to Flemings...but nobody listened."}
{"text":"This restaurant is no longer located on Bell Road. It is at 83rd Ave. and Thunderbird on the NE corner. It is no longer the fine dining restaurant that once was on Bell Road. We had a 6:30pm reservation for Valentines Dinner 2011. We arrived 5 minutes early and we were told there were several other people ahead of us. We waited in the lobby and we were seated in about 15 minutes. Our waiter David R. started out OK,  but as the evening progressed, the service went down hill. I ordered a chocolate martini as I have in the past there and it was completely different. They used to be excellent. This came with what looked like Hershey syrup coating the glass and it had milk in it. It tasted like vodka with milk, no chocolate flavor. It was very strong, though. The Cesar salad and the romaine salad were quite good, just like they used to be. My husband and I both ordered the smaller fillet mignon steaks cooked medium. When they arrived and we cut into them, mine was medium rare and my husband's was medium well. You could clearly see the difference in the 2 steaks. You would think no problem, just tell the waiter. Well, he never came back to check on us or ask if our steaks were OK. So we proceeded to eat them. When we were finally able to get his attention and tell him, he apologized and offered to bring us prime rib. I don't even care for prime rib. We asked for more rolls. Oh, by the way, they no longer serve the delicious, warm,  brown loaf of bread. They now serve little white rolls which look like you can buy them at Fry's. They are OK. He forgot to bring them and when I asked for a to-go box,  I gently reminded him. He proceeded to bring me a box of rolls to go? We asked for our check, paid and left. On a side note, the couple at the table behind us were seated shortly after us. We heard them complaining to our waiter that they had been waiting 15 minutes and no one had approached them or brought them water or menus.  Apparently,  they had been seated at a table that had not been assigned to any wait staff. So, no one bothered to help them. Instead of a manager coming over to them to apologize, they sent the hostess over to explain. How tacky. We also witnessed a man at another table sending back his food. The martinis were $8, our 2 steaks were $52,  for a total bill of $72.00 before tax.  One of the worst, most expensive meals we've had in a long time. And on Valentine's Day to boot. We were seated directly across from the kitchen door so you know what that was like. The previous location was warm, cozy and romantic. This place has no style to speak of and I hated the cement floors and exposed vent system in the ceiling.
Needless to say, we won't return ever. I do not recommend this restaurant for any occasion."}
