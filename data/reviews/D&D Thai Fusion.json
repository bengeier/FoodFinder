{"text":"Had a vegetarian rice dish here:  tofu and eggplant.
It was a long wait during lunchtime on a weekday, 15-20 minutes, but it was one of the best if not the best fried eggplant tofu dish I had.   Big chunks of tofu and eggplant cooked well & tasty.  Will go back to try other items but will budget time for the wait.

Saw others before me getting the noodle soups."}
{"text":"Worst food ever! Ordered the Tuesday special for $7.95 plus tax, Singapore fried noodle.  Portion were tiny.  Food was disgustingly SALTY.  There were a lot of low grade shrimps that were extremely salty.  I have never tasted anything so salty before.  I'm not sure what's with the 4stars review.  It's actually worth ZERO star!"}
{"text":"Felt like eating a good soup noodle this evening and I ended up here, ordering the Chicken Laksa. After tax, it came to be $10 flat. Also got a free Tom Yum soup with yelp check-in! The laksa comes as a rich coconut curry broth with the perfect bit of spiciness. In it, you'll find thin egg noodles, deep fried tofu cubes, your choice of chicken/beef/shrimp/veggies, and topped off with a handful of crunchy deep fried egg noodles. The chicken was plentiful, thinly sliced, and quite juicy. The tofu cubes tasted like they're freshly fried in-house! But then the crispiness goes to die in the soup. This came as a surprise to me when I bit into it expecting a soft tofu puff (like the kind used in hot pot) but upon biting into it, I found little sections of crispiness left from its once crispy fried exterior. Overall, a great experience! I need to come back to try the thai iced milk tea next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  I like my pad Thai dry and this was flavourful, light and not oily.  Everything was cooked to order and packed carefully for take out.  Will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Delicious food court food located at the Shoppes of The Parkway in Richmond Hill (Hwy7/Leslie).  

Prices are decent, and seems to be good quality.  They have a small but nice selection of chinese/thai/breakfast/snack dishes.

I try something new each time, but I miss the fish soup noodle from before.  I thought it was better than the current style."}
{"text":"I admit it. I came here by accident; originally I meant to eat at Thai 8 Cafe, but I forgot the name of the stall as I was walking into the Shoppes. Since I came from the Highway 7 entrance and walked around to the food court, I missed the Thai 8 Cafe sign until after I ordered from here.

Shouldn't be that bad, right? I ordered the \"famous\" pad thai. For $6.50 including tax and drink, it was definitely a sweet deal, and I honestly didn't expect much from it...aside from the fact it took over 20 minutes for the food to be ready.

Obviously it was nowhere near the best pad thai I've had, but for $6.50 it was good. The quantity was definitely there, and I doubt you would be able to finish it for lunch unless you're extremely hungry. The noodles, however, were on the soggy side, and I found the lemon flavour to be too strong. If you're literally broke and can't afford a $8 pad thai, this place would suffice for you.

Next time I'll choose the actual correct Thai food stall."}
{"text":"Great value for the $$ spent! 

A place hidden in a food court of Sheraton Parkway Hotel in Richmond Hill...it's unfortunate, I think I'd go there more often if they have a little dine-in place.

This place has many good items on the menu, my favourite would be the fish noodles in soup...don't forget to ask for their house blend spicy sauce!! It is addictive!

I have also tried other menu items such as, their spicy fish + vermicelli stir fry...another good item as well!

As Asian cooking can be a little oily, you can always ask for less oil/salt/additional spice etc.

I can't be biased, as much as I love all item(s) that I've tried...the pro and con about this place is that, it's made in front of you...meaning, if there's a line-up, then you'd have to wait... but I think it's totally worth it! Yup, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Located in the food court in 'the shoppes of parkway' right behind Esso. 
Great portions, Less than $20 feed 2 adult and more. 
Taste very good!
Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love their fish soup noodle.  Place is clean. Don't forget to check in to get your free Tom yum soup!"}
