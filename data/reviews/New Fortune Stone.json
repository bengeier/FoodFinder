{"text":"New owner since 2012 winter. They have introduced more variety of dishes than before. Always crowded."}
{"text":"Great food and Service !same as Hong Kong style fast food restaurant , lot of different variety! HK milk tea is great !"}
{"text":"All time favorite!  I come here almost every week for five years now.  Everything taste good with affordable price!  I especially love Their mixed grill hot plate, pork chop bun and stir fry satay beef n chow mein!  Live their hk style milk tea n love love love their lemon tea! !!!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty and inexpensive Chinese caf√©. Somewhat tiny, but the portions and what they offer are substantial. Huge menu  with single plate type offerings, so many choices. The Sichuan beef brisket on rice and the beef tongue on noodles were both so tasty and they include included tea, soup and drink. Tax and tip for two $18! Nothing gastronomically outstanding, just hearty, wholesome cuisine. Definitely returning! Value makes this worthy of 5 stars, otherwise a 4star"}
{"text":"Great place for quick meal good price for its food. Very friendly owner and staff, convenience location. Recommend those special meal that is listed on the wall."}
{"text":"Went here with my family and they were very accommodating for my kid siblings. Typical Hong Kong cafe style restaurant but they do have some substantial meals like steak and chicken wings. It's a really great place to grab a cheap snack or meal. Love their combos, the value here is great as their portions are a good size."}
{"text":"Just happened to drop by this place as we didn't want to go to far as it was raining.  New Fortune is pretty small around 7-8 tables.  Place looks decent, nothing that stands out to you.  Got the soup noodles which comes with toast and 2 eggs and a drink or $4.95.  Not bad at all.  Also got the deep fried ice cream for $3.50 (including a drink as well)."}
{"text":"I was looking for a Hong Kong style set dinner (cha chaan teng) and arrived here on a friend's reccomendation. The place is tiny but probably gets quite busy during peak hours. At 5pm on a Monday there was no shortage of customers.  The prices were really great, you can get a large meal or afternoon snack for cheap. (But I wouldn't recommend the chicken wings...they were absolutely miniscule.) I ordered grilled black pepper beef spaghetti with garlic sauce which arrived on a sizzling plate with a load of broccoli and carrots on the side. It also came with corn soup, a warm bun, a small dessert and soy milk. And if you know what cha chaan teng is, then you know most of these accompaniments can be substituted for other things. It's the food version of Choose-Your-Own-Adventure.   All of this was only $12.99 and because I ended up taking half my entree home, technically you could say the meal was $6.50  :D  Overall, the food was pretty good, the portions were big and you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Definitely above average for cafe standards Most items come with a soup and drink... the milk tea was also good  It's a really small place. Just a few tables Service is friendly by cafe standards  Same plaza as a T&T. It's busy, but theres quite a bit of parking CASH ONLY  Will be back"}
{"text":"They serve pretty decent Chinese HK style food and everything comes in a relatively timely manner. The only thing is that space is fairly cramped and the service is always hit or miss (servers can be sort of inattentive/rude depending on the day and how busy they are - and I know, the restaurant business is tough, but it is sort of disheartening to experience)."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me, and I was curious enough to try it out when we went on a Gong Cha run.  I had the baked fish fillet with cream corn. You have the option of having it with spaghetti or rice, and I opted for spaghetti (which is my preference for any baked dish at an HK-style cafe). My friend had a meatier version with pork, beef and mushroom sauce. The service was quick and to the point, but beware if you can't speak Cantonese as the servers aren't too fluent in English. The menu is in English, however, so you can make do with pointing at the dish you want from the menu and saying key words like 'bill', but don't expect much more than that. The food was great half way through and the portions were good. However, the food isn't exactly on the light side, so I felt a little overwhelmed with the heavy sauce and fatty slices of fish after that. Please ensure you have a lot of room or have a high tolerance for fattening foods! Also, the dishes come with a cream soup and a drink for an extra dollar. For most, it's a great deal, but the cream soup has chicken bits, so beware vegetarians.  Most clients ordered iced tea as their drink, which surprised me because  HK milk tea has always been the holy grail of HK-style cafes in my opinion. My friend ordered the said milk tea and I ordered coffee for that morning caffeine rush. His milk tea came almost instantly, but my coffee arrived only after I reminded the servers three times - yeah, my two cents is to stick with the milk tea or iced tea if you need a beverage immediately... Overall, this is your typical HK-style cafe with minimal service and heavy, high-calorie dishes. If you're looking for some cheap eats that isn't McDonald's, then it's worth a shot. I wouldn't see myself going out of my way to come here though because it's the same as other HK-style cafes in my backyard of Scarborough."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly small! It think there are only 10 tables. This place gets quite busy during dinner time.  My boyfriend ordered noodle soup for $6.50. Serving is decent. Taste is a-ok. Not salty at all.  Same goes for the sandwich I ordered. I ordered the corned beef and egg sandwich for $3.50. It is pretty bland, but you get a big sandwich for what you pay. Prices are really cheap.  It was worth a try, but I don't think I am coming back again. Nothing too special about this place."}
{"text":"Came today for lunch. Tiny little place. Some tables are quite close together. Very little space to wait inside. We did have to wait for about 10 minutes. Our party ended up being seated in a booth with an extra two person table pushed together with it.   I had the fortune stone special chicken with rice ($8.25). According to my receipt, it was chicken with sweet soy sauce. It came with soup and a drink. Soy milk was an option, so I got that one. I got mine cold. We wondered whether I'd get an upcharge that usually comes with making drinks cold. Didn't end up paying that charge, which was nice. Had the Russian borscht as my soup option. Uneven boels. Quirky. Other than that, fairly standard soup. Chicken was juicy. Rice was a tad dry. The few really long pieces of veggie added a nice bit of color as well as veggie content. Sauce was almost like a seafood soy sauce, so slightly sweet, and had sauteed onions and garlic in it, as well as a layer of oil. Tasty with everything else on the plate.  Not bad food, but the prices are a tad higher than I'd expect from a place like this.  Logos note: debit accepted and they're willing to separate bills."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????ok???"}
{"text":"It's a very small cafe in the same plaza as TNT supermarket . We went there to eat breakfast and I like their breakfast special . I have the ham and macaroni with butter toast and a warm soy milk . It was a good combination .  Also , you get a free Sing Tao newspaper too . :)"}
{"text":"Good baked rices that come in combos with milk tea. Very small resto, not many seats. Solid option for HK style cafe, not an overwhelming selection of options."}
{"text":"Probably one of your typical HK style cafe with all the same stuff. This place is fairly cramped and small so if you have a big group, might have to wait awhile if its busy and they usually are. The ambience is casual and loud when it's busy but if you go during downtown, it's quite relaxing with a cup of milk tea.   The presentation of the food is pretty mouth watering and portions are good as well. As for the quality of the food, it's average, nothing special but would have you returning because it's safe for your mediocre taste buds and cravings when you're extremely hungry.   Though one huge turn off was that the chicken had a really bad taste to it. couldn't eat it at all... but the noodle was good, the milk tea was average and amount of seasoning was appropriate. Their rice dishes are honestly worth it though. The portions of the meat is gorgeous and you will definitely leave feeling like you're 2 months pregnant."}
{"text":"4.5  I have Yelp to thank for being able to find this hiddne gem.  New Fortune Stone is a great little HK style cafe that I will certainly be coming back to.  Pros: Expansive menu Great Staff Food is above average for HK style cafe standards  Cons: Place is on the tiny side  New Fortune Stone is tucked away in the same plaza as the T and T supermarket that you will never find if you don't know about it.  Like I said, if I wasn't browsing around on Yelp, I would of never found this place.  When you walk in, the place has a old school diner feel to it.  The decor is very well done and it feels very homely to me.  I can tell from the conversations customers have with staff that they have many regulars who frequent the place.  The place is fairly small so it will be busy during peak hours.    Opening up the menu, I see that they offer a lot of items here.  Everything you usually find at HK style cafes you will find here and them some.  There are many daily specials to be had here as well.  The prices here are very decent and most items include a soup and a drink.  They actually has so many items that I had a hard time deciding what to order.  I ordered the baked chicken in cream sauce and my GF ordered the fish in spinach and mushroom sauce of rice. The soup comes out immediately after you order and the food not long after.  My baked rice was very well done.  The portions were good and there mushrooms included which I love.  My GF's rice was a little on the salty side but good nonetheless.  If I was eating it I would of liked more rice but for her it was perfect.    What really stands out about this place is the staff.  This is a place where everyone does know your name.  The staff are super friendly here.  Overhearing the conversations the staff have with the regulars really lets you know they love coming here.  It's like one big family here if you ask me.  It's a great atmosphere to have a meal at. Out little one had a little spill at the end of our meal and they cleaned it up without so much a smirk.  I can't wait to be a regular here!      If you love HK style cafes, you need to give this place a try.  Above average food, great prices and awesome staff.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Food is so so. Service is bad! Their HK style milk tea with condense milk ??is totally 'their own style' but not what it is!! ?'?' actually means milk tea without sugar but to add sweetened condensed milk instead. I've order one and server told me there's addition 50cents which is fine. When it comes, sweetened condensed milk is separate serve but the tea (without milk at all) is in the cup. I was surprised but I tried the tea. It's black tea. I've asked the server why they serve in that way, she told me this is the original HK style. And when I add the sweetened condensed milk, there's milk flasks until u stirred for a while. First of all, I think they don't know what is ??. She told me theirs are the original style and I'm wrong! Then I suspected the freshness of milk. I asked to change a coffee for me instead. When I checked the bill, I asked why they still charge me 50cents and the server told me they already given me a free coffee and I need to pay for the ??which they have taken it away. This is ridiculous and I won't go there again!"}
{"text":"The owners are quite a hard working bunch :) This small local business opens 7 days a week... hardly ever closes, even during holidays! Service is always quick, meals literally come out in seconds - I can definitely count of them when I'm starving!! Waitresses there are always friendly and courteous - they love a good chat ;)  I enjoy their hearty breakfast specials, reasonably priced and gets you full for $3.99 with a hot beverage :) I always get their scrambled eggs w/ corn beef sandwich or tuna salad sandwich - all made with 3 slices of bread (be sure you tell them to toast your sandwich!)  They also offer great lunch and dinner specials - different everyday. Comes with: - Sweet bread with butter (served hot, dinner service only) - Soup (Cream soup or Russian Borscht Soup) - Hot beverage (can add $$ for a cold one) - Dessert... mostly mango sago, coconut pudding, etc. (dinner service only)  I'd say their food is pretty delicious... but I find that they don't give enough sauce. Maybe I'm just obsessed with sauce? lol. But you can always ask them for more =p  Overall, I enjoy eating there! You can get your money's worth... it is not expensive at all :) They also offer party trays from appetizers to main courses like fried rice, noodles, and curry beef briskets #yum! You name it, they can probably make it :)  P.S. Parking can be a pain (depending on the hour) because you're trying to fight over spots with people going to T&T Supermarket, and all the eateries in this plaza. They seriously need a bigger parking lot =\"}
{"text":"New Fortune Stone is practically in the same plaza as T&T but being in an awkward location as their storefront is not really visible when you driving along Steeles, I never realized it exist until I read Cherrie T review!  Typical Hong Kong Style Cafe with a huge selection on their menu and offers Breakfast, Lunch, Afternoon and Dinner Special.  Baked Beef with Portuguese Sauce ($7.50) lunch set comes with soup and drink was really good. Portion is huge and enough for me to pack half to go for snack later!  Everyone here is so friendly and treat me like a regular even it was the first time I ever set food in this restaurant!   Definitely worth coming here for a quick cheap HK fast food fix!"}
