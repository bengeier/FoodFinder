{"text":"This place needs some customer service, they don't know what they are doing. The pizza is not great and the way they handle food is poor. I will not go back again"}
{"text":"If you decide to come to WOW Wing, I definitely recommend the \"Markham Special\". I can't remember but you either get 1 or 1.5lb of wings with a side of their special chilli onion fries for $17 (the fries make this worth it).    Wow Wing is a really small, Tamil family run joint in the New Delhi plaza on Markham Rd. If you're with a large group of friends it would probably be better to grab your food and go but sitting down with a group of 4 is not impossible.   There are so many different flavours to try and if you're a fan of spiciness, this place will definitely appeal to you. I tried the the honey garlic and some of what my friend had (forgot his flavour, but it was spicy), and they were both delicious.   Have a go if you're looking for a new wings place to try and try not to burn yourself on the way out! Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"I purchased the single deal for $13.95. It included one pound of wings (around 10), fries, and a drink. Unfortunately the wings were not that good. The wings itself are unsalted and bland. The meat was tasteless but the skin was mildly spicy. The fries were alright. Would I come back here again? No."}
{"text":"This place is great. The service is really good, and the food is tasty. There's something unique about the wings, tastes better than wild wings to me. My favourite is the honey Parm, it's the perfect combination of honey garlic and gar par. The fries here are sooooo good! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best wing places in town. Forget about buffalo wild wing or wild wings. This place is the real deal. There're literally hundreds of flavours you can choose from. It's our favourite takeout place.   Only down side? Frozen fries. I wish the owner realizes that fries make a difference when it comes to pub food."}
{"text":"Amazing wings- with countless flavour options. Spicy/not spicy, dry/saucy you can get whatever you want. Way tastier and more reasonably priced than wild wings. If you're looking for a side- try the Chilli onion fries its amazing!!  Best while hot, and the name says it all its fries with onions and green chillies in this tasty white sauce. The combo totally works!   there's not much of a seating area although they have a table or two. I call ahead and pick up my order and it's always ready.  Good wings, great food, good deals on Mondays!  I haven't tried the pizza but they have that too!  Be warned the 'knockout garlic is way too spicy but that's a challenge."}
{"text":"5 stars, 100%. Great take out place for wings, limited seating (no atmosphere), just grab and go.  I got the Markham Special: 1lb of wings, chilli onion fries and a pop. Have to say, for a wing joint - this place is good.   I ordered the spicy garlic parm, was a little worried it would be too bland at two chilli heat, but was pleasantly surprised by the kick. Perfect for me. I could take hotter, but this was the perfect flavour/spice level.   The chilli onion fries are a must. As my husband so lovingly said \"watch out supreme fries you have a contender\". With small bits of green chilli, some chilli powder, a healthy serving of red onions and garlic sauce, all over crispy fries, this is delicious. Definitely well done and a must order."}
{"text":"Highly recommend, the food is delicious, with a pinch of south Asian flavour!  Particularly love the chili fries!"}
{"text":"This is great for those that like Indian style spicy wings! They have a ton of wing flavours, but the chilly fries are definitely my favourite!"}
{"text":"We all know the feeling. It's a Friday night after a long week. You're out with some buddies, looking to relax, but you've got an itch that you need to scratch; the wing itch. In comes Wow Wing House.  Wow Wing House is a franchise that sells pizza, wraps, sandwiches, quesadillas, and you guessed it, wings. But let's get real. Don't be a chump. You're here for wings and not the other distractions. The New Delhi Drive location has a small interior, with some seating if you'd actually like to sit down for your meal with a small number of people. The thought though is obviously for you to pick up your order, or get takeout.  When it comes to ordering your wings, things get a little overwhelming. Wow Wing House claims that they have over 123 different flavours. (Why over 123 and not 120? God knows...) So if you're one to love having plenty of choice, you'll have a field day ordering. Excuse me for forgetting the atypical flavours that I ordered, but I can say that they were quite satisfying, well cooked, and appropriately spiced according to their rating. These wings don't necessarily entice thoughts of the best wings you've had, but they get the job done well. Along with the wings I had fresh green chilli & onion fries. I ordered these purely out of a gut feeling, because who can resist fries topped with chilli, roasted garlic, red onion, and three ooey gooey cheeses. And of course I was right. They were pretty good. On the other hand, the meal lost points since after finishing the fries, my body promptly and confidently let me know that it did not approve of my dietary decisions.   After having Wow Wing House twice, I'll settle on that I'm happy with what they offer, but for myself, I'll be going sparingly. I have a feeling other people would enjoy what they offer quite a bit."}
{"text":"Gotta say one of my favourite places to go for wings now. They also just opened a new location in Scarborough right on Brimley road. Typically order either the suicide digger or devil's ranch but both are amazing. Taste of Jaffna is also really delicious albeit you really  have to like spicy food to enjoy it.   The wings are decent size and the combo with the spicy onion fries are a must. Not many wing joints are known for their fries but wow wings got some fries that are just as good as the wings. Price is reasonable, it's about 30 bucks for two people. But for the taste of their wings I think it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"First thing first: this review is for the Ajax location ONLY, other Wow Wings are very nice places.  Reasons why this is a terrible restaurant: -Their menu is actually just a PHOTOCOPY of Whitby's menu, with a strip of paper with Ajax's phone number placed crookedly on top. Aside from the incredibly poor quality (things are cut off everywhere), they don't even offer all the items! I tried ordering nachos for example, but they just don't do them.  -They answer the phone with \"Hello?\", and don't try to properly take your order at all. After asking for the single deal combo, they just said \"OK\"... So I had to go through telling them the flavors I wanted, type of pop etc. -When we went to pick up the order, they didn't know it came with coleslaw... Even though it's listed clearly with the combo I ordered. Waited around for them to grab that, which ended up being about 2 fork fulls of slaw. -The wings themselves are pretty good, I'll hand then that, but I made the horrible mistake of trying Gar Par fries. You know that terrible texture/taste fries get when you microwave them? Yeah.... They absolutely microwaved them. Almost inedible if it weren't for the sauce on top.  -Not that I've stayed to eat there, but it's a wing joint that's not even licensed! Other Wow Wings are, and operate much like a Wild Wings. Not this place, it's just super sketchy hole-in-the-wall kind of place.  Seriously, save yourself the disappointment - go to Magwyer's or the Portly Piper nearby instead - they're both amazing."}
{"text":"I came here for the markham special (1lbs wings and their chili onion fries; diced red onions, green chili, and garlic sauce)  It didn't feel so much like a special @ $14.99. The wings were your typical breaded deep fried kind. They were kinda salty and over saturated. The fries were crispy and spicy with all dem onions and green chilies. I liked that garlic white sauce. They need to add ground beef as an option. Overall I wouldn't mind having the fries again, but they need to do something about their wings."}
{"text":"They have tons of wing flavours, so I opted for the one that sounded like the flavour I get everywhere - Spicy Garlic Parm. Pretty good but nothing compares to Nero's Epilogue from All Stars. However, I am ADDICTED to Wow Wings' chili onion fries! First of all, I don't even like onions, but these fries are sooooooo GOOD. Regularly they are about $7 but on Mondays and Wednesdays they are only $4.99. Also, they have a deal called the Markham special that includes a lb of wings and the chili onion fries for approx. $14. I could never finish this...but I always order it because it's a lot of food and I'm greedy lol this is def one of my new fave spots!"}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of good things about this wing house and I was not let down! I came on a Tuesday because I was told about the cheap wings (came to $9.58 after tax for a pound of wings and a fountain drink).  My friend and I came here for lunch during work hours and since we are only limited to 30mins we decided to call and order a head of time so we can sit in, and our meal came almost as soon as we sat down.  Wow wing house is a bit of a smaller wing house but quite quaint, and the chicken was hot and cooked very nicely and there was plenty of sauce slathered on.  I will definitely be returning for another Tuesday lunch :)"}
{"text":"I've been going here on and off for over a year now. These are the best wings I've ever had. They are nicely sized and very tasty. However, I've grown to dislike paying full price for wings when the weight is mostly bones. I only do take out but will consider dining in when they have specials on wings.  On another note, I don't find the girls here very trusting. My friend paid for his buddy's tab without telling said friend and the bartender pocketed the $20 instead of putting it towards his tab."}
{"text":"Heard a lot from my friends about this place with their chili fries so finally decided to come here for a late night dinner. Located in the corner of a plaza, this place seems to be local hotspot for wings. There's literally only 2 tables for dining in but this place is primarily for takeout. They have the combo of chili fries, 1 lb of wings and a soft drink for about $14.99 which is a pretty good deal. They have over 30 flavours to choose from whether you like them dry, saucy or spicy. There is a flavour for everyone and your tastebuds. I ordered the messy sweet girl which kind of tasted like garlic parm. I thorough enjoyed it and it was quite saucy. I have to say the chili fries were really good. It's hard to believe that onion on fries with a bit a spice and mayo would be that great! They gave pretty good portions for this combo. I was simply stuffed after this. Overall, I really enjoyed their wings and their chili fries!! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I dropped a point for pricing,, 2 pounds of wings and fries even with toppings with no drinks seems a bit pricey for 29 plus bucks. However the fries with the chili (hot pepper not chili con carne) and onion etc was super tasty. The wings (the honey hot and the dry bbq) were both very tasty lots of heat in the BBQ but I'll admit I liked the honey hot more. Service was fast, super friendly. Eat in area is tiny, no bathroom. Lots of walk in traffic etc so it's a busy little spot in a good way."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning twice from here. Wanted to believe it was just something else but it's most definitely their food. They either don't throw out old sauces, or don't wash their hands but this place is gross"}
{"text":"If you MUST order from this place, do yourself a favour and do take-away. Wings are ok tasting but everything else was disastrous! This wing place is the definition of shady; dark and dingy environment with just one person working.  We ordered four pounds, and got one pounds wings first, waited 10 more minutes after finishing our food to get the rest of the order. The place is dark even with all the lights on, but the owner turned off half of the lights after some people left, so it became even darker. The tables appeared to be clean, but the sides of the table were so filthy, our clothes were sticking to it; I shudder to think what the kitchen would be like.  I should mention though, the owner didn't charge us for ordering extra flavours(only two are allowed in the deal), so there is that. The flavours weren't bad either, but the spicy ones are really not spicy at all.   TL;DR: Dark and shady environment, ok wings, do take-out if you must eat from here."}
{"text":"The service is meh here in terms of communication but the wings and chili onion fries are worth it. I only get the chili onion fries and a few wing flavours. The wings are amazing here too! I usually get vans favourite, Kansas Knockout, Messy Sweetheart or Devils Ranch. Not too bad for the price I spent $20 for a pound of wings and chili onion fries."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite takeaway wing joint. I mainly enjoy the fact that it not only offers your standard wing flavours but also caters to the South Indian spice palette.   I get the wings in Devil's Ranch (so good) and the Chilli Fries. I always get the fries without onions, but it's a preference.   Wait time is about 5-10 mins but I usually call ahead. I would definitely advise calling ahead during the evening/late nights on Friday or Saturday as they tend to get really busy.  There is limited seating available inside.    I give this place a 4/5 stars. -1 star because they sometimes put onions in my fries (I really can't stand onions) when I specifically ask them not to. I've had to drive all the way back once but they were apologetic. They also open at 4PM so no lunch time craving!  I recommend this place though. It's a must for wing and spice lovers alike."}
{"text":"Small place with a few seats. More of a takeout joint. 1lb of honey garlic and 1lb of Cajun wings and an order of chilli onion fries totaled about $29 taxes included. Service was quite fast. Within 5 minutes my takeout order was ready.   Probably the worst wings I have had. The honey garlic wings were not crispy at all. It felt like there was a mushy outer layer of batter even though these are not battered wings I don't think.  The dry Cajun wings did not fair any better. It didn't taste like Cajun spices at all. It tasted more like a home brew of Indian spices.   Since so may reviews mentioned that the chili fries were so good I thought I would give it a try. Worst decision ever and worst fries I have ever eaten. The fries were hard. Not crispy but hard. I was picturing chili sauce on the fries but it only had chili powder with some mayo and a bunch of chopped onions. NO CHILI SAUCE ON CHILI FRIES??? WTF??? Tasted so bad I had to throw them out.   4 star average review for this wing joint? If you want some good wings in the Markham area then try some from \"Big Bone BBQ and Wicked Wings\" or give \"King Edward's Arms\" a try. I guarantee it will be better than what they sever here."}
{"text":"The wings are okay but i have seen employee smoke infront of the estabilishment which has resulted in me never wanting to visit again. Prices have gone up recently and evn though they have lots of flavors, only a few are good. It is a very tiny place situated in the corner of a back street and parking is a little limited. Again a okay place for wings. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Texas homicide wings + gar par fries is my go-to order. I drive 10 minutes each way from Scarborough because it's worth it."}
{"text":"Hands down, best wings in Newmarket. For almost 2yrs this has been our fav wing joint for my kids and I and the boys post golf. They have daily deals, Wednesday is a really good one and the options for wings are almost endless. If I could offer a suggestion, would be to add a few more taps. Have also done takeout here and the service is quick, wings are usually ready before I get there. If you're a spice head this place is for you, try the onion and chili fries, you won't regret it...."}
{"text":"The chilli onion fries are a must! I always come here for the fries, I also like the wings here. I have tried honey garlic, spicy gar-par, and town of Jaffna. All 3 flavours are pretty good, but town of Jaffna is super spicy! So if spicy wings aren't your thing, do not get that flavour. The wings aren't small, also portions are pretty decent. Not too little, not too much.  The service is pretty fast, but I usually call in ahead of time so I won't have to wait long for my order. However, I feel like at times they do get confused with orders if you order a few things at once, so just make sure you double check your dishes. In my opinion, it's not an expensive take-out restaurant (there's limited seating inside).  Definitely recommend this place for take-out!"}
{"text":"Wings are soaked in sauce, becomes slow cooked wings. Wings are pretty big, and wing night only for dine in only."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and the Markham special. Wings and chili fries were really good. Pizza was a huge fail! I truly believe it's store bought frozen cheese pizza and they just add the requested toppings and throw it in the oven."}
{"text":"The good: 1) chili onion fries are amazing but only when fresh. The moment they become room temperature it loses a lot of its appeal. 2) Many wing flavours to choose from.   The bad: so many choices of flavours but when asked for help, the staff isn't quick to recommend popular flavours. When they are busy they will sometimes mix up orders. However service should improve over time."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with their wings!!! We always seem to get the same flavors which are spicy garlic parm, any dry rub and or heaven and hell. I especially love their fries on the Markham special  and am actually craving and salivating for it right now as I type.... mmmmmm so good!!!! They are the perfect crunch and even though I am not a huge fan of the saucy flavors I still end up eating them up here!!!"}
