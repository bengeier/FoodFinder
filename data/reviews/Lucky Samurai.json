{"text":"Its okay. Not great, nothing special, just okay. I think people like it so much because its cheap. Sakura is so much better."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Sake Express when it was at this location, but this place is just as good if not better! I had the yakitori chicken with broccoli and it was cooked perfectly. There was enough for me to have leftovers afterwards and the cream cheese rolls are delicious!

Service was fast, friendly, and the prices were not too high for what you get. I'll definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The loudest of the loud in terms of Japanese Steakhouse style food in the gastonia area.  Also really good sushi.  Price wise this place is very cheap compared to local competition and they have a daily special which usually amounts to five dollars with a water. 

 I ate enough food for four people one day and only spent 20 bucks.  

If David Lynch started a Japanese Steakhouse style restaurant, this would be it.

10,000 prayer emoji signs in the direction Lucky Samurai, may you have a fantastic and successful business."}
{"text":"So as a heads up I used to love this place.  The food was always fresh and flavored well.  You also couldn't beat the prices.  I'm not sure what has changed in the last six months or so but I have been back several times and I don't think I will be anymore. 
If you go in the restraunt and sit down Everything now comes in styrofoam to-go containers, even the soups.  Literally the soup is so hot it picks up the styrofoam flavor which I think can be toxic. Its really weird to order sushi and hibachi and it comes in a closed to go box along with your drink.  
Now moving onto the quality of food.  The last few times I have been there the food has tasted different but the last time the chicken was chewey,  the shrimp sauce tasted very different, and the rice was stiff.  I couldn't tell you about the carrots because they didn't put them in. I also had a order of edamame, the portion size was small and the beans were old. The tea is also not the same,  I think they switched brands or it is always overcooked.
I am very disappointed, this used to be one of my favorite restaurants.  Moving over to tacky to go containers really screams that the owner is cheap or lazy.  I just wish the food was as good as it used to be. I hate to leave one star but I sadly wouldnt recommend this place anymore ."}
{"text":"Great food fast.  I eat there once a week and it's always great. Much better than similar style restaurants."}
{"text":"It's tough to fill the shoes of Sake Express but this place does it awesome. It was surprisingly quiet when we went as it should be packed for how good it is. Our server, Reba was super nice and professional. Id highly recommend Lucky Samurai to anyone thinking of Sake Express but not wanting to wait or get jeered at by a sassy teen wait staff."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Not a fancy place by far, but the food was delicious. Server was so nice and very attentive. Had the Hibachi low carb chicken. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!!!  The staff is super friendly.  Quality food, super prices.  Service is fast.  I cannot say enough good things about this place.  It is in the same building that Sake used to be in right at the mall in Gastonia, NC.  Convenient location.  One you try this you will think twice about going to some of these other Japanese fast food places."}
{"text":"Nope. the service was strange and the writing on the bill was not legible or correct. The carrots were shockingly horrible and the \"fried rice\" was sour. Will not ever eat there again."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I placed a order for pick up. The food that I ordered was not correct so the owner stayed that I would need to drive 30 minutes back to the establishment or lack of better words and return the food. I stated to the manager over the phone that that is not possible since I am so far away. They then stated then you can just keep what you have and hung up the phone in my face. Unprofessional!!!!"}
{"text":"Our family's favorite sushi and hibachi restaurant. Great food and staff. Awesome specials throughout the week."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent customer of Sake Express for a long time. However, Lucky Samurai has won me over. The seasoning of the food is very good. My order was great I had a chicken dish with peppers and onions and other sorts of good tasting stuff. I tried this dish from the recommendation of the owner and I was pleased. They are always very friendly and at tentative to their guests. They always engage and try to get to know me as a customer. That's why I keep going back."}
{"text":"My whole family loves this place. It is a great substitute since Koto shut down. The owners are also very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Japanese quick-service place in Gastonia. Juicy and tender meat and their sushi selection is outstanding for the price. Now that they've added bento boxes and upgraded the dining room, you'd be crazy to go anywhere else and spend more money. Definitely an upgrade over the other Japanese restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Tasteless swill, basically a Chinese take out place with a dining room. Sweet carrots are disgusting, overcooked and so sweet they made my teeth hurt. We asked for the hot yellow mustard packets and she brought us a ton that were all a weird color and had separated in the packets. My BF opened one and tasted it, it was sour. Gross. Waitress was nice but completely in the weeds once people started coming in (no siracha for us).  Wall next to our booth was dirty with old food. Urp...I'm sure I'll pay for this later."}
{"text":"I had hibachi chicken and vegetables for the first time recently and it was really good. I stopped after work to buy the same thing I had before, expecting the same great flavor. I was sooo disappointed, the chicken was dry and over cooked and actually tasted like it was old. The flavor didn't taste the same at all. I don't know if the chef changed, but consistency is key for repeat customers. I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"We tried Lucky Samurai for the first time last night.  We love nearby Sake Express, so we probably wouldn't have tried Lucky Samurai if not for a friend's recommendation. I am so glad we did.  The food was timely, flavorful, and priced well. No disservice meant to Sake because they are a good restaurant.  But Lucky Samurai was better!  We visited on a Saturday evening around 7:00 and it was not crowded.  Our order was taken quickly, and our sushi order was brought to our table within five minutes.  For our entrees, I had the chicken with pineapples (niku kare chicken).  The chicken was slightly spicy, but only slightly.....just the way I like it. The chicken was very tender and flavorful and the pineapples added a nice contrast.  The fried rice was exactly on point in texture and flavor, as were the sliced carrots....not too sweet and not mushy.  My husband's meal was equally fresh and tasty.  He also had the fried bananas which looked divine.  Regarding price, they were very reasonable.  Entree and sushi prices were a little lower than Sake.  Definitely a good value.  Lucky Samurai will be my new \"go-to\" place for quick weeknight take-out for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, exactly how I ordered.  Lo carb, light oil. Better habachi, atmosphere,  and prices than Saki. Did not try sushi. One suggestion would be fresh carrots as an option instead of sweet carrots with lo carb meal."}
{"text":"We stopped by here in route to SC. What a pleasant surprise! We had the Tiger Roll, the Spicey Tuna Roll, the Arctic Roll & the Crunchy Roll. All were good & all unique! We also had miso soup & seaweed salad. The atmosphere is very casual.  Clean. Quiet. You order at the counter & they bring it too you.  Very pleasant staff.  We only dealt w/ Anglos. 

I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place, good food, great service.the staff is nice, I disagree with the other review, I don't think giving the check before customers finish their food is rushing them.i don't mind that at all."}
{"text":"So, the last time I went to another Japanese fast food place in town it was crowded over.  I heard about Lucky Samurai opening and thought instead of sitting in line for thirty minutes I'd give them a try.  Oh boy am I glad I did!  I've NEVER had anything this good at Sake Express! (the other place.)  We tried yakitori shrimp; the shrimp was cooked to perfection and the onions and peppers brought a really nice flavor to the dish.  The rice doesn't taste like it's been sitting in sugar like I've had at other places, and the carrots this night were slightly al dente, which I LOVE.  I can't stand the mushy carrots you usually get; it means they've been sitting forever!  I won't be heading back to Sake anytime soon; no offense to those guys because they're pretty good, but Lucky Samurai is SOOO YUMMY!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!! Not very clean dining room and had to wait for my to go order while the staff all stood around and had a nice chat. The food is terrible. Steak and chicken both tough and rather nasty. The \"sushi\" was a joke. It about made my fiancee sick off of one bite of tuna roll. I would recommend running as fast as you can to any other place to eat."}
{"text":"I had the noodles with hibachi chicken. Noodles are good but the chicken is low quality."}
{"text":"I go here for take out usually. Prices were fair and the food for the price was good. Last run through the drive through I noticed they had bento boxes. So my son and I stopped in. 

First think of note is the fresh coat of paint that brightened up the place and works much better with the furniture. We ordered a pair of large bento boxes. The sushi was good and my son loved the Japanese taco, and the sweet potato fries now have me thinking of taking my wife and daughter with me. Presentation was nice in a bento box proper. So nice uptick in interior makes eating in a very good option now. 

So good food for the price, good wait staff and a drive through that is fast and efficient. A regular solid Japanese fast food restaurant option.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever came to this restaurant and I am very unhappy already. I didn't even eat here yet. I gave them a bad rating because today I came through drive thru, there was a car in front of me that was pulled up and nobody even came to the window to help, the open sign was off- so I figured they were closed but wait why are there people walking in and dining in? Why does your website say you close at 10pm on Thursday? I pulled out of line at 9:44pm After I got to Sake Express I called this restaurant and asked what time they close and the lady said \"we close at 9:30 everyday\" I then asked \"why does your website say 10pm\" she changed the subject and said \"what did you want\" I ONLY WANTED 4 cream roll!! She said \"ok come back and come in and get it\" I most definitely DID NOT COME BACK! Stop acting like Sake because they will put their customers first before their closing hour!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but it didn't jump out at me. There are tons of hibachi style Japanese restaurants around the Gaston/ Cleveland area and Lucky Samurai was pretty average. Better than Yamato's but not as good as Japanese Express in Shelby, Sake Express, or the now closed Mizuki in Shelby.

The food was pretty standard with not much differentiating it from anywhere else. Everyone was friendly and the service was quick. I also really like the design of the building and the decoration inside. I'd definitely be willing to give this place another chance, though."}
{"text":"Very good and inexpensive. As good as some of the more expensive Japanese steakhouses I've been to. One thing though, they did rush us out. We had our check before we were done with our food. A big no-no when eating out."}
{"text":"First and last time eating here! Co-workers & myself decided to give this place a try after getting tired of Sake Express, however that proved to not be a good decision! We all had simple orders, which we phoned in ahead of time, and because we had a few sushi orders they told us a total of 15 to 20 minutes.  I left the office after 10 minutes, arrived and had to wait an additional 20 min to get our food. In addition to the slow service, the sushi was definitely not sashimi-grade, fresh, nor was it tasty! Needless to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Lucky Samurai many times.  Each time is just as excellent. In many ways they are just like Sake except the quality of the food is better.  The menu and price are about the same but the sushi is 10 times better!  I also like their plate Niku Kare I think.  The chicken that is cooked with the pineapples is delicious!  There are also better combination meals available.  Yes, it is not as crowded as Sake Express but don't be deceived!  I always choose Lucky Samarai when I want some sushi.

Edit 05/30/2016
OMG... What happened to the sushi?  I ordered a Philadelphia roll and I think they put cooked Salmon in it.  The salmon was a light pink color and it look minced... Very confused.  This was the most gross sushi I have ever eaten.  I have always told people that Lucky Samurai has the best sushi as far as quality for the price.  Not anymore.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I usually give a place one or two tries before I review it. But this place I will not be coming anytime soon! I ordered steak and shrimp. The rice was horrible hard, the shrimp tasted like paste,and the steak you can taste the sourness of spoiled meat. Trust me not even soy sauce or whatever sauce can cover it."}
{"text":"Service was good, but I would not return for the food.  The sushi was pretty meh, and the teriyaki chicken and brown rice left me with a bit of a weird aftertaste. No alcohol either.  Won't see me back there."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way from VA to GA for a quick late lunch, per Yelp and Google reviews.  The reviews didn't lie; it was very slow in there mid-afternoon, extremely fast courteous service, and the food was served in minutes. We had chicken egg rolls, teriyaki beef, and teriyaki tofu. All very fresh and so good!!! Happy tummies here! :D

OH, and they have a drive-through!!!"}
{"text":"Im sitting and wait for my food im not really happy.Maybe this food will be good.Idk what kind of sushi chef they hired but its a no for me.The sushi taste ok but looks weird I never seen a rainbow roll that looked so weird but over all I came I ate And now I must Review.The food could be better."}
{"text":"This place looks very suspect from the outside and even from the inside to be honest. But a lot of tasty hole in the wall joints will look that way. Service was friendly and attentive and we received our food quickly. Nothing too special, but everything was pretty good all around. I had the egg rolls and the chicken, steak, and shrimp hibachi combo. They got an extra star for their extra friendly service, for not being stingy with the white sauce, and for letting us hang out a bit after our meal to finish our meeting."}
{"text":"First time eating from here i got the cowgirl roll and the crunchy roll.  Both were yummy !! I Will be going back."}
{"text":"Lucky has some of the best sushi I've had in a while.  I recommend Lucky to people all the time and eat there on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Eaten here many times. Good sushi with great Friday night buy one get one half off. Great no carb offering as well. Must try the $1 soup, simple warm delicious."}
{"text":"Good takeout Japanese. Better than Sake Express in my opinion. Ordered dinner through the online app tonight and food was ready as soon as I got there. Very fast service. I think the owner ran out to take orders from the drive through since the line was a little back. He seemed very fast paced and caring about the customers having to wait. 10% off on online orders. For all the other bad reviews I'd give this place another try."}
{"text":"Excellent takeout!! The teriyaki chicken is on-point!! The owners are awesome and cook great. They are getting a make over, it something to get used too. The portions are pretty good for the price. The fried rice is awesome always moist and flavorful. Ever in town the teriyaki salmon is the best id say, its nice and crispy just right juicy too.. You guys rock"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place.  We are big Sake Express fans, but we wanted to try the new place. We were afraid it would be exactly the same, but we were pleasantly surprised to have different flavors. I had the Yakitori (spelling) shrimp with zucchini, onions and noodles, and my husband had the same with rice, mushrooms and onions. They we some of the best noodles I've ever had. We both got iced Jasmine tea (one semi sweet, one unsweet), they were very tasty.  The sweet carrots were delicious.  Very important.... I believe the woman who served us was the owner and she was beyond sweet. I really appreciate good service, and she was great. I hope they do well, and I think any Sake fans will love this place too.   (I copied and pasted some of my review from google here for ease, but I wanted to review them on multiple avenues.  That's how much we liked them.)"}
{"text":"It's ok. The first couple times I went there right after they opened was very good, but since then the rice was all mushy and gross. Sake is much better and literally 2 seconds up the road"}
