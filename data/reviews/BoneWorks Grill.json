{"text":"One of the best places around for a burger. I've been here 4 or 5 times already. They know how to cook. So if you order it medium, from my experience, it comes out perfectly cooked with a warm pink center. Not overcooked like most places.  Burgers are great, pulled pork sandwich is good too."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but the service was very lacking.  When I came in it was very slow and the waiter was very slow about taking my order and my drink was empty for over half of the time I was there.  I waited over 10 minutes between the time I finished my meal and the time that I got tired of waiting and tracked the manager down for my check, only to be overcharged by $10.

If someone else is paying I'll consider going back, but I'm not going to go back on my own ever again.  When I spend over $25 for a meal for one person I expect excellent service, which I most definitely did not get tonight."}
{"text":"Very good new restaurant. I had the ribs. Quite good. Atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"First off, this place is more of a 3.5 than a 3. We live fairly close to the BoneWorks Grill, so decided to check it out one night. We were definitely pleased!

When we went, we were just in the mood for something casual, so my wife ordered a grilled chicken salad, and I had a mushroom & swiss burger. Both were awesome! The burger was cooked perfectly, on a homemade bun with some great fries.

They also give you fresh baked rolls with this cinnamon butter. Pretty much like crack-cocaine. I couldn't stop eating them.

The whole wait-staff was very nice. They didn't try to rush you and get the table turned.

I thought the atmosphere was very nice, but had a few design flaws. I don't think they utilized the space very well, leaving not much room for seating, and had the tables too close to the door. This can get really cold in a Pittsburgh winter!

However, our waitress mentioned they bought the space next-door and were putting in a sports bar. I'm really pumped for that, because the area looked huge, and we are desperately in need of a nice bar to go and watch the Pens/Steelers games and get some good food.

We'll definitely be back to this place!"}
{"text":"Though I promised myself I would never return, I decided I would give the Boneworks another shot.  However, this time my dad and I dined in the sports bar section rather than the fine dining area.  Let's begin.

First off, this is more like a 2.5 star rating, but I was so happy with the improvement and the atmosphere of the place that I decided to round up.  With that being said, the atmosphere of this place cannot be beat.  The sports bar set is fabulous and the bar is simply gorgeous.  If you are looking for a nice bar in the area to enjoy a drink and watch the game, check this place out.

Now the prices are still a little expensive for this area of the neighborhood, but I would be more than willing to pay big prices for good food.  That being said, the wings were very good.  Though I wish they had some sort of garlic parmesean sauce in the menu, but I digress.  Wings were meaty, tasty, and decently priced.  $5.50 for a half dozen and $10 for a dozen, not to mention Tuesday and Thursday is 50 cent wing night.  

The time it took for these wings to come out though killed me.  My dad and I were starving, and it took them forever to bring the food out, but the wait I think was worth it.  However the wait for the hamburger and 4 onion rings was not.

I got a burger that had grilled onions, mushrooms, and Gouda on it, yet I found myself wondering where the hell all the toppings were.  I counted 4 measly, and i mean tiny, mushrooms on the patty, and 4 small pieces of onion.  There was also only one small slice of Gouda, which wasn't even melted.  However the enormous size of this burger made up for the lack of toppings and nonexistence of any sauce. Side note, add some kind of mayo to that burger.  The bun was also toasty and delicious.  My dad agreed, though the toppings were disappointment, the burger size was awesome.

Now the onion rings were the biggest disappointment of my meal.  They give you the choice of either fries, sweet potatoes fries, or onion rings.  I love my onions, so I naturally chose the rings; however, when my plate arrived I was very upset.  There were only 4 small onion rings accompanying my burger.  They were delicious, but I just wish I had more.

I am so happy that this place has gotten better.  I am definitely going to come back here, especially for the wing night deal!  I hope they get some garlic parm wings though!"}
