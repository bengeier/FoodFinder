{"text":"Friendly staff. Delicious lattes. Tables and chairs as well as lounge chairs and pub style table and chairs. Coffee is reasonably priced as well.  Didn't have the money to try the pastries but I would have liked to - they looked good!  I would recommend to anyone in a heartbeat."}

I love my chai teas super sweet and spicy and I've finally found a place that does it just right without having to add anything (didn't even need the cinnamon I added). Staff is super friendly and my friends and I will definitely be stopping in to study for our upcoming exam."}

{"text":"My new favorite coffee shop!  If you are in the area you have to go and check this place out.  The coffee is great and the people are really nice.  They now have waffles, tried one out today, and they are great too!"}
{"text":"King Coffee Roastery is a fantastic little coffee shop in north Phoenix. Their coffee tastes incredible, and the everything bagel I bought was awesome. They have a great atmosphere with tasteful music, couches, armchairs, and some board games. The only thing I wish it had more of is natural lighting, the three windows at the front don't shed enough light at the back of the store. However, this isn't enough to knock it down to 4 stars. In short, I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Theirs good news and bad new in this 5 star review rating but YOU can help it become all good. Carry on reading for the full story. 

First things first let me say, old style coffee shops barely exist. You can find them buried down south in Tennessee maybe. The ambient slow tones, table options, beautiful art a few couches and most importantly simple but GREAT coffee. I truly believe we need more small shops like King Coffee Roastery in growing Arizona.

King Coffee Roastery embodies the old school coffee shop with its local art pieces hanging on the wall, dim lighting, pretty teal colored walls and selective seating. Truly a place to having meeting, greeting or alone time just for mind and spirit. Your choice! 
They even have live music on certain times and days, how cool is that? Follow them on Instagram or Facebook for updates on that if you're into that. 

Coffee right? Probably what you're here for. It's great in simplest form. My first time here I got the caramel macchiato (THAT FOAM IS TO DIE FOR, way better than Starbucks) and a strawberry and chocolate chip waffle. It was a mother's day special and I paid 7 bucks for all of it. You read that right. It was awesome, nothing fancy but the waffle batter is great. They have protein waffles worth a try. Since it's a small shop they make it to order, and it's best you have a seat they're making it themselves. With a working crew of two people. For now it works and it's no harm but I can only imagine the time once they get even more busier. \"sorry about the wait\" is usually said when they bring the food but they work very hard and it's not really a long wait. Keep it up King Coffee! 

Coffee options range from drip coffee(classic) to tea latte, food options mostly consist of house made wraps such as BLT, pesto, southwest , country. Breakfast consist of the waffle with add on options, many parfait options, and chia pudding. The best part about all of this they don't cost a fortune like other coffee shops. All price options range from $2- $7. Catch that at your old favorite shop. Ha! Awesommmeeeeee. 

I know what you're thinking wheres the bad news if all this good stuff was said. Well you remember I mentioned Starbucks above, having lesser tasty foam well unfortunately and fortunately possibly a Starbucks is being built on this corner of Union Hills. A chain Starbucks next to Clean Freak CarWash. That's bad news because, this shop is twice as better then Starbucks and I dislike chain business taking over American grown shops. The prices at Starbucks will break you, if you're smart you will come here when Starbucks is built up. I promise you, you want regret this great spot. 

Check out my pics below & happy sipping."}
