{"text":"Boy was this place unfriendly or what.   The rudest customer service i have ever had in madison.   we just went in to scope the place out and grab a cold drink while on our bike ride.  first of all, its just a bar.   when they say bike friendly, they are talking about the motorcycle type and not the bicycle type.     its as far from the bicycle type as they come.         we saw a bunch of guys sitting at the bar watching a soap opera on the tvs.  not making it up.    we were treated like we interrupted their quality time.   the food we got was mediocre at best.      too bad i dunno of any other nearby stop over for those on the bike trail.    i wouldnt go back unless im desperate."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, friendly staff. The value couldn't be better. Nothing too fancy, but solid all around!"}
{"text":"Simple tasty breakfast and excellent friendly service.   We stay at a cabin nearby once a year, and always stop here for Sunday breakfast on the way out of town. The service is very friendly and accommodating--we were picky about our food, and they made everything cheerfully to spec. If you're here in the autumn, try the pumpkin and chocolate chip pancakes. And if you don't have much of a sweet tooth, ask for 5 chocolate chips in the pancake  it's perfect!"}
{"text":"What everyone else said. Nice job Reviewers!  Ok, Yelp is making me say more to pet review...  Tara T nailed it. Friendly. Fun. Good service.  Did not have food but drinks and beers were great. Tuck Pence gave a great performance - so kudos to Riley Tavern for booking great performers."}
{"text":"Whether you're in your car, riding a motorcycle or a bicycle,  or out for a run, there's no place quite like the Riley Tavern on a beautiful fall Sunday. Get there early for the pancake breakfast or come later just to relax and take in nature on the front or side porch. During the summer, the last Sunday of every month is the Rag Tag Market. A kitschy conglomerate of artists, henna tatoo purveyors, homemade soap and exotic scent sellers, jewelry makers, and the ubiquitous chiropractic/masseuse. You probably find something you just can't live without.  Alas, no velvet paintings of dogs playing poker or of Elvis. As small as the place is, on these Sundays, they have a live band with no cover. The several that I've seen here were actually really good! Bands play from 3-6 p.m. You won't find Mal√∂rt, or craft cocktails ala Merchant or Heritage Tavern, but you'll get a good strong pour and reasonable prices.  Just remember to bring cash. They don't take credit cards but there is an ATM on site which will hit you for about $2.50 to access your money. (plus what your bank will charge you) It's a little hard to find but the perfect place to end up on that leisurely drive in the country."}
{"text":"Don't come here for fine dining and fancy cocktails. Do come here to have a good time. Love to run or bike here on the trail on Sunday mornings and enjoy brunch or come later for a drink. Here's the deal with brunch on Sunday.  Pro's: There are pancakes.  And the most delicious, amazing, drooling, sausage in the world.  That's what you can have.  Don't ask for anything else or the sassy waitresses get crabby.  They have coffee, tea, orange juice or alcohol. Drop a pancake on the floor?  There's a dog roaming around, so don't worry. Line up at the door, ten minutes later the place is packed and the bar seats are full of old men, bikers, cyclists and neighbors.   It's got great atmosphere with a covered deck looking out over the trail.   PS They will not serve you breakfast outside. Added bonuses, they claim its ten minutes from anywhere, Riley Fest, alcoholic drinks in glass jars, snowmobile trail, bike trail, nature, and I always love seeing bikers and cyclists together in spandex and leather."}
{"text":"A gem located in the middle of no where.  The Riley Tavern is a classic Wisconsin tavern.  They don't try to be anything besides that.  A simple tavern selection of 4 local beers on tap, a modest bar food menu, a decent porch and STIFF drinks. The place is perfect for an afternoon of day drinking.  I have heard that they breakfast is awesome but i have yet to experience it for myself.  This is the type of place that would be awesome for a Packer game. Maybe next Sunday..."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but a nice friendly Wisconsin bar. It has an outdoor seating area with a view without cars or roads to numb your senses.The bike trail runs right by here and that alone is worth coming here for if a biker. Motor cycle people like the pleasant drive here though the rural roads as well. Check your GPS on how to get here. There are a few ways but Mineral Point road is sort of the main way. On Friday they have baked cod on the menu that is as good as it gets. A large piece of fish with exception coleslaw and a potato thing like a twice baked that was all yummy. They also have burgers and  other bar stuff that are better than most. Make the trip out here and relax, pretend you are way out in the boonies somewhere because thats what it feels like."}
{"text":"We went for the pancake breakfast on Sunday and the place was packed. The place is very minimal, we had 3 menu options, Blueeberry Cranberry Chocochip + self-service coffee and tea + OJ. $6 per person and basically you get what you pay for. But somethign about the secretive location made me give an extra star."}
{"text":"Riley Tavern is a wonderful place to stop.  If your looking to just sit on the beautiful porch or enjoy a drink inside the bar...Look no further to experience authentic feel of an old tavern.  Great drinks and daily homemade food. The bar is extremely clean and bartenders were \"Johnny on the Spot\"! I can't wait to go back! !"}
{"text":"We love the Tuesday night pizza:  wonderful!  It is crispy and full of whatever ingredients one chooses: $12.50.  Fabulous people who wait on you and bring you into conversation."}
