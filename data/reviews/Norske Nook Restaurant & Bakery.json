{"text":"I've had another meal there and the whole experience was much better than the last time,  Service and food delivery was prompt, the pies are still awesome.  I had a burger that was quite good.  If I had to single out something for criticism it's that the burger was rather small,  All in all, a vast improvement over the previous visit."}
{"text":"We just left this place and it was amazing. Deserves better reviews. Our server, Aimee, was excellent! All of our food...Chili, Rueben on Cranberry Wild Rice bread, Quiche with Potato Pancakes, Burger with Lattice Fries, Apple Pie, Blueberry Pie, and Cranberry Apple Pie...was definitely 5 stars! Great food at a reasonable price and right off the expressway. We will stop here every time we pass through!"}
{"text":"I checked out the Nook during a friends and family soft opening. I visited the location in Osseo many years ago, and it's great to have one just around the corner in De Fo--although my waistline will beg to differ! The interior is very welcoming, with homey, slightly kitschy Norwegian decor. More impressive is what greets you right when you walk in the door: the carb-o-licious behemoth that is the bakery case. There are some kinks yet to iron out--really not worth mentioning at this juncture because that IS the purpose of a soft opening. As for the food: it took quite some time for my party to settle on what they wanted, with much flipping from front to back of then menu, and then back again. The Ruben sandwich on pumpernickel was filled with flavorful corned beef, and the bread was excellent. I have to admit that I ordered the Lefse wrap with Swedish meatballs and mashed potatoes because I hadn't tried anything like it before, and it tickled a wild hair. Now that I have had that experience, I likely would not repeat it. It wasn't bad; just really not my thing, as it turned out. The burgers and other sandwiches looked great, so maybe I'll take the less exotic route next time. We capped off our meal with a slice of pie, which was a rich, decadent little piece of heaven. Overall, I have positive feelings about this place and will be interested to see how it develops after the official opening."}
{"text":"Just left the Norske Nook in De Forest.  We arrived at 6:10 PM.  ,Sign on the door indicates  open til 8, sign on the corner electric sign indicated open until 9.  The hostess greeted us with \"We're not serving anyone else or we'll never get to go home tonight.\"    There was no thanking us for stopping, apologizing for the circumstances, asking us to give them a try another time, or even a smile, just complete rudeness and lack of tact.   We're familiar with the Osseo location and were super excited to have one locally so I hope we can chalk this up to working the kinks out, but we have never been treated so rudely while attempting to dine out."}
{"text":"I'M ONLY GIVING THIS A 4 STAR FOR THE PIE! After all, that really is what they're known for.   I've been trying to come up with how to write a review about our entire experience. I couldn't come up with anything the other reviewers hadn't already written. There is at least a small piece (if not all) of the other reviews that are 100 % true.  I would not make a special trip for breakfast, lunch or dinner. PIE, I would make a special trip for the PIE!"}
{"text":"I have been to some of the other Norske Nook Restaurants in Wisconsin so I was excited to see one in the Madison area. I went at lunch time and got soup and sandwich so I would not be too full for the pie. The food is always delicious no matter if you get breakfast, lunch or dinner and you have to have a slice of pie even if you just take it home. My favorite is the chocolate peanut butter pie and you can tell it is made from scratch, even the crust.  They were very busy but the service was good and we did not have to wait too long. The new restaurant is bright but still has that authentic feel. If you have never been to a Norske Nook Restaurant you are truly missing one of Wisconsin's best restaurants. I will definitely be back again and again so I can try the many different entrees and desserts."}
{"text":"Norske Nook, in DeForest Wi, is much like the other 3 Norske Nooks in Hayward, Rice Lake, and Osseo--that is to say, great comfort food, a stunning array of different kinds of pie, and homey service, all with a Norwegian touch--Dragons peeking from the gables of the building, rosemaling in the interior decor, lefse as a choice with your meal. (I was disappointed in my GMC truck--its OnStar navigation did not know of the DeForest location, though it knew about the other 3!) The coffee was OK; the meal was good; the pie of course was very nice."}
{"text":"Went at 5:00 Friday. We had the nicest waitress. Food and service were very good. I had the spinach salad, my wife had the fish fry and my friend had the smelt wrap - all were very tasty. Then we had pie for desert that was exceptional."}
{"text":"Ugh! Worst wait for food at a \"small town\" restaurant ever! Restaurant was not busy or full. We were seated immediately but then waited 20mins for a waitress and had to ask for waters then immediately ordered our food. Waited for an hour for our food that came at different times and not all of it together and wasn't right. Food was mostly COLD! Zero explanations from waitress or the manager.  We were offered pie as compensation for the terrible service that we turned down! We did not want to wait for pie and feared it would definitely not be worth the wait at all! Reluctantly the manager took care of our bill of the food we barely ate...left hungry! Do NOT waste your time with this place! Go to the long standing family owned and operated Deforest Family Restaurant for good and HOT food and much much better service!  My family and friends will not be back to Norske Nook."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! The cherry crisp pie I had is out of this world. I travel quite a bit and having a home cooked meal with a warm staff makes travel to much easier. Job well done! Thank you"}
{"text":"Best pie in America. Not only was the food great, but we had two servers, Diana and Ana, gave great service and made the whole experience fantastic."}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever had!! Like hospital food , so bland , small portions and slow service. Don't waste your $$"}
{"text":"We had dinner here once soon after they opened. The dinners were ok. Mine was good (fish) and my wife's was below average (potato turkey mashup). The pies are the real draw here. Very good no matter kind you like."}
{"text":"Comfort food with a side of lefse. A couple of nice vegetarian options. Very friendly service, and clean restrooms. We didn't try the pie, we were too full. On a nice street with a good walking sidewalk, so you can take a stroll after you eat"}
{"text":"Went to get a bite to eat on 7/29/16 it was about 8:30. We waited to be seated but all they ever did was look at us and then help everyone else but us! I finally went up to the gal working the cash register and asked if they were seating. I was told they were closing at 9 so were only doing take out orders or helping those who were already seated and had eaten. Would have been nice if someone had come up and told us they were no longer seating people! Did not a good impression on me or our relative who had just flown in from California. As far as I am concerned they get no stars for no service. Only one star because I can't post without at least one star."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening.   Service was good, waitress was pleasent.   Food came reasonably fast, considering the restaurant was crowded.  Had a large pancake and smelt in a wrap.   Both were very good.     I miss having deep fried smelt ever since a seafood restaurant and store closed near campus in Madison around 20 years ago."}
{"text":"Hate this place. Terrible service, long waits, food comes out cold... Just absolutely hate it. Why'd they even open? Will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"We wanted so much to love this place but it was really pretty so-so. Service was very slow, we had to ask to hear the specials even though we'd heard other wait staff tell nearby diners, my husband's water never got refilled. Our main lunch food was good but took forever. but the biggest disappointment was the pie. Order cherry pie and got a pile of crust and filling that looked like ti had been dug out of the last bit. And worse than that, it tasted blah. The place was full and so hopefully it will fill a niche in DeForest but with so many good places to eat in Madison, I doubt we will travel even that little ways again any time soon. If they can improve the service maybe but the pie was still a disappointment."}
{"text":"The worst part of Norske Nook is having to pick just one piece of pie - so many yummy choices, but at $4/slice (enormous slice), there is no reason not to come back tomorrow. We stopped in at dinner time on Sunday and had great service."}
{"text":"I know they're only a week into it following their soft opening, but they need to close the place in order to train staff & get their ducks  in a row. My husband I were there at 12:45 & they were busy but had several empty tables. We were told 30-40 min. but it was only about 15 min. 1st & only good sign. I think the kitchen was behind although we saw several people seated after us that got their food before us. Two ladies in the booth behind us complained about it taking forever to get their food (same waitress as us)...finally they were served & were offered free pie. Ours took forever & I finally caught our waitress to let her know I wanted my soup before my meal which I was pretty sure wasn't going to happen otherwise. Obviously she had never waitressed a day in her life & not capable of being trained. We got our food, then after eating the waiting really began. We said something about getting the bill to what appeared to be someone in charge?? Or not so much? We ordered a couple pieces of pie to go & she seemed to write it down but not sure...cause it never happened. We waited & waited for pie & bill until we finally caught her after she'd been totally oblivious. At 2:45, 2 hrs. later we left the restaurant  having been given a free meal when we went to pay cause we had to be honest once the gal at the register asked if everything was ok. This didn't begin to makes up for the horrible experienced! FYI the Scandinavian meatballs are nothing like Osseo & Rice Lake Norske Nooks:-(  They were horrible! Going to take a long time before we go back if we do. Hope they make it but like I said they need to get their ducks in a row. Don't assume because they have other successful Norske Nooks this one doesn't need work & effort to make it."}
{"text":"PIE? What Pie? \"Where IS the PIE???\"  57.4 mile round trip, drove there specifically for strawberry pie, 1 p.m. - no strawberry pie, opted for fresh raspberry pie, no raspberry pie either, switched yet again to fresh blackberry pie, no blackberry pie either.   Understandable if berries were out of season. Berries ARE IN SEASON, they're plentiful in the grocery stores, on sale & this place that's supposedly known for pie - sadly has NO FRESH BERRY PIES available? Must have never made any today (mid-week), wasn't that busy. The only thing available closely related was a cooked blueberry pie with a thin layer of cream cheese. No FRESH BERRY PIE WHEN FRESH BERRIES ARE PLENTIFUL & IN SEASON. Waste of time & gas driving there. Big disappointment.   Skipped the blueberry cream cheese too cause when you're craving \"Fresh Berry Pie,\" cooked isn't the same. Also there were super-slim picking in the bakery case, a death by chocolate, a butterscotch & some sort of coffee/mocha. Yikes - CALL if you plan to try it, otherwise chances are they may have slim pickings. The only other time we visited, the whipped cream on top of the Snickers pie was \"gummy/sticky\" as in \"old whipped cream\" that's been left sitting too long. Not as in marshmallow topping. What happened to \"Fresh Pies Daily?\""}
{"text":"The pie's (black raspberry) flavor was wonderful.  I would like it better if the fruit pies were not so deep and had more berries than the depth with so much gelatin that is mixed in.  The crust was very very good too but, I didn't seem to have any bottom crust."}
{"text":"Our waitress Diana was very pleasant.  The fish fry was tasty, and for an extra dollar, all you can eat. It was nice to be able to split order and have both fried and baked fish.  Chose yummy pie to take home."}
{"text":"'stopped by today to try one of their famous pies. I bought the cherry crumble pie, made with Door County cherries. This is probably the worst pie I've ever had...ever. It was a sickly sweet, gummy mess. You could barely tell there were cherries in it because there was more \"thickener\" than cherries, and more crumble topping than fruit. In addition, it didn't taste anything remotely like cherries! There was so much almond extract in it that I thought I'd taken a bite of too sweet marzipan! Ugh....do yourself a favor and pick up a jar of Door County cherries and make your own cobbler or pie. Soooo disappointing. (I'd have given this pie no starts if I'd had the option."}
{"text":"Had the Reuben and  split pea soup. All was delicious. The Reuben was made with real corned beef and I ordered it on the wild rice cranberry bread. And don't leave without pie!"}
{"text":"My family and I came for brunch. I ordered the Lefse with egg, cheese and sausage. It came with fresh Hollandaise sauce. It was very filling but we saved room for pie. We enjoyed the entire meal. We walked right in, got seated right away, friendly service and didn't have to wait too long for the food to come. The pie of the month was Blueberry crumble, so we bought one to go. I never had blueberry pie before and it was terriffic! I wish they would open a restaurant in Phoenix, AZ where I live."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Norske after calling the Jetroom and finding out they had an hour wait.  We sat right away but waited 20 minutes before we were helped.  After ordering we waited another 45 minutes for our food to arrive.  The food came and the sides were on the wrong plates, frustrating after waiting an hour for food.  The food was good, but after receiving our check found that some bread and bacon were upcharged on the receipt, took it off of the already low tip.  Decent food, but worst restaurant service I think I've dealt with.  Next time we'll sit and wait at the Jetroom"}
{"text":"Great service. Wait staff knew specials and was very friendly. Had the shrimp basket and my husband had the Friday Fish fry and he loved it. Of course had pie for dessert. So many to choose from but had snickers caramel."}
{"text":"Tried eating here twice. Both times the hostess said it would be an hour or more to be seated (mind you, this was over lunch hour and on a Saturday at 2:30). Plenty of open spaces in the parking lot and open tables but the manager said the kitchen was behind. Someone walking out behind us said they waited over an hour for food and had to leave. I don't care how good their food is, if they can't figure this out I will never try to go back again!"}
{"text":"Pies! Pies! Pies! Oh! And Cookies!!! We always order our holiday pies here! And we enjoy having breakfast here. Nice place to bring family with small children. This place has the best pies in town and their cookies are pretty impressive."}
{"text":"I didn't get to eat here, so I can't comment on the food, but we were seated at 4pm on a quiet Sunday. Sat for 25 minutes, tried to flag down a server. Nada. We walked out and went and ate at Culver's down the road. (We were hangry after driving 500 miles without a meal.)  Also witnessed an employee go out for a smoke break and then go back to work without stopping to wash her hands. Yuck."}
{"text":"Had an Omelette with bacon and sausage, a biscuit and potato cakes.  Fantastic food but service was a little slow today."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Awkward lingering waitress.  Couple times had them bring us the wrong food and it upset my child.  The cherry pie is good.  The soup is good.  The lingonberries are disappointing.  Be careful what you order, stick w pancakes."}
{"text":"Driving back to Chicago down 90/94 craving breakfast but wanted something different than the big chains. So glad we held out.  It's maybe 2 miles off the highway but worth the trip. Plenty of parking nice clean comfortable spot. Out waitress was so friendly and was ready with recommendations.  Kid got a pancake the size of a manhole cover for less than $5!  Also had strawberry cream cheese Norwegian pancake special for only $7.  Both were delicious. I had usual eggs toast bacon breakfast but went with the potato cake rounds which were delicious and worth the trip alone. We couldn't finish everything they brought. Good coffee.  It was my bday so I get free slice of pie had to take it to go cuz we couldn't eat anymore. They had 20 or so varieties?!?  Good free WiFi. Kids are already planning out next trip back."}
{"text":"Great food, marginal service. We came around lunch time intentionally missing the weekend breakfast rush. Even with fewer people, it took a long time for food to come, and we sat with empty coffee cups and water glasses.  When the food came, we requested refills and only water came.   All of that aside, we enjoyed our lefse wraps and pie. The three stars are for the food alone."}
{"text":"Herd about Norske Nook and stumbled by after having dinner nearby somewhere else! Hey couldn't just pass it up hadn't had any desert yet. Can't speak of the food but the pie slice selection is out of this world! Got Three pieces to go from very happy and helpful employees. They were all great and will be coming back to sample the many more choices and also get some breakfast."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for dinner, despite the negative reviews. We didn't wait for a table at all (on a Monday night). We had an extremely pleasant waitress! She was very prompt with everything. The food did take a while, but when I walked past the kitchen area, I feel like it explained why. The kitchen area seems so small in comparison to the high volume of the restaurant! The food was fine - I had a breakfast plate (eggs, hash browns, etc), and everything was cooked well. It's what I would expect from any other casual breakfast diner. Nothing special, but nothing wrong with it either. We took pie home with us, and it was amazing.   While we were there, a woman sitting behind my husband was unbelievably rude to her waitress and the manager. She clearly could not be pleased, no matter what they tried to give her. It was pretty uncomfortable. I felt bad for the waitress and manager - they were SO patient with the customer, even though she continued to be flat out rude right back to them.   Overall, I'd go back. Sure, there are kinks, but we had great service and decent food. I'd recommend going during a slower time, and not having to be anywhere in a rush, since the food did take a little bit. Make sure you get pie. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Each time I have gone here our order has been \"forgotten about\" in the kitchen, which lead to us waiting an hour and a half for our pancake and bacon. Such slow, unorganized service. Pie is great though!"}
{"text":"Only been here a couple times but each time it was an adventure with delicious breakfast and the fun pancake that is the size of your plate it's for sure good portions! Very family friendly and a great brunch place. It is kinda hard to find if you have not been to deforest before but once you've been there it's hard not to see it!"}
{"text":"The service here is usually really slow and not that great. The food is generally bland. The two times I've went here for more than pie I haven't gotten what I ordered. Last time I waited about ten minutes hoping my waitress would come back so I could tell her but she wasn't coming back so I finally just decided to eat what they had brought me instead of going searching for her. Then when I was done eating she came by to bring me the bill. I saw on the bill that she hadn't entered the correct menu item so it was in fact on her that I got the wrong food. The pie is usually good. I've had an occasional pecan slice that was burnt on top."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great breakfast and wonderful service this morning with a large group of 7. Service was prompt and very friendly! Will be back."}
{"text":"Bummer!  My family has been bringing their pie to thanksgiving for years, so when we heard one was opening nearby we were so excited. Sadly it did not meet any of our expectations. The food mediocre at best. The pie was delicious as always, however, we were brought the wrong pie (snickers instead of our favorite, the butterfinger). After one bite we pointed this out to our server and she argued with us. It was not worth the $3 fight. We finished the pie, paid our bill, and left. Since then we returned only for take out pie and you better bet we double checked it prior to leaving."}
{"text":"Meatball sandwich was room temp.  Waitstaff did not return until it was too late.  No offer to comp but was offered a to go box."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great food and pies! Love the baked fish and never had a bad breakfast."}
{"text":"Recently ordered a Cobb salad here and the chicken was faux chicken breast... like not actual grilled chicken breast, but extruded chicken formed into a breast shape and grilled. Needless to say it was disgusting and.....$12 dollars,not worth it. Pie was decent and coffee was good, but I can make both better at home."}
{"text":"Bad service, really bad food. It's a one star restaurant but the pie is really, really good so I give it 2 stars."}
{"text":"We were passing through and found this place. The Norwegian pancakes and lefse breakfast wrap with eggs, sausage, hash browns, and hollandaise sauce were amazing. Great food, great service, and a delightfully charming, clean facility."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times. I keep giving it more chances because I love the one in rice lake. The food is still pretty good here but the service really needs work. Even when the place is pretty much empty during the weekdays it's still takes a good 30-45 min to get your food. The lefse is delicious and I love the Norwegian options. Hopefully the staff gets a little better."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Waitress was not very attentive. Food was good not great. My husband and I had meatballs and mashed potatoes and green beans. Food was not hot. I put butter on my potatoes and beans and it wouldn't even melt. I would have sent it back if the waitress would have come back to check.  Not sure I will ever return."}
{"text":"Decided to ignore the reviews because I love the Osseo location so much.  Thought the service was very good.  Place is clean with a diner feel.  Lunch plates were OK, but really this place is all about the pie.  I ordered rhubarb and got rhubarb / strawberry, which I specifically checked to validate it was only rhubarb before ordering.  (Disappointed but since I had two kids in with me did not want to send back.). My wife had the classic strawberry.  I have had the strawberry at the Osseo location numerous times and this was not the same.  Overall, not a bad experience, but definitely not the same as Osseo."}
{"text":"Ok, go there for pie, but that's it.  I've been here a number of times and the food and help has steadily gone down hill.  I ordered their Corned Beef Hash for breakfast, as I had done before, and it was delicious the first few times.  What came out today was this crispy, mashed down, pancake like thingy floating in grease from the grill.  It was literally swimming in fried grease, and deep brown from being fried.  I sent it back, and showed the server a photo of the hash I had gotten there before.  The server didn't say, sorry, She just picked up the plate and walked away. I had to ask what was happening.  The second order was clearly the same thing, just not smashed down on the grill, but absolutely fried, crispy from the grill, I have never had crispy Corned Beef Hash in my life!  Our friends had things screwed up too, when we mentioned it to who I though was the manager, again no apology.  Best yet, we mentioned it to the cashier, not a \"I'm sorry\" to be found.  Our friends summed it up best by saying, \"Gosh, they made me feel like we were bad customers for asking for what we wanted!  Let's not go there again.  Please.\"  I have to agree.  The food was not very good, and we were made to feel like we were bad for asking for things, like my hash not to be crispy crunchy.  I guess it was just too much ask for, and my friends wanting their croutons for their salad (which were forgotten by the kitchen) was WAY out of line.  Their attitude is basically, \"hey you're lucky we serve food with pie!\" And their food shows it."}
{"text":"I want this place to make it but the food needs to improve.  We had the hot meatball sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy and a side of slaw. All was very bland and lacked flavor. The meatballs tasted more like hot dogs. The consistency was like hot dogs. You can't use a mixer to make meatballs or meatloaf. Bland bland bland. One good thing it wasn't over salted. The bread looked like it was store bought not home made. The slaw was cabbage and mayo no seasoning. I'm Scandinavian and I know how to make meatballs and these were a disappointment. The pie, my husband got the apple and he said it was good. I had lemon merange it was ok nothing great, top was like rubber.  It looked clean and I liked how it was decorated.  Server was very nice, friendly and we didn't have to wait long for our food.  This is my second time here. I had strawberry pie again bland with what appeared to be jello filling with too much water. I like the glazed strawberry pies. One more chance. I want to try the breakfasts."}
{"text":"I dined at the Norske Nook in Deforest about 1 month after it opened opened to the public. It was an early lunch 2 people and we both had brunch type food. The waitress was very rushed and didn't take her time with service. She didn't refill our waters until 5 minutes before we left (they were empty within the first few bites of our food). She served the wrong kind of pie to our table and didn't say thank you or have a good afternoon at the end of our visit. I will not be returning to done at this restaurant. However, their pie is delicious and will purchase pie to go. The two stars are for the wonderful pie and not the service, food or restaurant."}
{"text":"Anticipating a good bowl of soup I was disappointed that they had no gluten free version not even the chili. On the bright side the waitress was fantastic she worked hard to find gluten free items for me and took my money at the table. I did have quite some time waiting to be seated even at 2:30PM. They were not very busy.   I live near by and will stop in now and then to see if there are improvements."}
{"text":"We have been to all of the other Norske Nooks in Wisconsin. The food has always been uniformly pretty good. But the service has varied. Our last visit was to their location in Eau Claire. Terrible service. The restaurant was almost entirely empty and it took them forever to greet us, seat us, bring us water and come to take our small order for coffee and pie.  This was despite the fact that we told them we were somewhat time challenged.  If you can believe it, they took so long that we had to get up and leave before we could even place our coffee and pie order. They did not even notice.  Still, when hearing that their DeForest location was open, we were looking forward to going.  But before leaving to visit them at lunch today, we checked Yelp and were concerned about the reports of challenging service at this new location.  But our concerns were unfounded. At least on our visit today, whatever service challenges may have occurred in the past, were absent today.  We got there just before the lunch crowd arrived - - 11:45 AM - - and were greeted and seated promptly and offered drinks. Our waitress was very polite and thoughtful. Our food, as usual, was pretty good. Sandwiches, a breakfast dish, a fried shrimp special, a meatloaf dinner, etc. All were solid and fairly priced. Of course, the pie was dynamite.  One downside was that a number of the pies had already sold out.  These were the more popular ones. Given their popularity, I would have hoped they would have made plenty particularly given the Easter weekend.   But there were plenty of other choices.    The space is nice, brightly lit and handicap accessible.  The waitresses wear traditional Norwegian garb, which is cute and adds to the fun vibe.  Tip--if you want a whole pie to take home, there is a $6 deposit for the pie tin.  Definitely worth a stop. Uff da!  See you there!"}
{"text":"This is a cute, cute place! Love that they have vegetarian and gluten free options!  Service was great! I felt like I was back in Norway."}
{"text":"Nice spot here. Great pie, very good selection. Service was good and attentive.  Food took a little bit to get to the table, but that's because it was made fresh and to order. Eggs were done correctly and were tasty. Corned beef hash was spot on. Our table enjoyed our lunch, hope you do as well!"}
{"text":"The wife and I decided to stop here today after hearing great things about their desserts and pies. Very nice looking building from the outside with a lot of cars in the parking lot.  Seemed like they were a busy place or the place to be in Deforest.  Soon as you walk in there is pies and desserts everywhere and they look amazing. They are all homemade by a staff of women that come in early everyday. I had the Monte Cristo Benedict for lunch and my wife had a cranberry turkey Swiss sandwich that came served with a unique mustard as a side.  Mustard was awesome....   Two very tasty dishes that we would consider having again.  For dessert we had the banana cream pie along with death by chocolate cream pie both award-winning Blue Ribbon desserts. And man were they good.  I'd say if you got a sweet tooth or if you're in the neighborhood for a nice home cooked meal this is the place to come in a small town of DeForest Wisconsin. Nice big building, big restaurant, clean, good service, and most importantly good food."}
{"text":"Breakfast was excellent, pancakes were the best we've had in a while and everything tasted homemade.  The service was top notch, and the authentic Nordic Wisconsin decor really added to the experience.   Fun place!"}
{"text":"Decent comfort food. Their lefse wraps and sour cream pies are great but I haven't had great experiences outside those items."}
{"text":"I've been here I believe 3 times. Each time it has been awful. I just don't understand how people can mess up breakfast food! The waiter brought me the wrong food, said it wasn't mine. He took it and brought it back AGAIN. I said I didn't order this. At that point we had been waiting almost an hour for our food so I said I'd just eat it since everyone else was already eating and I was hungry. I want this place to do good but I don't see myself ever going back."}
{"text":"What a complete train wreck.  We met for dinner on a Saturday night and it was a disaster from start to finish.  Where do I begin.  Server had no idea about the menu and the ordering was a foreshadowing to the meal.  He came back about 10 minutes later and said that they were out of the soup we ordered, but \"working on it\".  I said I would take a different soup which arrived right before the entrees.  Salad was served 60 seconds before the meal and he just looked at the guest who then had to move his salad to the side awkwardly.  Oh the entrees.  A Reuben sandwich with no 1000 Island dressing.  A Denver omelette with no eggs in it?  How is this even possible?  Then another staff member told us they would comp the omelette after bringing back the same plate with eggs thrown on.  Of course the omelette was still on the bill at the end of the night.  Errors on the bill abounded.  Ok surely the pie must be good right?  Um, nope.  Had the butterscotch pie and it tasted like it came out of a box.  Verified by three of us.  Didn't even finish it.    Never was a plate cleared from the table - they just kept stacking up throughout the night.  The food was mediocre to average and the service was some of the worst I have ever seen.  If they don't change there is no way this place will survive."}
{"text":"I've been stopping at the Osseo location when visiting my daughter who was going to college in Minnesota. She graduated this past May so I was pleasantly surprised to discover the newest Nook so much closer to our homes in Wisconsin and Illinois. We saw the sign on 90/94 (don't know how I missed it for so long) and stopped in for lunch. Had to have a lefse wrap-I got the BLT and my adventurous daughter got the smelt lefse wrap. Both were delicious and came with waffle fries. Very filling so we took our pie to go. I recommend the cherry, because it was filled with real fruit and very little \"pie goo.\" Also delicious was their strawberry lemonade. We will definitely be back many times!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was busy when we arrived due to a local father/daughter dance. Waited about 10 minutes for a table and then the wait really began. Couples that came in after us had waitresses within minutes but no one stopped at out table. Finally after 20 minutes I stopped a waitress and asked if she had our table. She seemed perplexed and said she would find out who our waitress was. Another 5 minutes passed and she came back and asked if we wanted something to drink, never introducing herself. Didn't tell us of any dinner specials and they had several. Linda wasn't about to let her escape without both a drink and dinner order. We both ordered the same meal, chicken strips and a cup of chicken rice soup. The soup was very good, the chicken strips were crispy but nothing outstanding. Even had to ask for any dipping sauce after they were delivered to the table. When it was time to order dessert, the apple pie Linda wanted was not available so she settled for a different variety which was so/so. I guess I can say we've been there once but are in no hurry to return."}
{"text":"A surprising gem on Main street.  This was my first time here.  Please don't expect fast service.  It is a diner with great pie.  Take it for what it is.    Now, the pie...so many options, so many delicious choices.  Keep in mind there are seasonal options as well, so pace yourself.    The food is okay.  There isn't anything that really stands out.  So just save the room for the pie.  So MUCH pie!  Is my review even comprehensible?  I am in full pie coma....."}
{"text":"Have wanted to stop for awhile now and finally had a chance. I ordered the shrimp platter and my husband ordered the lefse wrap. And of course we had to order pie. I had the peanut butter and my husband had the rhubarb crisp. We were very happy with our food. It tasted great and it was quick to get. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 star is because of the server. I'm not sure if he was new or not but he definitely didn't seem comfortable in his position. He also didn't mention any of the dinner specials.  Overall I would come back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful menu and tons of pies options!! The Rueben was the best that we've ever had!"}
{"text":"Visited based on a friend's recommendation who has visited before. The food was good and service good, but the main draw of pie was disappointing. Had the coconut cream and it just wasn't as good as I expected. Plus the wait staff have definitely been trained to push the pie. Our server was back at our table at least five times about the pie."}
{"text":"I would only recommend this place for pie.  I have been for breakfast 3 times food is average at best and service and management is bad."}
{"text":"Pie and coffee-that's what you order.  I just saved you about $10 per person.  Let's rewind.  This installment of the iconic franchise has its heart in the right place.  Wholesome and friendly staff make every effort to make you feel like a guest-a welcome change from the sneering and entitled waitstaff which is all too often the norm in Madison and many other college towns.  I ordered the nightly special-Swedish meatballs, which arrived a little later than it should have, with a range of temperature gradients depending on each item.  A tennis ball sized serving of tepid mashed potatoes was done no favors by a flavorless runny gravy.  Next to it was a generous helping of....stuffing?  Tasted like it was Sysco-approved and covered with said gravy.  For the carb averse, you've already veered far from your comfort zone.  A small serving of mixed vegetables had been nuked for maybe thirty seconds, leaving pockets of cooler temperatures.  The meatballs themselves were good, but not worthy of the meal's total expense of $8.99.  I would recommend finding a table close to the kitchen, where the food has less time to cool after being whisked to its destination."}
{"text":"I really am passing by on our way to minnesota. Just off the highway took mins excellent choice. Very clean food was good  pie are excellent. Chances are you'll find lots of Norwegian people  can't have everything.  Yes I am Swedish"}
{"text":"If it was for the food alone it would be 4 to 5 stars the food is excellent and the pies are amazing unfortunately every time we been there we've had service issues they seem to be getting better but just things like getting a order of cheese curds and having them be cold and coming out 2 minutes before main entrees having to ask 3 times for my son's toast kids meals come with cookies of the 4 times we been there had to ask for them 2 times went Sunday ordered chicken fried steak it was great but it came soup which I had to ask because the waitress forgot very slow to come see if meal is okay 80% through entees by the time you see her again we will keep trying though liked everything I've had lefse and homemade bread are excellent and the pies are some of the best I've ever had if they could work out the kinks it could be 5 stars"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the time for food to get to the table is extremely slow. It does not seem to matter what time you are there, the kitchen needs to change something it is doing because it is slow. The Norwegian pancakes are excellent, but sandwiches and other things or just OK. Entrance and waiting area are set up poorly."}
{"text":"Really was hoping this restaurant would be good as DeForest needs more places like this.  After several Sunday morning visits I've had the following consistent experiences:  Hostess was also the cashier.  One person doing both jobs creates long waits & is no fun for that employee.  Second, do a better job cleaning off the tables.  Service during the meal was slow.  Waitresses were heard apologizing at most of the tables.  Fix this before the locals stop coming."}
{"text":"Food was OK. I ordered the Swedish pancakes and they were alright. My husband and the lufske stuffed omelet and he thought it was good. I tried the pecan stout pie and didn't care for it. It didn't seem like it was formed up. Our waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want to get great pies. Have tried both cream pies and fruit pies and they are terrific. Just as good as the original location in Osseo."}
{"text":"This place is good for pie only. Went for breakfast today and stood at the front while the hostess was trying to do everything she could to bus tables, answer phones, check for full pies (request from phone call) while the manager walked by and looked at us multiple times without saying anything.  Finally, I asked her whether we could sit.    After ordering a very basic meal of eggs, hash browns, and toast: it took 38 minutes for the food to come.  When it did, it clearly was sitting for awhile as the bread was soggy and cold, the eggs were luke warm, and the bacon was fatty.  My son's eggs had jelly below them on the plate and inedible.  We didn't have continued time to wait so we didn't ask for new ones, he just didn't eat.  This is the 4th time we have tried this place and it is always slow.    The pie is good though!"}
{"text":"Bad food... bad service... bad experiences... waited 40 minutes just for our check once... another time they brought out my breakfast hasbrowns (missing from my breakfast plate) with our check....1.5 hours after ordering originally.... don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This was the first time we were there. The service was slow and our soup arrived lukewarm. Both my husband and I ordered our meals grilled and they came to the table fried. I did not receive my side dish. The manager came over and said she could remake the meals. We did not have the time to wait. The waitress was flustered and avoided our table. She brought the check and did not ask if we wanted dessert.  When I went to pay the manager did not apologize or acknowledge the error. We spent an hour and a half in the restaurant for lunch. We will never return."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of De Forest (long time former resident), I'm a fan of Norske-ism in general (I am one), and who doesn't like pie?   De Forest is a town without a downtown, or town square, of any kind. There's just a Main St. running from end to end. Norske Nook has positioned itself in the closest thing to it, near the library, the big Lutheran church, and the bowling alley. It sits high on a ridge, majestically overlooking all its neighbors.   It's a nicely constructed building, but not particularly Norse looking. Nicely landscaped and ample parking. Spacious inside, but not quaint. The big electronic screen menu behind the hostess stand is oddly out of place here. The waitresses wear ill-fitting vaguely Norse-esque outfits, and it gives the overall impression of a Denny's trying to be Norwegian for a day.  The food will appeal to the Denny's crowd. It isn't particularly Norwegian except for throwing some lingonberries in here and there, some Scandinavian-ish meatballs, etc. It's basic unremarkable filling food in generous quantity. The waitstaff and hostesses aren't particularly skilled or attentive in their jobs. The much-touted pie comes in many varieties but was not outstanding in any way (we tried three varieties).  Why four stars? Because you can't beat the friendliness or the vibe of De Forest. It almost doesn't matter about the rest of it. A cold rainy spring Sunday and recovery from minor surgery called for comfort food, and that's exactly what we got. I'd definitely go again for the basic, bland heaping plate of open face meat of choice with mashed potatoes and gravy on a day like that."}
{"text":"YUM.  Comfort food at it's very finest. My mom and I visited this past weekend, on a cold and rainy afternoon. On walking into the bright and welcoming entryway, the wonderful smell of Norwegian meatballs and other specialties are the first thing to greet you. The next thing you see are the amazing pies and cookies in the cold case. I knew at that moment that one piece of pie wasn't going to be enough. And I was super excited about that.  It seems that the feedback has been taken, and while there is a slight overlap between the \"let me in to eat\" and the \"just give me pie\" lines, it wasn't anything serious and the hostess was friendly and smiley. We were seated immediately and when we requested a table near the window it was no problem.  It also seems that the issues with table service are being smoothed out, though a bit more training wouldn't be a bad idea. Our waitress was very kind and friendly, but the service was still rather slow (it was busy), and we needed to repeat ourselves on a few occasions (nothing major). My mom had the roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy, which was huge and smelled amazing. I had the corned beef hash and eggs which was exceptional (and I got gluten free toast for a .99 upcharge! Win!). Both of our meals were warm and comforting - exactly what we needed.  Now the pie...ohhhh the pie. I love pie. Pie is everything. I had two kinds because I have no self control. The butterscotch pie was incredible, clearly homemade, and completely delicious. I also ordered the coconut pie. The coconut was a bit disappointing, to be honest (i have a very high bar) - the filling was pretty flavorless and the topping was overwhelmingly sweet. That's ok though. My mom ordered the lingonberry sour cream - and was served the raspberry by accident - our waitress brought the correct one out, and we kept the raspberry one at no charge. The lingonberry was kind of sour, but we still took all the leftovers home.   Great experience, will return!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to NN to celebrate my grandpa's 85th birthday. Many of us have had subpar meals there before, but we figured it was worth another try because the pie alone is worth the trip. The pie is the only reason they aren't getting 1 star from me.  There were many things wrong with our meal today:  -flour lumps in the gravy -toast that was barely toasted  -soggy hashbrowns, way undercooked  -weak coffee -cold fried cheese curds   In the past, we have experienced: a pie that was liquid inside, being told the mushrooms were fresh when they are actually canned, and an extremely dry Denver Wrap.  This time, the kicker was that my grandpa was supposed to get a free piece of pie for his birthday. He wouldn't have ordered one otherwise, but he did because it was free. At the register, though, they were unable to comp the pie without a manager. My dad waited 10-15 min. while an employee looked for a manager, but they weren't able to find one. We ended up paying for a $6 piece of pie that we wouldn't have ordered otherwise.   They should get rid of this manager-only policy if they can't ensure a manager will be around at all times.   To end on a positive note, my omelet was pretty good (although it came without the hollandaise I ordered), the lingonberry pie was awesome, and our waitress could not have been sweeter if she tried.  TL;DR:   Don't eat a meal here, just order pie to go."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch (and pie of course). Service was very friendly and attentive. The three of us shared two sandwiches (Reuben and a lefse wrap) and we each had a different slice of pie. Food was all good, although the Reuben was the better choice of the two sandwiches. The side of chili and coffee could have been a bit hotter, but otherwise fine. All pies got thumbs up.   We had no trouble with service at all, although it took a while to pay the bill, as diners had to jockey with those looking for take out bakery items at the cash register. So nice having a new outpost of this legendary place so close to Madison."}
{"text":"I wish it would be possible to give zero stars. Horrible service! No one took our order, waited and waited and then had to beg for someone to take our order and give us a coffee refill.  Beg.  No one checked up on us. Finally had to flag down another server to find out what was going on and check on our food. When the food eventually came, they and had forgot part of my order.  Horrible!!!!!!!!! Worst service ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Updated 6/29/16.  We were having our house carpeted and since it was difficult to be in the house I decided to try a takeout breakfast and slice of pie.  I set my pie aside and ate my breakfast which was a biscuit, scrambled eggs and corn beef hash.  I was disappointed that I did not have any plastic ware or condiments.  After one bite out of the biscuit I decided to wait until I could get back into my house to add some jelly or butter as it was too dry to eat plain.  After eating my breakfast, which could have used a little salt and pepper, I decided to take a bite of the pie which was in a separate takeout bag.  Low and behold inside that takeout bag was my condiments.  So, I have jelly to finish my biscuit and  D&P that I could have used on my eggs.  There was also utensils, catsup/mustard/napkin, sweetener and mayo with a moist towelette.  They had me covered well so next time I will be sure to check all my take out bags before starting to eat.   UPDATED ABOVE We stopped in for our first time today.  We arrived a little after 11 and had a 20 minute wait.  My husband had the special-biscuit and chicken and he said it was very good.  I had an egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms and it was tasty.  Our friends had the chef salad and a patty meld with bacon and potato soup and they both said their food was very good.  The waitress brought out table free lefse with a cinnamon sugar mix to sprinkle on.  She said it was to enjoy while we waited for our food, which was about a 20-25 minute wait.  The service was great with coffee and water getting replenished often.  A cherry pie was shared and the comment was that it was just as good as the cherry pie in Door Co. At White Gull Inn.  Another had the banana cream pie and had to get a box to take the rest home as it was too big for one person to finish.  A couple of weeks ago my husband bought a banana cream pie and paid $29 for the pie and tin.  You can bring the tin back and then you do not get charged again for a tin, or you can just being the tin back and get reimbursed.    There were empty tables and we were aware that they were seating people as the kitchen allowed.  We had a pleasant experience and will be back."}
{"text":"The worst food my family has ever eaten! Tasted like hospital food very bland. Had the hot beef sandwich, fish. We didn't even take home leftovers. Also the choc cream pie was like jiggle jello not even creamy! Save ur money."}
{"text":"Wonderful, it's the best breakfast I've had in a long time, the only reason I didn't give it five stars was the service was a little slow but every thing else was great will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The pie is top tier to be sure. The entrees are adequate. However, the country music they play at this location really soured a recent visit with my family. The dining experience was marred as we were assaulted with lyrics such as \"God is great and beer is good. \""}
{"text":"We are fans of the Osseo location and love pie so we were pretty excited for the DeForest location to open. We've been there twice now and have been pretty disappointed both times. Today we stopped in with some friends for lunch. We were surprised that the place wasn't crowded at noon on a Sunday but we soon learned why. We sat down and my husband left the table briefly- the server came by and asked about drinks- I asked for a water and a coffee for my husband. She returned as the rest of our party arrived with a tray of waters but no coffee. We waited a long time for her to take our orders and then another long time to get our meals. She brought out all of the food separately so some people were served long before others. I had a salad (the only thing that didn't need to be cooked) which was brought out last- it was pretty obvious the server had forgotten about it. So everyone else sat waiting awkwardly (even though I told them to go ahead and start without me) for me to be served, so their meals were cold by the time they started eating. Unfortunately the food was not worth the wait and was mediocre at best. But we figured hey, who cares?! We're here for the pie! Well....our server showed up with our checks and we had to tell her we weren't done and would like dessert. Then she disappeared for 10 min before returning to take our orders and it was another 15-20 min before she brought the pie. Of course everyone had been served theirs but me and then she finally tells me they were out of the kind I'd ordered. So I quickly selected another one. Sadly, the pie was just ok but not great. My chocolate mint pie tasted like warm melted ice cream, for example. During the entire meal our waters were never refilled and we ended up being there over 2 hours because service was so slow (and it was not crowded at all). I was sad because we'd so been looking forward to the opening of this location but it turns out it is very poorly managed and if they don't improve I don't think they will last long. There are better places to get pie in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Go for the pie...That's about it. Service was awful...long wait to be seated (they weren't busy at all), the girl at the counter didn't even greet my husband and I and her manager had to tell her to seat us. Ordered food and waited over 30 min for it to come to table. Have heard great things about the Osseo location, sad that DeForest location is sub par."}
{"text":"Just have to give a shout out to our new favorite restaurant on the east side of Madison. I've eaten at the original Norske Nook in Osseo several times on my way between St. Paul and Madison and enjoyed it. I was delighted to hear they opened up a branch near Madison. We tried it out tonight and the food was delicious. My husband had the hot turkey commercial and I tried the salmon lefse wrap. I chose the roasted pepper soup for my side and upgraded the coleslaw to fruit. The soup was full of ground beef and rice and would have made a satisfying meal in itself in a larger portion. I eat a lot of salmon for health reasons, so when I say it's some of the tastiest I've eaten in quite a while, you know it's out of the ordinary.  I had to finish my meal with a piece of homemade pie because it's what they're famous for, but how to choose? When I saw that they had sour cream pies in a variety of flavors, I knew I had to try one. I enjoy sour cream raisin pie - except for the raisins - and I've often wished someone would make another version.  Their strawberry sour cream pie, made with fresh, local strawberries, is scrumptious. The sour cream gives it a slight tang and the strawberries give it a pretty pink color.  The one thing I wish they would improve is processing people coming in or paying on the way out at the front. There is only one cash register and when we arrived on a Sun. evening, the person running it was trying to take to-go orders, take money from customers who were done eating and greet new customers like us. On the way out, we had to wait quite a while for her to handle some special request that I think was a to-go order before someone realized I was there to pay our bill. The manager was cool about processing the Yelp voucher we bought on my phone after we arrived, however. I think several of the staff were new and I suspect Sun. night is usually a slow time and therefore a good time to break in new employees, so I'm sure that will get better. We'll definitely be back on a Fri. or Sat. night to check it out soon."}
{"text":"Gave them a 2 rating because the pies are pretty good. The service is horrible. Been there two times and it took 90 minutes to eat which did not include the wait.  Gave them one last chance and they said there was a 10 min wait.  30 minutes later we were still waiting. Walked out.    The management needs to be changed.  Can't imagine they will stay in business very much longer in Deforest if this continues.  What a shame."}
{"text":"This was our second and last time going to this restaurant. From the time we walked in on a Saturday night until the time we got our food (there was a 5 minute wait) it was 40 minutes. The service was terrible. The table we sat at had dirty salt and pepper shakers, as well as there special seasoning had God knows what on it. The flip menu had food hanging on it. I had blueberry pie, the blueberries were about the size of a grain of rice, so it was probably made with canned blueberries. Needless to say we will not be back ever again."}
{"text":"Had the French Toast Grain Bread Awesome.  The Raison Creme Merengue was as always to die for.  Try the Patio"}
{"text":"Just stopped into Norske Nook to buy a pie. When we came in there was no one at the hostess stand and 2 registers open. Unsure as to which register to go to, we opted for the first one. The young woman working the other one did not offer to help anyone, just waited for people to get impatient and go over to her.  Then who I can only assume was the manager came over and said to the young women working behind the counter, \"Why are there 3 people standing around and no one at the hostess stand?\". She then closed down the second register to do something. Never once did she or anyone else address the crowd that was forming.  After 10 minutes the 2nd register reopens, but they did not ask who was next, just opened and waited to help someone.  When we walked in, there was one person in front of us ordering slices of pie. 25 minutes later we finally left with our pie & there was a line at least 6-8 parties deep behind us. Another problem, the pies don't have tags listing what they are and they have nothing to look at to tell you what pies are available. Also, the price for pies is listed $21.99-$25.99 (I think), but then when they ring you up they tell you they are charging you another $6.00 pie Tim deposit.  After that whole fiasco we are not sure if we want to go back to eat. I really hope they get there stuff together, they aren't off to a good start. Also, maybe they should start responding to the reviews on here."}
{"text":"Note: I'm reviewing the pie only. I mean, it's really all about the pie anyway, right??  Basically, if you can bake a decent fruit pie, your own pie is undoubtably better than those at Norske Nook. If you struggle with merengue or cream pies (I do), don't feel like making a whole candy pie, etc., then try those varieties. But hands down, I prefer my own fruit fillings and crust ... and I usually use the Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust! I know the Nook's pie crust is homemade so \"on paper\" they've got me beat, but their pie crust is not buttery or flaky like my grandmother's or mother-in-law's. It's dry, flavorless crust with a load of sugar sprinkled on top.   Points for pie slice size, though - HUGE pieces."}
{"text":"First visit at this NN. Friendly staff. Had rasp chocolate coffee...too sweet but enjoy they offer a flavored coffee. I had the peanut butter chocolate pie and it wasnt the best Ive had from them...taste was blah and texture was a bit runny. Took a blueberry pie home which was delicious."}
{"text":"I have to say that I hate when a place relies on their name only. We had breakfast and the Norske Nook and it was just ok. I have worked in several restaurants in my career and I could clearly see what was happening here. The kitchen staff is highly unorganized. There is no reason why a plate of fried eggs, hashbrowns and toast should take 40-60 minutes from the time ordered till it reaches the table, only to discover the order is not complete. When paying my bill, I witnessed what appeared to be the manager assisting the cook staff with triaging and plating of the orders. The servers were moving and taking care of the guests, but I think the real issue here is what is happening back in the kitchen. Your kitchen will make or break you. Maybe it was an off day but on a Sunday you should have your strongest chef/cook working and not what appeared to be an unorganized mess. The food was okay, but their timing needs work! Stick to pie making."}
{"text":"Yum yum lots of options with pies!  Great service and awesome breakfast food. Wraps are good, benedicts and also daily breakfast specials.  Can't leave without having pie."}
{"text":"Tried this place a few times.  Stale lefse each time. Tight seating.   Service was good,  but the food dissapointing.  Really want to like this place but consistently sub-mediocre.  Pie was good. Each time it was busy though so people seem to disagree with me."}
