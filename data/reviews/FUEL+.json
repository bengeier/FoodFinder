{"text":"Love this place, I'm a huge fan ever since I discovered this place ! It's small but modern and clean. got free wi-fi, friendly staff and of course great selection of healthy food, snacks and coffee ! Great price as well..one of my favourites is energy ball and coconut oil coffee, so good !"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness - the owners here are SO LOVELY! I don't post Yelp reviews but I had to make an exception here.

I dropped by Fuel today after a late day at work - not knowing that I strolled in about an hour after they closed. Gary was cleaning up but still took the time to introduce himself, and kindly offered to still serve me something - despite the fact that everything was already cleared away. I didn't want to inconvenience him with a smoothie so I tried the 3 protein balls for $2.75 option. I got two chocolate peanut butter and one cinnamon - DELICIOUS! The chocolate peanut butter one in particular was perfect - the texture was spot on, had just the right amount of chewy goodness, the peanut butter wasn't too sweet or overwhelming (which I find is pretty common with PB desserts), and just one makes a very satisfying snack. I'm looking forward to coming back (when it's actually open!) to try their famous smoothies.

I just want to say that as a health food fanatic, I've been to many juice/smoothie places in Toronto, and no matter how great the products are, it's how you're treated as a customer that completes the whole experience. The owners at Fuel clearly love what they do, and are genuine in their enthusiasm when sharing this joy with customers. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I should probably mention I've only been here ONCE and very briefly.

I'd just finished my training session at my nearby gym, and forgot to bring my own protein shake. I headed down to my favourite nearby juicery (Fresh Juice) which was closed (surprisingly). Anyways, I backtracked to Fuel+ which I only went to because it was conveniently a minute's walk away.

And can I just say, wow! 
The staff were so friendly I felt like I was actually conversing with friends. They make you feel welcome and as if helping you was the best part of their day, very patient and informative when I was indecisive and curious about which protein shake would be best to get. Honest, took me a good five minutes to decide, but they were really helpful. 
I probably dread the protein shake part more than the workout part, but theirs tasted nothing like whey. 

Thanks for the hospitality guys!"}
{"text":"WOW!
What a great time I had at Fuel+!  A girlfriend of mine and I stopped by this fabulous cafe/ shop in The Village and could not be more impressed not only by the wonderful service that I received and the scrumptious treats they had but the coffee was fantastic! Best in the city! 
I got a 'Flourless Cashew Cookie' by 'Sweets From The Earth' and an amazingly smooth, mid-full-bodied almond milk cappuccino, coffee roasted by a local Toronto business called 23 Degrees Roastery. My girlfriend got a 2 Peanut Butter Fuel Balls made in house at Fuel+ and a rich, chocolatly, full-bodied cup of the drip 'Liquid Mettle'.

Sharing with all my friends!!! I highly recommend this wonderful NEW hot spot in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Went to this place every single morning while in town. Great coffee, food and ingredients. Butter coffee, chai latte and protein balls were our favorites. Also had their juices and liked a lot. Friendly staff, got to talk to the owners.., highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had my first butter coffee. Tastes like a smooth AmericanoLatte-ish. Met the owner who is as passionate and shared great info. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cozy little shop with much to offer.

Affordable, healthier and much better quality than any Starbucks or Tim Horton's can offer.

A great spot to get out of the cold. I recommend getting the hot chocolate. Not only is it delightfully delicious, but it is made with fair trade ingredients, all natural and guilt free."}
{"text":"Loved the enthusiasm of the staff working! I got the beet chocolate drink and it's absolutely delicious! Apparently a favourite of many! I checked in for the fuel ball (the peanut butter chocolate chip one is delicious!) with no hassle. In fact, they were so happy that I wanted to give it a try. Very satisfied with the recommended choice.

Apparently their butter coffee is very good! (Or the coconut coffee for those with dairy allergies). I'm coming back to try next time.

Excellent service and even better drinks!"}
{"text":"As a Holistic Nutritionist, I am always looking for healthy spots in the city. As a foodie and lover of truly cool spots, sometimes the combo of both worlds can be hard to find. 

Fuel + is definitely an exception! Upon arriving, the team was super welcoming and helpful in guiding us with the menu decision making. 

My biz partner and I both had the Spicy Ginger Chai and it was UNREAL! Also tried the Fuel balls which were the perfect snack. 

Prices are more than fair and the quality of what you get is well worth it. 

It was a little chilly in there, but they had a heater and moved it right next to where we were sitting to keep us warm. 

You could tell they really make an effort to get to know their customers, and coming from a customer service background - it means the world and makes such a huge difference. 

Thanks so much! Even though it's out of the way for me, I will def hit it up again as much as I can. Great spot! 

Oh and free wifi!"}
{"text":"This review is based almost solely on the coffee. I want to like their coffee, I really really do. The owners are super nice and they use organic milks, locally roasted, fair trade beans, and their food options are great for the vegan and/or gluten-avoidant person in your life. But the coffee just isn't that good- I can get the same from Sbucks - bland and yet bitter. 
So sorry. The food should be reviewed separately as I've enjoyed a number of (very expensive for small portions) items."}
{"text":"An alright healthy place for some raw snacks and healthy smoothies. The Cappuccino is just okay, the green smoothie had more ice than any taste, so basically the smoothie tastes like water rather than a smoothie with green ingredients ."}
{"text":"I frequent Fuel + often. I think of it as my local, but rather than a pint of beer, I'd rather drink their unique drinks. 

My fave drink at Fuel + is by far Kombocha. Its a fermented black tea, somewhat effervescent and is the absolute best pro-biotic there is.

I've always been afraid of protein shakes, the GI problems from whey protein shakes were always unpleasant. The smoothies have a scoop of vegan protein powder which I was surprised to find kept me very full for a long time. And the selection is quite unique. 

And if you like Ginger Ale, Fuel + makes their own on site. After your first sip, you will realize that this is what Ginger Ale should taste like. 

The staff are very friendly and quite knowledgeable about what is offered.

A nice alternative to have in the Church/Wellesley neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Today, I finally had a chance to visit this wonderful shop.  Chester is sooo nice and really funny.  Chats with all his customers and makes them feel special.  He made my Coconut Butter Iced Coffee, which I have to say is absolutely delicious, an island party in my mouth!!!!  I also got the PB Breakfast protein bowl and let's just say, it made my day! I really will have to make a point to visit this spot once in a while because their goodies are that good.  I also got the Fuel Balls which are such a great treat!!!  Thank you for your wonderful shop!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. 
Great coffee, great healthy snacks, great staff, and the most friendly owners ever! They frequently change their menu and the items they sell, which makes it an extra treat when I stop by - there's always something new! Chester and Gary also put a lot of work into Fuel+ and it's evident from the front of their store (secure dog leash clip) to the back (they have lockers for runners).  I just wish Fuel+ was on every corner of the city (fortunately for me, they're in my hood)!"}
{"text":"Can't recommend this place enough. The staff were super friendly and extremely knowledgeable. I came in inquiring about the butter coffee and could not be more impressed. The coffee was some of the best I've ever had. Great service, welcoming environment and amazing, amazing coffee. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee and never let down! Unlike other  North American coffees which are usually watered down, the coffee here is amazing!!! Soy Latte!! Not to mention the great staff!!"}
{"text":"fantastic little place in the Village
Such a wide range of healthy options in smoothies/juices!!
A true gem and great service also!!"}
{"text":"So i have seen their advertisements on twitter and facebook, I went on their webste to see what they have to offer. I do enjoy trying new healthy vegan and juice bar type places, but what actually drew me more to this cafe was the fact that they serve butter coffee. For awile I have heard about butter coffee from one of my trainers and I have been looking for grass fed butter which I haven't found yet. Regardless I decided to pay a visit. it's a quaint little store front with the menu all laid out via screens. The first time I went I ordered the butter coffee and the fuel balls, my cashier was ok, she served me and was cordial. I went back recently and the next time around my server told me about their app were you can receive points and other items of free interest with check ins and such. I have yet to try their food or their smoothies. When I do, I will surely make a addendum to this review."}
{"text":"I love their protein shakes! It is a perfect solution to a hot hungry day. You are filled up with good nutrients and cooled down at the same time. Service is super friendly as everyone is very relaxed, you don't see that in Toronto very much! Drinks run around ~$8 and I got a free energy ball for checking in using Yelp app! Yay for freebies."}
{"text":"Amazing shakes and service.If your a smoothie junkie,best place to go.Try their breakfast shakes"}
{"text":"First, let me say: I like their food and their coffee -- it's healthy and tastes good.

BUT, my issue is not with their food...

I just ordered from this location via Uber Eats. I do this relatively frequently. Unfortunately, and for the second time, even though I paid an extra $3 for a glass jar for my butter coffee, they instead gave me a plastic drink container. This time I didn't just lose the jar (and the $3), but I lost the drink as well, since the plastic container could not stand up to the movement in the packed delivery bag. What I got, as a result, was a coffee-soaked bag, no drink and no glass jar.

Wanting to find out how they could completely skip the glass jar for the second time in a row, I actually called Fuel+ (rather than just Uber support) to see what happened. By their own admission, they just didn't look closely at the order. They didn't really seem to care, either.

I understand that I can call Uber, and that I'll likely get a refund for the jar and the missing coffee, but it's not just the money; it's the inconvenience, the lack of attention and the lack of care that will prevent me from going back. Not cool."}
{"text":"Came here for coffee with a friend who is vegan and who also can't eat soy or  gluten - I searched for a place that offers almond milk.  We tried the pumpkin chai latte after seeing that it was made with real pumpkin - what a treat!  Best pumpkin latte I've had, much better than the big chains.  The fuel balls are also tasty (and vegan + gluten free).  There is plenty of available seating particularly on a weeknight, and we were able to chat away for 2 hours until closing.  At first I found the refrigeration units (located toward the back where we were sitting, containing organic drinks and tubs of gelatos and ice creams) rather loud, but they actually helped keep our conversation more private - a little white noise.  

The pumpkin chai latte is only available in October - I'm definitely planning on coming back for at least one more.  Then after that, I'll have to try their ginger ale!"}
{"text":"It would be so much better if the staff member that was there when I visited actually talked to you, the customer, rather than some guy who was flirting with him and didn't appear to be a customer.  I felt like I was cockblocking someone.

Another tip, when you hand someone a coffee, face them, don't pass it off to the side in a rush to get back to your visitor. He doesn't appear to be going anywhere."}
{"text":"Really good Fresh smoothies. No added BS. They were closing up when I came in on Labor day, and they still served me. Pretty awesome, will be one of my spots in the city for sure. How did I not step in this place before?"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to drop by FUEL+ for quite a while, and finally managed to do so last Sunday.

Stepping inside, the first thing I noticed was the amount of seating - perfect for getting some work done while you enjoy a coffee. They even have power outlets so you can recharge! There was a snack bar by the espresso machine and some delicious looking wraps and salads in the fridge.

I ordered an americano and was delighted to hear that they charge the same price, regardless of cup size. I also scored a free cinnamon fuel ball by checking in on Yelp and it was delicious!

I will be back soon to try some more delicious food and drink options. Their breakfast wraps look amazing too!"}
{"text":"Had one of the yummiest americanos I've had yet! Kudos to them for having soy milk and organic milk/cream, as well as alternative options to white sugar (organic honey, stevia and cane sugar) plus plenty of healthy options for yums AND friendly professional service. 

Can the list go on? 

Maybe next time when I go back and try something else :D

But yeah, this ones a keeper."}
{"text":"FUEL+ is my favourite café and protein bar in the whole city, and probably of all time. The service is amazing, the shakes are healthy and delicious, and I always feel great after eating here. I'm so glad that this place is on my walk to/from work and the gym!"}
{"text":"I got the green smoothie bowl and it was delicious! You get 5 servings of greens, although I do wish the blueberries that were used as a topping were fresh (seemed like they were previously frozen), but it was still delicious. The staff was also very friendly and service was great."}
{"text":"A very unique start up. I like their balls (protein balls), 3 for $2.50. I frequently stop by for their balls when I am between clients and need something to hold me over to the next meal. The village has had a few start ups that went on to do very well, and I think this may be another winner.  Unfortunately our current city counselor does little to support the business in the area. Church street is very rough and full of sink holes. It was closed down for most of 2014. If that didn't kill off your business I'm sure she got more in mind for us this year. Maybe more graffiti style art or another summer closure of church street for repairs. Like most business can handle two summers of massive construction.

One good thing about her poor planning, lots of business rental opportunities on Church Street."}
{"text":"Coffee review

I should mention to start that I don't think that I'm in the target market for this place... it seems  to be targeted towards vegans/ vegetarians, and I'm a borderline carnivore. 

Ordered a large cappuccino. First of all it was really expensive... perhaps the most expensive cappuccino I've had in Toronto.. about $5.6 after tax. But the the quality did not match the high price. It was okay, but nothing special. Even if I'd paid a more reasonable price, I'd still say that this was an average cup of coffee. There was no latte art either... just a wad of foam (not microfoam) on the top. I should mention that I came on a Sunday, so I'm not sure if the main barista was on duty (I had a lady serving me).

I was going to give 2 stars, but I got a free fuel ball for checking in on yelp, so I'll up the rating to 3 (even though I didn't really like the fuel ball)

Surprised this place has a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff are amazing and incredibly friendly and knowledgable. The fuel balls are especially delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing little cafe close to my apartment. Awesome vegan and gluten free options, and the shakes are a MUST! Decent selection of grocery items in the back too, including the vegan protein I take which is a plus. Highly recommend a visit to fuel plus!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast one morning when on a business trip. I had looked for a place to get a healthy breakfast in Toronto (after days of eating random stuff on the road) and this looked promising. I was greeted cheerfully as soon as I walked in, by a guy I think may have been the owner. He was super friendly and told me about their food philosophy and the butter coffee as I waited for my order. I ordered a breakfast smoothie (berry) and it was delicious and filling; I had that and an apple around 7:30-8 a.m. and didn't feel hungry for hours. Best of all, I felt good after consuming it and was so happy I opted for this instead of some greasy to-go breakfast. I wanted to come back for lunch or breakfast again before I left Toronto, but my schedule didn't allow it. Highly recommended and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee! Probably my favourite in town. 

Have tried the regular coffee and the espresso and both have surpassed my expectations. Why? Usually I find the coffee bitter and with a burnt after taste which normally force me to add two-3 sugars and lots of milk to soften the taste. But not here. 

The other thing that I really appreciate is that the choice of the coffee is..\"responsible\": local, organic and especially, I was told, from a sustainable source. 

The owner-manager, Chester was welcoming and took the time to explain to me the philosophy behind Fuel+. 
It was a pleasure to have a nice conversation with him. 

So, it's wrap up time: I recommend you to pay a visit to Fuel+ for a cup of coffee. And if you can, also grab a \"Fuel Ball\". It's a fresh in house specialty, all plant based and gluten free ingredients. 

Your visit is worth your money! :)"}
{"text":"The selection here is fantastic, but I definitely didn't try their best options.

If you're going the UberEats route (or equivalent), just don't order the vegan butter chicken wrap or creamy broccoli tahini salad. The wrap will likely arrive lukewarm, ushering in a mandatory visit to the microwave. If it was freshly pressed though, I could see it being yummier. The salad was not my cup of tea (the tahini dressing is more on the bitter side and it's really small), either.

ALAS, because of the promising other reviews, I will come back to try something else!"}
{"text":"One of the very few places that do butter/coconut oil coffee. So delicious and nutritious. Also tried their peanut butter shake and peanut butter chocolate bowl. Both so good! I could literally eat here everyday and never feel guilty. It is a bit pricey but you pay for what you get. High quality ingredients. Accepts all forms of payment and has wifi. I wish there were more locations throughout the city."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by Fuel+ recently and while what we had was good, I found the portion smaller than I expected for the price.

I had the green detox smoothie bowl $9.99. It's a kale, spinach, pineapple and mango smoothie, served in a bowl with some cultivated blueberries (not wild), shredded coconut and ground flax seeds. It's also supposed to come with chia seeds, but I asked them not to put any in. 

The smoothie was really smooth except for a chunk of banana I found in it (not listed as an ingredient in my smoothie bowl, so I don't know what to make of it. I'm not allergic, and I like bananas so no big deal for me). I liked the crunchiness of the shredded coconut and the nuttiness of the flax seeds. The ingredient combination was great. The bowl was on the small side though. Much smaller than I expected.

My husband had the pomegranate berry dream smoothie $6.99. I had a taste and it was good. It's much smaller than you'd get at Booster Juice or Jugo Juice though. 

The salads and sandwiches there are pre-packaged. We didn't have any. They also sell large Vega powder tubs for $54.99, which is much cheaper than the regular price at most stores, but comparable to or slightly higher than when on sale.

Staff are nice and friendly.

The place is small and cute. They have a few seats, but most people just get the stuff to go."}
{"text":"Love the place. All their food and drink options can be modified for GF, dairy free, etc and the variety is awesome. What you get truest feel like healthy fuel for your body and mind. I plan to be back in the morning!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome little coffee shop in the village.  

Great service, and a great cup-a joe, though it's much too nice to be called joe.

And the Spicy Ginger Chai Latte maybe one of my favourite drinks period.  If you like Gingery things like I do, this is a unique little drink, and great during the winter."}
{"text":"Best place to unwind and relax after a run. They got coco water, water, bananas, organic coffee, and must have fuel balls. Recommend the chocolate peanut butter ones."}
{"text":"As Jessica W. humorously - and accurately - points out, I was afraid that Fuel had shut down or that I'd run into the wrong place when I stopped by, because the venue looked like a sterile pharmacy from the outside. Once I stepped in, however, I found more than meets the eye.

Their smoothies were satisfying and fresh, and they also have some surprisingly good food offerings like their Fuel balls, which are tiny, protein-filled energy balls. Neither the smoothies nor the Fuel balls look like much on the surface, especially when you see their prices, but they are satisfying going down. The Fuel balls, in particular, should probably be viewed less as a meal than as a quick, energizing, healthy treat.

Inside, the venue is quite small and modern-looking, but there are a few small tables to sit and enjoy your treats. It is not, however, a Second Cup or Starbucks-like place where you can sit around and lounge all afternoon long without buying much of anything - which is all probably a good thing anyway."}
{"text":"Decided to take a walk around the work area and since I saw 5 stars, decided to try it.  

Overall: 3.25/5 (that's right a quarter!!!)

Service: 5/5 - barista's chat and joke with you.  

\"Food\" - well they don't have much food here, but I used the Yelp check in offer to get a fuel ball and it was not bad.  It was mango coconut, but it tasted sort of like a hybrid cookie in the shape of a mini meatball. Not bad.  I think it was healthy???

Coffee - I got an iced latte and it was like $4.50 I think.  They were very friendly as they said there was no extra charge for soy, lactose free and almond milk, which is a benefit since Starbucks charges an extra $0.50.  The coffee itself wasn't bad, but it was too much ice and not much coffee.   

Overall, will go again because of the friendly baristas, but will try the protein shake and hot coffee, but probably not the iced coffee. I ain't that rich to spend $5 on ice! lol"}
{"text":"I love this place! The guys are so nice and so patience explaining me the menu. I had kiwi detox and that is delicious!! To go with it 3 protein balls: delightful!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Didn't like their lactose free butter coffee. Energy balls were good but you can make them yourself. Staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Green goddess ($6.99) has an initial sweet taste from the juice but has a veggie aroma and leaves aweird veggie sweet bitterness on your tongue afterward. Not exactly a taste I'm used to but it's okay. The drink comes with a Vega one protien powder which is plant based instead of milk so, it is vegan friendly. I don't think the protien was fully mixed into the drink though cause I found a clump of it after finishing the drink.
Butter coffee ($3.99) does have a rich buttery taste I can identify especially the aftertaste on the tongue. The butter flavour sort of makes the bitterness of the coffee tolerable.
Every time, someone opens the door, the cold of winter goes straight through the cafe. There is no vestibule and the door closes really slow. There are approx 7 tables of seating in the cafe. Not very busy on a Sunday afternoon. No music.
As someone not into health food, this may not the best place to get a drink."}
{"text":"This place has the best green smoothies I've ever had. The Green Goddess is amazing and my go-to for an energy boost. They also have great energy balls that are surprisingly filling despite their size. I'd give this place a 5 star for the quality but their prices are quite high for a daily smoothie."}
{"text":"I came with my mom the other day looking for a hot beverage (it was freezing outside). First of all AMAZING costumer service, the two gentlemen helped us deciding which drink we wanted and patiently explained each and every drink coffee and tea or the menu. 
My mom ordered a tea and I ordered the ginger chai latte both were really really good, then we ordered the gluten free cashew cookie, delightful! 

Overall it was amazing, but what we enjoyed the most were the nice two guys in charge of the store, they were lovely."}
{"text":"I can only add to the accolades that FUEL+ has seen here on Yelp. Tried the Green Detox Bowl, Acai Berry Bowl, GF Chili - all of these were awesome. Yummy and healthy and all that good stuff. I want to have everything, everyday, forever. 

Gushing aside, I didn't really know what to expect from the bowls but I liked what I ate! Cold with slush-y like texture but oh-so-filling?! The Green Detox Bowl has 5 servings of greens... definitely sold me on that one. Picked it up right away, heh. The Chili was flavourful and warm and felt good afterwards (no sleepiness!), too! The spicy option wasn't spicy at all but I have super tolerance to spiciness so that may just be me. 

Can't wait to try the other FUEL+ offerings!"}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees. Butter coffee and peanut butter balls are killer. Very friendly staff and knowledgable. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee place with some pretty interesting coffees to try! First of all, the owner of Fuel+ is super friendly, a little quirky but he's funny and very helpful when you're standing there with a confused look on your face. I loved the atmosphere here, it was very casual, cozy, and friendly.

I only had their butter coffee so I can't really review on any of there other items on the menu. It was actually the first time I've heard of butter coffee (and this seemed to be one of their specialty drinks), but the fact that butter was in the name, I had to try it. What it is, is basically an espresso blended with butter (from what I was explained, it was grass fed butter), and MCT oil. The result? Amazing. It taste a little like a cappuccino, but it has this residual creaminess that you don't have with just milk or cream. 
Although I might not drink this on a daily basis, but I would definitely recommend it if you happen to pass by and is feeling a little adventurous, it is a pretty incredible experience for the taste buds.

They're also opening a new Fuel+ at another location in a few months, so that should be exciting!"}
{"text":"Wow.. I've walked past this a 1000 times, had no idea how good FUEL + is.. . Mango sunrise a GREAT drink! Equally impressive, the protein balls. Peanut butter EXCELLENT."}
{"text":"I got the Green Smoothie Bowl for lunch. It was icy, not blended enough (chunks of spinach, ice and banana throughout) and the blueberries on top were the frozen kind. Worst smoothie bowl I've ever had. It was very disappointing as this place has such good reviews!"}
{"text":"Had the Breakfast Oatmeal Vanilla shake and the butter coffee, both were absolutely delicious! The staff was extremely knowledgable and helpful too! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Fuel+ and appreciate it even more because i live in the neighbourhood. For me this is my emergency breakfast, after gym snack, lunch on the go or casual coffee place. They have a selection of healthy smoothies, juices, vegan wraps, salads, protein bars and handmade energy balls. The other thing I like about visiting is that the staff are very friendly, fun and seem happy to be there - and you can tell the two owners are very passionate about their business and care for the customers.

My favourites (so far):
- green goddess smoothie
- peanut butter chocolate smoothie
- peanut butter energy balls
- butter coffee
- any of the vegan wraps"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE fuel. My only wish is that I lived closer to it. 
I've been so many times and each time the staff are extremely friendly and kind. They're always patient when I'm super indecisive about what to order (because of all the options) and it does not go unnoticed. 

They have great smoothies, snacks, and wraps but what I always come here for is the butter coffee. They make it perfectly and if you're ever looking for something light but filling, get it as your breakfast. You'll feel full till lunch time and it gives so much energy. Plus, they make it so good here.  

Also try the peanut butter energy balls - my fav. 

Basically the place is great and if I could, I would come here every day."}
{"text":"Fuel + has been our breakfast spot during our time in Toronto. They have tons of Vegan/vegetarian options. Simple and delicious! The service is amazing and super helpful. They even have butter coffees, turmeric chai... Highly highly recommend it!! Get the power snack balls they are to die for!"}
{"text":"The hot oatmeal protein shake was perfect on this frosty morning!  Very filling and tasty!  Friendly staff.  Clean and bright with easy to read menus.  

I'll definitely return and try other items."}
{"text":"Fuel+ is still my favourite spot downtown. This location is lovely and normally not to busy. Food, service, price, atmosphere is all great."}
{"text":"Hands down my new favourite place to eat. This place hits it out of the ball park for me. The only sorta negative thing to say about fuel + is the street sign doesn't stand out so it can be a little hard to see. Frankly I wish I noticed this place years ago. I can't rave enough about it. The food & drinks are AMAZING fresh unique recipes. The prices are so good I am blown away. To my understanding the food is all or for the most part local. You can really tell with the quality of the products they put out that they have great sources. The service is on point too. Super helpful, warm & welcoming. I must say Fuel + is 110% worth checking out. It's worth taking a trip to come here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon..... I expected more. Reading the reviews on yelp I thought that this place would have it all but unfortunately it didn't. The young man who took my order was extremely unfriendly and looked/acted like he hated his job, this made me really want to cancel my order ask
for refund. I ordered the detox bowl and it was pretty mediocre. Honestly the smoothie bowls at Coras are better lol and with better service. I would love to give this place another chance if the staff is more friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Very good service. Clean and modern interior. Simple reasonably priced health food that tastes good and isn't bad for you. 

Their ads are also very professional with well executed photography. I hope this place becomes a chain. 

Spoke to the owner on my last visit and during the power outage around Christmas he apologized for the lack of products on the shelves but seriously everything was almost perfect!"}
{"text":"I have to revise this up to 5*.  They have expanded their food and beverage selection since first opening, and seem to keep improving.  The staff are friendly, and the place is always clean and a relaxing place to hang out. 

Two choices of brewed coffee are always available fresh and hot, one medium and one dark. Be warned - the dark \"Liquid Mettle\" is intense and recommended for caffeine junkies only!

They also have great smoothies, protein shakes, and a homemade ginger ale."}
{"text":"Love this cute little place ! The staff / owner are so enthusiastic and passionate about what they do and that energy just pass to all the customers come here and made everyone's day better .  The conversation flows and seems that they remember all their regulars customers which is pleasant . 

It has a good variety of selections and not like the healthy drink shop only offer protein shakes . They offer cold press drink , smoothies , fruit shake all look really delicious . It also has organic coffee and tea with their twist. I had their signature butter coffee which has americano , MTC oil ( a blend of coconut oil and almond oil ) and grass feed butter all blended together so yummy . The texture is creamy ,smooth without any greasy mouth feel and of course buttery.  Was surprisingly good I drank it up in a few minutes . 

They also has an app so that could get coupons and stamp cards. And  believe It or not they even have tutorial to teach you how to make some of those drinks . How sweet ! 
I would definitely come back and try more scrumptious treats."}
{"text":"Trust everyone who is raving about this place. I discovered it on a walk home from the gym about a year ago even though it looks pretty unassuming on Church St. I stopped in for a protein smoothie, which was delicious, and went back many times since for quinoa salads, smoothies, peanut butter balls (not too sweet!)... Cute, clean shop with the friendliest and most helpful owners. Prices are totally reasonable for the quality and service, and they even have an app you can use when you make purchases to save in the future! Next on my list is to try their butter coffee. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love the spicy ginger chai tea. The space is small, but very modern and clean. They have smoothies and a variety of healthy and gluten-free snacks.  They also sell Vega protein powder in the back.  Service is great here and the guys are super friendly.

This place is like your local organic food store, but the cafe version.  I also picked up a aspertame-free gum pack and a gluten-free brownie made with chick peas from here.  The brownie tasted good even though it had hidden healthy ingredients in it.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"Gary and Chester run this 2 year old Church Street favourite of mine that focuses on healthy affordable selections of food, smoothies and delicious hot caffeinated (and decaf) drinks.

Signatures include Butter Coffee with MTC oil and organic butter, one bite energy morsel Fuel Balls, Organic Pumpkin Smoothies, Grapefruit Tea and Organic Ginger Chai Latte and a lightly flavoured Gingerbread coffee.

Vega health products, select merchandise (perfect for any gift occasion) and loyalty cards available too.

Love that there is always an outlet for me to plug in my laptop.

My favourite place to satisfy my coffee fix!"}
{"text":"Just had the lemon kombucha and it was outstanding! I tried the peanut butter chocolate chip power ball and it was very satisfying and flavourful. We met Chester and his partner Grant, the owners, and they really made me and my girlfriend feel at home in our own neighborhood. I look forward to more visits. :)"}
{"text":"I come here for the bulletproof coffee and it is right on...however it is a bit pricy ..

I tried the smoothies once which were absolutely disappointing .. it felt artificial tho they claim its fresh!"}
{"text":"Great healthy breakfast/ lunch spot. They've got lots of smoothies and use Vega powder. Good coffee (I also tried their coconut butter coffee which was really tasty). They have some prepared salads/ sandwiches and snacks that looks great. I got a wrap that was really good for prepackaged. Kombucha and other healthy take aways too. They also have an app worth checking out (free coupons and deals! )"}
{"text":"I love the coconut water they have here. my favorite brand!! they have really amazing vegan and gluten free options. really nice relaxing atmosphere, and super sweet staff;)"}
{"text":"I thought this place was a pharmacy or something and I'm sure glad I was wrong! Really amazing butter coffee and protein balls. I'm looking forward to trying some of their other menu items too. Super friendly staff and great overall vibe. I'm happy to be able to make this place part of my daily routine!"}
{"text":"Fuel + is delicious and healthy (and insta worthy)! It's also quite expensive, but good things don't come cheap. 

I recommend the mango avocado smoothie bowl! Yum!"}
{"text":"Totally a fan. 

Why? 

1. They have the bestest server. As in most best! Bestest!
2. The protein shake is yummy. Did you try chocolate peanut butter? 
3. They are community-focused bringing added flavour to the community
4. They have TONS of organic items
5. They don't use aspartame as sugar substitue

Oh well. What else? Just come and enjoy."}
{"text":"I was invited to Fuel Plus's Fall/Winter tasting event on October 29th to try out their new menu items. This was my very first media invite so I was super excited. When I got there, I was flooded with samples. I definitely enjoyed their signature fuel balls, which were all made in house and only 100 calories each! In my opinion, the best item I got to try was their Grilled Breakfast Burrito! I kept asking if there were going to be more samples because I couldn't get enough of it! I thought it was pretty cool that their ginger ale were made in-house, so if you enter the cafe, you'd be hit with a strong ginger smell. The Spicy Ginger Chai was definitely delicious! I do recommend drinking it slowly and thoroughly enjoying it just because it can overwhelm the taste-buds.

My advice for anyone who hasn't had a protein shake before is to not order one head-on. I always like trying new things so I decided to order one of their shakes. I thought it would probably taste like milkshake. I was wrong. It was a lot to take in and if you are not a peanut butter lover, definitely do not order the Peanut Butter Chocolate Banana flavoured shake (I prefer their Pina Colada one instead). I couldn't finish up my shake because I was starting to get headaches, probably because I wasn't used to having so much protein at once (additional to all the other samples I had). However, if you use protein shakes to bulk up and tired of drinking the same kind you have at home over and over, give Fuel Plus a try! They have many flavours to choose from.

I spoke with both owners, Chester and Gary, who were extremely passionate about their cafe and what they were all about. Fuel Plus is about having healthy and organic options at a very affordable price. They felt that eating healthy shouldn't come with a high price. They wanted to give an opportunity for those who are thinking of eating healthier a chance without breaking the bank. They mentioned that their drinks are cheaper than Starbucks and for a generous quantity as well. Fuel Plus is also involved with a couple of running groups, such as Nike's Running Group every Tuesday and Get Out Canada. Runners in the area are also free to stop by and use their lockers for free as well! If people are interested in finding gifts for a vegan/gluten-free friend or a family member, Fuel Plus is currently offering gift baskets for this holiday!"}
{"text":"I had a delicious Acai Berry bowl and a mango-based fruit smoothie before my flight out of town. The service was great and the coconut in the bowl was a nice touch. The bowl was a smaller portion but filling. I spent about $21 CAD which is a bit steep. However, it tasted like I had really purchased a healthy and nourishing meal that started my day off right."}
{"text":"I was looking for a great coffee shop with friendly service and stellar coffee and this place delivered. My cappuccino was delicious and I'm a picky cappuccino drinker so that's saying a lot. Their protein Fuel balls are incredible too and at a dollar a piece a good deal. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Bright and cheery are both the renos and the staff.  I had their awesome organic \"23 degrees\" coffee which costs the same as a normal cup of brew (who says organic has to be expensive?)

But more importantly, do you like ginger ale?  Have you had home made ginger ale made from all natural ingredients and no nasty high fructose corn syrup?  The home made ginger ale they serve here is a must have item.  So unbelievably tasty and refreshing.  

Can't wait for the grand opening!

Great place to chill and shop for great products."}
{"text":"Had the kiwi kale smoothie and beet ginger juice, it was so good!  The Wheatgrass shots are organic and it tasted so sweet,  no chase needed.  Really friendly and helpful people working there.  Would come back again to try their butter coffee..  Yummy"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in Toronto to start my CHEAT DAY on a Saturday or Sunday morning! 

Cheat Day at Fuel+? But isn't everything super healthy and super nutritious? Fuck ya it is! AND it helps set the tone for the rest of my day with how and what I choose to eat afterwards.

Here's the low down:

The Protein Pack Cookie is hands down the BEST VEGAN GF COOKIE in Toronto, so much so, I order two. I eat one while I'm sitting down waiting for my smoothie bowl and the other later in the day. It's so frigging delicious. One time the manager told me the cookie was an older menu item that they just brought back after some time of it being off menu... that was the craziest shizz I heard at 9:30 AM. It's soooo good. I'm talking healthy, protein-packed, delicious, hard yet soft, sweet with NO REFINED SUGAR cookie from heaven. If you write a crappy review of this place, chances are YOU DIDN'T TRY THIS COOKIE. Get on my level, order this cookie, and update your review. 

The Smoothie Bowls are also super delicious and a must order. My go to's are:

The Breakfast Chocolate Bowl, Peanut Butter Protein Bowl, and The Vanilla Peanut Butter Protein Bowl. These three make me extremely happy, taste AMAZING, and made me a return customer. The consistency is perfect, never watery like soup; I'm talking thick, ain't going to drip off your spoon, serious smoothie bowl, AND the toppings are what probably make me order these all time. 

*Side Note* I have been let down two times with the inconsistencies of bowl toppings... I don't know if it was an employee error or if they ran out of specific toppings, but FUEL+, I look forward to those almonds and pumpkin seeds on my bowl!!! Don't do me wrong next time! 

I've also had Mango Avacado Bowl (very tropical tasting, and I'd consider ordering this more in the Summertime) and the Acai Berry Bowl (also okay... maybe if there were fresh strawberries cut on top, I'd order this again) which were good, just not my favourite standouts. The Breakfast Chocolate Bowl, Peanut Butter Protein Bowl, and The Vanilla Peanut Butter Protein Bowl are too good to pass up when you've been off sugar for six days.

The Kombucha is good but I found it a little sweet for my liking, the Real Lemonade was AMAZING and you can control the sweetness (!!!!), the Ginger Chai Latte was really good (personally, I love to drink this in Fall), and the Fuel Balls are also good and remind me of healthy vegan timbits.

I always find the staff here to be super friendly, wonderful to chat with, and happy to be at work, I love that there's free Wifi, AND they have the BEST people watching table right in front of the window looking out on Church St.

I love supporting this local business and you will too if you take my recommendations! 

OH, the Lemon Ginger shot is my #1 go to when I feel a cold coming on and I'm too lazy to juice lemon and ginger at home. I order a double (4oz) with cayenne pepper on top. It will burn but it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Great location and lovely open seating areas. Great breakfast spot with lots of menu items and delicious smoothie bowls. They have an incredible hot drink menu, as I had the most incredible spicy ginger chai latte with almond milk. The smoothie bowls are great and filling, however a bit expensive seeing as it is just a smoothie in a bowl."}
{"text":"In Toronto for a few days and saw this place was close to me on yelp and had great reviews so it was time to try it for breakfast. I love shakes for breakfast. 

There was only one lady when I walked in and line quickly formed behind me ! I got the blueberry banana vanilla chai protein shake and they also had a yelp coupon buy a drink get a free fuel ball which the lady gladly accepted so I went for a cinnamon one. 

Super friendly right off the bat and cute little store. 

Everything tasted great, and pretty average pricing for this stuff in the city. Looks like they had a lot of other good stuff I'll have to come back to try one day. I'll give them 5 stars, they're doing it right."}
{"text":"Finally crossed this off my hitlist, and I'm very happy that I did! 

I was greeted by a chipper Chester, and he spared me no details in telling me about the butter coffee (~$4.50) that I'd ordered. Grass-fed butter, blended with MCT, and locally grown coffee beans. Normally, I'm a one-sugar-splash-of-cream kinda girl for my coffee, but this coffee was so smooth and delicious on its own, I skipped all that and had it black.

He also encouraged me to check in, because (TADA!!!) there's a check-in offer of 1 Fuel Ball per drink order! I picked the seasonal one, which was peanut butter with expresso and rice! Yeah, that fuel ball barely made it out the door - I scarfed it down.

Overall - Love my experience there. The service was uber friendly and thoughtful. I can tell the owners are passionate about their products. My one gripe is that prices are not easy to see - website doesn't show it on the menu, and the signs in the store have the price in small, light coloured font. 

Oh, and now there's a FUEL+ app too!!! With punchcard for buy 8, get 1 free!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty meh... The service was unfriendly.  I ordered a large coffee, but she gave me a small.  The wraps that were pre made in the case were $10, and tiny.  Pretty expensive...  We ended up just ordering 3 energy balls that were good, but nothing special."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to drop by Fuel+ ever since. There is something beautiful about a cafe suggesting patrons to \"Be Happy. Stay Healthy.\" That is all most people ever want in life! 

The staff was kind. She explained each of the Fuel Balls and provided a brief about the store.

The Fuel Ball ($1.00 for 1, $2.50 for 3) was delicious. Made with sunbutter and all the other secret healthy concoctions, the organic peppermint fuel ball was delicious and slightly naughty with organic candy. It is definitely worth venturing out for a healthy delicious snack! 

Happy food, happy people!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop by to get breakfast and get a bit of work done! The peanut butter balls and coffee are amazing, ambience is good and the wifi is fast. I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great selection of healthy snacks with locally roasted beans.  Friendly and chic atmosphere.  Hopefully, the steamed milk quality improves.  It will hit the mark with more texturing to create a creamier quality for the lattes and cappuccinos."}
{"text":"Your search for an awesome, independently operated coffeehouse/smoothie bar ends here. I simply love this place. 

AMBIANCE - a great view of the Church street \"strip\" for people watching. It's especially nice during summer when the windows are open. Lots of warm reds and exposed brick. Very clean and cozy. 

DRINKS/SNACKS - I can honestly say everything I have tried here has been excellent. Smoothies, organic/vegan/allergen free baked goods, vegan wraps...and the list goes on! There is plenty of variety here so you are bound to find something you like. My personal favourite items are the \"fuel balls\" and the cucumber-Apple refresher. 

SERVICE - All staff are very attentive and friendly. You will find yourself becoming a regular quickly and getting to know everyone!

PRICING - Keep in mind you are supporting a local business by purchasing top-quality organic beverages and snacks. Naturally prices are a bit higher than your standard Tim Horton's but still quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Location: Church St, Toronto
Items Ordered: Medium fair trade, drip organic coffee ($2.14) + Gluten Free Brownie ($2.99) + Fuel Balls (1 for $1 or 3 for $2.50) 

I have been looking for a new coffee bar in my area and alas, one has opened up. Fuel+ is one of the new kids on the block, and they are the right kids for the block. I am here all the time, just for my daytime coffee fix. I also have frequent catch up sessions with girlfriends here. Why? Prices are right, the coffee is a wonderful departure from all the chains in TO, the venue is cute, bright and clean and they have a great selection of 'Sweets from the Earth' baked goodies which I love. In case you are unaware, Sweets from the Earth are eggless, dairy-free and often gluten free baked treats. 

I'm a fan of the fuel balls, a sweet little snack with a big boost of energy packed into a timbit size ball. I've had all 3 flavours and in order of preference I would have to say 1) Mango Coconut 2) Cinnamon Sugar 3) Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip. They are 90 calories, full of flavour and nutrition. Plus, you can taste the love put into them.
 
Just poking around the coffee bar, you can see they carry tons of clean, healthy food choices; organic soups and kettle corn, salads, gluten free pastas, vegan protein powders, tofu ice cream, baked goods and more. 

I've heard their homemade ginger ale is amazing. I have yet to try it, along with their large selection of shakes. 

Just to give you a sense of the owner's niceness, here's a little story. My girlfriend and I were due for a catch up date so we walked 2 blocks to Fuel+ in the pouring rain, which by the time we got there turned into a humid, rainless, scorching hot summer day. I assume the owners saw us melting in the sun, (our choice to sit in the sun of course) and whipped up a decent sample size of a refreshing virgin mojito, on the spot, and doled them out, free of charge, to the 4 people that sat in the coffee bar that day. The owners are lovely as is this splendid coffee bar in the village.  

Definitely, one my favourite coffee bars in the city."}
