{"text":"tasty traditional dishes?comfortable seat. Definitely a vietnamese restuarant that should not be missed."}
{"text":"Excellent Pad Thai! Very good spring rolls, and my wife enjoyed her stir fry very much! 

And the whole meal for 2 was less than 40 bucks! I was shocked! Lol

Highly recommend if you want some delicious Vietnamese cuisine :)"}
{"text":"It was after work and I needed a fix.  I usually go to Pho Hoai in Chinatown so my expectations are very high.  Ordered a bowl of sate soup and it came out promptly. Server was very friendly and even gave me a spring roll on the house.

The sate soup reminds me of a combination of Saigon Y2K and Saigon Red Sky.  It's a tad thick like Y2K and has a certain shrimp taste like Red Sky.  Not a bad combination but it didn't quite hit the spot.  As I said earlier, my expectations were high since Pho Hoai is one of the best satay soups in town.  

It's passable though.  If you can't make it to Pho Hoai in Chinatown, this is a good alternative.  Definitely better than most.  I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of this restaurant deceive you! I allowed that to be a reason for a while, but I finally got the chance to go in for service and I have to admit I was quite impressed with the ambiance. Everything was clean. The bottles on the tables were cleaned and topped up. Service was quick and efficient. The complimentary spring rolls were delicious! I ordered pho with chicken and was very happy with it. The rest of the party ordered meals and we all left satisfied. The price was just right. Yes, I'll be going back! Just keep in mind they close early!"}
{"text":"Very good food, quickly served, a real happy discovery on a Sunday where nothing else is open--this place is genuinely great.  Their spring rolls are tasty but a little skinny-- but their curried chicken looked great and the vermicelli dish I had was wonderful.  Really tasty.  

Cannot wait to go back--and did I say not too expensive?  Run, don't walk.  Not sure why I only gave it four stars-  doesn't look real upscale, maybe thats why.  But the service and food are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Nice little place and the food was great. We all had different soups and the spring rolls. It was all tasty and reasonably riced."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great service. I will return every time I'm in Calgary. I would give it 6 stars if I could!
I ate lunch and returned for dinner."}
{"text":"Good cheap viet-eats. Very kind service, and generous portions. You won't go away hungry, and the food goes down easy. Lots of seating. Not fancy, but clean."}
{"text":"Glad to see a real authentic Vietnamese restaurant DT. There's a lot of choices on the menu. We've been there a few times since it's open and had great food every single time. The environment is nice and clean. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Probably your best bet within a few block radius. There are definitely better places in Chinatown, but Mint Leaf is fast, affordable, and offers solid Vietnamese. Friendly service. They have take out and accept credit cards.

This location was previously The Ramen, and before that, Banzai."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the walk home from an entire Sunday in the office.... who wouldn't need a little comfort food?  Ordered the skewer wrap plate, which was a plate of beef, chicken and shrimp skewers, salad type vegetables, and little mats of vermicelli.  There were several side trays of that soft rice paper ... 

Two things... 1) Not enough meat.  I'd pay a extra few dollars for more skewers.  2)  Weird to put together!  So messy.

But you know what?  For all the mess it tasted good going down."}
{"text":"The great thing about Calgary is that there are so many great places to eat within walking distance downtown.  This places was literally a quarter of a block from my hotel, so I couldn't pass up trying it.

I tried the chicken wings and the pork vermicelli noodles, which came with 2 fried spring rolls, as well as a taro bubble tea.  I got it to go, and took it back to my room.  The wings were super fresh, and fried perfectly!  Great flavor, and moist.  The fried spring rolls were also fresh and delicious, and the vermicelli was awesome - lots of sprouts and veggies to mix in, and great fish sauce.  The only thing I'd improve on was that the pork did not have that nice sear that I love, but it still tasted good.  The taro bubble tea was thick and delicious, as well.

Will definitely be back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The price is right and the location is good, and I'm glad something decent has replaced Banzai.

I had no idea this place even existed until I was looking for a close easy lunch spot today, and Mint Leaf showed up. It was a good decision - I went for the house special pho, which while it didn't blow my mind, certainly hit the right spots as far as size, flavor, and ingredients. My friend got the house special fried rice, which from appearances was mediocre at best. 

The ambiance is just right,  classy but casual and a bit improved from the banzai décor. Water is served immediately and they are currently also giving out free spring rolls to all dine in customers, which is a decent touch. The price is a bit higher than most pho places, but considering it's central downtown location and the nearby competition I think that is completely warranted. 

This is so close to my office, so I can definitely see myself coming back regularly. Plus it looks like they have wings happy hour everyday from 3-7PM, 45c wings, so I'll be sure to check that out too."}
{"text":"Been here before, but just had lunch here again and it was great.  Contrary to what it says, they do take resos if you call (asked them when I was paying).  And if you plan on coming here for lunch on a weekday, you should get a reservation unless you come here early or late.  We got here 5 after noon and it was already packed, luckily there were two tables about to leave.

Ordered #67 which is great here.  It is banh hoi (vermicelli sheets with green onion oil) with lettuce, carrots, cucumber, basil.  For meats they provide the sugarcane shrimp, sausage and beef in betel leaf (the best).  They provide rice paper on the side and you essentially roll your own salad rolls with whatever you like.  For $16 it is a lot of food and extremely delicious.  I am not Vietnamese but it is comparable to ones home-cooked ones and ones I have had at Spring Vietnamese Cuisine.  

Ask for the bill at the counter and pay at the same time.  The server was nice enough to let us know that our food was arriving (meats were still being BBQ'd).  I would also recommend the Bun bowls here but can't comment on the Pho (friend said it was OK, perhaps a bit sweet)."}
{"text":"I was told Calgary Viet food is way better than Vancouver Viet food. So I had to put this to a test. My colleague and I came here for dinner. It was pretty empty coming here right after work at 5:30 pm. Sat down and I ordered the shredded pork with grill pork, spring roll vermicelli. I loved the spring rolls. It was nice and crispy. But the crispy is different from what you normally get elsewhere. Its like a fluffy, layered crispiness. Its kind of hard to explain. The fish sauce, I am assuming is made in house (just different from what I normally get). Not something you can get else where. 

Overall, the food was very delicious and is a WOW.

Décor is nice and clean. There are parking in front of the restaurant. Best part is that they take Apple pay. I forgot my wallet and was still able to pay with my phone. Thumbs up. 

Highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Ate dinner with my sons & husband. We arrived early on a Friday evening & it was empty. Quick, friendly service. Food arrived quickly. Delicious pho & chicken fried rice. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ventured to Mint Leaf (where Banzai used to be).  Customer service was quick and very polite.  The lady told us we would get a spring roll each on the house as part of their Grand Opening!  How nice!  Very good spring rolls and we each got our own dipping bowl.  The restaurant has only been opened for 1 month.  I have to mention that this must be one of the cleanest Asian restaurants I've ever been in.  Everything was spotless.

We ordered the following:
- 2. Shrimp Salad Rolls - made fresh, the rolls were still warm so I could tell it was just made.  Very good with the dipping sauce.
- 18. Satay Beef & Spring Roll w Vermicelli - Quite a big bowl of warm vermicelli topped with shredded carrots and cucumber, satay beef and sliced onions, peanuts and a nice bowl of fish sauce.  Needed more spice for my palate but tasty nonetheless.
- 26. Rare Beef & Tendon with Rice Noodle Soup - Very good clear beef broth, tender sliced tendon, comes with a plate of fresh bean sprouts, pieces of lime, and red Thai chilies.  We asked for the mint leaves but they ran out.
-28. Satay Beef with Rice Noodle Soup - Dad slurped up this satay soup and wolfed down his meal!  I liked the satay broth.  Quite rich.  Not coconut-based, though.  
33. Shrimp, Crab & Chicken Vegetable with Egg Noodle - I liked the broth, so clear and tasty!  Mum liked her dish!

We'd come back!"}
{"text":"The entrance to Mint Leaf looked dodgy but the interior is clean and spacious. I really enjoyed my satay beef soup noodle while my girl downed a big bowl of pho with rare beef. Great place for a quick lunch. My only complaint is that the condensed milk coffee at $5 is a bit steep."}
