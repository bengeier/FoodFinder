{"text":"No option for 0 stars given or that would have been my choice. Nasty, funky and old. Horrible customer service starting with front  desk through management. Needs complete renovation, including staff. Smells bad, noisy  noisy rooms, mold in showers, towels are gray, sheets have stains. I mean really - how disgusting is that?! Contacted management on 3 occasions going up the food chain every time to complain about the issues and was greeted by rudeness at every level. Unbelievable. If they weren't a Marriott property with point junkies, they'd be out of business.  GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!"}
{"text":"You will get the expected Marriott service, comfy, clean rooms and great comfy bed.  The shuttle service to and from airport AND epic is great.   The reason for the 3 stars is due to noise.  The hotel is set up with a huge central area with the hotel rooms around the edge   The noise fr folks in the bar amd elsewhere is very very loud.  I was glad I had earplugs."}
{"text":"It's loud, the employees are not friendly, and you simply can't trust them for a wake up call... I didn't even get an \"I'm Sorry\" when they entered a 6am wake up call for 7am!  And I've been Marriott Platinum for 10 years! If they can't be courteous to their elite guests, how are they to everyone else? Skip this hotel..."}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel because of a hosted conference at the venue and I won't be staying there again.  There were some scheduling complications and I was booked multiple rooms.  When I requested that the duplicate room to be canceled, the manager said that I would have to pay for the duplicate.   So I attempted to find someone to stay in the room and modified the reservation but then was charged for the cancellation still even though it was clear of their 48 hour policy.   Won't be staying here and glad the convention has moved to a new city!   Will be doing my part in encouraging the conference to stay away from this hotel.  Plus, the bed linens were dirty and the floor had stains!   No recommendation here!"}
{"text":"I stayed here for Epic training this past week. This is a nice place and has everything a hotel should have. I would have liked an in-room fridge, but another guy staying said you just have to request.  Pros: shuttle driver, John. John was fabulous with recommendations on things to do, making sure he never forgot anyone, and got us there on time every day. We had a nice drive to the airport and he pointed out any interesting points of interest. He is a very nice man, and will take good care of you.  Other pros: great free wifi, quiet rooms, nice rural setting Cons: distance from night life, if that's your thing. This hotel is not 'downtown' although shuttle will take you within a 3 mile radius. Room service menu was very small. I only ordered from it once. The food I got was fine but I would have liked having more choices."}
{"text":"Terrible value. This place should be like $70 a night.  No free breakfast, expensive wireless, pillows were either laughably huge or flat as a pancake, bad smells, no ventilation in bathroom, filthy carpet, cuddled creamer for the coffee. These are just some of the complaints that our entire group had, across over a dozen rooms."}
{"text":"Overall experience was good. Not fantastic, just good. We were a large group, and had some special requests that were handled (somewhat) well. Many hiccups later, we had a successful stay. This hotel is pet friendly, which was GREAT! The facility was clean and overall very accommodating. I was very impressed on the staffs professionalism and calm attitude when I brought some problems to their attention. They ultimately won my good review by extending our check-out (letting our dogs shack up), while we attended the sporting event we came to enjoy."}
{"text":"Was here for a gala at the adjoining conference center.  Service was terrible. The waitress kept slamming food and drinks on the  table. She only brought dinner for half the table and the rest had to wait for 15 minutes. One of the guests had to wait about 20 minutes for the meal. Horrible! I've been to many Marriotts before and hold a frequent visitor card, but this one has been the worst experience so far.  I know this isn't a review that completely reflects the hotel or any restaurants inside it, but the fact that this service was under the Marriott name prompted this review and rating"}
{"text":"I have stayed at this hotel for a weekend event in July for the past 4 years.  Although the decor isn't the most current, the beds and bedding are very comfortable, and with the blackout curtains, I sleep better and later than I often do at home.  The soundproofing between the rooms is quite good, but you do tend to hear everything happening in the restaurant/bar area.  The staff are extremely friendly, welcoming and helpful.  For the conference rate of $105, this hotel is a real value."}
{"text":"Service was great, including providing a local 3-mile and 5-mile running maps  Breakfast was excellent. We will be back."}
{"text":"Don't stay here if a good night's sleep is your goal. The way this hotel is designed, all the noise from the bar downstairs will travel directly up to your room. Even complaining to management doesn't do any good. My coworkers and I were here during the week, and every single night there was bar noise that prevented us from sleeping. I was several floors up and could pretty much hear every single conversation.   I agree with the other reviews, too, that this hotel is extremely outdated. It smells like chlorine from the waterfall in the lobby, and is really not a nice place to stay.  Recommend you stay at any one of the other hotels in Middleton."}
{"text":"I've stayed at this property a number of times and my most recent visit a couple of weeks ago will probably be my last.  I visited during a very slow time and was astonished at how dirty and gross it was.  There was a long list of issues that included, stained sheets and bed skirts, mystery dried substances on the walls and a pillow that smelled absolutely rank.  On top of this the air conditioning went out at night during a time when the temps outside topped 100.  My thermostat in the room registered at 81 degrees."}
{"text":"I stayed here for 10+ nights and must say that I would not recommend staying here.  The site says that there is a hotel shuttle but it does not communicate the operational hours for the shuttle.  Upon contacting the hotel to verify that there would be a shuttle I was instructed to contact the hotel upon arrival and they would send one out.  Upon calling the hotel, I was told that the shuttle does not operate until 2:30pm and have to take a cab at my cost.  Upon asking to speak with a manager the clerk put me on hold and told me to take a cab and the hotel will cover the cab cost.  During the first few days I had gotten I'll and bed ridden for a few days because of the carpet spray the hotel sprays on the carpet.  Upon seeing that I asked the housekeeper to not spray that because I am highly allergic to that and to let the rest of the house keepers know.  2 days later they sprayed that again.  It was such a struggle because most of the house keepers barely speak any English to the point that when they would come to my room and asked to come back at 2pm to clean the room, I would have to call the front desk asking them to also make clear what time to come back to my room.  More than one occasion they came before the agreed upon time.  What was worse on that very same day I called the front desk housekeeping entered my room before the agreed upon time while my husband was sleeping in the room.    I had also called the front desk letting them know I asked housekeeping to refrain from spraying the carpet because it made me ill, yet they continued to spray the carpet and the hotel did not offer switching my room.  Another struggle was room service.  I asked for a delivery time and it came 30 mins early.  In most cases that would be a good thing, however, I was I'll and bed ridden.  When I asked room service to come back but to keep my order warm he insisted that it will stay warm because the plate was hot.  I just gave up.  The insult to injury is that when signing the ticket, I entered the correct tip amount, and erroneously totaled the amount as i was I'll and could barely get out of bed.  It was only $1 but upon explaining to accounting and requesting a correction, I got no response to my request.  I hate to squabble over $1 but I find it unethical (most establishments check the total and enters what was meant to be given) that even for $1 the hotel would not respond.  The coin operated laundry was another in consistent experience.  The dispenser in the laundry room was broken.  The cost for the detergent was $.75.  I called the front desk and the manager who was so kind brought it to the laundry room and didn't charge me for 2 boxes.  Later the next day I went to the front desk and purchased 2 more boxes.  The girl behind the desk told me it was $1.00 per box.  I should make clear that I didn't have any problem paying, however, when asked to clarify the cost I was told the cost is $1.00 per box.  I explained that the dispenser in the laundry room is $.75 and why is it $1.00 at the front desk.  The girl told me if I buy it at the front desk it's $1.00 but if I buy it in the laundry room it's $.75.  I told her that the dispenser in the laundry room is broken and she told me at the front desk it's $1.00 and no viable reason why.  Despite that they had a few great staff persons (patrick and travis and shuttle drivers) it didn't make up for the bad experiences."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I Pricelined a room for our anniversary trip this weekend. We were super excited to get a \"3.5star plus\" hotel for a really good deal. It's too bad there were so many things that worked against making this a truly awesome hotel:   - The fact that there is no carpet between the pool and the elevators, so the floor is often dangerously wet.  - The fact that the bathroom door opened onto the toilet - you had to sidestep it in order to close the door.  - The fact that the night desk clerk, when counting the register, set the cash tray on the counter nearest the customers. It would have been an easy, quick jaunt out the front door with it. - The 20min it took to get extra towels - The empty ice bin in the vending area - The desk clerk who came out to talk to customers while still chewing food  By far the worst offense was the fact that check-out time was noon, yet housekeeping tried to enter our room at EIGHT IN THE MORNING. I can't imagine it's that hard to find out which rooms are ready for cleaning, and which are not.   The only real pro was the bedding, which was luxe and fluffy. Not even close to being worth the $2800 they sell it for, but fun for a night.   The room ended up being cheap for the name-brand, but more satisfaction could have been found from a lesser-name place. Lesson learned for next time."}
{"text":"If I could give this hotel zero stars, I would. The staff was extremely unhelpful when I checked in and informed me that I had double booked my room. When I checked out, no one asked me how my stay was. It was very noisy when I was going to sleep because there was a convention in town. I ordered a flatbread from the hotel bar (which was actually great), but it took more than 40 minutes and there were less than 5 people in the entire bar. My experience with management made me never want to stay at another Marriott Hotel again. I could care less if the furniture and decor is a little outdated, but the staff completely ruined my experience."}
{"text":"Doors automatically slam loudly behind you. Just imagine it's 2 am and you're peacefully sleeping and your hotel neighbors are coming back into their rooms. SLAM! After SLAM! No way to stay asleep thru it. It's 2:30 am and I'm writing this review because I'm wide awake from being awoken by slamming doors."}
{"text":"I'm baffled by the poor reviews. I thought this hotel was great! The front desk clerk was very thorough & helpful. The room was very large & spacious...much larger than most others I've been to, and very clean, as well. Overall, I thought it was a very nice hotel!"}
{"text":"The rooms themselves were nice, with good, clean bedding and lots of space.   There were four people staying in our room (a double), but only three towels in the bathroom, which was... pretty awkward.    The staff were quite pleasant and friendly but obviously over-worked.  They worked really hard to make our event extra special, though.  There appears to only be one set of elevators in the whole hotel, and they take forever.  At check out, we waited for over 20 minutes for an elevator (the two that actually stopped at our floor were full) and eventually we just gave up and carted our luggage down six flights of stairs.  There were several people going up and down the stairs (guess they gave up too) which made for some interesting negotiations.  The pool, however, was just... wow.  There are no showers or locker rooms, just a bathroom.  The light covers were filled with bugs, especially over the hot tub.  The sides of the pool are covered in scum... it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in ages.  The jets in the hot tub barely functioned.  I've seen much nicer facilities at WAY cheaper hotels.  Lastly, we were all but turned away at the restaurant in the lobby, despite the empty tables.  The staff worked us in and (between apologies) explained to us that it wasn't actually a restaurant, but just a bar area that serves Room Service food."}
{"text":"First night not so great. Immediately apparently means 30 minutes later AFTER you call again to the front desk. No one in the room next to me, alarm clock goes off. After waiting 10 minutes, and then knocking on door with no response, call front desk and am told it will be taken care of immediately. Waited 30 minutes, and called back. Then someone came up to take of it. It been a bad day, and this is an excellent end to it. 3 more nights to go, woo hop! Ambiance C Cleanliness C (generally grungy everywhere) Customer Service D (Only selected 1 star because I couldn't post with none)"}
{"text":"Had an okay stay here at this Marriott (which looks to have been an Embassy Suites at one time, judging by the interior).  I was traveling on business, and appreciated the quiet rooms and very comfy bed.    Some of the interior could use some updates, especially in the bathroom.  One major annoyance was that the blackout drapes were for decoration only and couldn't be closed all the way to make the room dark.  What a pain!!  Other than that, friendly staff and mediocre breakfast in the morning.  There really isn't anything around of note (all chain restaurants and office buildings), so I think on my next trip I'll drive a little extra to stay in Madison and bypass Middleton!"}
{"text":"It's hard to believe this is a Marriott property.  I've logged over 50 nights at this hotel so I think I'm decently qualified to offer a balanced review.  This last stay will be my last overall.  Although the staff is generally friendly & professional, their competence is questionable.  I could offer a list of offenses but it would take too long & most aren't major, just a little annoying. Concierge lounge is fine, no complaints.  Overall, the hotel gives the impression that it is too large for its operating budget and the competence of the staff.  It greatly lacks attention to detail.  I frequently have to call for things that have been left out of the room (missing hairdryer, washcloths, double body wash but no shampoo...and so on).   The linens are old and tired (holes in the sheets & duvet covers, limp towels, some with stains).  I am a platinum member of Marriott and am always booked into a King room.  This time, they put me in a room with 2 doubles for no reason.  I immediately changed rooms and the TV did not work.  I then plugged my laptop into the lamp and it made a loud \"pop\" and blue sparks came out.  All of the power in the room was then knocked out.  This is unacceptable, as the wiring in that lamp was obviously faulty & dangerous.  I was lucky my computer was not fried.  The last straw came when I killed a large fly in the room with the first thing I could grab, which was the paper breakfast menu.  I then crumpled the menu and threw it away.  The next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow.  I know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where I crumpled it up.  Outrageous.  Anyone who would think this is acceptable service is out of their mind.  I will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers.  During a single stay, I have never heard so many staff say, \"I apologize for that\".  Sorry isn't enough, I'll be trying the Hilton Garden Inn next time.  Good service speaks for itself and does not require apologies."}
{"text":"I'd have to agree with the prior posts...why all of the hate on this hotel? I travel constantly for work and always stay at Marriott properties when available and I'd have to say this Marriott is one of the nicest ones I've stayed at. First, I am a Platinum Elite member and there are many times at other Marriott properties I have to ask to be put on the concierge floor when this should be an automatic; didn't have to ask at the Madison Marriott West. The concierge lounge was spacious with ample seating, the front desk staff was welcoming, and parking was a breeze.  After my stay I received an email from the manager, even though it was an auto-generated email, it was a personally written email and provided his direct line if I had any concerns/questions.   As far as the noise issues, I didn't hear a thing and slept perfectly in a large king room."}
{"text":"This is a nice looking but poorly designed hotel. Despite having over 300 rooms, they only have 2 elevators. I was here for a convention with a friend who recently had foot surgery and needed a wheelchair. Lets just say other hotel guests were not gracious about giving us priority on the elevators even though we were on the second floor and even the largest of humans should be able to manage 1 flight of stairs with 2 good feet. Checkout was a nightmare because of this elevator situation. Fortunately a staff member was kind enough to allow us access to the service elevator after he saw how rude the guests were about this.  The food is also terrible and overpriced. Several people at the convention developed food poisoning after consuming the calamari. That was no fun for anybody. I highly recommend the Sprecher Brewery restaurant across the street - comprable prices but larger portions and significantly better food!   The temperate throughout the facility is horrible as well. Our room was cold no matter how high we adjusted the thermstat and the convention space was hot enough that I nearly fainted on at least 2 occasions. The only reason this hotel gets 2 stars is because it was clean and the beds were extremely comfortable with their down-filled duvets and fluffy pillows."}
{"text":"Although most of the workers were very pleasant, the customer service by one female during check-in as well as another at the breakfast buffet was so unprofessional that I will not be a patron at this location again. After complaining of the rude service, for which we were given the excuse of a busy weekend, we asked to be connected with management, who never followed up. Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"This is the first Marriott I have ever been a little disappointed in.  I thought initially it was going to be an amazing hotel, since I totally screwed up on the reservation (made it for the wrong day) and the girl at the desk was so cool to work with me and get me a room when the whole place was fully booked.    Except, the place was fully booked for the \"Little Miss Junior Miss\" Pageant, or some other stupid name like that, which meant HELL for Andy and I as the entire place was infested with pre-teen beauty queens, their scary domineering mothers, and other random siblings that came along for the ride.  Can you say O. M. G.    Now, normally this would be a non-issue, as we are rarely in our hotel room except to sleep and once in the room you couldnt hear a lot of hallway noise.  But this 10 story hotel had a grand total of 2 elevators, which were packed at all hours of the day with girls in gowns and tiaras, groups of girls in heavy makeup, or wet children dripping from the hotel pool. This made getting in and out a bit challenging since we were on the top floor.   I realize this is hardly Marriotts fault that the Junior Misses had descended upon Middleton, since they are just trying to turn a buck in this economy, but the design of this place was not user friendly in the slightest.  Also, hey brilliant idea guys, put the pool across the hall from the elevator and then make that whole area tile so people track water out and the floor is slippery!  Nice.  And also understaff the dining area so noone can get in and eat because there is noone to clean off the tables and take your order.  Nice planning!  Man, that whole experience left a bad taste.  The worst part will be trying to convince Andy to stay at a Marriott ever again as he is just now getting relief from the migrane he got on Saturday."}
{"text":"***This Marriott definitely feels dated and it is not in Downtown Madison; it is a comfortable enough hotel, service is good and room rates are reasonable; however, the hotel has kind of a depressing look and feel to it; it needs an update***  This Marriott kind of feels like an airport hotel.  Airport hotels tend to be very outdated and there is typically little incentive to do a renovation because the hotel has a steady stream of customers due to its proximity to the airport and convenience of airport shuttle transportation.  This Marriott has a similar look as the Philadelphia Airport Renaissance.  Both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up 9 to 12 levels high.  You do get a nice look onto the open atrium as you ascend on the quick glass elevators at this property.  Unfortunately, this hotel is very out-of-date.  The lobby and cafe looks like something from the early to mid-80s.  The rooms are a little more contemporary though parts very dated; at the kitchenette sink, there was a bottom cabinet that may have been a dishwasher at one time; instead, it was empty with lots of dust and exposed piping (not nice to find at any hotel).  The breakfast buffet did not inspire freshness either.  The food quality was not horrible, but a lot of the food was quite salty.  Food options included bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, continental breakfast options, and an omelet bar.  In addition, the poor lighting in the lobby and throughout the hotel made the food and other stuff maybe feel worse than they actually were.  This Marriott is still a comfortable place to stay and has good customer service.  The rooms are comfortable with good beds and linen.  The room temperature was fine though the unit did not seem to consistently keep the room cool.  The shower was fine.  This Marriott has many suites so you have a good shot of getting upgraded if you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member.  The suites are spacious and the bedroom is separated from the living room area with a door.  Their suites are outfitted with a mini fridge, kitchen sink (as mentioned) and a microwave.  On weekends, Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members get an offer of full breakfast buffet for two per Saturday and Sunday or 750 Marriott Rewards points per Saturday and Sunday.  This is a new nationwide Marriott benefit for Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members and the hotel is only obligated to offer a continental breakfast.  I have been to a few properties (Santa Clara Marriott, Minneapolis Marriott City Center) that are only doing the bare minimum--continental breakfast--so this Marriott is definitely going above and beyond in this area (though the quality of the full breakfast buffet, as already mentioned, was not that great).  The front desk was nice and helpful.  Room rates are good, but this hotel is not in Downtown Madison.  It is only a 7 to 10 minute drive to Madison though.  However, I am not sure if getting to Downtown Madison on a Wisconsin football game day is challenging.  This Marriott would not be a good property for a long stay.  This hotel just does not feel fresh enough.  It is a comfortable enough spot for a short stay though due to their comfortable rooms and good service.  If you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member, they do treat you well here and maybe even better than some Marriott properties.  This Marriott has its own free parking lot.  It is easy finding an open space."}
{"text":"Cold showers two morning's  in a row.  Front  desk claims  because  they were full.  No excuse for 142.00/night Buffet  wad good though.  Sound travels in atrium area.  Don't expect  quite  night sleep"}
{"text":"If you've ever wondered what it would be like to attempt to sleep on the infield of the Indy 500, while the race is in progress, and you don't care to spend the money on race tickets, just book a room at this hotel. The property is immediately, I mean immediately adjacent to the infamous \"Beltline\" highway, and the sound attenuating properties of the windows are non-existent.  I thought the heavy curtains that frame the sheer might help to reduce the mind numbing highway noise.  But guess what, they're decorative only and can't be closed. I spent $65/night through Price Line, and that was about $50 too much. A few annoyances, in addition to the brain gelatinizing cacophony:  1) What the hell is with the 30 lbs. down duvets that these hotels seem to think add a half star to their rating?  They're excessively hot on all but the coldest nights, they weigh a freaking ton, and when they end up on the floor (as is always my deal) you have nothing left but the thread bare, pallid, dirty sheet. Which isn't enough.  2) Setting the alarm clock requires an advanced degree in electrical engineering.  Seriously, you really expect people to use these pieces of junk? Which leads me to annoyance number 3:  3) When I tried to use the dirty, circa 1981 phone to set my wake up call, and I successively pressed all four of the \"At your service\" buttons I got nothing.  I messed around with the phone for 15 minutes before I finally reached a guy working in the bar (I could never hope to duplicate this feat).  He was kind enough to transfer me to the front desk.  4) I was going to use the in-room coffee maker but it had been filled, at some point, with sour smelling water.  On my worst day of caffiene deprivation, I wouldn't have used that disgusting and antiquated little machine.  A flat screen TV and a weighty down (or down substitute, as it where) duvet do not make a 3.5 star hotel! This place needs a major capital infusion.  Thank you for your time."}
{"text":"This is the second time I stayed here with my b/f.  This time I was less impressed.  The staff as usual was fantastic.  They always are as helpful and as kind as ever.  Great job to you guys!  This is a business hotel so it's generally empty on the weekends, which is nice.  We had a king room on the 10th (top) floor.  Room was large enough.  Clean.  But, the heater was LOUD.  Squeaky.  So we messed with it... nada.  So we changed rooms, not a big deal.  We went right next door.  That room was the same as the last.  Downsides to this room though, the phone was dirty... I knew this cause the phone was tan/beige colored.  It was yucky.  Also, the tub liner in the first room was filthy.  Another thing I wish this hotel would change is installing fans in the bathrooms!  My boyfriend also pointed out that the sheets on the bed were super starched.   If you moved it sounded like sandpaper on sandpaper.  Madness.  I did have a odd triangle shaped hole in the sheets on my side of the bed...so that was less than plesant too.  Oh ,also the hot tub was down for maintence when we were there :( Bummer.  But the pool was open and no one was in it.  They also have a stellar gym.    To recap:  PROS: Great Staff Great location Large Rooms Nice TV Great Gym Has a pool/hot tub  CONS: Outdated Bathroom Outdated/Dirty Phones Over Startched Bed Linens (both rooms had the same issues)"}
{"text":"We have exhibited at a conference at this hotel every year.  It is so nice to see familiar faces behind the checkin area. Patrick Cady & John Polnow made our check-in smooth & easy (unlike the last two hotels where we stayed). The beds are very comfortable. The atrium off of the lobby is beautiful and an excellent space for vendors.  The tables in the exhibit area had been set up exactly as we had requested.  I was so impressed with the management. Kurt Peterson made  himself available to us throughout our stay. Sometimes it seemed like he was here 24/7. Staff really seemed to respect him. Another manager that we really like is Keola Shimooka.He remembered us from previous years.  Today I learned that Lamont & Mark, the gents who set out the food for breakfast & breaks have been at this hotel close to 20 years. They are always smiling. I generally provide less detail but we had such a poor experience last week in Baltimore with staff - from check-in through checkout."}
{"text":"This is the worst hotel in the area in my opinion if you actually want to sleep.  The noise level is horrible due to the setup of the bar and the rooms.  I called the front desk to complain.....the response was laughter.  Definitely my last time here."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Madison Marriott West to teach a workshop in the conference center.  The hotel is a very nice facility, one that has been around for a while but it has been well maintained and in particular the room I had was fresh, up to date and comfortable, definitely up to Marriott standards.  What set the hotel apart was the staff.  Their attention to detail and their focus on service was amazing .  They anticipated what I would need in my room as well as what I I would need in the conference center as if they has ESP!"}
{"text":"Nice hotel, got a nice upgrade! Great lobby bar and great front desk service. Hotel is about 20-30 minutes from UW"}
{"text":"My recent (three) stays here have been satisfactory, not horrible, but on the other hand nothing spectacular. You'll have the basics covered: a roof over your head, clean room, and food at the concierge lounge (Susan is fantastic!). Underwhelming and inconsistent front desk staff (esp in the evening). Asked multiple times to have the WSJ delivered to my room in the morning during each stay, but done only during the first stay. Third stay front desk staff didn't realize I was a Marriott member; I had to supply my own number. I had to ask to be put on concierge floor. This has only happened to me at this Marriott establishment.    My colleague had to wait for an hour and half for the shuttle to pick her up at MSN airport. Another colleague had to walk down to the front desk to get some soap for there was no soap in her room upon arrival.  Observations: elevators at times smelled like mold, waterfall in main lobby smells of mold as well. Outdated carpet and furniture - hasn't changed since stays in 2007 yet there is a brochure promoting Shop Marriott in the room. Bathrooms have no fans, popcorn ceilings. Even the shuttle drivers' uniform is outdated. Website description states:  luxurious bedding. Clean yes, soft maybe, luxurious no. AC in room is loud, bring earplugs. Restaurant more often than not empty. Fitness center - cardio equipment and dumbbells, but no yoga mats/foam rollers.    Ten min walk from Greenway Station Shopping Center with access to restaurants and shops. Convenient if you don't have a rental car."}
{"text":"Stayed at this Marriott while I was attending some training sessions at Epic.   The hotel has everything a modern hotel would have. The rooms and decor a bit dated, but that maybe because it's Wisconsin???  The rooms are good sized. The King single, had a king bed, a 32\" LCD TV, ipod charging alarm clock, but a really small bathroom. I did have troubles with the heating during my stay here. It took the engineers two days just to get some heat into the room, and they continuously had to check on it while I was out during the day.   There is a breakfast buffet in the morning (not complimentary) and this is where you can have lunch/dinner or enjoy a drink at the bar. The bar had a good selection of local Wisconsin beers as well as your typical domestics. Bar tenders were super friendly and made the stay a little more enjoyable.  If you're a Marriott Reward member, be sure to have them add your access to the concierge lounge. Here they have free continental breakfast, snacks during the day, and a light meal at night. They have some type of honor system bar too in the evening. Also in the concierge lounge, you can use their computers for Internet browsing."}
{"text":"I don't think I've been to a dirtier Marriott. I've been here for three days so far, and i don't think the cafe in the lobby has been vacuumed once, as I've monitored the pile of crumbs underneath the tables and am finding more crumbs (and wrappers and chicken wing bones) each night. My room was dirty (including large stains on the bedskirt and chair) upon arrival, and since I was here for a week for business, I decided not to look around my room too much to save myself from being completely grossed out. Some of the shuttle drivers think they're Indy 500 drivers, swerving around corners so fast that everyone grips the sides of the vehicle. Our driver also asked two people to share one seat in the van, never mind the rules about seatbelts.  Also, if you come in the evening hours and want to eat at the bar, expect to wait no less than 1 hour for your food."}
{"text":"It is a quiet hotel.  I did not have a need for anything from the staff.   I was not charged for parking, like others have complained about. I was upgraded to the 10th floor which made access to the lounge easy.    I wish that Marriott did not have a arrangement with Pepsi.  I so much prefer a Coke.   What did I learn today?  The \"call of the void\" from the 10th floor."}
{"text":"Looking forward to the odd dreams I'll be having tonight having to listen to the echo chamber of marauding drunkards and odd Sally Gigglepuss downstairs whooping it up laughing and just being annoying at near midnight. CORPORATE AMERICA SHUT UP!!! If you want a quiet's night sleep and you're a Marriott person I'd recommend the newer Fairfield down the street."}
{"text":"Worst hotel in the US hands down. The room was dirty: coffemaker, sheet stained, pillow stained, mattress was lopsided, glasses had grime inside stuck, carpet was pulled back and fraying. When complaining to the front desk they could care less. The manager Ben talked to my husband and I with complete disrespect about all of our concerns. No apology called me a liar and when I got upset at the way we were being treated he told me to leave!! (How does this guy have a job in hospitality?) That's the kind of hospitality you will get here. Not to mention the over priced undercooked cold chicken. Stay in your car before staying here, its probably cleaner. Contacted corporate so I will update on how that goes next."}
{"text":"Edited to update: After we got home we got both a parking and internet charge. Parking is NOT FREE and apparently, you can log into premium internet, though they advertise free. This was either very poorly explained or completely left out of the information we received at check-in."}
{"text":"We booked a hotel room for a hockey tourney that was cancelled. when we cancelled our room it was like thanks for the cancellation, no word of charges..Then go figure they posted to our card like lightening and accounting refuses to do anything! Horrible customer service!!!"}
{"text":"What an abject failure - customer sevice non existnant  Ammeneties plebian at best. Coupled with the tone set by management insesitive to customers? Please go away or change as soon as possible - oh yah! New Mariott downtwon Madi very soon. Bye Middleton! Silly borks. See Ya!"}
{"text":"What a mess of a hotel. I guess that maybe I grew up in an era where the Marriott name meant class and luxury.  I can't blame Marriott for the fact that the hotel was hosting the Little Miss (Jon Benet) America contest. The hotel was overran with 6 year olds wearing make up and donning skimpy outfits. It's disturbing that Parent's lives are so unfulfilled that they have to dress their children like Cocktail waitresses at a seedy bar.  The hotel was totally booked. You had ten floors worth of rooms, but yet the hotel only had two elevators. It was pretty annoying to wait 15 minutes every time you wanted to go up to your room.  And the kicker was on Sunday morning when we wanted to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The hotel had nobody on duty to bus tables, so while it was obvious that the restaurant was half empty, but there was a 15 minute wait to be seated. Of course the hostess acted like an office temp, with a bad attitude. That was a perfect ending to our hell stay at the Marriott-Madison West. I couldn't check out of that hotel fast enough.  In the future, I would rather stay at a hotel with sticky sheets, that rents it's rooms by the hour than ever stay at a Marriott again."}
{"text":"I chose to stay at a cheaper Fairfield Inn for this Madison trip but someone I was traveling with who outranked me wanted to stay here. She said it was 10 miles closer to our next destination though it was $40 more. I don't know..I tend to try to save money. However, since she chose this place and we would be staying at a nicer hotel, I was in!  Being a full service Marriott, it's pretty nice. It's still a bit old fashioned and the rooms are all surrounding this hollow center and the atrium houses the restaurant. Such a waste of space I thought and it's a perfect place for a jumper to make brain splashing everywhere. I wonder if it ever happened? Every time I looked down from the 10th floor, I had that imagination in my head of jumping.  Anyway...they gave me an upgrade this time. I had an expanded junior suite with living area. That was nice. The room was really spacious. The concierge lounge wasn't bad at all. We had breakfast there and they used real eggs for the scrambled eggs. It was so creamy and not like those dried hard scrambled eggs made from dehydrated egg powder.  One thing I really don't care with all the full service Marriott is their toiletries. They used to have Bath and Body Works but now they switched to a brand called Than. Not sure wtf is Than but it smells too oaky woody masculine for me. Ugh. Change it.   Other than that, It was a good stay and I have stayed here many times before. If the price is right, I'd be over again soon!!"}
{"text":"I can't stand to sit here and read these horrible reviews.  When my son was receiving treatments for spine/ brain cancer, at UW Hospital, we did not  have many choices at that time of where to stay during and between treatments. My son would become so ill from all the radiation plus chemo, and the radiation treatments were at two 6 hour intervals every day, So we couldn't venture far most days. Altho we had spent time at the Ronald McDoanld house, after a time I needed to make my son feel less a patient and more like a celebrity for a day. So I decided to take a paycheck, and chose a day between visits to get a suite at the Marriott West.  Altho my son had to use a mobile IV unit, and was scarred on his  head from radiation burns, this Marriott was most accomodating and incredible. We had a gorgeous suite, exquistie room service and gracious attentions. These attentions were NOT triggered by my sons illness, but sincerely born from true proffesionalism and great training.  This is a beautiful establishment, and I personally cannot stand the voices of spoiled whiners on these previous reviews.  This Marriott will hold dear to me always and is worthy of your travel time relaxing time, and most of all your needs no matter to what extent. Stop being so ridiculously spoiled and realize.  This Marriott is above average."}
{"text":"I got my room off priceline for 75, so i was happy with the price. I would not pay the 150 the hotel was asking for. The room was clean and pretty big. The toliet wouldnt flush, but after stopping by the front desk it was taken care of. No free breakfast, so we didnt eat at the hotel. We didn't use the pool, so nothing to say about that. I do agree with the other reviews that the design of the building is not good. There was a wedding going on the one night and it was pretty loud late into the evening. Good location, right off the highway. We were into madison in 10 miuntes."}
{"text":"Great rooms, great rates. I've stayed in Middleton before but this location can't be beat. They have a shuttle that will even take u to the convenience store. Spacious, clean, an very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Bedding was stained on pillow and comforter.  Asked front desk to have this changed upon leaving for dinner.  After arriving back at the hotel, bedding had not been changed.  Called front desk and was told that housekeeping was gone for the night.  At check-out I mentioned the issue and was simply verbally told \"Sorry.\"  Not acceptable.  My 2nd Mariott stay this year, and I am not giving up my Priority Club Platinum membership to ever try Mariotts again."}
{"text":"This Marriott though....  I don't want to give them two stars, but I have to. I checked in on Monday and checked out on Friday, so I feel like I was there long enough to give a solid review.  When I first arrived I asked for a CC authorization form for my company and they gave it to me. I had my operations person fill it out and fax it, to the number on the sheet. On Thursday, when I followed up to ensure my check-out was lined up, I find out that they don't have the form and that the form wasn't the correct phone number. How was I supposed to know this?   This needs corrected.  On Tuesday, I called the front desk to ask about the rate because my rate was $30 lower than my colleagues rate, but we had the same length of stay. The woman that answered the phone was very rude and essentially continued to tell me she couldn't do anything for me or my colleague.   Not helpful.  As far as the room goes, the King room was large and had enough room for a sofa, a desk, and some lamps without feeling crowded, but the ironing board was stained. The iron needed replaced. The toiletries smell very masculine. The TV is really blurry and fuzzy. Towels were extra fluffy and I really liked them a lot.  Not the best, but not the worst. The bed was comfortable.  The elevators were slow (and there were only two of them).   The workout room was decent (3 treadmills, free weights, and a stair stepper).  The front desk said they would send something to my room due to my inconveniences, and never did (i stayed up waiting for this to arrive).  In addition to the rude woman on Tuesday night, the lack of follow-through was also very annoying. Please don't say you will send something to your guest's room and not follow-through, though I can't say I am that surprised this happened and finally went to bed.  The concierge lounge was pretty decent and Susan, the concierge in there at night, is so friendly. She is the redeeming quality at this Marriott.  For the price, this is just not worth it."}
{"text":"Had to stay here again and I was REALLY unhappy.  The main issue stemmed from my door lock. My card continually stopped working. After three times, I was promised a tech would go see to it ASAP. I returned to my room thirty minutes later and found that my car was not working. This worried me as a tech was supposed to take care of it.   I returned to the front desk to learn no one went to see it. I had my card reset again.  I was then met at my door by a technician. He said the spring was bad in the door. I don't really know what that means. However, he spent less than three minutes with it. Why did I have to go to the front desk five times to tell them my door lock wasn't working? Something that was obviously simple couldn't be fixed quicker? The desk people just kept saying I must have kept it near my phone. I assure them it was not near my phone. It was beyond frustrating.   They customer service could have been better."}
{"text":"I've stayed here a handful of times. The staff is SO nice. No complaints, it's just not a \"5 star hotel\""}
{"text":"Stayed here  on 4/7 prior to a business meeting.  It had many of the usual Marriott niceties but no Starbucks or availability of coffee that was any better than Folgers or Yuban.  Maybe it's a Wisconsin thing but I thought that nearly every Marriott had reliable, dark roasted coffee.  The room was OK except that they put me in a second floor room that had windows which started at about 5 feet above the floor and the only view was of air conditioning/heating units and I am a lifetime Platinum.  I am not sure if the desk clerk felt it made little difference or what but this is not a crown jewel by any means.  I understand that this place was a Holiday Inn previously but usually hotels converted to the Marriott brand are better than this one was."}
{"text":"Stained sheets, hair and food byproduct on nightstand When we got our replacement sheets there was no offer to change them as they were thrust into our hands. Burned out lightbulbs and towels that look like what I use to dry off the dog."}
{"text":"I dont why folks complained about this place but for a Marriott, it is great!!  So e say its far from the center of Madison but its not that far from UW campus and it actually is conveniently located near a lot of eateries and the mall.    Staff was friendly, walking in it looks like the Embassy Suitee set up with the elevators facing inward and the center is the rest/bar.    If you check on line, you'll get some great deals.  The only issue I saw (if it really is an issue) is that the bathrooms are dated a bit and can use a face lift."}
{"text":"This is in regards to their Events Department -   I had my wedding reception here last year. I complained about the management and received little compensation for all that had gone wrong.   In the 6 months it took to begin planning my wedding reception to briefly following the reception I had 3 different events coordinators. The first two were amazing, but they left for good reason, the hotel events department was barely a-float.   There's literally a list of things that went wrong, but the two most concerning:  1) The hired serving staff (many from temp agencies) didn't do their jobs!  2) One of the hired staff were high/drunk, and when he and others were asked for help by my family were giving them sass and they still didn't help.   During the wedding, all I saw was how things were going wrong. So unfortunately, I didn't enjoy majority of my reception. When you spend all that time planning and spending $$$ and things are being executed half ass or not at all.. it's pretty distressful for an already stressed bride. I complained about this, but it wasn't until I got in touch with Marriott International that anyone called me back. They admitted they were going through many staff changes and apologized for the various incidents.   When you spend about $14,000 for SOLELY service and drinks (we catered food). I expect top notch service. My overall bill still had the 22% service gratuity (which they deserved NONE of - which I argued). In the end they reimbursed me $990 which was half the service gratuity. I hate to be ungrateful but that's ridiculous.    My only reason to write this review is because I wish I had known that their events services had gone downhill in past few years. I held an event there in 2010 and the events coordinator at the time, Diana??, and the service were great. People plannng events here should ask the following questions:  1) Are they still using temps and what experience/requirements do they have? 2) If things don't go right (which they have someone from the staff on floor during your events - so they can see it themselves), how can they offer compensation or fix the situation??  At the end - the temps were what were blamed for all the awful service (not clearing plates - my family cleared plates, serving drinks in CANS - when i made it a point everything should be served in glassware, etc...) So that's who I would ask the most questions about.   I hope that things change for the Marriott in the future. They used to be one of the best places to hold large scale events in Madison. In the end, I do wish them the best in getting back to where they once used to be."}
{"text":"I stay here for several days every year for a conference that's held in this hotel. I've always had decent service here and the rooms are average size but clean! My only wish is that they had rooms with kitchenettes! For economical reasons I like to keep food in the room and it's frustrating staying somewhere all week and having to have the front desk microwave your left-overs for you. They did, however, move a mini-fridge into my room at my request which was nice. Also, really great restaurants in the area which I have been very pleased with!"}
{"text":"A bare bones hotel for a Marriott. Pros - comfortable bed and they were aware of my request for a foam pillow. Also nice - walking distance from other restaurants and chain shopping. Cons - no bottled water in the room (even for purchase), no airport shuttle before 6:30am. And - as a side note re using Marriott points - how is that every time I use points, I end up right next to the elevator? Every. Single. Time. Even in a barely occupied hotel."}
{"text":"Mediocre hotel. The sheets don't smell very fresh and they don't give enough towels. The food from the restaurant is also not too good, they gave me raw potatoes with my dinner and after I sent then back they brought me burnt potatoes. The noise from the lobby can echo throughout the hotel at night and may wake you up, no matter how high up your room is if you're a light sleeper. The staff that drive the shuttle, especially Michael, are very friendly and make the stay better."}
{"text":"Would recommend this hotel. Beds are comfy, rooms are nice and clean, staff is very accommodating and goes above & beyond what's expected. We loved Tomeka at the front desk :)"}
{"text":"I stayed in 3 hotels in 3 different cities in the last 3 days. This hotel was by far the best. The staff were so nice and polite, it almost felt weird. They upgraded our rooms to corner suites for no charge and we won money vouchers when checking in. This hotel is big and beautiful, 10 stories tall. Three is a concierge room for gold and platinum members on the 10th floor where they have free beverages discounts at happy hour on drinks with free finger food, cheese and salad. It was a nice lounge with comfy chairs and couch with TV and a computer. They Al's have a staff member cater to the guests as they arrive. The rooms were clean, the staff were super polite, I haven't been called sir so many times. They gave me a corkscrew to open up my bottle of wine. Some hotels do not have one, which is frustrating sometimes. I took many pictures to show the size of the place and the common areas. I took nice shots of the pool and whirlpool which was relaxing last night. I would come back again."}
{"text":"I booked a room at this hotel, I am a Marriott Platinum for life. On the Marriott website it changed dates on me, and I did not catch it. I was booking for a later date. The website booked me for the 6th of February, I was booking for 3 weeks later. I caught the error the next day and called the hotel. I spoke to a kid by the name of Ryan. He was the most arrogant, obnoxious and rude person I have ever spoken to! He would not refund my room charge, would not let me use it for my visit later in the month! He is definitely a person where his front desk job went right to his head! I have 8 other people traveling with me. I immediately called every one and told them not to book at this hotel! First time I have had a Marriott employee treat me poorly!"}
{"text":"This place needs a facelift. Our room was so worn out that the wallpaper is streaked with fading, the shower head only partially worked, and you could feel the springs in the mattress. Additionally, the worst concierge lounge of any Marriott property. Arrived for breakfast at *8:30am to find a couple slices of melon and a few stray pieces of toast left. There was also some cold cereal, but no milk.  Nothing was replenished. The attendant never greeted us.   I settled for coffee and one piece of toast, and scraped up a stray apple from a bowl across the room.  The next morning was worse, and from then on spent the rest of my time allowing enough time in our day to go find a place to grab breakfast offsite.  Housekeeping...good luck. They will either arrive at 7am or 4pm on alternating days. And you'll be lucky if you get your trash taken out.  Front desk staff is always kind. Good luck finding parking if there is a convention..no reserved spots for hotel guests. Depressing fitness center.  It's the only full-service Marriott in the area, but wondering if the close-by Residence Inn or Springfield suites are any better because while adequate, this place depresses me."}
{"text":"Worst marriott experience in twenty years of traveling. The hotel manager is a joke and very rude. I complained about the service at the hotel and asked for the phone number to complain. He responded by threatening to call the police. Just crazy to think this hotel would rather call the police on a Gold member than give the number to customer service."}
{"text":"i stay here every time i visit middleton for work.  its close by, they have a shuttle that takes me to work, its clean, quiet, and the staff is very nice.  prices are pretty good especially when you have AAA.  it has that mariott style look and furniture.  theres a bar and restaurant in the lobby for convenience.  a fitness room and indoor pool that i think is open 24/7."}
{"text":"This has been some of the best and most understanding staff I have dealt with at a hotel. Steve, the manager personally came to help clean up after my 6 year old got sick. It wasn't pretty but he was such a gem. Reassured me that it wasn't a problem, after profusely apologized. He was so calm and collected. He even personally brought back some Sierra Mist, water, and crackers for my son, so I didn't have to leave his side. Would recommend him and the hotel to anyone visiting or just passing through."}
{"text":"We stayed here recently on business and despite the multiple negative reviews I thought we would give it a shot. On arrival the reception desk was very friendly and set us up on the 10th floor adjacent to the concierge lounge. Shortly after checking in the reception desk called up to us to see how the room was. Overall the room was nice although definitely needs a renovation. The beds were comfortable and the TV had an adequate number of channels.  The only downside of the hotel was that the thermostat and did not allow us to adequately cool the room leading us to open the window resulting in the songs of multiple birds starting at 5 AM. The lobby was nicely redone with a large bar area that we did check out that night and had great service for a reasonable rate.  Despite the hotel rooms needing a overhaul the staff at the Marriott were exemplary. Being there for only one night the gentleman at the front desk remembered my name and checked with us to see if we had a pleasant stay. They made the check out process very simple and the location is easily accessible with multiple restaurants surrounding them."}
{"text":"Typical Marriott hotel.  But now they charge you $8 per day to park your car ??!! Really"}
{"text":"I would imagine things would be different if I stayed here when they did not have a convention in town but I did!  Checked in to a room on the 6th floor (out of 10).  I had pounding and banging all round me due to remodeling.  They did finish by late afternoon but the hallways were full of beds and other room furniture.  Besides being unsightly, that wasn't a big deal.  My problems started at night  and the next morning.     When the meeting in one of the ballrooms ended apparently most of the people didn't have enough!  Because of the set up of he hotel every room in the hotel faces the bar.  Even though the bar is on the ground floor the noise funnels up and it becomes a big echo chamber!  Noise continued until about 1am.  I'm not sure if I was pissed because I couldn't sleep or if I was just jealous that I sounded like they were having a lot of fun!  The next morning was a JOKE!  Trying to leave wad impossible.  Why they would build a hotel with 10 floors and only 2 elevators is beyond me!  With people checking out, going to breakfast or just moving around it was Impossible to get on an elevator unless you were on the top 2 floors.  People were lined up on every floor trying to get somewhere.  The smart people started getting on using the \"up\" button and just going for a ride.  I finally have up and lugged my bags down six floors of stairs. What I found has a huge line of others doing the same.  I felt like a refugee!!!  Some women a head of me were having troubles because they had multiple bags.  Eventually one of them fell.... I wasn't pretty.    I found that this hotel looked nice, had a nice pool.  But I would never stay here on a weekend or when it was busy ever again!  They need to find a away to build another elevator and bite the bullet and shut the bar down much earlier or move it into one of the ballrooms."}
{"text":"This review of the Madison Marriott West focuses on the group event services of this facility and not the guest rooms.  I recently attended an evening Board meeting and a one-day conference at this hotel.  The majority of the sales and catering staff at the Marriott were wonderful to work with.  This was the first time we hosted at event at this location.  The responsiveness of the staff was superb in setting up the event.  There were proactive in keeping our group on track with logistical issues leading up to the event.  On the day of the event, they checked in on us frequently and promptly addressed any concerns our group had.  We had some problems with the reservations agents indicating that no rooms were available at the conference rate.  The other problem has to do with the layout of the conference rooms.  There is one conference room (the Monona Room) located by the front desk, far away from all the other meeting rooms.  On the day before the event, you guessed it; the Marriott staff moved us to that room.  The calendar of events is not conspicuous, so on the day of the event, all the conference attended entered the facility through the conference center doors and wandered about searching for the Monona Room.  Like most conference facility, the food was a mixed bag.  Things I liked: * I enjoyed the caesar salad served with lunch with fresh greens (no iceberg lettuce), tangy dressing and herbed croutons that did not go overboard with the salt or garlic.  * Other than the overcooked noodles, the penne pasta with mushroom, spinach, goat cheese, pine nuts and roasted red pepper cream was a well-executed dish.  * While the filling had a bit too much citrus flavor, kudos to the kitchen staff for serving us a cannoli with a crunchy shell, a rarity on the conference food circuit.  Things I didn't: * The rigatoni with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and arriabiatta sauce lacked the finesse of the aforementioned penne pasta dish.  With its mushy noodles, overcooked sauce and under-seasoned sausage, there was little to like.  * If you enjoy a heavy does of garlic powder on bread with the texture of a teething biscuit, you would love the garlic bread served with the pasta course.  * My least favorite dish was toasted cheese sandwich served during the planning session the day before the conference.  For $14.95, I expected aged cheddar served on gently grilled slices of artisan sourdough bread.  What I received was very different.  Served barely warm, the bread was soaked in butter and toasted to a brick-like texture that left cuts on the roof of my mouth.  The institutional grade cheddar and provolone cheese had started to congeal by the time the staff served it to me.  The server did not check in with us because she didn't want to interfere with our meeting, preventing me from sending this dish back for a replacement.  The roasted tomato soup, though cool, was the redeeming feature of my meal.  Overall, the experience with the Marriott Madison West was A-OK, based on the positive interactions with the staff, which offset the spotty food quality."}
{"text":"I am back for a week. The hotel could use some love. Apparently the FAU football team is here and I have heard infrequent yelling across the atrium but now at 10pm it is pretty quiet. I have a standard king room this time as most of the hotel is filled up. The standard room is ok. Pretty much the same as the suite but smaller. I was missing the complimentary water bottles but got some from the front desk. The gym has seen better days and there was a water leaking from the ceiling at the entrance but it was quickly attended too. The nice bonus is I am able to get 500 points extra per night for no house keeping. Awesome!!! I am looking forward to a quiet workout tomorrow morning and breakfast."}
{"text":"Great king suite room. Hotel was very clean.   Breakfast in the restaurant was excellent.  The buffet had a good variety of choices included lox, omelettes to order, and fresh fruit.   The only negative was it took quite a bit of time and two calls to get an extra blanket delivered.   Would definitely return if in the area."}
{"text":"Don't just do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. These people are rude and don't care about you and please please don't give them your dry cleaning. They will lose it then tell you to deal with the dry cleaning company that they chose even though you gave them your clothes. Can't believe they think they can do this and get away with it."}
{"text":"The room was fine, obviously outdated but it looks as though they are upgrading currently. The food on the other hand was overpriced and gross. Do yourself a favor and do not order room service. It looked as though it was prepared at a truck stop, nuked and then brought up to my room. I complained, they said sorry and that was it. No new food, no help from the front desk and still charged me for it. Platinum member service my butt."}
{"text":"The manager is rude, and has no concern for guest satisfaction! He brushed me off with my concern regarding a group rate I was supposed to get because I booked 5 days late, mind you my company had its annual banquet here and had over 100 rooms booked just from coworkers! So you would think that he could over look a 5 day late reservation for a company employee who has a event here yearly but guess he's not concerned about return guests to any of his company hotels! I will never stay at a Marriott hotel again so many better options out there!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed and disgusted with this manager and hotel. I totally understand policy but I also understand unforeseen circumstances. I planned on using the reservation but when there is a 100% chance of a snow storm with up to 7 inches of accumulation I am very hesitant to travel anywhere. But when you are going be charged because they want their money and will take it anyway regardless of circumstances you risk it because that is a lot of money to lose out on. I will never stay at a Marriott (especially this one) ever again nor will I recommend Marriott to anyone ever since they are money hungry."}
{"text":"Overall this is the typical Marriott. I travel quite often and have experienced the much more modernized and renovated Marriott's. The one in Middleton is a bit outdated compared to those, but is still reliable and comfortable. I usually stay here whenever I am in Madison for business.  The hotel has an open atrium with the guest rooms surrounding it going up about 10 floors. I get a little anxious walking down the hallway as one side is open to the atrium.  One a couple of occasions (including this one), I was upgraded to a larger king suite. They are huge, with space for a couch and lounge chair. The bathroom is about the same size as the other guest rooms (tiny).  The concierge lounge (on floor 10) is also standard and consistent. I like coming here for the breakfast in the morning, and for the dessert and coffee in the evening. There is also a breakfast buffet in the restaurant in the mornings. I have had dinner downstairs in the bar, and the food is okay. It's not 5 star Michelin quality but is decent for a hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"We made 2 reservations in our name, and cancelled one, as our father decided to use his own card. I cancelled on Oct 5th, well before the 48 hours, I still have the record of the call on my cell records. Called the 800-321-2211 and spoke with the rep  to cancel. She passed me directly to this property, and I spoke to a guy who assured me he would cancel.   When we checked in tonight we were told it was never cancelled and the manager was so rude and smug and obviously thought I was lying. He never for a moment acted as if he cared. He frankly acted like some big time \"boss\" and handed us the bill with a kiss my a$$ expression on his face. I am disputing the charge and will cancel our Marriott rewards visa if it doesn't get removed.  IT\"S NOT EVEN ABOUT THE money at this point, as I told the general manager  on the phone, if they refunded me, I would DONATE THE $150.00 to St Judes hospital. They don't give a darn.  Now for the hotel... It is loud and noisy, seems like lots of kids running around. and there were insects in the room. Decor is \"70's Mardi-Gras tacky.  Watch out for the automatic revolving door, it about hit a couple older guests trying to get out. I couldn't get out fast enough."}
{"text":"I. Like. This. Hotel. If no shuttle is available to pick you up from the airport, they pay for your cab. The front desk staff is quick and attentive which is exactly what you want after a day of air travel. Room service was very friendly and the food was YUM. The toilet handle was misbehaving and while it took some time for engineering to fix it, they were beyond apologetic and did all of the things you'd expect a good hotel to do - either offer a room change/upgrade or other free stuff. The hotel is in Middleton so don't book a room here and then complain that it's not downtown. Look at a map. How is it the hotel's fault that you are in need of additional IQ points?   So many Yelpers like to complain about every dumb, little thing without understanding that it's not about perfection, it's about how a business responds to a problem. This Marriott is not as modern as some others, but I'd pick a clean room and good service over some spiffy wallpaper and Berber carpet any day."}
{"text":"This hotel was a mistake from beginning to end. The rooms were par at best, no refrigerator, no microwave and bad coffee.  Despite making reservations well in advance of our event, the customer reservations were wrong.  My real issue was with the accounting department, they totally messed up my companies master billing for our customer rooms and it took 10 days and 6 calls to accounting and the general manager to get it right. Honestly I am not convinced our billing ever did get corrected. My AmEx is a mess of over charges and credits and I am just praying that my expense report makes through the company auditors."}
{"text":"Lumpy mattresses - no microwave - no refrigerator in rooms- exorbitant prices for their restaurant-I was charged 15.00 for a bowl of oatmeal, coffee, and 4 oz juice.  Their expo center tried to charge us 35.00 a person per day for using their WiFi , when they clearly advertise free WiFi."}
{"text":"Um...What is everybody complaining about?  I just stayed at this hotel and was skeptical due to the negative reviews.  The hotel is great, like many Marriott stand alones the furniture is not brand new but is actually solid rather than particle board.  The bed was comfortable along with the furniture.  I was disappointed with the old ironing board and the lack of refrigerator in the room but both those are easily fixable.  If you are not a Marriot rewards member there is a internet charge, but just sign up for free and then the internet is free or hot spot to your phone.  I'm gold and enjoyed the concierge lounge, its so nice to check in and be able to eat without thinking and decompress from traveling."}
{"text":"Rude! Rude! Rude! Manager was so rude, insensitive, arrogant and bullying it's not even funny! I would NEVER stay here!"}
{"text":"Spacious, clean, extremely friendly staff, good restaurant, decent gym.  I just checked in about two hours ago and I have noticed several wait staff checking on customers.  That said, no complaints so far.  I travel pretty frequently for work and I must say its definitely one of the better Marriotts that I have stayed at."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and clean rooms. Proximity to lots of restaurants and highways. We love the fresh fruits and omelette station at breakfast! Swimming pool is warm...definitely a hotel we would go back with the kiddos!"}
{"text":"To give this location one star is being generous. As a lifetime Platinum MRW member, the service level of this property leaves a lot to be desired, starting first with its 48 hour cancellation policy. The assistant manager, Stephen S. needs some behavior modification training along with a lesson or two in how to properly represent the Marriott brand, especially with loyal Marriott customers. I used to stay here a minimum of 4 times a year on business but after they refused to cancel my reservation within 24 hours due to a family emergency, I will take my business elsewhere and tell all my business associates and friends to do the same."}
{"text":"I traveled here for a week on business and I was booked this hotel on short notice. When I first checked in, the manager working the front desk told me my king sized bed room was gone, and would I settle for 2 queens? Since I was traveling alone, I asked what good having two beds would do me and she worked her magic getting me upgraded to a suite with a king size bed, very nice of her. The room was larger and had a desk, chairs and a couch but despite having all this unnecessary space, there were some issues. The coffee maker did not work, the heater did not work (room stayed at 70* despite my setting it to 80*), the bathroom door was so tight it was hard to get in and out of the bathroom, and toilet was backed up every morning and even overflowed. While the staff were extremely nice, there were several issues I had with the services provided. Almost every meal was forgetting at least one small factor (not a big deal, but noticeable when you're there for 5 days) and the shuttle service was not a nice ride, nor did it remain to the schedule. It was set to pick everyone up from Epic at 5pm. It left me at Epic in Verona one day driving off at 445pm, and the next day didn't show up until 530pm. It also is advertised they will shuttle you to and from the airport but I requested to be driven at 545am to the airport and they said the diver doesn't get there until 6am and can not do it. Overall, for a \"luxury\" hotel that cost my company over $200 per night, in a suite that should have been $400 per night, I did not enjoy my time, (something usually hard to say while on an all expensed paid trip)."}
{"text":"Before I booked here, i was about to stay at a crappy hotel off the highway that look like it was about to fall apart. I just happen to browse online on priceline and got this place book. I was already happy at this point that I am staying at a Marriott because I have always had great experiences at all the Marriotts across the country, but what happens next makes me love this location even more. I am extremly happy I didnt let some of the previous reviews deter me from booking here. When i arrived, my check in process was easy, the front desk was friendly, and I was able to check in early (which I was on a 16 hour drive cross country so i was ready to rest). My room was clean, the bathroom is immaculate, and it had everything i needed. Even the smallest things such as hair dryer, ethernet wire, and the ginger orange smell hair products made this stay VERY pleasant. I wanted to bring my work computer up to my room and the front desk gentleman was very helpful in assisting me with all my questions and helping with the cart so i can take it upstairs. When I travel, I dont expect hotel staff to wait on my hand and feet and I am not a needy guest, as long as they are professional and willing to help when i ask for it, I am satisfied with my stay. I asked for a different coffee maker since it wasnt working and they brought me another right to my room within a few minutes, thats what i call attentive and prompt service. All in all, I highly recommend this Marriottt."}
