{"text":"This place is great. Ordered delivery from them and it was fast, and the pizza was still hot and gooey cheese. The delivery guy, kirk I think, was very professional and was a speedy driver. He called when he was here, cause he delivered to the ballys hotel. Super nice guy, and it shoes what kind of establishment they have based on the people that midtown hires. 5 stars for yummy food and great service."}
{"text":"What a let down. Bought the groupon after reading reviews and looking at the website. The bar itself was clean and looked nicer than what belongs in the neighborhood. We were greeted by the bartender whom we ended up feeling very sorry for by the end of our experience. Not only was she the only bartender but was the cook as well. We were soon informed that the website wasn't correct because the owner hasn't updated it. Also, many of the items on the menu weren't available because the owner hasn't been around as he just had a baby. We ordered a pizza and wings to go and a couple of bloody Mary's while we waited. The drinks were good but the bartender was working hard because of other patrons and our food order. I overheard the bartender let other patrons know that she was out of their preferred alcohol. Now the food: the \"pizza\" was a small flat bread that got cold really fast and was served in a box usually reserved for an extra large pizza. The food is mediocre at best and there are much cooler bars to hang at downtown. Sorry, I just can't recommend to anyone. The bartender was nice though, she just didn't have the tools to do her job."}
{"text":"Wandered in here with a friend while he was in town for a convention! Since I'm new to vegas, I like to write reviews! Good and bad! The bar is very nice..I was surprised to see how classy of a joint it was! However I was extremely disappointed with the service! Some guy introduced himself as the bar manager and it all went downhill from there! The drinks are a bit overpriced, we came in during \"happy hour\", ordered a pizza and it was completely wrong! The manager had the pizza remade and it was wrong yet again!!! You think they would come a drink or something for the screw up! Also, one drink per $20 in gaming (I've never heard of this)..he failed to inform of us this \"rule\" and we got a hefty bill at the end! That explains why he was overly pressuring us to order drinks! The bar made me feel very uncomfortable! I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone! Classy joint but the service is not classy at all..bad food, bad manager or whatever he was, bad service, and overall just a bad experience! However, there was a drunken old blonde lady that provided quite the entertainment! Only highlight of that experience...most likely won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick lunch after flying into L V and used yelp for restaurant suggestions.  Found Midway easily  & the decor is wam & welcoming. But the staff & owner were even more wonderful, very attentive & appreciated our patronage . The sandwiches, pizza, specials were great. And we enjoyed \"trying out\" the pastries
which were light & tasty. Really enjoyed the meal & you will too!  Cozier than most places in in Las Vegas!  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Really bad service and food. No wonder it's out of business. The kitchen crew absolutely sucks. Food undercooked, raw pizza dough, pepperoni raw. YUCK!!!! Was there 3 days ago and the manager Kevin was oh so very rude. Many customers say so as well. Never again!"}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone could give this place a bad review... Just Cause your life sucks doesn't mean you need to try and deface a wonderful business!

I had called Kevin the GM and told him I needed to throw a party for my customers and co-workers, and boy I was impressed.
Food epic, staff epic, event epic..
People are still talking about the friendliness of the staff and the intimacy if the event.
I would recommend Midtown to all Vegas locals and travelers alike.
Thank you midtown ...
Kevin and Lindsay are the bomb!!"}
{"text":"Love this spot for delivery! They'll make any type of pizza you want...including this lobster Thermidor pizza amped up with carne asada, jalepenos, cilantro, and avocado. I like to call it the Kat Daddy...;) Pizza arrives hot and service is excellent."}
{"text":"i absolutely love this place! my fav hangout place in vegas..good people, great staff, and excellent food..pizza, salads, and wings..all amazing! classy little place to come chill :-D"}
{"text":"Here we go again!!  I live across the street.  I have been here four times and order food 7. Delivery sucked! ...  So now we are going to fix it.  Bartenders where chicks in underwear.... We are going to fix it.  Everything they say is stupid.  I came in about two weeks ago late after work. The bartender  was cool as hell.  I came back  just for him a week later??? He gone.  2 girls are gone, a cook and a partridge in a pear tree.  I think whoever is telling people to hit the \"Bricks\"  need to hit the bricks.  I will never return.  You idiots!  Time for someone to run this place who knows how to run it.  Please sell it to somebody for $20 and get your money back.  So me and all my friends and co workers that live across the street can come back. Been open a week and you have had four people quit!!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The moon hit my eye like a big pizza pie and it was amore after visiting this place.

A hidden gem by Boulevard Mall- this is the spot for pizza. Carne Asada or Margherita Pizza are served piping hot with a side of awesome bartender. Forget Metro Pizza, Midtown is much more chic and a place for adults to dine without the hustle bustle of families with children. 

On Wednesdays they have half off bottles of wine! Stay tuned for future check-ins because this is my new spot for a pizza pie."}
{"text":"The pizza here is absolutely divine. I also suggest the Ghirardelli fudge brownie, it is delicious."}
{"text":"Super cute place! 

My friend actually painted the designs on the outside of the building, super cute!

We did not eat here we just met some friends for drinks. Hubby and I shared a bottle of Merlot and it was appropriately priced at about $20.

I really love the decor in here and there tv's are hung in a fashion that watching a game would be easy.

They have a \"Wine Wednesdays\" plan coming up so I will def go to that when they start it :)

I will update my review the next time I go!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars. Came to this place because I pass it on the way to work. It looks like a cool, hip, place to hang out and it definitely seems like it should be on the strip of bars downtown. 

They also advertise they sell coffee, pastries 24 hours but when we went there, the pastry case wasn't set up and lit, and to my dismay the poor pastries were suffocating in saran wrap sitting in the pastry case. 

The interior decor was very modern and everything was new. Since it recently opened (~3weeks from when we visited), there were empty spaces on the walls where the TVs should have been.  The gaming wasn't installed yet either.

Service was OK. Our bartender wasn't really knowledgeable about the drinks on hand and right away we noticed they only had Guinness on tap- which happened to be out that night but we only discovered that after we ordered the Guinness. I noticed that the owner/manager was there, he helped our bartender find the wine that I had ordered because she had no clue where it was. 

The place we extremely lit. I would have appreciated it more if it was a little dimmer. I'm a big fan of the low light setting, because it doesn't feel like someone could watch your every move. 


For food, we ordered two different pizzas: 

1. The Midtown- classic margarita pizza, the pizza was really good the tomatoes were giant chunks. 

2. Lobster pizza was definitely a hit! It's probably the main reason I would come back here. There were chunks of tasty lobster on top (not tiny little pieces as you would expect) and for a wooping $15 the pizza was totally worth it. No where on the strip could you find a lobster pizza at that price and that tasty. I totally recommend this pizza!

I'd come back in a couple of months when everything is set up a little better."}
{"text":"Found this place just east of the strip. It's a small bar that serves great pizza. My wife has a knack of finding these \"hole in the wall\" places. 
There are quite a few TVs around the bar. The decor really matches a modern style bar with a wide variety of spirits and beers. 
The prices for the pizza averaged $12.95 and the salad was around $5.95. Happy hour is 4-6 pm where all dine-in pizzas are 1/2 off. That's a deal!!!!  
We ate a spicy Hawaiian: ham, pineapple, jalape√±os. If you spicy, you gotta eat this. 
The 2nd pizza was the Tuscan: chicken breast, spinach, garlic, red onion, mushrooms. Both pizzas had good portions of fresh toppings. 
The customer service was excellent. The waiter/bartender was very nice and personable. She checked on us regularly and also would also strike up a conversation. 
This is one of the best pizzas we've eaten, customer service was awesome, and good prices. What more can you ask for?
This is a must visit.

{"text":"Been in here a handful of times, but walking across the street from my apartment to watch games and have a few, I, a 53- year- old man who didn't bring ID, was carded at an empty bar. Won't be darkening their door again."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else, anywhere else. I came in with a $20 Groupon for takeout and asked for a refund- it was that bad.

Ordered a house salad with added chicken, plus a 10-piece order of wings with Midtown sauce. The salad was covered in croutons, hiding the fact that they covered up rotten lettuce and spoiled vegetables. The chicken on top was hard, dry, and crunchy as if it had been made days ago. The wings were tiny and the sauce was a basic mild sauce- and sparingly applied. I swear one was actually a sauced bone, there was literally nothing on it.

 I realize it's a bar, but if it's so dark inside that you can't tell if the food you're serving is spoiled, you shouldn't be selling food. If your employees are really so clueless to keep serving food in this condition, they should have their food handlers card revoked."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!  I visit LV every week for work and have my normal haunts. But this place just jumped to the top of the list.  Ronan was a great friendly and cute bartender.  Happy hour prices were great and I can t wait for them to get the gaming in house.  You MUST come VISIT and STAY!"}
{"text":"Midtown disappointed me. If my friends and I weren't so timid and nice we would have walked out. What they advertise online- hours and menu items- is not accurate. They didn't have fries. It didn't look like they had pastries or coffee. Numerous things we asked for that were actually on the menu were out. No beer on tap. When we ordered sliders we got one, well, slider. I do have to say that the lobster pizza was really good. My husband and I shared our slider and the pizza. It was about $20 for that and we were not full so I don't recommend sharing. The waitress was having all kinds of problems processing our transaction. I felt embarrassed that we made our friends go there with us."}
{"text":"so far so good! great looking place, nice bar, and the the pizza i had was awesome!
i will definitely be back, especially since it is only a few blocks away."}
{"text":"they get 5 stars because they are as good as they get.  So glad I happened to stumble upon them a month ago.  took my boyfriend with his discriminating NY pizza taste buds.  Even he was impressed.  Pizzas was balanced with just the perfect amount of sauce, cheese, meat (for him) and veggies (for me).  Had their Caesar salad which was delish!!  Had such a great evening there. Relaxing in a bar with a sophisticated ambiance but no pretentiousness there.  Had such a pleasant experience that I decided to throw a surprise birthday party for a friend there.  Unbeknownst to me they will post photos, a playlist, video messages and a birthday message on their large screen T.V.'s for a special touch.  They even let us go the extra mile and put up our balloons, flamingos, have our own cake and let us add our own touch.  This all made for a very special evening and everyone loved it.  I kept asking all of our guests what they thought of the food and everyone of them enjoyed the delicious pizza, salads (by the way, I highly recommend the Midtown).  Kevin and Roland really hit a home run with us.  Without any reservation, I recommend Midtown for a special evening.  They are truly a hidden gem.  I want everyone to know about them.  We have a downtown here in Vegas now let's make Midtown the place to be with swanky joints like this.  I also love the fact that they don't have gaming only because its refreshing and you don't think you're in Vegas when you are there.  If I can recommend anything, I would recommend that they have some vegetarian appetizer options such as zucchini strips, or some type of veggie dish for us Veggies/Vegans.  Other than that, give them a whirl for your next shindig.  You'll be pleasantly surprise."}
{"text":"I just ordered again using the Eat24 app, but this time I called right after to make sure it went through, and it did.
My order came so fast, and was hot and DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"I had a groupon for a large pizza, salad and 2 drinks, all for $25! I came here on a Thursday night and was surprised to see nobody else in the bar, which was kind of a bummer. Not a single other customer (until the end of my meal when an older couple walked in), despite all the awesome reviews! But the pizza and salad were SOOOO good! Barbecue chicken pizza and Caesar salad... YUM! 

Good food, good service, good prices, cute bartender! Good job Midtown!"}
{"text":"Despite much trepidation with the location of this place. I have tried many times to LOVE it and they never fail to disappoint.  Don't let the new gaming (tap tap machines) and new management fool you.  They continue to be a huge disappointment. Sorry and they still have some serious problems.  Still one of the best pizzas in the area but good luck with no customer service!"}
{"text":"This spot is bullshit. They said 45 mins I waited 2 hrs, no show.unprofessional and unbelievable ! This would not fly in LA, get real people. If you're going to say 45 mins it better be 45 mins or less. Not over 2 hrs!! What a disgrace. I was going to leave a nice review but heres to you KEVIN, who took my order. f**k you AssHole!   NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"The pizza these guys make is fantastic. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere nice a chill. These guys are vegan friendly which is a plus."}
{"text":"First time ordering, and I unfortunately had a bad experience. The person on the phone told me it would be about an hour for delivery because they were backed up. I have worked at a restaurant so I understand this.  After about an hour and 15 mins I patiently called to see how much longer the wait would be. The gentleman on the phone apologized and told me the order in front of us had given the wrong address, so she was delayed an additional 15 mins or so. He apologized which. Was nice, but the situation should of been nullified with more than just an apology. Another 10 mins went by and I received a call from the driver asking our location, in which she was very short and unprofessional. Another 15 mins and she finally showed up. When we playfully said to her, \"did you forget about us?\" She responded wiith, \"no. Just stupid people in front of you.\" After paying her, and still tipping her an adequate 20%, I asked if my side of ranch was in the box. It wasn't. There was never an apology or so much as some way to make it up to us, like half off your next pizza. In addition, our pizza was definitely not hot by this time.

 Customer service could really be fine tuned. Not to mention if it takes such a long time for deliveries, they might want to consider additional delivery driver to a) nullify situations like this, and b) ease up longer delivery wait times during rush hours."}
{"text":"Ohhh boi, they have a chocolate wheat beer that is so yummy.   The bartender JC is always pleasant, and full of energy."}
{"text":"Lobter pizza is a joke. 
Hope the owner knows that his pizza maker doesn't care about his business at all. 
My pizza had like 5 tiny pieces of lobster. 
1 on each slice."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this business a higher rating...I really do. These are good people who are trying to create a cool bar with great food. I want them to succeed. I really do.

But there are problems. 

I ordered a pizza. It was okay. It should have been as good as Settebello or Ferraros for the price, but it wasn't. 
The crust was waaay too thick. The toppings were good, and fresh, and it was edible. But it should have been GREAT dammit. And it was just okay.

The other problem is that the food menu is quite limited. All the pizzas are specifically-designed, although the charming woman behind the bar said one could modify them if so desired, even though it wasn't clear that was an option on the menu.

For example, they have wagyu sliders (good) but no half-pound pub burger. No fries. 
Hello? Go to Dispensary. Go to Badger (Rumrunner). Go to any number of neighborhood bars, who have artery-clogging, delicious bar food. 
Go to Fat Choy, which is in a dingy, smoke-filled, casino of the living dead, but has duck bao, potstickers, and a monster fat choy burger!
Even Naked City Pizza, which is in one of the diviest of dive bars of Vegas, is constantly creating inventive dishes like the Turducken Burger.

In a crowded, competitive marketplace, a business has to find a way to stand out.

Midtown COULD be the coolest hang in the area. 
But they have more work to do.

I'm told their official opening is not until Feb. 1. Between now and then, I hope they have some brainstorming sessions centered around the question: How can we be great and different, and stand out from the crowd.

I wish them well. 
But for my neighborhood pizza outing, I'll be going just down the road to Sicili's on Twain. Tastier and cheaper."}
{"text":"We held our bi-monthly Yelp Book Club meeting at Midtown last night and I was quite impressed.  It's a small place.  It's very nicely designed and very classy looking.  The bar runs along the west side of the room and on the east side, there's a run of booth seats.  There are tables by the booth seats and there are very comfortable stools to sit at the tables.

I had eaten at home and all I wanted was a diet Coke.  The barkeep last night was a very delightful young woman with a tremendous smile and a very welcoming demeanor.  She got my Coke and then some of the members of the group started to arrive.

While I was there, one of the partners in this new business came by and introduced himself and the executive chef stopped by to talk about the menu.  Everyone was very polite, friendly, and accommodating.  It was a pleasant place for us to discuss our book and for those that had food, they enjoyed what they had.  I have uploaded a photo of some meatballs one of the members ordered.  They have a meatball sandwich, but all she wanted was a few meatballs--no bread, no cheese, just the meatballs.  The plate shows how well they complied with her special request.

I'll be back.  I have to try their lobster pizza.  I was disappointed no one wanted to order one to share last night."}
{"text":"It's a cool little new spot that is part bar, restaurant, coffee, that is open 24 hours! So basically almost everything you need anytime of day. 

There is a bar and tables with very comfortable seating, think plush. The music is both jukebox or radio top 40. 

They plan on installing more TVs soon and in the end it would be a total of 6, making it a pretty awesome sports bar. 

I think they are going to make a killing once the LV convention center attendees catch wind of this place. For sure it beats the food court! (Correction, I wasn't driving so I thought we were closer to the Convention Center. It's a bit of a walk but I think  worth it) 

Food wise, they have salads, pizzas, and some appetizers. We came from dinner so I didn't eat anything. They have a Lobster Pizza that's supposed to be their specialty... next time."}
{"text":"Visited a few nights ago, the bartender was friendly and the pizza was great.  Nice clean place just outside LVCC, will stop again!"}
{"text":"eh.. after 2 experiences.. I am not impressed. I wanted to be impressed.. I gave it ALL a second chance, because - \"things happen,\" and your first experience at a similar-style establishment cannot live up to the best you may have had -  ...  but no...It wasn't good. 

First time, my meal included the tip of a sharply cut plastic squeeze bottle that I bit down on while chewing, (not un-painful,) and the second time - the order was not right, and when I called to fix it - we were asked to pay for the mistake they sent us, and we were also asked to pay for the actual dish we had ordered (that was the wrong order when it arrived 58 minutes later)  It's just not quality service.. when the wrong order came.. the delivery guy  said \" we gave you a larger pizza because the order took so long.. then the order arrived, and it wasn't what we ordered. SO fail on most levels. 

I'm sorry to sound mean about it.. but spending money on sub par is not what we should have to be doing. Happy Eating To You!"}
{"text":"Dude, came here on Saturday night at 11:30 and it was closed, WTF?  I give 2 stars because a closed bar can't defend itself and who knows, it could have been awesome?"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall bar with pretty good pizza! 

I've been here twice - one of my girlfriends lives in the complex across the street so we've walked over for some drinks before in the past. I went the other day and we had Kevin, the owner, take great care of us! 

He was super friendly and attentive. He kept coming by our table to top off our wine glasses which we were loving. We ordered a supreme pizza and buffalo wings. The pizza was surprisingly good and the wings were tasty but tiny little things. They looked 1/2 the size of what normally is served in a restaurant. 

We missed happy hour by an hour but I saw both pizzas and wings were 1/2 off during it!! (And $1 off drinks) Next time I'll have to go during happy hour to get another pizza and to go see Kevin!"}
{"text":"I love this bar and what it's trying to become! The owner and tenders are all extremely friendly and seem genuinely happy to see you. The drinks have great prices and the atmosphere is perfect. 

I know business may be a bit slow for them, but my roomies and I try to pop in at least once a week. Help give these guys a shot!!!

Oh and wine Wednesday? Give that a shot! Also be sure to check out happy hour Monday- Thursday 4-7. 5 dollar specialty drinks :D"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Monday & had the Thai Chicken pizza.  Very tasty!  Appreciated the julienne vegetables & chicken and wasn't too spicy.  Crust could have been a little crisper; will ask them to leave in oven a few extra minutes next time.  They get a gold star for having Coke products and I got a lemon in my diet Coke without asking.  Bartender was polite and efficient.  I did get there a little early (11:30 am) and their meatballs weren't quite ready and I may have those next time. 

Overall great experience.  Parking appeared to be limited; I counted about 11 - 12 spots and don't know how it would work if they were busy as there's no street parking on Desert Inn here.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. When it is empty, it is amazing! The owner took excellent care of us and we vowed to return. 
I REALLY love this pizza! I really don't care for the prostitutes showing my man her boobs or the constant smoking. I guess I will have to do take out!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!! The minute I walked in the door to pickup my pizza, which was awesome btw, I was greeted at the door by the owner Kevin. You would have thought I was one of his long time regular customers. I was a little early and my pizza wasn't quite ready so I ordered a drink at the bar. Immediately I felt like I was back home in my regular watering hole, everyone was friendly and were glad I was there. I ended up eating my pizza there which I will have say was excellent, cooked to perfection you would have thought I was in NYC having a pizza in the Broncz. I ended up staying 3 hours and had one the best times I have ever had in Vegas. This place is a must for your place to visit while in town or if you live here you need to check it out before the line is so long you will have to wait an hour or more to be seated. I will defiantly be putting this place on my short list of places that are a must visit every time I am in town. Great job Kevin and staff keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, great drinks, fun bartenders!"}
{"text":"For you boozy wi-fi warriors, this is the spot for you! I just love a nice bar with a good wi-fi signal, and Midtown is just that. They also have a selection of food, but I did not sample anything on my first visit. However, I was impressed when the Chef came over and said, \"If there is anything you want that's not on the menu, let us know. It's like Italy. We'll try to make it for you.\"

Their cheapest red wine ($5) is delicious. The interior is downright swanky.They have a nice large TV for watching sportand a high-tech jukebox. Our waitress was great. More interesting fun facts: They have wine Wednesdays with 50% off all bottles of wine 5-10pm, and I hear lobster pizza is divine. Late night hours are great too."}
{"text":"Great people, great ambiance and even better food. I love how I can pick the music that plays. Makes it like my own bar, feels good here. Check this new place out, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I went there for wings. I ordered the 10 to go. Got home and the cook can't count there was 8. The price with tip was $13.00. Don't waste your time here. The bartender was arrogant and the place was dead"}
{"text":"I love this place. Can't get enough.!!! When you walk in interior is super chic and inviting. The staff greets you and you feel like you definitely made the right choice by stopping by instead of just driving by because of the exterior looks/location. With that said, staff seems a little disorganized at times. They are not always on the same page. Being a big foddie, this place does not disappoint in that area. Never had anything I didn't like. Even though owner seems to be focusing on  more of a restaurant menu rather than bar menu, I feel there should be some kind of bar menu or at least an appetizer menu. Other than that I would highly recommend a visit.!!!"}
{"text":"Great staff..good pizza..excellent drinks ... And now they have gaming which  only makes it more awesome.  Oh and they have the best bloody Mary mix."}
