{"text":"Excellent bar and awesome food. Bartenders are awesome! Nuff said!!!! What are you waiting for!"}
{"text":"Came for the advertised pasta special. Came in to be told they just aren't doing it. Then received menus with another advertised special,  which again we were told was no longer in affect. We decided not to eat there after this. However I must admit, the immediate smell of smoke upon entering the place was an instant turn off. We were customers drawn by food; we weren't expecting the little dive bar that it was. I just don't think food and smoke mix!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I'm a non-smoker, and that this is a bar that allows smoking.  However my party and I went at 2 PM on a sunny Saturday, and although there was a background smell of smoking, there were no active smokers.  The food was terrific for such a small bar.  My wife and I both had burgers which were charbroiled, ample in size, and delicious.  The fries were also very tasty.  They were of the coated variety, which suited all of us just fine.  My son had the club sandwich which was very generous in the meat department.  Beverages were reasonable.  The table we were seated at was clean and comfortable, although the spacing between tables is a bit close.  Luckily the bar was nearly empty when we ate.  The restrooms, of the \"one-seater\" variety, were clean, but neither the men's or women's rooms had paper towels.  There are 3 large screen TVs above the bar, and since the bar was quiet, we could hear all 3, although the middle larger one was turned up higher than the other 2.  The bartender/server was friendly and didn't allow an empty glass to remain on the table.  Highly recommended for good food at decent prices."}
{"text":"Came to this place to watch a friend play music.  First of all this is a smoking place establishment so if you don't like smoke I suggest you stay away.  Next it is a small place shaped more like a rectangle with a long bar on one side and some tables to the other which are spaced to close together.  Also it is not set up well for any music   The stage is by the door and it's hard to hear or see anyone if you not up close that way. Music was nice and we could hear it fine but there was a table of loud drunk people that would get rowdy from time to time.  We ordered food which included stuffed mushrooms and calamari. Mushrooms were decent but the calamari was bigger then I expected and the taste was ok but they were over cooked and \"rubbery\" a bit.  The bartender was amazing and the service was excellent. Met the wiener and his wife who were super friendly"}
