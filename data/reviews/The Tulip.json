{"text":"This place is a reliable breakfast spot. No line up! It's grime enough for street cred but not enough to make you scared to eat the food! On my last visit I noticed that the owner (management?) took to yelling at her staff...I don't like this...and this alone is why I will not return."}
{"text":"The Tulip has great food. Everything on their menu is delicious. The lunch specials are well priced and enormous!! My only gripe is the parking."}
{"text":"Good for what it is.   It's an old school diner. Prob one of the few of its kind left near the beaches. Food is basic and very reasonably priced for the portions. Nothing fancy for sure but it's decent.   Service is also good though all the servers are a little rough around the edges.   This is not a date place. It's the kind of place you might take your family for a simple Sunday meal."}
{"text":"This place doesnt deserve 1 star. If you fancy a nazi dictatorship this place is for you. Can i substitute pancakes for french toast.....no! Ok, can i have blueberries in my pancakes since you offer it.....no! Ok, can i have a side order and dont bring me the pancakes.....no!....I will never in my life step foot in this terribly run establishment. I hope it shuts down."}
{"text":"Get the gravy on the side! It's super delicious and made for dipping fries..."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and it's always been great. I don't even live in the area anymore but I make a point of coming here when I can."}
{"text":"Ordered the cheesy garlic shrimp, prime rim, and chocolate cake (duh!), and the food was quite good. The prime rib and chocolate cake were excellent, and both highly recommended.  I'm rating this a 2/5 not because of the food or service, but because as a group their inability to split bills is enough to make me not come back as a group again. The 20 minutes spent trying to split the bill 10 ways aside, it would be a 4/5."}
{"text":"Great weekend breakfast spot. It gets busy so be prepared for slow service at times."}
{"text":"It's been about a year since I've been to The Tulip for steak.  I should have waited a bit longer.  While I love the value offered by most of their meals; the steaks are not at the top of this list.  Still, for the money, it's worth the visit if you're going for basic diner food like the roast beef sandwich or burgers.  +ives: decent value, quick service -ives: steaks"}
{"text":"OK... so I went there having heard about the wonderful reputation as being one of the best steak houses in Toronto.  OK  - maybe that was the case in 1975, but WTF?  I can't remember what cut of steak I had, but it was by far not the best steak I had ever had, although I wouldn't call it terrible.  It takes a lot fo screw up steak, but I would not call the Tulip one of the best steak houses in Toronto.  Anyhow - the atmosphere is friendly, and its not horrible, but don't go thinking you are in for the meal of a lifetime."}
{"text":"How is this restaurant recommended in BlogTO's top 10 brunch places in Leslieville?  I went there today for brunch and ordered the peameal bacon and eggs. It came with toast. The peameal bacon is very fatty - I thought the point of it is not to be fatty, otherwise, I would get regular bacon. The eggs are average - although I didn't expect anything else. My recommendation - go to St.Lawrence Market and get the peameal bacon sandwich at The Carsouel Bakery...  The toast was blah, nothing amazing either. I guess the only good thing was the price? It was only $6.50.  The atmosphere was dingy and diner like - which would have been okay, if they had food like a diner. Should have went to Lady Marmalade and waited. There was a reason this restaurant didn't have lineups."}
{"text":"Majority of the populous knows to usually go to the Keg for a good steak, but that its small and overpriced.    What most of Toronto or the GTA don't know that the Tulip is the place to go for a steak.   This little unassuming regular looking diner is where you can get a 24 oz porter house for I think its $32.95 .... versus the keg who charges roughly the same or more for a 12 oz  for the same price or more.  Now that I got your attention, a few things to note firstly:  This is a diner in every sense of the word, the booths are comfortable and you can get a table for  8 comfortably (obviously you should make a reservation).   I recommend you come with your buddies that are meat eaters, but don't take your dates her cause like I said this is a diner in every sense of the word.  But folks that want a cozy neighborhood feel with a diner in the sense like the one you'd see on Seinfeld that makes an amazing steak  --- this is that joint.    This is that hidden joint where I'd make the trek from Markham to downtown Toronto.  You don't have to order the behemoth of a 24 oz porter house, they definitely have more manageable sizes ranging from 8oz, 10oz, 12oz up to 20oz and 24oz  --- I just feel I get my moneys worth and I make sure I don't bother eating lunch before coming here for dinner.  I've been going here for roughly 4-5 years I make the pilgrimage about twice a year minimum.   I don't  know who or if its more than one person who cooks the steaks, but they get my medium rare right EVERY TIME, every freaking time its perfect.  So perfect that I decided to move onto rare steak, cause medium rare just wasn't as juicy as I once found it.  I told the waiter if I'm eating rare steak for the first time -- if I don't like it can you guys cook it till medium rare, no problem.   You can even ask them to warm up your steak, cause sometimes I talk a bit much with friends trying to get through this behemoth.   You need to get the add on peppercorn sauce, its home made and a perfect companion to your steak, unless you're an HP guy then to each their own. But you need to check if they have enough made cause so many people order steak here --- I've been saying the last 4 times I'm gonna try the burger here cause I hear its good... never happens gimme steak.  Sides I'd recommend the fries or my new favorite home fries (think of it like pan made hash browns vs fried hash browns) and get yourself a large plate of mushrooms to share amongst all of you.  They also have a tradition of giving you a plate of pre-buttered ... well pre-margarined bread, the bread tastes fresh and nothing special  - but it has that fluffy old style kind bread like its homemade, never asked.  One other thing if you still have space in your bottomless pit you might want to share a slice of their strawberry cheesecake amongst your guests cause I assume everyones full.     I'm NOT a dessert person (unless it comes to chocolate cake thats my kryptonite) but this was so effin good.     Guess what its homemade as well.  Its a good joint to eat lay back talk amongst your buddies and just chill out, they serve beer here too.  I would give the steak 4 STARS OUT OF 5, but since most care about decor I'm giving this place a 3.5 stars out of 5  STEAKS AMAZING, GOTTA EAT HERE ONCE --- you know how it is some might agree others might not.     Oh one more thing you get big flat steaks here, not those thick 1 or 2 inch steaks that most restaurants use to disguise their small size.  So if you like the charred outside thick steaks then this might not be your type of steak joint."}
{"text":"Crappy cafeteria-quality food, stale atmosphere and a completely inflexible menu (they refuse to substitute salad for fries as a side for my fish). They will give you pre-buttered Wonder Bread and your glass will still have water drops all over it, as if the dish-washers had simply dunk it under a tap before filling it up with whatever you ordered to drink. I was extremely hungry, and the food and atmosphere were so unappetizing that I simply could not eat my meal. Worst use of $40 ever."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the east end when it comes to breakfast: it's fast, cheap and always good.  If I had to pick one diner (which I consider The Tulip to be) - I'd say this one.  The staff (which has been the same for years now) is friendly and efficient.  I have heard many good things about their steak, haven't tried it yet myself though."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is poor, the food doesn't take too long but the server are not readily available when you need them.  It can use a make over as the decor is extremely dated.   I would expect I place like this to have cheaper prices as well."}
{"text":"Dont judge a book by its cover.  Great food+sketchy locale=fun time!   Tons of food for the money and tasty too!  Dont expect a wine list nor glass for your beer, but come hungry and happy and leave full and happier.  Love it!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Don't let looks deceive you, while the location of the Tulip draws a diverse crowd, the restaurant is clean, and service is friendly without judgment (we've witnessed very kind treatment of some seniors, and others who appear a bit down and out).  Essentially, this is a really good \"greasy\" spoon serving up home-style comfort foods and steaks.  We tend to stick with the daily specials, in particular: -  Mondays or Fridays for their Spaghetti night (a mountain of spaghetti, and their meat sauce is really good, with a small \"kick\" to add flavour) -  Thursday - always hard to decide between Breaded Pork Chops served with 2 huge scoops of mashed;  or a large serving of lasagne with salad on the side. -  Friday - Shepherd's pie (also Spaghetti night) Recently prices have gone up by $1 to $11.95 but you definitely get a lot of food, and the food is cooked well.  On occasion, we've tried their steaks, but (hopefully this doesn't sound snobby) we prefer some of the higher end steakhouses because the cuts are thicker and tailored more to our fondness of rare steaks.  But, the Tulip does offer a dinner special on various cuts of steaks (no rib-eye though), although the dessert choices with the special are limited to rice pudding and apple crumble, which were meh.  The fact is, if you have room for dessert, you should be ordering their very decadent chocolate cake, or one of their cream pies.  Anyway, this place is great value and tasty!  We were just here last Thursday, and as I've only recently started reviewing on Yelp, I wanted to be include a review of one of Toronto's \"institutions\"."}
{"text":"I've been debating wether I should give this place a 4* or 3*. I ended up going with a 3 but don't get me wrong I really like this place. This is a great place for comfort food and big portions.  If you're in the east end and can't decide on a breakfast place I'd say Tulip is one of your best options. The interior of the restaurant is like a diner and yeah might be old but like I said you're going for big portions and good food.  I do recommend this place to my friends and family and am not reluctant to bring anyone here. It's pretty quiet too which is nice while enjoying your meal."}
{"text":"When you want a really tasty, juicy steak for a really good price, this place is it.  From the outside, the place does not look as welcoming, and usually those that are on this stretch of Queen St. are usually there for The Burger's Priest (awesome burgers, by the way). You walk inside, and the atmosphere seems 'old'.  The staff are very polite and welcoming though.  You look at the menu, and they are just your typical diner meals.  I usually get the porterhouse steak, and sometimes the prime rib.  Steaks are cooked to perfection.  Juicy when you cut into them.  Perfectly seasoned.  They don't use peppercorns or any fancy seasoning, just salt and pepper, and it comes out perfect. They serve it with a slice of onion, which if you have nowhere special to go or a hot date, is a perfect combination.  I now always want to have steak with a slice of raw onion because of this experience."}
{"text":"The server almost made my wife crying over there tonight because of his rudeness.   Here is the story, today is my son's 100 days and my wife hasn't had rare steak for a long time since her pregancy. A friend recommened us Tulip, and we went there around 6 to have our steak dinner.   A mid age white male served us. We order 2 midium rare steak dinner (tenderloin and striploin) with house wine. I should say everything was ok and we were happy until the steak came up. My wife's steak was still pretty good and she let me try a slice, its well flavored and juicy. I gave her a slice of my striploin steak and after a couple of slices i realized that its over cooked almost cooked as a well-done. I had 1/3 of the steak and i can't push myself to finish a steak like this. i called the server and he said \"you almost finished half of the steak, you should cut you steak to check it when it was served onto your table!\" I was a little bit shocked by a server talks like this, because I used to be a server too and i could never talk to a customer like this. so i thought there must be some misunderstanding and i explained that if i cut it open it may turn cold faster,  the edge has fat and i didnt expect a midium rare can be that well done. He replied that he can get me a new steak but repeated what he told me earlier again by adding \"I'm telling you\", so it was like \"I can get you another steak but I'm telling you, you've already had almost half of your steak and you should cut...\". Now I can clearly see the judgement from him and I told him I dont want a new steak anymore just put my plate back onto my table. My wife dropped tears at that moment. We were there to spend mony to celebrate but it turned to be a  disappointed and depressed dinner. He took my steak out of the bill after all, but it doesnt change the fact that our 100 days celebration was ruined, we left without the dessert which comes with the dinner. Guess not in having a dessert mood."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot and it was much better years ago.  It was the place to go for home cooked meals.  The steaks are very good and my favorite there is the spaghetti with meat sauce.  Breakfast is also good.In my opinion its to die for.  Most of the other food has become hit and miss.  Location and decor are about a 2 star.  I really don't know what to say about the washroom.  Pretty gloomy."}
{"text":"As a greasy breakfast spot The Tulip is great as long as you save your dough and skip the coffee that tastes like it was strained through a sock (go to Voulez Vous just west).   There was 5 in our group, all ordering an egg dish. Most the two egg special with bacon or peameal on the side. I ordered the chopped steak (forgetting that is a classy way of saying burger). All was delicious. I ordered my old school hashbrowns (fresh chopped, grill fried potatoes not from a bag) well done and they were fantastic. All orders come with toast that they bring on a couple of plates. Plenty for everyone.   The staff were efficient, if not particularly friendly or engaging. A bonus was a breakfast for 5 came to a meagre $42.   The Tulip is not fancy and it doesn't pretend to be. Lower your expectations of decor and enjoy a quality cheap meal."}
{"text":"It would appear that the Tulip is my new weekend greasy spoon/family diner.  Since bringing offspring into the world, new consideration must be given to space requirements of a one year old and all his gear - The Tulip accommodates nicely.  Ambience - clean, diner style tables, 80's decor (I guess?) Service - I have only been on weekends when they are busy, the staff hustle, they refill coffee without asking.  All I can ask for. Food - I've had various breakfasts, eggs always perfectly cooked, sausage, bacon, peameal, all fine, pancake? Thick and fluffy.  The hash brown potatoes are perfect (I don't like deep fried potatoes for breakfast).  My wife has had a couple club sandwiches and gets gravy with her fries.  You get a big bowl of proper gravy that just happens to go very well on top those hash potatoes.  I did have steak and eggs once and found the steak, while cooked properly, to be a little tough.it was too much protein for me at 10:30 am but then again, I'm not a real man.  I'm looking forward to a lunch there someday soon to try something like a Hot Roast Beef sandwich.  They are not trying to do something new or exciting and for me I hope it stays that way."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!   Okay, the service was a little slow, but you just gotta settle in, read the newspaper, relax and enjoy yourself. There's nary a brunch line-up at this joint, but don't let that fool you. The quality is surprisingly good for an ol' timey diner. Now, I don't eat meat, so maybe I'm not the *best* person to review a steakhouse. But suffice it to say, I'm an expert on diners in Toronto and this one passed with flying colours:  Strong coffee (well, *diner* strong, that is) Well-cooked eggs Perfectly toasted toast (hey, that does NOT apply to all diners, amirite?!) Great homefries Romaine lettuce and high-quality feta in the greek salad Oh! And the wife said the bacon was great (again, really not a guarantee at all diners)  Do it! Don't let silly things like decor fool ya :)"}
{"text":"It baffles me to no end that this joint manages an average rating of 3/5 stars on Yelp. I can only charitably conclude that the place is riding on reputation from its glory days of yore. Those days are clearly over.  I ate here with my wife as we were passing looking for a decent place to eat. I ordered a burger with a Greek salad, my wife ordered the fish. If you fancy hospital cafeteria food served in a dirty setting, this is the place for you. My \"Greek Salad\" was basically a gigantic pile of lettuce sprinkled with cheap feta. My burger was tough and grey - I only felt safe eating it because it had clearly been cooked into lifeless shoe leather. The bread came pre-buttered (WTF?) and appeared to be wonderbread, or maybe the generic kind you can get at No Frills.  On the plus side, we didn't get sick after eating there. Won't be returning to tempt fate..."}
{"text":"It smelled when we got there... we should have taken that as a hint and left.  The waiter admitted that he heard that from many customers, and it was due to water damage from a few weeks ago.  And... it's not fixed yet???  We both got steak... and I nearly threw up when I tasted mine.  It had the texture of tofu.  Really gross.  I got the waiter to take it back.  He was young, but really not a nice guy.  Suggested that I don't know how to eat steak.  The waiter messed up much of our order... not bringing our drinks until we had our meal and had to remind him.  Not bringing vinegar even though we asked for it.  Not replacing my cutlery after taking my first meal away.  Ordered fish & chips and french onion soup instead.  The soup was really good.  The dessert was apple crumble and it was mushy.  Horrible.  When I first heard the name of the restaurant, I was hoping it would be a Dutch restaurant.  Not a single Dutch item on the menu.  Yet another disappointment."}
{"text":"The tulip the tulip. What am I supposed to say about you? my feelings are so mixed.   Let's start with the location. It's not in a wonderful neighborhood. There's an adult video store right across the street, classy view from the window, and great for families! The interior is all cheap retro nonsense, I like retro done right, but it just isn't. The bathrooms downstairs, are an experience all on their own, avoid it if possible.   The food. Avoid anything that isn't a steak. One of the worst burgers ever. The steak is alright, but at keg prices, you're better off at the keg. I mean, the steak is good, but the sides really aren't. The veg is embarrassing, the mashed potatoes seem almost instant.   The service was actually fine. Quick, attentive, food didn't take forever. I can't complain about the service.  Overall it's alright. Just make sure you're going for the steak."}
{"text":"Ignore those who trash talk the chocolate cake. It is one of the things that they are famous for and they have been making it for years, even when the ownership changes hands. It has at least 5 layers with chocolate buttercream and for $4.95 it's an incredible deal. It's a traditional, amazing chocolate layer cake and they always serve a slice large enough to be shared. At this point it will be the only reason I bother returning.  I've been going to the Tulip for 20 years and am so disappointed by their recent price increases (dinner menu). The food is just diner quality but for the price it used to be a great deal. This is no longer the case. Suddenly jacking everything up a few dollars per plate or item is ridiculous. The regular clientele of this diner are not wealthy people, it's a lower income neighbourhood. It used to be a big cop hang out for breakfast and lunch but I will be surprised if they continue to frequent this diner with the new prices. I'm not sure who they think is going to come and pay these prices especially with a smaller menu.   Today they made a random rule that when you get sandwiches as take out, you can't have coleslaw even though the menu states all sandwiches come with fries and coleslaw. Nope. That's a \"dine in\" garnish only?!?!?! Are you people for real? You crammed a dill pickle in the wrapper with a hot beef dip (hot dill pickle???), packaged au jus and fries, but you can't throw some coleslaw in a small container?   Today, a Thursday at 6pm the place was DEAD. 1 table of customers. Normally you'd be waiting in line on a Thursday night at 6pm. Yet another example of how downhill Toronto's restaurant culture is going. It's rare to find a decent place to eat with reasonable prices in this city. So long, Tulip. We had a good run. It will be interesting to see how much longer you last."}
{"text":"I usually go for breakfast here once in a while but it's Monday to Friday...We had a bit of a sleep over with friends due to late night karoke session that lasted into the wee hours and friends don't let friends drive home.,..  We arrived around 10:30am and lucked out with the last parking spot out front brilliant..  The order:  2 eggs w/sausage over easy/toast and potatoes, one eggs bene with ham and hollandaise on side, 2 poached eggs soft with ham and the other stuff.  One Tea, 3 waters.  $20 and change plus tip.  Service was efficient and not overy friendly but they got the job done.  All the food was perfectly cooked, not greasy and very tasty.    No complaints from our group.  I think having breakfast there on the weekend is the way to go.  Through the week it's hit and miss.  note: eggs bene is only on wknds and holidays.  Hollandiase had that perfect hint of lemon.  Will be back, only on wknd."}
{"text":"Long ago this place was one of the great remaining greasy spoons - great value, great comfort food - and as an added bonus was known for phenomenal steak and eggs.    Well it's clearly gone through some ownership changes in recent years (decades) and it is no longer what it once was.   The steak is tough, overly spiced and not cooked to perfection.  The service is good enough - an easy thing to do since it's nearly always empty.   After ignoring it for about 5 years I recently returned for a visit, was unimpressed but decided to give it two more chances just to be fair.  Sadly, it's just not worth it anymore.    There's just nothing redeeming about The Tulip.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Shows good value for money.  They have a very loyal clientele that manages to keep them in business after all these years.   I was definitely the stranger coming into the bar wearing a t-shirt and shorts having just finished jogging, but they served me without issue at the bar.  I had the steak, and it's definitely a bargain.  You get a salad, bread, your main with bread and veggies, and a choice of dessert, all for $21.  The menu and the décor could use some updating, but it's the old fashioned charm of the place I suppose.  Steak was chewy and not what I would expect from a steak house, but it certainly got my fill of protein for the day."}
{"text":"This used to be my Sunday night staple when I lived in the beaches. Having traveled the globe and tried many steaks I would have to put tulip at the top of the list. The service isn't the best but it is by far not terrible either; just average."}
{"text":"Monday morning.  9:30 I arrived to find my breakfast friends already there, having received their coffee and OJ. 9:40  Waitress took my order for coffee. 9:50 My coffee arrived 9:55  She took our breakfast order 10:10  Our breakfast arrived.  40 minutes to receive breakfast on a Monday morning at 9:30?  Ouch!  It WAS busy, but for most of the time there was only one server, who despite her dilemma, remained pleasant and friendly.  The food was ok, but no reason to rush back.  There are plenty of better breakfast places.  (One friend had the sirloin steak and eggs, it was cooked properly, and he enjoyed it.)"}
{"text":"This place is a local institution. Exceptional food at amazing prices! Don't trust some of these other negative reviews, this restaurant has been serving happy costumers since as long as I can remember. Without a doubt you must try one of their cuts of beef, but their spaghetti with meat sauce is also surprisingly good which you can order as a side. I always get sides of mushrooms and gravy to go along with my steak and it never disappoints. Come in for dinner but make sure you're hungry, because you will leave stuffed!"}
{"text":"Came here Sunday evening after a long day at the beach so having worked up a big appetite I was not sure what to expect.  Had a number of customers but not too busy and 6 of us were seated quickly.  The place itself is nothing fancy and is more of a casual diner and clean with friendly staff.  They had a special on so most of us ordered from that menu, $21.45 after tax included either a French or Italian style salad starter.  I chose Italian and it was very nice, the vinegar not too over powering. There was also a side of buttered bread which was not mentioned on the menu but we were not charged for it so it went well with the salad.   For mains I had the steak, medium rare. The steak was the highlight it was tasty, cooked perfect and had a unique coating and taste. I was not able to finish it as I also tried some of my friends lamb rack which was also on the specials. That was absolutely delicious!  The deserts for me were the let down area, choice of either rice pudding or apple crumble. Neither which I am a big fan of and I did not bother finishing my rice pudding.  The service throughout was great and it was a comfortable experience, the kind of no frills place I would enjoy on any day."}
{"text":"if you run out of pancake mix, you are obligated to substitute pancakes for french toast! plain toast is not even a substitution!!!!"}
{"text":"The worse customer service and lack of care in all aspects of customer relations. I really think this place is still riding on a past reputation. From what I understand, it has had its day, but those days seem to be over.  The place looks like it needs a good cleaning, including some of the staff.  I asked for a side of rye bread, which they do have and they said no. I offered to pay they said no, I asked  why and they said because we don't give sides of rye bread, I said I didn't ask for free, I'm willing to pay, they said no. I left and won't go back."}
{"text":"Have not been in a while so I figured a quick sandwich and fries should be good???  The service is horribly slow, and then you never see your server again until you literally wave him over for the umpteenth time just to get the bill, and yes we had empty cups and glasses throughout our little meal.  The food itself was nothing short of terrible, how simple to make a sandwich and yet so surprisingly just nasty.  As I had stated before I used to frequent the place but stopped going and now I will most likely never return as there are much better restaurants.  As a final thought, I feel as though my $40 dollars was poorly spent..."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Ordered the burger, it was dense and flavourless. Also got the chicken parm on a kaiser, tomato sauce and cheese was bland. Frozen fries was the only thing we ended up eating."}
{"text":"A neighbourhood haunt that will stave off hunger with some old school, diner style traditions.  Patrons come for the $16 to $25 steaks. They're not top quality but for the price-point it's quite good value! Simple burger or cheeseburgers are popular and the pork chops, veal parm and liver entrees are delish. With the entrees you can always forgo the fries / potatoes for a side of sghetti. Meat sauce is extra. I always love a side of sghetti! Brings me back to my childhood... They also run daily specials and you can get a basic salad, entree, and simple dessert for around $15.  If you like the family restaurant style food growing up in the 70s and 80s or are looking for a hard-working, no nonsense, open on most holidays kinda diner... Tulip will satisfy."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast ever!! I would normally give this place a 5 star rating, but today my husband and I went there and felt  very sick afterwards. Our Stomachs are sooo sore..   It wasn't the reg chef Tony that works there on the weekends. Some other guy! Anyways, I ordered my usual  eggs benedict and coffee. My husband ordered his usual the big breakfast substitute the pancakes for extra toast. It came really fast less then  8 mins.. usually takes a bit longer... When it arrived to our table it Def didn't look the same and Def was not Tony s cooking. We proceeded on to eat it. My hollandaise sauce  was soo dark yellow and clumping.. ewwwww. . The peameal bacon had a sour taste to it.. my Home fries  were cold. I couldn't even eat it. . My husband's asked to have his eggs over med. It came back over easy... His bacon was raw.... His peameal bacon had a sour taste.. His toast was burnt... The only reason  it's getting a 1 star rating now is for the SERVICE! ! Very friendly!! All I can say is that if Tony isn't working in the kitchen. DONT EAT THERE!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but it's going downhill.  Waited 30 minutes for a bacon sandwich at 9:30 on a weekday morning. Ironically, this was after being dissuaded from my original order - because they thought it might take too long! I wonder how long that one would have been? No coffee refills."}
{"text":"The Tulip is like a small-town American restaurant in the middle of the big city.  They bring bread before your meal, but instead of a whole-grain flaxseed and cracked-wheat roll, it's a 8\" high stack of buttered white texas toast.  Sliced diagonally, for class.    The steaks are cheap, for Toronto, and delicious.  I can't recall any individual vegetable I've eaten there, but I do remember ordering the fried onions and being presented with a plate holding nearly a pound of them, right off the grill.  Save some room for pie."}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite to eat with fellow Yelper Tony F. prior to the awesome WAYLA Yelp Elite Event.  It was not our original dinner location, but seeing as the Burger's Priest had no seating available and it wasn't exactly warm outside, we wandered down to the Tulip.    The Tulip is your typical greasy spoon diner.  It is quite spacious inside.  It was not extremely busy seeing as it was a Wednesday night.  We had originally wanted to order the White-Wine-Steamed Mussels and Calamari, but unfortunately had to sub the steamed mussels with escargots since they weren't available.  I also ordered a small Greek salad as I thought I should get some vegetables in my diet after a weekend of meat-eating in Montréal.  The bread that they serve comes pre-buttered, so if you are health conscious, you may want to ask for it on the side.  Two slabs of cold white bread... Nothing to Yelp about.  The calamari was nice and light, not oily nor greasy, to my delight.  I didn't care too much for the dipping sauce that came with though.  It was a tomato-based sauce.    The escargots were quite tasty, with mushrooms and breadcrumbs sprinkled on top.  It went nicely with the bread.  I am glad I didn't order an entrée-sized Greek salad, as I almost fell over when I saw the size of their small.  I asked for the vinaigrette on the side, and they brought me an entire rameskin-filled portion of it... Suffice it to say, I only took about 3 tablespoons, and the rest went to waste :(  Our bill came up to $27 including tax and tip.  It was pretty filling as I avoided most of the appetizers floating around at the Yelp event after.  My philosophy is \"don't eat unless you're hungry.\""}
{"text":"I got the regular burger that was surprisingly delicious. But halfway through our meal a HUGE bug (with like 50 legs) that was like a huge centipede was on the wall right beside me... I almost died... I feel so bad because I actually really liked this place but that just revolted me."}
{"text":"The Tulip steakhouse? I think not.  The Tulip looks more like a diner masquerading as a steakhouse. It wasn't dim enough. The wine list was laminated and the ketchup bottle..well, it had seen better days. Still, they claim to serve less expensive options for steak in the city. Frankly, I wasn't too impressed.  The steak options ranged from $17-30. Although it was debated that it was more meat for your money, the choices that were brought out left questions as to whether they understood their meat. Chris P's porterhouse looked more like a T-Bone. But others seemed fairly happy with their choices so it may just be the one.  I didn't order steak--I copped out at the Steak out. My downfall was my starving belly and looking at the menu. If I hadn't looked at the menu, I would not have seen the special of roasted sirloin of beef (pot roast really). It came drenched in gravy, which I love. It wasn't bad but it wasn't the greatest I've tried. It was average and it soothed my stomach.  The server was okay. He got the job done, but never asked if we wanted refills. He offered side dishes without really explaining them (a whole dish of onions?!).  The downsides: 1. the mashed potatoes. They came as two scoops on my plate. The taste was plain, as if they literally boiled a couple potatoes, mashed them and that was it. I like creamy, fluffy mashed potatoes and these were not it. Also, I noticed a couple potato chunks. I detest when they're not mashed completely and, if it wasn't for the gravy, they would've still been sitting on my plate. 2. The bathrooms. Shari and I ventured down the stairs and were hit with a smell of (as Shari put it) rotting pipes that they're trying to cover up. Sure enough, as we entered the women's washroom, they had hung air fresheners on the pipes underneath the sink. True steakhouse class right there!  Despite the average surroundings, I had a great time with everyone there. Great convos and hilarious jokes made for a great evening. Still, when I got home, I realized it was the awesome assortment of Yelpers that made it great and not necessarily the Tulip itself.  The Tulip is pretty decent in the way of diner food, but I've had better when it comes to steakhouse atmosphere, service and food. I would probably go back, but not for the steak.  Honorable mentions: spelling and grammar on the menu. What steakhouse would serve \"Famous Choclate Cake\" or \"Steamed Musselswith cream sauce\". Plus, the side options leave one to wonder, \"what would they bake or mash\" if the word potatoes is omitted?"}
{"text":"I've only been here for the breakfast, and it was exactly the grub I was looking for, a greasy, no excuses traditional breakfast. Had their Big Breakfast, which was huge. Honestly, nothing that special, but really hit the spot. The pancakes were a tad dry and the toast was over buttered. But everything else was good.  It loses a star because the service wasn't the greatest. I think because of the depth of the dining room, it takes the staff a while to get to all the tables."}
{"text":"Came here again for another dinner with the family. Service was attentive...didn't need to ask for a water refill.  Though my fish and chips was just so-so... my daughter had the prime rib and it was really good. The desert that was included was apple crumble and it wasn't good. . Baked apples with brown sugar,  cinnamon and oatmeal sprinkled on top. They would have impressed me more if they put some effort into that.   My wife had the lamb and was ok. ..a bit too salty but again...we were fed, we left happy so 4 stars."}
{"text":"Ate here a few times, once recently.   The steak is always cooked the way you asked, and it is very juicy. Besides the steak, everything else is mediocre. The service was fine, the side veggies are alright, the free bread with margarine is pretty bad, and the house salad is meh (only 2 choices for dressing too.) The atmosphere isn't the best, spacious booths, but everything else can be a turn off if you are having a date. I would only come here if I happen to be around the neighbourhood for whatever reason, is craving steak, and have some extra cash to spend."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning, not that impressed by quality and services. Bacon was way overdone. I order the bacon and eggs, told them no toast or potatoes which was included. I ask for a couple of slices of tomatoes instead and waitress said no can only replace with cold slaw. Who eats cold slaw at breakfast. I would have even paid extra. Oh and you have to spent 25.00 before they will let you us debit or credit card. So if your one person you need to bring cash or it will be a costly order. In the old days a great restaurant. Now not so much."}
{"text":"i recently had the difficult occasion to talk to the owner face to face.  why won't she substitute 3-4 slices of tomato for potatoes and toast? and will only substitute cole slaw?  here's the explanation: 50 lbs potatoes are $17. case of tomatoes $50. nothing to add about the toast.....  how come not another restaurant has ever denied the trade? i haven't a clue but trust me this is a money losing strategy that costs her more than she realizes.  i don't order pricey items anymore like the garlic shrimp - 6 teeny shrimp in cheese for $11 or the ribs at $26 an order. i stick to the specials or breakfast for dinner.   my wife asked me to pick up take out there - nope i told her. pick somewhere else.  i also took some pics of normal, hospitable places that gladly substitute some tomato. and places not a kilometre away from the tulip and all who have been around for 30-40 years too.  the tulip is one of the most over rated places in east toronto and certainly their attitude to customer satisfaction is well below average. a regular low maintenance customer eating there 25 or so times a year for over 10 years [i even had them do a small catering job a few years back] and they begrudge me a few slices of tomato in place of toast and potatoes.  cray cray as my kids say."}
{"text":"Sufficient, but not fantastic.  I'd give this 2.75 stars and I am rounding up because I feel extra generous today.  +++PROS+++ 1. Can't complain when there's a table full of fun Yelpers to dine with 2. Portions are lardy. 3. Prices are reasonable (i.e. $6.25 burger with fries on AAA beef) 4. They were able to take a reservation 28 minutes before we came in.  ---CONS--- 1. They were able to take a reservation 28 minutes before we came in. 2. Apparently they have valet parking right in front of the restaurant!  The cost is $40 and it's run by the City of Toronto.  Gotta love $70 dinners at a dive diner! 3. There was this really loud Asian guy there last night.  Dude was super loud, rude, and his jokes were racist.  I can't remember what the joke was, but something about commonalities between Hitler and Terry Fox. 4. Food is meh. 5. Steakhouse?  I haven't seen such poor interior design and color choice since Chino Locos.  The atmosphere is blah and you're better off making a steak at home and eating it alone.  Overall, not great for dinner, but probably worth a go for brunch/lunch.  It seems more suited to that crowd."}
{"text":"Excellent tasting tender steak.  It was cooked perfect (medium rare) and nicely seasoned.   Service was excellent too.  It's a nice comfortable atmosphere in the restaurant unlike the stuffy snooty presence at the downtown steakhouses.   I would recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"Used to kind of like this place but not anymore. Fell for their menu item called 'Chopped Steak', was expecting slices of steak but in reality it was ground beef.  Lots of flies everywhere making the place look dirty. Last straw was seeing the owner barking at one of the staff members (that was working hard and always did when we visited) being lazy in front of customers - while repeatedly doing nothing but sitting on her ass and checking her phone herself.  Simply can not support a business like this despite some of the food being 'good value'."}
{"text":"Our table had the roast lamb special, the prime rib, and the 10 ounce New York strip-loin. Roast lamb was perfectly tender. Tulip's prime rib was marbled deliciously. The strip-loin was an awesome medium-rare with a crispy exterior. Portions are absolutely fabulous - we all really struggled to finish the entrees. Go elsewhere for dessert: their apple crumble and the chocolate cake aren't worth your time.  Service was good on our visit; really no complaints. Food and water arrived promptly; food was 10-15 minutes wait time from ordering. That being said, stick to the entrees, skip dessert, and leave your pretentiousness aside. We're not here for the decor or the perfect service, it's a diner. I'd definitely come back if I'm around the east side of town!"}
{"text":"been here multiple times, whatever I order is always good and the portions are huge and fairly priced. the decor is old-school and half the waitstaff look like they're still in high school the last time it was there but can't really complain about the food"}
{"text":"Price is good. Food is great. Their steak is comparable to high end restaurants. The decor is not good. Outdated and such. Not a place you would bring a date to. Family restaurant atmosphere. Change it up and you get 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Absolute go to for diner type breakfast. Fast service. Haven't been for dinner yet. We go here almost every weekend. Sometimes twice in a week."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Cheap food, good service and a very good menu selection.  Breakfast is served any time of the day and it's always perfect.  I love the side of mushrooms, always perfectly done. Large portions at great prices.  Afterwards, you can roll yourself to the beach to work it off."}
{"text":"It looks like a typical Mom and Pop and they do have some awesome homemade foods and specials, but what blows me away is the steak! Amazing cuts, juicy and tender! Way better than many steak specialty places."}
{"text":"The food is always good, hot , fast and inexpensive. Yes the staff are not 5 star but this is not a 5 star dinning establishment."}
{"text":"The Tulip is your typical greasy spoon... But The Tulip steakhouse? I am not so sure...  It seems we always end up here late at night when we have not found anywhere else to go, that's a good thing about this place it always seems to be open.  The server was okay, but it seemed you had to pest him for refills and he was just standing there the whole time and I believe we were the only table...  The weird thing about this place is having the bread already buttered for you, but that works to their benefit because they can just grab it and bring it to your table and also saves them butter... you never know where that bread has been......  I wouldn't order the turkey dinner as it tastes like an old shoe, I dislike turkey rolls ever so much, I need REAL Turkey!  How about the mashed potatoes. They came as two scoops beside the icky turkey on my plate. They had no taste and the gravy was disappointing as I despise BEEF GRAVY WITH MY TURKEY!! If you serve turkey as an everyday item you should have turkey gravy as well. Now back to the mashed potatoes, I like creamy, fluffy mashed potatoes and these were not them by any means. They looked so sad, but there was no helping them, poor little potatoes..   Again, this is just your typical diner; not a classy steakhouse."}
{"text":"i have mixed opinions over this place. while they cook a really really mean steak (better than many fancy steakhouses), their service is the pits and everything on your plate other than your steak is an afterthought. a thick slice of raw onion and a plastic looking tomato slice? throw me a fricken bone!  good for steak, nothing else"}
{"text":"Website menu prices & descriptions out of date. Big breakfast scrambled eggs over cooked, pancakes arrived at end of meal and under cooked, thick and lead heavy. No jams on table. Indifferent slow service. Slow to refill coffee, had to keep asking. When asked for jams for toast, was handed 2 strawberry jams... a selection given on a plate would have been better. Best to give this place a miss, there are others with similar menus with much better service. No point to return here again."}
{"text":"we went there today at 1:00 pm let me tell you it was awful!!!!!  the waiter we had was totally rude and a total idiot he was rude and in my opinion awful!!! Ii will never ever go back!!! We would of spent alot of money but never ever again will i go there But  having worked in the hospitality industry for 20 years and never ever been treated so bad!!! do yourself a favor dont go there!!!!"}
{"text":"Average greasy spoon diner, definitely not in the Steakhouse category as it is listed.  Service was sub-par. Was seating right away upon arriving with menus then waiting over twenty minutes for a waitress to come by with water & ask us what we wanted to drink. By then we knew what we wanted so we just simply placed our order.  Food arrived very quickly; 5-6 minutes from time of ordering. Quality of food was typical diner. My tomato & feta omelette was exactly what the name entailed & nothing more; flavour was quite bland & you could taste the added salt on top of the already salty feta cheese. Big breakfast special was large in size, yet everything tasted as if they had taken a salt shaker to it before bringing it out.   Once we were finished, we waiting another twenty minutes before someone came by to grab our plates & we asked for the bill. Fifteen minutes passed & we had no bill, yet every time we tried to wave someone down, they just walked past. You can tell that it is family run as most of the staff were just leaning around the kitchen & back room which you can see from our table & were talking between themselves. We overheard other customers talking about how they had been here for longer than we have & no one had even come by their table as of yet. Eventually got our bill, paid, & left.  Prices were mediocre: 27$ for a big breakfast special, an omelette, & 2 coffees.  Would not go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"Whatever you're imagining you're right. It's ok, it's a lot of food for the money.   The Thanksgiving Monday Dinner is one of the most depressing experiences available. Try it, you won't be disappointed - but make sure you have Thanksgiving dinner with your family the day before. If you don't, it really will be depressing, not entertaining/depressing for others."}
{"text":"One of the best old-school diners in the city. Atmosphere is very casual and in need of a bit of a refresh, but this adds to its character and charm. The food is absolutely fabulous and the prices are great. Last night we went for dinner and our server was attentive, but casual - the perfect compliment to the surroundings. Food quality is terrific - Best liver and onions we've had, the sirloin steak was awesome and the corned beef was delicious. Appetizers were great too - french onion soup and escargot.  Definitely recommend a trip to The Tulip - next time we're going on a Tuesday for their cabbage rolls :)"}
{"text":"The food is reasonable.  The cost is very low.  Service was very good.  They do somewhat encourage a fast turnoverso don't show up expecting a quiet date night.  Steak was incredible for the price. The waiter was funny and efficient.  Portions are HUGE."}
{"text":"Bad service and very hard to find the waiter. The steak is over cooked but good portion. Seafood pasta is very bad.  Taste like some high school student learning cooking.  Very disappointed. The apple crumble looks like someone got sick....."}
{"text":"The T is legendary. Service amongst the most responsive and thoughtful in The Big Smoke. I have enjoyed every morsel."}
{"text":"Just got back from the tulip and we were pleasantly surprised with the dinner menu.  I ordered the Diner special - small sirloin for 18.95!  Great price for a good steak dinner - it was 12oz btw.  We'll definitely be back for a great family style meal.  Service was also very quick:)"}
{"text":"Had steaks in many great places but when it comes to Toronto the Tulip knows how to do steak and the meat is fantastic. Cooked to perfection as ordered. My favourites are the Porterhouse and a 12oz Tenderloin. Often ask what is available in the mid am and enjoy it immensely. Service is super."}
{"text":"Earlier today I visited The Tulip with my family, as I've done many times before going back several years.  We've always gone there around noon (I/we haven't been there for dinner yet) and I've always ordered a typical breakfast choice of scrambled eggs, sausages and home fries and as with their other breakfast choices, the same comes with toast.  Today I decided to order something different for a change and settled on their toasted western sandwich.  It came with a side of coleslaw and both the sandwich and side dish were quite good, and fairly filling overall.  The service has always been quite prompt even though sometimes the restaurant is quite packed and although it appears their prices have gone up fairly recently, at $5.50 I felt my lunch choice was quite reasonably priced.  Apparently the restaurant has been a staple in the neighbourhood for a long time and it does have that simple, older style but well maintained decor throughout.  I would recommend The Tulip for a fairly simple breakfast, brunch or lunch at a decent price."}
{"text":"The food is good.  Moderately priced.  It not \"Keg\" prices, so it's a bit easy on the wallet.  Good location too.  Staff are a bit slow at getting drinks and stuff.    I usually order the 12oz Small Top Sirloin, on a Thursday, I decided to try out their breaded pork chops.  It wasn't that great.  The daily specials they have are hit and miss at times.  Just, don't get the specials."}
{"text":"Steak house and all day breakfast.  There is even a breakfast option that comes with a steak.  I would probably never eat steak here.  The good: - There was no line, but it was busy, and busy with locals (good sign) - Everything was dirt cheap for breakfast - The food came out really fast - There are signed photos of 'celebrities' on the wall including Silver Elvis and Mike Myers - The portions were MASSIVE for the money (there were about 6 slices of bacon with my bacon & eggs) - It was very efficient - Bill was brought and change returned promptly - Appealing graphic design for lunch and dinner special menus  The bad: - The locals were literally the locals from this corner which has a Coffee Time Theory index of 3 out of a possible 3.  Everyone in here was pretty trashy.   - The food was pretty mediocre  - My eggs were undercooked but I didn't really care - Their coffee is borderline terrible  Bottom line - this place was fast and cheap but I would never come here again."}
{"text":"Terrible service... 2 grumpy servers for the whole restaurant at breakfast and they refuse to let you have rye bread before 11 am even though there's mountains of it. Lame. Also pretty grungy."}
{"text":"The Tulip's big breakfast is exactly as described - it is BIG. Three eggs, bacon, pemeal bacon, sausages on a mound of potatoes and toast alongside 2 pancakes. Pretty good value ($13) for all that food. Would recommend if you're hungry and in need of some greasy breakfast food."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place on Saturday night.  My brother has been coming here for a while and has enjoyed the food.    It helps to know what to expect so reading the review in advance was great.  I am not sure why people made such a big deal about the ketchup bottle though.  It was fine (PC brand ketchup).    This place is basically a diner.  If you looking for fancy fare, you will be disappointed.  If you are interested in hearty good food at reasonable prices and huge portions, you will not be.  The service was sufficient, if not overly friendly.  The previous reviewers were right about the mashed potatoes - they are bland and you will need the gravy if you order them.    I had one of the specials - the Roasted Shoulder of Lamb (at $10.75 with vegetable (fresh steamed broccoli), choice of potato and tangy lamb sauce (which was delicious) it was a steal!  I shared my meal with four other adults at the table and still had more than enough.  The portion was huge and the lamb was tender and falling off of the bone.    My kids ordered the cheeseburgers.  I should have taken a picture of them.  They were huge and the kids really enjoyed them.  My 9 year old son ate 3/4 of it!  My 13 year old daughter could only finish 1/2 of it.    The steaks were very good.  Not the best that I have had but still good.  We ordered the beef tenderloin with the peppercorn sauce on the side.  The sauce was delicious.  The steak was a little overcooked for my taste but still very tender and tasty.    The slices of pie (at $3.50 a pop) were huge.  We tried the coconut cream, banana cream and lemon meringue and all were very good.  I would go with the lemon meringue next time.  The chocolate cake slice was huge - split it between two kids and still had to take a portion of it home.  It was also very good!  We will most definately be coming back to The Tulip, even though it was very far out of our way since we live north of the City."}
{"text":"Ok. Just simple breakfast at a cheap price.  One thing, make sure that a film production company hasn't ordered, because you will be waiting and waiting for a very long time {20-40 minutes}. The empty seat will be deceiving, but they will be going crazy making over 50 meals."}
{"text":"Disgusting washrooms so I'd guess the kitchen looks the same. Why can't restaurant owners care about the washrooms? Most are filthy."}
{"text":"I like places with character that attract characters.  The Tulip is one of these places, with character/s in spades.  I like it here.  The burgers are tasty (I haven't had the steak, but the number of passing plates suggests that it's a popular menu choice).  The Tulip represents the type of restaurant that I secretly love, in that the \"fresh\" sides are so surely frozen* that I can easily justify fries with everything.  FRIES!  WITH EVERYTHING!  MOAR FRIES!  *I don't even mean this disparagingly.  The hot veggie sides just look homestyleaverage, and the salad my friend dug into was large, but unremarkable.  Onto the freedom fries!  Burger with fries is my jam here: keep it simple, keep it meat-y.  That's the secret to success at The Tulip.  Pass it on.  Yelp note: settle into a booth, nom on some pre-buttered bread, and enjoy the local regulars.  Sunday afternoon has a lot of families, and I love the feel that I'm stepping into a neighbourhood place teeming with local regulars.  It's throw-back, in the best possible way."}
{"text":"I was lured to The Tulip because of BlogTO's claim that they had the best steak in town for cheap. I thought to myself, \"I'll order the all day breakfast and my friends can get the steak\" however, my breakfast request was declined. All day breakfast is only served till noon.  Let me repeat that: all day breakfast (this is literally etched into The Tulip's marquee) ends at 12pm. Isn't that just \"breakfast\" then?  Anydawdle, I had the salmon with veggies.   The salmon portion was big and the fish was decent - well prepared, but the portion was too big. Who can eat that much fish? Personally I liked the baked potato (my tablemates didn't), but it was a bit \"gummy\" instead of fluffy the way baked potatoes normally are. Like it had been prepared hours before.  The vegetables on my plate were inedible. They were the standard \"thawed and overboiled for an unspeakable length of time\" trio of cauliflower/carrots/broccoli. I had no desire to expend any calories putting my fork to them; they were absolute mush.  If I'm ever up before noon, I'll go back to check out their \"all day\" breakfast!"}
{"text":"As with my fellow yelpers, I came here with a dream of cheap steak. A simple dream that has inspired mankind for generations. In this regard, my search was stymied by the cold, harsh axe of reality.  The good: - Prices weren't exorbitant. Not cheap, but not awful - The steak was tasty - They serve HP sauce. If it's good enough for the Queen - and it does bear her seal - it's damned well good enough for you - The waiter was good. Not record breaking, but I didn't feel ignored.  The bad: - This is not a steakhouse. This is a family restaurant - Some of the menu is either no longer offered or redacted for those of us with a low security clearance. In the first case, it's really cheesy to block out parts of the menu with black ink, stickers or white out (our menus all had variations of the three) when photocopies cost a nickel. In the second case, I'm just scared. - Apart from the HP sauce, the condiments were a bit sketchy, most notably the ketchup bottle, which was held together with packing tape and most definitely not Heinz. Not. Cool. - \"All Day\" breakfast apparently uses either some definition of \"day\" or \"all\" that is entirely new to me, because they end that at noon. - The cauliflower tasted weird. Like, really weird.   The weird-but-fine: - Those who asked for onions or mushrooms, basically would up with an entire meal of such. Which is fine in that there's no chance they wouldn't have enough, but seems a bit of a waste.  The upshot: If I was in the area again, I could be convinced to come back."}
{"text":"I love hole-in-the-walls. And that's what The Tulip is - a true hole-in-the-wall.  Comfort food. Check  Reasonable prices. Check.  Outdated decor. Check.  Diner-style booths and stools at the counter. Check.  You know the place must be good when you get there at dinner time and it's full. (The place is not exactly in a cool/hip part of town.)  I ordered the Thursday nite dinner special - breaded pork chops. Two chops with two scoops of mashed potatoes and everything slathered with meat gravy. OMG it's so good!! I was full so I ordered dessert to go - a big slice of their chocolate cake (which I'm told they make daily.) I ended up pairing it with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream when I got home - yum!  I'm gonna guess that his place isn't for everyone. The hipster crowd might find it a little \"low-brow.\" But that's OK - more breaded pork chops and mashed potatoes for me! :-D"}
{"text":"What a great place for date night!   Huge portions, courteous staff and enough room ti spread out a bit.  The steak was awesome, as was the French onion soup.  (Definitely have the soup!)  We have leftovers for lunch tomorrow too.    And bonus...free street parking after 6pm.  We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"OK - so appearances aren't always everything. From the outside, The Tulip looks like a pretty sketchy restaurant and the neighborhood doesn't do much to convince you otherwide (with a seedy XXX video store across the street).   A friend had recently dined at the Tulip and recommended it to us. A day or two later, we received another recommendation to check it out.  We thought - what the heck, lets see what the Tulip has to offer. Taking the recommendation that the steaks here are good, that's what I had. And it didn't disappoint. The mash potatoes on the other hand were pretty terrible and I the veggies were frozen and a little soggy by the time my plate reached the table.   The service was great! The staff was super friendly and our dinner was severed quick.   I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"For the prices you're paying for, you do get a good deal. That being said, I don't think the food quality is all that.   I was introduced to this place by a friend as well as BlogTO! I'm a huge fan of diners and steak and breakfasts. Their menu is great in terms of diner choices and I love the options for steak, but it's basically quantity over quality in this case.  The New York striploin I got was cooked way too thoroughly and a bit tough. The sides weren't that appetizing and for $10 more, I probably could've gone to the Keg and gotten a better cut of meat.   The big breakfast was gigantic and probably counted at least 2,000 calories. If you're bulking, this is the place to go!  The ambiance was nice, but because of construction outside when I went, it was really empty. A nice place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"One of our regular spots for a lazy all day breakfast. huge plates full of good stuff."}
