{"text":"Got a slice of red velvet strawberry shortcake and another slice from a different cake for take out... their price jacked up and I thought okay that's fine..their cakes are pretty good.. only to find that when I opened the box, the strawberry cake was so tiny it could be eaten in three bites...  Worse yet is finding a small bug crawling inside the leaf of the cardboard box....  Overall: 2 small cuts of cake for 10 dollars and a live bug. I used to come here often and like the quality of their desserts. Very dissapointed and I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Very poor service on a busy Sunday afternoon.   Our waiter did not write down our selections and tried to keep it all in his mind. (9 people). He mixed up our orders and forgot one dish. He came back and said I have 3 dish 'a'. 2 dish 'b' etc. But as we didn't know what each other ordered, We had to talk amonsgt ourselves to find what he missed.   A problem that could have been solved if he just wrote down our orders!!  All our meals came with a choce of soup. A choice that was denied to us. He just came out and brought some soups until someone from our group said 'so we don't get a choice?'. Only then did he say 'oh ya, you can also have the borsht if you want.'  The cream of asparagus soup was a bit thick and clearly sat out and was reheated (thick soup skin).   Bread was cold too.     Fettuccine bolognese was good looking; slightly oversauced. but again bad service ensued when he just shoved a fork into my plate. No 'excuse me'. Not putting it to the side.   Another consequence of bad order taking is the wrong dishes were delivered to the wrong people.  Other mains are pork chop, beef brisket, florentine. All were average.  We had all finished and after a while we had to ask for our drinks. Another mark of poor service. No water refills at all.   Service 0/5 Value for money 3/5 Overall sarisfaction after meal 3/5"}
{"text":"Great meringue cakes, not a place id go eat with my family, but i dont go anywhere else for meringue"}
{"text":"Brought 2 cakes here early Sept.  (1) Black Forest  (2) Lemon Something  Both were nice, I remember it being better.."}
{"text":"We were there for dinner last night, Sandy, the owner's wife was very accommodating and welcoming.  5 of us ordered from the dinner specials menu.  They were all delicious and each dish was nicely presented.  The cream of broccoli soup was to die for and when it came to dessert time I wanted them all!  The price also includes coffee or tea, what a deal!! I enjoyed the decorations and it's atmosphere, reminded me a lot of fond memories of Hong Kong.  Wished I live closer!!! Veronica Berlin"}
{"text":"Their meringue is not as good as the other location. Other cakes are similar. Set meals are reasonable with price and consistent quality of food. However, if I have a choice, I would prefer the other location at Finch."}
{"text":"It is Sunday at noon and is Mother's Day.  When first stepped into the restaurant, it does not have too many people.  But not an hour later it is filled and packed.    The service is all you can say like a fast food restaurant.  The server expects you to know what to order if it is your turn.  Be quick and precise, not to hesitate.    The food though maintains its standard.  Each of the different dishes that our group has tried has a good comment.  The club sandwich is large and thick, enough to fill up any person together with fries.  The ox tail rice unexpectedly the ox tail is cut into very thick pieces so it looks piling up on the rice.  The ox tail is very well cooked and tender but the tip you can still taste a bit of the raw tail - can be done better.  The chicken comes with a salad and rice and the portion is large.  The Borsch is tasty and a bit too much tomato paste.  Most of the sauces are really thick and can fill your stomach really fast.  The lunch serving is very slow, may be due to the number of customers."}
{"text":"First Time: Very tastey and clean. Yeah. Finally. Mango cake was good...Second time was a little disappointing. Haven't been back since   -.-  -.-"}
{"text":"My family and I always come here for their cakes whenever it's a special occasion (birthday, Mother's day, Father's day etc.). The 8\" cake is $32 and the 6\" is around $22-$24. They have a large selection of cakes ranging from Tiramisu, Cheesecakes, Meringues, Fruit Cakes to Strawberry Shortcakes! Usually we get their green tea or New York Cheesecakes, and you can never go wrong with them, the Cheesecakes are always delicious and never too heavy.  On our latest visit to this location, my family really wanted to the 8\" mango meringue cake but unfortunately we didn't pre order it, so the one on display had been served to customers by the piece. Thankfully, there was also a strawberry meringue that was being served by the piece too and the owner was nice enough to combine what was left of the two into one whole cake! The meringue was amazing, I don't think there's anywhere else where you can get a meringue of this quality, it was nice and fluffy as well as very flavourful. This is a great cake place!"}
{"text":"Thanks for saving the day Maxims! My wife's favorite cake was discontinued & deemed a seasonal cake from my usual spot in Scarborough AND La Roca. Without calling & ordering ahead, I was able to walk in & pick from an assortment of ready made cakes & found a 10\" strawberry merengue for way cheaper. Needless to say, I solidified my super hero status on my wife's birthday & I'll be dropping in tomorrow, just because it's a Tuesday. I'd recommend this spot to friends & family for any occasion, thanks again."}
{"text":"This is strictly the review of their online order advertised on their website.  I ordered a cake on Sept 22 for the 8\" strawberry meringue cake for pick up on Sept 27.  Ideally, I would like another email to confirm my order is ready for pick up other than the acknowledgement that my order was placed. Anyways, when I arrived on the 27 to get the cake, none of the staff there knew about it. I had to show them my order ( btw that was already paid by cc from their online order system). And they had to scramble for 5 minutes to ask other staff if they had my order.  One of them finally called the owner I guess to confirm that my order was placed.  Luckily, they had the cake available for me to pick up but that's only because they made a bunch to sell for their display case. If I had come later during the day I'm sure they wouldn't have the cake I wanted available.  Not only that,i had indicated on my order to write\"happy birthday\" on the cake the staff said because of the cake I ordered, they couldn't write it on the cake and had to charge me an extra 50 cents to write it on a piece of chocolate.  ***Guess what, look at Nathan's Aug 19 2016 review, the cake he ordered they were able to write on the cake***  Our family has been coming here for the past 15 years on special occasions and this experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  Definitely wont be coming back after this!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much an upscale westernized HK cafe but I didn't really get that feel upon arrival. Their table settings were poor as they used paper to cover the cloth underneath. Service was poor as no one guided us to our table; they pointed their finger to the direction for us to be seated. They spoke too fast and most \"high end\" place usually speaks much slower. We had to wave someone down to take our order 15 minutes later.  There were limited options in terms of their dinner menu and one may argue that they're getting a value meal but I don't feel that that's the case. For $20 something, you get a soup, slice of cake, and coffee/tea with your meal. They also gave us complimentary loaf of bread. To begin with, all that were mentioned doesn't even cost much. Taste of food was mediocre. The best part of the meal for me was dessert; not to mentioned, they didn't have a menu so you have to walk up to their dessert display to pick your cake. I had the strawberry meringue cake and I really enjoyed it as it was light, crispy, and wasn't overly sweet. I would highly recommend to try their meringue cakes if you decide to give this place a go.   BEWARE!!! They automatically add 12% gratuity on top of your bill which they mentioned on the bottom of their menu prior to ordering. I didn't appreciated that as I don't understand what kinda service I received that they deserve that amount of tip plus my party was only 3 people. If you have a party of over 6 or 8 then I understand that auto gratuity may be required.   All in all, just did not have a pleasant experience. I will come back for the cakes but I wouldn't come back to have food again."}
{"text":"I was in the plaza here because of Bruno's and me and my bf were hungry afterwards.  The options, it appeared, were either a Japanese restaurant which the counter attendant at Bruno's said was not too bad, or Maxim. Well, we searched trusty Yelp and Maxim's was described as a Cafe serving French food. That was exactly what I was craving for and so we went in.  The lady asked me, in Cantonese, how many people and I was taken aback for a quick moment. I then realized this could be the same Maxims near my home...great for cakes, but so-so on everything else.  Service is awful here, in that it is very slow. They also do forget things. We came here Saturday around 3-ish so it wasn't prime time exactly. The food on the other hand was okay. I had the chicken which was covered in a great gravy, served with crunchy green beans (just the way I like them). My bf had the fish and chips which tasted like the best microwave oven fish ever! Crispy and crunchy on the outside, and fluffy white fish meat on the inside. The fries were yummy too!  Of course, we had the cakes for dessert and my fave is the Strawberry Meringue and Strawberry Shortcake:)  Overall though, I wouldn't recommend this place if you're hungry or if you're in a rush. The good thing is if you just want to be left alone and not have server's coming to see if your cup is empty or if you want more food, then this is your place.  They do serve alcohol (white and red wine) although there is no menu for it. Also, my bf originally wanted the kids menu fish and chips portion as he wasn't hungry, but they wouldn't accommodate which meant we got the regular serving (2 HUGE pieces of fried fish)."}
{"text":"* Food is average and well presented * Cakes are really delicious * Place is neatly decorated and looks clean * Average priced * Decent service and can get busy at times"}
{"text":"This place always seem to be empty when I go to pick up some cake.  I had dinner here once and it was okay.  It is more pricey than other Chinese restaurants.  I usually just come here when I have a sweet tooth - They have a good selection of cakes.  I tried most of their cakes - Cheesecake, Mango cake, Chocolate Grand Marnier and Strawberry meringue are my favorite.  It is around $4.50 a slice of cake but the portion is not that big.  8\" meringue cake cost around $28 plus tax which is a little expensive."}
{"text":"Their signature fruit meringue cakes are good but save yourself the disappointment and don't get the tiramisu. Tiramisu is always my bday cake so I know a good one when I have it. I decided to try this place this year and I have to say even T&T's grocery store cakes are better than it."}
{"text":"I was told that the place was of Western style cuisine, so don't expect the place to give you the typical asian dishes you find in Chinese restaurants. I came on a Saturday afternoon with my partner and the place was not extremely packed. We were taken to our tables and the waiter was quite quick to get our order.   I ordered curry chicken with rice while my partner ordered the honey glazed pork chop. The curry tasted quite sweet, and not as curry-ish as I had expected. The chicken was alright when combined with the curry. The rice, however, was quite dry. Having it with curry didn't make it much better. As for my friend's pork chop - it tasted quite bland. It was served with cranberry sauce, which was not a good combination for my friends taste. His dish also came with steamed vegetables - which were basically frozen vegetables. They were also, quite bland. I think the only part I liked from his plate was the cranberry sauce. The portion was pretty large for both our dishes, but for the quality was a bit of a disappointment.   Here is the main reason why we came for a visit: Dessert! I was told from my friend (we are both avid dessert lovers) His favourite being the Mango Meringue Cake offered at Maxim. However, he did warn me the cakes are sometimes really good  and sometimes average (inconsistent quality). When we tried it, the meringue was quite delicious. However, there was so much cream and not that much mango bits. So, the proportion didn't fit quite well, so the experience wasn't anything special for me. They have other cakes though. I would give them a try again, if I ever visit Toronto again. But perhaps not for the meals."}
{"text":"Love their cakes! The lunch or afternoon tea is better than the dinner. They give hot water instead of ice water to customers and that is the part I like. If they can make better milk tea or coffees, I will give them five stars."}
{"text":"Didn't really know that Maxim was a thing here, as I've been to the one's in Hong Kong. Was pleasantly surprised with the food and the service.  Knew that Maxim did mostly desserts and cakes, but the dinner was pretty good. We ordered off the dinner special menu, so we got soup, coffee/tea, and a slice of cake with the meal. I had Curry Lamb Shank with Wild Rice, which was very good. Rice was quite nice with a pretty soft lamb. The Seafood Paella was okay as well.  Cakes were quite nice, but ended up really full, so didn't finish it. We had the Tiramisu, Meringue, and Orange Chocolate Cake.  Service was quite good, as they were very nice. Came by often to see if we needed anything, and quite friendly!"}
{"text":"Ive had their strawberry meringue cake here twice. I love its flavour and textures combined and love that its too sweet or hard. The price is decent and I go out of my way to get the cake because you cant get it anywhere else to my knowledge. Be careful if you are ordering any of the other cakes as many include rum inside as an ingredient."}
{"text":"5 stars for their famous mango meringue cake. It's heavenly! Truth be told: that's the only thing I buy here. Maybe one day I'll try something else... Maybe."}
{"text":"Good environment and service, great price for the food being served, free WiFi too. Pretty plating."}
{"text":"Tried their set dinner. It's a good value meal; with soup, entree, dessert and coffee/tea all around the mid $20s range.   I would want to come back for their weekday lunch deals at $14.95 which include appetizer, main course, a piece of cake, and coffee/tea. Weekends are $1 more.   Nice service, spacious, and clean. The best part is it's one of the rare Chinese run restaurants that are not noisy. :p"}
{"text":"This is a good bakery/restaurant/cafe.  They feature a wide variety of \"french style\" baked good and a pretty decent menu for dining. They bake a lot of cheese  cakes: lemon, NY, Mango, Mocha, Mixed Fruit, Green Tea, Chocolate Grand Marnier, and Strawberry.  The also have the standards: Saint Honore, Viennese Chocolate, Chestnut Cake (layered with imported chestnut puree), and a slew of differently flavoured meringue cakes.  This is the place to take your date or significant other for some deep soulful looks, as you contemplate the universe, or more prosaically, the next few hours to come. Just like Soma, (no sexism intended), it is more a 'chick's place' than a man's. I tried to propose there, it's that kind of place.  But if you have a sweet tooth give them a whirl. I am partial to the fruit flan and the hazelnut chocolate mousse."}
{"text":"I had a very good experience. The food was hot and served relatively quick despite it being very busy that day with only 2 servers. The food was tasty, and filling. The price is very very good. The meal came with a slice of cake of your choosing afterward, from their large selection of cakes. Very pleasant little bistro in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"$40 Cakes taste the same as $10 ones from Sunny supermarket. Terrible quality 0/5. Not fresh either"}

{"text":"2.9 stars Just shy of 3  This place is pricey for the portion Even though set dinner comes with cake and drink, service is average.  The food is average can get  the same tasting food for less elsewhere.  The seafood pasta was too sweet  didn't taste good.  The mixed meat grill was better but  nothing special for that price can to go to real Italian or western restaurant"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner after a long day of work and it was just the perfect ending to. the. day. Love it. :) :) MY LEG WAS KILLING ME BUT THATS OKAY. I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO CUSTOMERS ALL DAY BUT THATS OKAY. Hahah. Not. NOT OKAYYYY.   I didn't really enjoy my experience here. First off, the inside and overall decor is really meh. I feel like it wants to come across as a high end restaurant .. but it was very unsuccessful in that. The grim lighting doesn't help much at all either.   Second of all, the food was quite expensive....I decided to get the \"Seafood, Seafood, Linguini\" because I was craving pasta and seafood so might as well kill two birds with one stone (plus I read it was popular or something). It was the most bland pasta I have ever had. I had to keep on adding salt just to MAKE IT HAVE A BIT MORE TASTE, MORE FLAVAHHH. Also, a lot of the seafood was over cooked. Especially the fish (and oh boy they gave me so much of it too loveS it :)). The waiter asked if I wanted to upgrade and I said yeah sure, thinking it would just be an extra $2-4 more BUT NO. NONONONONO. A BIG FAT NO. It was $9?!?! I don't know man. Yea sure, it came with soup, tea/coffee, and a slice of cake.. but that's really too much for me to handle. Never again. The soup was decent though (which tbh makes up the majority of the one star rating). With the slice of cake that I had, it was eh. The actual cake part was quite dry so it's definitely not too fresh unfortunately. I think this applies to some of the other items my fam ordered as well. I love mashed potatoes (HMU WITH MASH MY PEOPLE) and so I gave it a whirl and yeah no. That shit be drier than the sahara desert bruh. Ain't down for that kinda dryass lifestyle. A restaurant that can't perfect mash is a restaurant I don't want to associate myself with anymore. GOODBYE ADIOS TILL NEXT TIME.  ps. my stomach felt uneasy after eating here"}
{"text":"I ordered the lamb chop and much to my delight I actually receive part of a rack of lamb. Succulent. Broccoli soup was delicious. Service was superb. Atmosphere is at the same time classy but with a family feel.   Don't miss the desserts. Can't be beat."}
{"text":"I love the meringue cake here! I've had it so many times! One of the best! So fluffy, light, and it melts in your mouth.   The tart was delicious too. The chestnut cake wasn't worth it. It cost $4.50 and it only had one layer of chestnut and the meringue topping wasn't fresh.   Definitely stick with the meringue tart and meringue cakes.   A tip - order it the day before because I wanted to buy a cake, but it was sold out."}
{"text":"Always purchased cakes from here but never went to the restaurant. Finally decided to give it a shot was not impressed. We were the only table in the place and ordered the calamari to start which was perfectly breaded all around kinda like the one you buy frozen. Had  no seasoning what so ever. The Ceasar salad was ok minus the bacon as traditional Ceasar is supposed to be. Also ordered the sole almondine which I don't think was actually Sole, chicken parmesan was ok. I find the tomato sauce they make is to sweet and not slow cooked. Fussili with shrimp and Fussili with veg was not the greatest. Same pasta just different ingredients. It looked like it had a little soy sauce added to it for flavour Food arrived all 3 minute's apart with the last dish arriving almost 10 minutedso definitely was not happy. Instead of the waiter checking on what's taking long he was to busy watching tv and checking his phone. The menu is to big for a small place and I'm sure they can never keep up. Please shrink the menu down as it's just all blah and get rid of the TV. Final though is tried the place, food is not the greatest and pretty sure I won't be back. Price of items seem high as some of the sides on the main item's don't go together. Sorry I wish I could honestly give you a better review but it is what it is. To much going on on your menu."}
{"text":"Great food ! It was well presented and a great deal for the price , I recommend it ! No complaints rlly , service was good and everyone was polite ."}
{"text":"For the cakes, 5 stars.  For the meals - not so much.   I ordered the roasted lamb and was disappointed that is was not seasoned enough. After two bites, I pushed away my meal and sampled my friend's orders. It takes a very dull meal to stop me from at least attempting to eat it.  From what I tasted, one out of the four orders was appetizing.  Now on to the cakes. The cakes were very good. I would almost wish this restaurant specialized in cakes and desserts. That or bring up the standard of the meal to that of the cakes."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once, but visit several times a year to pick up cakes for any occasion. One of Maxim's most popular cakes is definitely the meringue (mango/strawberry); they are quite pricey ($32 for an 8\") but are delicious...Two of crunchy meringue (with almonds) and fresh whipped cream in between.  They offer a wide variety of choices for cakes and have always been fresh (black forest, mango mousse, cheesecake/green tea cheesecake, white chocolate  cake, mango yogurt, mocha, many more!).  The one time I had lunch here it was very quiet. The lunch specials are more pricey than your normal westernized HK cafes (ie. Firefly) as they can be up to $13-20 for a combo...although it comes with soup, main, beverage and a slice of cake. The food itself isn't bad, but my main complaint is the pathetic size of the cake of choice... it is literally 1/2 of a normal slice..honestly I don't think it would hurt to give a full slice.. you'd win people like me over who have a sweet tooth :3.  Additionally, my other complaint would be that they charge $0.50 for a small chocolate badge if you want writing on certain cakes (i.e. the meringue). The service at the cake counter can be quite lacking although there are plenty of staff chilling behind the counter.  They accept credit card for transactions over $30."}
{"text":"Went in for a nice lunch with my mother and it was alright. So we got the lunch specials which was around 10 to 14 dollars. Each came with bread and soup.   The bread appeared to be home made and was extremely good. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The soup wasn't hot however, it was slightly warm.  The meal itself was alright. I got the black pepper chicken and the chicken was tender AF HOLLLLLY. IT WAS GOOD. came with a salad and 2 spring roles.   Hostess gave us free cake which was also amazing!  Would come again!"}
{"text":"Take caution: this is going to be a bad review. I will begin by noting the good. The cake was delicious, everything else was bad or average.   We came here for my birthday dinner as a party of 2. We ordered a Spanish rice with seafood and after much convincing, a lobster Thermidor with steak. Upon asking how well the steak should be cooked, I said \"MEDIUM\".   When our food arrives, the Spanish rice is good. Our lobster Thermidor was also good. Our steak was under and cooked to \"RARE\". Fine, that's not a big deal. So we ask the server to re-fire/send it back into the kitchen. So she does. It comes back and now it's \"MEDIUM WELL\" and the worst part is that it's charred and BURNT. Seriously, that's just sad and not to mention, bitter (literally and contextually).   Serving us steak that's burnt is insulting to not only the food but also to your customers. I told the server about the steak and she simply took the entire steak away and did not do anything to compensate for their mistake. I felt robbed of a meal and not to mention still starving.   Anyway, don't come here. Drive a bit further and visit the location at willowdale. So in conclusion, I just said goodbye to a $33 plate of food.   I WILL NOT BE RETURNING. You have lost yourself more than a customer."}
{"text":"Maxim is a fusion restaurant where Western foods is served with a Chinese twist.  Seating was spacious and there was no line when I went on Saturday night with my family. The parking lot isn't bad as well, although several other restaurants share the plaza.  Walking in you can see this huge display of cakes, which is honestly the most exciting part of the meal.  Ordering was simple as the menu was literally 10 items (or less). This was a minus for me as I feel like the options weren't diverse enough.  We were served by 3 different waiters which made it confusing but understandable as we were the only table in the right-sided area, while everybody else was seated in the main (left) side.    Food came out pretty quick. The bread was heated before it was served which was appreciated.  Nobody likes cold bread. The soup appetizer was okay.  I didn't really like the clam chowder as it was the easy, cheap kind to make.  The tomato soup was yummy and had the kick of heat I wanted.  I got the cod and scallop with rice.  The seafood itself was good but the rice was cold and had some hard pieces.  It felt like it was left over night and then served back to me :(  Everybody else enjoyed their meal pretty well.   My family also ordered the: - Lamb: this was a little too gamey, but the proportions were huge. - Mixed grill: a lot, a lot of food.  To me they actually all tasted the same as they drenched it in the gravy but still not bad. - Korean styled beef: lots of meat but too little rice.  The quality of the beef was good but I wished they filled the plate up instead of trying to make it look like the tiny French cuisine plates.  We got our drinks at the end which was a little strange for me.  Honey-lemon-iced tea is always a fave - just don't poke too hard at the lemon so everything turns bitter.  My mom loves their milk tea (lai cha).  The greatest part was the dessert: Their meringue is famous and we order it every time it's my mom's birthday.  The \"shell\" is crispy but so flavorful with this nutty flavor.  It is FILLED with cream and fruits (mangoes or strawberries).  I wish they kept their quality with how much fruit they put in.  It's diminished quite a lot over the years.  Final Thoughts: - First, yes I will definitely be back but maybe for only special occasions when I'm craving the cake. - Second, they are so unorganized.  My mom ordered a cake to go to go for my sister's birthday (for after the meal).  When I was up looking at the display a little later the servers were like: oh what happened to the cake? We needed a whole cake.  Turns out somebody else sliced a piece of our cake off to serve to another customer.  Thank god they still had a small cake. - Third, the waiters are a little short with service. Like: HERE, WHO GOT THIS? OK WHAT DO YOU WANT? Very Chinese style. But not rude."}
{"text":"I really like the food here.  It costs a bit more than other asian restaurants that offer similar higher end western food,  but the cakes at this place are awesome.  I usually like to pick up birthday cakes here because they are that good!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Seated over an hour and our food still wasn't there. The server made it seems like our fault for asking about our food. I guess it is a custom for customers to wait for food.   Some of us received our food and found that the food was different from what we ordered. The server just say they ran out and did not inform us before hand.    Also, the tip was calculated on the bill already and I honestly think the service wasn't worth the 15% paid!   A simple apology for the long wait would avoid the disappointment. No matter how good the food, bad service will always turn clients away!   Good for cake but never for food!"}
{"text":"Though run by Chinese, Maxim is not a Chinese style Western bistro.  It is an upscale casual bistro that happens to be run by Chinese.  And with this arrangement, Maxim offers exceptional value when compared to other casual fine dining establishments.    Upon entry, I noticed the dim lighting, the white clothed tables, the pleasant and tasteful decoration and, you can't miss it, a wide selection of cakes in a refrigerated display case.  We ordered from the set dinner menu a Pickled Pork Hock with Sauerkraut and Potato ($19) and a Maxim's Mixed Grills ($22). Both came with roll and butter, starter soup, a piece of cake of your choice and a hot beverage. The Pork Hock was well portioned.  It was the size of a baseball (see pic). The flavour was bold, though not as complicated as the authentic pork hock at The Muskets. The meat was very juicy. The flavour was unfortunately one dimensional, but the tenderness and the juiciness of the meat made up for it. The Mixed Grills had a mix of steak, pork, sausage, and lamp chops (see pic). My BF said they chops were all tender and flavourful, though maybe salty for some. The cut of the meat was good.  I eagerly awaited the dessert because the cakes looked so pretty in the refrigerated display case.  There were maybe 10 types to choose from.  Patrons were expected to choose by viewing the case and ordered it through a wait staff back at table.  My BF chose a slice of Cappuccino Meringue and I chose a slice of Blueberry Almond Meringue.  I must say the Cappuccino Meringue was the better of the two.    Is Maxim good? Yes, food tastes decent.  Is Maxim a good deal?  Oh 200% yes, if you order from the set menu.  The regular menu is rather pricey.  Is Maxim French?  I am not sure.  It tastes more continental to me.  The service was efficient and sufficient, yet definitely not refine by the standard of a casual fine dining restaurant.  Maxim is a solid choice if I feel like enjoying a Western meal in class but don't want to hurt my wallet too much."}
{"text":"I came here recently twice for a weekend lunch and dinner. Both times I was equally satisfied with the service and food. Water was filled without you having to ask and there were enough waiters to serve everyone.   I would classify Maxim as a more upscale HK style cafe because they have a lot of the dishes typically served in a regular HK style cafe. The two basic choices between cream and Russian borscht soup also makes me feel this way. There is plenty of variety on the menu like sandwiches, soups, salads, burgers, pasta, curry, rice, steak, lamb and, of course, cakes as they are a bakery. They have regular lunch combos if you want to be frugal, or you can spice things up with more expensive lunch or dinner specials with the choice of salad or lobster bisque as an appetizer and a slice of cake as dessert.   For lunch I ordered some smoked salmon with shrimp pasta which was one of the lunch specials of the day with Russian borscht soup. The free bread they give you with the soup is not good at all. Very tasteless and cold. The actual soup itself was pretty good and I preferred it over the cream soup I also tried. The portion of the pasta was about average and the sauce used was not very good. However, I was able to eat the food from what my party ordered because their portions were much bigger. I really liked their Caesar salad and mashed potatoes. The deluxe club sandwich was really big and unfortunately, it was a hassle to eat because bits of tuna kept falling out. The Black Forest cake they picked out for me to eat was not to my liking, but that's only because I prefer more sweet cakes.  For dinner I ordered lamb chop with lobster bisque. The soup was made in a HK style which meant the lobster flavour was much more mild than if you were to have it at a typical western restaurant. The lamb was good quality and there was minimal amount of salt, pepper and seasoning which is what I prefer because you get a more clearer taste of the lamb. Others might find it too devoid of seasoning. Maybe it was because the restaurant was almost closing and they had to get rid of their cakes, but they let me choose what type of cake I could have for dessert this time. During my previous lunch visit, I was told there would be an extra $2 charge if I wanted to pick the cake out myself. I chose the mango cheesecake which was not very sweet again, but I guess that ends up being healthier.  All in all, this place has existed for a very long time (25+ years?) for a good reason. You might have to wait for a table on weekends. I would recommend Maxim for lunch and dinner and not for the cakes."}
