{"text":"I had pizza and wings and it was excellent along with great prices we will be going back to sample more of that large menu"}
{"text":"Had a great veggie wrap with delicious and crispy sweet potato fries-it didn't look like much from the road but it exceeded my expectations..5 star! delicious food on menu for meat eaters, too!  Glad I checked out Yelp reviews before driving past!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after school for dinner. Had a chicken philly with sweet potato fries. Food was really good. Restaurant could use a good cleaning. Staff was very nice"}
{"text":"Everything is always great here (Wraps, Pastas, Pizza, Sandwiches) and FRESH!  But today I tried the fish sandwich and OMG, for $6.99 you get a huge and awesome tasting sandwich that can feed 3!  I know because I ate a 3rd for lunch.  Comes with a generous helping of fries too.  Definitely go out of your way to get it (or any of their food) - Great prices on all.  WTG Wrap Shack!"}
{"text":"Very close to Kirtland temple, very quick and very good wraps and salads. My kid had the pizza and it was really good (had a bite). The best prt is the price, which was fair. Would come back."}
{"text":"Food is always ok but a little pricey for what you are getting. Love that they have locals working there and I always try to support small businesses but service isn't the warmest."}
{"text":"Outstanding every time. Fresh and highest quality. Pizza is good but everything else is great  outstanding wings and salads. Count us in as regulars"}
{"text":"Best hand made pizza I have eaten in a long time.  This place has everything one could want in a varied lunch menu at very reasonable prices. Family owned and operated in the quiet village of Kirtland, it is worth going out of your way for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped here after viewing the Nativity Collection at the nearby Visitor's Center.  Very small inside but most others were getting to go so we got a table.  I had the Philly Cheese Baked Sub with fries and it was Deelicious!!  Excellent fries and the sandwich was very yummy!   Others in my group had Chicken Strips, Quesadilla and a Santa Cruz wrap.  Everyone thought it was really, really good and we all had leftovers to take home.  Prices were reasonable and the place was nice and clean.   We also got an order of Fried Dough which was super good to.  The icing that came with it was pure sugar but the dough was sweet and tasty without it.   I def recommend this to anyone in the area looking to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Employees were pleasant. Place was clean. Menu had a lot of nice options. I was pleased to see there were many vegetarian options. I choose the veg head and when I ate my sandwich it tasted like meat. They must not do a great job of changing gloves or keeping the ingredients separate. Vegetarian options are only viable if they aren't cross contaminated.   I was disappointed for this reason."}
{"text":"Had the Santa Cruz wrap. It was great. Staff was friendly, service was fast. Restaurant needs to be cleaned."}
{"text":"Great food. My favorites are any of the salads and the mushroom swiss burger. Friendly staff too!"}
