{"text":"Great rolls and Sashimi patter!!!!! Ordered a variety of rolls and I couldn't pick a favourite. Came with tons of salad and rice!"}
{"text":"Don't let the dive-y interior fool you. Happy Sushi offers larger portions of great food, friendly service and reasonable prices. So happy to have found them in the neighbourhood. I will become a regular!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they first opened and is definitely my favourite sushi in the neighbourhood! The tempura is always nice and crunchy and is not over battered, and the sushi is always fresh.

 I always order the Vegetable Bento Box and the quality is always to my expectation. I find when I try a new restaurant I am usually disappointed, the quality isn't as good as it is here.

The sushi is always nicely rolled and does not come apart like at Double Sushi.

Great sushi for the cheap price!"}
{"text":"I have been getting take out from here for many years. Last night was my first for some time and I was very disappointed. We picked at the time given and it may have been ready early which could explain the soggy tempura. The chicken teriyaki was very unappetizing looking until the sauce went on. I noticed that the helping of rice was much larger than before but it still didn't make up for the lesser quality of the rest of the dish."}
{"text":"Wanted to get take out tonight after work and since I work so close to Happy sushi decided to try it.  The staff was very friendly and took my order very quickly.  Ordered the tempura tofu, tempura veggies and the the vegetarian sushi combo. When I got home was impressed of how much food I got for $20! Everything was great (Only problem was my tempura wasn't hot anymore but that's cuz it takes me over an hour to get home lol).  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"NOT impressed by this place at all.  The food is on par but the service was very bad.  There were 5 adults and 1 child in our party. We ordered 5 dishes. They brought up 4 forcing us to share and finally, when we were all done they brought out the last dish.  There were also lots and lots of flies in the back near the washrooms.  Disgusting !!!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, the music is relaxing, the prices are reasonable, the restaurant is quaint and the service is excellent. Perfect date place."}
{"text":"Order from here at least once a month. It's very reasonably priced and for the price you get a lot of value. Don't know if they are Korean or Japanese owned but every time you walk through the door their is a loud greeting from the entire staff which may catch you off guard. It's certainly worth trying if you are in the area, we're very happy with everything they've served."}
{"text":"Joe D's review is considerably more exhaustive than mine will be... his ability to go into detail generally surpasses mine... as we both know.  I went with the girlfriend last week, and it is both a) incredibly convenient (90 second walk) and b) she's teaching me to love sushi.

It was pretty dead, but they've recently either been changed owners or have simply rebranded.  Either way, once Joe tried it, I felt confident that I wouldn't die from the food, so we took the epic 90 second walk.

Verdict: tasty, good sushi.  Not amazing, but the Danforth Roll (crab/eel/shrimp) was pretty damn tasty... I get the sense that some more exploration of the menu would yield interesting results."}
{"text":"Ate here in the past and it was OK, but the last time I ate here, my stomach did not feel happy. Possible food poisoning from the salmon rolls. Didn't taste good, and was skeptical at the time of eating it. I should have taken a clue when the owner was also serving and making the sushi.  Dishes pilled high in the hand wash station. The kitchen looked dirty. Avoid."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place a few times. The sushi is yummy and staff are very friendly. My only complaint is that the sushi always seems warm, not cool. Maybe that's just my own taste"}
{"text":"Good sushi, but they continue to rip me off. Every time I order the same exact order, it's a different price. This week takes the cake though, our usual 38.00 order came in at 44.00.  Sometimes you question it and they're like \"oh sorry ya\" and change it back to the right price, and sometimes they don't care. Not going back there, plenty of other places in this city that won't rip me off with made up prices on every order."}
{"text":"Good sushi place, The rolls are a bit expensive in my opinion but the size of the roll is acceptable. Overall not a bad sushi place at all."}
{"text":"Live nearby and have been a handful of times for one reason and one reason only...

The people in this neighbourhood who love their sushi REALLY want this place to work out.  But let's face it folks, this place is less than mediocre at best.  I agree with most of these reviews (good and bad), but in the end, what you should be doing is getting your lazy ass in your car or hopping on the subway to head somewhere else cause this place is simply NOT GOOD.  All I can do is keep crossing my fingers and hope that gentrification speeds up a little around here!"}
{"text":"Solid food, I've never been disappointed. I've had various maki, the dumpling ramen, chicken teriyaki bento box, tempura+tofu don lunch special... I'm always well satisfied. And its cheap. Given the fact that it's cheap, though, one ought to set their expectations accordingly. Even still, it exceeds mine. Service is courteous and unobtrusive. Dishes come out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"This is a \"Japanese\" place made by Chinese people. So I right away am not judging them on authenticity, as it wasn't. I had the chicken katsu curry on rice, which comes with miso soup and salad which is quite affordable. The problem is you get what you pay for which the chicken was the best part. What disappointed me was the curry was too runny. Also I've never had a curry before where the vegetables were not cooked into the curry. These veggies were clearly boiled or stickied (hard to tell after put on top of the curry and lightly mixed in to the curry) and the potatoes were clearly deep fried before. The rice was not Japanese rice which you don't have to be Japanese to add it, I would pay more for better preparation and ingredients.  And I wouldn't mind waiting longer for my food to cook if it means property cooking them. I make Japanese curry regularly and it's close in taste to the various places I've eaten at in Japan and good Japanese restaurants in Toronto and other countries. After I left I had a stomach ache and diarrhoea,  so I would say it was mild food poisoning. If the restaurant is reading this please look up a recipe for Japanese curry. It doesn't even need the huge volume of veggies that you put in it. Keep it simple: onions, potatoes, carrots and maybe one other veggie like zucchini or mushrooms (which I don't care for mushrooms) please no mini corn cobs and no broccoli as you don't throw in story or boiled veggies in a curry sauce. Plus if you have a broken hand dryer have some paper towels as a backup, and don't give people sticky spoons, that may have contributed to my diarrhoea."}
{"text":"I randomly came across this place walking in the neighbourhood today. I am happy that I came because it really did make me feel welcome and happy there. The server host guy was very attentive and welcoming during my stay. I would totally return to the neighbourhood and eat at Happy Sushi :)"}
{"text":"I was absolutely surprised by this place. I was aimlessly wandering the danforth on a day off and happened to see their lunch special sign. Woodbine and Dan isn't a place that usually crosses my mind for sushi. Bored and hungry, I went in anyway. The place looks like a hole-in-the-wall pub back home but I did notice even though it was ugly it was very clean. I couldn't clock a single stray grain of rice on the carpet. Stuff was about a dollar more than the budget sushi places downtown or in the annex which put me off for a second. I ordered a lunch special with california roll, spicy salmon roll, soup, and salad ($7.95) with a yam tempura roll on the side ($4.95) thinking the special would be too small. This was waaayyy too much food. The extra dollar apparently goes to mega-sizing your portions.

The soup and salad are both bigger than other places. The salad has cukes, tomatoes, and carrot. The miso soup is the super salty kind I love but some others might find over salted. The rice in the rolls was well seasoned. The rolls, despite the 6 pieces in the special pictures, were 8 huge pieces. California was on the tasty side of average. The spicy salmon had the most salmon I have ever seen anywhere in a salmon roll. It was a whole lot of fish. They also stuffed in avocado, spicy mayo tempura bits (the crispiest I've ever had in a roll), tobiko, and lettuce (wtf?). It was kind of like a kitchen-sink roll but it was great. The yam tempura roll was also on the tasty side of average. Tea was free and at the end of my meal I got half an orange and a fortune cookie (wtf?). The server was super nice and attentive while I was eating. She sucks at math and brought me a bill for $23 for the above (wtf?) but after I corrected her math she was very apologetic. This place is a solid 3.5 stars. Rounded up to four for being close to home. I'll go back when I'm too lazy to hit the Annex."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great to find such a good sushi locale so close to home.t"}
{"text":"Customers walk in to an enthusiastic \"HIIIIIIIIII\" from the entire staff and are shown out in the same fashion. Sometimes the customers join in! This is a quirky sushi restaurant with really friendly owners/staff. My husband and I go in here a lot. If there is ever a problem (we go in often enough that this is bound to happen) the team at Happy Sushi is quick to fix any problems. It's not unusual to get a free miso soup, tea or sample maki when they have something new. In my opinion, some of their highlights include a sweet potato tempura and avocado maki and mango maki. There are plenty of options and they are all well priced."}
{"text":"Just as the rating explanation says, \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" It's not \"downtown\" sushi, but it does just fine for a night in! We've done both pick-up and delivery.

Happy Sushi has the best prices for sushi delivery in my area - and that is often the deciding factor on busy/lazy nights. Food is delish, delivery usually takes between and hour and an hour and a half (which is the same as every other kind of delivery we get except sometimes big chain pizza).

You could think of it more as an \"Asian Fusion\" joint rather than strictly Japanese (i.e. the fortune cookies, curry category on the menu), but it does offer MANY more Japanese selections than any other specific Asian cuisine. 

Speaking of the menu selections, there are A TON. Huge menu. Lots for vegetarians, and lots for those who are NOT sushi fans (Teriyaki, Kara Age, Tempura, Donburi, Ramen, etc.). And YES they have all your sushi favourites, and a great selection of unique offerings.

The miso soup I mentioned in my last review must have been a fluke - we've ordered 3-4 more times since then and every time has been FAB.

My fave = yam tempura/avodaco roll. Mmmmmm...."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Great service, tasty food.  Veg options on the menu that they'll make vegan if you ask."}
{"text":"Danforth roll is yummy!

Sheena says the advocado salad is fanastic & I had the seaweed which was good. We also had sashimi & sushi rolls and all was good and bill was reasonable and staff really were happy & nice."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Happy Sushi for a few years. Not because their sushi is particularly good; it falls firmly in the mediocre category. But, the ingredients were always fresh, it was nearby, and it was cheap. The lack of any better options made Happy Sushi win by default. Until tonight. We ordered the Green Dragon Roll, Spicy Salmon Roll, Yam and Avocado Roll and some Chicken Katsu. We placed our order at 5:45. Our food arrived at 7:10, a full 1 hour and 25 minutes later. The delivery driver kept blaming the restaurant. And then -- get this -- he gave us the bill and pointed out where to write in his tip! Major balls, dude. I don't care if it was the kitchen's fault or your fault, you will not be receiving a tip for delivering food 1 h 25 min after we ordered it. You know what else Happy Sushi won't be receiving? Any further business from me!"}
{"text":"This place is an amazing gem in our neighbourhood.  Food is always top quality!  We ordered a variety of items, including veggie tempura, edamame, dragon roll , danforth roll, grilled squid and everything was crisp, and very tasty.  We have ordered delivery in the past and every time the quality was top notch. Service is fast, friendly and very personable.  The chef is actually a very funny guy. We highly  recommend this place for dine-in or delivery."}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect it given the location (my neighbourhood), but Happy Sushi is actually a pretty reasonable sushi/Japanese restaurant. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but its interior decoration is equal to any of the other standard-fare sushi places you can find in, say, the Annex.

Both my wife and I were quite happy with our food. My wife hasn't actually been to many Japanese restaurants, so I took some liberties and ordered us some appetizers: edamame and gyoza. Both were quite tasty. (As an aside, my wife is now a believer: we recently bought edamame and gyoza wrappers to make the dishes for ourselves!) I ordered chicken katsu udon, which was served in a way that seemed unusual to me, with the chicken katsu separate from the soup. Once I ate it this way, though, it's the only way I want to eat it - the chicken stays crunchy, since you put it into the soup only when you're going to eat it! My wife ordered the chicken don, which she enjoyed a lot. I also ordered a salmon roll because I wanted to sample their sushi (verdict: good times). (Aside: this is Entirely Too Much Food. We ate till we ouched, and had leftovers.)

The biggest downside to this place, from my point of view, is that all their sauces were much too sweet. The sauce they put on the chicken don, in particular, was more or less intolerable until you mixed it with the rice, and the sauce served with the katsu was equally sweet and gave the soup a strange taste. This might just be my taste, but I'll be trying to avoid the sauces in future.

In general, I was really happy with Happy Sushi, and I'll definitely be coming back.

(Something to note: Happy Sushi, unlike many of the other Japanese places in Toronto, doesn't also serve Korean food. (This is a funny thing to say! In Toronto, most Japanese restaurants are actually owned by Koreans, so as a rule you can usually go into a Japanese restaurant and order bulgogi or bibimbap alongside your Udon noodles and maki.) That being said, if you don't like sushi, there's plenty of non-rice, non-fish dishes offered, like teriyaki and tempura.)"}
{"text":"This is not your go-to sushi place. This is your home from work uber late, 'I happened to be walking past and I'm starving' sushi place.

I've ordered here twice, once in-restaurant and once a party tray for my fiance's birthday. Both times the sushi was just ... OK. You can taste something off about it - freshness? quality? - something. But it's OK and the price is decent. If it's Tuesday evening and you just *have* to have a rainbow roll, I say go for it.

Nifty note: I will mention how very sweet the waitress and chefs were to us on each occasion we've been there. All smiles, great service. Just a legitimate joy to be around. So they got that going for 'em."}
{"text":"I have visited Happy Sushi at  least 30 times- maybe more - primarly eat-in and also take-out. Happy Sushi is not the best sushi restaurant that I have visited, it probably mediocore overall, however, they offer very good value, good and fast service and very fresh fish and thus my 4 star rating. As well, the area is a relative void for restaurants, so this place is valued in our neighborhood. The ambience is relaxing, cozy and comfortable, service prompt and friendly. Recommended."}
{"text":"To start the food is somewhat on par with other sushi restaurants. I had very rubbery sashimi from here the other day. My wife had undercooked vegetarian sushi. Although I will say the staff are friendly, the restaurant itself is disgusting. You can smell the mold. It seems very damp in the restaurant. The decor hasn't been upgraded since the 80's. The restroom is also pretty gross. Head east to Double Sushi, they are great. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite sushi place at the moment for cheap good quality. Their lunch specials are delicious and an amazing value. Go here if you find yourself by Woodbine!

My favourite is the grilled salmon roll - incredibly rich flavour wise, high quality salmon, delicious!

Also from coast to coast, they probably make the best yakitori I have experienced."}
{"text":"Food is on par but service sucks :  we ordered 5 dishes and they brought out the 5th dish after we are already done.  There were lots of flies in the back near the washrooms - rather disgusting !"}
