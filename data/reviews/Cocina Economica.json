{"text":"The food was pretty tasty but what makes this a five star for me is that the staff were also very personalable. The stuffed pepper was oh so good. We got our food to go and had a picnic at the beach (forgot utensils but had napkins) and it was simply a really good experience."}
{"text":"Great little place.  We tried to go last week - but it was closed for a movie shoot and transformed into a flower shop! The owner was super apologetic and gave us flowers when he saw how disappointed we were. Had been wanting to try the place for awhile.   Went back last night for dinner and it was amazing. Perfect food for sharing - recommend the tacos al pastor and the ceviche with the Mexican coffee at the end of the meal. It's brewed with cinnamon and is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"The food is good, but little things like charging an extra $4 for a TINY side plate of extra beans and rice when we ordered two starters, two mains, drinks and dessert, is small-minded.  Having said that - we enjoyed our meal; the ingredients are fresh and the mains portions are generous."}
{"text":"Yum! I am already craving the Al Pastor again... Loved this little place.  Best guacamole I have ever had - so fresh tasting and the perfect amount for two to share. As someone who can't eat spicy food, I loved the salsas and did not find them hot at all. The Al Pastor was sooooo tender and juicy and such a generous portion for the price.  With two meals, an app, and two drinks (beer + juice) coming to only $55, this is a major win in my books!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Authentic Mexican food, in a cozy atmosphere. The food was fresh, I loved the guac (not garlicy at all) and the staff was quite friendly. The place is VERY small, so make reservations if you can. I would like to return in the summer months, and spend some time on the patio. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"AWESOME ceviche...! Amazing. I had the double leg chicken dinner and it was good but anti-climactic after such a fantastic appetizer."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food my boyfriend and I have ever had. The place was quite small and packed, but it was so worth it. We ordered the guac and queso with chips, and the molcajete. The molcajete comes in a stone pot, so your food is piping hot - which I absolutely loved. The flavours were amazing, and with 6 tortillas, there was more than enough food for the both of us.   The service was prompt, and our waiter went through the menu with us as it was our first time there. We will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"The food in this place is sooo good.  I went with two of my vegetarian friends and there were so many options for them to chose from. The service is  casual and friendly mostly due to te small size of the bar. Highly recommend it's def a hidden gem  Can't wait for the summer to sit on the patio"}
{"text":"Great food. Not the typical Mexican where you find only burritos and tacos, they have amazing dishes to share. Really good cocktails and service."}
{"text":"So this place is super packed and really hard to get a seat at even if you have a reservation (despite showing up earlier than our reservation time, we weren't seated until fifteen minutes past when we'd reserved for), and with good reason: the food is AMAZING.  Our waiter was friendly and enthusiastic about the food, explaining the items on the menu and encouraging us to try one of their signature drinks.  He even offered us a sample of the horchata, a sweet rice milk drink that set off the richness of the rest of our meals to perfection.  I had the pork (al pastor) plate, which came with a generous portion of rice and beans as well as fresh tortillas.  Our table also shared an order of guacamole, which was freshly made and very tasty.  The decor was great and the vibe was awesome--we ended up chatting with the couple seated beside us at the bar (mostly prompted by us wondering out loud, \"What did you order? That looks delicious\" and turning into a very enthusiastic recommendation of everything they'd been served).    I definitely want to go back--maybe once it warms up and the patio out front is open!"}
{"text":"The prices seem a bit high, but you get an awful lot for it.  Most things come with rice and beans on the side, and they give you chips and (delicious homemade) dips and hot sauces for free.  The dips are very large: the size of a guacamole that most places would charge you for. The portion itself is fairly generous.  They have all the most typical Mexican beers.  We stayed for a long time (maybe 3+ hours?) and our two separate waiters never made us feel anything but completely welcome.  They even lent us their USB charger!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot in the neighbourhood. It's small so reservations for a group are a must. They have a great little patio too. Food was very tasty, although the Pork Al Pastor with beans and rice could've used a bit more pork. I myself had the Pollo Rostizado (sp?) and it was very good flavour and size-wize.I only wish they had their delicious sauces in smaller or more linear dipping plates so that everything could fit more easily on the table. All in all, I would return. Great, fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"So so so good. The food was absolutely delicious. Loved all the salsas - especially the verde. We ordered the lamb barbacoa and the carnitas - both were extremely tender, extremely flavourful and extremely delicious. The tres leches is a must!  The service was also very very good!  We will definitely be back. I can't believe I didn't discover this gem sooner."}
{"text":"Great food. No point ordering Margarita pitchers as they are more expensive and less value than ordering individual Margaritas. For example as pitcher is $45 and an individual drink is $8. The pitcher doesn't even give 5 drinks, which means you're paying $45 for less than $40 value. Pitchers should offer a bulk order discount, here it charges you more. :?"}
{"text":"This place is cozy, the food is great and the people that work here are amazing!   We walked up to get seats and they were almost all booked for reservations so we took some of the last seats at the bar.   We tried the Caritas as recommended and the Res en Salsa Verde and both were delicious!  Now that I've finally tried this I'll definitely be stopping in more often!"}
{"text":"Having tried all the restaurants in the Playa Cabana family (with decent if not stellar feedback), I was excited to venture to Cocina Economica, having heard that it was the most authentic of the bunch.  Now perhaps it was the day that we went (after a major sporting event), but the service, food and ambience were just mediocre. The service was quite glacial, and food/drink items were mixed up several times with minimal apologies. It didn't help that were surrounded by drunken buffoons at a neighbouring table, who had a few too many rounds of tequila.  As for the food, we ordered 3 dishes plus a pitcher of sangria - all were \"fine\", but unfortunately did not blow me away. I suppose you get what you pay for, but overall, I left feeling that Toronto still has a long way to go in terms of Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Aside from the challenge of a tight seating arrangement - this place is great. A twist on the OG playa cabana (DuPont and Davenport). Anything with guac is a must and the lamb dish is spectacular. Great job!"}
{"text":"Good value. Small but awesome menu. Sharing-style. Feels like I'm in the beach in Mexico. Another win for these guys!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food in Toronto?  At Cocina Economica, the answer is an enthusiastic YES.  I pretty much had their entire menu, and all the dishes were quite good.  All the meats are served with rice, beans, corn tortillas and homemade (spicy) salsas.  The stand out dish for me was the Carnitas - falling off the bone.  I really enjoyed the vibe of this place."}
{"text":"Please don't go here. I enjoy being able to have a horchata, cheese-stuffed poblano, and ceviche on a patio in my neighborhood without waiting too long for a table.(!) Service is friendly and informed, the food comes in healthy portions, and the decor makes you feel at once like you're hanging out at your cool, well-traveled friend's home. They just really like Mexican food!  It's close quarters so you tend to strike up conversations with all the neighboring tables. The food is basic but filling and tasty. The aforementioned cheesy poblano melts in your mouth without being greasy, the fish wrapped in banana leaves is lightly seasoned and the ideal portion for two. And surprisingly the best part of the meal? Tiramisu. Trust me. Just order it. Some of the best I've ever had. Next time I'm ordering two.  Some negatives: we found a long, dark hair in our ceviche. Also the service was spotty as sometimes the servers just forgot we had asked for ice or extra sauce.  I'm sure they'll work out the kinks as they just opened."}
{"text":"Fun little neighbourhood place. Hidden away, but it has a nice little patio and looks great inside. Good sangria. The guac was great, but you don't get a lot with a single order. The main dishes are larger, though."}
{"text":"The short and simple: great restaurant with a lot of character, authentic Mexican cuisine and decor, creative, well thought out drinks and great service. The ingredients always taste fresh and of a high quality. My largest and only complaint is that there is a lack of consistency in flavour between the chefs. The 5/5 score is for Riz. It would be a 3/5 for Samantha. I still give Cocina Economica 5/5 because my first experience was so amazing. This is the first perfect score I've given.  Tip: go in the evening to feel the true charm of the restaurant and call ahead to make a reservation as it can be very busy. Make sure you also call to see who the chef is that day, only go if it's Riz. He is passionate about his food in a way that is rarely seen and even visits the region of Mexico that the dishes are based on for inspiration. Truly a one of a kind culinary artist. He is the only chef I have felt I needed to personally meet to thank for my meal.  The full story: My first time I walked in on a Wednesday evening by chance. I had the mango habanero margarita, the Oaxacan old fashioned, ceviche and sea bream wrapped in banana leaf. Riz was the chef. The ceviche CHANGED MY LIFE. Prior to tasting it I was convinced a perfect dish didn't exist, but this was everything I've dreamed of. The shrimp and scallops were prepared with a light garnish of red onion and lime juice which accented the delicate flavours of the seafood without overpowering it. The presentation was beautiful. It's so rare to find ceviche that isn't drowned in guacamole or honey or other such nonsense. I could taste the passion it was prepared with .An absolute delight.    Everyone recieves 4 salsas along with some tostadas to sample them on for free. All were amazing. They range in heat from mild with the tomato salsa to very spicy. Very flavourful.  The mango habanero margarita was very interesting. I was pleased to discover the mango is pureed in-house! Sweet, spicy and tangy, it was very well crafted and unique. The Oaxacan old fashioned was very clean and crisp, I highly recommend it. The presentation of both drinks was spot on.   The pescado empapalado (sea bream  wrapped in banana leaf) was MIND BLOWING. I've never had whole cooked fish before but Rebecca did an excellent job briefing me on the correct method of consumption. Served with delicious warm baked tostadas (as with all their entrees), rice and beans (which were generously portioned and delicious enough to be a meal on their own) and topped with fresh lettuce and an adobo sauce, it was a formidable dish. Extremely unique, well-cooked and all around delicious. Putting the fish, rice, beans, lettuce, and salsas on a tostada resulted in one of the tastiest bites I've ever had.    Price was well worth the experience. About $60 before tip. I left feeling ecstatic, fulfilled physically and spiritually and at peace. One of, if not the best culinary expeditions of my life.  My second time I went with parents for lunch  and I wish I could say the same. Service was good but not quite as friendly. The salsas were slightly less flavourful. The food lacked the LOVE of my previous encounter. My father had the guacamole, which tasted marginally better than store bought, and was not worth the $9. My mother had the chorizo vegetariano which she hated - didn't taste authentic and was very bland and watery, in her words. I had the pollo rostizado which was tasty, but the chicken was slightly dry unfortunately. The fried tostadas were a bit too salty and the baked tostadas were a bit under salted. The portions for the rice and beans were much smaller and were not nearly as tasty. Overall more of a 3 or even 2/5 experience. Given how outstanding everything was the first time, I have to conclude the chef, Samantha, is to blame. We left feeling disappointed and did not feel it was money well spent.  Their vegetarian dishes could use some new additions, there being only 4 or so.   I am basing my score on Riz being the chef. Please try his food, you will remember it forever and be glad you did. It's not worth going if he's not there."}
{"text":"shared the ceviche. it was really good. had tacos al pastor as my main. surprisingly bland--definitely wasn't cooked on a spit, the way it should be. and the pineapple was an afterthought--the pork is supposed to be cooked with it, but it looked and tasted as though they just cut it up and sprinkled on top to decorate. i had been so looking forward to it... :( the tres leches was great--definitely order that! overall it was ok, but doubt i'll go again. p.s. if you have to sit near the kitchen/bar, be prepared for a lot of noise..."}
{"text":"This place is the best Mexican restaurant in Toronto hands down. We always come here! Carnitas and barbecoa is absolutely delicious, haven't tried other mains because I'm still stuck on those two!   The manager and staff are also always super courteous and welcoming as well.  Always a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"GREAT place! I assumed we could just walk in on a weekday evening and thank goodness we were seated right away at 6:00pm, becuase this place fills up fast! Basically it's a build-your-own tacos place where you pick the main protein and you're supplied with basic taco fillings. I ordered the whole sea bream and could only eat half of it. The gauc is delicious and definitely worth your money. Will definitely come back here with other friends to spread the word!"}
{"text":"Decent food in a tiny house-turned-restaurant. I love that everything is gluten free.  A+ for that.  Limited vegetarian options are a minus, though.  Interesting Mexican water and soda menu that I would try if I visited again.  This restaurant is tucked away, but in a cool way that probably makes the regulars feel like they have their own in-crowd.  Staff was gr8!  Patio right on the street.  Easy cab ride from the heart of downtown.  Mexican Coke was smooth & delicious (said hubby).  Glad I tried it, but wouldn't rave about it.  7/1/15"}
{"text":"I loved Cocina economica, it is the most authentic mexican restaurant I have been too, the plates are perfectly sized, you can order a bunch of stuff and share family style, the margaritas are great.  It is a bit snug in there , but, that's what makes it cozy.  Great service, great food. I will go back."}
{"text":"My friends and I had to attend an event at the Berkeley street church on Thursday night so we decided to eat our dinner here before the event.   It was my second time here and first time for two of my friends. Food and dessert were great - nothing has changed since the last time I was here. Service is pretty bad though. We were ready to order in about 10 minutes after we were seated but no one came to ask us if we were ready. Couple servers passed us back and forth but it wasn't until I had to raise my hand and flag someone down when we placed our order. They charged us for something we didn't order and we felt rushed to pay the bills while we were waiting for a dessert. I completely understand the time limits on reservations and the need to clear the table for next group, but we would not have felt like we were disrespecting the time if the service was more prompt, timely and error free.   I'll come back, but probably when I have more patience and understanding for subpar service!"}
{"text":"Went today to try it out Decor: 10/10 Service: 7/10 Food: 8/10 Ambient: 9/10  Tried the ceviche which was ok nothing glorious. Needs more kick on the spices.  Tried the barbacoa: Dry but with the consome it compensated it. Rice was the only stellar appearance on the dish, like back home fellas. The   The salsas are beautiful.   It needs some refinement and the food has to come hotter, I mean sizzling.   It lacks a bit of ambient, lacks of genuine smiles more vibrant energy but they did a good job on the decor overall. The music is right on the point. Latin music.  Will come back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We didn't have a reservation and we went in around dinner time. Sat at a tiny  bar, but had the most amazing bar tender- couldn't have asked for a better seat. The drinks were delicious, food was impeccable, and the atmosphere was very fun. We started with the elotes appitizer- DELICOUS! I had the barbacoa, with a side of guac and my girlfriend had the carnitas. You couldn't go wrong with anything on the menu. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! It's a tight space, but we made a reservation and didn't have any issues. We ordered the guacamole con tostado thinking we wouldn't get chips and salsa. We were halfway through the guacamole when they brought the delicious salsas. The guacamole was so tasty, but not sure I would have ordered it knowing we got the salsa too. The salsas were some of the best I've ever had and I have eaten a ton of salsa!  For our main dishes we got the al pastor and carnitas. Both were so so so tasty! I was so stuffed and happy by the time we finished. I also had the mezcal mojito and barato--the mojito was very good and barato just okay.  The only downside to this place is the service. The service was super slow and it didn't even get that busy until the end of our dinner. It took forever for us to even be acknowledged after we sat down. Once we ordered the food came out in a timely manner, but like I said they brought the salsa out after our app. It took probably 10 minutes to get my first drink and 25 minutes to get my second! We'll definitely go back because the food is so good, but I guess I won't expect good service."}
{"text":"I'm so surprised I haven't reviewed this place, I could have sworn I had written about how delicious their food is.  I absolutely love this restaurant and it's ambience, it's not a big space so I wouldn't recommend for very large group. I prefer to sit in their patio in the summer and sip on a margarita. Their chicken main is so great!!! That sauce (beware it's spicy) is the best thing ever is to be tried with their homemade selection of sauces  (mild, medium and hot) with freshly made tortilla. You will have to make you own taco technically but that's the beauty of it.   The portions are huge and meals are slightly pricey but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I went for my Dad's birthday last weekend,we didn't have a reservation on a Saturday night, there was several people ahead of us in line, Jacob got us in the restaurant really quickly. The food was really great. We got ceviche, and elote to start. I loved both, the horchata was average, I ordered the 18$ shrimp, It did not have that much flavour, it was more spicy than flavourful. I took it home, added salt then enjoyed it. The service was good, we had questions about how the horchata was made but not answered, our server said he was new so he had no idea, he let us hanging. The bill came out to 100$ for three people so that was great. For dessert we got Tres Leches, which was so freaking good. 4/5 because the service wasn't outstanding but average. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Best carnitas I have ever had!!! We shared two pitchers of their top notch margaritas.  I highly recommend this place.  Authentic and high quality.  Our server was super friendly and gave us tips on where to continue the night on in Toronto.  I will return."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant located around Corktown. Given it's location, it is probably less known compared to city favs like La Carnita. Cocina Economica is a part of the Playa Cabana group and there are some similarities to its sister restaurants.  We ordered multiple items from their menu and tried a few of their cocktails. The ceviche dish was the largest I have ever encountered in Toronto. The ratio of shrimp and scallop to tostada was almost too high. Overall, the dish was fresh and tangy (lime).   The Carne Asada was fantastic. The meat fell off the bone and was covered in a delicious sauce.  To top it off, their cocktails were strong and very well prepared."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican, cozy and best michelada (with sauce and everything) that I ever had out of Mexico. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I went to Cocina Economica for a late dinner on a Saturday, and the food was great.  I love the authentic tasting soft corn tortillas, and the carnitas were delicious.  It's true there's not much space for moving around (probably is more of an issue in the winter with coats), but there was no one at the table next to us, so our dishes could overflow to that table.  It was fun to be able to customize your own tacos, and to get to try out the selection of five hot sauces that came out with the chips.    The waiter was friendly and attentive, and made some good recommendations.  I thought that the food was also very reasonably priced - the two of us shared two appetizers (one was the guacamole, which is moderately sized) and the carnitas, and didn't have room for dessert!  Including a sangria ($9) and a rice drink ($3), our bill was just over $60, which felt totally reasonable given the great quality and quantity of food, and the nice atmosphere.    I'll definitely be back to spend some time on the patio (and to try their dessert)!"}
{"text":"The food was good and tasty but I felt it was a bit pricey specially for the portion sizes. The $9 guacamole is literally 1 scoop with 6 tortilla chips. The mains come with only 2 really small tortillas.  The main reason I give this 2 stars is because we were saddled with this really passive aggressive waitress whose only interest was to keep pushing drinks on us. Refusal to order the drinks almost felt like I was committing a crime.  Seven lives in the Kensington beats this place on all counts: service, tasty food, portion sizes and value."}
{"text":"Top notch stuff.  Succulent meats (we had the braised beef shoulder and the pork belly) with all the fixings for more-than-you-can-reasonably-eat tacos (the dishes come with tortillas, beans, rice, and salsas for flavor). The flavor and cooking was on point; guac was also noms.  The decor was sweet and they had a nice (slightly hipster) vibe going on. Service was friendly. Unfortunately didn't try the drinks this time but they seemed promising.  Overall, a great food-preggers-inducing experience. Looking forward to returning to my new favorite Mexican place ;)"}
{"text":"Rebeca was serving us. We ordered 2 meals. My friend is from Mexico and she ordered a type of stew and I ordered Barbacoa. My dish hardly was a dish to fed me, even if my portion is small usually. She asked for a big onion chunks to be removed from the top of her stew as she did not like onion. Half of her stew was gone. When she asked about it, Rebecca answered that's how it is and she imagine because the dish changed.  We both left her tips. But I regret now. After that meal I went home and I had dinner. They also spend minimum to decorate the place."}
{"text":"I recently took my dad here for lunch. It was a busy day in this tiny restaurant. Almost all of the tables were full. But there were a couple open... I called to see if there was space, they insisted we sit at the bar.   The food was okay... I had a Mexican roommate in the past who was a excellent cook. We had the ceviche- needed lots of salt, lime juice and more curing time. We also had some sort of stuffed pepper it was decent, I might get it again if I went. We also had the beef dish. It was tender but not very exciting. That being said, my dad liked it the most out of all of the dishes we had.  The Service.... yikes!!! Since we were at the bar/ work station we could talk directly to the staff for most of our visit, which I believe was there saving grace... because it took a while for things to come & they seemed frazzled.   Would I come back?! Maybe if I wasn't paying!  PS they kept on repeating that this was an authentic Mexican restaurant... Just because you repeat something doesn't make it true."}
{"text":"The worst dining experience I have had so far.It happened a couple of months ago. The waitress was super rude.We had a reservation for 4 and asked if one more person can be accommodated.She said \"no\" right away but the place was basically EMPTY and only two-three people showed up in the next hour or so. We instisted and she reluctantly said that they can add a chair to our table. Then we were waiting on our friend and she approached our table at least 3 times to ask when she was coming.She seemed very annoyed about it for some reason. Then we ordered some appetizers I was not really impressed with.When we were done, she came to ask if we wanted anything else to eat and when we said \"no\" she visibly became irritated and slammed the menu on the table.I understand that maybe she was not having a bad day, but it was a bit too much."}
{"text":"Cozy and cool - loved the ambiance and the service was fantastic. Definitely a new neighbourhood haunt!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is incredible - not a Mexican connoisseur here, but I definitely felt that this Playa Cabana-owned joint had an authentic feel. It's a cozy location housed in a fairly residential area - I don't imagine I would have noticed it at all had I not come to hear of Playa Cabana from friends and ventured to give it a try. Tip - I would come here with one friend or two, but likely not more as the place attracts a decent crowd and I wouldn't think it'd be comfortable for a larger group.  Food was certainly pricey for what you get - lunch for one can be $15+ if you get a side along with your entrée, and the food itself was by no means exceptional. I haven't gone to some of the staples for Mexican in the city yet (La Carnita, El Caballito, etc.) but compared to where I have been recently (Mi Taco Taqueria) I didn't find it to be very special. I tried the Chile Rellenos ($12), Tostadas Fritas (potentially the Tostadas Horneadas which are oven-baked but I think it was the fritas, which are fried) and Tostadas de Nopal ($12). The Chile is essentially a stuffed pepper with mostly cheese. The Tostadas are more or less bean tacos. Your order should come with the Tostadas Fritas (these are round and fairly small tortillas) and a medley of sauces (some of these are delicious!) so I wouldn't order an extra set unless you need to :) The food was just alright and I might say a bit plain compared to what flavourful Mexican fare typically comprises - more importantly, I felt kind of sick after, as did my friends who I came here with.   While the food is just okay, the service could really, really be improved - for a crowd of ~15 between the patio and indoor sites, there were two servers who definitely seemed to be struggling to keep up with their orders. The wait for the menu and the bill were very, very long.   Overall, great vibe but an okay experience."}
{"text":"A modest exterior and cramped interior, but ay caramba their food is good!  This place is all about fresh ingredients and home-style Mexican recipes. The appetizers are familiar and on-point. We had the guacamole and scallop and shrimp ceviche that came with tostadas. Very tasty and a cut above most we've tried before. The entrees revolve around varying meat options that you self-serve into toasty tortilla wrappers with beans, rice, fresh greens and pepper sauces. You will not be disappointed with the flavours or the portions! We tried the classic al pastor (charred pork and pineapple), pollo rostizado (chicken in roasted pepper sauce) and lamb barbacoa. DELISH!   The food quality is very, very good, but given the cramped eating situation (almost elbow to elbow), average service (slow on entree delivery and charging for extra tortillas without notice) I did have to dock a star.  If it wasn't for those smaller experiential downsides I'd be inclined to give perfect marks for taste alone.  Definitely worth a try, but make a reservation given limited seating."}
{"text":"This place is small and hidden away on a small street but the food is great and service very fast.  The Al Pastor dish is my favourite, the flavours really penetrate the meat and you can really taste the smokiness. Portions are just  right, you won't be leaving hungry at all.   If you love real Mexican cuisine definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Some good friends have been telling me about this restaurant and how good the food is...so a couple of weeks ago, we made plans to have dinner here...I was excited about going to an authentic authentic Mexican restaurant and not for tacos...the place is small with an upstairs dining area and a patio...the restaurant is decorated with many Mexican artifacts...the music was not loud and just dancy enough to keep you bopping in your seat...the wait staff are friendly, knowledgeable and patient...first order were drinks: a must try is the delicious margarita, although, it could get served in a bigger glass, but it's very good...we were served complimentary tostadas with several different spicy sauces, the best for me was the smoky pepper sauce...guacamole and ceviche were ordered for appetizers...the guacamole was a bit chunky, which I prefer, served with twice fried tortilla chips...amazingly flavourful...the ceviche, with shrimp and bay scallops, was \"cooked\" in lime juice and piled high over tortillas...I was instructed to cut down on the chip to get the best results...this was the best ceviche I've had in a very long time...my main was Al Pastor, seasoned pork grilled with pineapple and pickled onions...this dish came with warm corn tortillas, rice and beans...in a word: amazing flavours, perfectly grilled, extremely delicious...one friend ordered the sea bream which I was lucky to try...the fish was beautifully cooked in mole seasoning...it was a wonderful dining experience with great friends...I look forward to going back there."}
{"text":"We had our post Christmas Christmas staff party here. 30 people in a small place isn't easy but the food was amazing and they did their absolute best! I'd recommend this place for any gathering! Private room upstairs, great music, your own bar!"}
{"text":"I'll be very short on this. Exceptional ambient, excellent food and service. But just when I thought \"finally a restaurant without or with almost unnoticeable music\" it started nothing less but idiotic reggaeeton! Song after song with same brain-washing rhythm. Why? Why? This is cozy small place with friendly warm atmosphere, not a club for chicks in high heels looking for sugar daddies. With a heavy heart I have to take one star off just for that reason."}
{"text":"A very small intimate place, with friendly staff.  Hard to find a decent mexican restaurant in Toronto that serves more than burritos. Rarer still is one in the east end.   Ordered a tacos al pastor which actually had corn tortillas, the pork comes on a plate with fried beans and rice and you get a selection of sauces, onions and limes. With a beer, tax and tip came to under 25 dollars. For that price, you sure can't beat that."}
{"text":"My new fave spot!!  The food was amazing! all you want from mexican. full of flavours. nice, casual atmosphere. Service was a little slow, since they just started the business. Definitely coming back.  I ordered: Salsa, guacamole  5/5       1/2lb costillas de cochinita (pork) $16 - my fave of the night! oh man! that hot sauce was so hot, but so addicting! bald flavour!  4.5/5    1/2lb Plolo Rostizadotop $14 - my second fave of the night. very different flavour from the  costillas de cochinita. the chicken was juicy and tender. all the spices work out well in a harmony. 4.5/5    Ceviche $9 - nice and refreshing 4/5       1/2 lb Res En Salsa Verde(beef flank). good dish with good flavour. but sorry, the pork and chicken were too good!  Sangria $7 - all you want for the night."}
{"text":"This place was a bit of a miss for me.  When it comes to Mexican food I look for flavour.  My food was overall bland.  Not bad but just not good.  Guacamole was fresh but nothing out of the ordinary garden store variety.  The Al Pastor plate was plentiful but a little tough and just tasted as if it were done from a diner griddle. Same with the Barbacoa.  Big plate but somehow missing big and bold flavourS. The Tres leches cake was good but not to die for.  The service was very attentive and warm.  The surrounding was casual and crowded. However,I would not necessarily come back here again.  Really I feel I could have made the food they served at home."}
{"text":"Bee here twice now.  Once for lunch, and once for dinner.     The first time I went with my coworkers.  We were served salsas and fried tortillas as soon as we sat down, which is always a nice touch.  I ordered to Res en Salsa Verde. It was tasty on its own but when I added chili diablo(which you can ask for)to the dish, it took it to another level.  Everyone of us enjoyed our meals there, although some people who only ordered from bocaditos menu might have been a bit hungry still.  Second time, I took my wife there shortly after my first visit, because she loves Mexican food and I was working late.  She ordered the Pollo Rostizado, and I ordered the Barbocao.  My wife can only finish half of the 1/2lb Pollo Rostizado, the rest became my lunch for the next day.  While the Pollo was good, the Barbocao was what I really enjoyed.  First, I love lamb. With Barbocao, you essentially get lamb two ways.  You get a plate of slow cooked lamb, as well as a bowl of lamb consomme.   You can optionally dip the meat in the consomme as you eat if you prefer.   The lamb was good, eating the lamb while dipping it in the consomme was better, and just drinking the consomme was my favourite part of the meal.  Did I say I love lamb?  One thing I noticed though, was while that while the entrees packed a lot of value, the bocaditos is hard to judge in terms of size/pricing.  For example, a guacamole is $9 vs Al Pastor(1/2 lb) at $13, seems a bit odd.    Service was good both times.  Servers were very friendly, accommodating, and polite.  Awesome people.  Recommended, and will go again for sure."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! The food is genuine, no Tex-Mex in sight. Ceviche, Carnitas and quac were on point. They made a damn good margarita as well!"}
{"text":"Great summer restaurant. I've only been in the summer months - love the quaintness of the restaurant, the minuscule patio and brightly painted chairs never fail to make me happy. Although from the most recent visit I noticed they have update their plating into plain white plates for their entree.   Charm aside, the staffs are always cheery, and the food is delicious. Come early to grab a spot on warmer days, you won't regret it. Great ceviche, and the carnita is sumptuously filling."}
{"text":"Growing up in a Mexican-American household, I have had a lot of experience with good and not-so-good Mexican food. This is definitely up to par with one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to in Toronto. My husband and I ordered the carnitas entrada, which gave us enough to make ~5 tacos. Their rice and beans were amazing. I also tried some of the salsas they offered at the beginning and thought they were great! I am going to recommend this place to my in-laws so that they can give it a try the next time they're here."}
{"text":"Amazing fish! You get an entire fish and can make your own tacos! Make sure to keep the hot sauces from the seafood ceviche. Amazing service and great food!"}
{"text":"Amazing. The bartender with the glasses is great. The food is yummy. Best place for Mexican food!!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: Food was delicious and authentic, very cool decor and intimate feel, great sauces with nachos.   Cons: Despite having made a reso we were seated at an awkwardly shaped table that was crammed, different people at our table served at different times, drinks very expensive.  Verdict: Would recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant experience could be summed up in one word, \"WOW\"! This to me is the embodiment of what a great restaurant should and must be! Cocina Economica has set a new gold standard for me to hold as far as how high I should set my future standards in service, products, and overall experiences. For such a quint small place, situated off the beaten path, this restaurant packed in quite a personality from their food to their staff. We walked into a restaurant that was so vibrant in color and life that I felt I was transported to a different time and place. The staff were so friend, so enthusiastic that it was contagious. Greeted by so much positivity from both the staff and fellow dinners that it was opened me up.  The vibrancy of the setting was reflected in their menu as well. The menu was not too small and yet did not overwhelm its dinner with complication. The servers so willingly explain each item with such articulate descriptions that it left a lasting impression. Service and food was just on point. I really wanted to try authentic Mexican Horchata, but unfortunately they were completely depleted...my seconds of disappointment was short-lived as the bartender without missing a beat sent me a free substitute drink to ease my whininess-hehe. I truly appreciated the gesture! It goes beyond that, each time our food came, we were explained what it is and the preparation for it. Simply service at its best! The food. Simply delicious. Not complicated, unpretentious, utter great eats. The Mise en place of various fixings and tortilla chips was much appreciated. Taste was filled with vibrancy with every new bite. The flavours of the main dishes was well complimented and the texture their meats shows how it was so expertly prepared. Definitely rustic food done well. The meal was simple and interactive, diners as able to build their own Taco - the plates were sharable. The price is reasonable for the portion and level of service; I would gladly dish out that amount for the experience we received with no hesitations. Overall, there is no complaint to be made. By far one of the best overall dining experiences I've had in a very long time. A definite must try! 5-star and 2 thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked within narrow streets and is definitely a hidden gem. I was visiting the Christmas Market nearby and wanted to try restaurants around the area outside of Distillery District and Cocina Economica came up on Yelp.   Was I thoroughly pleased!   The decor is cozy/quaint/quirky/different - you name it! It's hard to find one word which describes it accurately. With the number of Mexican restaurants booming around Toronto, I'm surprised this one managed to remain fairly off the radar and wasn't crowded with lineups.   Every table is served with tortillas and sauce. We ordered the ceviche to start, followed by shrimp and beef shank entrees to share between two people. Each entree comes with beans, rice, and tortilla wraps, and the portions were generous. So be prepared to get your hands dirty!  Our server was friendly and willing to explain lots of the dishes to us, so overall it was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Came here on a group lunch and we had a great experience.  I had the barbacoa which was a nice big helping of goat. Meat was tender and not overly spiced. The rice and beans it came with was spicy though. Also had the guacamole and ceviche. Both were nice and fresh. If I were to decide between the 2,get the ceviche. The latte was amazing. I'll be back to just get that. Lol   Pros: Food, Service, Atmosphere, and the Coffee!   Cons: Expensive, long wait time for food, small and tight seating room"}
{"text":"Very cute cozy restaurant. Good service and Their Molcajete is pretty tasty and so hot at the beginning."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 3.5 stars. The atmosphere was cool, the food was okay. I enjoyed the ceviche but the pork dish was dry. I was hoping to enjoy this restaurant more than expected. The service however was much too slow. Took forever to pay the bill."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and vibe : excellent.   Service: good. Food: ok to good.  Value for $$ : ok.   The place definitely has style and is a cozy small joint.  Perfect for smaller crowds.  We went for a small lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  Ordered two mains (al pastor, and the beef verde taco dishes). Also some chips and guacamole to start.    Service was good, we were taken care of, and had no issues getting food and more water etc.   The food was good. But it was not as good as I expected.  I found the beef dish to be a bit bland while the pork while slightly too salty.  I still prefer the cheaper but better tasting tacos at a certain Kensington joint.  And about price you are paying $15+ for essentially a taco / fajita dish."}
{"text":"I came here at the suggestion of a friend. Definitely a hole in the wall, but those are my favourite places. We grabbed a table on the patio since it was a nice day out and ordered a couple of beers. The food was delicious and much more authentic than most mexican restaurants in the city. My only complaint is that the table was too small for all the dishes that were brought out, we had to keep our tortillas on the unused chair."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. First off, the place has a great ambiance to it. Small and cozy. We had the guacamole as an app and it didn't disappoint. My margaritas were on par as well. Had the chorizo veggie tacos and they were honestly some of the most flavorful tacos I've ever tasted. I love how they let you construct the tacos however you like. You can make them as spicy or mild or medium. Whether your just visited Toronto or live close by give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So I was here by myself. While everyone around me got complimentary chips and guacamole I got none. The food was so small in portion and tasted awful. Def won't come back."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for helping me find this gem. Authentic Mexican in a cozy space on Berkeley Street."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, really cute place. Food looks nice and is not bad. It just doesn't taste like Mexican food. The ingredients are there, but the nuance of cooking, maybe how they roast their chilis and the combination of spices, doesn't taste authentic. The quac, I don't taste that balance of red onion, lime, salt, jalepeno, cilantro, garlic, a touch of olive oil. Tortilla strips look nice, but is too thick and dense. I want my chip to be light, crisp and thin. Crunch, gone."}
{"text":"Service is amazing . Ashley our waitress makes great recommendations. The guac is soooo good."}
{"text":"The food is beautiful!   This little hole in the wall restaurant is a wonderful surprise. I've been there several times now. Heart value for the money.  So far over had the Al Pastor, Barbacoa and Carnitas de Pancita. All flavorful meals in generous portions. For dessert we've had the Tres Leches (our favorite) and the Pastel Impossible (quite good).  I've been there on date nights and with groups.  My only complaint; and it's a silly way to ruin such a great experience, you order extra tostadas, they never arrive but are there on the bill. This has happened about three times now.     The last time, we asked three times for an order of tostadas which never came. However the bill had us down for three orders of tostadas. When we told our server, we were completely shot down and were told we had to pay. It was only a couple of bucks but the experience left a poor taste.   So, we no longer order extra tostadas.   Other than that, the food and price are well worth it."}
{"text":"Ended up here with my fiance and a friend after a beer event across the street. We didn't have reservations and waited about 20 minutes to get a table. Totally ok as it was super super busy.  When we were seated, we decided to order chips plus guac to start. For my main, I chose the stuffed poblano pepper, bae got the beef tacos and our friend chose the lamb dish (can't remember the name!).  Although everything arrived at the same time (ie our app arrived with our mains), our server was really nice and apologized to us. No worries, we were starving at this point and just wanted to eat.  I really enjoyed my dinner and my dining companions said the same. We also enjoyed all of the various hot sauces brought to the table to accompany our meals.  Would definitely come back if in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place! super small with a super cute outdoor patio in the front   Been here dining in and got it for take out and both times was great! Got the Al Pastor which was pork leg with pineapple - delish! the pineapple really makes it, its sweet and savory. The Res in Salsa Verde - braised beef with tomatillo also amazing! The beef was soft, like a stew, it felt hearty and homey.   Everything also comes with rice, beans and corn tortillas (in a basket to keep them warm!) to make your own tacos. Each table also gets a variety of salsa with a tostada to dip. The portions are large and I leave extremely full after.   Service is friendly, the food is unpretentious and just feels homey with the large sharing plates. I love tacos and this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Confused feelings. Maybe my expectations were too high. Also the price point makes absolutely no sense - it's way too expensive for what you get. See below.  It's a small but cozy place. I'm sure the service could have been good, but I went at an odd time and the waiter disappeared to help other employees with something.  Food was on the more authentic side (less Tex Mex) but still kinda meh.  Salsas: delicious. Had a classic spicy tomato salsa and a jalapeno salsa. Habanero salsa was also there, but given the spice of the normal ones, I didn't venture to try it... Chicken tinga tostadas: Good flavor, quite spicy (I'm Indian and eat spicy food, and this was still pretty spicy, so gringos beware) Camarones de guajillo (shrimp): I found these quite flavorless. I'm natually biased against shrimp you have to peel and devein yourself because your hands smell for hours and it's a lot of work. But the sauce itself also wasn't impressive.  Tres leches cake: I love tres leches, so this was the highlight. Not as sweet/dense as some other places, but sometimes you don't need the extra cream anyway!  Overall, glad I tried it, but I would at least order a different main dish. But it's also more expensive than it's worth. I was pretty confused why my bill here was almost as much as my bill at Richmond Station and as much as my bill at Los Colibris (\"fine dining\" Mexican)."}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't write a review of cocina economica yet! I've been here several times, I discovered this paradise (haha) by a friend of mine and I was blown away, I'm mexican, from Mexico city, I know what mexican food should taste like and I also know what mexican inspired food taste like (I had a lot of that living here) ok, we'll this is real mexican food, it's like going to your aunts house and having traditional mexican food. I've tried pretty much everything in the menu and I like everything in the menu haha...  I have a few favourites  Barbacoa Tacos de ceviche  Bistec en salsa verde  Guac (obvi)   And please save some space for the dessert!!   Pastel de tres leches..  Omg  I also want to mention the staff, everyone is so great!  Ashley, gavo, and I can't remember the name of the cook but she is great, one time my hubby And I ordered so much food she came out to say hi and to help the server place it on the table (we eat a lot)  Love the atmosphere as well, the music is on point and the decor.  Make sure you make a reservation cuz the place is really really small.   Ooooh almost forgot! Dave's Margarita..  Sooo good"}
{"text":"Definitely THE hidden Gem in Corktown!  The flavours and presentation is lovely with Tortilla baskets and 5 spices to choose from for your soft shell taco entradas. The ceviche is to DIE FOR and the guacamole is  so fresh with the crunchiest tortilla chips that are never greasy. I recommend al pastor if you're a first timer here with the guacamole chips as a appetizer.  The restaurant is indeed very small with 7 tables but it's cozy with so many decorations to look at. In love with the place, no wonder they're busy all the time! Best family-style Mexican I had in the city so far and it also reminds me of the LES in Manhattan :) LOVE"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great place for a first date or a 100th date. Once you step foot into this resto, you'll be emersed with festive music and cultural decor. Our server, Drew, was v hospitable and, surprisingly, the other customers we encountered were just as accommodating. The mains are flavourful and the cool thing about them is that you can choose how you want to eat your meal: wrapped in a soft tortilla, packed onto a hard tortilla, with rice and pinto beans, or the meat/veggies itself. The range of sauces were definitely appealing too: jalapeño, roast onion salsa, chopped onions/cilantro/lime, habañero, and arbol sauce."}
{"text":"YUM! Please get their signature dessert tres leches cake with dulce de leche!!  It was truly one of the best first bites I have ever had in MY LIFE. Main dishes we ordered were good but because the cake was SOO good I should mention it first. They offer authentic Mexican dishes meaning you are not limited to burritos, tacos, or quesadillas. I ordered a braised beef shoulder dish that comes with fried rice and beans. Meats were tender and the sauce was full of flavor.   Overall, friendly service, great atmosphere, and great food! If I have one complaint about this place, tables are too close to each other."}
{"text":"This was the best Mexican food I have eaten.  I honestly wasn't expecting much. It's kinda in the middle of nowhere in a sense. We were looking for it, not realizing it was a restaurant converted from a house. And when you get inside it's super cramped. But once you taste the food you will fall in love. I had the carnitas. Was really good. The meat is served with guacamole, homemade salsa, and a spicy sauce. And of course you get the tortilla. Yes you make it yourself. But it adds to the fun. Was good food and fun. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem in Toronto. Located in a small space in a the middle of no where, you can find the most authentic Mexican dishes around. Serving such classics such as Carne Asada and chicken enchiladas that bring you into a Mexican home. The price point was fair for what you get and it is quite filling.  The restaurant is a small intimate space, that seats less than 20 people so space is very limited! But once you're inside its as if you're a guest in someone's home waiting for dinner. They bring out fresh guacamole, tortillas that are still warm off the press and some of the most intense hot salsa I've had in Toronto!   Come check this place out as soon as you can and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food with a lively and cozy atmosphere and very attentive service. Staff were super welcoming and very friendly, food was great and portion sizes were alright for dinner. It's definitely more traditional Mexican food rather than the simple tacos and burritos you normally get. The space itself is on the smaller end, so seating is a bit cozier and getting through between tables is a bit awkward."}
{"text":"Interesting/OK/Fair experience.  Cool, authentic decor (unlike the mod/hip/trendy Mexi places in the city). We waited for 5 mins for seating at the upstairs bar on a Saturday night (without reso). Upstairs is cozy - in my opinion, better than downstairs. We ordered our drinks and food with Melissa - she was the highlight of our time at Cocina. Our food took ~45-60 mins, including a basic app of guac + chips. Melissa felt really bad and so she comped us a round of Margarita's and Mezcol shots post-meal. She knew a ton about tequila, drinks and the various Mexican regions; It was great chatting with her.   The verdict: - Sangria - I had a glass of the red which was pretty boozy. Could definitely taste the tequila, so good if you enjoy boozy sangria. - We don't typically drink Margaritas, and these were AMAZING. No added sugars; all natural. I'd come back just for the Margaritas. - Guac - we've definitely had better. It was quite 'pureed' - Cevice - great, fresh - Soy vegetarian entree - just fair... came with soy ground, beans and rice with warm soft corn tortillas so you could build yourself. It was... Meh. The toppings were the highlight - a jalapeño puree, salsa and cilantro with lime.   Overall, we were disappointed with our food and the wait. Melissa more than compensated, however, and we would definitely come back for the Margaritas alone."}
{"text":"Reviewing as a vegan with severe dairy allergy.  This restaurant can not accommodate you if you're dairy free. If you notice the menu says \"guacamole with queso fresco\" and you ask \"sin queso\" you will not only still get it but then have the restaurant tell Foodora that \"they never put dairy in the guacamole, but they can't be sure about any of their other foods\".   Really disappointing that the beans also had cheese on top and the salsa verde seemed like it had crema in it, but they couldn't tell me for sure.   The taco shells themselves were not as good as at Tacos 101. That and a spicy red salsa is what I ended up eating. They were medium to moderately good. They should have let me know after the 3 notes I sent them about dairy allergy that they were unable to accommodate me."}
{"text":"Toronto has an amazing food scene but it struggles a lot to provide great Mexican, and this place is no exception. The flavours are fine - it's not bad as such - but it just doesn't stand out. You can do better in various parts of Kensington Market for less money and frankly you should."}
{"text":"I didn't know it is a Playa Cabana chain restaurant until I see the bill! It was yesterday, a day with freezing rain. When I called in and made reservation in the Morning, I didn't think it'd be a full house on a day like this( April snow). I'm so glad that I did when I arrived this hidden gem in a not so busy neighbourhood.   We ordered cheese Jalapeño for starter, osso buco and braised lamb for main. Everything was delicious!!!! So richly infused with all kinds of spices! The cheese jalapeño looks a little unpleasant under the red neon light, but after the first bite, we are totally sold!! Both osso buco and braised lamb come with tostadas and beans and rice, no need to order separately. The portion was quite generous for two girls, next time we will probably cut one main and do one more starter.   My only criticism would be the size of the table. For Mexican food, it'd be great if we have a little bigger table for the many dishes. But I understand that it is built upon a small townhouse, won't be able to have so many people if the table is bigger.   Advise before going:   1,it's going to be fully packed, make your reservation early.  2, it's going to be loud, don't expect to sit in a quite corner.  3, ask the waiter for recommendation, they give great tips!"}
{"text":"Super cute & cozy spot in the T dot for authentic home-cooked Mexicana. Portions are decent, not like a Tex-mex size. Ceviche appetizer was delish and decent for three to share. The rice and beans that come with your meat entree was mmmmmmmmmm..... Ambience and staff makes this joint a relaxing and friendly hang out spot."}
{"text":"Finally good and authentic Mexican food in Toronto.  I was sure that Mexican cuisine was some sort of culinary achilles heel in this Mexo-challenged Burgh, but with this and El Rey, this might be finally changing.  I was encouraged when the tostadas and salsas they brought out to start actually had....good flavour and some finesse.  I was taken aback when the main course of carnitas (fantastic) tasted like more than just pulled pork with a little cumin, and had some welcome acidity.  I was positively gobsmacked when the chicken rostizado came in a tart adobo sauce that didn't taste like anything resembling Frank's red hot.   Did I just have Mexican food in a place with flavours that resembled Mexico or the US Southwest?  The one downside?  The music was jazz and then Caribbean latin and salsa.  No, no, no!  Salsa is not Mexican music, even if some Puerto Rican dude did a snazzy cover of Lobo Domesticado some years back.  I want REAL Mexican music in my Mexican Restaurants, which means more than some ancient Ranchera.  I'm docking a star until I get some authentic Mexican Music."}
{"text":"Great meal! The spice is more than adequate and service is mostly friendly- but make sure you rsvp as they are not always able to take in walkins.  The space is small and cozy with an authentic decor- but it is small and the wait staff is typically rushing to and from the patio."}
{"text":"Made a reservation here and arrived promptly at 7:30pm ready to eat. I was pretty dismayed having to wait until 745pm despite having the reservation. In fact I was already thinking \"minus one star\" in my head. The waiter was very courteous though and apologized several times and offered to grab us some drinks while we waited.  Cocina Economica is a pretty tiny place, maybe seating 30 inside and a small patio out front. It was jam packed and I expect it to remain that way, so make a reservation!  We were seated in a corner nook of the bar area which was perfect, direct access to the drinks and could slightly view into the kitchen.  The menu consists of 10-15 tapas style smaller portions and 5-6 entrees. All reasonably priced. I opted for the pastor, $13, which is pork served with pineapple. Came with a side of rice and beans and hot tortillas to eat the meat with. We also shared a guacamole $9. You are served a trip of salsas to start and the waiter made us some free drinks to try, a Mexican drink with rice milk and cinnamon on ice, which was very refreshing.  The food was delicious, I definitely recommend the carne pastor.  Decor is very cool and very Mexican. Waitstaff all super friendly.  An easy 5 star given that our bill only came to $60 before tip, which was food for 3 people and a couple coronas!  Voy a volver!!!"}
{"text":"I came here once for lunch and had my rehearsal dinner here because it was close to my wedding venue.  For the rehearsal dinner, I had 13 people and the staff gave us the entire upstairs of the house. The upstairs had bar stools and small tables around, but did not have one table that fit 13 people. At first, we wanted to put all the tables together so we could all sit together, but the server recommended that they serve the food on a table and instead of sitting together, we can grab plates and mingle around. At first, I didn't like the idea because I felt everyone would be separated, but then I was super glad we did it because we got to mingle around and talk to people at our own pace as opposed to being restricted at the large table. It's a great place to have a small party for sure. We ordered everything on the menu and everything tasted was amazing! The food is authentic Mexican, but with a street style twist. We even had left overs that they packed up for us! The drinks are done with a strong hand, which I loved! All our guests had fun and enjoyed the chill atmosphere and food before our big day.   The servers were friendly and the food came pretty quickly. All in all, a great place to have a rehearsal dinner or small party of 15 and under."}
{"text":"I really like the restaurant. It's very detailed and cozy. The service was good too. It did get full house later in the evening, around 8pm, all the seats were taken.   The food is tastey, very filling. The rice was so flavourful, I could eat it on its own.   For dessert, we got the tres leche and the chocolate cake and caramel flan. The tres leche was way more sweeter that the chocolate cake and I think the desserts are more on the robbery side of the cost. It was $9 for a small piece of cake and granted it was good, but it's basically half or more than half the cost of an actual meal... So... Think about that lol.   I like the sauces and the salsa that they gave with the free appetizer. It was a good start. I don't think there's anything crazy about their menu that I've never had before, but I gave it a five star because the food is overall pretty good and I could see myself go back here again. It's worth checking out.   The only thing I didn't like about this place is it got super, super loud. We caught ourselves shouting because it was just too loud.   Its a small nook, so pack it with people, what can you expect. Either way, it's still a good place to try out."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend Cocina Economica enough - I've been here three times and the food and atmosphere are always incredible, and it's even friendly on the budget!   I would generally suggest making a reservation, as it's pretty small inside and draws a decent lunch and dinner crowd. On my most recent trip with a coworker for a birthday lunch, we shared the tostadas with guacamole which was delightful, a great starter size to share, with fantastic and very creamy guac.   We then each had the carnitas for the main, which always SEEMS like it's a small portion, but it really, really is not. The meat comes on its own plate, along with a side plate of rice and beans, and a selection of sauces and basic toppings (onions and lime, cilantro, two sauces and a selection of hot sauce) and really, the flavour is the meat is complex enough that the few add-ins are all you could need. It's also served with a basket of warm tortillas and some for tostadas.   The drinks here are a bit expensive, but I had the margarita with habanero, which they customize to your spice preference which was fiery and refreshing. The desserts are a pretty small selection and are, I think only average. We had the chocolate cake/ flan to share, and it was a generous portion. Try this palce out for sure!"}
{"text":"Saw great reviews online so my friends and I decided to come here for dinner.  We ordered the guacamole, ceviche and al pastor all to share.  The guacamole was really good, with the perfect amount of spice!  The homemade chips that came with the guac was amazing as well.  The ceviche had a good amount of shrimp and scallop, and the marinate was perfect for a starter.  The Al Pastor entree came with rice, beans and tortillas which was really nice when eaten together.  I wasn't very fond of the tortillas (it was quite floury), but I still enjoyed the dish.  We REALLLYYY wanted to try the tres leches cake for dessert but sadly they were sold out early, so we had the pastel impossible instead (chocolate cake baked with flan).  The pastel impossible was good, but next time I would definitely like to try the tres leches!  The food was delicious and the decor was super cute!  The place is small and it is a tight squeeze, but I think it adds something to the experience :)"}
{"text":"I went here with my family and fiancee for a birthday dinner. We ordered a couple appetizers for the table and each got an entree. The food was really delicious and presented so beautifully. They have a lot of yummy Mexican drinks like hibiscus water and rice milk (which the server brought to my fiancee when he tried a super hot pepper). As someone who is gluten intolerant I liked that there was a star beside the items that weren't gluten free (which were only 2). The service was great, the atmosphere was really cozy and made you feel like you were in city in Mexico. They have a great patio out front as well as a good amount of seating inside. I hope to go back and try the Sangria :)"}
{"text":"Wow this is an amazing place for Mexican food! It's very small and cute, with seating both indoors and outdoors.   Everything was super delicious. They have appetizers, and the main dishes are mostly tacos. They serve the dish, rice and beans, and tortillas separately so you can make your own taco. I really liked the chicken one, with the taste of sour tomatoes in the sauce.  The tres leches in desert section is my absolutely favorite! The whipped cream topping is fluffy and not sweet. It goes perfectly with the condensed milk soaked cake.  I absolutely recommend this place if you feel like some Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with this restaurant.  I've been to the main playa cabana on dupont and I expected much more.  They brought me cold chicken tingas which i even asked the waitress who said that was normal.  The mojito was bleh and the tostadas  were cold and didnt seem homemade like the location on dupont. And finally the beef they served was dry and poor quality"}
{"text":"Nice little place on Queen East. Cool vibe and a delicious tres leches cake. Everything else including Main dishes, sauces, and guac are super salty."}
{"text":"Excellent service, incredible food and very reasonable prices.   The chile relleno and the smoked chicken taco app was our groups favourite. The guacamole is the best in the city!!   Our group shares everything we ordered.  The most expensive items were the cocktails the mains average 15$ a plate and the serving size was generous.  We all loved everything about this place.   The service was the best I have experienced in a very long time."}
{"text":"Given the area of where this resturant is located, it sure is a hidden gem. My boyfriend and I came into the spot on a Monday night to where it looked packed from what we saw through the window, once we got in, we saw that it was rather small - lucky for us we were able to get a table. The interior and ambiance set a nice cozy vibe as we sat down and felt as if we weren't even in corktown. The servers were super nice to explain the menu, make reccomendations in asking us what sorts of flavors we enjoy in order to point out what would satisfy our pallets that night.  We ended up sharing guac and chips as our starter; which came with delicious house made chips, as well as the chivice; which we both devoured in an instant! We also decided on getting the carnitas as our main, which were delicious and came with fresh made flour tortillas along with house made salsas, and chili oils that we got to add on to spice up our tacos - I rather enjoined the concept of building our own tacos with the various toppings that were given, so that both my bf and I could alter our spice preferences!   This place is definitely a spot to come with a goid group of friends as the dishes are meant to be shared with it being a tapas styled resturant. Will most likely be looking into visiting this place again."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing Mexican food. I've visited so many times, and I've never been let down. I've tried everything on their menu, with a fully satisfied stomach each time!!"}
{"text":"There are limited # of restaurants in the area , this place was decent. The restaurant ambiance is small and cozy. Seats about maybe ~20 people, our group took up 1/3 of the seating area.   Recommend ordering the guacamole, the chips are very delicious.  I came here with a group of 8, we ordered a variety of dishes and everyone enjoyed it. I got the lamb, the meat was tender and well seasoned.   Ordered the hibiscus juice made in house, it was too sour.   Food quality: 3.5/5 Service : 4/5 Price : 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time here, the food was great, service was attentive and it was very cozy. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and authentic. I liked that the tostadas for the guac were baked, not fried. Guac was delicious. Not spicy but you have the option to spicy it up w Playa Cabana's 2 amazing hot sauces, the smokey one and the habanero one. These sauces are so good. We had the beef shoulder.. Very tasty, meat was perfectly cooked. I like that u make your own taco bc u can load it up any which way u like. The rice and beans were delish too. This is the best Mexican I've had in Toronto so far. Only downfall, the margaritas are so small... I knuckle too many back."}
{"text":"Went in late they are about to close the kitchen but they are nice enough to let us take our time to order. We had shrimp and scallop ceviche as appetizer and braised beef shoulder in salsa verde. The sauces and tacos comes with the dishes elevated and complimented the dish so well. Sauces are different levels of spiciness so you could customize your dish on your own that's always better idea. The dish itself is not overpowering. Ceviche are very fresh loaded with big chunks of shrimps and scallops they offer more hard taco shells they are very addictive could taste the fresh corn. Guacamole doesn't come for free though. The soft taco marries so well with braised beef rice and beans and salsa salsa more salsa lol. Rice and beans are very flavorful not your kind of plain rice but tossed in spices besides eating wit hand is always more fun. Can't wait to go back to try more tasty dishes."}
{"text":"Sub-medium-grade food with heaps of hipster pretentiousness. Do your Foodora driver/cyclist a favour and do not order from here. (Edit: I did not finish my food from here).  I walked through the front door by myself, the servers in the back didn't bother coming up to me. I walked to the back and asked for my Foodora pickup. They told me to go through the back door (yes, not the main door... the service entrance/garbage dump) to get my food. I've been to places that are $$$ and $$$$ on Yelp and they did not force the pickups to be through the service entrance.   I ordered three items: Carne Asada ($12.00), Barbacoa ($19.00), and Arroz a La Mexicana ($3.00).   As you will quickly see in the photos below, I got 2 tacos (which I am supposed to get) and one empty tortilla. Whoot! These were ok tacos. It's not worth it - I found much better ones at the Mucho Burrito under my building.  The Barbacoa (which is basically lamb) was not that great either - it might be my disdain for the restaurant still speaking. Actually, that's not it - the lamb isn't the most tender for the way it's cooked and barely tastes like lamb - if I was in China, I would think that this was fake lamb meat. For much less, I had better lamb at Jerk King... If you are in the area, do yourself a favour and take your money to \"Under The Table\" - where the wait staff are amazing and the food is great and cheap, the oxtail and I bet everything else there is way better and about 2/3rds the price of this place.  The Mexican rice (which they said would be purple rice... was not purple). It's the same on in the Barbacoa, which the rice was ok - it was a bit mushy though.  Overall, don't send your Foodora driver/cyclist there and make them feel like s**t about themselves because of the pretentiousness here. They don't even wrap the food that they put in the paper bag with a plastic bag. Now I have a weird lamb smell in my car."}
{"text":"For a city of such diversity, Toronto suffers from a dearth of Mexican cuisine.  Most Torontonians will be very familiar with tacos - and in fact, if they saw the rest of Mexican cuisine, may assume that everything within Mexican food is a play on the taco.  But what distinguishes Mexican food are the spices in their sauces (from the variety of chilis that grow in the region), and the use of corn (most notably in tortillas).   Tortillas have, in some way, been bastardized in North America. Many of the tortillas that you see in the supermarket have been loaded with preservatives, leading to a rubbery or gummy taste.   Here's the thing - true Mexican food is extremely hard to make in Toronto. The best that we can do will never match what you can have in Mexico, simply because of the availability of fresh ingredients.  For that reason, I've yet to find much GREAT Mexican food in the city. That said, Cocina Economica gets quite close. The sauces are similar to what I remember from Mexico, and the cocktails are solid."}
{"text":"Cocina economica has an adorable and cozy interior and a misleading name.  While the prices aren't TOO crazy,  it would be quite a stretch to call it cheap,  no matter what language.   My boyfriend ordered the res en salsa Verde,  a flavourful,  moist,  and unique blend that we loved.  My carnitas however lacked a certain tear apart quality that you usually get with carnitas.  They were still delicious,  it's really hard to mess up pork belly.    I appreciated the 'make your own taco'  style of dining.  Makes it a little more fun than just getting some made Tacos on a plate and eating in silence.   The sauces and hot sauces were great; reminded me of my families style.   Over it was good.  Perhaps a little more attention was paid to decor and atmosphere than recipes,  but even so the food was satisfying.    PS no debit accepted! Cash or credit only!!"}
{"text":"Favorite taco spot in Toronto! The chicken tinga is amazing! Make sure to try all the salsas too."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in town! Family style servings and food tastes legit. The deconstructed tacos are a great way to share with the family. We've been here a few times and it never disappoints. It gets quite busy for dinner, make sure to make early reservations.   One tip, try the ceviche campechano."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's because it was a new experience for us, but all 3 of us felt like it was one of the best places we have ever eaten in Toronto. The food was delicious and they offered complementary tortillas with sauces that tasted quite amazing. Fresh tortillas were provided with our 3 entrées. We had chosen 2 pork belly & ribs dishes called Carnitas, and then 1 beef shoulder dish. I personally liked the Carnitas as I felt the other dish was quite beefy. If I could go there again then I would definitely find the opportunity but it is quite filling and I would only go if I was really feeling Mexican food at the time. I also recommend getting a horchata if the food is too spicy."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars really. It's really very nice. The vegetarian chorizo is a nice option, and the salsas etc. are all made really nicely."}
{"text":"More like 3.5.  I've tried and liked most of the Playa Cubana joints and this one is no exception. The food here is very good. The menu is simple, and I figured out after a few times what were my faves and their quality has been consistent. It's not cheap, for the amount that you get, but it's not outrageously expensive either. The drinks as with most places in the city will amount to half your bill, but I guess torontonians have become accustomed to this. The service is only okay.  All the times that I've been, they have been either very friendly but inefficient, or efficient but aloof.  One time my friend and I both took up a server's recommendation on a dish only to find out it's an appetizer when it came. We had obviously ordered it as entrees based on his description. When I pointed this out, he said yeah, it's more an app.  Huh? should we order more or just leave hungry? It was just odd."}
{"text":"We had pork carnitas (excellent) and lamb tacos (good). Solid service but felt overpriced and probably wont go back."}
{"text":"Had to leave a review both in here and Google! I came to Toronto from the States, and the Mexican cuisine there is amazing, but here I was pleasantly surprised as well! Fantastic food! What really put this place above the rest was the service though!  There was especially this skinny bus boy, believe named Jordan, that was absolutely amazing! He made us feel very welcome and gave us his full attention . It's amazing that he's not even a full server yet! I'd come back just for his service! Thanks for a great taste of Mexico in Toronto, and thank you for even better service Mr. Jordan! When people ask me about Toronto I'll definitely be recommended y'all for a visit!"}
{"text":"Tiny place with about 10 tables. Went in on a Thursday evening and it was busy. Service was good and the food even better. We were a big group so we got pretty much everything on the menu. The ceviche, shrimp and carnitas were delicious. I highly recommend this place. Drinks were a slight let down but great meal otherwise."}
{"text":"I had never been to any of the Playa Cabana family of restaurants. Which thinking about it, is very odd since I love tacos! Anyway, I had been doing research on new restaurants when I stumbled on this restaurant. What intrigued me the most when reading about Cocina Economica is that it was attempting to take a more simple and authentic approach to Mexican food and staying away from the gimmicks and \"twists.\" Rather than add a spin to an already delicious cuisine, they were going to try to keep it real - yeah, having a hard time explaining why I just had to check this place out . :)  On the restaurant's website you can make a reservation but you can't see the menu. The food menu is split into 4 sections:  Bocaditos (appetizers) Entradas (mains) Sides Dulces (desserts)  I had made a reservation for 6 and when we got there on a Friday night, the restaurant was packed! So much so that we were squeezed in a corner and lucky for us, and them, the 6th person cancelled at the last-minute because there was no room to fit a 6th body in the cramped corner we were in. Immediately after sitting down we were served fried tortillas and two salsas - one red, one green and neither was spicy. Soon after our waitress came by to take our order. Some of my friends decided to share appetizers, but I went straight to the main. Our order was:  Tinga tostada $12 (appetizer) Al Pastor $14 (main) Pescado en papelado $22 (main) Barbacoa $18 (main) Pastel Impossible $9 (dessert)  I ordered the Al Pastor and I LOVED it! It was marinated pork leg served right off the spit and it was served with rice, beans, tortillas and grilled pineapple. I specially loved how I asked for no onions and this request was made possible. I was in heaven. I grew up eating this food, so knowing that a restaurant in Toronto was making food that reminded me of the good moments growing up had me feeling ecstatic!  The rest of the table also enjoyed their meals and the only item that was not well-received was the caldo (soup) that came with the Barbacoa (lamb) - I am personally not a fan because I find it tastes greasy and gamy.  The Hiccups  Several people at our table had ordered Coronas (so cliche I know :)) and as more people arrived they also wanted Coronas and realized that rather than pay for them separately, you could get a bucket and it would be cheaper. So we asked our waitress for the bucket deal. She told us that it was too late because some people had already ordered some individually and the \"system\" could not be changed from singles to the bucket deal. Okay, we found that silly and bizarre. But after some back and forth she agreed to give us the price of the bucket.  Because our table was so small, there was no room to put all the tortillas for each of our mains, so our waitress told us that she was going to bring more out when we were done with the few we had been given - every single one of our dishes came with tortillas, but only got half the amount because of space on the table. We ran out of them pretty quickly and we couldn't find our waitress so we asked another staff for more tortillas and he told us that there would be an extra cost. I told him to please check with our waitress first because she owed us another batch. Then our waitress came over with the 2nd batch and we figured the issue had been addressed. When we got the bill we were charged for the 2nd round of tortillas ($3)! Argh! And they did not take it off the bill! So sad to see a good meal be tarnished by something that could have been very simply taken care of.  In sum, though there were some letdowns the food was delicious enough to warrant a second visit. And who knows, this is a new restaurant and new establishments should be allowed time to iron out their kinks. And let's be honest, they are not lacking business!"}
{"text":"Great little taco spot on the east end. Affordable prices and awesome food! The atmosphere is cozy with great decor.  Everything we had was delicious. The presentation of the food was also great. Tortillas came wrapped in a blanket in baskets, and the accompanying salsas and sauces were tasty.  The ceviche was a bit tangy for my liking but might've been a one-off and an extra squeeze of lime.  Prices were also cheaper in comparison to some other core downtown taco places which was a plus."}
{"text":"It was hard to tear myself away from the delicious food, but I had to write this:  Soy sausage (please excuse me, I'm going to call them platters) was spicy, savoury, and saucy. The rice and beans with the protein are plentiful and I love how they're laid out in the to-go container (bonus for reusability as it isn't Styrofoam).  Braised beef platter : same rice/beans with an amazing amount of tender, soft, juicy braised beef. The salsa verde was spicy and tangy and awesome.  The sauces were complimentary to the dishes. Cilantro cream, a lovely mole and a VERY spicy but delicious hot pepper sauce. Looks are deceiving but it was quelled by the rice. And the tortillas! Oh! They are cute and little, fresh and warm and made of corn! So yummy and authentic.  The staff were very nice, quick, accommodating, and great at making me feel welcome even just for take out. The margarita was sour and refreshing.  I'll be back because I want to try everything. Especially the dessert. Nice hours, cute place!"}
{"text":"La Cocina Economica Toronto's most authentic Mexican eats. Walking through the door and greeted by a huge smile and a welcome was La Cocina's manager Javier (, I think really our good time vibe was started here). Chef Samantha's perfectly seasoned fixin's waiting to be seized by your tortilla. Her incredible palate shines making each bite an adventure south full of taste and pleasure. Will I be back, unfortunately they are closed Sunday's, soooo, definitely on Monday. #toronto #mexican #cocinaeconomica #thumbsup #delicious"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!! Popped in here today for lunch. We had the whole place to ourselves because it was a Sunday and early. To begin with, the place is super cute! Absolutely love the decor. We started with the guacamole which was good. For my main, I had the beef brisket in salsa verde. It was flavourful and plentiful. I tried a bite of the carnitas too and it was so tasty. Will have that and the ceviche next time. Our server was so cute and very personable. I wish I could remember his name to give him a shout out because he was lovely. My lunch with one beer came to $35. I feel it was worth every penny. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Cozy spot for good Mexican. This place is pretty small with the ambience of a Mexican tavern touched by hipsters - lovely for a date or catching up with a friend. Two of us stopped by mid-week a half hour before closing for a late snack and we were surprised to see that it was still completely full. The staff were friendly and welcoming considering we got our tiny order in just before the kitchen closed. There were complimentary toasted tortillas with 3 different sauces!  We shared Guacamole con Tostada Horneada ($9), which came with large crispy, toasted tortillas to break apart and dip in a guacamole with queso fresco. We liked it so much we were eating the rest of it with spoons when we ran out of tortillas. Jamaica (Hibiscus flower juice) and Horchata (Rice milk with cinnamon) were refreshing and tasty as well. Would love to come back and try their full menu!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal. The pork belly, beef tip taco and the leg of pork dishes were delicious. Their hot sauce is really good too (habanero and tomatillo sauce). Had a white sangria but that needed some work, tasted more like grapefruit juice. I like the ambience, small and cozy and the decor is pretty cool."}
{"text":"HIGHLIGHTS  Cocina Economica is a hidden gem located on the east side of Toronto. It's a small but vibrant Mexican restaurant, part of Dave Sidhu's (famous Toronto Mexican restaurant owner) restaurant chain. The food was good but not mind blowing. It's worth coming here for the chill vibes, friendly service, and not-so-typical homestyle Mexican fare.   GOOD FOR: - Group of friends - Casual date - Patio  ATMOSPHERE (5/5) Hip, modern and colourfully decorate restaurant tucked away on a small street off Queen East. From afar, it resembles a shack - it's a lowkey restaurant that only local Torontonians would find.   FOOD (4/5) - The shrimp and scallop ceviche (4/5) was fresh and zingy, served on a large tortilla chip. Perfect for a starter. - Most of the main dishes are served in multiple components. You select a type of meat, and the accompanying sides come with it - fresh (warm) tortillas, salsa, vegetable toppings, etc. - DIY but that's part of the fun. I got the pork leg with pineapple (4/5) which was delicious. The pork leg is plated and comes slightly charred, and the pineapple makes for a great complement. The barbacoa (2.5/5) was just okay - wouldn't recommend.  - If you're a fan of chilis, ask for their hot sauce selection. Excellent variety of fresh chilis from a range of mild to impossibly hot.   PORTION SIZES Hungry: ordering a main dish + sharing 1 appetizer is the perfect amount of food.  Moderately hungry: just a main dish is more than enough. Not-so-hungry: consider ordering just an appetizer.  DRINKS - Ordered the red sangria and white sangria - both were nice and refreshing.  SERVICE (5/5) - The waiter was down to earth and always refilled water promptly.   OVERALL (4/5) Would recommend? Yes Would come back? Yes What would I try next time? Guacamole, braised beef shoulder, lamb, dulce de leche  What would I order again? Ceviche"}
{"text":"Very tasty food for a good value. The portions were perfect.  I've been here twice already since it's so close to work. First I had the cerviche with Raw shrimp and scallop which was tasty. The only disappointment was the inconsistency of this dish over the week.  I has ordered this dish a week earlier and had lots of seafood.  The second time part of it was substituted with guacamole.  It still tasted great but I would be expecting the same dish to be identical over just one week.  I'm not sure if they are cutting costs with lesser seafood or whether they forgot guacamole the first time. For the main  I've had Al pastor, which is pork and was okay for me a little dry. My favorite so far is the chicken. It is so tender with this amazing red sauce. I would skip the beef shoulder.  I would definitely come back as I already have !"}
{"text":"I walk by this place every day (I work next door) and didn't know it was a restaurant at first. It's one of those hole in the wall places you always hear about. One of my colleagues told me it was authentic Mexican and I was instantly salivating. We finally came here on our lunch break a couple weeks ago and I was not disappointed! Mexican food has always been my favourite, but I didn't really know Mexican until I visited Cocina Economica.   The food here is delicious! The service was amazing! I had the Barbacoa.  I'm already thinking about my next visit. Hopefully after work this time so we can indulge in some drinks :)"}
{"text":"One of my most favourite meals in a long time. Plus, we had guac, a pitcher of margaritas, two mains and two desserts and it came to less than $130 total. The ambience is exactly what you want in a cozy night out. No fuss but high quality. Will be back many, many times!"}
{"text":"Finally some great authentic Mexican food outside of the states! It's this great little hole in the wall outside of downtown. My friend and I split the barbacoa and it was really tasty. Probably the most memorable part was our conversation with our waiter. He was really helpful and we had a blast talking about differences between Florida and Canada."}
{"text":"My dinner upset my stomach. This is thanks to the almost cold dinner I had at Cocina Economica. Despite other reviews I read, my experience tonight was very disappointing. Highlights: - poor portions that contained 50% fat and bone in the meal - small drink for a high price  - long wait time for our dinner which arrived in stages and was not hot - a policy not to do separate bills - an automatic addition of 18% for a group - bland disappointing dishes - Surprises on the bill (nickel and diming over what comes with your meal and what is extra)  The Margarita on various pages I previously saw was in a margarita glass and looked great. What I actually got was small and disappointing. Not even in a proper glass. $12 for a tiny  drink. I asked the waiter for a proper glass and to his credit, he corrected it but it is disappointing it was necessary to do so. The portion was pretty small compared to other Margaritas I have had.  The beans and rice were not served on our main plate as pictured in other reviews. They arrived on small plates with tiny portions and they were cold. Not appetizing or inspiring. I could have gotten better out of a tin from the grocery store.   My main was Res En Salsa Verde (Braised Beef) $15. It looks NOTHING like what other reviewer's pictures have been. Luke warm, full of fat and bone. Bland. The server asked how our meals were and I let him know it was bland and fatty. He just said sorry and that it was supposed to be like that. What is the point of asking if you don't take corrective action?  Others ordered the Barbacoa (Lamb) $18 and the Shrimp $?. The Shrimp got a good review. The Barbacoa was okay but not spicy. Unfortunately, an order of guacamole was ordered $9. Small portions and bland. Overall it was felt we could have done better at a fast food burrito place. Wow. That doesn't say much to me. What happened to all the good experiences I read about and some saying it was like home cooking they remember in Mexico? This was not my experience.   I might have given a slightly higher review but then came the bill. The server indicated they don't split the bill and then agreed to split it among the couples at the table. That turned out badly. People who did not drink and had a small order were given $80 bills and those who did drink and ordered appetizers got the lowest. He claimed all the bills were split evenly but they weren't so we asked for one bill and worked to figure out what we each owed ourselves. That took a long time and ruined the meal.   We also discovered extra charges for the tortillas even through we had a large table and there was only enough for six of us. He earlier indicated that each meal would come with the tortillas. There were 4 containers and 8 people so seems to me someone didn't get theirs. We had to share and then get charged for extra when we never got what we already paid for. I noticed this occurred in another review and I can confirm this happened again to us.   Sadly, I cannot recommend this place in good conscience. The interior is nice and the staff are generally friendly. I really wish I could have given a better review.   Now I await my stomach ache from cold fatty food to settle down.  Update:  I reached out to the restaurant to share my concerns about my experience.  To date, my concerns have gone ignored.  They don't respond to customers.  So much for customer service."}
{"text":"It was definitely a package of Mexican experience. Great food, service and atmosphere. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic Mexican food this is the place to go. Really good margaritas. It's a small cozy place but they will do their best to accommodate you even on a very busy night. Their tres leche for dessert is to die for!"}
{"text":"Great date spot, staff are awesome, food delicious. I would recommend to locals. People driving in and not familiar with the area should park close to the restaurant"}
{"text":"Small funky place on little Berkley St. Food was delicous and filling. As a free starter they give u tortillas with 5 sauces mild to burn"}
{"text":"This is an amazing little restaurant with some of the best Mexican food I've had in a very long time. We started with a mescal and guacamole which was terrific. (If you want to go cheap pass on the mescal.) The food was amazing. My wife's tinga tostadas were wonderful, and my tscos al pastor made me think I was back in Jalisco. OK, so the service was not good - it was enthusiastic - everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves and loving the place. Kate and Javier who I think own the place are grand folks, and I hope they do as well as they should. I will be back, and you must go."}
{"text":"Yummy snacks (3 choices of salsa) great patio and the Mojitos get a thumbs up! I had the pork and wasn't too impressed, my partners chicken dish was better. Good addition to the Corktown"}
{"text":"Tucked away is this cozy place with amazing tacos and fresh Mexican food!  //THE FOOD// CEVICHE CAMPECHANO (4/5)- I thought the raw shrimp and scallops was very refreshing and citrusy GUACAMOLE CON TOSTADA HORNEADA (3/5) - Pretty standard in my opinion! CARNITAS (3.5/5) - the pork belly and ribs meat was pulled apart and plentiful. It was juicy and flavourful.  CAMARONES AL GUAJILLO (5/5) - hands down would order this again and again! The shrimp (~8 of them) were huge and juicy. The shrimp were soaked in a plate overflowing with its broth that was deliciously savoury. I even made sure not one drop went to waste by soaking up the extra with tortillas!  Overall the Carnitas & Camarones al Guajillo taco dishes came with awesome rice, pinto beans, salsa, and corn tortillas (came out warm in a little basket). I did find there wasn't enough tortillas for the fillings/entree so I had to request for more (no extra charge!)."}
{"text":"2.5 - I do like the decor! Decor is Busy, detailed and rustic looking, transports you elsewhere.  Friendly staff. Interesting concept when they describe it but really its just make your own tacos.  Tastey but nothing really stood out to me. Weird how they give you such minimal amounts of rice and beans. Nice soft taco but I rather have the dish (I had the shrimp and my bf had the lamb) with just the sauce mixed with rice and beans. We did ask for more rice. Minimal cilantro. A bit confused when they brought out the hard tacos and hot sauces. Was it an app or was it to go with our dish? We did both.   Since it is make your own tacos we had sooo many dishes on the table. The tables are super duper small - we had to put some dishes and the water bottle on other surrounding tables (I cannot imagine where to put stuff if the resto was packed).   A bit more $ than you expect to DIY your own tacos, unless you like paying for that experience."}
{"text":"Delicious tortillas and guac. We also enjoyed the vegetarian tacos. One of our new favourite restaurants in Toronto, if not #1! The rice, beans were very tasty. Also they gave us 4 different salsas with the tacos. The tortillas were so fresh and warm. We'd highly recommend this place!"}
