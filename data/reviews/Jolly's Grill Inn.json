{"text":"This place used to be Coffee In. I really like this filipino restaurant because of the variety of food they offer, prices are better than Remely's, Jesse Junior, and the other nearby restaurant at Lawrence and Pharmacy. I often get isaw (Very popular street food dipped in vinegar), bitso bitso (dessert), bopiece, Lanka, and bicol express. A few dishes are not as good as my parents' home cooked meals but they're still pretty good!"}
{"text":"- am new to filipino food - but this was amazing! - cafeteria style with trays and trays of food all prepared for your enjoyment - if i recall it was rice + 2 sides + pop for 7.99 and 6.99 for the 1 side option - try the mung bean stew. try the bbq. try it all."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents one afternoon to grab some late lunch and instead was taken aback by the tasteless BBQ and overly dry rice. My mom ordered the sinigang which in my honest opinion - my mom could make better and didn't make sense why we went there to pay for things we could make ourselves but with taste...  Anyway, I wouldn't suggest this place even if it was the only place open during a stat holiday.. Instead I would recommend LJ Kusina and order this place to be shut down due to un-appealingness =c"}
{"text":"This spot is your average filipino take-out place with a small seating area but with less attitude than the ones in Mississauga.  It is a turo-turo (point at your food) style restaurant.  They serve a variety of stew dishes as well as bituka which they make themselves (a definite plus).  Bituka is pork intestine chicharon, for those who do not know and they are a filipino delicacy.   You can buy them in an asian grocery pre-packaged, but that does not compare to a fresh batch made at a restaurant.  They have a sit-in area where you can watch the filipino shows they have on.  You will find the patrons enjoying their stay here, eating the food provided and engaging with the show on tv, even laughing with the show.   (Happyy ambiance anyone?)  They also serve barbeque sticks which I think is fairly decent sized.  Once you're done with your meal, you can pick up some filipino newspapers on your way out, so you know what's up with the filipino stars and President Duterte."}
{"text":"I came to explore what/how Jolly Grill'd. Nothing from afar gave any indication. I ran thru few possible Grill options in my head. None of which told me this was Filipino. Until I had one foot in the door...  Firstly  -  Lunch counter setup. Secondly  -  Filipino staff.   Thirdly  -  Filipino customers. Fourthly  -  CP24 on LCD. Fifthly  -  Organize/New space.  Bingo!  Notice small shop had younger enthusiastic staff. Friendly and helpful with Combo selection. Sauces/Seasoning available self-serve.  Combo 3(1 Rice + 2 Dishes + 1 Pop $6.49) Pork w/Coconut Milk & Hot Peppers (Kinukot?) Bittermelon w/String Beans, Okra (Pinakbet?) Steam Plain White Rice (sat too long)  Apparently I overheard about some Fried Chicken positive comments. Toonie Tuesday & Wednesday(1 Rice + 1 Chicken $2.00) There's a small-ish dine-in fee which I forgot the amount. Not bad overall experience of Filipino cuisine realm I've ventured thus far."}
{"text":"Food so salty especially their sinagang .. their breakfast combos are better .. I like their longsilog .. service is nice .. coffee in at birchmount and lawrence is much better and better selection .."}
{"text":"Tried their food after not dropping in in months to try and recall how the food was.  2 item combo with rice and pop is now $8.50 but that's inflation for you. On the menu they list fried chicken and rice for $5.50 with a sign that says Wednesday Toonies $2.99 below it.  As it was Wednesday, I didn't want to pass on a good deal and yummy gravy so I bought that too.   Final thoughts: - gravy was the same - yummy and rich - a little like kfc but not as salty  - fried chicken was crunchy but not much flavour outside of your regular salt and pepper Wednesday Toonies special was NOT $2.99 as apparently that's for students only even though serving  is the same which I didn't find out until we had finished eating and noticed our bill.  No signs on the menu stated there was an age limit to the price :s - pork blood stew was good flavored but not much meat there - it was mostly fat and a little heavy on the vinegar which I personally didn't mind but my companion did - pork in coconut sauce was decent.  I think if you're going to advertise an item as a \"Wednesday Toonies\", you shouldn't have a limit on the age of who buys it especially if serving size is the same. Otherwise, call it the student Wednesday Toonie special. Whatever. Anyway, for the gravy alone, I'd come back just because it brings back memories for me... everything else... meh"}
{"text":"Everytime we visit in scarborough, we always drop-by in jolly's grill. Foods are great. But one of the server is soooo rude. Poor customer service and she dont even smile. I was ordering and she answered me with no manners. They do not have name tags, but i remember her hair is a little bit short above shoulders. The other lady who is always in the cashier and serving customers(wearing a ponytail)is very kind and accommodating."}
{"text":"Nice, clean eat-in or take-out place. Reasonably priced, delicious food items.  Went in the other day and had the bbq pork skewers (smoky and delish)."}
