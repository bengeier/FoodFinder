{"text":"Would go 3.5 stars but oh well. The place is pretty small but that is okay because it is not very populated. It has a very casual, quiet atmosphere perfect for studying. However, the menu selection was just as small as the restaurant. Which, doesn't always matter as long as what you do, you do well. I ordered the vegetable pho with tofu however only received 3 strips tofu. Aside from this, the pho was perfect and enough for a whole other meal tomorrow. Will come back!"}
{"text":"cho√¨ces are limited. What u can only eat is their soup noodles. General Tao 's chicken is the worst one I ever had. Curry chicken and curry shrimp are good. However, the container for take out is plastic and u can not microwave them!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome Vietnamese food. The price is good and foods are delicious. A good place to have group hang out. Definitely will come back next time with my friends. I got spicy fish noodle, it tasted good and I really like the fried tofu skin. My friends got fresh spring roll, it was good with peanut source. And the spicy kimchi seafood noodle soups is good for Asian flavor."}
{"text":"My friend was in the mood for pho and I had never been here before, so we came here. The posters on their door was written in Chinese.  Food: we shared the spring roll. They were huge. Too much vermicelli and the wrap made them flavorless. The sauce was just okay. I had pho with slice of beef, beef tripes, and etc. The portion was good, but the taste wasn't. There was nothing I enjoyed.   I would rather to have a hoagie or some Indian food from across the street."}
{"text":"I came in with my dad for dinner on a Friday night and it was pretty full. The restaurant is pretty small, and it has a nice, cozy feel to it. The staff were really friendly and attentive. Although the name suggests a Vietnamese place, Miss Saigon also offers Chinese food (and is owned by Chinese).  My dad ordered the pho tai and I got the grilled chicken bun vermicelli bowl, which came with a summer roll. My dad was a bit disappointed by the dish of fixings for his pho (basil, bean sprouts, etc.) because it was smaller than what other pho places give. However, we both enjoyed our food very much."}
{"text":"Their servers are terrible. When I was eating my Pad Thai, there were two little bugs flying around me, which were really annoying. I told them, but they did nothing to improve my experience, no seat change, no shooing off bugs. I don't know what they are doing at that time. It seems that they keep talking with some customers who they know about. Everything is slow in this restaurant. Their food is just average. I will never come again."}
{"text":"I went here many times. Very nice little place. Friendly staff, great food. I tried fresh rolls, chicken pho and spicy squid. I was happy with quality of food every time. I did take out few times. Staff does a good job of packing up everything you would need."}
{"text":"Ambiance is nice. Food was decent. The pho was probably 3/5 stars. Broth lacked flavor. But the pad Thai and vermicelli was pretty good."}
{"text":"I am so glad that Miss Saigon reopen. very good asian food!! I like the new spicy beef noodles soup veryyyy much!!! I will try the fish next time!!"}
{"text":"Had the grilled chicken bun vermicelli bowl and can Rangoon. Not bad, but limited selection....  Fish sauce wasn't too good"}
{"text":"Wow. This place tries hard, but is not good. The server was really nice and enthusiastic about the menu, but the food was not impressive at all.   We got the Miss Saigon Fried Rice. I don't know why they put artificial crab with the chicken and pork already in the dish. Quite odd, and overall a bit too salty. I feel like I make better fried rice than they do. We also got a pork banh mi. This was the best dish we got and pretty good. We also tried the fried ice cream. It was oddly not hot! The batter was fried, but room temperature. At the same time, the ice cream was melting quickly. They gave us forks to eat it with and we had to request spoons because it melted so quickly.   There are so many other food choices in the area. Even though I liked the banh mi, I do not plan to come back to this place."}
{"text":"This is a new place which is opened several months ago. The noodles here are quite good, especially for those who like spicy noodles. Service is great!"}
{"text":"So it appears the old owner reopened this place. Nothing's really changed regarding the vietnamese and thai menu, and you basically get what you paid for - ok food. I do miss the old kanda house tho! they used to offer some off-the-menu dishes that were really good."}
{"text":"Pretty good, reasonably priced Vietnamese food. We got the fried chicken dumplings, fresh rolls, tom yum with shrimp, veggie pho, and the lemongrass chicken bun. Overall, everything was very tasty, and provided a decent amount of food for the price (we went home with one small container of leftovers between three people, though we've left some other local Vietnamese restaurants with far more in the way of leftovers). Good, not great, but solid for the price. I recommend it if you're in the area. I will probably go back if I'm in the neighborhood and have a hankering for Vietnamese."}
{"text":"It is a nice place with nice Chinese and Thai food. But the species of food are not that rich. You don't usually have many options."}
{"text":"The veg pho here is one the best veg dishes I have had in Pittsburgh. Its sauces are excellent and the flavors come out very well."}
{"text":"Wow this place keeps changing its name.  Back in 2013, this was an awesome spot!  Then they sold and the name changed to Kanda House, but had the same menu.  They nearly killed me.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/kanda-house-pittsburgh-2  Looks like the new owners changed the name BACK to Miss Saigon 88, or maybe they just don't want to invest in a new awning"}
{"text":"Being new to Pittsburgh I have been somewhat underwhelmed by the choices in Vietnamese Pho restaurants. However, I ordered Pho today from Miss Saigon 88 from a local delivery service, and boy am I glad I haven't given up yet. The Pho is phenomenal! I ordered extra spicy and was pleasantly surprised by how high they turned the heat up for me. Is the broth the best ever? Probably not, but its good and hits the spot. Of the several other places I have tried, this one takes the cake! I do wish for a bit more cilantro next time and a couple limes versus the mealy one I received, but I'll just ask.  also, the spring rolls were not very good I will hold off on those too. But overall not too shabby! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If you've never had pho before, this is the perfect place to try it for the first time. With surprising classy decor for the area, it not only feels nice to eat at, but it also has a simplified pho menu that's easy to order off of for beginners.   The pho broth has great taste and it comes with all of the condiments that I expect a good pho place to have: basil, jalapenos, bean sprouts, and lime. (Seriously, idk why but some of the places in Pittsburgh don't give you everything...) While they don't give you a dipping plate for the side (my friend taught me to put my hoison and sriracha sauces on the side and dip into them), you can ask for one if you'd like.  Keep in mind, I'm not saying this is the end all be all for pho places, but it is very good with a great price if you're new to trying Vietnamese food.  I've also had their spring rolls which were enjoyable, but I mainly get the Vegetable pho. I'm adding this to my list of Oakland lunch spots, but do keep in mind that at Craig and Center, it's a bit of a hike!  Anyway, tl;dr great place to try pho for the first time (idk why I said that bc this review really isn't that long...)"}
{"text":"My review is biased because of my mom.   She spends 6 hours to 2 days on her pho, using real bones and bone marrows to create the broth from scratch. When made this way, a layer of fat should be floating at the top of the broth--to indicate the bones that were simmered. Also she makes it with oxtail in addition to the rare beef.  It's quite obvious for me, an experienced Phodie, that their pho is mediocre.  I ordered the Pho Tai. A simple bowl of rice noodles and rare beef.   The broth wasn't hot enough to soften the bean sprouts. The rice noodles were undercooked. The broth was clearly from bouillon cubes. And there wasn't enough beef.  At $7 it's a desperate substitute for real pho.   However I'm a fan of Thai food, so I may come back to try that side of their menu.  P.s. Bobas should only be bought from a place that only sells boba."}
{"text":"The waitress told us the food was coming soon but we wait for a long time. Finally we did not even eat the food. Thumb down"}
{"text":"For a pho restaurant the pho isn't anything amazing. My friend and I had the pho dac biet and it was ok. The broth had decent flavor and there was a good amount of noodles but it lacked a fair amount of sliced beef and the meat balls were the same.   For an appetizer we had the Thai chicken wings and they were good. Big wings, but a bit too sweet for my personal taste. Heavy on the garlic and onions in the sauce.   Another friend had a green curry and it was quite good, probably the best dish out of the three we had.   Overall, I will come back and try another dish. I gave it three stars because I think the pho is just ok. Service is good and prices are fair."}
{"text":"This was decent food in generous portions at college student prices. So based on a $8 charge for a large noodle bowl this is 4 stars.  The menu is very limited but I would go back here for a casual and inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"decided to try while in town visiting friends.  Food was very authentic and fresh. I really enjoyed the generals chicken, fresh spring (or summer) rolls, & chrysanthemum tea.  Menu isn't huge. Lots of chicken, seafood, pork, & tofu; not much beef.  My local friends said they would go back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend. I read in other reviews that the pho is subpar so I went instead with the chicken vermicilli bowl. It was pretty tasty, though nothing extra-ordinary. My friend ordered chicken coconut curry and was happy with her meal. Again, nothing special but if you're hungry it more than does the trick.  The waitress was polite and efficient, and didn't offer the check until we asked for it which was oddly refreshing. All in all, a decent lunch place. Can't speak for the pho but the noodle bowls are solid."}
{"text":"The restaurant was really hot. There was no air conditioning, and only two fans circulating the stuffy air. As for the food, I ordered the Pho Tai ($8 pho with sliced beef). The bowl was very large, filled mostly with broth; there wasn't much b√°nh pho or beef. The broth was very concentrated, suggesting that they spent a long time to make. However, it was a bit salty. I've had better, but this place wasn't bad."}
