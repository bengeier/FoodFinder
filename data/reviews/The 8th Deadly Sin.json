{"text":"Suspicious, or what?. Either written by the owner, although she does have other reviews displayed or she must have been offered a perk to write. Offering every type of food a person could wish to order, indeed. I don't believe a word of this, and I should think few would."}
{"text":"$5 pints all day!!! This probably won't last forever, so this alone is reason to check this place out. I had the Beau's, which was fantastic as always.  This restaurant is the old Fire on the East Side and, from what I understand, was just closed down for about a week to update its look.  The menu is new, and I had the Angus burger, which was very tender and juicy. The fries were also very good. My friends had a variety of other dishes, and everyone was impressed.  I like the atmosphere here: it is one of those great relaxed and modern rooms with a patio that are far enough from Yonge to be quiet but close enough that it's convenient. Great, friendly vibes. The service was great as well.  All in all, this is a very solid choice for lunch or dinner, or just drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing spot! I met my two girlfriends for Saturday brunch and we had a great time. The prices were reasonable (although, $3 coffee? Really?), service was friendly and portions were fair. None of us ordered a daily special but they both sounded pretty appetizing and the general menu offered a variety of breakfast and lunch-ish options.  This place is also popular for their cocktails (Caesars especially) and although we didn't order one, they looked delicious. I'd definitely try them out for dinner next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I was sad when I thought that Fire on the East Side had closed down. I was happy to note that they just rebranded themselves to The 8th Deadly Sin, and did some changes to the menu and d√©cor. I got my usual the Salmon Benny, just to make sure that it was still as good as I remember it. The eggs were poached perfectly. The hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy, and I enjoyed the crunch on the English muffin. I also loved the banana bread they served us. It was moist; the banana flavor came through, and it wasn't too heavy. Our waitress was friendly. She was new and came to check on us a few times to make sure that we had coffee refills and were ok.  Only complaint was that we were seated close to the entrance, which was a bit cold."}
{"text":"Sunday, April 13th @ 11 am for brunch--Disappointed. Will not come back. Brunch service was SLOW. As in waited-17-min-before-asked-if-I'd-like-something-to-drink slow! It also took a really long time for our food to come. When it arrived, the roasted duck hash I ordered had no flavour other than SPICY! Too spicy by far. Maybe Tabasco sauce is the only \"spice\" they have in the kitchen.  Oh, and my poached eggs were over-cooked. :-( With so many awesome brunch places in the city, this will not be one I go back to."}
{"text":"Came here about a month ago, as I was a huge fan of Fire on the East Side and heard it was the same owner so went with high hopes. I was a little underwhelmed on the results but was still okay with the experience.  The dinner menu was a much smaller menu, literally only a handful of main options (butter chicken quesedilla, fried chicken, steak frites, salmon w/ quinoa salad, and I think something else). The food was good, but was mostly impressed by the apps (mac and cheese balls and some sort of daily special bread thing) as the fried chicken seemed fatty and not that satisfying on fork and knife appeal.  Pints were only $5 with a decent selection, and wine seemed rather affordable too. We got a bottle of wine, a few apps, 2 mains, and a pint of beer for a very impressive price. I just wish the menu was wider in selection."}
{"text":"I love 8th Deadly Sin! The interesting beer selection is amazing and they're all $5 a pint! The food menu could be bigger but I understand people go there just to have a beer and dance. The nachos were the best bar nachos I've ever had though, not greasy or gross, just perfect. There's more than 1 dance area too. The decor downstairs is really groovy. My friend is planning on throwing her birthday party there in September (they do parties!). Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of dining area! This place definitely has a relaxed chill vibe until the revolving door of people walk through another door.  The server we had today was awesome.   We came for brunch. I ordered the quiche of the day which came with peppers, cheddar cheese and i think, mushrooms. Served with mixed green salad and rather cold potatoes.    To be honest, I was disappointed. The chilly potatoes surprised me and the quiche was not quite abysmal. It bothers me that I cannot remember any flavour to it. I love quiche - and it fell flat on any depth of flavour. The crust was overdone which may have contributed to its rather dry taste. Such a small slice for a really big plate.   I will say the coffee was alright.  But what was unusual and a little off putting was the door that had a bunch of people going in and out of it. As I read another persons review I realized it was a club. I really wish they had a different entrance for that part of their business. It's odd to dine and having people coming and going.  Maybe it saves money but I think if they want to establish themselves in dining they might just need to make a separate entrance.  ***Please note: washroom here is not the best. it maybe because it serves a club establishment. the ladies washroom has this purple-red glow light action whereas the men - normal lighting. Why?  And yes, I did creep over and check but I thought the lighting was weird.  Aside from the lighting, the smell was awful and it was not clean.  One of us was terribly unlucky and was walking into a \"sticky\" stall.    I can't say I would go here again for food."}
{"text":"Note: 8th Deadly Sin is a re-brand of the former Fire on the East Side restaurant at this location. On a trip for brunch this weekend, I asked our server about the change -- same owners, but they did some renos to the interior and changed the menu.  Well, the menu looks pretty similar to me. Still have the Healthy Scramble, the Crab Cakes Benny, Smoked Salmon Benny I remember from Fire on the East Side.   I like this location (easy walking distance from Bloor-Yonge or Wellesley stations), plus they take reservations for Saturday and Sunday brunch, which can be a rarity in this city."}
{"text":"I was wandering around Church-Wellesly looking for somewhere to have a quiet drink when I spied fairy lights up from the corner of Gloucester St and went to explore. What I found was an intimate, cozy and newly opened bar called The 8th Deadly Sin. Once inside I was immediately greeted with a friendly server who brought my friend and I water and menus. Going well so far!  The menu was surprisingly eclectic and reasonably priced. A diverse selection of decently priced beers on draft and in the bottle, wine and cocktails between $8 and $10. The food menu had everything you could possibly desire to eat including nachos, poutine, salad, kettle chips, eggs, quesadillas etc. I ordered a pumpkin ale and the nightly dessert which was a toasted marshmallow and bourbon cheesecake. Both were delicious and the server was kind enough to provide a generous sample of the beer before we ordered it ($6 for a giant glass).  After 10pm we noticed (due to the introduction of blasting Katy Perry, blue strobe lights and smoke machines) that there was a nightclub attached. What followed was a continual stream of gay men going in and out and we began to wonder, is this actually a gay bar? The new business entry on Yelp failed to specify. When I ventured downstairs to the washroom I found there was an additional bar downstairs that also had a predominantly gay crowd.  The target clientele of the bar is yet to be determined but it is located in the village. The nightclub aspect does interrupt the ambience of the upstairs bar irregardless because of the entryway being common and the loud music. The server advised us that they also do brunch on the weekends so I might come back for that. They have a good selection of cheap food, a great beer selection and friendly staff...I'm pretty sure anyone could find something to eat here. Worth trying."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing, friendly, and open-armed. And the food is quite scrumptious. STRONGLY recommend the Crab-Cake Benedict.  The decor and ambience is quite comfy, and it feels like a place you can take anyone, or even go alone and feel completely welcome."}
{"text":"A Texan loving it here already. Reasonably priced drinks (martinis!!) and yummy snacks like LOBSTER POUTINE. We abandoned the BarVolo idea when we arrived there and found this much less crowded, cute adorable place!!! And not 25$ a drink.. BarVolo is a bit over rated."}
{"text":"I can't believe Fire on The East Side closed down, but this place is pretty cool! Definitely even cozier than before and a bit more hipster.  Went here after work on a Thursday. Lots of cool craft beers on tap and by the bottle. Very good prices on booze, including $3 vodka shots every weekday, so could potentially get slightly dangereux. $5 pints too.   The food menu looked great but we didn't try anything. Will have to report back on that."}
