{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this place. Hot dogs have good snap (though not as good as Red Caboose) and they're usually cooked well. Fries are good. Never soggy and have a decent crisp to them and they don't taste freezer burned, which is very important to me.  I would recommend this place if the Red Caboose is out of your way. They've got a good shop here.  Update: They've now got one major advantage over Red Caboose, and that is they now serve some great corndogs!"}
{"text":"First off, upon entry, I was taken by how very neat and clean the place is.  I hope they keep this up.  Items sampled included their Chili Dog, Cheese Dog, Bacon Cheese Burger, Fries, and a Super Pretzel with Cheese.  The dogs were good.  Nothing spectacular, or \"different\" from any place that served \"a good dog\".  Some of our buns were --slightly-- stale, but other than that, there was no issue with them.  There was a quaint little toppings bar that consisted of mayo, pickles, relish, onions, hot sauce, ketchup, mustard, and brown mustard.  The burger was good, too.  I was pleased with the size and the seasoning on it.  The fries were good.  They are fresh cut, are given in a good amount, and were crispy and NOT greasy.  The only thing I wish they had was some seasoning on them.  Hoping in the future they can include something other than just salt and pepper on their little toppings bar, like a seasoning salt or something like that.  All in all, if I were to be in the area again, and were in the mood for a burger or dog, I would stop here.  Fair prices, and good portions."}
{"text":"Really good burgers, super nice people. The hot dogs are nothing to write home about....they're just hot dogs. Not much you can do about it. Fries are excellent...they remind me of potato patch fries at Kennywood when you order them with cheese. The burgers taste good. There is a very simple generic condiment stand, and you can't order burgers with anything but cheese.  I would not recommend the grilled ham and cheese if you are hungry because it is very. VERY. Small. Two pieces of white bread, one slice of cheese and one thin slice of deli shaved ham. It was more like a kids meal. I could have ate 4 of them at least.  Nothing tasted bad at all, it is a nice clean place and brand new. It's worth a stop for quick, cheaper priced food."}
