{"text":"Two scoops of octopus mixed with white rice, cucumber, cabbage and sweet onion, topped with Kona Ponzu sauce then finished with crab, avocado, and green onions - and finally drizzled with spicy mayo.  This is simply divine!  Fresh, light and packed full of flavours that grab your palates attention with each adventurous mouthful.  I cannot recommend this place enough.  Get there early as the line up was well out the door and around the corner by 11:30!  Service was quick and friendly, a nice mix of high energy and professionalism.  Recommendations were provided for what would go well with my protein choice.  I left with the feeling that my request for my meal to not be too spicy was fulfilled perfectly and the taste is in the bowl.  Price point is reasonable given the fresh ingredients which includes the freshest fish!  I will bring friends with me next time!"}
{"text":"I spotted Kona Poke on Instagram and ran right over for lunch today. It was 100% worth the wait! Their prices are pretty reasonable for portion size, especially since you can get scoops of any of their poke proteins for no extra charge (other places charge more for Ahi tuna etc.) For the same price as a single sushi roll elsewhere (Kabuku/Zen 8/Ki etc.), I had a bowl packed with veggies, rice, ahi tuna and salmon and any toppings I wanted. Everything was super fresh which you can't help but appreciate when you take a gamble on raw fish in the prairies. I really liked that you can customize your poke sauce & you're not limited to just one base or type of protein, so every time you go back you could easily eat a completely different meal.   The staff were super friendly and totally on their game - it wasn't like other +15 grab and go restaurants at all. I asked for recommendations and got genuine answers from the staff that didn't disappoint at all.   Kona Poke is a standout addition to the downtown lunch scene. I can't say enough good things about this place and I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Their branding, location, and food are ALL amazing!!!! DEFINITELY check out this spot if you want something fresh and tasty. A highlight on the +15 forsure!! It's totally worth the wait.  The staff are also wonderful! So friendly and they look happy, excited and full of energy! It's a fun place to be!!!  Especially to break up a long, hectic work day.  I'll forsure be back forsure."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and unfortunately I must say the food is overpriced and the portions are ridiculously small. You'll be lucky if you get two full scoops of protein. Toppings are limited and they barely give any. I always leave with my bowl half empty. Someone needs to talk to management about how stinginess does not bring back customers!   Do not recommend ..."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite place. A bowl of your selection of fish(salmon, tuna, spicy poke-tuna in a spicy mayo sauce), octopus or tofu in two sizes. Dress up your bowl with a variety of add ons.  The regular comes out to 12 bucks and its totally worth it.  Add avacado, crab or a second scoop of poke and added $2 per option.   Great options, fast service and bright refreshing flavour. Super helpful staff.   Pro tip: cut the lava sauce with the ponzu- the lava sauce is lava- super intense and spicy."}
{"text":"I love social media, especially when it helps me find gems like this place!  Intel from other Yelpers, I knew to get here early. I was already 3rd in line when I arrived shortly before 11AM. As soon as the gates opened up, the line was at least 20 people deep down the +15!  Although the poke bowl assembly line was pretty efficient, those new or unsure about what they want (you can spot these people gazing & looking lost at all the options) really hold up the line, unfortunately.   For $10.50 for a regular bowl, you get the option of your base (rice, greens or tortillas), 2 scoops of protein (tuna, salmon, octopus or vegan), sides (variety of veggies), sauces and toppings.   I went with a mix of ahi tuna & salmon in spicy mayo, side of crab & avocado (these were an additional $2) on brown rice. Everything was really fresh, the down side is that you can't really mix your bowl or else you'll cook the fish (and any of the veg) in the steaming hot rice.   I enjoyed my poke bowl, and since I didn't really have to wait very long (aside from the indecisive people ahead of me in line), obviously I thought it was worth the wait. I'm not sure if I'd say the same if I had been 10th or 20th in line.   If you get hangry like I do, maybe let the hype die down before venturing over. Or go super early like I did :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and there was a line up but it moved quickly. I had the regular Ahi Tuna and Salmon with maple Miso. It was really good. The fish was good and  there was enough variety. Only complaint was the interac kept coming out so it took awhile to pay but I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We arrived on a weekday at 1230 and the ahi tuna, octopus and salmon were all sold out. Remaining was the spicy mix (salmon and longfin tuna). I won't even mention the vegan mix as the basis for poke is ahi tuna. The line was long but went fairly quickly (10-15 min) and the service was super friendly. They gave us samples of kombucha while waiting in line.   Now the only comparison I have is to the many many bowls of poke that I have eaten in Hawaii.   We each got a large bowl. The bowl was 3/4 rice and you get 3 scoops of fish selection. I went with the spicy mix. The scoops are tiny ice cream scoopers and frankly I think they are very stingy on the protein. In Hawaii the bowl is over flowing with tuna. I understand that the fish is not as plentiful in AB but for the price you should be getting your money's worth. I didn't like the salad options to throw on the top...I think that's just filler. I have never seen lettuce, cabbage, cukes, or jalapenos on my poke bowls in Hawaii. They made you pay an extra 2$ for a tiny ice cream scooper of avocado which just jacks up the price.   The spicy sauce was delicious and there was no fishy or weird aftertaste from the fish so it tasted fairly fresh.   All is all, the bowl was pretty tasty and I didn't bother with any of the fillers. I think I'll try the other poke place and hope it's more like Hawaii."}
{"text":"Stopped by at 120 pm on a Thursday to enjoy some Poke only to find out they are closed.  Won't be coming here again.  If you can't stay open for a 3 hour lunch window, your business plan is flawed. Sorry"}
{"text":"Going with the poke trend, I decided to check out this spot in downtown Calgary for a late after-work lunch!  I've really enjoyed my experience at other poke restaurants and was really looking forward to a deliciously satisfying and fresh Hawaiian bowl.  Atmosphere: 4/5  neat and clean, modern and bright spot; parking was easy to find considering it is in downtown Calgary.  There were only a few tables but as with most poke places, the majority of customers tend to do take out.  Thankfully, I came for a late enough lunch that there was no line up either!  Food: 3/5  I had the regular size salmon and ahi tuna on mixed greens and brown rice.  The portion size was smaller than expected, and there were not as many sides and toppings as with other locations.  For example, I was really looking forward to seaweed salad and mango; also certain sides such as crabmeat required extra cost.  The bowl itself appeared a bit unassuming - the presentation would have been better in a clear instead of white bowl.  The fish and vegetables were quite fresh though.  Overall average with less variety than other poke locations.  Price: 3/5  Average given the smaller portion size and less variety compared with other locations  Service: 4/5  Staff were very patient at explaining the process of ordering; friendly and efficient  Overall: 3/5  I love poke bowls especially because of its freshness and variety!  This bowl was okay - I would have liked more toppings and was expecting a slightly larger portion size.  Overall average but good choice for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the other poke place yet so I'm not going to say one place is better than the other... but I guess the problem is I have been to Hawaii multiple times and have eaten my fair share of poke there, and this place just didn't do it for me.  First of all, traditional poke.  White rice + a copious amount of raw fish.  Not salad.  Not tortilla chips.  Ditch the toppings that don't belong.  Don't need fancy sauces to top it off.  Second, can they be any more stingy with the protein? The scoop is the same size as my small cookie scoop at home.  I got a tiny smear of masago as they used a knife to scoop it out... not even a spoon! I don't know how anyone can be full even eating the large bowl.  I know seafood is expensive and we are in land-lock Alberta, but my bowl was nowhere near satisfying.  As far as taste goes, you pick your own sauce and veggies and they toss it up for you.  The only reason I'm giving two stars was because of the stellar and friendly service."}
{"text":"I showed up at 12:30pm and already there was a long line-up. We waited about 30 minutes and I thought it was worth it.  A regular size sets you back only $10.50 with two small scoops of either octopus, ahi tuna, salmon or tuna. Unfortunately, Kona was out of ahi tuna and a few other things, but this just gives me a reason to return. If you have a healthy appetite, I recommend getting a large, which is only $13.50 or adding another scoop of fish or crab/avocado to the small size.  I enjoyed the brown rice, which i ended up liking more than the traditional sushi rice. I ordered my bowl with tuna and salmon poke, and all the toppings except jalapeños. The sauces were nice - I picked Kona ponzu, volcano and spicy mayo. Great flavours and textures. Fresh, light and healthy (if you go easy on the sauces), what a great option in the +15!"}
{"text":"Went to this place since it was walking distance during business hours. It was ok compared to Poke on centre street and 9th avenue. They were cheap with the protein. Didn't have Ahi Tuna, which is the basis of Poke, no furikake topping...since they were so cheap on the protein, I was basically eating rice with sauce. Tried it once, probably never go back. Much rather make a trip to Poke."}
{"text":"The flavours are definitely there! And the design of the restaurant is super fun and cute. Helpful and friendly staff too. But if you get rice with your poke bowl, which most people do, it comes it so hot it starts cooking the fish immediately. It therefor gets gross super fast. It starts fresh and delicious and then gets warmed up and that is just a no no for me. Wish they'd work on that."}
{"text":"Meh... after trying Pokehana in the U.S. recently, this place is disappointing. Not as fresh. Less care and attention put into preparation. Soaked in sauce. Rushed creation shows in the results. The place on 6 Ave SW is better."}
{"text":"Poke is the best thing that has ever happened to me since sliced bread. The setup is fairly simple, build your own bowl. The price structure is reasonable and the variety of fish is great too. Now down to the nitty gritty: the fish to sauce to toppings to base ratio aren't proportionate. I ordered the regular bowl which gives you two scoops and you have a choice to mix (amazing!) the type of fish. Then comes the rest, the rice overshadows everything else by a huge difference and then you get mostly toppings. The sauces I chose were also barely there which was a disappointment to me. Overall, the experience was meh. I still prefer Po-Ke compared to Kona."}
{"text":"I had friends take me here a couple times for lunch and I enjoyed it very much. I really like the options and how healthy it is. Both times I got the large bowl, with greens, tuna, salmon, and spicy poke, topped with toppings my way and guacamole and crab salad as paid topping, so yummy."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch during the week and there was a line but the staff were efficient and friendly so it moved quickly. It's a build your own bowl situation with a lot of different options. I hadn't been before and was feeling particularly hungry so I went with a large bowl and continued to fill it will all kinds of delicious and wonderful things from salmon and tuna, rice, cucumbers, jalapeno, wontons, avocado and spicy mayo. The bowl was overall pretty good but mine was definitely to spicy (which is my bad, it was my selections) but it was very filling. Overall it was decent, a bit pricey so it wouldn't be my every day spot but more of a once and a while treat, I think I also need to fine tune my choices, there are a lot of options and mine didn't all quite jive together in the end."}
{"text":"Alright kids, gather 'round. You know how we used to gripe about how lame food options were in Calgary / the +15's? Kona Poke is the start of a very exciting trend.   As a office dweller who frequents the +15 networks, seeing the drab interiors of outdated buildings clad in gold frames (like the fireplace at your grandmother's house) kind of makes you dead inside. Enter: Kona Poke. I watched this place with eager interest as I walk past everyday, and now that it's finally open, I got a chance to experience it.   You'll walk past and you'll ask yourself, whoa, am I in the Bay Area, SF? Poke is the next hot ticket item, and this is where it starts. The decor is hip, simple, and welcoming, and the staff are awesome and friendly. The vibe here was executed perfectly.  Onto the food. For those of you that don't know what Poke is, think of it as a Hawaiian style deconstructed sushi bowl, with a grain (rice, or greens), a protein, (raw fish, octopus, vegan), veggie toppings, a sauce, and bowl toppings (salmon roe, sesame seeds, etc). The ingredients they used were high quality. Most importantly, the fish was fresh and not at all fishy. The sauces were great, and the balance was pretty good - obviously it would be hard to not have wished for more fish, but that's life.   As far as pricing goes, I felt that it was on the pricey end. I would need the large option to consider it a full lunch, and for $16 for takeout, this is about double what I would usually pay for a to-go lunch, and therefore not sustainable on a regular basis. That being said, I don't feel that their prices are necessarily unreasonable - fresh, raw fish can be expensive, and the pricing is therefore understandable.   This is the next big trend in hip, fast, and health(-ish) lunch. The Poke train is leaving the station, so y'all better hop on!"}
{"text":"Visited this place last week with some friends to pop my poke cherry.  New place so the lineups were very long, snaking into the +15 which was like a greenhouse since it was a sunny day.  I ordered the large bowl for $13.50 and unfortunately they ran out of ahi tuna just before I got there.  I went with half sushi and half brown rice,cucumbers, onion, cabbage, albacore tuna, salmon, octopus, finished with ginger, sesame seeds, furikake, green onion, wasabe, masago.  The seafood was dressed in the Kona Ponzu and I had spicy mayo on top.  It's set up like a Subway style assembly line.  But the poke-artists were definitely much livelier than your regular sandwich-artist.  Nadim in particular was great, apologizing for the wait and provided alot of energy and interacted with each customer.  Overall in terms of value, $13.50 is ok since you get sushi seafood and much more customizing than a typical sushi roll will allow.  However, the sushi rice was mushy and there was just alot of rice in the bowl compared to the fish/toppings.  I was dissatisfied with the ratio of fish/toppings to rice I had in each spoon since there also wasn't enough sauce to properly dress the rice.  The flavors were good though and overall was a good introduction to poke.  I would recommend going with the regular bowl since their rice scoops are larger than their fish scoops, so going large and adding 1 scoop of each means it increases the disparity.  If you are really hungry and you must come here, I would recommend asking for more sauce so you don't end up with spoonfuls of plain mushy sushi rice (brown rice was nice and nutty with a bit of pop but still lacked flavor by itself)."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a colleague. It was good but portion wasn't like big. I got the regular size Poke for $10.50. I chose ahi tuna and salmon as protein, had inside white rice, cucumber, onion and red onion, green onion, sesame and other things that are not spicy.  Overall, price I guess it's ok but portion was small. It taste good. I had it with ponzu sauce and regular miso. Maybe the two combination made it a bit wet and salty. They were quite generous in the sauce.  The place is busy during lunch time. You can see the line out the door. It is located in the plus 15, Chevron building. There are seats but it's around the corner of Kona.   Overall, recommend coming here for lunch. They closes at 2pm."}
{"text":"WOW so amazing. Portion is small but its so good. I loved the maple miso sauce. Great in the poke. So I got:  Regular poke bowl (2 poke scoop) White rice Cucumber, sweet onion, red cabbage and pumpkin seeds (limited time only) Salmon and Ahi tuna  Maple Miso Green onion, masago, furikake and wontons chips  They serve it in a plastic bowl. Portion is small for the price they charge but its so delicious. I walked from downtown Beltline to try this location.  This is the second location but I personally like this location more than their first location on 5th Ave. The place is newly open. So yummy.  Too bad I missed their grand opening, heard the bowls were discounted. So I regular bowl is $11.75  Décor is nice. Its clean. Very open style. They have a long table if you want to meet some friends. They also have tables for 2 or 4 people. As well tables along the window. If you want to stare outside while eating (that is for people like me who wants some own time during lunch time).  Parking is a hit and miss in this area. Its not that busy. The location is located below a condo tower.     Overall Yum. Highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews for this place a few weeks ago and finally got the chance to try it out today. So good! I had the large bowl with half brown rice and half field greens. Three scoops of Spicy Poke mixed with cucumber, cabbage and jalapenos, topped with Kona Ponzu and spicy mayo, finished with crab and avocado, furikaki, and green onions - delicious! It was definitely large enough to fill me up and the flavour was amazing. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you love sushi and salads, this is the place to go. The lines are long, but move quickly.  The prices are reasonable for a sushi dish. 15 bucks gets you a hefty bowl of rice and greens (you get to choose your base), sushi (I had salmon and tuna with spicy Mayo) then additional veggies, more sauces and added avocado.  I devoured it and now sadly feel overstuffed, but it was so delicious!   I'll be returning! I love that you can get sushi to go like Freshi but with way more meat and flavour:)  Highly recommend to all sushi lovers."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their bowls are so fresh and tasty and the staff are engaged and friendly! Octopus is hard to cook correctly but mine came out perfectly and not chewy. Don't worry about the lineup, it's worth the wait and the ordering process goes by really quick."}
{"text":"Very delicious rice & fish bowls!!  They are super flavourful and healthy!! I really love this place!! Perfect for a quick to go lunch! The best part is that you can customize your bowl and just add those ingredients that you really like! In addition the service was super friendly and fast! Nothing to complain !! I would definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"Best poke take out in the city hands down. Sauces are great, service is quick and friendly. Good quality fish. Splurge on the crab and cado- it's worth it!"}
{"text":"OK, I gave another try at Kona Poke.  This time I went with 3 scoops sashimi, more salad and vegetables and less brown rice and added on avocado & toppings.  Sauces:  ponzu, spicy mayo and lava.  Beautiful and utterly delicious!!"}
{"text":"O.M.G.!  2nd location of Kona Poke is now open!!  It's on the south side of the street in a new building.  Lots of on-street parking and an outside parking lot across the street.  The poke bowls are AMAZING, just like the 1st location!!  Had the ahi tuna and salmon regular bowl with all the trimmings.  A must have is the avocado.  The sauces I usually get are the Kona Ponzu, the Lava and the Spciy Mayo.   I love Kona Poke!  Today is especially great 'cos the price of the regular poke bowl is only $5 and for the large poke bowl is only $8 due to their grand opening specials!!  Love that the restaurant is open for longer hours as well as during weekends.  Very nice restaurant which seats 35, a mixture of a long table, bench seating with stools and a window ledge table with high chairs.  Long line-up when I went for lunch today!    Congratulations to Kona Poke on their 2nd location!  Looking forward to the 3rd location (in the downtown Core area, please!  wink! wink!)"}
{"text":"Such a great healthy lunch option downtown! Two scoops of ahi on top of field greens with cucumber, cabbage and jalapenos, topped with Ponzu, spicy mayo and Lava sauce. Finished with furikaki, and green onions. So tasty!"}
{"text":"We went at around 12:30pm on a Thursday, so of course the lineup was insane. But the Kona crew kept the line running smooth & quick! It was a very well oiled assembly line, and they did it all with the best customer service, I was so impressed. My tuna bowl was the bomb, super fresh, and the sauce guy mixed me up a combo of the Kona & Lava sauce which was delicious. Price was great too, the 'regular' size was perfect for me. I want to go every day!"}
