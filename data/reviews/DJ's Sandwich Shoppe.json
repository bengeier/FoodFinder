{"text":"Former greasy spoon turned badass sammie shop.  This place is really good. The food is down to earth and delicious, and you can tell they don't want you leaving here hungry. DJ is a great guy to talk to while eating, he has a lot of cool stories and he knows what's what.  Stopped in today for a bite with a friend, he got the Rueben, I got the Italian hoagie. Both of these sandwiches came piled high with meat, some zesty Zapp's chips (voodoo flavor to be exact), tomato, lettuce and pickle spear on the side. The Italian hoagie came with pickled onions and saut√©ed mushrooms. We both ordered some fries - I don't know what they do with them, but damn are they good. I think they soak them or brine them, and after cooking them throw a little seasoning on them, perhaps? Good stuff. Although it was lunchtime, it looks like they serve breakfast dishes all day long, which is cool. I am def going to try the frog legs at some point in the future. I will be back, I know that.  Your friendly neighborhood sandwich shop! Support local business!"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall, but a hidden gem. All the regular sandwiches you'd expect to see, but some very imaginative specialties too. How about Buffalo Frog Legs and Lamb Brains ? Both were delicious. Made right in front of you and super friendly staff. Check 'em out."}
{"text":"Probably the best steak sandwich I've ever had. Great guys running this place in supporting local businesses. I'll definitely be back for the tacos and the Reuben sandwich next time"}
{"text":"Well, can't say much for the food because I didn't eat here. Which is such a huge disappointment, I was super looking forward to it after hearing so many good reviews, as well as having really great expierience with the crew at Dj's butcher block. But, that's the exact opposite for Dj's Sandwich Shop. The 2 person staff made me and my friend feel so uncomfortable and unwanted we just decided to leave.  When we walked in, there were about 4 customers waiting for to go food. We seated ourselves at the bar, neither the guy or girl working greeted us in anyway other than slightly side eyeing us and looking annoyed we were there at 1:00 in the afternoon. As soon as we say we realized there was a cell phone at my friends seat, so I said to the guy- is this someone's cell phone? Is someone sitting here?  Now, the tone of voice to which he replied \"that's the STORE phone\" and with and irritated gesture slid the phone across the counter away from us, looked at the girl and said \"can you get them drinks?\" To which she just sort of dumbly stared at us, and turned back around and continued doing whatever she was doing and not acknowledging us.   It was so awkward and uncomfortable my friend turned to me and said \"this is weird. I really don't want to eat here. To which I completely agreed, and we left. No acknowledgement of us leaving either.   Seriously, look into your staff, because they suck at human interactions. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Honestly, you could put some of these dishes up against ANY in Pittsburgh, and you wouldn't be able to tell which one came from the Michelin striving one and which came from the small diner-esque area with an appreciation for Davey Crockett decor.  I honestly think this has potential to be the best place in Pittsburgh (I've been to Gaucho once, but was more blown away here).  First, it probably helps that they have access to the freshest ingredients possible.  Out of steak for salads? Go to the butcher shop (who owns both) a few buildings down and get some (which was just obtained from a local farm earlier that week).  Out of tomatoes? Go to the Linea Verde Green Market next door (it's a market of fresh vegetables/herbs etc...).    Onto what we ordered.  Egg chorizo tacos, steak avocado salad, potato pancakes with smoked salmon and pear apple sauce, and lastly the mako shark (yes, shark) over fried vegetable rice.  Each one of these dishes were immaculately prepared and cooked to perfection.  My shark was perfectly textured, somewhere between white fish and chicken breast.  Delicious with the rice.  Best steak salad I've ever eaten (it helps when the steak is super high quality).  The smoked salmon had to have been from Wholey's, but I can't prove that.  They have a standard menu, but they have specials regularly, and their are very unique options on there (they had blackened frog legs as a special, along with the above listed shark)  I'd say the only \"problem\", is that it's not really open for dinner hours.  But it's a diner setup, with limited seating, and the hours coincide with the butcher shop (probably necessary, as it's access to ingredients depends on the butcher shop being open).  But screw dinner, DJ's Sandwich shop will have to settle for being the best lunch I've had in Pittsburgh, even up against heavyweights like Morcilla.  GO TO DJ'S SANDWICH SHOP, THEN GO TO THE BUTCHER AND PICK UP DINNER!  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:  The Faces.  The Rolling Stones, The Who  (and The Kinks, to a lesser degree) got all the hype, and justifiably so.  But The Faces were probably just as good despite the lack of advertising."}
{"text":"This place is a tragic case of food poisoning waiting to happen. I had an undercooked venison burger. My wife had half cooked pancakes. My 18 month old had barely cooked French toast. We witnessed the waitress/chef handling raw meat then our food, back to raw eggs, with no hand washing in between. The inside of the building was well over 90 degrees. By the sounds of it, Dj doesn't care about the place at all. We returned the food and insisted on a refund."}
{"text":"The chili cheese dogs are fantastic, the chili truly is the star of the show! The hand-cut fries are seasoned perfectly and will absolutely haunt you in your dreams.. seriously, they're that delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Stopped here for late lunch on a Saturday. I had the steak hoagie and BF had the buffalo frog legs at the recommendation of the cook/waiter who was super nice, helpful and attentive. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The meal was quick but not rushed. I can't wait to come back and sit outside on a nice day."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place, but they were not met.  We went for lunch.  The menu was crowded and hard to read for me.  I got the venison bacon burger with egg, with lettuce, tomato, and onion, cooked medium.  My girlfriend got the chicken chorizo egg tacos without salsa.  The wording was a little odd, as it wasn't clear if it was a venison burger with bacon on top, or a burger with venison bacon.  Our server explained that it was a venison burger with bacon mixed in.   We shared a single order fries and our server convinced us to get both the cheese and chili on top.  We got just water to drink.  The waters were delivered first...  in bottles!  We were not asked if we wanted bottled water.  My burger came out, minus the LTO or any condiment other than a sunny-side-up egg.  The girlfriend's tacos came out, plus the salsa mixed in.  Strike on both.    Somehow my burger was rare on one side and well-done on the other. I looked closely to see if there was evidence of bacon inside, but I couldn't tell (or taste).  The burger, with its crumbly roll, drippy egg, and thick slice of tomato was a beast to eat.  Not quite good enough to finish, though.  The fries looked like they'd be pretty good naked.  However, they were buried under what looked to be cheese from a can and chili from a can.  The grease pooled up in one corner, and pretty quickly ended up overflowing onto the ground.  (We sat outside, where the metal tables have holes by design)  Then came the check.  $30 for a two-person lunch with a single split side, with water to drink!  Oh yeah, those waters were $2 each.  Upon attempting to pay, I was told that it was cash-only.  With Mama Ros, I would have paid half as much, gotten a hug, and been quite happy with my lunch.  With this incarnation, I feel swindled.  I have no plans to return here."}
{"text":"Ya got your classic DJ's - shipshaped into a delicious crafted sandwich - shared the steak & onion hoagie, great portion size.  Super high quality steak. He pickles his own onions too. get it. so good.  Watched someone walk out with the meatloaf, which I'm totally gonna try next.  Would love to see em open for Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Small little shop with one person handling the orders and cooking.  They were out of a couple of items so the small menu was more limited.  Had the Rueben.  Sat and watched as the meat and kraut were cooked.  Tasty sandwich.  Would not hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch stand.  I ordered tacos--they were super-inexpensive and tasty.  Service was fast.  They took over from Roz...did a great job.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"OMG you guys I am stuffed! I ate way too much because it was so good! I couldn't stop. So my boyfriend had a cup of chili and we split a basket of onion rings (I ate three) and a club sandwich. The sandwich was stacked fully three levels high and sliced in three (I hate only one of the portions and feel like I ate the whole thing). Absolutely filling and delicious. Fresh turkey, ham, bacon, lettuce tomato and NY sharp cheddar with basil mayo on the side (I hate mayo) and a pickle wedge. The bread was a white/rye marble. If you want a truly good sandwich served up just right, go to DJ's! We washed it all down with Ginger Beer by Red Ribbon. Two thumbs up, gang!"}
