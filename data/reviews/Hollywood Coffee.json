{"text":"Super cute, friendly family oriented coffee shop. HIGHLY recommend it. The owner is so nice. We will surely be back and with our kiddos."}
{"text":"This quaint little coffee shop and cafe has all the right feels of a mom and pop shop! My husband and I came in with our sons and the owner made us feel very welcome.   We enjoyed the BLT sandwich which was very reasonably priced and big enough for us to split. We got iced coffee to go, and some snacks for our 2 boys.   If you're looking to support local businesses, give Hollywood Coffee a go!"}
{"text":"Tried to go here for coffee based on excellent yelp recommendations. At 8 o'clock on a Friday morning, the lights were off and the door was locked, although the hours on the window or 6 AM to 9 PM. There's no sign indicating such, but it would appear it is out of business?"}
{"text":"After driving by this place everyday on my way to work I finally decided to change things up and went to Hollywood Coffee instead of my daily Starbucks. It was SO GOOD and the owner is very nice. I'm now a new loyal customer"}
{"text":"Hollywood Coffee is amazing! Not only is the coffee delicious but so is the food. And you get a fantastic value for what you pay for both food and drinks. I highly recommend checking this little gem out. The owner is super friendly and always wants to take care of the customer and make sure you're leaving happy."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is very nice and has so many good options if you are looking for coffee/tea, breakfast, lunch or just a snack! I would recommend for everyone!"}
{"text":"Ever had one of those Sundays when you wake up and you instantly need to take a nap? Yeah, that's my Sunday.   Feeling the need for a good bean water, I fired up the trusty Yelp app and found this great new business nearby. Looking crusty with my glasses on and hair being extra staticy, I stumbled to this haven. I don't usually write same-day reviews because I'm lazy but here I am showing love to this great new place! The owner is a retired pharmacist and seriously hooks it up.  First of all the White Chocolate Mocha here is, dare I say, comparable to the one at Jean-Philippe Patisserie. It has good flavor and is full-bodied without losing that delicious espresso taste in a sea of sugar. The Caramel Macchiato with coconut milk is also good. With coconut milk, you can get the rich creamy mouth-feel (that's what she said) without the lactose. Soy milk, almond milk, and coconut milk are options here.  Want some noms? They have burgers, tuna melts, lox and bagels, egg salad, some yummy cakes, and many packaged snacks if you're on the go. They use Seattle Best coffee here so it's a good brew and for a good price. $7 for two huge drinks. What a steal!  It's small in here but that's what makes it charming. Support this great local business!  4.5 stars but rounding up because the owner and barista are so freakin' nice!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were headed to the hookah lounge at 9pm when we stumbled upon this little gem. We walked in and ordered something \"yummy\". The owners refused to serve cold coffee so he turned on the machines (which had been turned off for the day) and offered to walk over our order. The drinks matched the costumer service and were amazing. If you have a min you should stop in and enjoy.  -Adrian's girlfriend"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, bagels, and service!  Very clean inside and the service is always great.  The jalapeno cheese bagels are amazing!"}
