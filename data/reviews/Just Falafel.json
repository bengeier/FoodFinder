{"text":"Great menu of all vegetarian items. The Chick'n Burger was delicious with a crunchy, tender patty. The wait is a bit longer than most fast food places (like the first reviewer mentioned), but I'll excuse that since many of their employees seem like they're just learning the recipes. Looking forward to trying more of their options!"}
{"text":"I love that place.. Their ingredients are fresh and it taste like a real falafel that you usually eat in middle east. I loved the Idea of having a baked healthy choice of falafel.  The tabbouleh is not the best but wasn't bad.  The place is so clean.and most important part they have delivery"}
{"text":"clean place,delicious falafa just like the one you can find at home. you can choose if you want it baked or fried .Also,you can take your falafel by piece with dips or in a sandwich of your choice."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but was really disappointed because of exceptionally rude service. The wait was vey long, forgiveable since they recently opened. The problem started when I noticed that the man (who seemd to be the manager or owner) making my food was making me a burger not a wrap. When I told him that I ordered the a falafel sandwich not a burger, he said that I couldn't just say a falafel sandwich but I had to use their description to order it. He then read through the (overly complex) name of every sandwich on the menu and proceeded to make me say the exact name of what I had wanted before making it. It was incredibly rude and condescending. He never apologized or acknowledged that the cashier had clearly misheard my order. When I asked to be refunded the difference between the falafel I ordered and what the cashier had accidentally charged me for, the man muttered something rude and walked away. The cashier apologized profusely but wouldn't refund me. The falafel was pretty good but not worth the $9 I paid or the terrible service. With so many places in the area that have polite and customer-service focused staff, I will not be going back here again. A terrible experience."}
{"text":"Kind of a modern take on old school falafel wrap. A number of variations on the vegetarian options, my favourites are the Indian, Mexican and Italian. You can request certain ingredients to be added on top (no charge if you ask nicely). I like turnips and hot peppers.  Falafel can be baked or fried. To be honest I haven't figured out the difference yet. You can also choose to skip the bread and get it as a salad bowl (but I don't get it).  The restaurant serves freshly prepared vegetarian fare and that's a welcome addition to this area over saturated with meat and fish options."}
{"text":"Whole menu is Vegetarian with plenty of vegan options.  Best falafels I've had in Toronto by far.  Reasonably priced especially as the food is always fresh & great quality.  Love this location & friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Slow - I waited over 20 minutes for my falafel plate. Poor - the quality is low; there are far better options."}
{"text":"October 22, 2015. Ordered 12:02pm. No lentil soup available. No wraps other than original available. Hardly any ingredients prepared. Sad. Haven't received order yet. It's 12:28pm. 2 stars only because it appears safe and clean and falafel made to order.  Update: 1:00pm. I've finished eating and my gf is finishing now. The pita was dried out making it impossible to contain the food inside. It cracked and was a saucy mess because there were barely any ingredients to absorb anything. They ran out of all but hot sauce and tahini. The only positive I could remark on is that the made-to-order falafel balls were decent.   I cannot see a second visit in my future with so many good falafel and shawarma places around."}
{"text":"The Best Falafel and a lot of dips to choice from..   Staff are friendly and accomodating.."}
{"text":"I found the speed of the service a little slow for the small about of customers that come through. I think they've just hired a bunch of new staff so it's understandable. The falafel wrap I got was tasty. Not bad for a not-too-filling / just-right lunch in the $5-7 range."}
{"text":"Very tasty falafel, but don't come here for quick service (folks behind the counter aren't familiar with what they're making)."}
{"text":"Very good crunchy outside soft inside falafels...the tabbouleh and baba ghanoush are freshly made and very good...the falafels were light and very flavourful...I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I came here after reading the load of positive reviews on Yelp- and have never been so disappointed. Maybe it's because I replaced falafel for a chicken shawarma, but this is definitely the LEAST AUTHENTIC chicken shawarma that I have ever tasted. DO NOT COME HERE FOR A CHICKEN SHAWARMA."}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon this place today. Wasn't too busy during the lunch rush which was great for me. Lots of great options. I had the Great Canadian bowl. So yummy! I like that you have the option of having baked or fried falafel which they make fresh when you order."}
{"text":"Fast, flavourful, friendly, and simply fabulous. I stop in here most times when I'm in the neighbourhood and am never disappointed. Keep it up guys - Great job!"}
{"text":"What an extremely over-complicated experience! I really wanted this place to be my go-to when I'm feeling too lazy to walk any further than a block, but unfortunately, I don't think I'll be coming back. I ordered the Mezzo(?) platter and I was really excited for some fresh veg food.  Once I got to the cashier,  she said hello and then promptly engaged in a heated discussion over who is signed into the register with another worker. And then it got to a point where she fished an old receipt out of the trash bin behind her (with her gloved hands!!). From that point on, I was regretting ever having stepped foot into this establishment.  But, to the point.   The good: I was excited to have some fresh vegetarian food that would be prepared in front of me. I chose the right menu item as it was a mixture of a whole bunch of stuff (their falafels, salad, hummus, pita bread, vine leafs).  The bad: The cashier promptly informed me that, no, this dish would not be made in front of me and that I would have to go ahead and select my items out of the fridge they have.   The ugly: The only thing that was made fresh for me were the falafels. And boy, did they not deliver. The falafels were one of the hardest falafels I have ever had the displeasure of consuming, and they tasted of old dirty oil.  Conclusion: Ever since this terrible day, I have been telling anyone who asks not to go to this place. I'd rather spend another half hour walking than eat here ever again. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because I'm nice enough to understand it's a new business and that they still might need to tweak a few things."}
