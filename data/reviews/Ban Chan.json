{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Arizona. Things are off to a great start when we tried out the ban chan. The HyeJang Soup and Bibim Nengmyun are my favorites. 

The soup is a vibrant, spicy red -- thickened by the long-stewed and bits of meat that have fallen off the bone. The meat have generous portions of tender that just slide off. The spices are accentuated by just the right amount of fat from the meat."}
{"text":"I really like their ban chan as u can tell from their  name. The foods were fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Refreshing to finally have good korean food in Arizona. It is clearly a family owned mom and pops business which is what keeps good home cooking alive. The service is typical of Asian restaurants and the good was great. We had the spicy chicken and neng myun. Both great. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We stopped by this restaurant on the way back from Tucson this weekend. Some of our friends recommended it and we thought to give a try. We ordered the Kbbq combo. It has a spicy bbq pork dish, several kinds of fresh green vegetables and soup and many side dishes. It was so delicious. I think it is the best Korean food in town. Four of us were even able to finish the combo. Taste great with reasonable price. Definitely will stop by again and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Back from work and now I am in the mission to find Korean restaurant & grocery shopping. 
This place had lower reviews but I wanted to try my own. 
Visited on Thursday night which it was pretty quite & kind of empty. 
 
I ordered Kalbi tang (Kalbi soup) & my guy ordered spicy pork. 
Lady brought ban Chan & rice. 
I want to know why this place is not over 4 stars???!!!

Call me an old lady but their ban Chan has very shigol (country side) flavor. I asked the lady why not so busy when her food reminds me of country side food in Korea. She said her popular customers are elders.  If you know Korean food, the flavor is different depends on territory in Korea.  Their radish kimchi was really good, other veg I dishes were really good too.  But surprisingly, cabbage kimchi wasn't that good. 

My Kalbi soup was pretty good. Spicy pork was better than the soup. I have to say the pork was better than I expected.  Better food than Hodori Korean restaurant.  

So good I went back on very next day for lunch.  This time I ordered saum jok tang (beef tendon soup) & my company ordered Tuk-mandoo kook (dumplings & rice cake soup).  The owner brought out few more extra ban chan for us to try.  
Both dishes were so good.  I asked the owner lady if they have a mackerel & radish dish, she said even it's not on the menu but I can still order it. 

She also sell ban chan if you ask for it. Her ban chan was far better than the one I buy from the market.  
Ban chan is my top of Korean restaurant near me."}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd like this place by reading all the mixed reviews.   But I am very happy that I went in.  My son who has become a very picky eater was already upset  when we walked into the establishment.   He wanted American food and  wore a frown on his face.  We got a very mild tofu soup for him.  Ordered the Meat Jun,  bbq chicken and Panjeon  too.  We were amazed to see how much banchan was served.  Most places serve 4, but we had 8, and they were all delicious.  My son's face lit up when he saw the potato banchan.  I gave him some chicken and Meat Jun.  He didn't care to eat his tofu soup.  He was all over that Meat Jun.  My son doesn't really care for Korean food but that Meat Jun won his heart.  My husband is now a big fan too.  We found out the server is from Hawaii, and that was a big plus too.  He served us with that big Aloha spirit.  We will certainly dine here again."}
{"text":"A male maybe is the manager, is very rude to his customer. When we ask for a refill of side dishes, he is very unhappy and said: no more, last one. Alright, then I will give you one star. Every Korea restaurant will have free refill for side dishes, if you restaurant don't have just let you customer know, don't let me feel uncomfortable about it."}
{"text":"All the meat, soup, and noodle dishes I had were pretty good. Definitely not the best I have had (considering I have been to Korean about 20 times), but by far the best in Arizona hands down (I have been to Cho Dang, Takamatsu, Hodori, Gogi, and Korean BBQ). This place just opened up a little over a week ago, so I am writing this review based on my three experiences there. The staff is friendly, the service is good, and the decor is... Well, let's just say that the food definitely makes up for the decor; keep in mind that it is a restaurant, not an art gallery."}
{"text":"We were there last week and we order a set for three of us. And it is too much compared to the price! Totally WORTH IT! The foods were amazing. Hot pot and pancakes and fried meats. We love it! And the service was fantastic. It feels like the restaurant running by family. The owner also the people who serve us which is kind of weird but he is nice .Definitely want to go again."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean restaurant in Arizona now.  We were leary to try it because we arrived at 830 on a Wednesday night and the open sign was off and there were no customers at all.

Also, the yelp reviews were mixed but we decided to try it anyway.

The Kalbi was well marinated, it wasn't overly sweet like most restaurants.  All the small Kim chi dishes were the best I've had at a Korean restaurant in Arizona.  I always complain that the Kim chi in AZ restaurants suck.

This is a very authentic Korean restaurant with many dishes I've never seen offered at most Korean places.

With that being said...be careful when ordering some of the more interesting dishes because you may not be used to it.

For example, we got the stir fry octopus which I LOVED! But it is very very chewy...so it's not for everyone.

We also got the cold noodles with skate and squid.  The skate is like a salted raw fish with all the skate cartilage intact.

We LOVED it and will be back!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and the service is a bit slow when it's busy, but very nice people and friendly! There Korean short ribs are delicious! I would come here again, the only thing is .. They should have more sides because when I came in they ran out of mostly everything."}
{"text":"We had a very good meal at Ban Chan.  The fried dumplings we had for appetizer were near perfect.  My soup, I got the dumplings and rice cake (#20 on the menu), was very good as well.  There were plenty of dumplings and rice cake slices to suit the hungriest guest.  The broth was mild and flavorful, but I would have added some black pepper to it if it'd been on the table.  The traditional sides were awesome, my favorite is the turnip, little cubes of delicious, tingly awesomeness. My husband thinks they taste like gasoline, but I love them.  There were also lots of more adventurous choices on the menu I'd like to try, but I like to start safe in a new place.  We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything there. Homemade recipes with one of the largest variety and portions of side dishes."}
{"text":"I went to eat here the other day just before dinner time. I've tried 2 other Korean restaurants and i think this place has a lot of potential. 

I was scared because the place was empty. Not a soul in the place empty. Mid meal people popped in. Korean people and they genuinely enjoyed the food so I finally understood how this place works. 

Atmosphere: it feels like a pop up restaurant with not a lot of thought put into it. If you can get past the old musty smell it might not be so bad. I grew up in a big family and found myself in the most humid places (Texas) so it didn't really bother me. It feels rundown but not quite hole in the wall just yet. 

The food: my sister and I split a tofu soup and bulgogi. I actually enjoyed the food a lot and it totally hit the spot. Tofu seafood soup had a deep seafood flavor but no signature egg but still lots of seafood in it and it was great. The bulgogi wasn't too dry, too sweet and they tenderized it so well and you still got these thick cuts of beef with great flavor. 

The service: homeboy was cool. He refilled our drinks, apologized for lack of Mountain Dew I wanted on a hot day and thanked us for coming in. 

The price: people always tell me Korean food is so pricey for each entree. But you get tons of side dishes and they are unlimited so I have no problems paying $9-$15 for a plate. If you had any idea all of the ingredients that go into these dishes it's worth it."}
{"text":"It's sad this place has gone down hill.  They use to have the best meat jun and Korean side dishes in the east valley. However, recently they have begun using lower quality meat and giving smaller portions to offset the cost and they often do not want to give you the complimentary side dishes that they use to gladly provide. 

Each time I've gone here during the past 6 months, I'm always the only customer. It's sad to see such a great business struggle. The sauces and flavors are on point but the current quality of the meats and the smaller portions are truly what makes me not want to return. I think I'll stick to Paradise Hawaiian meat jun in Tempe(although not as authentic tasting as Ban Chan-it's just much better quality meat and bigger portions)."}
{"text":"Good and plentiful food. Good prices for amount you get. Only negative is their beverage selection was limited.non ice tea, and canned soda."}
{"text":"I adore Korean food, This was my least favorite. For a new restaurant it was dingy and used looking.  Very sparse. The menu was deposited on the table, no drinks were offered only a lukewarm water glass.  We ordered the combo, chose the spicy pork bulgogi, and the short ribs.  What a disappointment. We always patron Takamatsu's but decided to try this as it was new and the ratings were good.  If you are not Korean, the  portions are pathetic, for 21.99 we were given what I would expect as a meager lunch portion.  I noticed that others that ordered the same dishes were given much larger portions, and also given much more personal attention.  We stated that it was our first time, but it made no difference.  What a shame as when we love a restaurant we spread the word.  The same is true for when we do not like a restaurant  only we tell more people."}
{"text":"Great food! Price is not bad compared to many other Korean restaurants. Awesome service and best of all the food was great will be going again for sure"}
{"text":"If you are looking for homey comfort Korean foods in Phoenix, this is the place to go. The food was great and was very affordable. The owner is very kind and welcoming too."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean food by Arizona standards. Side dishes are great and the staff is polite. The menu could use some work as people completely new to Korean food may not know what Yukgaejang is, but for those who are already familiar this is the best Korean food I've had in the valley (and I've been to all the major ones, Chodang, Hodori, Gogi etc). Highly recommended, don't miss this place! Got the Spicy Chicken Filets dinner plate, very tender and delicious with the side dishes."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has a low rating!

The food is amazing. The owner and his family are super nice and provide great service. 

I highly recommend this place to any Korean food lover."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on Saturday evening and we enjoyed it.  Prices are not the cheapest but they give you a nice amount of food.  These people are originally from Honolulu and I can tell by the taste that this is \"Hawaiian style\" Korean food.  Another sure-fire giveaway is that they have meat jun on their menu.  Although jun is an authentic Korean dish, you can never find it on the Mainland.  Another favorite in Hawaii that is hard to find is bibimkooksoo.  The food was tasty but I was somewhat disappointed in the banchan.  While they gave us about 6 different varieties, they never asked if we wanted refills and the kim chee was rather weak in taste."}
{"text":"Good authentic Korean food place. The portions are a bit small for dinner considering their \"dinner\" price. The waiter was super animated and was pretty attentive to our needs. They did run out of lettuce which was a disappointment. The decor and ambiance of the place could be improved some."}
{"text":"Best Korean meal so far. And believe me, I've tried almost all Korean restaurant in the valley. Love all the side dishes. Our Kalbis were tasty. Excellent service too."}
{"text":"I had craving for some Korean BBQ so we tried BanChan.  I had this idea that this restaurant will have great side dishes since it's called Banchan, which means side dishes in korean.  But I was greatly disappointed.  Maybe because it was lunch time but our side dishes were very plain.  Also kimchi tasted like store bought.  I ordered Kalbi with cold noodle and my husband ordered mix of spicy pork and bulgogi.  I really like their cold noodle but kalbi I didn't like.  One piece was just huge fat.  Also all the meats were really salty.  Service was great even though only one lady did everything from taking orders, bringing food, and cashier.  She was very nice.  I wish the meats were just a little less salty.  Also I was shocked that they didn't have deserts like piece of fruits or SikHye after meal.  My husband seem to like it though.  He wants to go back for Mokgoli meal deal.  We will go next time for dinner and see if the side dishes are better."}
{"text":"The restaurant is kinda hidden in the plaza on Dobson and Guadalupe. The place is small but clean. Service was good and we didn't have to wait to long for the food. We ordered some Gogi, spicy chicken, tofu soup and some Korean street tacos. Everything tasted delicious and the portions were generous. I highly recommend the Korean street tacos!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Def Leppard - Love Bites)

I really wanna try your cuisine Ban Chan
Cause eating food from your menu drives me crazy
I know you think that Kim Chi is the way you make it
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to make it

Oh!

Bo Bites, Ban Chan
It's bringin' me to my knees 
Bo Bites, Ban Chan
It's no surprise 
Bo Bites, Ban Chan 
It's what I need 

I rather enjoyed visiting this place.  It's definitely a family owned restaurant.  I totally dig the 80's pop music playing in the background of the restaurant!

I attended with my buddy and his wife.  I went for the usual Tofu beef stew while my friend went for their special kalbi beef stew and seafood pancake.  I regret not getting their special cause my tofu beef stew was pretty bland in my opinion.  It came along with some vegetables mixed within however, it just didn't work for my taste buds.  The seafood pancake was okay at best since it was overly done with scallions; like way too many!  The star of the night for me had to be the Kalbi beef stew; man why didn't I get it!  I had one bite of my buddies to try it and right away I knew I made a mistake in my ordering.  With similar ingredients as my mines, but it had that salty sweet kalbi beef taste along with the stew.  The aroma itself was strong enough to make me saliva!

In the end, Ban Chan is lovely homey spot.  I definitely would return to keep trying out their food and just to listen to some good 80's oldies! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We decided to go here to try the Meat Jun.  What a mistake! The meat was very tough and bland. We'll be sticking to Paradise Hawaiian BBQ for our meat jun cravings. Our dining experience wasn't pleasant since they didn't have their AC on.  The waitress stated that it was a little broken but it seemed to me that they may just have been cutting down on operational cost especially seeing how slow it was at noon. 

  On the plus side their yuk gae jang was delicious, better than takamatsu and hodori.  I wish they served  kimchi with it which I thought was quite odd.   ."}
{"text":"I visited here with a group of American friends today and I felt even embarrassed at the fact I chose this restaurant. Everything is so untidy, and the dishes are so not presentable at all. I ordered a spicy bulgogi dish and I expected it to be on a small pan or a grill with a wooden plate underneath as all other korean restaurants like Koreatown or OHYA do with theirs, however, they put the meat with a big scoop of rice, on the same plate. Before i was even half way, rice got all soggy from the meat broth and i didn't want to continue eating. I can understand it is not a big restaurant but I couldnt help but keep getting dissappointed by next dish and the dish after. We ordered jap-chae(potato noodles), spicy soft tofu soup, haejang-gook (not sure what this is, but it has chinese cabbage in a spicy broth), and a rice cake soup. The service was okay, so i'm giving 2 stars. Won't be coming back though."}
{"text":"Food: I really wanted to like the food here but it was very disappointing. I love meat jun, Kim Chee jun and every type of korean pancake. I eat a lot of it back home and I don't expect food in AZ to taste like home whatsoever but my meat jun and kimchee jun here was really bad. My kimchee+pork jun had zero pork in it. It was also extremely thick/dense and doughy. And the meat jun barely had any beef in it. I know meat jun has thin slices of beef in it to begin with but this was almost transparent--the slices were pounded so thin. I will say though that their ban chan was not bad. 

Atmosphere: Mom n Pop kind of place. 

Service: friendly but not helpful. After checking out my takeout order, I asked if my Kim Chee Jun had pork in it (like the menu says it comes with) bc I couldn't see any. The kind woman said yes (probably assuming/hoping it had some in there without checking with the kitchen) but when I took it home and ate it, I found NONE. 

Price: Disappointing after I didn't get the correct order.

I hate writing bad reviews for establishments, especially Mom n Pop kind of places, but food speaks for itself and my experience/food was just not good. Maybe it was just an off day for them."}
{"text":"The best Korean food in Arizona hands down! Prices are very fair, staff is very nice, we go there usually once a week. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here because of the pictures of the Kalbi tacos and I've been craving some korean/mexican fusion due to the lack of Kogi trucks in my new state. 

Sadly that was only a temporary promotion/special so they weren't available and the food was just OK. 
There was a miscommunication with the server with one of the menu items and her recommendation (the soup stew) actually ended up being the best dish we had all night!"}
{"text":"i was excited to see that a new Korean restaurant opened up and decided to drive over for dinner. Both the food and the service were very disappointing.

The service was beyond terrible. I walked in and had to seat myself because no one gave me any direction. I sat there for five minutes and no one came over, so I went to get a menu myself. I waited for 10 minutes and still no one came over to take my order. There were two tables right next to mine, and the female server brought items to their tables while I was sitting there trying to get her attention. After 15 minutes of just sitting, eventually the male server came over and took my order.

For a place called \"Ban Chan\", their ban chan is not only very limited, but gross. There were a total of 4 side dishes, 3 of which were odd and inedible. The cooked turnip had a very fishy taste to it, then there were the mushy/flavorless collared greens, the picked vegetable and pickled turnip were just not good. All of the side dishes were lukewarm.

I ordered Haemul Pajun (Seafood pancake); it was thick and full of undercooked green onion.The Kalbitang was very salty.

It was a very disappointing meal."}
{"text":"This place was great! We're used to Hawaii Korean food and it tasted just like it. And why you ask? Because the cook is from Hawaii. Regardless of that, the food was spot on and the service was wonderful. We will definitely be back often even if it's 2 hours away for us."}
{"text":"They've changed the menu a number of times as well as the quality of the food. Not sure why Korean restaurants in AZ just can't get it right."}
{"text":"It's a small family owned restaurant but the food is great! The side dishes (ban chan) is good and they give you a variety. Their kalbi tang is really flavorful too!"}
{"text":"Okay, so being korean...and i had a korean restaurant in the family for a very long time I am bound to be bias...so i will only write pro and cons in comparison to other places  

Pros:
1. The food is good. It taste like your grandmas home cooking which is hard to find these days
2. Service is fast and friendly.

Cons:
1. The decor is depressing.
2. Only two highchairs(last time i check) no family with multiple toddlers.
3. Togo: You order it the banchan (side dishes) are not separated with foil like other places...so by the time you go home its in lone big mess.  Make sure all your condiments are there before you leave. Several times i had missing things...silverware, salt and spicy sauce.

Food to get: 
Haejang gook
Squid stir fry"}
{"text":"With a name like Ban Chan, you should expect nothing but freshness and high quality with the ban chan they offer. The name does live up to the hype, as they make their kimchi fresh, and all the other ban chan they offer is very flavorful and goes well with your meal.

I've been here a few times, and the service can be spotty. It seems hit or miss based on my experiences. Our last outing here, they forgot about one of our dishes that we had specifically requested to bring out before the meal as an appetizer, and also did not put in one of our orders. 

The food though, is good. I've had the meat jun, spicy chicken, pork and kimchee pancake, and the mandoo. All have had great flavor, and have been prepared well.

Also to note: If you order iced tea and ask for sugar packets, they'll give you a covered bowl of sugar since they don't have packets of real and imitation sugar."}
{"text":"I had just finished with a power red donation at the Chandler Blood Donation Center and was told to make my next meal a hearty one. As such, Korean food seemed to fit that bill as the often cold climate of Korea has led to a culinary tradition that is indeed hearty, as well as spicy! 

I found Ban Chan on Yelp and decided to check it out. I will say it is authentically Korean. The only thing interesting is I walked in the door and was asked if I needed anything versus if I wanted a table. Then, when I had let them know I was there for lunch the owner brought over a 2nd menu with little hearts next to certain dishes and let me know that the hearts indicated dishes that I would be more comfortable with relative to my first experience with Korean food.

Having grown up in Hawaii though, I've eaten lots of it and let him know that I doubted anything on the menu was outside of what I had eaten before. I would recommend, in the future, that the owner ask a diner if there are familiar with Korean food before pulling out the safety menu, or ask if someone wants a recommendation.

However, beyond that, great food! One thing I love about Korean food is the side dishes or what are referred to as Banchan. The owner brought out several different ones, from the traditional KimChee to some amazing Miso potato wedges, loved them all and he even asked if I wanted more when I quickly finished off several of them.

For the main dish I had a Korean pork and tofu stew with aged KimChee, savory and delicious and it was brought to my table in the traditional cast-iron bowl, bubbling hot, with a side of rice in a separate bowl. I think the meal, without tax, was only $8.95 so quite affordable and it definitely met the blood bank recommendation of hearty. I would happily come here again and hopefully, I won't get the training wheels for eating Korean food menu next time I come through the door.;-)"}
{"text":"Nice mom & pop restaurant with nice staff, good service, and great food for a great price!  It's not fancy, but definitely cozy and comfortable.  I highly recommend it! Support the little mom and pop businesses!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Korean restaurants I like coming too .. I like ordering their hae Jang gook here.. And I like the side dishes they give with ur food.. It's never busy when we come here but than again we always come before or after the lunch and dinner rush I guess u can say.."}
{"text":"Meat jun was on point here. Not greasy and bangin flava. Only downside is the dinner prices. A bit steep. Aside from that I'll definitely be bringing back my Korean bitches. Fa sho.  Now leave Korean Jesus alone!  He ain't got time for your problems!  He busy, doin Korean shit!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Again, my reviews are based on comparisons nationwide.  This place is fine.  I could come back if convinced.  Nothing was bad about this place, nothing was really great either, it was just a decent Korean meal.  Unfortunately, comparing it the other Korean joints, even just in the Valley, doesn't quite gt to 4 stars.

We ordered the kalbi tang and naeng myun.  Nothing special, very average.  The kalbi tang comes out looking impressive, it's nice and hot and the volume is good.  The broth is a little thin.  Full disclosure, I'm picky about my naeng myun being as my father is from the province in Korea where naeng myun was made most famous.  This one was fine but lacked pizzazz and again, short on flavor in the broth.

Also, for a place called Ban Chan, expected some really excellent ban chan.  They are better than average here, especially compared to other Valley Korean restaurants.  But then you compare it places in LA like Soban, and you can't give this place 4 stars.  

We did take an order of their pre-made ban chan home with us, the kae-nip jang-a-chi.  It was pretty good, close to what my mom makes.  

But all in all, still giving this place a rating of very average."}
{"text":"Reall korean homemade food!!! Best hole in the wall i have ever found definitely coming back !"}
{"text":"The food here is authentic. I ordered bulgogi for lunch and it was fresh and flavorfull.  I have only found food better in Korea."}
{"text":"If all you care about is taste, this place is good.
But I can't get over my horrible experience last time. My boyfriend and I ordered one dish each. I got my dish kimchi stew about 15 mins later. And we kept waiting and waiting for his food to arrive - which was bulgogi btw. When I saw the huge group who arrive much later than us getting their food, I had already finished my food. 
I asked the waiter about it and he told me we didn't order the other dish! That really pissed me off. I distinctly remembered ordering his because my bf fumbled on saying bulgogi and I corrected it. That shameless man cannot get 2 orders right and tried to act like he did nothing wrong...AND made us wait another 20 mins before it came. 
Zero apologies and absolutely horrible attitude."}
{"text":"Service has definitely gotten better & the food is better. For the price you pay ($69), it's plenty of enough to go around for 3-4 people."}
{"text":"I tried their food at the Asian Festival in Scottsdale this past weekend.  For $10 I got spicy pork, rice, bean sprouts, and kim chi.  Pretty good value considering the price and quality of the other festival food that was offered.  I really enjoyed the texture and flavor of the pork.  I don't think I've ever visited the restaurant, but now I would like to.  Especially now that I see that their menu offers a spicy tofu soup, I love that stuff!"}
{"text":"Want fewer wrinkles?  Eat collagen-rich food!

It was the day after the Winter Solstice.  The desert had gotten much rain the night before the the skies were still grey and heavy with dark clouds.  I had wanted some hot soup to stop the chill in my bones.  Enter Ban Chan.

The two of us ordered a kalbi (beef short rib) soup and beef marrow soup.  While waiting, we were served up some banchan.  With a namesake of Ban Chan, I was expecting to be blown away.  I must admit, I wasn't impressed --- especially with the kimchi which had a weird taste to it.  Side dishes aren't a deal breaker for me so we continued waiting for our soups to arrive.  The kalbi soup came out first and it was flavorful!  It was loaded with giant chunks of spare ribs and it was amazing.  It had good clean flavor.  Next came out the beef marrow soup, which is what I ordered.  It was super light and delicate in flavor which I suppose comes with the territory of health and beauty food.  It had a good helping of tendons but I quickly realized why the waitress dropped off salt and pepper at the table.  This soup really was on the blander side.  I was also hungry a few hours later.  

All in all, I definitely want to give Ban Chan another try and update my review because to be fair, one soup was significantly better than the other.  I probably just ordered the wrong thing!"}
{"text":"a new family owned korean restaurant in arizona! I highly recommend spicy chicken, YUM"}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by my foodie friend and I had high hopes that I was going to be absolutely delicious. Perhaps because they went there for dinner while we were there for lunch that might have made a bit of the different in our experiences. First off, they didn't give us decent portion of Kim Chi to start with and we had total of 4 people. We all ordered ice-tea and the server did not ask us if we want refill once. I ordered the Gabi lunch dish and it was only average. The last dish didn't show up until we are almost done with our dinner. Service is great, owner seems nice, but it doesn't make up for the small portion of Kim Chi and the food."}
