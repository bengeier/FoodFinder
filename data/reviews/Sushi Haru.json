{"text":"A hidden Jem! One of the best sushi places I've been too, super fast, fresh, and clean. The servers were so nice and always make you feel at home. Super kid friendly.  Always reccomend this if people are in the area :)"}
{"text":"Short of Hawai'i this is some of the best sushi I have ever had. The staff is friendly, I have had the occasional meal take a while to come out but that is normal for any restaurant when they get busy. I have eaten here at least once a month for close to a year now and will keep going back."}
{"text":"We love coming to sushi Haru, everyone is always so friendly, the service is great and the food is so fresh and tasty.  We come here at least once a week and it nerve disappoints."}
{"text":"Service: the boss brought me food personally   Food: fresh, chicken crispy, fried ice cream was amazing; recommend strawberry  Location: plenty of parking, close to freeway, easy to find  Cleanliness: bathrooms clean, restaurant clean, everything really clean  Ambiance: quiet and easy to have conversation   Decor: many people like restaurant and have written so on the memory boards hanging throughout   I am tourist from San Francisco and will be back next time in Calagary."}
{"text":"Since it was 30+ deg outside that day, we decided to have something nice and cool for dinner... so how about some after-work sushi in Airdrie!  This is a nice and quiet Japanese restaurant located off main street.  Atmosphere: 3.5/5  Initially, we were the only customers there so it was a little quiet, but otherwise clean and nice decor.  Lots of parking located in the mall where the restaurant is located.  Food: 4/5  We had the sashimi salad, Haru special roll, and mango roll.  Good variety on the menu - I like that in addition to the standard a la carte sushi and fresh rolls, there are a number of cooked roll options, many of which seem quite creative.  Sushi was fresh and tasty.  Service: 3.5/5  Overall friendly and efficient staff  Price: 3.5/5  Overall reasonable for the amount and quality of food  Overall: 4/5  This is a nice, quiet restaurant to grab lunch or dinner.  Location was quite convenient.  Food was fresh and I would love to try some of their other menu options, such as their other cooked rolls, lunch and daily specials."}
{"text":"I live an hour out of Airdrie but gladly make the trip there. Fresh ingredients, a creative menu and wonderful service makes this place special. Love, love LOVE Sushi Haru."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. The owners are wonderful, the service is great and the food is delicious. It is always the first place I think of when I plan on eating out. I try to go back as many times as I can, and bring every one of my friends by so they can also discover this fabulous place."}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese restaurant in the Calgary area.  Their food is of high quality (serving size, flavor, freshness) - their rolls have thin rice so you taste the flavor of the filling.  Service is great - friendly staff and they accommodate special requests (food not on their menu).  We've been going here for years and everything stays awesome!"}
{"text":"Teach a man to fish, he can poorly prepare his own sushi; teach a man to drive to sushi-haru, you can eat delicious sushi and reasonable rates. Come hungry; leave with Mercury poisoning! I'm blind now, but worth every shekel. #fukushima #freeicecream"}
{"text":"Fish seemed less than fresh, rolls were pretty small and a bit sloppy. Also pretty expensive considering those factors. Id recommend Mio over by Kings Heights instead."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I eat tons of sashimi and sushi and this is great. Fresh fish. Quick service. Clean. Assorted sashimi is delicious. A variety of rolls were fantastic as well. Saki is also hot and warms the throat perfectly."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI in Airdrie.     fish always fresh I highly recommend"}
