{"text":"Although HopCat can be extremely loud and crowded at times, they offer a draft list that I have yet to find at any other restaurant or bar in downtown Madison. I absolutely love brining visitors here because it is almost impossible for anyone to not find a beer they will enjoy. In terms of food, the options are fairly comparable to other restaurants that specialize in pub food. I would note that their service is fairly slow. If you are in a time crunch, it may be smart to find another option!"}
{"text":"THE CRACK FRIES FILL MY HEART WITH JOY and the caprese mac 'n cheese & apple juice wings were really good too. I forget our server's name, but he walked through all the beer descriptions in great detail for our table of 6 young ladies (LOL) on Friday night and gave us a very honest description of a local karaoke establishment so he deserves a medal. Alex? Allen? Bueller?!"}
{"text":"Casey was a great waiter. Great brunch with great food and great people. Including Casey."}
{"text":"Great food.  Reasonable prices.  Fun atmosphere.  Fantastic waitress.  Wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"Best beer selection I've seen in Madison. Had a great big burger, tried a few beers with a flight (or two), but the fries stole the show! I don't know how they make those things, but wow they were good.
I'd get an enormous basket of those the next time I go back."}
{"text":"Good beer and mediocre service.  Not very busy but had to wait for second round of beer"}
{"text":"Favorite place to go in Madison. The food is phenomenal and the beers are even better! In the past I have been able to get a taster beer or 2 in case I did not know what I wanted to try. The last time I was there they charged me a dollar for each of these, but this may have just been a particular waitress (unless they changed their policy). Definitely try tasting a beer or 2 as their menu is extensive. The crack fries are amazing. The bruschetta is one of my favorites and they have several sandwiches which are my go to meals everytime we are their. The price adds up, especially with how friendly and attentive the staff is (so you won't have an empty drink for long), but that is not a bad thing. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The fries were listed as \"crack fries,\" and touted as a \"USA Today Top 10 Fries.\"  They're as good as they say, and served with a garlic dipping sauce.  The beer selection is vast and the wait staff was always very friendly."}
{"text":"Great place, huge brew selection and great food.
Small complaint.  Why don't you fill growlers from other brew pubs?
I'm not 100% sure, but I don't believe I have ever had this problem at other pubs.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Have been here about 5 times since they have opened and every time there seems to be something that goes wrong. First time I went I was denied with my real legal ID, now I understand Hop Cat has to be careful with the ID but why the bouncer looked in my personal email on my phone and facebook and still denied me was very annoying. I signed my name three times for him too. I did contact management and they were very apologetic which was nice. As far as service goes: Harvest is the only server that gets our drinks to us in under 5 minutes. (One time it took 11 minutes for us to get our beers, and other times it's always more than 5 minutes which I find rediculous) Harvest also will check up on us often which I really appreciate. Now here's my real reason for giving 2 stars...skunky tasting and smelling beer. The first week all of the beers tasted fresh and how they should but now ( I just last week) the beers do not taste at all like they should which is very disappointing considering they obviously take pride in having so many taps but I don't see the point when they all taste skunky. I work at a bar where we clean our tap lines every 4-6 weeks and it makes all the difference for taste. I will not be going back to hop cat just for that reason alone. I'll gladly wait 11 minutes for great tasting beer but that's not what you will find at hop cat."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Service, beer selection, and Crack fries. I come from the land of microbrewery and this place kills it."}
{"text":"Loved the Kombucha beer! I was here once and although the tap list was very impressive (read: overwhelming), I'm not exactly a beer aficionado; so I probably won't be back. I'm very happy I tried this place out, regardless. They will do very well here- Wisconsinites love their brewskis. 

Cheers Hop Kitty Cat : )

{"text":"We ate there in the early evening hours on June 21st, hardly anybody in the restaurant, but it took 45 minutes to get our food. My burger why small, dry and had the world's thinnest slice of cheddar cheese on it. The fries were unevenly spiced so one bite was super pepper while the next was all salty or nothing at all. After all that it was pretty expensive too for the portions we got for two adults and one child. The waitress was nice, but note to management, if the staff is gonna be able to pay attention to their tables then hold a staff meeting when they have no tables to pay attention to. The only reason it got any stars at all was the fact that they allowed one of us to switch out cheese curds for fries in the burger basket."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I cannot deny that the food (especially the crack fries) and the HUGE beer list are great. The service has always been lacking and I keep going back thinking that it will get better, but it hasn't.

My first time here the door man almost denied my entrance because he thought my ID was fake. I understand that in a college town they have to be on top of their game when it comes to carding everyone, but I'm 26 and my drivers license is a WI Real ID. This was shortly after their grand opening so I chalked it up to being a brand new restaurant and still working out the kinks.

On my second visit we sat at the bar for beer and crack fries. Everything we had was really good, but the bartenders seemed to care more about talking to each other than keeping our drinks full. 

This past weekend I made another visit to HopCat. When my group arrived there were 3 employees standing at the hostess stand, none of whom greeted or acknowledged us so we went ahead and found an empty table. Then the hostess came over and said \"You guys are just seating yourself? You can't do that.\" We proceeded back to the hostess stand, as did she, and waited to be seated while the hostess fiddled on a tablet for over 3 minutes before another employee came over and sat us. The way the hostess talked to us was rude and uncalled for. Her tone was beyond condescending. Had she said something like \"I can seat you guys in couple minutes\" or done her job by acknowledging us when we walked in, it would have been fine, but she acted like it was the biggest chore in the world. Working in the service industry and being a hostess in particular, requires one to be friendly and welcoming. Our server was very great though- very friendly."}
{"text":"I went to the family and friends open tonight, it was amazing. The food was great and the building is stunning. Having been first introduced to HopCat back in Michigan I was nothin short of thrilled when I heard HopCat was coming to Madison. This will be a place I will frequent. Can't wait for the full tap list!"}
{"text":"Poor service, not a busy time of day. Just a chain, no reason to stop with all of the other good spots in madison. Beer selection wasn't as impressive for what the idea was."}
{"text":"Those fries though!! 

I have been craving fries for the past five weeks! A coworker of mine suggested the Crack Fries, so I got two orders for carryout. I tried one on my walk home and I was hooked! 

Bless those fries and everything they stand for!  

They come with cheese dipping sauce! They cost about $5 per order but are a decent size. 

I plan on going back someday to HopCat for an in restaurant experience, but for now I will laud the joy and tastiness that these fries are."}
{"text":"Good selection on food and beer menu. Support a lot of local breweries. I cant remember exactly what food item I ordered, but i pretty much inhaled it. It was such a good sandwich. I like our waiter too. She was super nice and helpful when it comes to drinks."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the same weekend now! The Loaded Crack Fries and Vladimir Poutine are phenomenal, so was the Bar Zee burger. The beer selection was different two days later, and had an incredible variety. Both of our waiters were tremendously charismatic, and they eve split our burger for us! :)

New favorite in Madison, will be coming back every chance I get!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the Madison scene ... 130 beers on tap and lots of them are LOCAL.  They have an array of styles and they do a great job with description, ABV, and barware including shape/oz.   The selection is fantastic and the food was a pleasant surprise.   For bar fare (apps, burgers, sandwiches), there were plenty of vegetarian options and the super mega crack tots where ... well ... dope!    Our servers (Kyle and Jesi) were on top of their game too.   Looking forward to coming back soon.   So many beers, so little time.  Great atmosphere and location too"}
{"text":"So many options!  Over 100 craft beer taps.  Great location, right off State Street."}
{"text":"HopCat is a date night favorite. The \"crack fries\" are delicious and addictive as one would expect. I'm also a fan of the occasional \"punny\" menu options (vladimir poutine for example). We also love having a variety of beer available to choose from.

The Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. If you don't know what beer to order your server is always happy to help and make suggestions.

We also love the \"on deck\" section of the beer menu that lists beers that are new or expected to come in soon. This section often includes uncommon or new beers that we haven't tried before. It also gives us incentive to come back and try the new menu additions."}
{"text":"This review is only for the beer selection, as we didn't eat.  The taps are front and center with a huge selection of beer; lots of different styles!  I was impressed with not only the friendliness of the bartender, but also her knowledge...nice to have servers in the campus area who actually know their beer! On the downside, I just found the space to be way to cavernous.  You can't really get a neighborhood tavern vibe here, though I doubt that is what the owners are looking to create. Solid beer, but the space is just to big for my liking."}
{"text":"Nice selection of beer and burgers. Try the buffalo chicken wontons !"}
{"text":"I have been to HopCat 3 times prior to today. Each of my previous experiences were enjoyable, something I cannot say about my experience this afternoon. The bar has great decor including over 10 tv's throughout the downstairs. I asked the server to change one of the 11 tv's to a different football game. I was not specific about which television just simply the most convenient one. Since all the tv's in the bar were playing the exact same game, this obviously would not be an unreasonable request. The manager came to our table and told us that she would not change the channel because all 11 tv's had been requested, an insulting lie. Disgusted with this statement after my meal, which was delicious, I traveled across the street to Chasers Bar and Grill to see if they would handle my request. Without hesitation the bartender happily granted my request in a bar that was twice as crowded as HopCat. Overall I enjoy HopCat as an establishment but the blatant disregard for a customer request is something that shouldn't go unnoticed."}
{"text":"I went here during our anniversary vacation and it was a great time.  Our server, Jared, was friendly, attentive and has great taste in beer.  The food was attractve, tasty and came out promptly.  We tried some beers that we would probably never find elsewhere.  We were seated quickly, something I did not expect on  Friday night.  Granted, we came in the early evening and it was not a game day."}
{"text":"Their crack fries are amazing! Very fun atmosphere on a game day."}
{"text":"Great beer and wonderful service even on Badger Saturday."}
{"text":"One might ask, \"what is the difference between crack and crack fries?\" Well, one ruined my life, and the other is a fairly potent stimulant. 

Three stars."}
{"text":"Crack fries are delicious but the rest of the meal fell flat. Ordered the BLT Benny and the eggs tasted gummy.. Not the way I like my eggs! The Eggs Ranchero was okay.. Nothing special or to write home about. Atmosphere was kinda meh but it was the only place without a line for brunch so I guess I shouldn't complain!"}
{"text":"Very impressive beer list, great loaded fries, but the tots and service really set HopCat apart.  We enjoyed beer flights and apps, 2 adults and 2 kids, and had a great experience.  The server went out of his way to double check allergens, even offering creative, not on the menu replacements.  
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Decent burger, okay waiter and pricy beer. I tried the Cowboy burger and it is apparently too much food for a lady. A good gathering place, but also quieter than I expected. I'd say it's a restaurant with a great beer selection rather than a bar.
AND there is a crack on my friend's water glass and none of us noticed until half way through dinner."}
{"text":"This place was great!! We went here for my Bachelorette to start off festivities. Very classy, great selection of beers. Great feel. They were a little over the top asking for ID's however. Asked at the door, at the bar and at the table... I got carded 3 times. I think they are going for a little older crowd.... not old, just older young adults. So 25 yrs and up. Loved it though. So stinkin awesome and near everything! Great location! Great selection! Great service! Great atmosphere! Great time!"}
{"text":"In order for a restaurant to get 4 or 5 stars I believe it has to have 3 things done very well  Food, atmosphere, and staff.  Well the food here is very good.  The spicey fries are absolutely delicious and if you order them as an appetizer like we did they come with a wonderful cheesy dipping sauce. I had the Zee burger and my wife had a salad. Great food all around! The atmosphere was wonderful considering the type of venue it is. Once again I am hearing impaired and the acoustics were not friendly. That is my problem not there's. It is a bar that serves great food just off campus in a major big 10 university on game day. It was a little loud but not over powering. The wait staff was extremely helpful, we even had several staff members who were not ours check to see if all was well. Oh and did I mention they have like 90 different beers !  Seriously, how does the bartender even find what you ordered? They have tables for 2 to 8 and can handle your group with ease. If you are near State Street in Madison this is a must. Looking forward to going again"}
{"text":"5 stars isn't enough for this place. We went in for the friends and family night before the grand opening and to say we were impressed is a huge understatement. Friendliest service, a diverse and knowledgable staff, inviting atmosphere with oldies and soul music, and an unbelievable menu. If there is spinach and artichoke dip on the menu, we order it -- and this was the best we've ever had. Hop Cat has enough beer to satisfy any Wisconsinite (voted top 3 pub in the WORLD). Check out Madison's new hot spot -- we will be back. :)"}
{"text":"There are so many places in Madison to get great beer selections.  You can get this here however, you can also get rude service and rude customers. I don't think there is any point in going here when so many bars and restaurants around town offer better service and a better experience. Go here, but expect an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"The carding policy is very unclear. They very rudely kicked my friend out because she forgot her ID, even though the doors say people below 21 are allowed before 10pm and even though I was here waiting for her. The beer list is impressive but so is Old Fashioned's.

This is not the culture of Wisconsin, where folks go out with their families and friends with under-21 folks all the time."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and a bite while downtown around 2PM on a Wednesday . Bartender was personable and knowledgeable. Very few customers so it was quiet. Beer choices were many and well thought. We enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Alejandro was great. What a wealth of knowledge. He was able to suggest different drinks that suited our palate and was always spot on.  So friendly and kind. We will be back."}
{"text":"We went to HopCat for a friend's birthday. So many taps! Service is prompt and our server was knowledgeable . The Crack Fries are a must! It was very busy when we went, so it was understandable that it took a few minutes for our server to come back to take our order. Once we ordered, the food came pretty quick! It was a little chilly in there when we went, so I would recommend a sweater. However, we went in the summer, so maybe the A/C was cranked up!"}
{"text":"Great crack fries!!  Friendly bartender.  Husband was thrilled with their huge selection of tap brews."}
{"text":"Love all the drafts on tap!  Service was kinda slow,  but it was busy and they had probably 6 bartenders working behind the bar(had sat at the bar,  place was packed for the Badger game). 
Only ordered the \"crack\" fries that everyone raves about, nothing special.....
Pretty sure had I stayed longer,  I wouldn't have wanted to leave and I would have gotten very intoxicated. Fun place for a beer and to watch a game."}
{"text":"Finally made it here on an extremely busy Saturday evening. We had a party of 7 & were seated fairly  quick. I really liked how they text my cell when our table was ready so we were able to go walk around State Street instead of stand around in Hopcat. 

Our server was great. She made recommendations for food & drinks. Despite being as busy as it was our order didn't take long to come. 
The Cowboy burger was amazing & so was the mac & cheese. My kids loved their cheeseburgers & we all loved the Crack fries!!! 

We liked that you can write on the tables with keys or a knife. The atmosphere was awesome. TVs were on & showed various sports.

We look forward to going again."}
{"text":"First time here.  We came for beer and appetizers.  We got the pizza rolls and pretzel \" nuggs\".  The pizza rolls were okay but not great.  The pretzels were good.  I really like the cheese sauce. The beer list was extensive but did not contain the one beer my husband wanted ( lagunitas sumpin sumpin)."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Beer manager even came out and talked to us about the beers they offer and where we could get them. Crack fries are to die for. Staff knows the importance of customer service."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! They had sours which have seemed hard to find on my visit to Madison from CA (so kinda limited exposure). My fries came out cold and the manager came out with fresh hot ones and apologized and gave me a beer on the house. She handled it great and I appreciated it. It's such a simple mix up with fries and they took it serious which was nice to know they care about quality. Fun spot. If I'm back in Madison I'd come back here. Actually tried a new beer from my hometown haha!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience!  Sat at the bar and had some beers and apps.  Staff was so pleasant and really fun to interact with.  Beer recommendations a by the bartenders was right In.  The buffalo chicken aop was great."}
{"text":"Good beer selection.  Horrible service.  I sat at the bar for a full 5 minutes and no one ever approached me.  Seriously not even eye contact, it was like I was invisible.  It was a slow Tuesday night and not a whole lot of bar traffic.  I can't recommend this place based on the poor service levels."}
{"text":"Crack fries. Nothing else matters about this place. If you are into beer, they have a HUGE selection. Atmosphere is fun too. But seriously just go for the crack fries."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful service.  Great atmosphere.  Awesome beer selection and very good burgers.  Fries are off-the-hook.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The wide and rotating selection of beer is what keeps me coming back and bringing a friend or two with me. The food is ok, but I don't go there to eat and would probably eat somewhere else first."}
{"text":"Food was super average. Got a burger with crack fries. Crack fries were good but burger was so so. Beer selection was great but $18 for a pitcher is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Omg, awesome food, cool ass vibe. The rumors are true---these are the best fries you've ever had! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Our first experience at Hopcat and it was splendid.  We were a group of 7 adults and three kids (6, 3 & 1) on a Saturday at 5:30.  The place is loud and fun.  The menu is large and varied. We tried two of the appetizers, the Meat Head Pizza Rolls and Pretzel Nuggz.  Both were excellent. Of the seven adults, all ordered different entrees and all got excellent reviews.  The beer selection (their claim to fame) was impressive, not just because the list was extensive, but because of their attention to local brews.  Not all places with nationwide locations do that.  This is a great place.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food and beer were pretty great, but the wait staff was abysmal. This would easily be a 4 or 5 star review if it wasn't for the waitress. My girlfriend and I came to HopCat on a Tuesday night, drawn in by what we'd heard about their fries, vegetarian options and extensive beer menu. The crack fries were fantastic, and the fish and chips were on point. She had the Kitchen Sink and she was ranting and raving. The waitress was quick to bring us our beers but that was about the only time she was quick. We waited about 15 minutes after that to even place our food order, and then another 15 to get the bill, AFTER she had said she'd bring it 'right out'. We had a small two-seater table at the end of the first floor room, uncomfortably close to a rambunctious table of eight, so perhaps our presence was a bit overshadowed. Nonetheless, we were there first and our waitress wasn't even the one to bring any food out. She simply asked us if we were 'doing alright' a couple times. I'll reiterate - the food was fantastic. Everything I was hoping for. The beer is worth coming back for, but I think I'll sit at the bar next time."}
{"text":"We came here at the end of our latest Wisconsin adventure. We were feeling full of cheese and beer and came across Hopcat after stopping in at Riley's liquor store nearby. So, we had more cheese and beer!

So many craft beers on tap. We stuck with the local 30 section which was a nice way to affordably have some Wisconsin brews! I had my last Spotted Cow of the trip and a Fantasy Factory from Karben4. Yum.

We ordered mac and cheese and an order of loaded crack fries (can't remember the specific name!). Greasy but delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible.

I had been to Hopcat before, and after sending a dish back twice due to errors, I hadn't been back for over a year. I thought it was time to give them another shot. I went in today for a bowl of cheese soup. 

I was seated rather quickly, and my waitress came over to take my order. Bowl of cheese soup, no croutons, and a Diet Pepsi. Simple enough, and my expectations were rather low: quick turnaround and accuracy.

It literally took 20 minutes to retrieve a bowl of cheese soup. When it arrived, my waitress apologized for the long wait. It was cold. About 5 minutes after receiving my cold food, my waitress asked how everything was. Not having time for them to \"make it right\", I opted for getting the meal over as quickly as possible. I figured it will take about as long to get my bill, so might as well get that clock started sooner rather than later...

This is pathetic. A bowl of soup should be the quickest turnaround on the menu, and Hopcat failed miserably.

At least they are consistent. Save your money and find somewhere else to dine. Fa-real."}
{"text":"Ugh, such a cool concept and space. Why oh why the fledgling service though?

What's ironic is that our server had someone shadowing him during the entire service!

We wanted to catch the Bronze medal beach volleyball match, believing that this would be a solid choice with over 130 beers on tap and numerous TVs - it was to be a perfect destination for what we envisioned.

When we got there, we asked for one of the TV to be turned to beach volleyball and it took a while for them to accommodate that request. We were unable to find it through their channels, but that was not their fault.

So on with the drink orders. You are allotted two samples per person, our large group ordered some samples which they did bring out in a steady pace, explaining which was which. The group started ordering their first round and that was the last time we saw any staff for a while.

We waited about 20 minutes until a couple in our group headed to the bar themselves out of frustration. It was a good strategy seeing as how they were lip-smacking their foamy, cold pints as we watched in envy, still empty handed.

Finally the server makes an appearance... to take our food orders. We inquired about the drinks to be told they are on their way... \"do they have to go tap the kegs from the breweries??\" one party inquisited.

The remaining parties receive their beers a few minutes after, at which time the other two pioneers were in need of a second. Again, the drink orders were taken and the wait began again.

Again, frustrated, they headed to the bar to place the same drink order at which point the beers finally make their appearance. This caused great confusion with the bartender, our friend, and the server. Then later on, when they double charged us for the beer ordered in unison. 

Food-wise, everyone seemed happy with their fish fry, burgers, wraps, and wings. The wraps were huge logs served with crack fries. The fish and chips came in a aluminum bucket bowl with fries on the bottom and fish piled on top, served with tartar sauce - no coleslaw. The stacking system made it so that the grease and heat from the fish caused the fries at the bottom to become a mushy, conglomerated mess. The wings were 8 for $10. For the side of the wraps at the same price point, I believe the wings are not of good value. Although good hearty size, when they go for 1/2 price on select days during the week, it's hard to justify the cost. Try the lava flavor (the hottest) if you like that painfully slow numbing heat that lingers on your taste buds. 

Someone else made a good comment that just about summed this place up, \"you get a couple pints of beer and some food and you're out like $40\"."}
{"text":"Their nachos are not good at all. It'll be warm for about a minute and then the nacho sauce is cold. I must have gone when it wasn't busy so that might have some correlation with the sauce not being warm. When I asked for additional items, it took time. I didn't get my drink until after the apps came out."}
{"text":"Love love Hopcat! Awesome beer selection,  really good food. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were great.  Very knowledgeable and willing to teach!"}
{"text":"Went in a couple times now and both were bad. They card you at the door and then ask for an ID with every drink. Manager tried explaining that they have to do it because they have a lot of in's and outs?!? Not quite sure what that means... they just built the place so if the number of doors are really that big of a deal then why didn't someone think of that?"}
{"text":"A-OK. Good prices, mediocre burgers, but very cold inside. It was very busy when I experienced HopCat this fall. Good beer selection."}
{"text":"Extensive beer selection on tap with rotating seasonal specials. They will do beer flights if you ask the bar tender."}
{"text":"Good food, lots of vegetarian options! Tons of beer, awesome fries. I had the porter Joe beer, so good! The cheese sauce with the fries is amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious crack fries and burgers. Great ambiance with TVs playing sports and tons of beer on tap. Great place to watch a game and have a drink."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great concept but definitely need more bartenders. Not only is it super irritating when you have to sit 20 minutes on a bar stool before someone approaches you but the owners are losing out on MONEY. I could have finished a beer and been on to the next in that amount of time. This place would deserve 4 or possibly even 5 stars if they could add more bartenders to the mix. Bad service is becoming more of a norm in today's world and that is simply not okay in my book!"}
{"text":"One dark January night aka like 20 below wind chill, my friend and I drove out to Madison for some fun. We chanced upon HopCat. The delicious smothered fries warmed my soul for days. The beer selection was so extensive, but our waiter was very informative and knowledgeable. It was a great vibe. There was a Packers game going on and the Packers did something and everyone in the place jumped up and screamed like they had all won the powerball. That night...I joined Packer Nation forever."}
{"text":"Over 100 beers on tap! Sheesh! I really enjoyed this place. Very nice and clean. Didn't go to the bathroom so I can't judge that. This is a very convenient location since it's right next to parking. They have pretty good fish tacos! I'm still on the hunt for the BEST fish tacos in town! I haven't found one... YET! Anyway, we sat at the bar and was greeted right away and ordered some appetisers. Their crack fries were pretty good but not too sure of the dipping sauce. I prefer ketchup. The bartender was really nice and friendly as well! So that made things a lot more enjoyable. I would come here with a group of friends and have some beers."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and wasn't disappointed.  We were there on a Saturday night after spending the day at the Art in the Square.  It was about 7 and no wait!  Loved the atmosphere and the waitress was very attentive.  I had the mushroom burger and crack fries with cheese dip.  I loved the burger!  The fries were good too, but more impressed with my burger.  They also had a huge beer selection!  Would highly recommend going if looking for a burger and beer!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, large selection of pretty typical greasy food to pair. Service has always been ok, nothing spectacular. I'd give it a four if we're just talking about atmosphere, beer selection/bar..oh and I can agree with the hype on the CRACK FRIES. They are pretty damn good with that cheese sauce. Other than that, every time I've eaten here it's been alright, not bad, just not anything special."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving HopCat a 4 instead of a 5 is because they got rid of the most amazing pretzel breaded pork sandwich. This things was what dreams were made of. The Vladamir Poutin is amazing, as are the crack fries in general. I'm not intrigued by any of the other sandwiches so I stick to the buffalo rolls, which are great (though sometimes MUCH spicier than others). Overall a good pick."}
{"text":"Smells like bleach and cleaner so bad it made my eyes water.  The food is basic.  There are other places that have a solid beer selection.  130 beers isn't enticing...not like I'm gonna drink them all.  I'd rather be at a place with better food and atmosphere with 10 beers on tap.  There are dozens of those in Madison."}
{"text":"Service and food was just OK. Fun to go with friends while watching a game.

Fries were good and there is an extensive beer menu."}
{"text":"A fairly large group of us wanted to go here this last Friday for beer, fries and the Badger game.  We got there over an hour before tip-off, and put in a name and number.  We let them know that because we were so large, we'd be willing to split up into smaller tables.  Not everyone in the party was arriving right away, so we thought that would be easiest for the staff.  
The first five of us waited over an hour and were never sat.  We checked in with the host a couple times, reminding them that we'd be willing to split up.  We found out that a few of our friends in the reservation were in line outside and were not being let in due to fire codes.  We also found out that they were sitting multiple groups in front of us (even after telling them MULTIPLE times we would be willing to split up).  I understand that you have to follow fire codes, but you'd think a restaurant would account for the people in reservations!  They were letting in people for a different group of 12, but not for ours.  That was it for us.  We closed our tab and left immediately.

Finally, as we were leaving, we were told that they were understaffed that day and they couldn't open up the 2nd floor because of that.  Otherwise, they would have been able to seat us up there.  I'm sorry, but it's spring break and a Badger game Friday--why wouldn't you make sure you were staffed???

Needless to say, I'm highly disappointed in HopCat's customer service towards large groups.  I understand that it's difficult to seat a group of 12, but we tried to make it as easy on them as we could.  But seating other groups in front of us, and not letting in people that are part of our reservation is not cool.  As much as I love the large beer list and fries, it's going to be difficult for me to come back. 

And just as an FYI, we went down to Brickyard BBQ and they sat our large group immediately with no issue."}
{"text":"This was my second time trying this restaurant and I'm not going to lie i was not a big fan this time around. I loved that they utilized yelp and we could tell how long the wait was and could even book a table instead of going in. The cheese curds were good and the crack fries too. The burger was a bit burned and the pulled pork was a little dry and the cheese on it would have been better if it was melted instead of just being placed on. The service was not that great either we sat down quickly but it took forever for our waitress to get our drinks. They do have a great selection of beer. I will probably only be back for that next time."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do. It has all the makings of a great bar and grill, but frankly, the service is HORRIBLE. I've been here 3 times, twice for brunch, once for dinner and it is the same. Slow process, wait staff doesn't refill drinks, different wait staff seems to be the issue. One to take your order, one to serve your food, another to serve your drinks, makes for a very inconsistent experience. Waitress essentially vanished on two different times I was there, and I had to go to the bar for drink refills. Take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is what a University campus in Wisconsin is all about. Beer, fries, and trivia. They have an insane amount of beer on tap that is always rotating. You can sample the beer before you try it too! The fries here are definitely the best I've had in Madison. There is a reason they are called crack fries. The mac and cheese is good, the burgers are delish...I mean, you really cannot go wrong. Wednesday night is trivia night! This is one of my fave places in Madison."}
{"text":"My time at HopCat left me with the impression that any combination of food, beer, and experience could leave a person feeling from one to five stars. Having shown up and bellied up to the bar in order to (a) watch the Cubs and (b) not feel bad about eating fish fry alone, my experience was overall favorable.

The service at the bar was excellent - friendly, fast, and with good knowledge of the menu. I had two beers off the extensive list, which offered a lot of new options for Madison. In particular, they had a few nitro taps, which I enjoyed tremendously. The list seemed short on stouts/porters at the expense of beers more suited for a long night at HopCat, which I don't blame them for.

I ordered the fish 'n' chips with Crack Fries on the side. The fish portions were smaller than is typical for a Wisconsin fish fry, but it was cooked very well with a tasty tartar on the side. The Crack Fries were far too salty, but dipping them in the tartar helped. 

Despite all of the remodeling, somehow it still kind of looks like Quaker Steak (that space's former incarnation) inside. Not a quiet place by any means, but as a place to be alone together and enjoy some sports and beer, HopCat fit the bill."}
{"text":"Went to Hop Cat on a late Saturday afternoon, was not very busy, staff was helpful, very relaxing atmosphere and lighting with graffiti and good music. My son and I split a couple of burgers and crack fries with cheese sauce, they were good! Will come back again."}
{"text":"There's crack fries. But then there's crack fries covered in a sour cream gravy with pierogis and onions and goodness and called Vladimir Poutine, you know?

The club sandwich had a cool twist of added egg salad and avocado and was huge and delicious. 

Minus a star because our server was frankly awful. It was a Sunday evening and the place wasn't busy. But the bigger crime was that she was fully clueless about beers and lied about it. 

Friend asked for an amber that was not too malty and was served the maltiest amber I've ever tasted. She asked questions about the next beer and the waitress admitted to not having had that beer. At this point at least she offered a sample, but it was after our meal had finished. All a little \"too little, too late\" - we'd have asked for that before if we knew it was an option or if she's had stopped by our table at any point, really. 

The food was great, the beer selection is spectacular - but basically if you're going to be a beer bar in a city that has folks with a lot of beer knowledge, your servers have to stack up. She needs more training or she needs to be able to go grab someone else who knows more than she does."}
{"text":"This is a pretty common gathering spot for me and my friends for a few reasons: 
1) It's spacious - there are two floors which means lots of seating and options for bigger groups 
2) Their beer selection is pretty much the biggest I've seen in Madison so there's something for everyone. I almost always get beer when I'm here so I can't really speak to the mixed drinks. I had a gin and tonic here once and it was fine. 
3) Their crack fries are aptly named. It's the perfect thing to get for the table while you're drinking some beers. I also want to bathe in the cheese sauce that comes with the fries...totally hits the spot after a couple beers. 

All in all, it's a good place to go for groups, I don't know if I would go on my own just for food since there are so many other options on State but for drinks with friends, it's a solid option."}
{"text":"Best beer selection 130 beers on tap, have had the Crack fries and they are pretty good , but the beer is the real treasure here, you can find some of the most exotic beer and ciders here all on tap!"}
{"text":"Gosh.  I really wanted to like this place.  We came here before a drag bingo event to grab a drink and a bite to eat.

The interior was pretty fantastic.  It was spacious and open and I just loved that it didn't feel cramped.

However, I must say, I was so turned off by the service.  Our server very clearly did not want to be taking care of us and she really didn't.  It was to the point where no one at our table was comfortable asking for anything because we didn't want to get another rude look or judgmental tone of voice.  We honestly felt like a burden.  Our drinks took forever to arrive.  Our order took forever to be taken.  I'd like to try and make excuses to help our server out here, but I can't.  The restaurant was not full by any means.  I just don't know what the deal was on this one.

My food was just meh.  I ordered the Supper Club Wrap because I was curious about deep fried egg salad.  But, really, it was nothing special.  The portion for the price is underwhelming, even when it comes to the crack fries, which I was told were to die for (they were not).  The wrap was pretty bland.  Not what I was expecting.

Overall, this place just left a bad taste in my mouth and I don't anticipate going out of my way to go back here."}
{"text":"If you've ever read my reviews before, you know I'm not much of a beer drinker- but this place has a wide selection for every beer lover and one of the cool things about this place is they give you 2 free samples of any beer on the menu-which anyone would agree is a smart & generous way of not making someone commit to a beer that sounded good but didn't live up to their expectations.This was my second time coming to HopCat. I haven't had too many chances to try their burgers, but I split the 'Bar Zee' burger with my boyfriend. I liked the burger but the jalapeno cheese tasted more mustard-like than spicy. What I really liked is that they split the burger in half for us with half the amount of fries (which really are addicting & so delicious) so we didn't have to do it ourselves-we didn't ask for it to be split in half so it's service like that, that stands out. We also ordered the loaded pretzel nuggs- and ohhh my goodness, my taste buds were in heaven! There was a generous order of nuggz just smothered in rich cheese sauce and bunch of savory fixins. I highly recommend this. 
The first time I came here, split a basket of wings & Vladimir Poutine. The wings were good, but I wouldn't call them the best I've ever had like they advertise and I really enjoyed the Poutine. 
Overall, I think this place really excels at apps/sides. Of course I'll be back to split another burger or entree with someone and definitely go after some appetizers"}
{"text":"This place impressed me.  Was here on a very busy weekend and found the service to be good, enjoyed the food, and WOW the beer selection.

OK first the beer.  They had 100 on tap, and some fantastic craft choices as well.  This was a reason enough for the beer geek to come on in.
I tried one of the burgers and ordered medium and was happy when it actually came out medium (don't see that often in bar & grills).  Their \"crack fry's\" are quite good as well.
The building is big, clean, and modern.  I saw an upstairs as well, but didn't go check it out.  The main area has ample bar seating and several tables with TVs strewn through out.

I'll be back next time."}
{"text":"This place is one of our absolute favorites! First time here and management treated us so well. The food is phenomenal and the craft beer list has so many options to choose from definitely a must stop when you come to Madison! Love this place:)"}
{"text":"I have had this place book marked since they opened so I stopped by for some craft beer. There is 125 beers on tap at any given time so the beer menu changes in minutes. 

Once again I picked another place that is very popular because we got the last open seats at the bar. The place is decent sized with a fresh look to it. It has nice seating with booths, tables and large bar space. The walls are colorful and have a graffiti style look to them. Overall the place has a nice modern look and a grand stair case in the front leading to the upper floor.

The service was slightly lacking and could have been better because they didn't acknowledge us at first and walked right by us for some reason. After thinking about the whole experience overall I decided I'm going to not take any stars away and over look this because the place was almost completely full.

While the beer menu is really large but I found a couple beers I liked. The menu can change by the minute because at least four taps get changed while I was there. The beer menu has a red stamp with no beer for you when one is gone and an up next section to show you what's coming on line as beer drops off the list.

Overall it's a nice hip place that attracts all kinds of people because parents brought way young crying children who have not yet been taught how to behave to annoy the people around them just because they can, you have got to love that. I really wanted to try the food but we had other plans so I can't comment on the food here but still a cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and an innovative menu only serve to enhance the experience you get at a bar with 130 taps.   Best place on State street for beer lovers."}
{"text":"HopCat is a great addition to State st., filling a serious void in the Madison restaurant scene-a BIG, lively bar with above average bar food. I like going to HopCat because of the extensive beer list (130 taps), atmosphere (great music, cool decorations), and obviously the crack fries. It's a great place for either dinner or drinks later at night, especially in the winter. 

I always order the Angry Bird (buffalo chicken) sandwich which is delicious. It comes with crack fries which are seriously some of the top 5 French fries I've ever had. Get the cheese sauce. I've tried a couple different burgers on the menu and they didn't really blow me away, so I would recommend trying other options. 

The service unfortunately ranges from okay to abysmal. On my most recent visit, it took 20 minutes to be waited on and another 20 until we got water. At least their great beer makes the wait for food tolerable."}
{"text":"Stopped here on game day for lunch. Wasn't too crowded & plenty of room! They have 130 different tap beers! 

I ordered their burger with the hot dog/cheese/onion rings & it was delicious (I think it was called the monster burger). The burger included their famous Crack Fries. The Crack Fries were actually really good, I was afraid they might be super salty but they weren't."}
{"text":"Definitely a great stop if you like craft beer and great food!  The food (burgers all around at our table) was great and the fries (top 10 in America) were awesome!  The booths are kind of uncomfortable to sit in, but we made due.  I'll definitely be stopping by again the next time I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots in Madison- right in the heart of everything. The atmosphere is cool, service is great. The beer selection is nuts. The food is always on point too. I'd say this is a must-stop!"}
{"text":"For some reason, I want to give HC 3-stars. But I can't! It's a decent, yummy burger joint. The fourth star comes by way of being a chain. So, do a chain well enough, you get a fourth star from Jake.  Hats off, HC!

Crack fries. Deservedly the first mention, are bomb-dot-com. I've ordered two large baskets, for myself, extra sauce, as a meal before. And I have no shame. They are just tasty, salty, goodness that will add fulfillment to your life.

The veggie burger I have demolished on a few visits is also tasty. Done well for a chain, yet again. Thank you! Thank you! Let me get my veg and french fry dance on!!

Staff is typically standard, but I've experienced above quality service as far as I can recall. EXCEPT when I went on NYE this last month. I went with a friend because there was no cover, and we wanted to just have some \"sit and simmer\" social time without too much ridiculousness. We think the bartender bartender was absolutely high - but we sort of benefited from the kite-flying, and before the shift's bar manager intervened, and replaced this person as our server, we were not charged for 4 drinks in total, and three orders of fries. I ain't mad about it. :)

Overall, HC is casual. Quick (and usually still fast enough when busy). Not expensive."}
{"text":"Ordered a Turkey burger - $10.75 (which came with Crack fries and two quarters of a dill pickle spear) and a Commuter Kolsch 16 oz. beer - $6
- The meal was pretty satisfying and tasty enough to order again next time.
- The Kolsch was pretty light, but with 130ish beers on the menu, we can *probably* find something else to try next time!

Atmosphere was nice: Not too loud, good music, nice decor. Service was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in quite awhile....and wow has the place done downhill.  Server was fine...but didn't know anything about beer....or even what was currently available.  Beer selection overall was nothing special.  Too many ordinary beers...nothing that stood out....but still.....most anyone would be able to find something to their liking...which is a pretty low standard for a craft beer bar to have.  The food was solid bar food.  Came out hot and relatively quickly.   Crack fries are excellent for a carb bomb.  The real problem was the atmosphere....for a Friday night the place was dead. Upstairs was closed...more than half the tables empty downstairs.  The music was horrible.  Not even sure what genre it was overall...but the selections weren't cohesive and no one wants to hear b-side Susan Vega...spoken monotone does not put one in an 'eat, drink and be happy\" mood!  It was a tad too loud for the empty space...but might have worked if there were people there.  There are just too many other restaurants and bars with good beer selections to bother with HopCat until they get their act back together."}
{"text":"Was disappointing with my last visit. The food was good, but that was the only thing.

Drinks took a really long time to get to us - the place wasn't that packed and they had several waiters/waitresses working.

We came here for game 7 of the NBA finals, and the manager refused to turn the game audio on. When asked, we were told that at least 80% of the restaurant had to request it, even though all of the TV's were turned to the game and the majority of the people there were wearing jerseys or obviously there for the game. Left after eating to go to another sports bar (every other sports bar at the game and the sound on).

Needless to say, we won't ever be returning for another sports event. Definitely very unfortunate."}
{"text":"I don't make it to Madison very often and decided a pre-concert snack would be... required.  Hop-Cat being the more than logical choice for a beer geek just stopping through.  The beer was a lot more expensive than expected and a keen and watchful eye would do well to discern the serving sizes as well... that said - the tap list itself is very impressive and suits every beer drinker.  The service
Was very good and the food was incredible.  Crack Fries are a must!  We had the Vladimir Poutine and it made a lasting impression!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice place for a burger and beer during the week when you are downtown. You need to take advantage of the special they run for the burger and local tap beer pairing Monday through Thursday. On the weekend, it can be crowded and noisy."}
{"text":"$15 for 2 craft beers and a great burger. Gotta love college town happy hour! 

Only 4 stars because fries are way overseasoned."}
{"text":"I love Hopcat in madison! I have been here at least half a dozen times - from holidays like Halloween's Freakfest to a normal Tuesday - and it has always been great. Today, we had Kelsey as our bartender and she was too notch, making sure we got beers we wanted and a full pour as ordered. Definitely visit this location! I live in Chicago and like this venue better!"}
{"text":"A great place to relax. An excellent beer selection, reasonable prices and a nice atmosphere. The service is also pretty quick considering how busy they are some nights."}
{"text":"Lame, untrained inattentive server who gave us menus for food that would be unavailable in 10 min, didn't tell us so, then had to try 3 times to order a beer, which each took her a visit to the bar to find out they were out of each one.  We were ready to order food with the first beer attempt, but she kept running away to order the beer, only to find out they were out of that one too.  We tried to flag her attention at the bar flirting with guys while she waited at length for the slow bartender to get a beer.  Finally, we got a beer and gave her our order, to be told the kitchen switched to the late night menu (9 or 10pm can't remember) but she'd take our order and they'd just have to deal with making it.... Which made us wonder if our food quality would suffer (it didn't).  So, she wastes 15+min ordering beer she could have known at least after the first try they didn't have, tells the cooks they have to cook food after menu switch and it better be good - all because her lameness.  The beer was fine, somewhat unique, but not anything outstanding.  Crack fries are nothing special.  Black bean burger was good, but not outstanding.  Everything was cooked properly and good, just nothing special."}
{"text":"I returned for a meal and drinks a few days after my original review. When I asked for sample of a beer before committing to spend $10 for a glass, our server said a sample was $1. Strange, since that was not the policy three days earlier. I have been to craft  beer bars all around the country and have never been charged for a taste. Rather than explore the menu, I ordered my familiar Spotted Cow. I will be less likely to return with this policy. Too bad, because I liked the place."}
{"text":"Huge beer menu and they aren't lying about 'crack' fries. I ate the whole basket in a clogged heartbeat."}
{"text":"The HopCat is a Madison, WI pub that has an awesome selection of beers on tap.  Both national brands and local ones.  It's a big restaurant that was rocking the night I went as it was the Friday before the University of Wisconsin graduation.  It was great to see so many families celebrating their kids accomplishment.  The food is pretty basic fare and the night I went it was a little slow coming out but that could be due to the large parties that were there.  It didn't bother me a bit because I was enjoying the atmosphere.  From the look of some of the parents I saw on Saturday morning a lot of them seemed like they had a good time....reliving their college experience.  Congrats to all the new Badger graduates."}
{"text":"Wow 130 micro brews on tap. Had a great atmosphere and tremendous service. We found bartender to be very helpful recommending what we might like based on our old favorites.  Food was good,  Crack fries amazing. But really for me the beer tasting and variety is the true draw.  We can't wait for Punkin ale season!"}
{"text":"The beer selection was amazing!  Well over 100 tap beers to pick from. We also had the Crack fries, and my oh my, they were unbelievable! It just opened and the staff was learning the beers. Great experience."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday evening around 7:30, and waited about 25 minutes for a table. Not bad. We were able to sit at the bar, but my little sister was with us (who is 18) and the bartender asked her to stand, so that they wouldn't get in trouble for having someone under age at the bar. Seemed a little excessive, but not a big deal. Ordered the Crack Fries and the Vladamir Poutine, not realizing they were basically the same thing, and the waitress wasn't really very clear with us. I generally avoid carbs so I ordered a burger without the bun and she didn't even bat an eye. Overall really positive experience, the beer was great and the food was pretty good. 

The worst part of it all was just that it literally took us 35 minutes to find parking. I understand its a crowded area, but if they're going to expect a good crowd they should probably expand their parking lot."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  The beer selection is second to none, great atmosphere, very friendly service.  The crack fries and the sauce they serve them with is unbelievable.  I can't wait to bring some out of town friends and family here when I get the chance."}
{"text":"Well...my burger was more like a hockey puck and service was almost unbearably slow. Also the french has onion soup was so salty neither myself nor Andy could eat it and there were croutons even though i said no croutons.  Their gluten free bun is also dry and bland. Only reason they're not getting 1* is because andy said his burger and fries were really good. So here we are...stuck in the middle. I'm really going to have to get Andy to start writing his own reviews. Lol. Also really disappointed in the lack of knowledge regarding the gluten free options and the raffle, considering that's the reason we're here."}
{"text":"Hop cat is good... The food is good just your typical American style... Great fries.... And an excellent beer selection... My gripe with this place is the  seating it's to close to the bar... Both visits I was bumped by the bar patrons..."}
{"text":"I went on labor day weekend and was excited to try this place as I have walked by it a bunch of times. I was expecting some crazy amount of people and for it to be poppin on such a great weekend, but alas, it was kind of empty. Now, it's hard to rate this place because that first vibe threw me off, then the beer that i had wasn't too great, however what really was...was the CRACK FRIES. that in itself should get 5 stars, but everything else here. just okay. It sucks because this place, with 130 taps, should be amazing, however my experience was just a little sub par. So as of right now i'm going to give it 3 stars. I do plan on going back, and i'll update this when i do, but from my initial experience. its just okay. nothing too special. 

Happy Drinking!"}
{"text":"Fart load of beers, but atmosphere at Mr Brews down the street is better."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.

I've been here many times and haven't had a bad thing off the menu. I usually stick to the grilled cheese with apple slices and the tomato soup with crack fries. Yum! Boyfriend always gets the mushroom Swiss burger and loves it.

The beer list is almost overwhelming and ever changing. It's a great place to get a local favorite for a decent price or try something new. 

Love the wall art and music is always on point. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Allen is the best waiter! Personable and awesome! ;) will be back to try more food and beers - crack fries and muffin top burger rocked my word! Love the atmosphere! ;)"}
{"text":"Look, I get it. I'm in Madison. The Packers rule the airwaves. As a a recent Michigan expat in Wisconsin I understand the Packers should be on almost every TV in the area. However, it's September 3rd (read still NFL preseason) and my Michigan Jim Harbaugh's are playing their first game of the actual season. So I sought out a familiar Michigan-started bar to belly up to drink away my inevitable disappointment. I went to hop cat in Grand Rapids frequently as an undergrad and figured there would be ONE TV devoted to the game.

I got there right at 7:30, just in time for kickoff, but saw no Tv's devoted to the game. I ordered the rye farmhouse ale on the menu and asked for a TV for the game. My waitress said it shouldn't be a problem to put the game on and went to go grab my beer.

Realizing she was dealing with an excessively effervescent beer and a finicky tap, I asked the next nearest bartender \"when you get a chance I was hoping to get the Michigan/Utah game on. Is that possible?\" He walked to the end of the bar, helped his customers and came back and immediately said I would have to talk to the manager!

\"What?\"--For a damn football game? --For one TV?

Thinking I could have a reasonable conversation with the manager I acquiesced to no avail. Stating he had already given up one TV for the UNC/NC-State game I was rebuffed. Apparently he couldn't spare another TV for an actual relevant game. I could either wait two quarters till the Packers game was done or chug my high gravity beer and move to a different venue. I,  like any great Midwesterner, would do chose the latter.

TLDR: Hop Cat is unreasonably concerned that someone from Wisconsin will find out they are a company started in Michigan. I went to Hawks and was immediately provided not one, but two TV's to watch the game. 

If you're looking for someplace to watch sports and you're looking for customer service that isn't thoroughly underwhelming avoid Hop Cat."}
{"text":"I feel this location is a step below the original location. They do have a lot of beers on tap but that includes many common beers and the serving sizes are a bit smaller than other beer bars.  The crack fries are very good.  The service was OK."}
{"text":"Their signature burger (which we got with the chipotle black bean patty) rivaled any burger I've had around the area. The seared tuna with wasabi peas also had a great texture contrast. I will definitely be a regular when I'm downtown!"}
{"text":"Lots and lots of beer options. Over 100 to be exact. Beers are organized first by local brews, then by type. Some rotate, some are standard.

Service is pleasant and professional. Seems like lots of college kids work here, and why not? It is right down the street from college.   

I had the chicken sandwich, but had it made as a wrap at the suggestion of my server. It came with the Food Network recommended Crack Fries. Gotta have the crack fries and sauce. Food was good. Portion was a bit large for me but a small to go box solved that.

Fun music. 

Soccer on all tvs.

Street parking.

Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now. Generally a good selection of beer and a huge food menu. There's a reason why the fries are referred to as \"Crack Fries.\" By far the best I've ever had in my life. 

Service is friendly, but due to its location, it can get rather busy and you don't always get checked in with as much as you may like, and it's hard getting the attention of passing wait staff. Acoustics in the building are not fantastic either, so when it's busy it becomes incredibly hard to hear anyone that isn't right next to you."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places in Madison! Excellent food, really great atmosphere, friendly staff, 130 different beers and crack fries--what more do you need? I highly recommend the Madtown Grilled Cheese."}
{"text":"Unmanageably overcrowded despite the large space with mediocre bar food and a large selection of beers. We waited for 20 minutes for a table Saturday night. Our server was well meaning but clearly not trained to be professional, it took over 10 minutes for her to stop by our table and ask what we wanted (and she never came back to ask if we wanted more drinks later). Many of the beers on the menu were unavailable (\"we had a busy night\"). I had a recommended porter but it was way too watery for me. The shared quesadilla was below average, ingredients carelessly thrown together. This was my first fried cheese curd for which Madison is famous but it was nothing to write home about, just greasy fried cheese with rather too thick and hard batter. Wings were average.

This is the sort of place that gives bar food a bad rep. Use if you don't care about food but only drinks."}
{"text":"I decided to do a small brewery tour of Madison WI and this was one of the spots on my list of places to check out.  While not a brewery, they have over 130 beers on tap, so you stop at a place like that.  They also boast about having the top 10 best french fries in the country... another good reason to check the place out.  We arrived on a Thursday afternoon, so the place wasn't very busy and we actually found out it was happy hour.  That meant half price burgers and $3.50 beers, I knew it would be a good day.  I tried their signature burger and a few different beers.  Burger was great, fries were awesome (not sure 10 best, but still great) and the service was really good.  The only hard part of the whole thing was trying to decide which beers to try, luckily the menu is broken down by type and easy to navigate.  I really love this place and only wish they had one near where I live.  The next time I'm in the area I'm stopping here again, it's a definite must try if you're a beer fan."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. HORRIBLE service! We bought two beers and wanted to order food. We were ignored for 30+min. Did not get a chance to order food. Paid our tab and walked out. Any other place will now get our money. Just not HopCat. Try a little harder to focus on all of your customers and not just two people...or sorting menus. People see this happening. Don't go here if you dislike being ignored."}
{"text":"I love this place more and more each time I visit! I've been here 2x since my original visit and I'm SO impressed with the beer list. There are over 100 beers and every single one I've tried has been amazing. I had a nitro stout a few weeks ago and today I had a neapolitan beer and a s'mores beer. Both were delicious. I was also impressed to see my favorite cider from Finnriver on the list!

We came today on Father's Day and they were giving away a free order of Pretzel Nuggz for fathers! My dad and husband were in tow so we got 2 free orders. They were absolutely delicious and went really well with the cheese sauce. In addition to the Pretzel Nuggz, I ordered a delicious stuffed Stella Blue. I'm really picky when it comes to burgers and I thought it was amazing! To finish, I got the peanut butter porter pie, which was a little cold but good.

I can't wait to come back, especially during happy hour after seeing their happy hour specials. Would definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Over 100 taps. (I feel like I heard somewhere between 125-130 but I didn't count). That's all I needed to hear to be sold on this place. As you can imagine with that many craft beers, there's truly something for everyone here. I love the Local 30 as a great way to try out smaller, local breweries that you might not be as familiar with, but you'll also see some bigger names, both nationally and within the state. And I think it makes for an excellent selection!

So far, the staff has been very friendly and willing to make suggestions, which is helpful with a beer list of this size. The space is very roomy, although on a Saturday night it still gets crowded...not packed, but might not be able to find a seat at the bar. Seems like a decent place to do anything from watch a game (they've got plenty of TVs set up) to meet up with some friends to have a chill dinner.

The crack fries are great. The mac and cheese is great. The burger was the one part of the whole experience that didn't really measure up for me. Not bad, just truly nothing special, unfortunately. Overall, I would put this at more of a grab a drink and a snack place than somewhere I'd want to get a meal, but that's just me.

Oh, and during happy hour, half-off the Local 30! That means you can get a quality craft brew for about $2.75, which is amazing to me."}
{"text":"Was visiting Madison over the weekend and we decided to stop in here for a quick bite and a beer. I like the name and the ambiance of the place. We ordered the Vladimir Poutine was delicious and went very well with our beers too. I'd come back here if I'm ever in Madison again."}
{"text":"When I go out with friend drinking on state street I always hope with end here. The are so many drinks to try, the food is great, and the wait staff is always friendly regardless of whether we came in for a meal or just drinks and apps. The fries are great, but I really love their purrfectly round pretzel bites with cheese. I feel like a cat as I bat them into the cheese. lol"}
{"text":"First of all, my friend and I come here every year to eat the MAGNIFICENT crack fries (get the cheese sauce). She comes from Cincinnati just for the fries.

But this year.. our service as exceptional! Fernando was an amazing waiter and made sure we felt welcome and kept checking in with us. This guy really understands the hospitality biz! Keep killin it dude!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I've been to the one in Grand Rapids so to see one open here in Madison was so exciting! 130 taps! My Husband waited in line and was #63 to get a free order of crack fries a week for a year! 

There is something for everyone on both beer and food menu. The staff is very friendly and the decor is well thought out and Madisoncentric (is that even a word?)!

Located near an essential parking lot... since it's practically on the busy State Street.  No reason or excuse should keep you and the family from stopping in to enjoy a nice relaxed atmosphere. 

CHEERS!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The service is top notch and the menu is great. I held a retirement party here and it was no problem for the restaurant to take a reservation, offer separate checks, and deliver excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Airy and colorful space to chill or be chilled. Love those fries!"}
{"text":"No excuse for luke warm chili. Crack fries? Please.  Cracked pepper on french fries - bfd.  Great beer selection - rating the food only. Not good enough."}
{"text":"Looking to watch the game and drink lots of beers but not stand in line all day or deal with a bunch of underage college kids? This is a good place for you. This place is big and open, plus an upstairs area too. The sheer amount of beers on the menu is very impressive and you can do small pours to sample more. The food is good too for bar food. Some really interesting things on the menu like crack fries, and Vladimir poutine! Good for socializing and large groups of sports and beer enthusiasts. Gets a little loud inside though."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, I like how they list there beers. The pretzel nuggets are so delicious.

So I'm editing my review because even though they have lots of beer and the pretzels are good, the customer service SUCKS. Even at the bar, been waiting over 35 min for a new beer, with 4 plus bartenders working. Even asked one of them for a sample of a beer and never came back to take another beer order.  People right next to me at the bar have been here close to 50 min and never approached once, pretty sure they are writing you a shitty review at this moment also. I would take a second look at how you can train your bartenders to have a more functional strategy when serving your customers. 

3 bartenders, 1 on one side, the 2nd on the other, 3rd taking care of servers drinks. That way they all have there own \"section\" instead of them running around the bar with there heads cut off confused and not sure who they should be taking care of next. You have sections for servers have sections for the bartenders also."}
{"text":"This place is huge! So many beers and so little time to sample them all, so of course I will be back. The bartender was very friendly and attentive, despite the crowd. Fun place to dip in and enjoy some quality craft brews!"}
{"text":"I went here with a client on a weekday during lunch. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and very friendly. The buffalo chicken sandwich was spicy and delicious! I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys setting their taste buds on fire. 

If you are an avid beer drinker I would recommend this place for their extensive beer list."}
{"text":"Going to Slayer tonight some friends n I decided to try this place out before the show. THE BEST BURGER AND CRACK FRIES I'VE EVER HAD. Go there. I promise you'll love it. Service was a tad slow but it was very busy. Great atmosphere and vibe. I'll be back many times!!"}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre food and drinks. I've been twice for events and have not been overly impressed."}
{"text":"I really can't say enough good things about this restaurant and bar. The beer selection- over 130 taps- is enormous and always changing. I usually try a sample or two before making a selection. I like this bar because it provides a refreshing break from the cheap party-type campus bars. They feature plenty of beers from Wisconsin, the rest of the country, and many from abroad as well.

The food is also very good. The burgers are not the best I have had in Madison, but good nonetheless. But they are served with Crack Fries, which are aptly named."}
{"text":"This place is hugeee ;). I love the wall art and graffiti all around the walls. Not that I drink beer but they have huge beer selection, over a 130 beers on tap. They have TVs all around,  booths, ample bar seating, two bar one on the first floor and one on the second floor. For us non beer fanatics they do have a full on bar and a large food menu. Service was on point and overall this place has a great vibe. Whether you wanna catch a game or spend some time catching up with some buddies this is the spot to be ( love the spacing). Enjoy the pics and videos ;)

Definitely have had a great time everytime I have came here ;)"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, and best gaddamn fries in sconsin. Nice staff, friendly service, the don't leave you with an empty glass for long. Nice upgrade from Quaker Steak, the previous owner."}
{"text":"Hopcat is great. It is huge, there is too much beer, and the fries are good. that's it. That is all I will ever go to Hopcat for, and I'm ok with that. I'm not a fan of the food I've tried from the menu; burgers,schnitzel, wings and such. but thats ok. I know what I want when I go to Hopcat, and it's great."}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing the beer/bar aspect of the place.  I think they do a good job.  And the bartenders seem like they do their homework.  It's in a good location for me.  I've stopped here a couple times on my way home, since it's right on State St. I can catch a ton of buses.  Man I really like that we live in an era where there's sort of an arms race between beer bars to get as many beers on tap as possible.  Us customers are winning."}
{"text":"Meh.  The burger was good, but the bun thick and dry.  Good value for happy hour, but I wouldn't pay regular price for it ($12).  Fries were decent but nothing special, not \"crack\" like they claim. Friendly and attentive staff.  Don't know who is in charge of the music, but that person might be on crack.  One minute awesome 80's alt rock, the next really awful mellow 70's, the next minute The Killers.  Pick a theme and go with it, don't try to please everyone.  Four stars for happy hour, two stars for regular prices and music."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in here with our family to try it out for lunch.  We were very happy we did.  This place is a very large open resturant with awesome wrap around style booths.  We were greeted by friendly staff.  We were shocked to see hundreds of beers to choose from on the menu.  75-100 beers on tap maybe???  You get 2 free samples per person.  I waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and the beers. We all tried different food items.  My son had an amazing BBQ PULLED pork sandwich on a thick Texas toast with slaw and Crack fries.  My wife had the quesodillo which was wonderful.  Myself I tried the street tacos.  I would reccomend the flour tortillas over thier corn.  Corn was a little  tough.  But the tacos were good and filled with flavor.  Quesodillo was the best.  Along with the Crack fries.  
My wife and I thought this would be an awesome place for just the two of us to come to watch a major sports game and relax with some friends.  Great place to drink beer that for sure.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"If your face has been good to you lately, treat it well. Bring it here to pour beer in it and eat great food. Awesome mix of music across decades will have everyone groovin."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection. Not a very good burger. Good apps (i.e. Fries with cheese). Nothing spectacular besides the awesome beer selection. Would return for apps n beer, nothing more (I would only return at the insistence of friend or colleague). Overpriced as well. Many better places to go in Madison than Hopcat."}
{"text":"Great place to try some beers you've never heard of, and get this, they have a late night happy hour! Granted I'd have to nap prior to taking advantage, but Sunday-Wednesday from 10p-close they have their normal happy hour deals!"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times since opening last summer and each time I have not been impressed with the service. Every server I've had hardly stops by the table once our orders have been placed. They don't seem very attentive and tend to be quite forgetful on several occasions. While the food has been decent, wait times have been longer than normal even when the restaurant seems rather slow."}
{"text":"My little brother suggested we go here because in his exact words \"The Crack Fries are lit.\" And they did rank impressively high last year either in Madison or nationally, according to our server. So we came to see what the hype is all about. 

What we discovered: Crack Fries are seriously the JAM. I don't know what exactly makes them so good, but they totally live up to their reputation. 

We stopped by at 7:30ish and the place is packed with a 30-45 min. wait for a table, but they text you when your table is ready so you don't necessarily have to stay on premises.

Enormous beer list and variety of beers on tap. They also have some killer cocktails if that's more your thing. 

To sum up: CRACK FRIES"}
{"text":"Came in on a weekend for lunch with my wife. Service was a bit slow for food but there were a lot of people there. I started with some Crack fries, which were tasty and came with a super thin watered down cheese sauce, basically too thin to actually adhere to the fries, but it has a decent flavor. It came with a thick skin on the top which probably means the dish them out into the little ramekins and let them sit for a long while.

I ordered a BLT which took about 15-20 minutes to come out and the waiter asked If I wanted the same cheese dip which comes free with the fries. I said yes and he didn't mention any extra charge, and I didn't see one on the menu anywhere. 

The BLT came out and the bread was more of a crouton then toasted. Obviously the bread either started out completely stale or sat on the flattop for the entire 15-20 minutes. It cracked and broke more like a cracker then bread. Bacon was a bit tough.

When the bill comes the BLT is charged as 11.20 instead of 9.95. So either the amount is wrong in the computer or they just charged me 1.25 for some runny cheese sauce, I still had some left over from my fries anyways!

Fries were tasty, BLT was horrid. Overcharged or upcharged without notice."}
{"text":"5 stars for the beer - 2 stars for their food.
There is no other place in Madison with the huge selection of beers that HopCat has, but they also run out quite frequently so pick 2-3 that sound good in case your waiter/waitress comes back to let you know they're out.

I have been here on two separate occasions. The first time I ordered the grilled cheese, which came with a tomato soup. It was an average grilled cheese, the cheese wasn't melted in the middle but there was tons of cheese! The second time I ordered their sloppy joe, which had their cheese sauce on top - not a fan and fries and jalapeños in the middle. If I hadn't known I ordered a sloppy joe I would have thought I was eating some big mush gravy fries burger. My friend ordered their cheeseburger, which didn't taste spectacular. 

Service wasn't great either. On a Sunday night with only four tables it took half an hour to get beers and another hour for the food, total of an hour and a half.

Plenty of other bars nearby with good quality food and beers on tap if you're looking for a party in your mouth of some good mouthwatering food that you'll actually crave to come back for."}
{"text":"This is the kind of bar that I just really love. They pay homage to the great brews of Wisconsin, the food is hella good, and the service is spot on.

Don't be scared off by the fact that this is technically a State Street bar, the feel inside is totally different. The feel of this place is certainly more upscale. I really love the booths and tables they used, very comfortable and classy. 

The food was decadent. The husband and bro in law both had ginormous burgers and I had a southwest salad with crack tots. I was a lil confused by the tots at first, because they are shaped like mozzarella sticks, I was considered they wouldn't have cooked well that way. I was mistaken though and they were perfectly crisp, just like I want my tots to taste.


The beer...oh the heavenly beer. There really is something for everyone. I myself venture toward the sweet side and found a local Madison Cherry Mead on tap as well as a Raspberry Kombucha beer that was outta sight. Really impressed by the variety!

Lastly, the service couldn't have been better. Our waiter was attentive, and everything came out to us in a timely manner.

This will definitely be my go to bar when I'm downtown!"}
{"text":"Love the crack fries, had the load ones also. New place  here ftom indiana came out to see some friends he has the free fries for a year card."}
{"text":"Great selection of taps, and a great way to cede tea as well.  Service was super friendly and attentive without being overly attentive.  Bartender who helped us was amazing!"}
{"text":"Good food, on the salty side. Large portions, fair prices. All around above average in its price class."}
{"text":"So many beers on tap it's nutterbutters! I'm consistently impressed with the range of beers and the knowledgeable bar tenders who are always able to recommend a great beer. 

The space itself is huge; 2 wide open floors with a giant wrap around bar and lots of booth and table top seating. It's a great place for a large group, especially around happy hour and is unique in that it is one of the few bars that consistently has enough space for a group gathering, which is great!

Other than large parties, the space feels a little large and overwhelming for a smaller group. The crack fries get a lot of hype, and they're pretty decent, but neither the fries nor other food (burgers, apps) really stands out as anything special."}
{"text":"The staff knows there beer. Good place to hang out and the food was excellent. Would go back to this place. They also have sour beers on tap. Wish I love sour beers and not to many place care that so it was a nice treat."}
{"text":"Hopcats are kinda formulaic and generic in terms of themselves in relation to their own locations (chain based) but they do a great job with their rotating taps and local sections for beer and a lot of the food is good. I would highly recommend the Kitchen Sink (vegetarian option), the meat head pizza egg rolls, and the burgers! This place is known for carding hard and it is a little more expensive (so its great for people looking to escape the \"young\" student crowd around state street). Great atmosphere/ambiance to go with a group to enjoy good conversation. There is no dancing, and they highly regulate the raucousness of acceptable behavior. 


Full menu served all night, great late!"}
{"text":"Top flight beer selection.  Colorful roomy place. Great bar set up. Bartenders on a Saturday afternoon excellent and know what they serve. Fries are as special as advertised!  Great with a beer!"}
{"text":"The Vladimir Poutine was sooo good! It is not for the light of heart... and probably not for one person alone. The beer was also delicious...a great selection and the waiter was very knowledgeable about each one. I wished I had room for the dessert at the end of dinner...I will have to return with that as my focus."}
{"text":"They have really great food, and if you want a steal, enjoy happy hour and their specials. Great food, great service, and cool atmosphere. A must try!"}
{"text":"Best chili I've had from a restaurant!! Had just enough heat and they weren't stingy with the beef."}
{"text":"Daaaamn Gina. I am so addicted to those crack fries. They taste like cracked black pepper but they addict me like crack cocaine. And you know me! I love that yayo. Yayoooo.

I also love me some pretzel nuggz cuz I gotta get some nuggz up in this mug. Mmmmmm yeah.

And and and my bae she loves that Muffin Top vegetarian sandwichez. She's gotta get that vegantarian shit because I'm not fucking with no faatties.

So I'm impressed and like, you know I had to tell all my boys here on Yelp because, gotta hit it. Get all up in this bitch cuz HopCat is the heat.

(There was a really smart, pleasant bartender who worked here and knew a lot about beers. God save his soul. Or at the very least, please let him get a job at the myriad of other good craft beer bars in this city.)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the grand opening to sample the crack fries and peruse the awesome beer list. The crack fries are delish- covered in black pepper and salt and served with a smooth cheese sauce. I tried the Fuel Cafe on tap. If you like coffee and beer, you'll like this one.

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised when a manager approached us to give us a promotional card for free crack fries every week for a year. We had heard they were giving these out, but it was our anniversary and we didn't want to wait in the long line.  We couldn't stop laughing after we ended up with a card after all, 3 hours after they opened.  Thanks for the great time! 

One last note- I recommend sitting upstairs. There is a beautiful view of the Capitol building."}
{"text":"SO MANY BEERS ON TAP! This is a must stop for any craft beer lover. We were lucky to come right after a Founder's takeover, and they still had some of their beers available. Since we came in on a Saturday afternoon, there were plenty of seats at the bar. We tried:

[Founders Nitro Oatmeal Stout, Founders 2015 Kentucky Breakfast Stout (5 oz Sniffer/$5.50), Founders 2016 Kentucky Breakfast Stout (5 oz Sniffer/$5.50), Saugatuck Brewing Nitro Neopolitan Milk Stout Taster (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Sm4chLI_Df5lEL0x2v1aNg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg)]

-Founders Nitro Oatmeal Stout: Super smooth but not a lot of flavor. I wouldn't get this again.
-Founders 2015 Kentucky Breakfast Stout (5 oz Sniffer/$5.50): Yum! You can taste the barrel age on this, and it's nice and smooth. 
-Founders 2016 Kentucky Breakfast Stout (5 oz Sniffer/$5.50): Also good flavor but needs a bit more age on it. There was a slight harshness on the finish.
-Saugatuck Brewing Nitro Neopolitan Milk Stout Taster (Nitro Milk Stout w/Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry): Definitely unique- this beer smells and tastes like strawberry, but I'm not sure how much I could drink of this. Worth trying once. 
-Bells Brewing Java Stout (American Stout w/Coffee): Just ok. It had good coffee flavor, but wasn't as good as other java stouts I've had. 

They also serve food here, and I would definitely be back if back in Madison. Our bartender was excellent, and super accommodating with giving samples of the beers and also recommendations. Parking shouldn't be bad during the afternoon since there is street parking available."}
{"text":"Can you go wrong with 130 taps?  Probably not.  They have a list of 30 locals and the remaining 100 are a variety from around the world, even including a section with gluten free and kombucha options.  Taps change frequently, as two new ones came on board during our dinner there.  I like that you can order smaller volumes.  Some of the Belgians are a little pricier than other establishments.

After reading other reviews, I was terrified that my (legitimate) out-of-state ID would be confiscated, but it was not.

The bartenders are friendly, but I think the service is inefficient as it takes a while to get a beer.  The food arrives quickly, but getting the food order in takes a long time.  Also, I ordered the poutine without onions (it was delicious!) but it still came covered in scallions.  The menu said the poutine came with caramelized onions but not scallions.  I would suggest including scallions in the menu description if the item comes covered in them.  Onion-haters will be thankful.

The atmosphere is very... non-traditional.  The side walls are covered in very colorful graffiti-type painting.  There are many TVs.

Hopefully they get out their \"we just opened\" jitters and the service at the bar is faster in the future."}
{"text":"Two words: CRACK. FRIES. We went through about 3 orders of them in one night!

This is a fun place if you want to eat and drink with a great variety of beer options including a good number of local beers! Our server was helpful and service was quick."}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of diners because of that weird, oily residue feeling that I get - like it feels like there is a layer of grime that coats my face and hands. Just me? Anyway, HopCat sort of reminds me of a diner, but a cleaner, spacious, Pub-y, more modern version. Red booths. Graffiti on the walls. Huge bar. I dig it. 

There were a few \"signature\" items on the menu like the \"Crack Fries,\" \"Bar Zee\" burger, \"Vladimir Poutine,\" Southwest Salad and others. But, I ordered the Cowboy Burger because of the spicy fried jalapeños and pepper jack cheese. Burgers were above average, nothing amaze, but... FIVE POINTS FOR GRYFFINDOR because those fried jalapeños are EVERYTHING. They are ACTUALLY spicy! It also has some great seasoning on it too! Really tasty! The only con is that I received a measly 3 slices. No worries, I ordered pickled jalapeños on the side (also, actually spicy and amazing). They should have the fried 'penos as an actual appetizer. FYI: my burger actually came medium which is what I asked for. 

All burgers come with cracker fries - the. best . fries . ever. They are not overly greasy/oily. They are not burnt. They're skinny, SLIGHTLY crisp, and generously seasoned with extra somethings other than salt and pepper. I had mine with their cheese sauce, ORDER IT. It's not overwhelmingly rich, but it's creamy and pairs well with the fries. So good. I definitely recommend the Crack Fries and cheese! 

Beer selection is amazing - lots of selection. To my surprise, they had a huge Stout selection. They were empty of the two stouts that I was interested in though (Nitro Milk Stache and Fiddler Stout.) Apparently, they are the two bestselling (obvi) stouts. I ordered a Tap Jockey which I really liked though! It was a nice, light bodied Stout - easy to drink, light intensity. 

Service was good, but I did feel a bit rushed. Food and drinks came out at a decent time. They were short-staffed (day after Christmas), so I didn't mind. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for casual beer and bar food with friends!"}
{"text":"You might be thinking... A black bean burger on an English Muffin? Do it. Get the Muffin Top Burger. It's the only muffin top you'll ever enjoy. I can also see why HopCat's crack fries are top 10 in the country. Add the cheese. You will be dipping everything in it."}
{"text":"My wife researched this place for my birthday and did a great job. Their selection of beers was excellent, and the first thing they do when you sit at the bar is furnish a menu of beers with all the prices, sorted by style. They have a \"local 30,\" which changes frequently, but a lot more than 30 local brews -- and even some from true micros like Hop Haus is Verona. Their menus are so up to date they print them twice a week and put stamps on them during each day when the upcoming list fills out or they run out (with a cute \"No beer for you\" stamp).
The bar is very social -- it's long and wraps around tge taps ( but is not blocked by them), so you can see pretty much everyone there. The bartenders were very social, too, especially Jesi, who took care of us like she was hosting us at a party. She would walk by, scanning the area like a lifeguard and then stop and chat whenever we wanted, answering every question thoughtfully, whether it was about the beer, the yummy \"crack fries\" (which she recommended we not have plain), the Packers or her day job. They always had plenty to do but had enough people not to be over busy. 
Wonderful experience overall. Was there good food? Probably. But we didn't care. There were a ton of tables and there's a wait on weekend nights, so I'm sure it was good. But that's not what we came for, nor should it have been."}
{"text":"Holy beer bar!  So many to choose from, many with witty names and from local breweries.  I stuck with Belgian ales - creamy and delicious.  Food here is pretty darn good - lots of variety and tasty as heck."}
{"text":"Fun place, good crowd, cheap beers....what's not to like"}
{"text":"I loved their crack french fries. They had a pretty good selection of craft beers as well. It was a Sunday night and rather quiet but the service at the bar was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Ah! Madison needed a place like this! A beer lovers paradise! This may be my new haunt. SO. MANY. TAPPERS! They are also great at repping the local microbreweries! The variety is also great and they of course have mini glasses... so it's basically an endless, build your own flight if you wish.

Crack fries were yummy but I'm not sure i was a ga ga for them as everyone else. Don't get me wrong, they are mighty tasty, peppery with a hint of sweetness and a delish cheese sauce for dipping; but with a reputation like that, i expected them to blow my mind.

My mussles however... the best I have ever had! You get a ton! Seriously, they are not shy about the portion. the sauce is made of spicy chorizo, a light tomato broth, onions and a sprinkle of heaven.  Served with buttery bread. MMMM! My husband got their fish and chips. He was underwhelmed claiming there was more breading than fish. I tried a small piece of fish and found it to be light, fluffy, and flakey. I enjoyed it and question his taste buds. 

Decor is seriously cool. People are encouraged to carve into the tables. I worry when beer is involved and people are encouraged to vandalize property; however, Madison is keeping it pretty classy. I did attempt to turn every hashtag into a game of tic tac toe. 

Service was great and friendly. Not sure how knowledgeable the staff is regarding the beer selection as I didn't ask any questions. She did praise my choice of the mussels so I think they are pretty competent. 

We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"It's always busy -- and for good reason.  The food is great, the tap list is stunningly big, and the service is awesome.  When we can get in, HopCat always makes the list."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to review this place since my gluten free limitation only allowed me to drink here. The local cider was great, and on a happy hour special.

The rest of my group got the \"crack fries\", and said they lived up to the name! I'd recommend trying them if you can, but the drinks, decor and service all worked for me."}
{"text":"Fabulous drink selection. Especially love the crack fries and the pretzel bites. Both some of the most outstanding fries and pretzels I've ever had, if not the best. However, for where their beer menu is great their food menu besides the appetizers is kind of mediocre. I say this because I wish that they had more vegetarian/ vegan options other than your classic salad. Slightly overpriced. Great place to go with a group of friends for a casual evening over some unique brews."}
{"text":"We went here for a drink and ended up back the next day for the food. 

The fries are in fact crack. I have no idea what is in them, but you cannot stop eating them. I expected this to be pure hype and that quickly dissipated as I began to eat my Wife's portion. 

The tater tots are very Dutch Croquette style and also phenomenal. 

We had the Barnyard and Patty Melt as entrees, but after the fries, tater tots, and 4 different rounds of local beers it was hard to stomach. Patty Melt was nothing special, but the Barnyard was incredible.

Basically eat here. I hate sports and will put up with it often to partake in tasty brews and food. I will knock it up a star if they flip it to the BBC or something for me every so often."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers, fries, beers and games. You must try the crack fries here because it is amazing and no where else make it this good. There is a huge variety of beer on tap and a lot of big screens so you can watch any games you want."}
{"text":"Hopcat has been open for more than a year and I've avoided it for fear of shitty bar food. I'm sad it took me so long to stop in because it's awesomeeeeee. The Bloody Mary I ordered was classic, delicious perfection. The highlight of the meal was definitely the tacos- I got the tilapia tacos in a corn tortilla. They come with a unique, sweet coleslaw, avocado slices and a spicy sauce. The fish was lightly fried in oil, which brought out the freshness so wonderfully (usually fish tacos are breaded and fried, and they lose so much flavor that way). The avocado was fresh and cooling, and the hot sauce added the best kick- even though I used it sparingly! I would highly recommend this dish for fish lovers and taco lovers alike. Go to Hopcat and take me with."}
{"text":"Forgotten crack fries, hair in our entree, and not a cent deducted from the bill or even a manager apology. Get it together Hopcat. The novelty of your arrival will soon rub off once people see that the food and service is subpar.

The beer selection is good though. Maybe they count on people being buzzed/drunk and not noticing how bad everything else is."}
{"text":"Such a great place! The food was excellent and the beer was even better. Our server Allen was a great help and picked out a beer for all 3 of us! I would suggest this place for anyone who wants good food, good beer, and good vibes!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty good time at HopCat drinking beer and eating mussels...until I got the bill.

I went there on a Monday and got half off on mussels -- this was a pretty good deal, around 9 bucks for a full order. The mussels were tender and plentiful.

However I split a pitcher of Milwaukee Brewing Company Booyah Farmhouse Ale, a $9 a six-pack solid beer. They charged a whopping $21.50 for the pitcher. You can buy the same pitcher at the Memorial Union for $14.

If you're rolling in dough, I would recommend HopCat to try some rare beers on tap, otherwise, plenty of other establishments around Madison sell similar beers for a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"First off, I resent standing in line when there's obviously a lot of empty tables that you can see from the window while you're waiting. The bouncer/door men can be a bit uppity. Beyond that, they do have a great beer list, but I've never suffered from a poor beer menu around here.

The foods all sound really good, but they don't quite measure up to their descriptions on the menu.

I don't dislike this place, but there are just so many great places around here that I'd rather spend my money. I don't think it's worth waiting in line over, and I don't see the mystique."}
{"text":"I tired this place for the first time and I loved it. I'm excited that they have other locations so I can easily find a way to return. If you're not already aware, their big thing is carrying 130 different kinds of beer on tap! I'm not a big beer person but they also have several different ciders. What I was very excited about is their raspberry Framboise. It was a little pricey, but it came in a fully poured snifter glass. 

Aside from their drinks, their menu is filled with a lot of interesting appetizers and entrees that have you torn on what to pick. I split the Vladimir poutine fries (which came with mini pierogies), a grilled cheese and apple sandwich, and the mac and cheese. Everything was great. My friend got 2 soups: the cheese ale and whatever tomato soup that came with her grilled cheese. They were the only things I didn't enjoy. 

I would definitely return to try more drinks and food!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, wide beer selection. Order the crack fries and wings, skip the mussels."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers including a pretty nice local list. I was a little disappointed with the slow service. We were a party of 10 and were always waiting for our server to refill drinks/put in more food orders. 

We most likely would have stayed longer and spent more if the service was a bit more attentive."}
{"text":"Great beer list, but their food is gross. I went with 5 other people, and we ordered a wide range of items from all areas of the menu. Several dishes were inedible. Their appetizers were okay, but super pricey for the portion. The crack fries are seriously overrated. I have no desire to return to HopCat considering all the other options in town with killer beer menus and way better food. Bummer."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers on tap.  I would suggest coming here during happy hour for half price off beer and burgers.  Honestly, the crack fries are nothing spectacular, but they seem to market them like they're the best thing in the world.  The servers seem to know nothing about any of the beers they have on tap, but the bartenders seem pretty knowledgeable.  If you're sitting on the first floor, it's not really a great place to watch sports because the TV's are far away.  The second floor is much better."}
{"text":"This place was A-OK. 

The good: 
- wide selection of beers, including very funky ones,
- pretty darn good veggie chili,

The A-OK:
- the pork schnitzel: date was impressed, I found it to be just as expected - not outstanding, but not bad either. 
- atmosphere is pretty cool - I would describe it to be in the same ballpark as buffalo wild wings, but B-dubs is Bears and Hop Cat is Packers. 

The bad: 
- Vladimir poutine- The dumplings were stale. 
- The beer descriptions- The Triple Goddess Raspberry kombucha SOUNDS like it may sweet with a hint of the kombucha vinegar taste, but being a kombucha it has the potential to taste exactly like vinegar with a dash of sweet. So I asked the waitress about it, and she said it was very sweet; sweet with a hint of vinegar taste sounds delicious to me, so I ordered. What came was not sweet in ANY sense of the word, and the vinegar taste was overwhelming. Perhaps I got what I deserved ordering a kombucha, but I did feel a bit mislead by the waitress. Outside of that, the service was pretty friendly. 

Recommendation: 
- Sit at the bar, ask for beer recommendations from the bartender, and stay away from the Vladimir poutine (I heard the uncomplicated crack fries are good though)."}
{"text":"The best tap selection in Madison. They host a lot of great craft beer events. If youre a craft beer enthusiast, Hop Cat is all you need."}
{"text":"Okay, HopCat, color me impressed. HopCat you can be my best Madison beer friend with extra benefits. You promised so much, and I was left skeptical. Your offerings were written like a profile on eHarmony. Everyone lies on those a little bit so I assumed not everything you said could be true! 

HopCat lives up to the hype that has been blasting throughout Madison social media. If you love beer, this bar is THE place in Madison for you to check out.

I didn't even on plan on stepping in on your grand opening, but it just happened to work out. I had a friend from out of town visiting, and we were hanging out at the Capitol. We decided 3:00 would be a good time for a brew so we stopped by HopCat to give the new place a shot.

When we walked it, it was completely packed. I was quite interested in trying out the new beer house in town so I was willing to wait the 30 minutes that was apparently needed for a table because they were so slammed. Well, the table only took about 5 minutes so I'm not going to complain there!

When you first walk in, you are going to notice the massive floor plan and giant bar on the ground floor, as well as, the giant staircase that leads up to more of this giant beer house. The second floor is about half the size of the first, maybe a little smaller. The bar is significantly smaller than the one downstairs. The main bar has 130 beers on tap from around the country and many more in bottles from around the world. The upstairs bar has 30 local beers on tap. My tip, if you're impatient is to order local beers if you're seated upstairs. If you like trying new things like me, you won't mind the slightly longer wait for a beer to be transported from downstairs.

Did I mention that there are 130 beers on tap? Well, there are, and I am truly impressed by the diverse, well organized beer list that has been assembled. The list even includes a key that educates the customer about glass type and size. I truly did not feel overwhelmed, despite the number of beers, because the list was well curated. MEGA props for pulling this off. I have felt overwhelmed with much smaller lists. The tap list was also dated so it appears that the list will be rotating frequently. I am happy to see this, although I doubt I will wear the current list out any time soon.

We were served two orders of \"crack\" fries with our beers. They were both free for the grand opening, but I'm glad that we got to try them because I'm not sure if I would have randomly ordered these. They were very good WITH the cheese sauce that the fries came with. The fries alone were slightly overpowering on the seasoning. There was A LOT of pepper and salt on them, but the cheese balanced out the seasoning. I would have liked to see a little more garlic and less pepper/salt to mellow the spices out a tad.

Our server was quite attentive. I jumped the gun a little bit by asking another server for waters because we hadn't received any. Our server came back with a 2nd set of waters as soon as he returned (oops). I am just assuming that they were so slammed this afternoon that he had a lot to juggle.

The atmosphere feels very trendy, and I appreciate the classic rock images plastered all over the walls. It's a little loud but not unbearably so for this type of establishment. I could still hear my friend at the table. The awesome classic rock mix playing over the sound system was greatly appreciated.

The management encourage that you carve into the table with whatever knife or other sharp object you brought with you. Do not assume the people before you are rude. Table carving is HopCat's trendy thing. Add a note!

HopCat, you're a CoolCat, and I would like to bring more of my friends over to try out what you're offering. I can see myself staking out a table for many hours to poke around your beer list some more. As a beer & wine drinker, I truly appreciate what the well curated list that you are offering this community. There is beer and mediocre tap selections everywhere in Madison, but I think I finally found a place that the proud beer lovers of Madison can call their home.

Keep up the good work. I'm honestly unsure how you made such a beer behemoth run smoothly. You are the Mussolini of beer (he made the trains run on time). Let's hang out again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Really cool beer selection. But besides the drinks, the food is mighty mediocre. 

I would not return here to eat but maybe for the drinks. I had the crack fries as well as the loaded crack fries. They boast that they're fries are one of the best in the nation but they are really just over salted fries and I've definitely had better.

I also tried their dessert which is a pretzel ball covered in chocolate and nuts. I really did not enjoy it but my family said it was alright. Then again I have never been a fan of pretzels."}
{"text":"Crack fries are great! Overwhelming beer menu, which if that's your think go ahead and stare at a menu for 15 minutes trying to figure out a beer you'll like. Lol"}
{"text":"Perfect burgers and amazing beer selection. Ask for Alejandro if he's working, spectacular bartender."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and never had a bad experience. Have sat at the bar sometimes and other times in a booth or table. Aside from the 30 local beers, the other 100 or so rotate out (I believe they only have a few kegs of each and when it's gone, it's gone). They often have some unique options that I haven't seen or heard anywhere else. The bartenders and servers have always been knowledgeable about the beers and have made good recommendations. The food is great, especially the crack fries of course, and the tacos are nothing short of life-changing. They also have good happy hour specials I'd encourage anyone to check out. Huge place, I personally have never had to wait for a table even on a Saturday night. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times.   The beer menu is the real attraction and it is good.   The food is just average...there's better bar/pub fare in Madison"}
{"text":"Don't try to organize a party here. There seems to be a distinct, almost intentional, disconnect between the person who takes your reservation for a large group and the manager whose one and only concern is profits. We had distinctly reserved and confirmed our reservation for the upstairs area, as we had a group of 30 for a birthday party. Promises were made and confirmed, but when we arrive we see an inconveniently long table in the middle of the ground floor. We try to ask for an explanation, first with our server and then with the manager, emphasizing that we were promised the upstairs space, but nope! it was \"too expensive\" to provide service upstairs, so they unilaterally closed it down. Apparently HopCat's word is as worthless as the toilet paper their bathrooms are stocked with. Our annoyance was then exacerbated by the fact that the server was pointedly demanding that we stay in our seats, because it would be \"too much of a hassle\" to have to figure out whose check belongs to whom. Server, we tip you precisely for the convenience of being served. It's your job to provide service and not to be annoyed at slight inconveniences. If we wanted to be ordered around, we'd go to the Soup Nazi. 

Despite the complete disrespect exhibited at every level of management, I am bumping up one star because their beer is fairly decent. Large selection, and they have a beer sommelier with whom you can work with to figure out what exactly you're in the mood for. I give credit where it is due, so good job \"beer snob\" (apparently that's his actual title)."}
{"text":"My husband and I aren't new to Hopcat, being from the Detroit area. This however, was the first time at the Madison location. We went for a couple of beers, no food, so keep that in mind when reading.

Saturday night, the day after Christmas, was the night. We had a table for two with a very knowledgable, friendly, and helpful server, Justin. He really knew a lot about his beers and did a good job recommending. If he was unsure about one, he told us honestly and asked a coworker. He helped make the experience great.

The decor was great with the graffiti. It was a very open and welcoming place. The atmosphere was relaxed, which is always refreshing. Checking this place out is a must!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly! Very helpful with the overwhelming beer menu. Service was quick."}
{"text":"Stopped in for my first time with my fiance on a Friday night the Badger basketball team was playing at home. Very busy and required a 10-15 minute wait, but luckily one of the best things about HopCat is there large beer selection. Bar tenders were helpful to pick something out me and my fiance would like while we waited for our table.

After getting a text and being seated in their upstairs bar area, we were in a slight rush to get to the game and the waiter was very quick and attentive. Ordered another beer but we were seated on the 2nd floor and they don't have their whole selection upstairs. 

In regards to the food, this is where I thought they lacked. We both ordered the Cowboy burger which was good. In regards to the \"crack\" fries, the seasoning was good but the fries themselves were overly crispy and in my opinion average. 

Overall, I would definitely go back. They have a good atmosphere and obviously lots of beer to choose from which is always great."}
{"text":"We were actually really glad that we didn't find HopCat until the last day of our Madison trip, as I'm pretty sure it would have been the only place we went. This way, we still got to enjoy the amazingness that it is, while experiencing other restaurants as well. The service was decent, nothing really to write home about. But! Next time we will make sure we are there for happy hour (2-6, M-F), which looked like an awesome deal.

First, the beer list. I'm sure everyone has mentioned it in as many reviews as they have. So many beers. Mostly local. Always rotating. So many types and breweries and lions and tigers and bears, oh my!

Second, the fries. I was skeptical (I mean, they're FRIES), and the hubs isn't even a fan of fries. So when the called them \"crack fries,\" I set myself up to be disappointed. I was not. Plus, they bring them out with a delectably creamy cheese sauce. If there isn't crack in them, I'm legitimately surprised. My advice would be to get the ones that DON'T come with stuff on them already. Part of the joy of these fries is their delightful crispiness, and I would hate to ruin that by making them soggy.

Our second appetizer arrived (because two people definitely need to eat two appetizers), and it somehow met and exceeded our lofty expectations after the fries. Fried pretzel balls. Gooey cheese sauce. Bacon. Jalapeños. Onions. No, that is not a list of the foods I could survive on. That's reality. That is the Loaded Pretzel Nuggz.

Finishing off the night, we ordered the BLT and the chicken wings. Both were awesome (there could have been a tiny bit more wing sauce and it could have used a little bit more of a kick). 

But honestly, I could just go and eat appetizers all day. Next on the list to try? Pizza wontons. Yeah, you read that right."}
{"text":"It's hard to give Hopcat a fair review without eating the entrees, but the beer selection was everything they advertise and more! 130 beers on tap and something for every taste! They even had my favorite  (Louis demise) which previously I've ONLY found in Milwaukee! We shared the crack fries as an appetizer and they were delicious. Atmosphere was very relaxed and service was great despite being very busy. We definitely will be back to try the entrees!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, beer selection, and service! We're from out of town, and came here because Yelp reviews were good and they tout Wisconsin's largest selection of craft beer on tap - 130 taps, to be exact. 

Totally by happenstance, we wound up there on a crowded college-football-Saturday, which is NOT our preferred atmosphere. But the staff was SUPER friendly, and not a single one of them seemed overwhelmed by the mad volume of people. 

Our server, Austin, was knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive, as was the bar staff and everyone else we had contact with. 

The food was creative and delicious, and the beer selection was HUGE. Couldn't have asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"Come here for the beer not the service or the food. My $6 cup of French onion soup was child size. We waited forever for our food (and the place was pretty empty). We requested ketchup and it never arrived. But--the beer is good."}
{"text":"HopCat is one of those places that I was highly anticipating it's arrival, but was not as impressed as I had hoped to be upon several visits. If you intend to visit for drinks only, you should have no problem finding something you *think* you might like from the beer menu. With so many options, you have to be okay with trying a new beer that doesn't quite taste as great as you imagined. Servers can help adjust expectations on beers that are particularly pungent. For example, the \"Bacon Bomb\" sounds like an awesome beer to order, right? When my friend asked for this beer, our server explained that the beer was overwhelmingly smoky (if that's your thing), and not as bacon-y as it would seem. This kind of menu knowledge from the service staff is very appreciated with such a lengthy and changing menu.

The food. I'm just not a fan. On one visit, I encountered a group leaving who warned us not to eat there, yet I did not heed this advice. After several visits that involved food orders, I can barely tell you what I've tried it was so unimpressive. The Muffin Top (black bean patty + english muffin + fixings) seemed to be a frozen MorningStar patty which did not offer much flavor for the price. The best menu item I've tried is the Turkey burger which was flavorful and nicely put together. 

TL;DR: Excellent service, fun atmosphere. Go for the beer, but find food elsewhere."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a rainy Halloween Saturday after the Badger's game.  Understandably, the restaurant was slammed but we were able to secure a few barstools at the ginormous bar.  We were at the bar for about an hour before deciding to order food and then waiting almost that long to finally receive it.  Service was painfully slow and there is no excuse.  A Halloween Saturday and a Badger game necessitates extra staffing, this wasn't the case here.  A big thumbs down to the female bartender (dressed as a TMNT) who looked at me (as I was trying to flag her down) and then simply walk away.  Yeah, it probably sucks that you are getting slammed but a simple acknowledgement is all that was needed. 
Already on the fence on whether this would be a place to visit more, this tipped me to the \"no\" side.  Besides almost the overwhelming selection of beer, poor service and a-ok food won't cut it for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic! All previous reviews were dead on! I asked the front desk of the Hampton Inn if they recommend this place and they said it was highly recommended by many guests. 

Great burger and crack fries. Washed it down with two beers. Great atmosphere on a rainy Tuesday night and service was very good! Being from Chicago, I highly recommend this place and I travel around the USA and eat out at many places! If in Madison, a must place to try if you like the local pub environment!"}
{"text":"Large selection of drinks. Came here on a busy Saturday night. It's a bustling dark bar area environment with a lot of good specials. There was something for everyone, which was great. The fries were good - heavy and loaded with toppings. 

Largest complaint was service. Saw waitress only twice or three times in several hours (took very long in between also and we couldn't properly order). In addition, she took a 40% tip for herself when giving me my change back. I didn't want to wait another long length of time/I was going to give them the tip anyways since I felt that they were maybe busy and understaffed and that was the reason for the slow service, but I think the tip should've been my choice. 

It's a large space though, and groups that do have the time."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection. Overwhelming actually. Crack fries are exactly what they claim to be. Enjoyed a quesadilla as well here."}
{"text":"Crack Fries are as amazing as everyone says they are! The beer selection is almost overwhelming and the burgers are hugeeeee!

COME HUNGRY!"}
{"text":"The crack frys are outstanding - must and cheese (on the side)!  The burgers are great!  Made with a mix of beef & brisket.  Just plain good.  I had the mushroom burger (medium) with a flight of three Belgium beers.  A great mix of flavors."}
{"text":"More a quantity over quality type place with seemingly 100 craft beer taps, but really only about 10-15 of interest. Probably 10 or so special releases and another 10 or so of tap-only local beers. The rest was just sort of \"fluff.\" However, this is at a much higher level than say Yard House.

Beers were served in proper glassware and slightly too cold for my tastes. Kegs seemed to be fresh for the most part. However, when you have a 100 tap system, keg rotation suffers and a lot of what is being served I'm sure is past its prime. I would certainly ask for a taster or splash before committing to a full pour of something pricey.

Fun, younger crowd and loud, darker atmosphere. 

The crack fries were out of control amazing. I would come back just for those. Did not have a regular meal here."}
{"text":"Love the beer selection. Bar tender asked what we liked and also suggested some new beers to try. They also offer free samples of beer. Food is good."}
{"text":"A great pub in a very convenient location between the Capitol and The UW Campus. Not a brewery, but you will never run out of beers to try-many from across Wisconsin and the Midwest behind their great big bar. Prices are right. Staff are enthusiastic about the beers and happy to help you choose a flight or a tasting. Perfect place to pop in when you're strolling the State Street mall or just finished your hike next to Lake Mendota. It's always been pretty busy with a whole array of characters when I've been. I suspect its the case most of the time."}
{"text":"I am fan! Went there for the first time last week and was very surprised about their 130 beers on tap of which a large amount are local. I like that they let you know with a stamp what they are out of that particular day.

The main reason we went was because we had an event nearby and we really wanted to try the crack fries and Vladimir putine.

the crack fries were delicious and we shared, so was the vladimir putine, amazing the best are the potato sacks within.

I had the mushroom burger and have to admit it was actually cooked how I like it. This is usually the hardest part of getting right. The pickles were good which is a big plus for me, and I finished all the fries which let's you know that it was good."}
{"text":"I'm not always a fan of State Street. But I'm definitely a fan of Hop Cat. So I will brave going down State St. to see what new brews they have on tap. There is always new stuff on tap and many that are rare finds. Once they had Central Waters Black Gold on tap which is their bourbon barrel imperial stout aged for 3 years that was incredible to get a chance to taste, nectar of the gods, it usually otherwise sells out so quick! 

They often have beer dinners, which is about 3 to 4 courses, each paired with a beer from the brewery they are showcasing that night. They are a fun way to get to know a brewery, the food is pretty good, and decently priced for what you get. 

I did go one day to have a 1/2 off burger which they have daily M-F from 2-6pm I believe are the hours. It is a great deal but I thought the burger was just okay, definitely not bad but not the best burger in Madison. The mac and cheese is pretty tasty and customization for toppings. They have other specials and deals throughout the week worth checking out. 

Some of the bartenders there are super knowledgeable. They will be able to find you something new and fun to try geared towards your tastes. Most beers you are able to get a sample of if you are deciding to get a pour unless it is a brew served in a snifter since those are already just 5 oz. 

I'm always excited to go to Hop Cat and try some new beers."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now for occasions varying from watching a lunchtime Packers game to hanging out at the bar for drinks to dinner. Service has continually improved since they've opened and the atmosphere has been consistently pleasant. The bathrooms are large and they make a concerted effort to recycle - the actual trash is small covered wastebasket and the main receptacle is for recyclable paper towel. A sign says that staff sorts the waste to make sure everything is going where it should. 

The main draw is the 130 taps they have; 30 are always local and 100 are up for anything. The menu is organized by type of beer, which is great at keeping it from being overwhelming. I hate IPAs, so I can breeze right past that part of the menu. The menus are stamped with what they're out of and also have an on-deck portion so you can see if there's something you'll want to stop back for in the near future. 

The food has been hit or miss. 
+ Crack fries: delicious, especially with the cheese sauce you get when you order them as an appetizer. On my most recent visit my server asked if I'd like cheese sauce with my entree, but it wasn't clear if it was included or if it'd be an up-sell. Not wanting to look like the cheapskate I am I declined the cheese but I should have just gone for it. I'm generally not a fan of beer-battered fries, but these are done well. 
- Cowboy burger: I've had it with both a subbed black bean patty and it's natural beef form and neither did it for me, especially not the beef patty. Generally this combo (BBQ, pepper jack, bacon) is totally my jam, especially with a black bean patty, but for whatever reason I just couldn't get into this burger on either occasion. 
+ Supper Club wrap: simple but also a lot going on. I ordered it without the fried egg salad and it was perfect for me. The flavors really balanced well and it made for a great lunch. I'll probably continue to explore the menu a bit but I'll keep this in my back pocket for the long term.
- Seasonal S'mores dessert: one of the worst things I've tasted, dessert-wise. I love the combination of chocolate and marshmallow, and when you add graham cracker I'm usually bowled over. I also order dessert maybe twice a year because I am usually too full to enjoy it immediately after dinner, so it was quadruply disappointing. The graham portion was fine, but it was topped with a chocolate beer pudding that was so bitter it tasted like I had chewed up an acetaminophen tablet. Horrible. I also had ordered it to go and it was originally brought to the table in a glass. The server took it back and scraped it into a box, but didn't include the toasted marshmallow. This was not too long after they opened, but the experience did put me off of going to HopCat for awhile.

As mentioned early in the review, though, service is much better than those first couple of months and I've found enough things to like to keep it in the rotation. I'm looking forward to trying brunch one of these mornings."}
{"text":"This place ,made me very happy. First off, they have a huge selection of micro brews. It was a very wide selection and diverse. Second, the food here was not your normal bar food it was a step above . I was worried when you walk in and they had reservations, now I see why. Great food, great beers , and awesome service. In a place of this size usually hard to get all three. I am happy to report they nailed it. I have a few tips here for ya so check the tips area. I am sure we will be back numerous times."}
{"text":"Hop Cat has tons of different beers on tap, some local (the Local 30) and others from all over the world. The burger I had, and the salad my friend had, were both good, as were the beers we got. Their crack fries really are quite addicting. The problem with Hop Cat is that it's definitely more expensive than pretty much every similar place in Madison. If you go to Hop Cat, don't get a beer that you could get somewhere else in Madison. Also, they don't allow people under 21 in the restaurant unless accompanied by a parent at all times of the day."}
{"text":"It always seems crowded here.  It has high ceilings and lots of space but still seems uncomfortably tight.  The downstair bar is big, but crowded.  There are lots of tables too, also crowded.  Did I mention it gets crowded here?  Upstairs bar is usually reserved for parties...at least it has been every time I've visited.

We started a 30th birthday bar crawl around 8pm Saturday and it was packed!  Standing room only at the bar.  The bartenders were pretty quick to get us or first drinks though so that's nice.

There are lots of TVs so it's good for sporting events...also lots of beer if you like that.  They have cocktails too, that's more my style.  I had the Woot! Russian...white Russian with root beer...tasty!

We didn't get food this time but I have in the past.  It's decent to high quality for bar food.  I've been with people who rave about the food here but I can't actually remember what I ate last time...and I remember food so that's saying something.

Parking is non-existent...to be expected downtown.  Your best bet is paying for a spot in one of the nearby ramps or surface lots.  If you find street parking you must have magical powers...will you be my friend?

I don't think I've ever used the restroom here...that's odd.  Sorry, I can't comment on the facilities.

All in all a nice bar but not a big draw for me.  It's just too crowded for this introvert."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for some dinner before a concert and was not disappointed.  The beer and food selection was plentiful with much variety.  The server I had, Alan, knew his beer like the back of his hand and even helped me pick out some great brews I would have never thought of trying.

The food tasted great, I just had a simple burger, but it was delicious.  And I can't recommend   the crack fries enough, especially with the cheese sauce."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a hip place to take friends for great bar food and excellent beer, HopCat is perfect. In my opinion, it's a step above many other typical, casual Madison bars in terms of selection, ambiance, and quality. 

The beer list is extensive, with a lot of great regional beers and ciders, and the bar food is great too. The Crack Fries are AMAZING if you love crispy fries, and you have to try it with the Wisconsin cheese sauce. Other than that, they serve up typical bar fare, like big burgers, sandwiches, and wings. There's something for everyone. 

Other than the Crack Fries, I really enjoy the mac & cheese, fish & chips, and the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich! 

If you're looking to give it a try, stop in during Happy Hour (M-Th 3pm-6pm) for half price burgers and $1.50 off local beers! It's a pretty good deal and there is never a wait during that time!"}
{"text":"I was just there for beer and appetizers and I really liked it.  The beer selection is amazing and those crack fries are exactly that...addicting.  I would go back there and eat those any time!  Amazing! Fun atmosphere and just a good place to relax and have a drink and some fries!  The service is very attentive as well."}
{"text":"Always a great selection of craft beer; as long as you like beer they will have one you will like! Staff is knowledgeable as well. 
Not to mention the food is to die for. Crack fries for the win! Also, never had veggie chili before, and I honestly couldn't tell a difference! So good. And last but not least, the Mac and cheese is forever amazing. Make your own with veggies and meats, smothered with an incredible cheese sauce. Whoever created this menu knows how to cater to college students for sure. But it really is for anyone!"}
{"text":"The food is tasty but salty. The service started out slow but has improved a lot since they opened. I really like the artwork and how spacious it is inside."}
{"text":"Pretty solid casual pub. Good selection of craft beers. 

The Crack fries are quite good.

I would give it another try, but there are so many competitors that provide this experience in the downtown area that I definitely wouldn't wait in line for HopCat."}
{"text":"I just went here to celebrate my birthday,  and when I walk in...  it was amazing.  The walls were covered in art,  the furniture was lovely,  the bar had so many variety's.  The bar menu was even larger than the food one.  There food was amazing and filling, and had amazing flavor.  The cider was great, so was the beer and the rest of the liquor.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"130 craft beers on tap..!! I'm not even a big beer fan and I loved it here. I even found a beer that I actually enjoyed and thats saying a lot. I also felt like the bartender has a lot of knowledge of different beers. Great place and would definitely come back to try their \"crack fries\"!"}
{"text":"HopCat is a chain, so if you've been to other universities where this place is prevalent, (UM, MSU, Kalamazoo college, etc), this  one will probably not hold your interest. However, if you've never been, anyone would tell you to go and try the Crack Fries... they're known for them.
And/or
If you have a bigger group, not too many Bar/restaurants in this area can seat you, thus this is your place.
So this is a fun-night-out-with-the-gang place... you're not having a foodie experience and you're not on a date.
All that said:  the burger, crack fries and beer experience is fairly reliable here and you can linger."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food, beer and atmosphere but the beer menu kept me from giving a higher rating. Stopped for a light lunch with my wife on a Thursday afternoon. We were looking for a place with a good beer selection and this appeared to be it. I'm not sure of the count but the offers on tap have to be close to 100 and they have bottles besides. Most are domestic and from many breweries I haven't heard of. (I would have liked to see a few more from Europe). The beer menu is organized by style and has a brief description and ABV which makes it nice. Prices are listed with the size/type of drink ware. Numbers in parentheses are listed in front of the beer in a seemingly random order which our waitress told us to ignore (?). So far so good. We like to order flights to enable us to share/try a small amount of a number of beers. They don't have flights but offer 3-5oz pours; that was ok. But here was our beef: the prices vary widely so there isn't a standard price for the selection of 3. To add to that confusion was our waitress had to come back twice telling us that what we selected was out (so 2 of the original 6 were not available). We were reasonably happy with the 6 we ended up with but it made for a fair amount of confusion and lost time trying to make a simple choice of 6 from the vast selection. To top it off the price of our pours ranged from $1.75-$8.75! For 5 ounces! I understand some of these brews are expensive because of the small batches, transportation, etc. but we thought that was quite a bit. Greater clarity on the menu about flights or \"small pours\", and keeping in supply everything on the beer menu would have made our experience much more pleasant.

Our water was not good - just drinkable. We couldn't agree on why it tasted bad; my wife said too many chemicals and I said it tasted like it came straight from the lake.

As far as food goes we each had the half sandwich/cup of soup lunch combo which was good and very reasonably priced at $7 (but not large portions).  The menu was unique to the restaurant and simple but still offering something for everyone. Basically a \"bar menu\" but with their own flair.

Ambience was \"modern with a 1970's flair\", if that's a thing. TV's on the wall (of course) but not overwhelming and the volume was turned low. The background music and wall art were somewhat eclectic with a slight sub-culture feel. Warm and inviting with unique curved booths that make group conversation easy. Clean and very open. A lot of money was spent furnishing this place.

Service was good overall; not great but no complaints. 

We won't write off HopCats yet but we're not in Madison that often so next time I'm sure we will try something new."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers, great crack fries. Love the beer selection but not sure if I love the seating setup."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous meal. Beer was great and really enjoyed the atmosphere. Stopped back the next day because the food was so good, but everyone had the same idea and the wait was too long. Not a problem. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"If rating only on the food, I would give three stars. But the huge selection of tap beer and great bar service bump these guys up to 4. Surprised they don't have nachos."}
{"text":"The menu is good and the beer list is amazing! As a vegetarian, I've only been able to try a few things on the food menu - mainly the appetizers - but I've never had something that I disliked. I'm a particular fan of the Classic Pretzel Nugz, but that's probably because I love a good cheese sauce.
The beer list features 30 local brews that come at a great price if you go on a Mon, Tues, or Wed after 10 pm. Definitely worth it. However, with 130 (I think) beers on tap, you'll find many more local brews that come at a more standard price. Basically, if you love beer, this is the place for you!

Now, the reason I gave it four stars is because this place is confusing. I have never had the same experience upon arrival, and I've been here more times than I care to mention. Sometimes they seat you, sometimes you seat yourself, sometimes they ID you three times, sometimes they ID you once, sometimes they have bouncers, sometimes they don't. I've also never seen the upstairs open, though it would clearly be the better place to sit. This would all be fine if they would have some sort of signage saying \"Seat Yourself\" or \"Please Wait to be Seated,\" but they don't. It's also difficult to tell who is a server/host because they don't seem to have a uniform, otherwise I'd just ask!

Other than initial confusion upon arrival, HopCat is great! Oh - and the decor is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great food and the fries were awesome. I love the local selection of beer.  the service was good and the bartenders really awesome people."}
{"text":"I didn't expect to like this place so much! I was originally turned off by the huge, collegey chain on State Street. However, the food is spectacular, the service is fabulous and the place is roomy and attractive. 

Everything I've tried tastes great. The crack fries are obviously great. The buffalo rolls are AMAZING. If you think Hopcat only serves good unhealthy food, think again. The southwest salad is delicious and fills you up.

Servers are always friendly and helpful. When it took more than a few minutes to get us our appetizers, they asked what they could comp because they felt so bad. We didn't even think we'd been waiting that long!"}
{"text":"Good was good. I had the fish sandwich. The three stars is mainly service time. Took almost 10 minutes to get a server to take our drink order. At present I'm sitting at the table having been waiting for the check for 10-15 minutes for the bill. Very slow service. Inattentive server. 

Beer selection is good though they were out of the cider I wanted to try. 

Might be back but would get better service at Coopers or Mr Brews."}
{"text":"Let me start here: Four stars solely for the food. Their crack fries are amazing and so is any other food item I've had there. I've always had great beer too and usually the recommendations are spot on. I like that they let you sample beer as well. However, the service leaves something to be desired. We were out celebrating one of my friends first day of classes and were told to seat ourselves. It was a good 10-15 minutes before anybody even acknowledged us even though there were only about 20 people there total including us. Our server never brought us water even after stating he would and the food took much longer than I ever remember it taking. From my previous experiences there, this is not out of the norm. Getting something as simple as water can take a long time and asking a couple of times before it finally happens here."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection, okay food but bartenders that are really bad at noticing when someone needs a drink."}
{"text":"I have yet to find what the fuss is about this place. I get they have a huge list of beer, but the staff has never made me want to return. I've been twice, the first time because I had to check it out (the bouncer was so rude, the bartender equally rude) The second because friends wanted to check it out. 

The selection is nice but there are a lot of places with a large selection are you really going to try a style you've never heard of? Or drink all the options? Probably not. 

If I'm going downtown I'd rather go to a local joint where the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great beer selection with 130 taps. When I was there, they were doing a March Madness bracket of IPAs. Not a huge IPA fan, but I was still able to find plenty to try. Seem a bit pricey, but a good place to check out. Flights are an option which is always good!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time in a while. Great beer as usual. Had some lava wings,which were pretty great."}
{"text":"Really good and I love the crack fries with the cheese sauce. It's a bit salty but still good. Great for groups and late night deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Was more than pleasantly surprised! I'm not a beer person, so I was hesitant when a friend suggested meeting up here. They have an extensive food selection and the staff was happy to sub things when needed! I worked as a bartender before and I was still pretty amazed at how knowledgable the staff is about their huge beer selection. One even found one that I liked for me! The mac n cheese was amazing and a very large portion! I would recommend going! Wish they had a few more options though for those who do not like beer, but it was still a wonderful dining experience with quick, amazing service!"}
{"text":"When I first stepped into HopCat, I was surprised by the huge space and good smell! Given the large neon LIQUOR sign and the general atmosphere, I assumed it'd be a rowdy college bar with bad food, but I was wrong! 

The crack fries here are no joke - definitely some of the best and most addicting fries I've ever had! I enjoyed the fish tacos a lot too, which is a common recommendation from other yelp reviewers. 

The service was pretty good considering the size of the place - it does get pretty packed on weekends but they can generally fit a large group in. This place has tons of big booth tables so any size party fits well here. 

Definitely recommend this place for some quality food and a nice bar if you're into that!"}
{"text":"I have this thing about overhyped places...I lose interest. So even though I initially was looking forward to HopCat...HypeCat... opening, I decided to wait until the masses were on to the next new thing. When I found myself downtown today, I popped in to check it out. 

What the heck...? Ok. So this place does everything right. Ambiance? Clean, well decorated and the perfect lighting and music levels (and every single song played was a favorite, during my entire visit). A singing waiter, who sang the whole time I was there (and thankfully in a good voice) is a clue that the staff enjoys being there. That sounds like it could be annoying, but it really wasn't. 

The downstairs bar is a huge U-shaped affair, and there was only one bartender working when I stopped in, but he handled everything well on his own. Calm, friendly, knowledgeable, and just attentive enough. Adam is a pro. I inquired about half pours of beers, and that indeed was an option. I tried two beers that were new to me, one of which Adam recommended, and it was much better than the one I picked on my own. Both were very good, though.

I had intended to only grab an order of the much-lauded crack fries for lunch, but then Adam informed me that all the tempting-sounding burgers were half price. I'm not sure what the hours or days of that special are, but I was there around 3:30 pm on a Thursday. I rarely ever order burgers, but I'd been in the mood for an old favorite, a blue cheese and mushroom burger. When I saw that was one of their special burgers, I couldn't resist. 

I'm gonna tell you guys, it was fantastic. It came with lettuce, tomato, swiss, and shoestring fried onions in addition to the mushrooms and blue cheese mayo. It was cooked exactly medium, just as ordered. It was a bit of a mess to eat, but they bring you plenty of napkins when it's delivered to your table. Or the bar, as it were. As I were...sitting at the bar. Crack fries are all they are hyped to be. Addictive. Everything was all I could want it to be. Corporate entity, yes, but you kind of forget all that once you fall under their spell of perfectly executed everything.

Two half pour-beers and a huge platter of delicious food came to twelve dollars and change. Amazing. I am a fan for life."}
{"text":"Not bad. Large open area and large walk around bar.  Acoustics are pretty good. Good happy hour prices to get you in the door and then good prices after 10PM. These 2 things will keep the college crowd coming in the door (and the money rolling in too).  All of the staff are college kids which means they will probably have lots of turn-over.  I wish you could sub out their fries with a sandwich for greens, but there is an extra charge for a side salad and you still get their fries (most places downtown offer greens or fries as an option).   Many of their burgers are like AJ bombers which are how many things can we toss on top of a burger (with one exception, HopCat burgers are 1/2 lbs and AJ's are 1/10 lbs).  I plan to stop back soon after 10PM for a 3 dollar beer and snack ..."}
{"text":"I got a burger and fries - don't remember the specifics, but the food was great. There are so many drinks too!"}
{"text":"Went by on a slow afternoon. First time. Waitress didn't seem pleased to seat us. Service was slow even though we were the only people there. Coffee machine was broke. We waited probably 20 mins at 3pm on a Tuesday to finally order.

The food came. Really wanted to try the \"crack fries\" but mine came all soggy and under cooked so they were not good at all, rather have McDonald's. Pretty big let down, you, I wanted to let the waitress know but I honestly thought I shouldn't of bothered.

The burger was nothing special, surprisingly. The meat did not have much flavor and reminded me of the taste of a AJ bombers burger. I ordered with a 'some pink' and she looked at me like I was crazy...even though the menu tells you to order like that...a little pink or none.

Whatever, probably won't be back for weird burgers and soggy fries"}
{"text":"Hopcat has added exactly what was needed to the State Street area. It's a little more upscale than the younger crowd bars, which is a big plus for me. The beer list is always changing and never disappoints. The food has been delicious - don't skimp on the crack fries! The servers and bartenders have always been attentive and knowledgeable when I've been. Late night menu is offered, as well.

If you get stuck in the outside line, it's never taken me more than ten minutes to get in (prior to 10:00). It gets crowded and seating might not be available right away, but with so much room in the bar areas both upstairs and down, I've never minded much."}
{"text":"A great lunch or dinner option. They have lots of beer options on tap for the experienced connoisseur or for someone looking to sample some new beers. The food is good (i have only had salads here). The sandwiches and burgers looked tasty too! The fries are the BEST in town! Pure crack heaven and super addictive. You have been warned!"}
{"text":"Beat service in all of Madison! These people know what they're doing, especially Josh. We found our new favorite place. We will be back here many times. Cold beer and amazing wings and things! Big salads and amazing food all around."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place if you like beer! 130 taps, of which 30 taps are local Wisconsin brews that are featured with $1.50 off I think for their happy hour. Large variety of beer styles too, as you might guess when there are 130 brews on tap. Ciders, meads, stouts, ales, pilsners, IPA's, Belgians, sours, whew!
They have a full food menu to soak up your drinks, we were not there to eat and only had a snack: the crack fries. They come with a beer cheese dipping sauce that rocks. Super tasty and came in an amount suitable for 2 to nosh on. 
The place is basically a large open room, broken up somewhat by the long bar in the middle. Nice mural on the wall. I would return for the excellent beer selection, not the ambience which was secondary. Would HAVE to have more \"crack\" fries for sure.  Excellent music when I was there, Classic Rock! I wish I lived closer to this place, I think I would be a regular here..."}
{"text":"Great place! Open seating and they were busy but no wait when I went on a busy game day Saturday. Good food, fries are awesome! HUGE and fantastic beer list! They really do have a good thing going!"}
{"text":"This bar is SUPER unique for the 100+ tap beer options that always rotate, and for that alone, it would get 5 stars. 

I've come here multiple times, all at very different hours (lunch/happy hour/dinner/late night) and with a varying group of people. 

The service is beyond random, which is why I deducted a star. Sometimes I have great service, usually during dinner hours and with bigger groups. The other day, however, I had terrible service during a lunch hour and with only 3 people in my group. The server took SO much time to get everything, and spent more time chatting with the bartender. There were only about 10 other people eating, so I have no idea why everything was so slow. Her attitude showed no indication of acknowledging this, and I felt like she already assumed that because I'm a student, I wouldn't tip well. Having been in food service, I WOULD have tipped over 20% but I just couldn't bring myself to it with this server. I used a Hooked App deal to get discounts on the burgers, and still tipped 15% of the full price, begrudgingly. 

The meal is always just okay to me. Honestly if you eat anything, eat the Crack Fries. 

Crack Fries and Beer Flights are what gives this place 3 stars. The loss of the other 2 are for just-okay food and inconsistent service. 

I'm sure I'll be back, but only to spend my money on the things that are a guarantee there - good beer and good fries."}
{"text":"130 beers on tap, quick service and Crack Fries. Try the That'll do Donkey cocktail,  it will make any day better."}
{"text":"Holy crack fries! Passing through here for work and dropped in with the crew to check out the fries. I had high hopes and was not disappointed. When you walk in the room is very open with seating all the way around the bar and lots of tables to spread out if you need some space. We sat at the bar and the service was fantastic. The beer menu was huge and all the local craft beers were $3.50 on Monday!? I ordered the Angry Bird which is their version of a buffalo chicken sandwich and it was special. It wasn't the regular ole sandwich that usually comes out at a place like this, it had quality ingredients... fresh lettuce, crisp onions, and a flavor of buffalo sauce that I will crave from now on. Next to it sat the crack fries. I haven't finished an order of fries in years until yesterday. These crunchy little devils are packed with texture and flavor and not a single one of them wasn't perfect. They were lightly battered and dusted with some combination of salt, pepper, sugar, and magic. Great environment, great service, tons of craft beers, and exceptional food quality. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Lots of beers on tap. I love that there is a section of the menu devoted to local brews. 

Talk about a huge space...it's almost overwhelming. The upstairs if it's open is much cozier and feels more like a Madison kind of place. 

The food feels a bit industrial, but it is served promptly. I know \"team service\" is the big thing right now in food and beverage world, but it's a bit strange to have one person take your order, another bring the drinks, a different one bring your food, someone else check on how everything tastes, and then the \"server\" again when you need your check. It's really hard to judge the level of service you got from your \"server\" when trying to determine what kind of tip to leave. I'd almost prefer things to take a little longer and deal with one person the whole time. 

Some of the menu items have hilarious names: \"Vladimir Poutine\" and \"Better Living Through Tacos\" are two of my favorites that come to mind.

I'll go back again, if not just to check on the latest tap selection.

I know I've left a 3-star rating, but keep in mind that Yelp says 3-stars is \"A-OK\", which this place is."}
{"text":"I LOVE the variety of beers and their beer menu is nicely organized! The crack fries are a MUST HAVE!! The pulled pork is also incredible! The only problem I've had when I've gone there is timely seating. Even when it is slow, it seems to take 5-10 minutes to be seated. But the food and drinks are worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after spending the morning at New Glarus Brewery.  It was packed... as I expect it is quite often.  We got seats at the bar right away and reviewed the rather large tap list. Found a few beers we wanted and then ordered some food.  I got the black bean burger and it was pretty damn tasty. The crack fries are good but without the sauce they are just not the same... get the sauce...get extra sauce...then get more. Yes, it's that good.  I would love to try this place again but also look forward to when they open one in Milwaukee."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a beer (or 100) with friends! HopCat is HUGE, with lots of bar and dining space. I came here with a group when it was pretty busy, but we had no problem getting a table. 

The beer list is very extensive, with lots of variety. I would definitely come back to try more beers! 

We had the crack fries, and I found them pretty underwhelming. Maybe my expectations were high because of the name or what I'd heard from others, but they just seemed like regular fries with cheese sparsely scattered on top. We didn't try any other food, but the menu had a lot of options. I don't know that I'd come here just for food, but if I was having a few beers I'd check out more of the food menu.

I'm looking forward to going back to explore the beer list!"}
{"text":"I come mostly for the amazing selection of tap beers-local, nationwide, and international. The food is not to be forgotten though as they service a nice meal of the American bar variety but not super greasy. And there is space for big groups and smaller and plenty of room around the bar (and tv's for sports viewing). I enjoying coming here as I hop around State St."}
{"text":"Incredible selection of beer, and extremely cool decor on the inside. Staff was super friendly and helped with picking my perfect beer selection. Ordered the spinach dip and pizza logs and they were delicious. Definitely recommend stopping in this place if you're in Madison."}
{"text":"With Cracked Fries that'll make your knees shake, and a BLT Benny that has you asking, \"Where on earth have you been all my life?\" HopCat has not only an immensely large beer list, but an even larger than life atmosphere, full of great food and an awesome wait staff."}
{"text":"Other than the great TVs, it wasn't very good. 

Except for the fried pretzel sticks; they were awesome."}
{"text":"This place is so new and always packed. I honestly saw a line out the door on game day! I just think the food and atmosphere is fine.

I really like the murals on the walls. It's a really open layout. It's way too cold inside!

As for the food, my husband and I started off with a super cheesy spinach dip. It was burnt, but still tasty.

He got the Paddy Melt and I got a veggie burger with a chipotle muenster cheese spread. He said his sandwich was good tasting but incredibly greasy, so he felt sick afterward. My veggie burger was SO dry and boring. I couldn't taste the cheese at all. About a week later, we both struggled to remember what we even ordered. But we did remember the crack fries! Those were very addictive, and definitely named well. I think in the future I'd like to just come in for fries? Haha.

Great beer selection, but not a great selection for people like me who don't like beer. My husband had fun choosing and really liked his dark beer. I wanted a hard cider but a lot were out of stock, and then the ones left were just way too pricey. I ended up getting the house white wine, which was probably the worst wine I've had in years and years. So, there's that. (I was under the impression that there's cocktail choices too, but didn't see the alcohol nor any hard alcohol on the menu)"}
{"text":"In Madison overnight and had the chance to wander down to HopCat in the middle of the beautiful downtown area. We had an incredible experience. If you love beer, then this is the place for you! Wait staff was not only friendly but knowledgeable and experienced. Our waiter brought us several samples, which helped us make up our minds perfectly. This beer menu is curated expertly, with beers from various categories and local craft brews as well. Wow! Also highly recommended for the 21 and older crowd."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night and only had to wait for about 20 minutes. They have a texting service for when your table is ready which was great as we got to go explore state street a bit. We had excellent food (crack fries whaaaat) but what really stood out was the knowledge and friendliness of our server, Allan Clark! He knew the answers to every single question we had and was more than willing to answer them. I was worried that since it was so busy a server would rush through getting drink orders but he took all the time we needed, going through everything. A few members of my group are not very knowledgeable of beer and completely trusted Allan Clark  to bring them beer they would like, after telling him what their taste preferences were. He brought back delicious flights that we all shared and loved. Could not have asked for a better or more knowledgeable server! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Rolled out of work at 11 pm ISO a place to have a couple beers before catching the last bus home. Not my first visit, previous visits were in the 3-4 star range. 

It was Tuesday night, and the website said they feature \"late nite happy hour\", so I got a little excited and walked in...

... to an almost empty, but huge, bar/restaurant just off State Street. Thinking hopefully I might get served quickly, I got instead the following treatment (which inspired me to write this review):

I sat down at the bar, behind which I saw 3 people at the far end. It wasn't long before I understood why. It allowed them to ignore me. I sat there for 4 long minutes before the first of the three people behind the bar came up with a menu. I'll call him Alley Oop, and he's about 80% of the 2 stars. The other 20% goes to the cook who got my food out fast.

Alley had a good personality and did his job well. He was starting to make it a positive experience. He took my order, got me my first beer, wasn't a prick.

The cheese curds were the worst that I've ever had. A thick rubbery coating is not what I love in a deep-fried cheese curd. I love curds that practically melt in my mouth. To make matters worse, KETCHUP is NOT an appropriate dipping sauce. Think if you had some cheddar cheese and some lousy, rubbery bread. Would you want to dip it in KETCHUP?

Alley and I agreed that the KETCHUP doesn't work.

Meanwhile, as I'm chewing on my first of a basket  of lousy curds, I notice that Alley failed to bring me even one napkin. About halfway through the basket, Level Down appears nearby, the first time since I got here. I called out to him twice, \"SIR\", and the 2nd time he heard me. \"Could I please have a napkin?\" That's when Level Down, who clearly would rather be playing WoW or Black Ops or Game of Thrones or Diddy Kong Racing shocked me off my barstool. For real. He turned around and, seemingly in a flash, put a stack of 3-4 napkins on the bar right in front of me. And that was the last thing he did right.

Then he notices that I am down to the last 1/3 of my beer. So he asks me if I'd like another, mentioning that it is last call. It has been 18 minutes since I sat down and was deliberately ignored for the first 4 minutes. In Madison, Wisconsin, where all of this took place, it was 163 minutes/2 hours and 23 minutes to bar time (2:00 a.m.). But I confirm with Level Down that this bar is closing in 23 minutes, at 12:00 a.m., with people at the bar and a few groups seated at tables. I ask Level Down if he could pour me another beer. No. So much for \"late nite\". Level Down has Legend of Zelda s*** to do. He \"informs\" me that there are other bars still open. Idiot. I was born a short 12 minute bike ride from this spot more than half a century ago. Take your advice and stuff it in your PS3.

I'm eating the sandwich when The Girl With The Tattoos walks by and takes the empty glass. My thought at the moment was, \"She didn't even say a word to me, didn't look at me, treated me like I wasn't even there.\" 

Finally, my Reuben sandwich with the fries and beer cheese sauce came. The sauce was the best thing on the plate. The fries were    okay      but just okay. Thank heavens for the beer cheese sauce that earned the other star. The Reuben sandwich was

Just

A

Reuben.

Nothin' noteworthy. I am a Reuben connoisseur. It was not a bad Reuben. Nor was it a good Reuben. It was

Just

A

Reuben.

I was finished with the second beer before I finished the sandwich. Barely touched the fries. Alley suggested that \"maybe the cheese curds put me over.\"


I checked the time before my last bite; just missed the bus.

I've never had a restaurant/bar staff treat me so badly. 

To Hopcat Madison Management:

Alley Oop rocks, but he could step it up a bit; Level Down is worthless.  The Girl With The Tattoos has tattoos in place of a personality. Didn't even make any efforts to socialize with me. Level Down just doesn't get it.

Just saying."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful place to get your beer drinking on!  The food is good but really the main reason to come is for the experience.  There are new and interesting brews on the expansive and rotating menu.  

I know I will be back in the new future."}
{"text":"My wife and I have gone here a couple times on date night. We've only ever gotten appetizers and drinks but it's always been a great experience. The beer menu is awesome, it gives you an opportunity to try new and different and the tried and trues. The food offerings are standard bar food, but done REALLY well. Lastly the service is top notch, manager, bartenders, wait staff all very knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Crack fries: aptly named. Beer selection: ridiculous. Burgers: gigantic and tasty. Staff: exceptionally attentive (especially since it was the first day). 

To be honest I went in expecting to be let down because it seems like the kind of thing I would hate, but they seem to have figured out a really solid recipe for making this behemoth establishment something interesting and worthy of return visits. 

I was especially impressed with the service as our waiter was super friendly, knowledgable, and on top of everything. I'm also excited for their killer happy hour specials (half off burgers and $3 taps!) and their giant Bloody Mary bar on Sundays. 

The real test will be seeing what the atmosphere is like when the students return as that will really make or break a place like this for me and my friends."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and a Surley promotion going on while we were there. Bar service was extremely slow, though, which really detracted from our experience."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a brunch place without a wait in Madison, come here. Great service, great food. The Crack fries were as good as they claimed."}
{"text":"HopCat you are up there in my books. We came during their Happy Hour prior to seeing a show at The Overture. Half priced burgers = awesome and $3 for local tap beers = amazing. 

The restaurant itself has a lot of seating, especially at the bar which is huge. There's something for everyone with so many beers on tap to choose from. Service was great. 

A great casual place to meet friends or come after work for Happy Hour. Also, the crack fries are delicious. Try them and I promise you won't be disappointed!

There are similar other establishments like HopCat popping up around the area. But, after trying other similar places, I have to say that I prefer HopCat over the rest. 

And the location can't be beat. As it is right off of State Street, it is close to anything downtown and easily accessible if your in the area. 

I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This. Place. Was. My. Jam. 
Five star for food. Everything I have ever ordered here has been delicious (with the exception of the poutine - would not recommend). Their burgers are solid. The crack fries probably contain crack because I CAN'T QUIT THEM!

Also they have 130 taps that have solid staples and excellent rotations. AND not just beer! They have so many different varieties to choose from that anyone could find something they like there. 

When I lived in Madison I would eat here once a week while partaking in trivia so I can say that you will probably not leave disappointed if you order within your comfort zone. 

Service is hit or miss depending on how busy they are. Usually always pleasant service but definitely not always 5-Star quality. 

That being said go in knowing that if it's really busy they may forget your order once or twice but their food is so good I would immediately return if I still lived in Madison."}
{"text":"Listen, I know HopCat is a chain, and I know that's not hip, but for $29 we got 4 delicious beers that were recommended by our servers and placed an order to the kitchen just before it closed and were accepted graciously. The staff here are SUPER nice and helpful and clearly care about the product and there isn't a place in Madison where you'll see better prices.

We also got the Vladimir Poutine, which was delicious - a classic poutine with a grainy gravy with hints of mustard. I REALLY enjoyed it and so did my date! I'm looking forward to trying the Minneapolis location, especially due to the breadth of selection of beers!"}
{"text":"The fries here are amazing, but the rest of the food is sub-par. The waitress' are all college students and liked to talk to each other more than service the tables. This visit was ok, but have had no urge to return."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, lots of beers on tap, friendly staff, awesome happy hour deals.  I've been here for lunch a few times and at night. Gets pretty busy later at night but no matter what time of day, I've had great service. The crack fries... Well the name speaks for itself. Burgers are always juicy and perfectly cooked. This is my favorite place to grab a burger and beer in Madison."}
{"text":"Nice busy interior
Nearly overwhelming beer selection 
Friendly bartenders
Overpriced apps and beer
Music too loud especially given acoustics of space
Mostly young twenty something crowd
Out of basic liquors"}
{"text":"Good food and good beer!
They have so many choices and it takes quite a while to decide on what you want. But the staff are very kind to give recommendations."}
{"text":"Came here off the street with a party of six to watch the Badger football game. TVs located everywhere showing the game.

Great beer selection and a knowledgeable waitress about the many types. Two of us are experienced home brewers, so we were impressed she could speak about beer. We were all pleased with the types we got. It is cool being able to navigate a menu like that and try fresh tap beer.

Everyone except me got the grilled cheese with tomato soup. I heard them talk about the incredible three cheeses, thin sliced apple and honey. 

I got Kobayashi's Revenge, which is a hot dog topped with chili cheese, over their Crack Fries. Really good. I did not get a second hotdog for $4. The meal and three beers during the span of a football game were enough.

Atmosphere, service, beer selection, beer quality, food selection and quality, price, all 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place has a great beer selection, food is very good, and the service was exceptional. If we are ever back in Madison, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hopcat is always a go to when I'm on state street. Went on Friday evening and had Allen as our server. It was some of the best service I've experienced! Very attentive, nice, and his menu knowledge was impeccable. The crack fries are the best fries ever, loaded are even better. & they have a great beer selection."}
{"text":"I've walked past Hop Cat countless number of times.  I've always said I wanted to go but never did.  I finally made it here for lunch before we left town and I regret not going any sooner.I was craving a nice juicy burger and a beer.  I assumed Hop Cat had a large tap list because of the name.  They have beer from all over the country. 

For food, I had the Cowboy burger with no jalapenos because I'm a loser when it comes to spice.  The Cowboy burger comes with pepper jack, apple cider BBQ sauce and BACON.  The burger was lightly covered in the apple cider BBQ sauce and it was amazing.  It had a hint of apple.  Usually BBQ overpowers the food but this was light and nice.  I ate my whole entire burger in one sitting.  The burgers come with the famous \"crack fries\".  Crack fries are seasoned with what seems like a meat rub.  They are very delicious. 

We ended up visiting over Happy Hour, and it was a great deal.  We got half price burgers.  What a steal!  We will be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday and sat at the bar and was very disappointed. Beer selection was great and the loaded crack fries were amazing, but that's where the greatness stopped. Bartenders were absolutely terrible. They never checked up on my friend and I (ever heard of 2 bites, 2 minutes?) after dropping our food off and waited what felt like forever for another beer. Usually I'm forgiving if the bar is full and they look weeded but the bar was far from. The icing on the cake was when I found a napkin WITH DRIED BLOOD ON IT and pointed it out to the bartender who did absolutely nothing but say \"that's not blood\" and take the napkin. I work at a hospital, I know what dried blood looks like. He made no apology, no effort whatsoever. From someone who's worked in the service industry I was in shock at the bartenders awful attitude and service. 1 star for the fries, but that's all this place has going for it."}
{"text":"Perfect place for meet ups and hang outs for two main reasons: Over one hundred taps and a kitchen that's open late night! I do however wish that they served some liquor and that they didn't charge for tasting beer, but I can see how that can be difficult to manage as well. FIRST AND FOREMOST, it would be an understatement to say that I am addicted to their, properly-named, Crack Fries. It would be sin to eat it without ordering their cheese sauce. Just DON'T do it. It's still really good, but c'mon now. If you are feeling like stepping up your game, you can also buy the Loaded Crack Fries which comes with jalapenos, more cheese, and bacon. In my opinion though,  this is a nice treat once in a while, but I am definitely more of a fan of the normal Crack Fries with their cheese sauce! I am glad I can eat it all nit long while drinking different types of brews! In addition, it is definitely an addition that the servers are knowledgeable of the different types of beer that they serve. They are also more than capable of providing samples base on what you like and previous beers you've liked. If you are looking for a medium-sized dish, border-lining an appetizer, I suggest giving their adult mac n' cheese a try too! Again. A good compliment to your brews. As far as their burgers or sandwiches go, there's not a huge option, but the ones that they do do, they do well. My personal favorites are the BarZee and the Cowboy! Pro-Tip: Get more Crack Fries and cheese sauce!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while now.  On a Tuesday around lunch my husband and I decided to go ahead and give it a try.

Even through it didn't appear to be busy (maybe 5 other tables/booths had people at them and a couple people seated at the bar) we waited a minute or two to be seated, even after the girl at the bar looked over at us a few times and didn't say a thing.  There was a \"wait to be seated sign\" so it wasn't like we were supposed to find our own seat.  

I love the atmosphere.  I loved sitting in the booths that they had.

Our waitress was sweet, refilled our water without asking and came back several times to see how things were and if we needed anything else.  

They did have a large selection of beers.  The food menu seemed a little overpriced for what you were getting.  I feel I could have walked up the block and got something similar for half the price. 

It did take a while for our food to come based on how few people were there.  

When our food came it was okay.  And I'm not that picky about food!  For the price, I don't think I would go back.  I didn't like the crack fries everyone seems to be raving about.  I thought they were overly seasoned.  My husband, however, did enjoy them.  I also asked for my burger to be medium well done.  It was PINK.  The waitress apologized and offered to bring a different one (which was nice) but I really didn't want to wait for another one so I just ate the one I was given.  I also overheard a man sitting in the booth next to us that his burger was undercooked from what he ordered as well (bloody, even.). 

I guess for the food we got I don't think it was worth the price (or the time) we spent there.  The beer selection is nice, but this is Wisconsin, it's not like finding a good beer selection at a restaurant is hard to come by.  

Average, but not better than that."}
{"text":"Probably our fault because we came on a game day but service was crazy slow. We also were dying for cheese curds and they weren't very good - I got a bunch without any cheese inside! French onion soup is TINY for $5 and crazy salty. I will say the southwest salad with the veggie burger was good though"}
{"text":"I love everything about HopCat. If you're looking for a fantastic beer selection and yummy pub food, plus a friendly staff with knowledge of the beer- this is your place!"}
{"text":"This place has a huge variety of tap beers, as well as a large area for dining. We sat at the bar for a few beers and to watch the Final Four. The man who was our bartender was extremely helpful and very friendly. He made conversation with us and made us feel welcome. The only thing I would change is that the distance between the bar and some of the booths was relatively small. I'd definitely return to try more of the many types of beer."}
{"text":"Not only is this place completely mediocre, it appears they pay people by the word to give them 4 and 5 star reviews. Come on! No one has that many things about a super generic restaurant. I've been here three times. Each time it's fair to Ok and nothing overwhelming either way. Go to Cafe Hollander at Hilldale instead."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I know I'm getting bar food when I come here. More beer options than you could ever want, so that's what makes this place fun. And it's nice that you can try two samples before settling on one full glass!"}
{"text":"I love the huge selection of beers but the food is just OK. Nothing special at all, even when there are menu items called \"crack fries,\" which you'd think would be super addicting, but are just meh. Most beers you can get around town, so I'd go somewhere with better food if I was going to go out for a beer."}
{"text":"The cheese curds were good. I also had the Damn Good Fish Sandwich and Oscar's Chocolate Oatmeal Stout."}
{"text":"LOVE Hopcat.. my friends and I go there very often! Great location, outstanding staff... BUT *beware* their food is insanely addictive and keeps bringing me back!  

Enjoy! 
JCD"}
{"text":"Grab a beer and get the crack fries. That's all you need to know and I guarentee you will love it."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, they have a special on burgers during the week you can't beat. Happy hour drink specials. Food was good, exactly as I ordered it, prompt and the staff was attentive. I didn't have to wait for drinks. It wasn't too loud. There are numerous seating options, from at the bar, by the window, booths, and an open area and a very large horseshoe shaped bar. They have a bunch of TV's near the bar so you can avoid them if you want but you need to sit closer to the bar to see them well. Full Bar. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish and chips.  Generous portion of fried cod in dippable size.  A bit greasy, but very fresh.  Crack fries accompanied.  Was looking forward to trying them, and was not disappointed. Thin potato strips covered with a tasty sprinkle... garlic and herbs? Not sure. But very very yummy. Excellent lunch!"}
{"text":"Two words: Crack Fries. They are everything. You need to get them. And don't sleep on their cheesy dipping sauce.

My friends and I love HopCat. It's become somewhat of a go-to spot when friends from out of town come to Madison or we just have a large group of people. I love the food, the drinks, and the ambiance, and I've never had a bad experience here.

One of my favorite menu items is their Madtown Grilled Cheese which comes with a cup of Apple-Tomato soup and of course a side of Crack Fries! The grilled cheese comes with several types of cheese, apple slices and a sauce that combines garlic aioli and honey! You can also add bacon if you want. The soup is sweet, spicy, and surprising. The tomato apple combo totally works for me. 

In addition to the fantastic food, they have 100-some beers on tap and some fun cocktails (I recommend the \"Skip the Mimosa\" off their cocktail menu). If you are overwhelmed by the beer list, you get two free samples every visit so don't be afraid to try something new!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place! Five stars for the ambiance, food and service. The atmosphere was hip and casual. Bright colors painted on the walls, retro red pleather booths, and an amazing bar with OVER 30 local beers on draft! 

Our waitress was younger and super friendly. She helped me decide on a good local beer and made sure we knew about the must haves for food. I started off with a Hopalicious by Ale Asylum which is brewed right in Madison. Just enough hop but still easy to drink! Then for my entree I ordered the burger with pepper jack cheese and of course, the crack fries with cheese. My goodness they were life changing! The seasoning on the fries and then dip them in the cheese...YUM! My burger was thick and cooked perfectly. It was all around just great! 

Perfect place for dinner or to just grab a late night drink with friends! Decent prices and top notch quality. I will definitely come back. You must try Hop Cat!"}
{"text":"Go for happy hour!

Happy hour is M-Th 2-6pm and the deals are great! $3 local WI brews (there's like 30 to chose from) and 1/2 off burgers! Now that's a cheap meal! 

The burgers are super thick and come with a generous side of their \"crack fries\". Now these are said to be in the top 10 best fries in America, and while they are pretty tasty, I'm not sure I can say top 10. I asked for my burger to be medium and it was more like medium-well, but it was still a pretty decent burger. 

Between my burger and pint of beer, I only spent $8! Can't do much better than that!"}
{"text":"BEER, BEER, BEER!  A great selection with a great atmosphere to go along with it.  Very noisy and croweded though.  Probably shouldn't take anyone here on a first date.  It'll be impossible to hear them, let alone be able to find a table to talk to them.  Although very large areas, given the location, they are typically full often.

Given the atmosphere, it's a great place for hanging with all of your homies."}
{"text":"This place just opened in July 2015, and the word is out, because it's busy! They have 130 beers on tap! You're sure to find something you'll like. They also have a full bar, if you're in the mood for a cocktail. As for food, they've got great appetizers and yummy burgers. Their Crack Fries have been rated Top Ten French Fries in America by The Food Network. So I tried the Loaded Crack Fries: crack fries topped with cherry smoked bacon, red onion, jalapenos and five pepper beef chili, smothered in warm cheese sauce. They call them Crack Fries because they're addictive, and they did not disappoint. My only complaint would be that the bar service could've been better. We grabbed seats at the bar, and they were pretty busy, but it took quite a while for one of five bartenders to finally greet us and offer us a beverage."}
{"text":"Great food and great beer. The buffalo egg roles are actually spicy which is great! Thanks Emily, you were great and we will be back again."}
{"text":"Never have I ever finished the french fries before the burger, at this place however, the \"crack fries\" are as addictive as their namesake. The burger itself was perfectly medium rare and delicious and the recommended brew was excellent. It's no surprise these guys are a bit famous. Next time I'm in Madison this is the first place I'll eat."}
{"text":"Excellent place to come after a long day at work. Place was hopping midweek which typically says it must be good.... and it was!! 

Good service and even better food.

Will go back to try other eats."}
{"text":"I'd this place a higher rating if people didn't think it was so wonderful. It is true: they have a lot of beers. It is true: their food is really good. It is true: their wait-staff is knowledgable. However, the atmosphere is falsely urban, the lights were way too dark, and the music was way too loud. I would really like to like this place, but I felt alienated from everything. For what you pay, the portions are awfully small and I couldn't hear my friends. Better bet? Go to Brassiere V or Alchemy!"}
{"text":"I just had a few beers here and bites of their fries, which are apparently their specialty. Everyone else seemed to like their food a lot. Our waitress was friendly and efficient. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I don't know! I've been here many times and can't figure it out.

Their beers are good, but should do better specials for them frankly, because I tend to go to Mr Brews for better deals.

As for food... Never impressed or satisfied."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch. The food was pretty good and they had a good beer list. I would come back for lunch again. The wait was 20 minutes on a Saturday. The waiter was also helpful with my allergies."}
