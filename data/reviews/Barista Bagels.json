{"text":"I went here for a quick lunch and waiting in the longish line I was fairly unenthusiastic. Then figured I was probably going to have a bland lunch when they didn't have Del's lemonade either, like they advertise on their board. It did not bode well! They gave me a number, I sat down and they brought over my deli sandwich pretty quickly and for such a bad start, the tuna salad on the freshest bagel ever made up for it. The chips weren't homemade but they were at least nicer than store brand. Plus, while it seems pricey for a bagel with a scoop of tuna, the portion was very friendly."}
{"text":"Bad coffee. The only plus is convenience, if you stayed at the hotel. I'd rather walk to the mc donalds"}
{"text":"Very unhappy with our bagels which tasted like day old bagels and we're not toasted. Brought them back for a refund"}
{"text":"The coffee is terrible, the bagels are nothing special, and the service is beyond slow. Maybe I'm just too used to pulling up to a Dunkin Donuts back east and watching them blow through a line of 10 people like nothing, but what was supposed to be a quick breakfast run before hitting the strip turned into a lesson about how in Vegas you need to wait in line for -everything-."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels, great variety of bagels and spreads, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait. Better places nearby if your willing to walk. I recommend going elsewhere"}
{"text":"Expensive and terrible food. The cinnamon bun was way too dry and way too sweet. The scrambled eggs were very dense even for powdered eggs, which is what they were. Coffee was worse than Starbucks, which is saying a lot. Okay, on second thought, maybe it wasn't worse than Starbucks, but pretty darn close. Never again."}
{"text":"CHEAP and YUMMY! I LOVE THE COFFEE here. It's WAY BETTER than ANY other coffee place i've EVER been. It used to be called Boyd's Barista. The only other place I know where you can get some Boyd's coffee is at  Antique Row in San Diego. It's so SMOOTH and FLAVORFUL! I wish they made more of these places it would blow STARBUCKS out of the water ANYDAY! But most coffee places already do :)"}
{"text":"I came here at 7am to get breakfast. It's freshly made, but that means a 10 min wait for a egg, cheese and ham toasted breakfast bagel?! I almost finished my coffee by the time the order was ready. This was only 3 customers ahead of me. Imagine what this place would be like at lunchtime?

The service is pretty stern for this hour of the morning, except one lady who made an effort to greet people with a smile and send them on their way. But the lady who handles the order and delivery to customers is fierce!"}
{"text":"We needed a quick breakfast before checking out of Circus Circus so I ran down to Barista Bagels. OK, the line was fairly long and it didn't help much that the guy in front of me had a list as he was ordering for about a half-dozen other people. I can't blame the establishment for that.

So -- Barista has a pretty good selection, from muffins to Danish to fruit cups, but their main claim to fame is, as the name implies, bagels. You can get a BLT or a club, tuna salad, beef and cheddar, etc. The breakfast bagel has egg and cheese and a choice of bacon, ham or sausage. I opted for the sausage patty. Drinks? Well, regular soft drinks, coffee, cappuccino, latte' or cafe' au lait. 

And I snagged a nice big pecan roll to go with the sandwich. Pretty good stuff if you don't have time (or the room!) for a big breakfast and you want something better than an Egg McMuffin."}
{"text":"I stayed at Circus Circus and saw there was a coupon for a free coffee. They serve breakfast and bagels. So I decided to give this place a try.

The location was tucked in the back of the upstairs promenade near the carnival area. 
It was in a very bad location. It's tucked in the back and I had a hard time finding this place.

I got in a huge line to find only one cashier attending several people in line, There were about 30 people in line. It was a very long wait.

I stood in line which felt like forever and then a second cashier opened up. Well I though to myself well cool, were rocking now. Wrong!

I got in the second line of the cashier and was told my an older lady to \"I'll be with you in a minuet\". She was rude and looked me up and down. I'm was like  hummm.

She came back to here register 5 minuets later and told me \"Go ahead with your order\". She was very rude and if she does not like her job then she should find something new. 

I walked over the to the coffee and thought to myself, the worst was over. Wrong!

They ran out of coffee and they ran out of creamer. It was filled another 20 minuets later. 

I had my breakfast and then tried to leave but I couldn't.  There is only one small entrance in the front, so you can imagine carrying a large duffel back through a crowd of 20 people . 

It was difficult to get out of the place! 

Are they worried about someone running off with coffee? They need to open that place up and loose the cage feeling. 

They have a good concept and the bagel sandwich was not that bad. 

I won't be back here, for the wait I could have had better sit down meal somewhere else."}
