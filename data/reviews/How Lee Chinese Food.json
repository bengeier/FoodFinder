{"text":"The restaurant just resides along Forbes avenue, very convenient location. This is the best Chinese restaurant around that area. The taste is closer to sichuan Chinese food which is spicy. However, there are quite a lot of different choices. The food taste is 80 to 90% close to real Chinese food in China. Very tasty. The portion is big, not huge, just nice. Lunch set is quite cheap and suitable for people who may just grab something to eat during lunch period. And the place is less busier during lunch too. Normally it is very busy during dinner time.  It is better to dine in with group of people , then you can order different dishes and share. The service is ok. Maybe due to culture difference,you would not expect big Hi and big smile from the waitress like what you have in American restaurant. 

All food is very good, so far no disappointed dish yet."}
{"text":"How Lee is delicious... Turn to the back of the menu and order the Sichuan food.  You will not be disappointed.  If you have any questions ask the staff... They are extremely helpful and accomadating.  I love the braised beef with celery, cabbage, and leeks. The fish filet hot pot is amazing.  We have ordered the cucumbers with green onion and oil... Nice and refreshing especially when you order spicy food like we always do.  Definitely authentic and Pittsburgh is lucky we have them!"}
{"text":"Not sure where the negative reviews are coming from... everytime I've been here, I've had great service. I go in the evening, and it's usually the woman waiting on me, and she's polite and helpful if you have any questions.

The food is awesome, best kung po chicken for the money in this area. Everything else I've tried has been good also. Ridiculously quick preparation, almost like fast food."}
{"text":"This restaurant totally sucks. We were waiting for more than 30min and when our turn came, this restaurant gave other party seats. It didn't make sense at all. Don't go or you have to wait for 1 hour"}
{"text":"What can I say you get what you pay for. While you might pay more for this Chinese food the quality is fantastic. You can tell that this food is prepared fresh and from scratch, not your average from the freezer stuff. I will be retuning very soon!"}
{"text":"Average tasting Chinese. Not horrible nor fantastic. Good customer service with smiling faces at the counter though."}
{"text":"WOOHOOOO

After a miserable flu week of tasteless food, a friend recommended How Lee, saying that the sichuan food will clear my congestion. As someone that loves any and all spicy foods, I was up for the challenge. As the many of the past reviewers wrote, YOU MUST ORDER FROM THE SICHUAN MENU! You will be greatly rewarded for doing so!

The chili pots put me in a flurry and by the end of a meal, clothes were shed and I was left panting...sure enough my congestion was gone. Delicious delicious delicious.

p.s. This isn't the How Lee from a few years back. New management really means muuuch much better food!"}
{"text":"Never used to come here before the renovations but had heard that this place had good things going for it now.  Came here with my boyfriend and we are hooked; nearly everything we've had from here has been excellent.

There's the standard American Chinese menu that has all of your standard offerings (have had the General Tso tofu at the restaurant which was surprisingly fantastic) but turn to the back of the menu where you'll find the authentic Sichuan menu that has enough spicy food on it to burn a hole in your tongue.

My boyfriend loves authentic Asian cuisine so he always gets something from the authentic menu (e.g. the spicy prawns, chongqing chicken) while I get something far less adventurous (chow fun, hor fun, etc.) to give my poor tongue a break from the spice after I steal a few bites of his meals.  

Love this place for both eat-in and take-out and highly recommend this place as one of the best Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Really satisfied my craving for authentic Sichuan food. Never knew I would find it in Pittsburgh. The dan dan noodles were amazing as was the fish in chili oil and pork with bamboo shoots. Will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"For take-out they are pretty good and nicely priced.  I've heard nothing but great things about their szechuan, and I agree from what I've tried so far.  We're new to the area, but we've already ordered from them a handful of times.  We've also eaten in, and we've had nothing but great service."}
{"text":"Real authentic Sichuan Cuisine.  The real deal.
Off the Sichuan side of the menu:
Stir Fried Pork Belly with Leeks... delicious.
Chendu fried dry hot chicken... spicy with flavor not just heat.
Sauteed Water Spinach...nice green crunchy compliment to the spicy dishes you should be ordering.
Off the non Sichuan side of the menu:
Tofu home style was a generous amount of lightly fried tofu, broccoli (not chinese broccoli, though) in a flavorful dark bean sauce.
This is as good as any Sichuan restaurant I've eaten in where real sichuan food is served in places like  Monterey Park in the San Gabriel Valley of Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area or New York."}
{"text":"Went there for the schezuan. The food was way too salty. The spice was ok , i didn't think it was flavorful."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from them after seeing they had a higher Yelp star rating than two other Chinese places nearby. I've never eaten at the restaurant but after getting their food delivered, I do not plan to ever eat there.

First off: they screwed up our order. My friend ordered the garlic eggplant and instead we got an order of just straight broccoli.  When we called to let them know that we received the wrong food, they didn't offer to replace the food and deliver the correct dish. They also didn't even apologize for the error. To me this is really just poor service.

From the food we received: average at best. Everything we got that was supposed to be hot and spicy was mild. Nothing was particularly great.

I don't think I'll order from here again which is a shame. We were so excited about trying Chinese food for the first time in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Hard to find good chinese restaurants but this place is pretty good.  Had the dan dan noodles which were very good.  The Sichuan menu looks very appetizing.  From the \"American\" menu I had the chicken and broccoli which was also very good.  Will probably order from here again as it is the best chinese I have had in Shadyside/Sq Hill area and I have eaten at about half a dozen of them"}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about this place. My Sichuan friends and I go here all the time searching for spicy and authentic food for our stomach. The portions are large enough to share with friends. The spicy level is just right. They also make less spicy food for light eaters.The ambiance is nice, clean and simple. Service is also great. Ask for Annie, she'll do you right."}
{"text":"My husband and I came across How Lee restaurant by accident and I wasn't sure what to expect of it at first. I am pretty skeptical about any Asian restaurant in Pittsburgh since I haven't found any 'real' ones like those in New York, Boston and Maryland. 

However, when seeing big bowls with 'nothing' but chilies, we thought, \"Hey this must be good!\" We got even more excited when we saw the menu--a ton of Sichuan food to choose from. 

Despite the long wait time, we got our table as soon as patrons left and ordered the Chongqing chicken, which turned out to be very popular, and a slightly milder fish dish. It didn't take too long for the food to come despite the busy time. And the food were delicious! We have been to several Sichuan restaurants, and we have to say that How Lee is one of those that we would go back to again and again. :) 

So if you're looking for GREAT Chinese food, check out How Lee! My husband and I look forward to trying other stuff on their menu (oh yeah, they also have non-Sichuan food which seem to be the 'non-spicy' ones.)"}
{"text":"This was the first time I've been in How Lee since they remodeled. Wasn't aware of a lot of th new dishes they offered unfortunately, the newer Sichuan dishes sound great, definitely need to go back for some of those. Had the Kung pao chicken combo and chongqing dumplings. The chicken fried rice was very bland but it was also much less greasy than most places so it's probably a little healthier. A little soy sauce and siracha fixed it right up. It's also good with a little of the chongking dumpling sauce. The Kung pao was average, definitely could have used some more sauce. The chongqing dumplings were absolutely the shining stars. I could very easily make a meal of them. Slightly nutty, a little sweet and just the right amount of heat. Absolutely loved them which is why I am excited to go back and try some of the other new Sichuan additions."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place so I tried it. Will not come again. It is not real Chinese food even if you order from Sichuan menu."}
{"text":"The double cooked \"pork belly with capsaicin (pepper) spice\" is TO DIE FOR. If you like bacon and a little heat, you'll love this. The Sichuan lunch specials--all under $8 served with fried/white/brown rice and choice of soup...Also, the place is clean and its location in Squirrel Hill makes it a destination rather than just some place to grab a bite. Plenty of shops and nice things to see along Murray and Forbes."}
{"text":"When they first opened, the food was good, but then it went downhill.
Their food is not fresh and every dish is socking with bad oil. 
Not authentic at all since I am from Szechuan, I know how my hometown food taste like. I can cook much better Szechuan dish at home  . Disappointed...."}
{"text":"Pricey, food dining in is passable, take away is quite disappointing, especially the wanton soup which is just a lump of chalk thrown into soup that's tasteless. Service is average, though the counter supervisor seems to be grumpy most days"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and the food has consistently been good.  The food was much better when I dined in than when I did take out, but that might just be the difference between eating it straight out of the kitchen and eating it after it has sat in a container for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Shui Zhu Yu - spicy fish / 5 star dish
Rest were great too.

Come here to get your spice on."}
{"text":"Very very very good place to taste the real Sichuan food just like you are in Chengdu. Forget about the garbage Restaurants which only have American Chinese food. This one all what you need to satisfy ur mouth. The most favorite entree are La zi ji, Mao xue Wang, fei teng yu. Etc."}
{"text":"Try it if u want good Sichuan food. It's above average for food. Four star for the environment. Service is fine."}
{"text":"I've come to eat here more than anywhere else in Pittsburgh over the four years while attending CMU. When I first discovered this place during freshman year, I went crazy and came here way more often than I probably should have. Now, three years later, I still frequent this place when I'm craving spicy food. 

To newcomers, the very last page on the menu is what you should be looking at. Authentic Sichuan cuisine, spicy, oily, fresh, what more is there to want?

It can get pretty crowded, so I try to go around 4-5 pm for a quick, no wait dinner. 

They've also renovated a bit of the inside, and from what I remember, it's still a work in progress."}
{"text":"How Lee is where the best Chinese food (if you like spicy, oily food) can be found in the city. I come often and consistently order the soft tofu with fish fillets, double cooked pork belly, and dry sauteed green beens dishes. Last night I had the sweet eggplant, which I would describe as a crowd pleaser. Our chicken chili pot was average.

The wait staff is attentive and food always comes out quickly."}
{"text":"Great authentic menu & their American Chinese menu is pretty sweet too.  The authentic dumplings in the sweet chili sauce are really good."}
{"text":"First time last time. We ordered some starters and main dishes. Restaurant looked nice, starters came out all good then down hill from there. There are 4 of us, bowls of rice arrive, 10 mins later one entree comes,  10 mins later one more entree comes, 10 mins later another which we had enough and sent back.
30 mins since the rice arrived not everyone has there food and rich is cold. We get I'm sorry
Fix your service, and your customer service was horrible, no manager or owner came near us"}
{"text":"The Sichuan menu is excellent with many items one doesn't usually find at a \"typical\" American Chinese restaurant.  If your spice tolerance is low, beware of the pepper signs, however -- they aren't afraid to use the ma la pepper and its numbing/spicing effects are mighty!  However, the cooling cucumber appetizer is very useful and the many dishes (fish hot pot, fried chicken, stir fried pork, tri pepper chicken) make us happy return customers!  Granted, your plate will likely be a soupy mess of bright orange oil and sizzling peppercorns but you will be happy!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by an Asian doctor I work with. Great recommendation! They have 2 menus, The 'American Chinese menu' and the 'Authentic Chinese menu.' Go authentic, great stuff!"}
{"text":"I used to work at the Starbucks across the street from this place, but after a few bites of a friend's General Tso's chicken and the single greasiest mouthful of egg roll I've ever tasted, I refused to order anything but dumplings from this place.  I've seen them pour the dumplings from a bag straight out of the freezer, so I figured the grimy kitchen couldn't infect them too much.  My fried dumplings usually came charred, but I soaked them in sauce and they got me through a lot of closing shifts at the Bucks.  Still, this is the worst Chinese restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I really love this place. It is priced well and for a lunch special you get a choice or rice and soup and then the entree. Which is good because you can have leftovers. It is also really tasty and delicious. It also has a Szechuan menu as well which is more authentic than american chinese. I have only tried the dan dan noodles from there but it is really good and yummy. I also love the atmosphere there. The food comes out fast and the servers let you be to talk and relax."}
{"text":"Usually the food is good. But this time I ordered delivery. The food came on time, but the sesame chicken was way too dry and I didn't eat much of it."}
{"text":"Going to college here in Pittsburgh, this is one of the go-to spots to get some homey Chinese food. Definitely recommend just getting some classic stir-fried veggies and and meat dish. Can't go wrong with simple and fresh ingredients cooked with no frills, just deliciousness. White rice. watercrest, and some chili beef and I was instantly home again."}
{"text":"As suggested, I ordered of the Szechuan menu.  My son, not a real fan of spicy food ordered off the front part of the menu.  My dish (pork with garlic) was quite good - spicy but not burning, very flavorful.  We also had fish soup with pickles which was an accident, but excellent.  My son' chicken and broccoli was ok.  So, the four stars are for the menu on the back.

A good destination - though everyday noodles would be my first choice in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've known about How Lee for about as long as they've been around, having lived nearly all my life in or near Squirrel Hill. 

(A little history about the place most people don't know or remember: Back in 1993 someone opened a local Chinese take out chain called, not kidding, Ho Lee Chow. Get it? Holy Cow - Ho Lee Chow? It was greeted with as much enthusiasm as you'd expect from a joke name. While the rest of the chain closed, someone bought the one location in Squirrel Hill, eliminated the word \"Chow,\" but took the \"w\"  and stuck it at the end of \"Ho.\" That's where their name came from. They've been there ever since.)

So tonight was my first experience with them. I contacted them for delivery through Grub Hub (look it up - good service!).

The menu itself was a little light on explanation - just names of the dishes with nothing to say what was included in them. But the amount of selections was pretty impressive. Even as a vegetarian, I had a lot to choose from. I decided to go with Tofu Home Style - a tried and true favorite from other places since I wasn't in the mood for experimenting.

The service gave an estimated hour for delivery. Less than thirty minutes later, they were ringing my bell! Thumbs up for *super* fast delivery!

The temperature of the food was right out of the wok *hot*! I've never had delivery that I had to blow on and wait a few minutes before I could eat it. (It probably helped that I'm only about a mile away, but I give them the points anyway.)

The spring rolls were crunchy and delicious - not too greasy and really packed full. Highly recommended!

I asked for, and got, some broccoli in the dish - Tofu Home Style almost never comes with it - and they were generous too. The tofu was nice and firm - I know it's not good for me, but I *really* like my tofu deep fried, and it was *very* tasty. The vegetables were all nice and firm, in fact. Nothing soggy or over cooked at all.

If I had to make one criticism, it would be the ratio of tofu to vegetables. I like a few more veggies and a little less of the tofu chunks. But for a first order, I was pretty happy.  

Next time I'll experiment with an unknown, but for something I like and can be picky about, they did well and now have a new customer."}
{"text":"By no means am I a picky eater, nor do I expect much from cheap Asian carry  out but this meal was sub par at best. Just a quick break down of what we ordered: I had the Sesame Beef and Shrimp Eggs rolls and my girlfriend had the crab Rangoon and Crispy shrimp with broccoli.    
Sesame Beef = really chewy beef with too much thick sauce
Shrimp Egg Roll = average/what expected
Crab Rangoon = bad/really chew
Crispy Shrimp = I got an 'Ok' from the girl

Due the amount of different places like this in the area, I would try another and not order from here again. I guess I should have see this coming when I noticed that they also sell lotto tickets in addition to Asian food."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere. Attentive staff. Will second some of the comments here about ordering off the Sichuan style menu. 

Kung pao chicken was excellent, and not too spicy but still hot. Water boiled fish was decent, though not something I normally order."}
{"text":"One of these days, I'll actually walk into How Lee and have dinner at a table.  Until then, my monthly (or semi-monthly, sometimes) Americanized Chinese food fix will arrive, promptly and courteously, at my front door, care of one of How Lee's friendly delivery drivers.

My usual order is orange chicken (white meat only), pork fried rice, and a handful of egg rolls, which is enough food to last through at least a few delicious meals.  I've ordered maybe a dozen other dishes from How Lee over the past few years, and they've always been excellent, too.  The veggies are consistently fresh, and the meat is never too fatty.  The egg rolls are in a league of their own.

The prices are totally reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food, and the delivery range is enormous.  If you live in Pittsburgh and haven't tried How Lee, you're doing yourself a grave injustice."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food ever. I totally got sick after eating their take-out."}
{"text":"If you love real spicy Chinese food, this is the place. See the reviewer Jenny C's reivew, she hits the nail on the head. And like her, I only go for the Sichuan food, not the American-Chinese food. If you're not familiar, it's all about chili peppers and tongue-numbing peppercorns. 

The Sichuan menu is pretty robust, and while I can't help but order dry fried chicken, I really love the mala, the cumin beef and the fish. There are a few things I've yet to try, but it will happen. I really respect the fact that they don't offer a 1-10 scale or any such thing. If there are 3 chili peppers, then the dish is really, really, really spicy. Either order it, or not.

I also tip my hat (and tip, monitarily) the waitresses. They hustle, not only serving but bussing in a very busy restaurant. They don't miss a beat, they don't get your order wrong, they don't forget to refill your water, they bring your check when you're done without having to ask.

Be wary of going on weekends at lunch and dinner--it gets really busy and you may have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend who knew the owners. When our waitress came they had a conversation in chinese. The waitress then brought back a water and a tea. I grabbed the water when my friend informed me they were both for her. The waitress came back to take our orders. I ordered to egg drop soup inititally. It was way too thick and upset my stomach. It was like slurping egg yolk. My friend got some pork and celery dish. It looked amazing. I then ordered the dumplings. My \"waitress\" asked me if I wanted pork or veggie. I told her veggie. A long wait later she brought out pork dumplings. She asked me \"you wanted pork right?\" I replied no. She went back to the kitchen. 5 minutes later she comes out and tells me they didn't have any veggie dumplings. At this point I was so hungry, thirsty, and frustrated I gave up. This was terrible experience and I plan to share it with anyone who suggests I go back to this place. One star for my friends amazing looking dish. I'll stick to new dumpling house."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the neighborhood and popped by for dinner. Very simple style, but the food was great and authentic chinese. The service was quick and friendly. I recommend this restaurant and would come again if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here, we've gone many times.  Ordered this last time from the authentic Sizchuan menu, unbelievably hot and spicy--and I love spicy!  Almost couldn't eat it, but I love that!  (great left overs)"}
{"text":"Visited the first time for take out. The food was amazing, the best Chinese food we've ever had! Staff was nice and helpful. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"i tried the cold noodle its really good and good size for me. fast prepared, especially for togo"}
{"text":"Out of 5:

3.5 - Twice Cooked Pork Belly: soft and flavorful pork slices, though a bit salty and oily.
2.0 - Garlic Chicken

3.0 - Service: attentive, polite, and fast"}
{"text":"I have traveled to many large foodie cities and this is one of the best Chinese restaurants that I have visited! And, that is just the food! The hostess was welcoming / the waitstaff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu / and everyone has a smile on their face -- which makes the restaurant very welcoming and the meal even more enjoyable -- but, the food is the star (everything is perfectly cooked and as spicy as U want it) -- highly recommended (this was my 3rd visit and I will be back soon) -- very vegetarian friendly and the option of nicely cooked brown rice!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese delivery I've found in Pittsburgh. Unlike other places - in which the chicken preparations are actually all batter and no respectable pieces of chicken to speak of- the orange chicken, general tsos etc all have very succulent, sizable chicken.  Only complaint is that the general tsos is somewhat lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"Like it. Every time when I want some spicy Szechuan style food, I go this place. Always order from the Szechuan menu since the food will be totally different from the regular menu. And good and quick service too."}
{"text":"\"The New\" How Lee is a great example of just how much the food scene in Pittsburgh has developed and grown over the past decade. Not so long ago, How Lee's was a down-and-dirty corner joint turning out strictly mediocre Americanized Chinese fare for take-out only. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that it has been transformed into a sit-down restaurant serving exhilaratingly spicy and flavorful Sichuan dishes.

With two dining partners, I sampled the dan dan noodles, the garlic eggplant, and the Sichuan prawns. The noodles were pleasantly chewy and luxuriously bathed in the sesame-rich sauce studded with bits of ground pork. The eggplant had a tinge of sweetness nicely countered by the sharp garlic and swirls of chili oil. The prawns were dry-fried with several cups of dried chilis. The fresh sweetness of the shrimp balanced perfectly with the saltiness and spice of its seasonings.

The service was friendly and prompt, and our server checked on us several times to make sure we were pleased with our meal and to see if we needed anything further.

The New How Lee is a wonderful addition to the Squirrel Hill food scene and I'd be more than happy to dine there again."}
{"text":"Been craving for good sichuan food in Pittsburgh, and last nite found an awesome one!!

As mentioned by Cara J. below, they changed the management, and most likely their chef as well. Go for the spicy food at the back page where all marked in red, and treat yourself to piles of pepper corns and pool chilli.

We ordered chongqing hot chicken and fish fillet soup w/ soft tofu, and they are just perfect. We counted the dry chilli they put into the dish and found 50 of them...

Looking forward to try other dishes on their menu!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and they said it would take 25 minutes. Arrived about 20 minutes after I called and sat there for over a half hour. Some of the worst takeout timing I've ever experienced. Also, the cashier tried to small talk me at the end as damage control. In addition, they leave all the prepared soup and rice for takeout sitting at the cashier. This sacrifices the heat of the meal just so packing takeout orders can be easier for them. The food was subpar, as far as Chinese goes. General Tso was a little spongey, and my girlfriends chicken Lo Mein was very tasteless and bland. Probably will not return. Only chose this place for it's proximity to her house."}
{"text":"I have been disappointed with delivery food lately. Only bright side, Chinese food delivery was fast. Though even the delivery being fast can't make up for the poor desire of good food. I won't order again. The orange chicken and fried rice combo - the fried rice was hard, and the orange chicken had way too much breading (you could tell it was frozen). 
Will not order again."}
{"text":"Chongqing chicken and dried hot pot fish: excellent, highly recommended. Some places the chicken and fish were little but they served generous portions at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Consistently great food.   We've had the typical fare as well as some of the authentic/special dishes.   Never a disappointment in the bunch.  

As far as favorites, the dandan noodles are a must, the dumplings are really good, and amazing chicken is quite amazing :)

They've also been courteous at all times even when we called in way too close to closing."}
{"text":"Are you guys serious? My meal here was the saltiest thing I've ever had, and Greasy, too... I felt sick after eating here. Bad food and bad service. 
I left feeling somewhat ripped off and disrespected."}
{"text":"4 years of college, Ive always ordered delivery from this place.  The food is average but its served me well... 5 stars for my loyalty."}
{"text":"The best and most authentic Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Their authentic Sichuan cuisine is to die for.  I come here usually once a week and highly recommend it. Food is great, atmosphere is good, and great service."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite Chinese place in Pittsburgh. Make sure you check out the Szechuan menu on the last page if you like spicy food. I'd recommend the Chongching chicken and the cumin lamb."}
{"text":"For people who love spicy food -this may be the best in Pitt!"}
{"text":"The food used to be better and you didn't have to fish the protein out of your main dish.  My problem is their lack of attention.  Food for two and you get one fortune cookie. Or they mix the size in your order....just frustrating by the time you get home and realize the mistake.  Not going back anytime soon!!"}
{"text":"This is from a few months ago but I echo the good reviews. 

Looked after being seated and realized all the other patrons were hipster-nerdy asian college students. Not kidding. We joked that we must be in the right place. 

Everyone has already put up enough pictures of the hot dishes--I'll simply agree that it was hot, authentic-tasting, and hits the spot. 

My contribution will be a note on the Xihu Niu Rou Gen (we were all glad to order that--for those who weren't prepared for how hot the spicy food was--it was a lifesaver for sure), which is a clear and starchy beef soup. Chinese watercress was also great (I was delighted they still had  this in late November, usually it's out of season by late August/September). It tasted very good, but they didn't cut up the stems much.

It gets a stamp of approval though, and is a reliable choice for real, spicy Sichuan style food of the \"ma la\" variety. One thing they could've improved was to refill the water more frequently. I mean, if your food is going to be burning up our mouths...we need some relief! (To be fair, business was great, so I could understand the waitresses were quite busy.)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Food is great and the staff is very friendly. This restaurant is a little far from me but it is well worth the drive."}
{"text":"I found this place by searching Yelp before a trip to Pittsburgh. The friend I was going with prefers Asian cuisine over anything else, so the pictures of the food here totally sold us. It was VERY good! The Dan Dan noodles are incredible. And we loved the braised tofu with mushroom and bamboo--would have liked a bit more mushroom. Pictures of this from a previous Yelp post is exactly what sold us on coming here. I personally would have liked a little spice, but still VERY good. The pork fried rice had large pieces of pork--which I don't care for-- and wasn't super flavorful, but it was still good. The broth to the wonton soup was good. The dry-cooked green beans were addictive. The service was pleasant. Overall, we would definitely recommend and come back."}
{"text":"My family and I visited  a college not far. We  were going to another restaurant but this one was on the path. It was cold and we were hungry. So we went to this restaurant. The service was fast. The food was not bad. We had our typical American version Chinese food; general tso, beef n broccoli, etc. 

To our surprise, the food was very delicious and filling. My truth test of good food is how does it make you feel afterwards. Low quality food make me feel sleepy. Wife gets heads because  most low quality food have lots of MSG.

We didn't feel any of those symptoms during our 3 hour trip too home."}
{"text":"How did I never review this place before? ONLY order off the traditional Sichuan style menu on the back page, and you cannot lose. We eat here so often. My fav items are The Chingqing dumplings and I always reserve the sauce it's in to put over the rice since it is SO good. I love the beef and fish hotpots (this is the only meal I prefer in restaurant than take out).  The baby bokchoy is garlic heaven, and the stir fried green beans  and salty and pork-y. The eggplant is also good as is the spicy dry hot chicken.  We have never gone wrong with the Sichuan menu; plus ask a server for a suggestion.  Ooooh, and it is byob."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the WORST Chinese meal I have ever eaten.  I ate about half of the sweet & sour chicken only because I was very hungry; the rest went into the disposal. The chicken was very dry and the breading was tough and rubbery.  Very little in the way of vegetables.  The egg roll was the same, dry and tasteless.  The soup was a strange shade of yellow and again, you guessed it, tasteless.  My wife had egg foo young which was excellent."}
{"text":"We have had takeout from here on several occasions.  Delivery is always fast and the food is consistently good.   It's not amazing, but in the Squirrel Hill area, I think it's one of the best Chinese options."}
{"text":"I was so surprised to see that this place didn't have 4.5-5 stars on yelp. I did a quick skim, and it seems like most of the negative reviews are for the Americanized menu. Don't come here for that! I love me some good comforting General Tso's, but as far as I'm concerned, these people wanted to open an authentic sichuan restaurant but didn't want to exclude the majority of Pittsburgh's population and had to offer Americanized food they don't particularly care about. 

But the Sichuan menu... This is THE place in this half the state to get authentic Chinese food. Even my mom approves of this place. The food comes quick, though there is often a wait crowding the door on weekend dinner hours and service can get inattentive at those times. It's a hit with all the international students, so you KNOW it's good. All my favorite Sichuan dishes (shui zhu yu, garlic eggplant, yu xiang rou si, fu qi fei pian, dried green beans, spicy beef noodle soup, etc)  are all top notch here. The right balance of good flavor and that nasty spicy kick that I have  such a love-hate relationship with. We've also never gone wrong with anything else we've tried off of the authentic menu. The prices are very reasonable for Pittsburgh, too. The 'burgh has been missing a place like this, and How Lee definitely rose to the occasion."}
{"text":"Ethnic food in Pittsburgh is a bit disappointing, but this restaurant is really excellent - provided you choose from the wonderful Szechuan menu and you like spicy food. It's not quite Chinatown in NYC or Anaheim in LA, but it is very good. The hot pots burn (I had the mutton pot last time) and paralyze your tongue as they should and the veggies are very tasty (i had the peppers and the egg plant recently).

Update 02/02/2011
I ate there twice recently, and overall I am pleased with the quality of the food. The egg plant with a garlic sauce is tasty and not spicy - this will be welcome if some around your table are sensitive to spices. The tongue and tripes with spicy vinaigrette - an appetizer - were better than the first time I took the dish: the sauce was denser and less watery. The hot chili peppers were not as spicy as expected, but they were delicious (I have had them twice already - no disappointment there)."}
{"text":"On Forbes Ave. in Squirrel Hill.  Across the street from the Kosher Dunkin Donuts.  I like the food here.  It has your standard Americanized type fried rice and other Chinese type fare.  And it has the good stuff!

Beef tendon, different interior bits of the cow and pig.  All meals I have had have been very good so far.  And nicely priced.  

No meals I want to specifically point to as exceptionally good.  All of the food is really really good.  Go to the restaurant, and get anything.  Start with the familiar, and then get adventurous.  The interior is nicely decorated, but it is not a place to take someone to unless you know the other person likes to find authentically prepared Chinese dishes.  

Items you do not find on your standard Chinese strip plaza type spot.  I like the place, and having it right in Squirrel Hill, makes it convenient.  I have never had any problem finding parking.  I usually just park on Murray."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh! 

PROS:
If you are Chinese and love spicy food, this is the place for you. Their fried chicken and fish fillet are very tasty and spicy. Try out the new jelly noodles as well! It's so good!
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

I never tried the dishes that Americans usually order (general tso's chicken, orange chicken etc.) so I don't know how this restaurant holds up in American's eyes.

The food is usually clean and fresh, which can be an issue with other Chinese restaurant. 


CONS:
The restaurant is so tiny! There is usually a line during weekends and the restaurant is tightly packed. The tables are too close to each other that sometimes it can get a little uncomfortable. The whole place is just very crowded in general. Not a great place for a quiet date night.

Delivery food doesn't taste as good as in the restaurant, but that's not the restaurant's issue."}
{"text":"Words of my beloved sister's friend:
\"The service is bad, the store is sketchy, the people are rude, and worst of all they can't even speak chinese!
My issue with this 'chinese' restaurant stems from the fact that 'Chow Mein' supposedly means 'rice with tasteless white sauce'! 'Chow Fun' also supposedly means 'skinny, burnt egg noodle'! Correct me if i'm wrong but i'm pretty sure that 'mein' means noodle in chinese!
When Ingrid and I ordered food from this restaurant, through the beloved Campusfood.com, our order was intentionally replaced with revolting rice and egg noodles! We were insulted! and hurt! and offended! We were in disbelief when Ingrid called the restaurant to settle the manner, when to our wondering ears did appear, but ignorance and incompetence! The woman argued with her about how WE made a mistake, that 'chow mein' means 'rice and white sauce', which we fervently argued against. We brought forward a witness who spoke fluent cantonese, mandarin, shanghainese, etc.
After discussing the issue, and proving that mein actuality MEANS NOODLE, she refused to give us a refund or deliver the correct order.
We would like your support in our endeavor in not supporting HOW LEE and their treacherous methods of butchering the chinese cuisine and dialects.
We should have known not to open the bag when we met the white delivery man with a chinese accent. SKETCH\""}
{"text":"I order delivery from here almost every Friday at work. They are fast and have great lunch specials. The sweet and sour chicken is always delicious. I have liked everything that I have tried here."}
{"text":"As a visitor from LA, it's hard to say any Chinese food in Pittsburgh is good. With limit choices, I should give my highest score to how lee. 

Some food there remind me the time back in LA. The spicy chicken is a must try entree here. Among others, lumb and double cooked pork slides are awesome. 

Service is so so but not bad. You know that's very common in a Chinese restaurant. Lunch special is very affordable. 

If it's in LA, I may only rate it 3-3.5 or so, but in Pittsburgh, it's definitely 4.5-5 given the limited choices here."}
{"text":"I have been there twice, I think they have different chef for dinner and lunch, my dinner experience there was amazing! Authentic Sichuan food!!"}
{"text":"stop. collaborate and listen. 

this place is effing delicious. i wanted to order like ten portions of the eggplant so that i could eat it for the next week. sadly, i was on a work-related road trip so i was unable to make this happen. oh yeah, and it's make-your-nose-run spicy, which i personally LOVE. we also ordered cold noodles (another hit) and some sort of spicy crispy chicken. unfortunately i don't know the chinese name for the dish, so you're on your own with that one. 

it's a little pricey, but because i am having withdrawls from good, authentic chinese food having just moved from california to ohio - it was worth every penny. plus my friends paid for it so that was kind of a non-issue and made it taste even better!

just fyi, though, there is one downside: fiery poops. 
(you've been warned)"}
{"text":"Turn to the back page of the menu, order from this page only, enjoy authentic Sichuan cuisine.  It's the best Chinese food I've had out outside of China or San Fran.  The dry fried long beans, ma po tofu, twice-cooked pork, and tea smoke duck are all excellent.  Be careful, though, they are not shy with the Sichuan peppercorns.  It's one of the reasons I love it, but it may not be for everyone.  This is not just heat for heat's sake, but very complex layers of flavor and heat.  The tea smoked duck is a great option for those that don't love the fire.  

It is nicer inside than it appears from the street and the service is always good.

I have never ordered from the rest of the menu and have heard mixed reviews from friends."}
{"text":"Tried out based on referral. Order with someone with poor English name \"E\" it didn't go well. I drive to get order, she claimed to be one of the owners... however she didn't make me feel like I should spend my money, when I ordered people overheard my comical conversation with her. She didn't seem to care about customer service, she just wanted my $$...based on that why should they get my $$... ordered canceled and now typing, I will never give them my $$ why should u?"}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh inner city area. Sometimes, its hard for me to believe that there is even such a restaurant with authentic Chengdu cooking in Pittsburgh. Make sure you order from the Sichuan menu. It is what all the Chinese people go there for."}
{"text":"How Lee appears to be your mild mannered mom-and-pop restaurant, but underneath this simple veneer lies a very spicy eatery. The service is a little unpolished, and the decor is a bit dated. More important, it's authentic Szechuan food is excellent. The ma po tofo is cooked to perfection. Not for the faint of stomach. Chillies are tossed into most dishes with wild abandon. 

Lunch is very cheap, even for Pittsburgh. A meal for 4, including an appetizer, costs about $30 with tip."}
{"text":"I used to eat at How lee when it was a small \"fast food\" Chinese dinner some years back when I lived in Squirrel Hill. It was pretty cheap and the food was great. 

Since the owner decided to renovate the restaurant and try to make it a \"classy\" Chinese dinner, not only the prices doubled but the quality of the dishes became worse. There is inconsistency (all the time) with: 1)  Portions;  2) Sauce (quantity and taste);  3) How well the meats are cooked (got my chicken raw on last visit). Most important is the attitude of the owner towards the customers and some of the girls that work there. 

In one occasion, I ordered \"chicken with mixed vegetables\" and the carrots were sour and saggy with bad smell (seemed to be left overs from previous day). When I explained this to the owner (on another visit, 3 weeks later) she insisted that there is nothing wrong with her dishes and became aggressive, then concluded that I must have been mistaken. On another occasion, I asked the girl on the front desk for some extra soy sauce (packed in small plastic packages) and she refused to give me saying that my meal (carry out) included one pack. I was surprised!!

Bottom line, overly priced place with a lady owner that is rude towards customers trying to get the money spent on renovation from customers pockets."}
{"text":"Good straightforward Chinese food with some authentic Sichuan dishes. Very good for take out or delivery. Prices are reasonable, food is freshly cooked- much better than you might think from looking at it."}
{"text":"I come here for the Szechuan food..Never had the regular Chinese here but the szechuan has been Really good.
If you can HANDLE next level spicy- I would recommend Cumin Beef or Tri Pepper Chicken."}
{"text":"Dirty. Greasy. I got sick. There are so many better options available in Squirrel Hill, so don't even bother going here."}
{"text":"I hear you like Sichuan peppers so we put some sichuan peppers on your sichuan peppers.  For Pittsburgh, this place is top notch for authentic Sichuan food.  This review is only for the Sichuan food- don't bother even ordering non-Sichuan food, it's not worth it.

From the pork belly and leeks to the green beans to the hot fried chicken and the cumin beef  to the ma po tofu, the dishes are deliciously smattered with sichuan peppers and oil.  It'll definitely test your spice tolerance.  Your go to for Sichuan cravings in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic!

Very good for spicy food. beef appetizer was good, forgot what else I got"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a little expensive, but I still really love it.

I have left Pittsburgh for over half a year but I still miss it. I even asked my GF who is still there in college to bring some food from How Lee on flight.

I would recommand the Sichuan Style Chicken(name may not be inaccurate....but you got the idea:P), and BTW, the hot and sour soup here is the best I have ever had, give it a try:)"}
{"text":"Stick with the authentic menu and you'll find one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh.  If you can't handle the spice they have an american-chinese menu too although I can't vouch for the quality on that.    My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The hubster and I finally made it in here to make a comparison between China Star and How Lee. The service here is incredibly friendly and accommodating, and they clearly are used to dealing with English speaking clientele.

Surprisingly, the servers were Cantonese. I liked this because I could speak with them without much trouble, but this is where I thought the food might have been a bit lacking. We got our usual, which is fish fillets in spicy broth and pea shoots. The pea shoots were a bit on the tough side (might just have been due to what was available) and we were able to get the fish fillets a bit more mild than usual. Maybe getting it mild was where we went wrong - Sad to say, but the fish fillets at China Star are significantly better. Allow me to explain just a bit - the fish fillet dish at How Lee's was a bit ... cantonesed (i.e., they had thickened up the soup base with corn starch, which is a pretty typical cantonese thing to do). Also, the fish fillets were a bit on the doughy side, which I think probably had everything to do with the fish they used. 

Anyway, this is not a crazy indictment - it was still really good Chinese food, especially by Pittsburgh standards. I especially liked it because I could actually speak with the servers. But if you're looking for really authentic Szechuan food, I'd recommend China Star over this."}
{"text":"After reading numerous positive, almost glowing reviews her on Yelp, I decided to give How Lee a try.  Boy, am I glad I did.  I stopped by on a Friday afternoon (still able to catch the lunch menu which ends at 3).  Boy, this is the Cantonese food for which I have been searching!

Authentic, plentiful and tasty!  I chose the Shrimp and Scallops Szechuan Style.  The lunch specials come with your choice of Wonton or Egg Drop or Hot and Sour Soup.  i chose the Hot and Sour Soup which was outstanding, just enough bite at the back of your tongue to remind you why it's called 'hot\" and sour.  The lunch portions are quite generous.  I took my order to go and there was enough food for a light dinner the next night.

I also chose two traditional eggs rolls.  They weren't bad, just uninteresting.  Perhaps a few water chestnuts or something with crunch would have made them more interesting.

All in all, excellent Chinese food and I'm sure I will be back often."}
{"text":"Not a bad option if you're looking for some quick grub in the Squirrel Hill area. Their lunch specials are decent; I usually get the Chicken w/ Brocolli and it hits the MSG spot. (Ha.)

Stay away from their Lo Mein though... meh."}
{"text":"The authentic Sichuan food here is nothing short of fabulous!!! I find traditional Americanized Chinese food only okay, so I was so incredibly happy to find the Sichuan menu here to be a huge step up over typical Chinese food. I LOVE the Chongqing spicy hot chicken. There must be crack in it, because I can't seem to stop eating it. It's a wonderful dish with complex yet delicious flavors. The pork belly with leeks - so delicious!!! The green bean dish was delicious also! I can't wait to try more of their Sichuan dishes, as we seek How Lee out more often for date night! We have been in search of food that compares to the Sichuan from How Lee that is closer to home in the South Hills, and our pursuits have come up short. So off to Squirrel Hill for more How Lee!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of spicy Chinese food so my expectations are always really high when I eat a Chinese restaurants. I've been here twice now and both times I've been super pleased with their food. Other Chinese restaurants  in Pittsburgh just can't compare with How Lee's balance of spice and flavor. The first time, I had their spicy beef tripe, spicy cold noodles, and spicy fish fillet. All three dishes met my expectations and I even took the fish fillet sauce home for my own food. The second time, I had their spicy green bean jelly, extra spicy fish chili pot (see a pattern?), and flat rice noodles to balance out the taste (and to give my girlfriend a break from all of the spice). In between the first and second time, I tried my hand at other Pittsburgh Chinese restaurants and was never fully satisfied each time. How Lee is a game changer, and I am confident that I won't have to worry too much if I order from their dedicated Sichuan menu."}
{"text":"How Lee is the best, most authentic Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, hands down.  If you want sugary, greasy, heavy American takeout, don't come here.  Order off the Sichuan menu.  The eggplant in garlic sauce in particular is incredible. The service is fast, even when crowded and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"As someone who has had authentic Chinese food but also enjoys American-Chinese food, this place is just fine. I've only ever gotten take out from this place, so here are the dishes I recommend:

1. I enjoy the Chongqing dry hot chicken, it's like spicy small bits of fried chicken, half meat, but the other half of the container is red peppers. This is often too spicy for most other people I enjoy dining with.  There are Schezwan peppercorns in this, which make your tongue go slightly numb and feel lemony. So good!  You'll probably feel iffy ordering it, because the name sounds like a bad, racist Rosie O'Donnell joke. 

2. Eggplant in garlic sauce. Huge fan of this vegetarian dish. So flavorful. The eggplant has the wonderful firm but slimy texture. 

3. My partner loves getting the salt and pepper chicken. It's small bits of fried chicken, similar to the chongqing chicken, but this dish is sweet but black peppery. Always a hit. 

4.  Lastly, we like to get veggie hor fun, because the name applies to us, and the noodles are so wide and delightfully chewy!

I am only giving this place 3 stars because the portion sizes to go seem small to me, for the price. The food has never wowed me, just been alright / good enough to go back to them."}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese in the city. We order take out for pickup all the time since we're not close enough for delivery. But it's always well worth it. 

I'm a big fan of the Ginger Chicken, and crab rangoons never disappoint. My wife loves the Gen Tso combo (their chicken fried rice is great). And the pork fried dumplings always disappear fast."}
{"text":"After going here for about a thousand times, I finally realized I never reviewed this place. Sorry How Lee!!

Overall, great authentic spicy Chinese food. Just make sure you order from the very back/last page of their menu if you're looking for the spciy/authentic food. Some of the things I like to order everytime I go there include, the hot chilli pot (option of fish, lamb, beef, etc), ChongQing fried chicken (sorry I don't actually know the legit name),  beef boiled in spicy oil dish (again don't remember the English name, it's called Shui Zhu Niu in Chinese), etc. Bascially, most of their spicy food are pretty good!

However, I do want to point out, their stir fried potato dish is no longer as good as it used ot be! :( The last time I went, it was sliced as big as the size of my pinky (almost)!!! That was pretty disappointing. Hope they get that issue resolved....
But the good news is, this is not going to stop me from coming back (yet)! Just get your tissues/napkins ready to blow your nose!

And their service overall is pretty fast!"}
{"text":"Good food, cheap, and fast. Good lunch special selection includes choice of rice and choice of soup."}
{"text":"I have been to How-Lee twice for pick-up, as I work right down the street. First, let me say this: I do not like Chinese food. I have had the most Americanized, disgusting experiences with it since I was a child, and have therefore sworn off the cuisine entirely. That was, until I tried out How-Lee. On my first visit, I got the orange chicken. I believe they must have misunderstood me and given me General Tso's, because that stuff had some KICK! I got the combination plate with chicken fried rice and an egg roll. Both were what I expect on average from an American Chinese joint. On my most recent visit, I decided to switch it up and get the Kung Po chicken with steamed white rice. Holy cow. From the veggies, to the sauce, to the chicken, this stuff was amazing. I was eating vegetables without having them hidden in a sauce. Amazing. 10/10. Hot, but not too hot. Have a glass of water handy. Overall great experience for someone who has been otherwise scorned by Pittsburgh Chinese food."}
{"text":"My mom was craving authentic Chinese food and we looked up a bunch of places on Yelp and this seemed to be the best one. We weren't wrong! I'm so glad we tried How Lee. Their specialty is Szechuan food. We tried a little bit of everything but they also appeal to anyone who wants \"regular\" Chinese, as well. 

We started with the Dan Dan noodles and scallion pancake. The Dan Dan noodles weren't as spicy as I thought they would be, which was good for me because too spicy isn't a favorite. The noodles were silky and had great texture. I also enjoyed the pancake, as it wasn't heavy, it was crispy and light. 

We ordered the green beans, tofu chili pot and the twice cooked pork belly with veg. All of the dishes were tasty and it was a different kind of taste, one that I have never had before because all of the Chinese I've had is very Americanized. The waitress actually took the time to show us the chili's and peppercorns used in the dishes, so the service was great! 

The tofu chili pot was absolutely filled with chili's and fried tofu and veggie goodness. I couldn't even describe to you half of the veggies that were in the pot, as I've never had them before but it was delicious. They also put fresh cilantro on top, which made the dish for me. It was spicy (and they toned it down for me). The pork belly was sliced super thin, not a texture I enjoy but the taste was great. My mom loved it. The bok choy was cooked perfectly - it was crunchy and flavorful, which is rare for bok choy, I feel. This is exactly how I would also describe the green beans. These were the star of the show. They tasted lemony and crisp and full of t. I can't wait to have the left overs of them. I could rave about them for a long time. 

We will definitely be back again! Great location, clean restaurant, nice staff and great food!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for lunch. Nice big portions and reasonable prices. The food is always hot and tasty just like I like it.  The waiters and waitresses are really friendly as well as the owners. I always enjoy going there."}
{"text":"3.5/4 stars - Ordered a few dishes for dinner; delivery was prompt, order was correct, price was reasonable. The kung pao chicken was yummy, as was the triple delight. The steamed dumplings were especially delicious - the texture of the dough was perfect. Overall, I was impressed enough that this would be my new go-to for Chinese food delivery (knocking China Palace out of that spot)."}
{"text":"I've been coming here more and more often.  Mostly I order take-out or delivery.  I've really changed my attitude towards this place.  I had a not so great service 1 other time, but since then whenever I'm here everyone else has been nothing but nice.  

The food here is delicious and the portions are fair, prices are bit on the high side especially since they increased their prices on most dishes by $1, but they are far one of the best and most authentic spicy Sichuan restaurants in Pitt.  

Again, I cannot stress how much yummier entrees on the 'Authentic' menu is.  

Happy eating!!!"}
{"text":"I have only been here twice, and found the sauces used both times were very bland and tasteless. Service was fine, price comparable to similar fast food Chinese places  and the food was fair. As a bonus, they offer brown rice, which was nice."}
{"text":"This is another place I don't want to like, but do. The first time I ever ate at How Lee was after my boyfriend ordered take out and I stopped by to pick it up after work. I went it and said the order was either under \"Chris or Alex\" (because my boyfriend and I do not have a system worked out about which name to put down on food orders.) I told them I wasn't sure how he had ordered when they asked if it was online or by phone, and they seemed really confused. They also told me that they had talked to me on the phone and told me that I need to pay extra money for the extra rice. I told them that I didn't speak to them but my boyfriend had told me that we owned extra and I was fine being charged for it. Then they told me I could only pay cash and I couldn't have the extra charge added to my order. I didn't have cash so I told the two people who asked me maybe two three times that \"no, I still don't have any cash.\" I offered to leave the rice and they awkwardly gave it to me anyway. So that was my first experience. The whole visit picking up food was like some annoying \"Who's on first\" skit.

But the food has always been really good and it's never been awkward like that again. I've had the sweet and sour shrimp on multiple occasions and I'm always happy. They're consistent and the prices are decent as well."}
{"text":"My Goodness. This place makes the best Chinese food ever. The food isn't too oily despite it being Szechuan, which is really hard to come by, and it is definitely authentic-tasting. So eager to come back again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I's go-to neighborhood restaurant.

I love their Chongqing chicken....fried morsels of chicken w/ fresh garlic, peppercorns and chili peppers. And their beef noodle soup. 

We usually share dan dan noodles too!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy stopping here on the way back to the Pittsburgh airport. Great food as you might guess from the crowd. Reasonable prices and nice area. Parking can be tricky, but keep looking."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise.  The hubby and I went there today for lunch.  I'm a vegetarian and ordered from the Sichuan menu.  The food was super fresh and without the thick gelatinous sauce that I detest!  Very tasty.  Two thumbs up.  Will return to try more of the authentic menu!

Note that this used to be one of those take-out places with pictures of the menu on the wall.  They completed a major renovation and now have a portion of the menu dedicated to authentic Sichuan food.  The wait staff was super attentive (but not overbearing).  Overall, it was a great first experience."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese take-out place. I love the beef with broccoli because it is made with real beef, not mystery meat. A friend tells me that this is the best, most authentic Sichuan spot in Pittsburgh. I will have to order something off of the Sichuan menu next time.

I know it sounds silly, but the rice is always fluffy, which I love love love. I have ordered the chicken and shrimp with cashews, the kung pao shrimp, the veggie delight, and of course the beef with brocolli. All were fantastic, and I would order all of those options again.

I love the vegetable dumplings to start with, as well as the crab Rangoon. They literally melt in your mouth-dangerous to be sure.

I have never eaten in the restaurant, but there is plenty of seating in the restaurant, and the takeout service has always been efficent and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I think their food is pretty fantastic. And they're spicy mapo tofu is really good and spicy dry chicken. My friends come here often and I love their lunch special combo with egg rolls"}
{"text":"I was hungover as hell and there was a blizzard/polar vortex going on and a Saturday night, needless to say I wasn't leaving the couch...  So I decided to order from here for delivery, they explained it would be an hour and I was more than OK with that because it was a Saturday night and a blizzard.

The food arrived and was still extremely hot and fresh even though it was 3 degrees outside.  I ordered off the Szechwan menu and everything was banging.  I got an order of spicy dumplings and completely destroyed them and an order of Dan Dan noodles.  The main entree was the qonguin spicy chicken with the peppers or however you spell it.  It was a huge portion and very spicy which was cool because it helped me sweat all that poison out from the night before.  There was a ton leftover for later.

Great food and service during a blizzard."}
{"text":"Since my last review, I feel like How Lee has kind of gone downhill.  The dan dan noodles have been overcooked (mushy) the last few times, and I probably won't get them again.  Fool me thrice, shame on me.

The twice cooked pork belly with capsaicin is still good, and my favorite dish at the restaurant.  We tried the chongqing chicken, but it was so oily and OVERLY peppery (yes, I know it's Sichuan food but this was over the top) that it was too much.

The best thing that How Lee does is the salt and pepper shrimp (sichuan style).  The sichuan peppercorns are ground up and put into the batter and the result is delicious and numbing.

I'm still hopeful that How Lee will make a valiant comeback.  It's still 3 stars, but with a bit more attention to detail they could be 4-5.

Hopefully with China Star now open (and competing) down the street, we'll all be the winners!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Moo Shoo Vegetable and found pork in the dish. Not cool for a vegetarian."}
{"text":"I was bummed out from the very start of this meal.  I went to dine at How Lee's around 12:30pm and to my dismay they were only serving the lunch menu.  I ordered the shrimp and scallops which was served with a soup I choose the wanton soup.  

My shrimp and scallops came out a little too fast like no sooner had my choice left my lips did the food arrive at my table.  There were literally only 3 other patrons in the restaurant and I don't know why the chef felt the need to nook my food.  

I can get better tasting and more freshly prepared Chinese food from China Taste on East Ohio Street. 

My star rating can potentially go higher after I have had an opportunity to sample How Lee's dinner menu."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it was quick! I ordered crispy shrimp with broccoli and it was delicious. This might just become my new favorite place to order from"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a Chinese co-worker when I was looking for a good Chinese place for my visiting Chinese in-laws.

My review can be summed up using the immortal words of Randy Moss... \"straight cash homies.\" I have officially found my go-to chinese restaurant in The Burgh. We ordered several dishes for all of us to share from both the \"American\" menu and the \"Authentic\" menu. Everyone was more than happy with the food."}
{"text":"I got takeout from this place a while ago for lunch when I pass by. It was fast, authentic and tasty. I haven't checkout there dinner yet but I've heard that this is one of the most authentic Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Maybe I will check it out soon."}
{"text":"Good food and quick service. This has been a long standing restaurant in am area that has seen a lot of changes over the years. The real challenge is parking but there is a public parking lot nearby so when possible use it to avoid the headache. I Had shrimp with black bean sauce and found it a bit pricey. A large was $14. It's a great dish and I would get it again but I am curious to see the price of a small portion. I'll go back I've been a fan of theirs for years."}
{"text":"Great place for simple American Asian food for dine in or take out. The service is quick and pleasant and you receive a healthy portion.

My gen tso chicken combination plate came with an eggroll appetizer which was piping hot, however a tad too peppery for my taste. Was served with duck sauce. The combination platter came quickly after that, served with chicken fried rice. I asked for their \"spicy\" version which was a small kick for my wimpy taste buds, but if you don't eat the chili peppers you will not be wheezing in any way of form.

Perfect. The waitress was very polite and courteous anticipating needs and making sure we were happy. 

How Lee also has quick turnaround for their take out service which I believe can be delivery."}
{"text":"Disgusting. 

Oily. 

No seasoning. 

My husband just picked up $60 of take out. After sampling each item I found unhappy similarities. Salt apparently is unheard of. Grease is abundant. And how the heck do you mess up fried rice?!?! My hot and sour soup was tasteless and vinegary. $10 for steamed veggies in soy sauce? Soggy chow fun. Pork filling in the dumplings was just pork. Egg roll greasy and doughy.

bleeeeeech. 

Never again. Can I have our $$ back? Also could someone bring me dinner as this was inedible. 

Update
We called and they said if we brought back the food they would either remake the food ( um no thanks) or refund us. So we trekked back to sq hill. The jerks only refunded for the uneaten portions. $28. They were pretty anal and rude. So....yeah. Never again."}
{"text":"Best Sichuan food in Pittsburgh. Not a fan though."}
{"text":"Yet another place that I'd not been to even though it's practically around the corner from me.  I'd been working around the house on a Friday morning and I decided to get some take-out for lunch.

I ordered the chicken with mixed vegetables and it made for a tasty, satisfying lunch.  The chicken was tender and the vegetables weren't mushy.  My hot and sour soup was so good on an otherwise *icky* day.

How Lee is a typical Chinese neighborhood joint with the usual weekday lunch specials (I.E. with choice of rice and soup). I think that if you tick to the basics at a place like this, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Went to How Lee with the whole family for dinner on a visit to Pittsburgh and man, it was so good. Recommended by a friend, this was one of the most authentic Chinese food experiences I've encountered. We ordered strictly off of the Szechuan menu and got things like cucumber with scallion sauce and diced rabbit for starters. For the main courses, we got a little bit of everything, but the stand out was the beef tendon. It was spiced perfectly and wonderfully tender as it was probably cooked all day. This place is not your generic American-Chinese place with congealed sauces and artificially flavored dishes, but a more authentic experience that, for me, has only been paralleled in my hometown of Los Angeles"}
{"text":"They deliver, what more can you want? 
They're solid classic Chinese food. I've tried the Tso's, Mongolian beef, beef lo mein, and egg drop soup. All exactly what I expected, exactly what I wanted.
Be forewarned I tried a 4/5 pepper spiciness dish from the traditional menu (chengdu I believe). It was 60% hot peppers, 40% chicken, and nothing else. Blew my socks off and I can handle spicy."}
{"text":"The Sichuan menu is amazing!!
The spicy fish Jianbei style is so awesome. The serving size was huge with perfect spices. The scallion sauce cucumber appetizer and the fish in spicy broth were great too. The food is a bit on the oily side but this will not deter me from going to this place again.
In the evenings the wait time is not too bad and the service is quite efficient. The regular Chinese menu looked alright but one must try their Sichuan food."}
{"text":"Amazing!  This place may not look like much but man oh man is the food good!  Make sure to order from the authentic Szechuan menu.  They also have an American Chinese food menu with is the same crap that you get at any other \"Chinese restaurant\"   The food on the Szechuan menu is really something.  We always go here with a co-worker of mine who live in China and he just orders a bunch of stuff for us and it is always so so good.

My favorite by for is the \"hot dry chicken\" mmmmmmm!!!!"}
{"text":"Took 1 hour 40 minutes for delivery. OK, so then I get a text \"Food is here\", and immediately go downstairs to find the food left in the entryway to me building... Open the bag, no friend wanton noodles for the wonton soup. The one plus was that the orange chicken tasted fine, but it was totally mushy and soft. I'm not sure how this place gets a good rating if this is their standard."}
{"text":"Ok don't get me started!!! The Chingqing dumplings at How Lee are out of this world. Get adventurous and ONLY order off the traditional Sichuan style menu on the back page.

Favorite items: beef with Chinese hot pepper, stir fried green beans with no pork, Mala eggplant, chongqing dry hot chicken (get a big side of duck sauce for dipping), Sichuan style kung pow. 

The fried egg rolls here are *the best* in the city of Pittsburgh- so fresh.

I love going here- the service is great and the owners seem like very nice people."}
{"text":"Me and my two other friends went in for a quick lunch and I was pleasantly surprised by the food there. I am a spicy food fanatic. We ordered pig intestine casserole, stir fried kang choy, and fish with tofu. The pig intestines were covered with dried pepper and chili oil, and it was just the right amount of spicy. Yum... The fish was very tender and tasty. One complaint is that the dishes overall were on the greasy and salty side. Aside from that I'd recommend it to spicy food lovers! We each spent 15 bucks or so for three dishes to share. The service could be faster."}
{"text":"Food @ How Lee is decent. I ate here for the first time, my husband & I ordered take out. We split the sweet & sour fish fillets & the vegetable hor fun. Both dishes were good but nothing special. And both dishes were a tad bit greasy. I was disappointed that vegetables did not come with the sweet & sour fish. The fish was too expensive for the amount of food you get. The portion sizes are kind of on the smaller side. An upside is the menu is large & there are a lot a choices."}
{"text":"A couple friends and I got together last night for a girls night and decided to order from How Lee.  I'm always a little worried when ordering delivery for a big group that something goes wrong or is forgotten but I was pleasantly surprised when How Lee got it all right! We ordered a 1 tofu, 2 veggie, and 3 chicken dishes plus egg rolls and everyone raved over how delicious it all was! I ordered the white meat sesame chicken and it was cooked perfectly. The egg roll was really tasty as well. The portions are about what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant, and I brought enough home for another meal. 

2 small gripes. It took a while for delivery and there were no fortune cookies! Wah! I love the crunchy sweetness of a fortune cookie after eating a big meal like that! Oh well, everything else was great and if I were in the area again I would definitely check out How Lee again!"}
{"text":"They need to start a completely fresh Yelp page for How Lee!  I'm not sure if they're under new ownership, or they just finally got their act together, but How Lee is delicious and fresh now!  The inside is completely renovated, and it's always packed.  They have all your usual suspects on the menu, along with a good amount of Schezuan specialties.  The Chendu chicken and double cooked pork  belly are tasty, and the hot & sour soup and spring rolls are good too."}
{"text":"How Lee's is my go-to spot for authentic Szechuan cuisine or want American-Chinese take-out. I have never had anything bad and everything is reasonably priced. Also the people who own and work there are very kind and helpful. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese restaurant, and not only in contrast to the previous establishment (of the same name).

How Lee has both a standard American-Chinese menu and a Schezuan menu. The American menu is great; the dishes are well made, with good ingredients and of nice portion size. I should say that I did find their hot'n sour not as good as Zaw's (bear in mind though that this should be a leftovers soup with maybe different flavors showing up over time; How Lee seems to make it from scratch).

The Schezuan menu is fabulous; I'm still working my way through it. My only comment is that these dishes can be very hot, so know what you're getting yourself into as you order.

I've never had any unpleasant interactions with the staff. As in all such things: treat them nice and they will treat you nice.

One warning: If you order delivery the restaurant adds a steep surcharge (not noted on the flyers). So, eat out or do pick-up."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try How Lee for a while now. It is one of the few places I haven't been to in Sq. Hill. Food was pretty good and the service was good. Some things on the menu were cheap while others were more expensive. It was good middle of the road Chinese food. 3.5-4.0"}
{"text":"As a Chinese who loves extra spicy food, this is the most authentic Szechuan restaurants I've EVER had in the United States. Ironically, sometimes I missed their food when I was in China during vacation... I've stayed in California and New York for a long time, where better Asian food are expected, but NO - nothing I had beats How Lee. It's becoming a reason for me to visit Pittsburgh again.

We ordered their food almost every week during my college years, and the food made me so happy every time that it was seriously a relief for me from an intense week of work.

I've never tried their more Americanized menu, so I couldn't say anything about those, but if you are coming here for the authentic experience, you should go directly to the last page of the menu. I strongly recommend 1. Chengdu/Chongqing Fried Dry Hot Chicken (????????), 2. Fish Filet with Cabbage in Paste Chili (????), 3. Sichuan Style Tofu with Minced Pork (????). These are all VERY spicy, so be aware!"}
{"text":"Went there very frequently when I was a student, never disappointed! All dishes we ordered are as expected and the service was never bad."}
{"text":"I am not a huge Chinese food eater.  I never have been, and it takes a lot for me to LOVE Chinese food.  But How Lee is definitely respectable and fine for dinner.

The highlight of this place is that they have both an American and an authentic menu.  The Tso's chicken I got was fine.  Nothing special but good.  Everyone at my table was happy with their meal.  The portions were large, and the rice was good.

Our servers were very friendly and happy to explain the authentic menu items.  I would like to come back here for lunch, as their specials seem like a good deal.  Otherwise, A-Ok Chinese food in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"I used to love How Lee.... but I have to say it is nowhere near as good as it once was.  It is not bad by any means, but it is not the great food that I remember from years past.  

Portions and flavors have become inconsistent in my opinion.  We have ordered a few times as I was trying to see if it was just a one or two time thing and it appears that it has not been.  Even with something as simple as Chicken and Broccoli!  

I may give it another try and see if things improve and go back to the quality that I was once used to, but with a bunch of other options in the city that I have not explored, it may be awhile."}
{"text":"I have only come here for the $1 soft serve.  When I can't afford the other summer treats on Forbes, I come here.  The sign screams ONE DOLLAR ICE CREAM CONE.

I go in and say \"I want ice cream.  Vanilly.\"  Guy takes my dollar and pumps a cone with vanilla soft serve.  I am happy as I walk out into the bright sunny day.

Can't comment on the food since people have always warned me against it.  But one dollar soft serve, can't beat that.

Of course, my rating skews the review here."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and one of the best Chinese restaurants. Reasonable prices and good service, this place is a must try. My wife and I ordered from the Sichuan menu which was recommended in reviews from others."}
{"text":"Really love this place!!! Authentic Chinese food, very spicy! I will recommend the fish filet! Their spicy fried chicken is also great! Do not come here if you are not a spicy lover; otherwise it will be a bit painful :-/ the price is also okay. I will definitely go here next time!"}
{"text":"Made my stop at How Lee's on my mission to try all of Pittsburgh's Sichuan restaurants (not that it's that lengthy of a journey).  Our party of 4 was seated immediately around 6 on a Sunday night, despite the restaurant being relatively full already upon our arrival.  Our server came by to take our orders and drop off our dishware and food, and we didn't see her after that until she delivered our single check for the table.  Though I wasn't overly surprised at this level of service, it was a bit minimal even for the typical Pittsburgh Chinese restaurant, and my empty teacup was sad because of it.

We ordered the DAN DAN NOODLES, TOFU VEGETABLE SOUP, BRAISED TOFU, SICHUAN STYLE TOFU WITH MINCED PORK, and CHONGQING FRIED DRIED HOT CHICKEN.  Portions were super generous, and this ended up being way too much food for us, as we took most of both tofu dishes home and left the soup on the table.

So, this soup.  I wasn't expecting a masterpiece.  Typically, I just love having a bowl of soup with pretty much any meal.  Super comforting.  But this soup was pretty disappointing--literally the blandest bowl of soup I've ever ordered at any restaurant ever.  Like, I know it's veggie soup, but I had a veggie broth in a pho just last weekend that pretty much knocked my thigh-highs off, so I definitely don't view meatlessness as an excuse for lack of flavor.  This soup was tragically not even seasoned with salt, so I picked some of the veggies out of the (largely portioned, at least) bowl and left all of the sad, sad broth.  I hate wasting food, and it's almost unprecedented for me to not take home my leftovers.  So today was a sad day in my personal history.

I was really excited to try the braised tofu, and this was the one dish that did not disappoint. The soft and luscious tofu, drenched in a flavorful sauce, reminded me of wonderful braised tofu (dou fu nao) Chinese breakfasts my grandma made me growing up, also this tofu was a bit firmer in comparison (only because legit dou fu nao is like flan consistency).  I wish there had been more mushrooms and bamboo slices included, but still, this dish satisfied my expectations.

I feel that any mapo tofu has pretty big shoes to fill, as this is such an iconic dish, and this iteration, while definitely not one of the best I've had, at least somewhat scratched my itch.  There was a good amount of \"ma,\" but it could have been vastly improved with a bit more bean paste for funk, as well as a topping of scallions, which usually add such a fresh bite to this dish.  There were also literally 3 tiny pieces of leek in there, which, to an allium lover, was such a tease.  I don't normally expect leeks in my mapo tofu, but if you're going to do it, do it right, ya know?  Same with the minced pork--I actually prefer a vegetarian mapo tofu, but if you're going to make a porky version, be generous with the piggyness.

The chongqing chicken was found to be pretty disappointing by our whole table.  For a dish that's as hyped up as it is from this place, it entirely underwhelmed us with its tiny pieces of heavily breaded chicken that tasted mostly (and weirdly) of a fishy flavor.  Our 2 fellas at the table picked at it until it was mostly finished (because fried chicken equals man food, apparently, rawr) but it just definitely less awesome than we were expecting.  Like, a lot less awesome.

So I probably won't choose to come back to How Lee's, what with better options in Pittsburgh, but I wouldn't cry about it if someone felt the need to drag me back here either.   Perhaps they were having an off night, or we just didn't order the right things.  However, the options, especially for vegetarians, were simply lacking compared to other Sichuan restos around here.  So, my search for the best Sichuan in Pittsburgh continues."}
{"text":"They definitely have a better idea of how to handle spicy dishes well compared to most Chinese restaurants. The dandan noodles is a must try. There's a hint of peanut taste in there but it doesn't overpower the general flavor of the noodles. The spicy fish fillet tastes amazing. Might have been the best I've had in Pittsburgh so far. My only complaint is that their twice cooked pork tastes a bit too salty and greasy."}
{"text":"I always get delivery from here with my boyfriend. It's always delicious, but it takes a while to get delivered. My only issue is that we couldn't find descriptions of the menu online. Everything I've eaten from here has been yummy, but nothing out of the ordinary or spectacular. I'll continue to order from How Lee, because I know what to expect!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything I've sampled so far from the Sichuan menu is absolutely delicious. The chili pots are my favorite. Their service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Found a 1 inch metal shaving in a container of the Dan Dan noodles... So needless to say I've had better."}
{"text":"For Sichuan style food, this place is decent, but I would usually opt to go to Sichuan Gourmet instead. How Lee's menu is much less extensive, and it usually tends to turn out more expensive as they don't have Yelp or cash discounts (as far as I know). How Lee does have lunch specials, including on weekends, and some good items include the beef tendon, twice-cooked pork, and kung pao chicken.

Usually though, we come here for what has become our favorite item at How Lee: the beef noodle soup. Straight up Sichuan style cooked in red hot chili soup, with tender beef and fresh leaves, these noodles cannot be beat, at least in the Squirrel Hill area. Sichuan Gourmet has several different beef noodle items as well, but they are somewhat inconsistent in their quality, and we have never found that to be a problem at How Lee. Although this is on their Appetizers menu, it is definitely enough for a full meal for one person, and being cheaper than a meal this is very much worth it."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars for their food. One of the most authentic sichuan Chinese food in pittsburgh. But their deliver speed is terrible. I wouldn't even give a star for their delivery service. So, I recommend to eat in."}
{"text":"How lee doesn't have much popularity as Sichuan gourmet or rose tea cafe , but I found it rather nice. I am a fan of spicy sichuan gourmet and how lee has a pretty elaborate Sichuan menu. We had the scallions and spring roll as appetizers. We ordered the Chengdu style diced chicken and the fish hot pot and were happy with both the dishes. Felt like it's not as expensive as Sichuan gourmet as well! Overall liked it and would go there again."}
{"text":"Great food. This is one of the best Asian restaurants East of downtown. I highly recommend them for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite chinese restaurant in Pgh!!! I'll dine here almost every week with my friends!!!"}
{"text":"How Lee is awesome, and a very legit Chinese/Sichuan restaurant (from my whitey perspective). Went out to eat there with two friends on a Saturday night, waited for 15 minutes, and loved being a minority amongst tables of Asians. Servers were nice and quick. 

Fried scallion pancakes off the American menu were homemade and epic. We had the cucumber salad (don't bother, it was bitter - like when cucumbers have that bitter skin). Beef chow fun was delish, though the beef was unsurprisingly un-beef like (but not gross or gristly). Plenty of tasty egg bits and crunchy onions and other things. On the Sichuan menu, we had the sichuan kung pao chicken with peanuts. It was delish, great sauce. We tripped out on the weird taste in our mouths that made water taste totally bizarre. Then I noticed a clove-sized spice in the sauce, chewed on one and half my mouth did something crazy. We asked our server: \"pickled ash, numbs your mouth.\" Sweeeet! I love encountering new shit at a restaurant. I also noted the brilliance of putting in a numbing agent to counter the red chili spice. 

In case you're curious, I Wiki'd pickled ash, and it's PRICKLY ASH. Here's the story: \"The fruit of several species of Zanthoare used to make the spice Sichuan pepper. They are also used as bonsai trees. Historically, the bark was widely used for toothache, colic, and rheumatism.\"

Dinner for three was $42 including tip. Goddamn that's cheap!

Two nights later, even though I'd just bought $60 of organic produce from Whole Foods, I ordered How Lee delivery. Veggie dumplings were delicate and yummy; can't wait to try them in the restaurant. Tea-smoked duck was tasty, smoky, fatty, and worth the try - split it with two others. 

China Palace can now go straight to hell for their uninteresting, bland and overpriced American Chinese.  Go to How Lee, you will also become addicted."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I didn't review this restaurant earlier. This has been my fav chinese spot for years! Even before they remodeled. I usually get the vegetable hor fun or the general tsos tofu. It is nothing super fancy, it is not a big restaurant, but it is just really spot on chinese food, every time. They have a very interesting szechuan menu too in the back of their \"americanized\" menu. The servers are very friendly and so are the owners, who are always up front handling the take outs and phone calls. 

Tonight I stopped in and ordered my usual general tsos tofu. It has a sweet and spicy sauce and the tofu is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I often add extra broccoli. If you are in the squirrel hill area, go to this gem!"}
{"text":"One of the places to go for hot, oily, spicy food that makes up Sichuan cuisine. The other place is Sichuan Gourmet. Both are on par with each other.

Only get things from the Sichuan menu. The Americanized Chinese takeout is not worth it.

Dishes I recommend:

Dandan Noodles
Fu Qi Fei Pian - Beef, tripe, and tongue in chili oil
Mao Xue Wang - Pork Blood, tofu, intestines, tripe and all matter of good things
Shui Zhu Yu - Fish cooked in spicy broth (one of the most popular dishes)
Chuan Bei Liang Fen - Bean Jelly in Spicy Sauce
Anything with Pork Belly"}
{"text":"I ordered food from How Lee because my fav chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh changed owners and is no longer up to par. I ordered around 4:30pm on a Tuesday. Estimated delivery time was 45 minutes, which is average for most places. It had snowed a little and the roads were salted, but I can see taking a little caution, so we gave them an hour and 15 min before we called. I live in Oakland, so we're abt 2 miles away. Our food didn't show up until 6:15 and was lukewarm at best upon arrival. We also found the flavoring to be mediocre compared to others we've tried. We will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"The food I had was really Good so I was just about to be their new daily customer when I came back. This time I ordered online and the online menu was different and my order was incorrect. I know that things happen but what matters is how you deal with them. Typical greedy money grubbing Chinese takeout place threw a foreign language fit and raised hell to fix my order and at first refused until I refused payment! 

It's also expensive for greasy Chinese.

Stay away from this place. I will be eating American from now on and bashing this place to my friends at school...."}
{"text":"We went for dinner after CMU graduation on the recommendation of a Chinese colleague, and ordered off the back page of the menu - really good food.  Got two appetizers (a rabbit dish and a cucumber dish), and then four entrees (mutton with cumin, tea smoked duck, steamed tendon, and shredded pork) for our party of five - more than enough food, plenty of leftovers.
The positive: very authentic, attentive service, appreciation shown that we ordered exclusively from the back page, a variety of really pleasant and different spicings.  Moderate cost for all we got.
The negative: a moderately long wait, even with reservations (plenty of other people waiting too).  Slippery floors in the vicinity of the kitchen / bathrooms.  A somewhat awkward restaurant layout."}
{"text":"Chicken teriyaki kabobs were on the salty side, but the orange chicken was very good. Delivery came at a reasonable time, ordered at 3, came in about 30min. Delivery guy was very nice despite sending him to drop off my food in the snow."}
{"text":"the food is edible, especially when my standards were lower as a college student, but I wouldn't order from there anymore. It's your normal take-out chinese place, so you would think that it could get at least 2 stars. Let's just say they get 2 stars for food, but 0 for cleanliness, so it averages out to a 1 star rating.

I actually have an awful story about this place, but it's too disgusting to share publicly. If you want to know, I'd be happy to share privately, but I won't take any responsibility for your upchuck reflexes."}
{"text":"Food was really good! Tastes a lot like real authentic Sichuan Food. The staff was friendly and food came up quickly."}
{"text":"I personally think this is as good as it gets as far as local Chinese food delivery goes. I have never eaten in, but whatever I've ordered off their menu has left me a very happy person. 

Their lunch/dinner combos, both Americanized and Sichuan cuisines, are both good value and delicious. 

I'm a big fan of their Sichuan food items. The delivery portion is massive and the generous use of various spices makes the dish very flavorful. I would definitely recommend their mapo tofu and the sauteed beef with cumin. 

I will order from them (possibly drop by sometime in the future) for as long as I live in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"New How Lee rules. 

Since I don't eat Baby Boomer Chinese food (Sweet and Sour pork eaters, I'm talking to you) this review is totally separate from their \"not chinese\" menu. I only eat from the Szechaun menu

Is it \"phoenominal\" chinese cuisine? Hard to say. I think overall it is great; but this is coming from a Pittsburgh-centric view on Chinese food. You will have better Chinese food in China (obv) and I guess I've had better...but consistency is worth noting at New How Lee.  Try the potatoes and green chiles, and if you ask nicely you can have these dishes made with a tofu substitute, though it isn't advertised. They also get Tiger Peppers, which are extremely hot (or tolerably hot..season dependent) and spicy food eaters would relish in the chance to eat these. They are intensely enjoyable.

I saw another review representing China Star on McKnight and I'd agree it is an excellent place but it's a tough call overall-saying one is entirely better than the other isn't something I'd stake money on at this point. Though the China Star menu is formidable, I wouldn't call NHL's (just figured out that acronym...) menu weak by any means. You can get a hot pot oil styled fish platter that will throw you off; t permeates with Szechuan peppercorn and is absolutely coated in grease. However, spooning it out onto rice gives the intended result and Í'd dare a true food enthusiast not to enjoy it. There are food options/styles here that aren't seen in 90% of PGH Chinese restaurants and I think that percentage is a low estimate.

What once was a cliche Chino'merican establishment has genuinely changed...just don't look at the \"normal\" menu."}
{"text":"Just say YES to Sichuan in Squirrel Hill. I've only been here once, but our experience will bring us back.

We had something off the Amero-Chinese menu for 5yo daughter, something w/ shrimp and veggies and a light brown sauce, and she ate it all. Baby corns, yay!

Sichuan for my Lovely Date and me. We had the Tea-Smoked Duck and Chendgu Dry Fried Chicken. Latter was a bit spicy for m'Lady, but I avoided the dried, sliced peppers and enjoyed the burn. Duck was a touch crispy, but very tasty."}
{"text":"I have loved How Lee's food for all of the years I've lived in Pittsburgh. However, my last 2 take-out orders from them have fallen flat. There were bones in the sesame chicken takeout. Moo goo gai pan was salty and all of the vegetables overcooked. Don't order the brown rice, it's watery and crunchy at the same time. I don't know if they have just been slacking off on their takeout or what, but this is really disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was very pleased. My husband had a tofu soup that was very fresh and clean tasting with lots of vegetables in it followed by some sweet and sour chicken that he liked a lot. I love Sichuan food, especially Chongquin Chicken so that's what I ordered and it was very good, crisp and not at all greasy, with some big chunks of ginger and garlic. 
The portions here are huge but everything was so tasty that we finished every last bit. Service is swift, the staff are nice and the decor is light and modern, prices are very reasonable. 
Everything I saw people eating looked very good and I'd love to come back with a group and order lots of food so I could try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"A good friend of my husband's and mine said that this restaurant was the \"best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh,\" so the three of us decided to give it a try today. From driving by the outside, the restaurant doesn't look like much. The inside was a bit nicer than I had expected, and I was impressed by the service. All of our food came out very quickly, and we received water refill offers at least 5 times.

We split a Crab Rangoon appetizer, and it was absolutely delicious. I will definitely be craving those cream cheese filled dumplings some time very soon. For my entree, I ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken combination platter. It was very tasty and a very good quality. For the food we received - and the Squirrel Hill location - I thought the prices were very reasonable. I hope to return again very soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of my fav Chinese takeout joints in the 'Burgh. Don't judge, but I'm an Americanized Chinese kinda gal. This place also has an authentic Sichuan menu along with their Americanized menu. I'd really like to try some authentic food, but I'm so freaking addicted to their General Tso's chicken that when it comes time to order, I often can't resist the lure of my ol' reliable. Oh General Tso's, why can't I quit you? Crispy breaded chicken, tangy, sweet, and slightly spicy sauce, a couple of pieces of fresh broccoli thrown in for good measure...General Tso's, you please me so.

I've also had a few other standard \"Ameri-Chinese\" things from their menu (egg rolls, sweet and sour chicken, broccoli with brown sauce, lo mein, orange chicken, etc. etc.), and all are quite tasty and what you would expect from a quality Chinese takeout place. 

I don't live in Squirrel Hill anymore, but when I did, their delivery speed was always stellar. Now I do mostly takeout, and even during their busiest times, they always have my order ready when they say they will.

Bonus points: They let you sub brown rice for white for a small upcharge, which helps trick me into thinking that my meal is not going straight into my arteries (but who are we kidding, it totally is).

Someday I hope to try to some of their more authentic offerings if I can break free from the grip of General Tso."}
{"text":"Excellent food, something to suit a lot of taste buds!
Been here multiple times. Went for the classics, orange chicken and Kung Pao chicken as well as some of their signature dishes, loved them all!
Very conveniently located and great prices for the food. The portion is good and I generally end up taking some back for later"}
{"text":"This restaurant has changed management in the past month or so. Went last night and ordered off of the very extensive Szechuan menu on the back page. Wow. Never had such good Chinese food in my life. The pork belly with spicy capsicum was delicious but not too spicy as opposed to the 2-pepper signed chengdu chicken. The total winner was the chongqing dumplings. A little bowl of 7 or so delicate dumplings stuffed with a light pork filling and doused in a kicking chili-garlic sauce. Clearly, I'm not the only one who's become a fan recently because the place was packed on a Monday evening. 

Heed the pepper warnings. Order from the back page. Become an evangelist."}
{"text":"Definitely authentic Sichuan food. It's spicy, it makes your tongue numb, and it's greasy. I'm not too tolerant to greasy stuff so I didn't eat here too often, but if your body can withstand that, definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Does this place deserve 4 Yelp stars? No if you ask me. Granted I'm a native Chinese, addicted to spicy food and hold high standards for Sichuan cuisine, but with my high anticipation after reading all the 4-star reviews, this place was one big letdown.
How Lee was my first stop on my visit to Pittsburgh. I ordered the spicy fish fillets (Shui Zhu Yu), an iconic Sichuan dish, and a cucumber salad, a common cold dish hard to mess up. The cucumber salad was the weirdest version I've ever had, the dressing resembled a green paste made of chives(?). The Shui Zhu Yu was not authentic at all. The sauce was so pasty and the fish was covered in peppers - NOT the Sichuan technique of \"Shui Zhu\". I also think the server did a bad job explaining the dish to me otherwise I'd definitely have ordered something else. It was such a disappointing dining experience, especially compared to my satisfactory dinner at Everyday Noodles."}
{"text":"they should update the reviews of this place, because since changing management and rehabbing this place the food and quality is very good.  It was completely crowded, has become very popular at the moment.  The szechuan menu is delishious and ridiculously spicy.  There's also a typical chinese food menu but screw that.

I've become a regular at this place, once i went 4 times in one week... shit"}
{"text":"This place is great for authentic Chinese and not like anything else I have experienced in Pittsburgh.  I noticed many of the average reviews focused on \"Americanized\" Chinese food which is average everywhere.  They have some nonstandard offerings like tripe, pork belly and squid and The Szechuan dishes are hot, authentic and fantastic.  Be adventurous and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Take everyone's advice and order from the back page of the menu. Tons of great options there and if you are an authentic Chinese food fan you won't be let down. A lot of the items are as good as you can find in a Chinese cuisine hot bed like San Francisco. Order a bunch of items and eat family style! 

My friend wasn't so daring and tried something from the Americanized menu. It still looked really good though and the portions were huge. 

Prices are reasonable as most meals are under 10 bucks."}
{"text":"My roommate has been trying to make me go here for the longest time swearing by their food. 

I don't know what took me so long, but I believe that this is the best Szechuan restaurant in the greater Pittsburgh area. 
I went with my boyfriend to top off a rather exhausting day. We ordered spicy beef tendon, Chongqing lazi chicken, and spicy eggplant and garlic. I don't even know why we ordered that much food because in all honesty we weren't that hungry. Keeping this in mind, once our food came out we devoured all of it. It did take a few hours but we did it. Perhaps the only thing I would change would be the amount of sauce that covered the eggplants, the eggplants were practically submerged. I usually like my eggplant with a lighter amount of sauce. 
The place was a bit pricier but the portions made up for it- the chef covered the whole surface of the plate. 
The service wasn't the greatest, but they were nice enough."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh. Literally, Taiwanese Cafe, Rose Tea Cafe, OE, Lulu's, Little Asia's--none of those can even compare!

Everything is SUPER authentic. It's all fresh, delicious and just amazing. I came with a group of friends who literally loved every dish we had, and ever since I've been going by myself when I need a break from CMU's crappy campus food. 

I really recommend the honey walnut shrimp and if you can handle spicy food, the Schezuan menu on the back.

{"text":"Another week, another Squirrel Hill Chinese restaurant to try.  Seriously, there's practically one for every week of the year.  How Lee was our choice because we had an AllMenus coupon code for $10 off, so that was essentially a free entree.  Sold!  We ordered a scallion pancake, which I haven't had in years and was essentially dreaming about all this time, the Triple  Szechuan Delight (shrimp, beef, vegetables in \"brown sauce\"), and chicken fried rice because we're cool.

When we went to pick it up, the place was PACKED.  Lots of Asian families eating big pots of delicious looking food, and lots of white people standing around waiting for take out.  Sounds like this is one of those places with an American menu, and a Chinese menu.  We are pretty adventurous eaters typically, but since this was our first time at How Lee, we figured we'd start simple.  We waited about 10 more minutes after getting there, and I had to fight through the crowds to get to the front to pick up my food.  So it took about 25 minutes total for the food to be ready - kind of a while, but given the crowd I'm not surprised.

We took the food home, and nommed it.  I loved the scallion pancake - they're really simple and I've never had one that was different than any other, but the greasy, crispy consistency keeps me coming back.  Yum!  Fried rice was okay - I've had it better at other places (I think I liked it a lot at Pacific Ring).  My boyfriend really liked the Szechuan dish - it was only a little bit spicy, and the sauce did have the glossy Chinese food consistency, but the taste was pretty good.  Portions were big and lasted us for several meals.

Maybe next time we'll try something a little more adventurous, and hopefully be rewarded with deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Recently went for Chinese New Year with some friends who are in the know about ordering from the \"authentic\" Szechuan menu. Just a reminder: The \"new\" How Lee is very different from the greasy takeout establishment many will remember from years past. It's clean and bright inside, and while you can still get staples like beef and broccoli or wonton soup, you should be a bit adventurous and get something from the back of the menu. We had cold beef strips with a wonderful hot, Szechuan pepper sauce (if you haven't had these peppers they provide a numbing/tingling sensation in addition to the tradtional chile heat), cumin beef which was crisp and delicious, and a bunch of other pork/chicken dishes that I am not legit enough to remember. Bottom line, service was fast, attentive, and the food was good and spicy. Recommended for sure. Only complaint to this Westernized stomach was that the chile oil used in many dishes can be a bit heavy after awhile."}
{"text":"Came here one Friday night when the wait for Everyday Noodles was too long. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by this comforting and familiar smell of a LEGIT Chinese restaurant. I didn't think there would be any in Pittsburgh so this was a nice surprise. I don't usually like Sichuan food but this place was pretty good :) and really go for the authentic stuff. If you are just gonna order the generic stuff why even come here?"}
{"text":"The food was meh. The service was terrible. We asked for a substitution and were told it was a dollar extra. We were charged four dollars extra, then we were up charged a dollar for rice. We complained and got nowhere. On top of that the beef dish had the worst possible cuts of gummy beef I've ever had. I did enjoy the vegetable parts of our dish but the feeling of being lied to and ripped off ruined the meal."}
{"text":"Did a group order with friends. The potato scallions and chicken lo mein were decent but the diced rabbit had bones in every piece! It was the most expensive item we got and not at all worth it. I doubt we'll be eating here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Best Szechuan I've had in Pittsburgh.   Order off of the Szechuan menu, not the regular menu.   The only disappointment was the dumplings, they were obviously made with store bought wonton wrappers, the sauce they came in was great though.   Prices are high but the portions are large, definitely a place that is best to go to with several people so that you can try a little of everything.    We spent $40 for two people and took home nearly as much as we ate.

Some earlier reviews say cash only, but they now have a credit card machine."}
{"text":"Place was crowded with Chinese people when I visited on Saturday nights.   A good indicator of a good Chinese restaurant.  

Food (8.5/10) = Dishes I've tried (all from the Sichuan Specialty section of the menu):

Appetizer Section:
1) Dan Dan Noodles = A dish found on most Sichuan menus.  Classic \"street food\" fare.  A noodle dish with minced meat, with a spicy sesame paste based sauce, topped with chopped green onions +/- cilantro, and ground Sichuan peppercorns.  This dish is good, but certainly not the best I've had.  
2) Fu Qi Fei Pian = the English translation of this dish doesn't sound appetizing.  But it's certainly a Sichuan specialty, and one of the dishes I use to judge a Sichuan restaurant.  The dish is served cold and composed of thin slices of various parts of the cow (beef, tripe, tongue, etc.).  The meat is marinated with a spicy oil based sauce, topped with ground Sichuan peppercorns and chopped cilantro.  A great appetizer to try.  Again, the dish is good, but not the best 'fu qi fei pian' I've had in North America.

Vegetable Section:
1) Tu Dou Si = Essentially stir-fried julienned potato.  The dish is done well by the How Lee chefs.  Potatoes are cooked, but still slightly crisp and not soggy.
2) Yu Xiang Qie Zi = look at the picture I posted.  Look how beautiful the eggplant looks.  The glistening purple skin of this fine vegetable.  The sauce is slightly sweet and slightly spicy.  The eggplant is not overdone to the soggy mush texture that sometimes happens at some Chinese restaurants.
3) Kong Xin Cai = Chinese water spinach, or literally 'hollow heart vegetable.'  One of my favorite vegetable dishes to eat.  Lightly stir-fried with green onions and garlic.  Maybe a little ginger?  A clean crisp dish.  It's the vegetable's texture that is unique.  The crunch of biting into a vegetable straw.

Seafood Section:
1) Shui Zhu Yu Pian = This dish is done very well by the chefs of How Lee.  The fish slices are incredibly tender.  The spicy broth that these fish slices swim in is spicy...the level of spiciness where you start sweating.  The glorious physiologic reaction to Sichuan food, while your tongue is numbed out by the Sichuan peppercorns.  Again, the fish slices are big and impressively tender.  At the bottom of the shallow bowl, sits a bed of Napa cabbage.  Sprigs of cilantro sit on top of the dish.  Warning, don't drink the broth, unless you strangely enjoy extracurricular activities such as dropping fireball bombs into porcelain the next morning.

Meat Section:
1) ChongQing La Zi Ji = Chongqing style spicy diced chicken.  Little pieces of diced fried chicken.  It's crispy.  Finished in the wok with red chili peppers, garlic, and sesame seeds.  I can't decide if this is my favorite How Lee dish or the Shui Zu Yu Pian.  Despite how approx 35% of the dish is composed of red chili peppers, the spiciness is not overwhelming.  It' just enough to give each morsel of fried chicken a kick of heat.    

Ambiance (7.5/10) = Cozy and clean.  Situated at the corner of Shady Ave and Forbes.  The decor is what I expect of most Chinese restaurants.

Service (7.5/10) = service is fast.  food comes out fast.  

Overall opinion = Haven't decided if this is the best Sichuan restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Their menu includes the typical \"American\" Chinese food, but the real gem is the Sichuan menu in the back.  While some of the dishes I've tried were not the best in North America, overall the food is very delicious.  As I've mentioned in other reviews of Pittsburgh Asian restaurants, the prices are higher than what you would find in other cities with a Chinatown or a huge Asian population.  If you've never been to How Lee, I highly recommend trying the Chongqing La Zi Ji and Shui Zhu Yu Pian."}
{"text":"One of my suite mates from China said How Lee was his favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Upon his recommendation, we shared a family style dinner which included sweet & sour chicken, general tso's chicken, and two authentic Chinese dishes which were not on the American version of the menu at the time we ordered.

All of the entrees were great. My favorite was one of the authentic Chinese dishes which had tilapia served in a thick oil sauce with fresh vegetables and very spicy dried peppers."}
{"text":"Well, the worst part of the meal was the hair I found in my meal. Of course what was worse was the manager returning to our table with the hair on a napkin and telling me that it could not have come from her kitchen.  

Fwiw my hair was completely pulled back and it was darker than mine.they did offer to remake the meal but we were pretty much done -- oh and then she left the hair on the table. Yuck.

Between that and the waitress forgetting our spring rolls and insisting we never ordered it I think we are done with this place -- which is a shame since we have been eating there for about 8 years. There are plenty of other similar restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pittsburgh twice! And I came to this famous Chinese restaurant twice! Love this place! Delicious food, great attitudes and services. Reasonable price! Oh, you have to try the Thai Iced Tea!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time wirh a large group we called a couple minutes ahead and they had quickly setupes the tables for us. I got to taste multiple foods. 

The fish filet with chopped pepper and beef with chili pot were great. However, I only gave them a 4 because some of our friends felt their food ( I didn't try) was too salty.

However, definitely a good experiece and I suggest the fish filet with copped pepper dish."}
{"text":"Since I am slowly making my way through all the Squirrel Hill Chinese restaurants, my next stop was How Lee. My first complaint about this restaurant was the way that it was designed. The restaurant itself is surrounded by ground to ceiling glass windows. It doesn't make the dining experience comfortable. Another thing that bothered me was that the waitresses idly stood by the counter and stared at my friends and I the whole time we were there. As my friends and I were deciding what we were getting, three different waitresses went to our table to ask if we were ready to order which didn't make sense since they were standing right in front of us. 

The menu itself is very well organized and offers authentic Chinese food. Since How Lee specializes Sichuan style food, they had a whole separate section for that. The nice thing about the Sichuan section is that you can tell them your preference for spiciness. Since I have no tolerance, I ordered the pork belly and leeks without any spice. The pork belly was cooked perfectly although I was disappointed that it wasn't actually slices of pork belly but pork with fat running through it. The portions are huge so you definitely get your money's worth. I ended dog bagging leftovers equivalent to another meal. 

Overall, How Lee serves authentic Chinese food. I might come back to try other dishes but it didn't replace my go-to Chinese places: Rose Tea and Everyday Noodles."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Sichuanese food, come here. This is the best you are going to get outside of China.  Go with the authentic stuff on the back of the menu, that's where the good stuff is at.  Don't order the americanized crap.  This place has reinvented itself like a phoenix rising out of the ashes. 
The La zi ji (Chongqing Chili Chicken), shui zhu yu pian(Boiled Fish Slices), Hui Guo Rou (twice-cooked porkbelly), Gong bao ji (Kung Pao Chicken), and Fu qi fei pian are all very good.  
I would eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for takeout Chinese. They do Americanized Chinese food quite well, and they're always friendly and quick. I wish I could read their Chinese menu, though. The food that they prepare in restaurant off that menu (not the takeout English one) looks and smells absolutely amazing. If you know how to ask for it, do it!"}
{"text":"I'm giving a 5 stars on the food. It's pretty much on point when it comes to an authentic Sichuan style dishes. However, I prefer the Cantonese cuisine. (thanks to long time friends and in-laws)

Szechuan Menu
-The baby bak choy was sauteed to perfection with garlic oil. It wasn't over done or under cook. 
-The green beans was sauteed in garlic and pork, giving the dish a nice crunch and caramelized taste.
-The tri-pepper chicken was soo good and soo spicy. If you're not a spicy food fan, then please do not order this. The spice kicks in about 30 seconds later.  So prepare yourself! Eat this with rice to help ease the spiciness. The chicken was also sauteed to perfection. Unlike some places, it was not over done and you can still bite into juicy goodness.

American-Chinese Menu
-Fried rice was okay. Taste like any fried rice.
-Sesame Chicken was actually good! It was flavored well and juicy.

Customer Service
Maybe it's just me but it seems like the employees are usually annoyed. They weren't as attentive. I'm just not use to that in a Chinese setting. So one star down for lack of hospitality."}
{"text":"My personal favorite Chinese place in Pittsburgh. Specialized in spicy food so if you are looking into Chinese style seafood then this might not be the right place. They are very good at preserving the excellent numbness/spiciness ratio for Sichuan dishes. I once brought a friend from Hong Kong and he loved it. Now everybody in his fraternity knows about this place :P

Spicy tofu (Mapo-Doufu) is a must-get. Very soft so it can be challenging to pick up with chopsticks even for those who use them daily. But the taste... It is just perfect. And you will know what I mean if you have tried it. Lamb, fish and pork are all very good. I am not into beef but their spicy beef is also appealing to me. But before you order, make sure you are ready for the spiciness by asking for extra napkins and constant water refill.

Not a huge restaurant, but I have never had problems waiting for too long. Dishes come fast. I tried take out once, takes around 40 mins but came warm and fresh. I had it for my Chinese New Year's Eve feast. 

Try it and hope you will like it!"}
{"text":"Definitely could have been better.

I decided to order off the Sichuan menu. I got the Chengdu fried dry hot chicken. The chicken was super greasy and poor quality, and it wasn't even crispy fried, it was essentially oily chicken. They do give you a lot, especially with it being ~$13, so there was at least that. I wish I had ordered something else because I was super disappointed and barely finished my food because I didn't want to keep eating the chicken."}
{"text":"General Tso's was GREAT!! The crispy spicy chicken (Chongqing Chicken), that looks great in the pictures, was so incredibly HOT & SPICY!! I couldn't even eat more than one piece! If you LOVE spicy foods then that chicken is for you!!"}
{"text":"The food is great. This changed hands (or changed chefs) a few years ago and has been consistently excellent. I teach at Pitt and my Chinese graduate students recommended that I try it. (You know it's got to be good when the Chinese students regularly eat there.)

Seating inside is exceedingly limited, and How Lee does *very* brisk take-out.

There's a great Sichuan menu, and the Americanized menu is similarly good. Many Americanized menus use a heavy hand with sauces, sometimes to disguise the poor quality of the ingredients.

Here, the ingredients are great, you can taste the quality of the veggies and proteins, and everything is cooked really well. Sauces are used perfectly to my taste -- just enough without overpowering the dish.

I recommend sampling the whole menu. I'm not a huge fan of Sichuan pepper, but I'll make an exception for How Lee - spicy, hot, and really great."}
{"text":"A meal from the special lunch menu did not make the same impression as my last two enjoyable experiences.  We did have a courteous server who quickly brought out the orders.  However, the meat used for my Chengdu Dry Fried Chicken lunch order seemed over-processed; it was small and uniformly cut.  I never tried the dish before but this lunch preparation was not in keeping with the quality of the fare I've enjoyed, i.e., Dan Dan Noodles, (Ma La) Chicken Hot Pot, cold Liangfeng, Cumin Beef, and their authentic style General Tso's  Chicken.

Still a favorite place and a one-off, less-than-outstanding lunch won't prevent a return visit."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to them. How Lee used to be my favorite Chinese place. I ordered Tri pepper chicken as usual.... The dish was smelly, and I had to spit out half of the chicken because it was too chewy and it hurt my jaw to chew. Did they get a new chef or something? Absolute disappointment.."}
{"text":"Waitress attitude is terrible, when we refuse to tip, they even try to obstruct us from leaving..."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite dinner spots whenever I visit Pittsburgh with a group of friends. They offer authentic Szechuan food and the prices are pretty reasonable.
 
We came in on a Saturday night and made a reservation ahead of time for 14 people. It took some logistics by the staff to fit together a bunch of tables, but they found a way. There had been a long wait so we actually put in our order ahead of time - 14 dishes. One dish per person sounded reasonable. This included cold/hot appetizers, soup, and entrees. When we were seated, service was prompt and the dishes came out one by one. The food was flavorful and had just the right about of spice if you enjoy Szechuan food. Since we placed the order ahead of time when waiting, it actually only took us an hour to finish our meals.
 
When the bill came, we were offered an opportunity to pay with cash for 10% off our bill. Tremendous. After gratuity and the cash discount, it came to $14 a person. That's $1 per dish, per person. What a deal!
 
We were able to try a wide variety  of dishes which added to the great experience."}
{"text":"HOW LEE CRAP WHAT TERRIBLE SERVICE

They took two hours to deliver my food and I missed my event because of them. They did not bother telling us they were gonna be delayed"}
{"text":"We went back for a dinner last week and order the most popular dish that Yelper suggested. It is about 18 per dish and just an ok. We perfer another Chinese nearby."}
{"text":"I tried How lee after deciding not to wait an hour to eat at Chengdu Gourmet (which I love!). First impression left me feeling a little nervous about the food. The place looks to have been recently renovated, but nothing fancy. After being sat and ordered off of the extensive menu, the server gave us some small plates and wine glasses. A few of the wine glasses had a \"film\" on them that I cannot pinpoint the source of. And then a few of the plates still had a little \"crust\" stuck to them. The server was happy to exchange these items out for cleaner ones. Not a good start, but the order had already been placed so I was going to give this place a shot whether I wanted to or not.

DRINKS
- BYOB

APPETIZERS
- Steamed pork dumplings. These were so-so.

MAINS
- Tiger Skin Peppers. Wow - these are delicious, but incredibly spicy! Being someone who loves spice, I was even a little nervous to dive into this dish after tasting the first bite. Others at the table literally had tears dripping down their faces. Folks, any pepper can range in spice level -- order with caution.
- Spicy eggplant. I'm not even an eggplant fan, and this dish was really good.
- Mapo tofu (ordered with no pork) -- aka the Szechuan tofu. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.
- Others at my table ordered the spicy prawns, chili beef, and some spicy chicken dish. They all enjoyed these dishes, but probably the chicken and beef ones more than the prawns.

OVERALL
I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I wish they would double-check their plates and glassware before setting it out, but as far as the food is concerned, it was a good experience.

I will definitely give How Lee a shot again in the future."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately on the late side on a Sunday for dinner though the place was packed and ordered the following, all off the Sichuan menu:
dan dan noodles
shredded potatoes and green chili peppers (these look like nothing when they arrive but they taste like salty french fries but w/o the crunch!)
shredded pork with garlic sauce

Good food/service so no complaints here.

Leftovers tasted just as good the next day, and it appeared people like to do take out too."}
{"text":"I've ordered from them like... 5 times. 
Almost always it takes about 50 min. I don't have any complain about that since I've heard that this place is quite popular place for eating out. 

How I rate Chinese restaurant... 
Believe it or not, I breakout in half an hour after I consume fat/oil, especially saturated ones... 
And after eating How Lee's breakouts are not as bad as after eating other Chinese..."}
{"text":"Maybe I keep ordering all the wrong items here, but everything from the hot and sour soup to the fried rice to the entrees have been really inferior to all the Chinese places I've had across the country. 

The cheng-du chicken was had a weird after-taste, the hot and sour soup needs more sour, the fried rice was bland, and the salt and pepper squid was underseasoned. I think overall, the flavors here are all underwhelming. 

I very much prefer Sichuan Gourmet on Murrey."}
{"text":"Didn't think it was possible... But this place makes me NEVER want to eat General Tsos chicken again in life. Definitely do not recommend. One of the worst Chinese places I've eaten at by far."}
{"text":"What a delicious treat! Solid 4 overall. 

Came with a party of 2 and shared the dan dan noodles as an appetizer. I could smell the aroma of the Szechuan peppercorn...mmmm.. and each bite leaves your mouth with just a hint of numbness. Not to fear - it's not too strong. Noodles also had a nice chewy texture. It's a medium sized bowl, but we ate only about half to save room for the entrees.

Had the sautéed chinese watercress - so yum as it was cooked just right to retain it's crispness. Watercress itself has a great natural taste to it already, and it was complemented with some flavorful garlic pieces and slight gingery taste.

Also had the chongqing dry hot chicken. I asked them to make it a little less spicy, so I'm not sure how spicy it originally is.. It was nice and crispy, covered with red chilis and sesame seeds. Yum! You can also get the chengdu version, which is unbreaded, so I wanna try that next time.

Thoroughly impressed ^_^ will come back, especially for those noodles."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place and it was really good! We got eggrolls which were good. Then we shared the beef chow fun and general tso's chicken. The chow fun came with like angel hair noodles and the general tso's chicken sauce was good, but some of the chicken was a bit dry. Other than that the staff was really nice and I'll be back."}
{"text":"So far I've only had take-out and my experience had its ups and downs.  On the positive side, they serve one of the best General Tso's Chickens I've ever tasted.  The sauce is perfect and thankfully lacks the strange gelatin quality of too many other places.  The chunks of dark meat chicken were huge (almost too big for my mouth) and the heat level was perfect for my liking.  The portion was large and allowed for some great late night munching.  However, on the negative side, my girlfriend found her tofu dish almost inedible and remarked that the tofu was cooked to a very unpleasant consistency.  Also, the spring rolls were mushy and below average.  

In the future, I'd like to try the Szechuan menu although it would be difficult to persuade the lady friend to come here again.  I may have to come alone and eat only the amazing General Tso's.  Seriously, it's epic.  Even my girlfriend who is a vegetarian said that it looked and smelled amazing.  If the other dishes would have been on par, this would be a regular spot but unfortunately, they were not.  So for now, How Lee remains an average Chinese option with an above average location (Shady and Forbes in Squirell Hill) that just so happens to make an amazing General Tso's."}
{"text":"Good stuff--I had a good meal from there two or so years ago and went back again, had cumin mutton and a spicy eggplant dish. Both were tasty. The mutton dish stood out a little more. The prices are reasonable for what you get. I would go here more often if I lived in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Bad vibe....the manager is extremely rude and inconsiderate. There were also long wait times."}
{"text":"If you want some AUTHENTIC Chinese food, this is where to get it! How Lee was the epitome of a bland American Chinese food takeout place before they renovated the restaurant. After they renovated their entire place and the menu items, there is the closet place for authentic Chinese food in the Pittsburgh area! Some of my favorites are their spicy fish filet in hot broth and the spicy fried chicken (La Zi Ji). Very popular Sichuan dishes. Their food can be quite spicy, so don't forget to ask for less peppers. 

Never mind what I say, just look at how there's always a line out around dinner time on weekends! And it's always packed with Chinese people. You know it's legit when the place is packed with a lot of Chinese people :D"}
{"text":"I eat here every chance I get!  If you like spicy asian food, than this is the last restaurant you'll ever need.  I practically drink chiracha sauce, I love all things spicy and How Lee's new chef (imported directly from China's sichuan province) sends out all the spicy dishes with a beautiful sea of flavorful chili peppers.  There are plenty of non-spicy dishes which are good, but not amazing.  But if you like spicy authentic Szechuan cuisine, this is Pittsburgh's finest!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but very bad attitude from both the servers and the delivery guy. Last time I ordered there, I paid 20% tips to the delivery guy up front, only got yelled at over the phone because 1. he had trouble finding my place and 2. I was 30 seconds late to the door. I put the the direction clearly in the note, and anticipating the difficulty tipped the delivery, and this is what I got. Very upset; will not return."}
{"text":"This place has decent Chinese food, a little better than average for the standard offerings.  What I like most about this place is that they offer non-standard fare for those who are a little more adventurous, and who want something more authentic.  For instance, I ordered the braised beef tendon and braised fish fillets, both of which were pretty decent.  I also got the salt and pepper squid.  The squid differed a bit in that the pepper actually makes your tongue a bit numb.  This is apparently from the particular Chinese peppercorns that they use - an interesting, and unexpected aspect to it.  I also like it because you can order right off of Yelp - I've done this twice with them, and both times the food was prepared very quickly, and the transaction went without a hitch.  One minor complaint is that there was a bit more \"filler\" in each of my dishes (bean spouts, leeks, lettuce, etc), where as I would have wanted more of the main dish.  I would give this place 3.5 stars, but not 4."}
{"text":"I ordered the pepper steak combination platter, which includes fried rice and a spring roll. I also added on an egg roll and a 20 oz Dr Pepper. This was for delivery. 

What I received was a warm bottle of Coke, somewhat warm meal, and two egg rolls. No soy sauce in the bag, just the duck sauce I had specifically mentioned while ordering. I also didn't get a fork or napkins like most places give with delivery. 

Ugh this just wasn't a good experience at all!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a while. I always order the Chongqing Chicken. Tonight I enjoyed it the most I ever have. (I am wondering  if they changed the kitchen staff, as the dish has gone from really good to great). Last time, there wasn't any salt on the chicken, this time it was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  
My husband had the beef and green beans and the meat was very tender.  We both enjoyed our meal as usual, but tonight it was over the top."}
{"text":"Love this place. All of the food is great with the exception of the hot and sour soup which is just ok. Will return!"}
