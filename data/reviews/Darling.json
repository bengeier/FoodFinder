{"text":"The wife and I stumbled into this place by pure accident. But like, a great accident. Like when you aren't looking and you bump into who ends up being the love of your life in one of those cheesy RomComs? That was like this. We just bumped into this place around 1pm on a Wednesday when trying to find a coffee shop. It looked like a bar, but they clearly had an espresso machine in front. We walked in and were wowed by the amazing decor. Weird art work on the walls, the center bar looks like a trippy carnival ride, and the rest looks like a hodgepodge of odd antique store finds. 

We sat at the bar and just ordered lattes, which were great. The wife had one with almond milk which was nice for them to have. It really just looked like a bunch of folks were studying and working there. Lots of laptops out, books, etc. Our bartender told us if we came back at night, it'd be 100% different. So..... we did. 

Came back around 8pm and MAN! 100% different. Super crowded, the same people who were studying earlier were now knocking back drinks. So this time we had drinks. They had some good ciders on draft, and some amazing beers. Pretty reasonable prices! Especially as the all mighty American dollar goes a bit further up north. Our bartender (Ella? Estella?) was super adorable and very friendly. We actually had her both times, and I felt bad she was working a super long shift, but was very nice and friendly the entire time. 

I really wish there was a spot like this up in Portland because I would be there every every every day. 

Great date spot (wife and I both agreed we wish we could import this place), great study spot in the day. A+!"}
{"text":"Very nice place located St.Laurent Boulevard. The décor is amazing with a lot of plants and vintage accessories.I went there after work on a Friday with a group of friends. The place was crowded but we were able to sit comfortably at one of the tables. Their beer and cocktail selection is impressive. I had the \"White & Stormy\" cocktail which was delicious. My friends had beer and they all loved the waitress recommendation. 

Highly recommend especially if you're a small group of people."}
{"text":"Cute place. Good mix of people. We only stopped for a drink. Their cider sangria is delicious. Will need to come back to try their menu."}
{"text":"Hands down my fav bar/cafe in Montreal. There's tons of seating and a patio in the summer. 

The crowd here is super chill and the staff are a friendly gang of locals. They have a great selection of beers on tap and a lot of local beers. During the today they open up the huge window/walls and turn the space into a cafe. The wifi is solid and the food/drinks are great. Definitely check this place out if you are looking for a nice place to hang out with friends, work or chill. 

The interior is also super cool. They have massive lettering on one part of the ceiling and plants/kitschy decor."}
{"text":"Great spot for any occasion!!! 
I go here way too often whether it be in the day time for a coffee date, for drinks at night with a big group of friends or a casual date night.
Big space with great ambience, friendly staff, cheap beers and very reasonably priced cocktails. The music is good but not too loud so you have conversations with no problem! 
Food is a bit pricey but it's actually pretty good so no complaints about this place!!"}
{"text":"One of the most beautiful restaurant-bar-café hybrids I've ever been to in my time in Montreal. 

Though we visited later in the earlier (around 6:00 pm), it was already transformed into a loud and bustling area with lots of conversation going on around us. We sat in the couch area next to the window, which had great natural lighting even though it had been raining all day. The decorations are breathtaking - lots of brass, wood, and plants creates a perfect instagram worthy setting. It was a little stuffy inside, but I think that was mostly due to the number of people. The only con I can name is the faint smell of cigarette smoke that lingered in our area.

The service was fast and friendly, and we were even given free extra bread for our foie gras! The coffee was nice, and prices were good. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Un très beau bar avec un bon service. L'ambiance est sympathique avec un bon menu de bières et cocktails. La décoration du bar  et ses diverses lumières tamisées en vaut le détour. Mon amie qui ne connaissait pas cet endroit a été agréablement surprise. Même si la place est réputée pour ses nombreux cocktails, c'est un endroit parfait pour prendre une bière avec ses amis ou lors d'une date."}
{"text":"Fan déjà du Majestic et du Suzanne, j'adore l'esprit et la philosophie de l'équipe.
L'ambiance et le cadre est à mon sens très montréalais et très réussi bien que un peu dispendieux.
Lors de mon passage la cuisine était plus que légère et le tout était relativement dispendieux.
L'ajout de véritables plats serait un must et permettrait d'y passer là soirée sans changer de lieux... à condition de rester abordable et ne pas en faire un autre de ces lieux 'hype' et hors de prix.
Le tout reste à confirmer !"}
{"text":"Darling is a cute café-bar not so far from the Mont-Royal metro station. I went there on a Thursday morning for a quick coffee and ended up staying one hour. There was a little bit of jazzy background music not too loud, not too soft, just perfect for a relaxing coffee time. As they have wifi, there were a few people working and the bar section was closed.

The service was perfect, I ordered a Moccachino, a latte, a lime tart, a chocolate croissant and a brownie. Everything tasted very good especially their lime tart, I'm a fan! 

I will have to update my review very soon because I definitely want to try the bar section!"}
{"text":"Really cute bar in Montreal but the decor is all it offers! The place is filled with plants and lights, little round tables, a couple book shelves, and other funky finishing touches. 

The service was good at the beginning, then essentially nonexistent. We never saw our server after our drinks & snacks came out. We were able to get the attention of other ones when we needed something.

They do not yet have food - just a few appetizers. We tried the artichoke dip which came with a toasted bread and raw veggies. It was OK.

Their sangria was super sweet and had basically no alcohol in it. We had been hesitant to order it and our server assured us that it wasn't very sweet. Maybe it was a bad night for the bartenders or we all have very different ideas of what very sweet means. 

Regardless, I did have a nice time here. I sat down with a friend around 730pm on a Saturday. It wasn't a bad place to go to catch with a friend or for a date. I wouldn't recommend going here in a group unless you go quite early (which is difficult bc they don't serve dinner). By the time we left at 930pm, the line to get in was down the street. 

I think if I were to go back here it would be just for coffee in the afternoon as the bar doubles as a cafe with wifi."}
{"text":"This place may seem sketchy from the outside, but its absolutely beautiful inside! I loved everything about it. The vibe, the decor, the service. It's definately a good place to come with friends, and gives you a reason to dress up. Don't really recommend it as a date night as the tables are pretty close together and you loose a bit of privacy. 

They have a lot of drink specials, I recommend the ciders, all of them were my favourite. The beers were really good too. I wish they had a food menu, apparently they only have appitizers during the night."}
{"text":"A friend and I had just descended Mont Royal and wondered into this place, the only place buzzing with people on a Saturday afternoon, after a long search for a place with good vibes to have a drink and some food. The downside is that they only have snacks - but the spiced almonds we had were DELICIOUS and well-priced for the quantity. They held our hunger at bay for sure. 

The selling point of this place is the decor and atmosphere. Whoever designed Darling deserves to win an award. It is really well and thoughtfully put together, down to the last detail. With the music, and the crowd, and the friendly bartender, it was just magical. I couldn't stop raving about the design and decoration - from the open kitchen to the light fixtures to the restrooms - this place in NYC would surely be a hot spot. I only wish they served meals - even bar food like burgers and fries would be great! But the ?expresso stout beer we had was so delicious we stayed for another round. Cheers to this unique place!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. Beautiful atmosphere. Reasonably priced drinks. Great service. I would HIGHLY recommend.

I tried the Cr d'Artichant which was delicious!"}
{"text":"What a darling spot! I went with three of my girlfriends, and I told the host we are four, and he says no, you are 4 beautiful girls. Compliments will take you to places. It is an adorable place. The service was friendly and helpful. I had a glass of white wine, which was perfect , with bruschetta. Omg, the taste of the bruschetta was delicious. Every bite of the bread, the spicy basil, the garlic, the tomato, the sun dried tomato, the olive oil and the garlic, on my tongue harmoniously. Perfect hangout place."}
{"text":"This bar has a really cool and chill vibe. They have a very extensive drink menu with many beer options, cider and cocktails. The IPA cocktail was incredible. Highly recommend. The decor and ambiance was half of the experience. The space is beautiful. With all of the bars on st Laurent, this one's a must."}
{"text":"Darling is such a cute café/bar with such great decor. My friend and I have been eyeing this place for quite a while and were really excited to try this place. They have a great selection for everything except for cocktails and I love me some pina colada so I was a bit disappointed that they didn't offer a big variety of \"girly\" cocktails. They do have a huge, huge selection of beers, ciders and wine; so if you're a fan of any of those, you'll be thrilled. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case for me but I do recognize that it's still a fine establishment."}
{"text":"What a darling place! A bunch of us decided to check this place out and we were not disappointed. It is a feast for the eyes! The decor, lights and vines were all on point. We went a bit photo crazy as everything around us was so beautiful. I had a latte and banana bread, while my friends tried other little items off the menu. All of us were satisfied. Excellent service as well. Everyone was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Love that place ! The ambiance is really nice in the morning to study, in the afternoon for a coffee break or, my favorite time, at night for a drink.
It's a really hot place to have a beer, cider or cocktails. They have a large choice and give good advice. 
My fav is the dry cider 

Nice place to bring your date
TRY IT"}
{"text":"From the outside it looks like a dark, small bar but when you go inside, the place opens up, is beautifully lit and decorated. It has a very nice ambiance. We went there at 8 pm on a Thursday night and the entire place was packed. 

We were there for birthday drinks for a friend. The service is efficient and friendly. Accommodated the large party and were very attentive. We had a great time and will definitely be coming by again!!"}
{"text":"Super deco originale de très bon goût. Vaste choix de boissons cependant je trouve que la carte de la bouffe n'est pas assez étoffée et les prix des bières un peu cher."}
{"text":"What an incredible neighbourhood bar   Busy yet friendly. Drinks a little small but the ambiance is fabulous."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars of all time.  Cool circular bar and great beer list at a reasonable price for the area at about $6-7 per draft.  It's a very cool place that has coffee in the morning and cocktails at night.  The decorations are very fun and carousel-like as well with the entire venue protruding the stylish coverings.  The only complaint I had was that I didn't tip and the waiter came running out of the bar afterwards and started getting in our face to \"discuss\" the tip.  We didn't have cash and the credit card machine wasn't allowing us to leave a tip - not our fault.  Other than the really out of nowhere encounter with the bartender that I've never experienced before, Darling was certainly fantastic and worth a nightcap."}
{"text":"Nice cafe/bar convert with a tiny food menu so don't come here if you're hungry. 
It's also a little loud however, it is a perfect place tucked in the plateau for if you want a place to work/study or grab a drink.
The staff are welcoming and the vibes are cute."}
{"text":"La déco est vraiment belle et la serveuse a été vraiment sympa avec nous.

J'y suis aller en afterwork avec une amie pour boire un chai que j'ai bien aimé et nous avons également pris le cheesecake qui était vraiment bon.

Le seul point négatif que je dirais c'est que c'est extrêmement bruyant tant au niveau des gens du monde qu'au niveau de la musique vraiment trop forte à mon goût pour un endroit comme celui-ci.

Je recommande tout de même :-)"}
{"text":"So darling is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars for me. I've been there a few times for a light dinner and drinks, for coffee and for late night drinks... The food items are too limited to tempt me for dinner again. But the coffee is good and they have a nice cider collection that i enjoy and appreciate

 What brings me back is the edgy decoration and the cozy ambient and the fact that it doesn't break  the bank to stop by there. It just has this comfy easy going feeling to it. I do wish that it was a little more quiet/less crammed at nights so that i could maintain a conversation with less effort."}
{"text":"Went out for coffee with a group of girls. A really nice ambiance with a mix of decor (some creepy dolls). Love the different light fixtures used in the resto/bar. Then bar is gorgeous. We were welcomed very nicely and given the option to sit either on chair or leather couch, we chose the couch seating area. The menu was only available in French which was a little disappointing. They have a full list of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. However very little food options. I ordered a virgin mojito which was great and a latte with almond milk. The latte was very strong but excellent. On of the girls ordered a regular latte which was lighter and just as good. They have cakes options, the banana bread was good but nothing exceptional. The appetizers (food option) is only available after 5. My other friend and I had the bruschetta which is probably the best I've ever had. It was served on 3 pieces of bread but it was well worth it. There was only a couple more options like a cheese platter and I don't remember the others. This beautiful bar/cafe decorated with books, plants, dolls, etc is definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"The best thing about Darling is the ambience and aesthetic decorations. If you come here you will feel like you're in a 80's movie with a trendy millennial vibe. They have so many plants and little quirky items that fill up the place.

The drinks are excellent too. We had white and stormy, which is their special, White Russian, Bloody Mary and the sangria pitcher. White and stormy is probably not a universally popular drink because it's heavily gingery but I enjoyed it. They did a great job on the other cocktails too so I would say it's a good place to try new drinks!

We also had the edamame platter, which is a dip plate that comes with edamame sesame dip. It was something new and delicious!

The downside, however, is the price. It's definitely on the upscale and you will be spending more than you planned to."}
{"text":"It was a Friday night out in Montreal with some homies visiting from the States (first time in Montreal) and I was visiting from Toronto. It was our first real night out, just wanting to get that real ethnic Montreal night life experience. Not knowing where to start we randomly choose this Bar and all I have to say is what a way to start the first the night off! Very Nice bartenders, great drinks and great vibes in this place. All I gotta say is Darling you had me at Hello, props to them."}
{"text":"Step inside and you are suddenly transported to a lush quirky New Orleans bar. Absolutely loved the decor, lights and quantities of plants they have in every corner of the space. I kept looking around and noticing little details and funny items tucked into the inconspicuous corners. It's a large space so there are plenty of tables, each with a unique view of the environment. 

They have my friend's favorite IPA on tap so we had to stop for a drink! We did cave and got an order of fries to share and they were gobbled up in no-time. Would love to come back for dinner and try out their menu!"}
{"text":"Very very cute bar/cafe. Cozy and the coffee drinks we had were delicious for a reasonable price. The staff was lovely as well."}
{"text":"A good spot for drinks on the Main. It can be busy, and a bit loud but it's bright and airy, with a lot of plants. It has a good selection for drinks, but food is just for snacking and nothing too noteworthy."}
{"text":"New place in town! At night it's a great for a drink with friends and the decor is super nice  the price for a beer is super good and it's a super cozy place. There's a lineup to get in more often than not so be patient !"}
{"text":"Bon je pense que l'endroit a ouvert il y a peu de temps mémé si la décoration laisse le doute. En effet quand on passe devant on est tout de suite attiré par le coté cosy de l'endroit avec plein de petite lumières mais quand on regarde de plus prêt on dirait que tout vient de récupération. Ce n'est pas négatif du tout car je trouve que cela apporte du charme à l' endroit. Ca fait vieil entrepôt industriel. J'ai adoré l'éclairage fait a base de récupération de façade de théâtre ou cinéma... si je peux je piquerai l'idée pour chez moi.
En plus de cela le bar est en cercle et se trouve presque au milieu ce qui est très pratique.
Pour ce qui est des boissons le choix est \" limité \" en terme de cocktails mais à mon avis il est possible de faire une demande spéciale car ils ont vraiment de tout. Pour ce qui est des bières le choix est par contre un peu juste mais bon ce n'est pas non plus une microbrasserie...
Au final je pense que c'est un endroit sympa pour ce poser entre amis et discuter car la musique ne vous explose pas les oreilles et que l'ambiance cosy est la pour ca. Surement pas mal pour une date aussi."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in Montreal. It's directly across the street from Leonard Cohen's old house, which is located on 28 Rue de Vallières. If you're a Cohen fan, google this address which should lead you to multiple articles on all the businesses he used to frequent on this part of St Laurent. 

There's usually a short wait when we arrive. I go there about once or twice a week and there's never been  time when it hasn't been crowded. The drinks themselves are spectacular. I prefer cocktails and they make a nice old-fashioned (which is my favorite drink). But they mostly specialize in beer (lots of nice local choices) and wine, and are one of the few places in Montreal to feature a nice range of cider. The food menu is small but delicious. I have tried almost everything on the menu at this point and have been pleasantly surprised at how good some of the dishes have been, especially the mussels and the beef tartare. The portions are very tiny, though, but the prices are super reasonable. The decor is also really special. There are bookshelves and books everywhere, which I feel adds a nice touch. The place is usually lit with a sort of amber colored lighting which makes it a perfect place for a date. My only complaint would be the fact that it is so crowded at times that you might find yourself yelling across the table at the person you came with."}
{"text":"Cafe by day and bar by night, Darling is a beautiful gem on St. Laurent. The interior design is beautifully vintage and very well put together. 10/10 for relaxing and studying. Will definitely come back! :)"}
{"text":"I tried to go índice 2x different  times and truly got turned away because it was either closed to closing time or because the bar was closed...
Honestly, it was a profile age thing,I'm mid 50's and the crowd was young, mid 20's and early 30's, just rude. A 0 will be my rating."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why folks rave about this place. Service was slow, cocktail and food menu extremely sparse, and the little food they did service wasn't prepared all that well. Stick with the fries and grab a beer. That's the extent of Darling. Ambiance is good, felt like a neighborhood bar where you could catch up with friends any day of the week."}
{"text":"I really love Darling, from the adorable plant-focused decor to the soothing low lighting. It's got a great selection of drinks, though I haven't tried the food yet - I come here at lunch time to work on my laptop, which means it's around the time of day that many tables are taken up by people doing the same. 

It's a really good place to work, and there are sockets everywhere - even at the bar!"}
{"text":"J'aurais volontiers donner 4 étoiles. Ce type d'endroit est totalement mon genre: café le jour ou l'on peut bouquiner, avoir des rendez-vous d'affaires et ou on a même disposé des étagères ici et là afin de pouvoir prendre un livre. Le soir l'ambiance change, les lumières se tamisent, la musique monte de volume et le café laisse place à un bar branché. La décoration est sublime, des plantes ici et là, mais qui font aussi effet solarium : il faisait une chaleur insoutenable!! Bref, vous serez ravi de l'endroit au niveau du décor et de l'ambiance, malgré que cela soit bruyant en soirée, j'ai personnellement trouvé que ce n'était pas si désagréable. Toutefois, contrairement à la majorité des commentaires, mon service à table a été ridicule. La serveuse que nous avions était totalement désintéressée de nous. A aucun moment, elle n'est venu nous demander si tout allait bien. La seule chose qu'elle faisait c'est prendre le verre vide et demander : une autre? Sérieux ?!? Nous avions tellement chauds que nous avons demandé un verre d'eau. Après 15 minutes, nous le lui rappelons, et bien la fille semblait nous avoir complètement oublié. Elle arrive avec deux verres d'eau tiède, sans demander si nous souhaitions quoi que ce soit d'autre. J'avais une faim de loup et je me serais laissée tenter par un plateau de charcuterie, c'était quand même un bon 21$. Si la serveuse m'avait accordé un minimum d'intérêt, oui j'aurais passé commande, mais là quel intérêt? Je vais aller dépenser mon argent ailleurs.... Bref, j'espère que cet employé réalisera qu'on ne juge pas un établissement que par les petites plantes, par les jeux de lumières et par l'ambiance, si le service est nul il y a tellement d'autres options dans le quartier, d'ou le fait que j'ai fini ma soirée dans un autre bar!"}
{"text":"Love the vintage style design and the awesome selection of local beers. Great service. Too bad they don't have an English menu and it's VERY hot in the inside sitting area but if you get a window/outside table it's such a gorgeous place to spend your evening."}
{"text":"This space is beautiful with greenery, lights, and big windows, and whimsical decor. 

We sat at the bar and my boyfriend ordered a beer and I ordered a black coffee. The bartender recommended a local beer (unfortunately, we don't remember the name), but it was SO good. It was a white ale with a hint of banana - but that's all I remember.

They brought me an espresso, which was good, but not what I ordered. I probably should have said something, but didn't want to be high maintenance. 

Overall - great experience!"}
{"text":"Hello, my Darling. This place is perfect. Literally perfect. And not the way that you might say literally when you're actually embellishing. It is LITERALLY, at least for me, perfect. 

It's big, quiet, charming, fun, different, welcoming... its everything that a bar/café/hangout should be. 

You can do work here, you can catch up on life, you can get together with 15 of your closest friends, and I'm sure there are countless other activities that could take place here, but I can't be bothered to think of them. 

Come here. Have a drink. Have a coffee. Do whatever. You'll be happy that you did."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Beautiful inside. Amazing looking bar. A must visit for food, drink and ambiance."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow this is such a great place to grab a coffee as well as a lovely bar to get a drink! Going inside Darling feels like stepping into a wonderland, the vibes are so lovely and I am so amazed by the decor. I love the different sections inside, adorned with different decorations that are chique, beautiful, extravagant and eye catching. Even though the place is big, i feel that the noise level is quite okay in the afternoon. I find the service average and their tea okay, but I would say that I would come back again and again just because of this stunning beauty. I think that they offer a great variety of wine and beer and so on, I would come back again to experience the bar side of Darling n"}
{"text":"Cool place, really fun to meet up with friends. Their service is friendly and polite and always ready to answer any questions or provide suggestions. It does have a big hipster crowd, but on the bright side their cocktails are strong and delish that you'll enjoy your night regardless. Their decor is a big plus, original and fun. Definitely a cool place to bring your date for a drink before or after dinner."}
{"text":"Very cute cafe/ bar located on Saint-Laurent. Darling is a great place to go for coffee in the afternoon and an even better place to go for a drink at night. The decor and ambiance are definitely the best things this establishment has to offer - 10/10. 

One thing I noticed is that it gets crowded pretty quickly at night. Moreover, it's extremely loud, making it hard to hear the people you're with. I was a little bit disappointed because they seemed to have run out of the two types of wine that I was interested in trying, however, I still enjoyed the wine I had to settle for. With that said, the alcohol selection on the menu was decent. The service was a bit slow, but my server was extremely nice and made good recommendations. It was also fairly busy, so I completely understand. Prices are what one would expect at a place like this. 

This isn't my favourite bar in Montréal, but I will definitely be returning because of the decor and ambiance."}
{"text":"The decoration and the opening hours is what makes this place unique. We took cappucinos and a chat latte. The cappucino is very good and strong but the coffees were not super hot as we asked. Unfortunately there is no food, only finger food. Very good ambiance."}
{"text":"Very chilled, hip and beautiful. Think green plants, dark wood, soft leather, and brass elements. Hushed classical music rounds it all off. Darling invites you to feel comfortable, bring your book or laptop, sip a coffee, or maybe even a daytime whiskey. The atmosphere somewhat provokes it. The large front windows look onto Parc du Portugal. The leafy trees make up for the disrupting passing cars on busy Boulevard Saint-Laurent.
By the entrance you will find a glass case with a small selection of sweet and savory pastries. If they offered freshly prepared food as well, Darling would probably be a five star establishment to me."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite spots in Montreal. By day, it's an eclectic cafe with an abundance of natural light from their huge windows. By night, it's a cozy and packed bar with an awesome beer list, tons of wine and cocktail options. The decor is quirky, fun and unique. Cozy booths or couches plus tons of tables and bar space. Definitely great for groups or solo. 

Also the service has always been good. Even when they asked me to move to the other side of the bar to accommodate people waiting, they gave me a little cocktail as a gesture of thanks. Don't mind if I do. 

Seriously though. The beer list is great and the ambience can't be beat. Must stop in Montreal! 


 And wifi!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance assurée et ideal pour venir entre amis qui parlent fort ! C'est tres bruyant et la musique est etouffée .. comique; lumieres tamisées et bcp de choses à regarder dans la deco, comme les plantes un peu partout, j'aime bien."}
{"text":"interesting looking place with great bar and decent cocktail selection 

had some snacks of a limited menu which we enjoyed 

lots to look at
felt like a place i would be comfortable at of i went by myself"}
{"text":"I've been to this fantastic place several times and was there again last night! As usual, the place is vibrant and the decor is very unique which makes it even more enjoyable.

I tend to usually go for drinks but would like to try to go for coffee or even a meal at some point. Their drink menu is quite extensive and if you like cider then you know where to go ;-)  try their ciders and pear cider as well which is on the sweet side but great. 

Magalie our host was very patient and tried to accommodate our groups needs :-)

Will definitely keep going back!!!"}
