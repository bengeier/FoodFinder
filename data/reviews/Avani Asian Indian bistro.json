{"text":"Ordered takeout and was very disappointed.    The chicken in the butter chicken was dry and the basmati rice was over salted. I've had better butter chicken from the food court at square one. The samosa rolls are not worth the price. They are not very good at all. The only thing that was decent was the chow mein. Will not be going back here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely adored my visit to Avani! This was a location I've always wanted to try and finally got the chance to recently. The decor was beautiful and the interior looked authentic, but modern and warm. 

It was a party of three. The following were ordered (unfortunately I can't remember the exact names): roti, lamb, deep fried shrimp, curry chicken, saffron rice, and basmati rice. As a birthday present, our server brought out a ball of mango ice cream deep fried in a coconut batter and drizzled with sweet syrup. 

The food was cooked to perfection. It was hot, the meat was tender, the rice was soft and fluffy, the roti was warm and broke easily, and the flavors of the ice cream worked well together. 

Loved every minute of this visit. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Pricey but really good! Loved the chilli paneer (dry)!"}
{"text":"Staff unfriendly. Did not greet us or smile.
Waited over 10 minutes to be offered a drink.
Currently still at the restaurant, will update if the service gets any better..."}
{"text":"Awesome indian food. the butter chicken is cooked to perfection and the goat curry is to die for if you can take the spices. the Naan is totally fresh and sublime. totally worth the price. absolutely try the chicken sampler appetizer."}
{"text":"The service is very slow and wait staff doesn't pay attention to patrons especially who do not order expensive alcoholic drinks. The food was greasy and took forever to arrive. Quite expensive however to be expected as the place is classy with nice decor however the food is not great."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic cuisine for those who like it spicy! Portions are perfectly sized. I would've given it a perfect score; but they need a host desk; waiting for seating takes patience."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Indian cuisine! They have a variety of dishes and they are all very good! I've been here a few times and the food has been excellent every time. I especially recommend the lamb and chicken curries. The food well cooked and the portions are appropriately sized, however, it can be a little pricey. Compared to other Indian restaurants in the area,  this feels like a fancier restaurant. 

They have a full bar, and the service is excellent. The atmosphere is comfortable, and the decor incorporates many details that reflect Indian culture. 

Overall, it is an excellent place to try Indian food, the food is delicious every time, the only downside is the price."}
{"text":"just ordered takeout - Mix veggie curry,it was ok"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times.

First with a small group, second time for take out and recently with a group of 25.

The bill was horrendous but the food was good.

Service could be better though. Many of us were left forgotten without any water refills or drink refills."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I never used to be a big fan of Indian food. All that changed after my Avani experience. The restaurant is really nice, bright and spacious with high ceilings and Indian-inspired decor. Right away the ma√Ætre d' gave us a warm welcome and showed us to our table. We started with the chicken kebab sampler which was a great way to kick start the meal. Lots of choices on the menu, and we were particularly impressed with the tandoori mixed grill, sizzling eggplant, aloo gobi and dal makhani. Most dishes are served in classical Indian copper pots with a tea light underneath to keep things nice and warm.  Our servers were excellent and offered lots of helpful suggestions for ordering, and they made sure we were always attended to while also giving us our space to enjoy the meal and the ambiance. Most importantly, afterwards there were no feelings of indigestion or heaviness that can happen sometimes with Indian food. Whether you're a hard core fan of Indian food, or if you're just simply curious about exploring Indian cuisine, I highly recommend that you give Avani a try. We've gone twice already and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I used to like their food, I had their buffet, it was horrible. The service was worse than any place i have had. The food was partially cooked, when we had gulab jamun, first it came cold, then it came burnt. I can't believe this is the same place where i used to eat great food all the time. 

Food Buffet - HORRIBLE - 1/5
Service - HORRIBLE - 1/5
Alacart - Decent  - 3/5

I wish the management would pay attention."}
{"text":"It's an upscale Indian fusion restaurant.
The menu has a variety of dishes.
I love coming here."}
{"text":"I visited Avani Bistro and here are some comments-

Ambience- Nice
Food- Tasty
Service - Fast
The one thing i didnt like was no real friendliness from staff. They were professional, no issues but the attitude was same as u may visit a dhaba, then why pay over twice for the food? The food was tasty but no shortage of places in GTA serving tasty indian food. the service expectations from such places are higher, similar to any fine dining place but here they just seemed interested in us eating and leaving. Hence giving 3 stars instead of 4."}
{"text":"Was here for supper tonight. 

Free parking and the interior was nice. Also, there was a lot of Indian looking people here, so this is always a good sign that this place probably serves good Indian food. 

Overall the curry was good. I thought the chicken was a bit dry, but the lamb was spot on.  We tried the least spicy items, and I still though they had a decent kick, but I was able to handle it. 

naan bread was good. Adding some butter and garlic and dipping this in curry is delicious. This is probably not the way that Indians eat this, but it works for me and I leave no curry behind. 

I am giving this place a 4 star rating because overall the food was pretty good other than the chicken being a bit dry. I just think that the curry portions are rather small for the prices charged ($15) and that does not even include rice or bread. You have to buy the rice or bread separately. Expect to spend around $20-25 per person."}
{"text":"You won't get such delicious and authentic Indian food anywhere else. Enough of the cheap buffets and all you can eats. Indian food is meant to be cooked slowly with all the right spices and shared family style.  These guys bring in some of the best chefs to make food which would be hard to find outside India and they do it phenomenally. Try their sizzling black bean tofu with gravy, tandoori paneer sizzler, afghani chicken sizzler, malai kofta (never had one so creamy and soft), goan fish curry and lamb rogan josh. Get a reservation on weekends because it will be packed! Don't expect to get a seat right away with just a walk in!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  We went as a group of 10 people.   When we went to pay our bill they refused to split our bill because they only had one credit card machine.  When we asked if he could split our bill and some of us would pay cash he said no. That was my third time and last time I will ever go to avani"}
{"text":"A total letdown!

Food - 
Basmati rice was inferior - seemingly microwaved and re-heated, brought to us after an inordinate amount of time (for serving rice). Dried up and tasteless. 

\"Samosas\" were a \"modern\" take on the classic - but fell flat, being less than enough and mostly potato! Intensely disappointing! 
The amount of tamarind sauce was puny and dollhouse sized! Not enough. 

Customer Service - 
Utterly clueless. Although I understand her relative newness (recent hire), the server could not answer basic questions, leaving us to consult the kitchen multiple times - and even asked -us- to tell -her- what was on the menu. A sign of lackluster training. 

We found a hair in our \"Chicken Platter\" and promptly informed the staff. Instead of listening to the claim or abiding by the \"customer is always right\" phrase (the hair did not match any of the customers!), the plate was taken to the kitchen and another staff member returned to inform us that there was actually NO hair on the plate! (the hair had been removed). Instead of offering us a remedy or acknowledging the situation, we were asked \"so what do you want?\" And \"replaced\" the dish, as in - reheated it and brought it back. No protocol for this type of situation and completely unprofessional. 

Overall, not going back! - very disappointing, overpriced, and underwhelming."}
{"text":"Great food, Great ambiance perfect evening, a little heavy on the pocket but worth it."}
{"text":"Went in a group of 10. The appetizers were amazing.. but the main course was average or slightly below average at best. Service was poor. We ordered a paneer tikka masala and they brought out a totally different paneer.. we asked them what happened and they said \"oh this is how our paneer tikka is.. all our customers ask us the same thing\". They pointed out another item on their menu and said \"this is more like paneer tikka\".. umm then why are the items mis named? The waitress saw we were not happy and didn't even offer to bring out the right dish nor did she apologize. They were cold. Moreover, a waiter behind us dropped a curry which splashed onto my friend's jacket. They didn't even apologize let alone offer to wipe it clean.

Overall disappointed with this place and the service and will definitely not go back again."}
{"text":"after having tried about 20 indian restaurants avani is the best one by far. ordered the kebab sampler and each piece of meat was absolutely delicious!! the quality of meat was outstanding!! stunning visual presentation as well. Palak paneer was easily one of the best that i've tried to date as well. well worth the money!! would pay double!!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambience and the food. Definitely will visit back again. The only reason Im givong them 3 stars is because of the service. We reached the restaurang at around 1:30pm so it was closer to the end of lunch rush. They had multiple large parties (probably year end parties) We werent acknowledged or greeted at the door for abput 10mts. The person who did come by the enterance to check in on us did not greet us and wasnt even in wait staff attire. Had his jacket on and I wouldve guessed he was another customer if he wouldnt have come up to us. We were then seated down by the waitress who didnt even bother to walk us down to our table but flagged us down. If you call your self a bistro it should maintain that kinda service. We ordered a Tandoori platter which was served on a sizzler plate, Butter Chicken, Lamb Biryani and naan. The sizzler came out first within 15 mts but the rest of the food took another 10 mts to get to our table.  By that time the sizzle plate had already cooled down. The food was amazing though. One of the best Indian food we've had in the city. So the only reason I'll give them a second chance is for their food. It could be they were off their game as that had multiple large parties to cater as well."}
{"text":"pricey but food is top quality, Saag paneer was very good and the butter chicken. always packed"}
{"text":"I am not familiar with Indian cuisine except one time I tried chicken roti and so I thought I would try this place out on my lunch. After reading the reviews here about their lunch buffet I stopped by the place at 12:30pm with a couple of friends. We were seated by a waiter and handed the menu. Of course this menu was not for lunch buffet so we asked about the buffet. The waiter said \" yes, we have lunch buffet\".  He brought out 3 glasses of water and then disappeared.  A another waitress was sent out to serve us. I asked for the menu she said we have no printed menu. Ok. So five minutes after that we were given a plate of chickpeas salad and  3 small bowls of soup. We had no idea what kind of soup that was. It was slimey, tapioca taste like with faint gingery flavour. Then another dish was 6 pieces of grilled skewed chicken and 6 pieces of fried cauliflower balls presented on a plate with some kind of dipping sauce. They tasted ok, nothing special. I think Greek chicken soulvaki probably has better flavour and less spicy. The main meal was brought out in 5 small copper jugs. Each is like one cup. The waitress said something about butter chicken in one jug , another chicken in soy sauce, curried tofu, red bean sauce,  eggplant and potato curry, basmati rice,  small basket of garlic naans. The combination does not give any distinguished flavours I am not sure if butter chicken is supposed to taste a little sour. The dessert choice is nothing: only ice cream and something like of fried donut in syrup. I had one little donut, my friends each had one small scoop of ice cream.  $ 13.99 for each person + tax. This is what they call \" buffet\"? It is more like lunch combo, already set and you have no choice and no idea what you are getting when they don't show us the menu.  I don't even know the names of those dishes. They were like food samples to me. I looked around and saw some other customers who came alone, solo  were also having the same thing. So if you have a group of 3 would the portion be a little bigger I assume? But yeah, we felt like we are eating on ration.
 $16 per person.I'd pay more if I get to see the foods but everything was hidden even the menu. You only get to see the name of the dish when you order each individually from the regular menu? I learnt nothing from Indian cuisine today. This entire buffet experience was rather odd. I would not return."}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews for this restaurant. I called Avani for reservation and the person who picked the phone wasn't polite neither interested in providing any customer service and I was told that they didnt have any reservations left and I can try to get on the spot place.
Once at the restaurant I was please with the customer service provided by the Hostess taking reservations from the guests. Surprisingly Avani gets crowded on the weekends and I will strongly recommend to reserve your spot. Additionally we were there to celebrated my Husbands Bday and after Dinner we asked the staff if they have mini cakes and mentioned about the Birthday to them, they provided us with a complimentary Slice of cake with a pretty Sparkler on it. Thank you team Avani for the complimentary Cake slice"}
{"text":"One of my favorite classy Indian restaurant.  Tried mostly heavy weight dishes like butter paneer, malai kofta n daal makhni. One problem with this and any other Indian restaurant in Canada is their Naan are thick n heavy as opoose to thin, light n crispy. The place got full everytime i had been there. Early arrival recommended."}
{"text":"I was feeling for some Indian food this afternoon and Avani never disappoints me! 

Although this place is a bit on the pricier side but I absolutely love this place, you pay for what you get! Their food is amazing, I especially love their curry and tandoori shrimp, yum! This is the best Indian food I've ever had. 

The decor of this place is pretty nice and the service was great! No complains! 

Will definitely be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Review of Indian - the Indian food is amazing. You must try the tandoori sampler and chicken biryani. The malai kofta is the best I have tasted in the GTA. 

Review of Asian - This section of their cuisine could use a little more work. The Hakka noodles are too spicy and the Kung Pao Chicken was a bit too sour. I highly recommend the chili prawns though! Those are always a hit."}
{"text":"Good North Indian food. 
Spice levels and taste is more westernized than authentic Indian taste.
Service was slightly slower than expected.
Methi malai mutter and garlic naans were good. Paneer tikka masala was the best dish among all those that we ordered.
Don't be fooled by the restricted drinks menu, they have a full bar on offer."}
{"text":"An excellent choice for tasty Indian food, located close to the Heartland shopping district.  Generous portions are perfect for sharing, one app, two mains, single orders of rice and nan was more than enough for two and leftovers to take home!

Nicely out fitted dining room for a comfortable dine in experience.  Everything is fresh (including the naan, which you can watch made thru a window into the kitchen) so BE  PATIENT!  Our app was 30 mins from order and the meal itself 45 min."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Sauna. Love they have a mix of great Indian and some Hakka.  Their Gobi special is amazing. For a vegetarian this places is awesome,  lots of choices.  A little pricey, but as a vegetarian it's kinda worth it to have more choice on a menu.  Again,  that Gobi special.  So good."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good at Avani, however as many of the other reviewers mentioned the service was very poor. We were excited about having dinner there as we'd heard good things, but from the minute we walked in the Host who brought us to our table had a very disinterested attitude. We then proceeded to wait 15 mins before we flagged down a passing waiter to ask if someone could come to our table. This despite the fact that the restaurant was more than half empty.  
We eventually had dinner almost 1.5 hour after first walking in. The food was good, however I'm not sure it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food was good but too over priced for the amount you get. The service was bad. They guy came and put the food on the table and 2 seconds later hes like \"how is the food\", you would think he would give me a chance to try it first. After that no one returned to see how we were going or if we needed anything. I finally stood up to call the waiter over to ask for water which I didn't even get. Service was horrible but they were so quick to give us the bill."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! An amazing place for special occasions as its a little pricey than other Indian Restaurants. You can get the spice level adjusted to your taste."}
{"text":"the food was great!! loved the chicken kebab platter. in main course, we tried the methi chicken - excellent and the dal makhani - again, delicious! oh, and they had roomali roti, which I was super excited about! not all restaurants serve it.

service was very good. we had a friendly, attentive server.

the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I found it to be a tad too expensive. i am up for paying for great food, however, this just seemed a tad pricier than I would be prepared to pay. main dishes ranged from $12-17. the roomali roti was $4!!! I had to think twice about ordering it.

in conclusion, definitely recommended and would visit again. however, would love it if the prices were lower."}
{"text":"Delicious food, amazing decor, and great service. This is seriously one of the best Indian restaurants I've ever been to. The unique dishes are mouth watering. It is a must for me when I visit the Toronto-Mississauga-Brampton area."}
{"text":"It's so great to finally get some decent Indian-fusion in the GTA. Having recently turned vegetarian, I was excited to try something other than typical Indian dishes such as Palak paneer.  There was a lot on the menu that caught my eye but I finally went with the Kale Chaat appetizer ($11) and two vegetarian curries - Jackfruit & Kale Masala ($15) and Methi Malai Mutter (or Creamy Fenugreek & Peas also $15). 

I absolutely loved the Chaat - a healthy twist on a street food favourite. The thickness of the kale pakoras made them a little hard to eat but that didn't take away from the flavour. It was a large portion and there was more than enough for our group of 6 to share. 

The Jackfruit & kale was nice but I wasn't sold on the texture of the jackfruit -it might be an acquired taste. I will likely try it again in the future but after sampling other things first.

My favourite was the Methi Mutter - a must try for vegetarians. It's quite creamy - a bit like a spinach dip - but with the inherently complex sweetness of fenugreek that I love. 

The accompanying naans and paranthas were nice.  I also ordered a Mango lassi specifically requesting no added sugar, and it was very enjoyable although still a bit sweet. The dessert menu was limited featuring a few classic dishes such as Rasmalai and Gulab jamun. It would've been nice to see something more exciting - although Indian food is so heavy that I probably wouldn't do justice to any sort of dessert.

Overall it was a wonderful evening! Our server was friendly as well as helpful with ordering tips and answering our many questions. I know my family and I will plan another dinner here again."}
{"text":"Good Indian food. I loved their spring rolls, amazing. Their hariali chicken is the best I've ever had. Its not at the typical Indian resto prices, so its good for a celebration meal perhaps.
I also tried their lunch buffet, and was greatly disappointed. The food tastes nothing like what they serve for their a la carte."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and overpriced. Stay away from apps as most of it tastes like pre-cooked and microwaved to perfection - and ones which haven't gone through that exercise, came out really oily. We were served samosa rolls which tasted like the potato mix was boiled and filled without salt or any kind of seasoning - quite un appetizing. Chilli chicken was rubbery and vegetable pakoras were oily and mostly broccoli. Will never return."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous. The food wasn't half bad but as far as the service is concerned, it is patently pathetic. This should be a part of the manual of how not to treat customers. 

There were 4 adults and one 2 year old child in our group. We got there at 9:15PM. By 9:30 no one had come to our table. Eventually they did and I ordered a scotch and we also placed the complete order with appetizers and the main course. The child was very hungry and we put in a request to rush the order and it was okay if they brought everything at the same time rather than waiting for us to finish the appetizers. It took about half n hour for them to get us the appetizers. During that half n hour I had been waiting for someone to ask me for a refill. Never happened. 

After we finished our appetizers, we were kept on waiting for our food for another half n hour. We finally got our food at 10:40 PM. Absolutely ridiculous. Eventually we got the bill and on checking the bill I realized that I had been charged $24.99 for an appetizer which was listed at $16.99 in the menu. On asking the waitress about this, I was told we up-sized the appetizer seeing that there were 4 people in our group. We were never told about this. $8 up-size is mentioned on the menu but at least check with the guests before deciding to make a decision on our behalf. On mentioning this, there wasn't even any apology or anything. 

Worst waitress ever too. Just walked around as if she was forced to work here and someone had her family at gun point on the back of the restaurant. 

NEVER ever going back here again. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Friday night.  We shared a grilled mix meat dish and rice. Food was presented well and taste was on point.  Very flavourful.  Made us want more.  But we were satisfied with the portion. 

The service was okay.  Not a small family feel but not like a Moxie-type rush.  

Price was over priced compare to other small restaurants which would give you larger portions and the same quality food.  It was odd a $20 something meat dish did not include rice. 

Would I return...no.  I'd like to explore other similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here looking for simple, tasty, indian food and was not disappointed. While some of their East-Asian dishes appear to come in portions enough for one, their Indian food is portioned more for sharing which makes it difficult to get variety if with a small group. That aside, the food I did have was good so I'll be back to try the rest!"}
{"text":"The best food ever, the flavors were just incredible and our waitress was wonderful. Totally recommend :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, a bit pricy. Service was great. The Managolore coconut chicken was amazing. The palak paneer was tasty, thick uniform sauce and the paneers were prepared to perfection. Man chow soup was very fresh and full of flavor. Raita was too salty. 
Will be back again...."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from California, but were in Mississauga for a wedding. We found this place on Yelp and decided to try the food based on all the great reviews. And boy does this place live up to the reviews! For an appetizer, we ordered the Samosa Wraps and they were to DIE FOR! I highly recommend these. The rest of our lunch was just as delicious! The service was great - very friendly and welcoming. Now I'm on a mission to find a place similar here in California!"}
{"text":"Mine was a mixed experience. We ordered Veg Chowmein, Murgh laziz and Naans. Chowmein was really good, one of the best I have had in US and Canada. Murgh Laziz was just ok. Given the Chowmein was good, we ordered Dry Chilli Paneer but unlike Chowmein this was a total disaster! It was too sweet and lacked all other spices or the schezwan taste. I checked with the server and she said that's how it is supposed to be!! I have never had that sweet a chilli paneer. For dessert we ordered Coconut fried icecream which was another disaster, smelled of old oil and old coconut.. We ordered masala tea which came after 45 minutes and was as if they made it in literally under a minute. The staff is not very customer friendly either. Our server was busy setting up the tables for next day although they had more than an hour left was closing time.
The one star is for the good Chowmein."}
{"text":"Part of our Indian restaurant ventures, my  family and I decided to try out Avani on a Friday night. One word of advice - make sure you make a reservation, as they get pretty busy on Friday nights from our observation. 

Here's my breakdown of the review:

1) Ambiance, seating area, service (minus one instance) - excellent. 

2) I am taking one star off because the host at the front of the house was very rude. I had made reservations for 7:15PM, but however due to traffic and the weather, we were 15 minutes late. I had called on my way there, and I informed them that we will be late, and is it okay.. The person whom I spoke to on the phone said its fine, and it shouldn't be a problem. 

However when we arrived there, the host at the front said that he canceled our reservation because we were 15 minutes late. I told him that I spoke to someone on the phone and they said its fine. I even mentioned my name and telephone #. He just simply ignored it. He then told us we'd have to wait another 20 minutes for a table to be ready, and told us to sit at the bar. This was very unacceptable. 

3) Here comes the fun part, the food. Just a heads up, my family and I are vegetarians, and once again we do not know how the meat dishes are. Here's what we ordered: 

Manchurian vegetables, Dal Masar Ki, Baingan Patlala (a great dish by the way), Saffron rice, Tandoor rotis, Methi naan. 

The food was excellent and it was mouth watering. The spices were just correct, and it suited our pallet pretty well. The food tasted better than the over hyped Chef Sanjeev Kapoor's Khazana in Brampton. My favourite dish was the Baingan Patiala. The Chinese eggplant was cooked perfectly fine in the gravy, and I even liked the raisins in it too. Normally I don't like raisins in food, but this was an exception. The Dal Masar Ki was tasty as well. I liked how they used the red chili as compared to the green chili. The red chili is not as spicy as the green one. The texture was perfect and the portions were great.

Overall, we would definitely come back here, and shall recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"If there was an award for best Indian restaurant in North America, this restaurant will win it. I had the most authentic food and amazing service. 

Started with lemon soda and ordered daal, Baingan bharta and rice. Everything was perfect. Very authentic. The lemon soda was such an authentic \"shikanji\" that we wanted to order 2nd rounds too. However contained our appetite for the mains. 

Jeera rice cooked to perfection and the server was simply amazing. Daal and rice is comfort food for Indians and if a restaurant nails it, you know that the rest will be amazing. 

Surprisingly my colleague ordered fish Manchurian ( they have amazing Chinese food ( indian style) also). And he said compared to our last horrible experience at another restaurant, this was such a pleasant breeze of gastronomy. 

The menu is extensive and I cannot wait to return to  try other dishes. 

Keep up the great food and please open an  outlet in US also."}
{"text":"Pricy Pricy !! .. but yet tasty Indian food in a nice classy style. The ambience is really good .. and so is the service. I highly recommend this place for business eat ups! ..  PS: My favorite is the spicy lamb chops along with a glass of red merlot ... delicious!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, would definitely come back. The chilly paneer is a must have!
Food was fresh and service was great!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, polite staff. They just need to improve on the busy days for take outs as they mix up orders and takes the longest time to get the order ready otherwise no complaints. Have to try the chilli chicken and the tandoori rack of Lamb just amazing!"}
{"text":"Passable. Flavours and tastes were not authentic Indian. The samosa rolls were interesting but ok to taste. Not as great as it's made out to be on Yelp. Tandoori Flame is way better."}
{"text":"Food is good here and this place is always steady.  Infact quite busy at lunch time.  Personal favorites are the bhendi,  Vandaloo and the Tikka masala.  I've also ordered their seafood tandoori Platter in the past which was also quite good."}
{"text":"I've dined in once and ordered take-out a few times now. I wish I'd tried this place sooner! The food is excellent. I'd recommend making a reservation as this is a busy place. Also, the washrooms are clean, which is a major plus for me!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experince at this restauant.  The decor was beautiful and pleasing the eye, and perfect for families or couples to sit down and enjoy and delightful meal together.  I didn't find to bright or dimly lit, although, I did find it a little bit chilli at times, but then again there were a lot of windows and it was a pretty cold night.

The food was wonderful and aromatic, but not super spicy; some dishes had a little bit more of a kick than others, but not blow your head off to the point where you can't feel your lips anymore.  The serving staff were friendly and constantly coming by and filling our glasses with water.  I would definately come back here again."}
{"text":"Got takeout here based on fellow Yelpers reviews and we are so glad we did!  

We got an assortment of curries, rice naan and pakoras and everything was delicious.  Although pricier than other Indian food places, I felt the quality was quite good and well worth the money.  The portion size was fine for us although we did notice that we usually have enough leftovers for two lunches but with Avani we only had enough for one lunch.  Mine.  Hehe.  

Want to go back soon and possibly dine in so I can try that cool rice in pastry copper pot thing."}
{"text":"Went to Avani, based on reviews. Nice surroundings, the food was some of the best Indian I have tasted so far in Canada - tasty and well-seasoned, well presented and customer service was also good,...they could tone down a little bit when asking if everything is OK/if we had finished our meal...a little excessive.  I say 'A-OK' because unfortunately, plates were not clean, had to ask for replacements, also glasses had residue of food particles, not once but twice.....made me question the state of the kitchen!!  I will visit again though."}
{"text":"Complete wastage of money, food was horrible and my entire family was disappointed."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant in the GTA.  

Especially great are the various kebabs and variety of breads they make.  Those are what really set them apart from the sea of Indian restaurants out there.

The decor is also very upscale, and is great for entertaining business clients.  

We've never left disappointed - always satisfied!"}
{"text":"Good food!! Butter Chicken, Palak Kofta were quite good. Liked the ambience as well. I would say one of best in area!"}
{"text":"Food: As a party of two, we ordered chicken tikka masala and shrimp vindaloo with naan. The dishes were tasty and we were well warned about the spice level. Easily one of the best indian restaurants I've been to lately.

Atmosphere: The decor is great, and the staff is friendly. One complaint that I have however, is that me and my friend (who is not Indian) were asked to sit on the opposite side of the bar (waiting area? instead of the main dining room). We didn't question this as we thought perhaps there were no more tables for two left in the dining area.. however we later saw many other customers be seated in the dining area. Not sure what to think of this, as I don't want to jump to conclusions!

Overall: Despite the odd seating arrangement, the staff were very friendly and both service and food was very good. Although a little pricey, since all sides (salad, naan, raita, etc were extra), I would recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Food was awesome but they took forever to bring us the bill and even though we asked for separate checks at the beginning they didn't do this in the end."}
{"text":"The two stars is reflective of our disappointment with the entire lunch experience we had yesterday. We went there specifically as we do whenever we visit the area. However it was very different than all the other times we've been there. Service was not as great as the usual times we've been there and we felt that the waiter taking our order oversold the number of dishes we would need for the two of us. He stated that one curry dish would not be enough for two people. We ordered two. The curries are generous and one dish can easily feed two or three people. The curries are priced high at an average of $16 and you order naan or rice separately.  Their chaat papri was sorely lacking in any authentic flavor. A heap of yogurt and tamarind sauce was dumped on a large amount of fried papris. The curries were ok. Nothing to brag about. Won't be returning. Lunch bill for two people $50. We had two naans, two curries (one vegetarian and one meat), one appetizer and water. So much food that we took most of it home. Won't return. Not the same as it used to be sadly."}
{"text":"Great food, I am so glad to have found this place. I haven't had good Indian since I moved away from Toronto! 

We had the butter chicken, chicken vindaloo (beware the heat on this one!) Plain rice, butter rice, naan, raita and chai.

Portions were good for everything except the rice and naan, which were very overpriced for what they are, at $3.50 each! The chai was good, but was almost cold by the time it reached me.

We were happy with the quality of the food, overall it was delicious and flavorful, with a good balance of spices and texture. A little bit overpriced I think, but still in the realm of acceptable.

What wasn't so great was the service. Slow, spotty and apathetic. It wasn't busy when we were there so there really isn't an excuse for not checking up on us, refilling our water, etc. We had a different person each time and they were far between. 

If the service was as good as the food I would have rated 5 stars.

We will go back because the food was delicious, and just hope that the service gets better."}
{"text":"What's with Indian restaurants and great appetizers and going bust on main course. Anyways, appetizers are fantastic, drinks and main course is ok. Recommend trying Veg Mixed Grill platter comes in half (14$) or full (24$). If you are indian-chinese noodles fan try chowmein (NOT hakka). It's spicy and tasty.

Try going in non-peak hours else you would be dead before your food is served as their service is pathetic and they tell everyone, everytime \"Oh, today we are short on staff\". I have heard it at least four times :-)"}
{"text":"Very solid Hakka style food in a clean spacious atmosphere (which reminded me a lot of Spring Rolls for some reason). Ordered some Hakka chowmein, some crispy shrimp, a chopped salad, and chicken vindaloo (which was Indian spicy. Ow!).

If you're around Heartland for some shopping, Avani is a great spot to grab a nice meal in a non-chain setting. Service was also very helpful."}
{"text":"A Decently done place for mostly Indian food. Good decor, courteous staff and a teeny-weeny notch above average food, Good portions too.

Was disappointed with their Biryani; I specifically asked staff repeatedly if it is really Biryani or chicken rice before I ordered and was assured it is special dum Biryani but what I got was no where near Biryani. A concoction of rice mixed with some chicken curry and mint leaves, add to it orange colored rice grains - that is NOT BIRYANI. I will give it 1 star and that too is for the effort and the was it is served. So if you are a Biryani Lover, do not order one here."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very tasty. Large variety. Reasonable price for this quality. Service is good. Elegant sitting."}
{"text":"I tried this place because I liked the idea of Indian food being served in a more Canadian restaurant setting. The food was good yet not as flavorful as some of the more traditional Indian Restaurants I've had the pleasure of frequenting. The ambiance was great and they managed to keep the wonderful smells ( what i deem the worst good smells) off of my clothes. This is what I ended up paying for more than what I actually came for which was the food. The fact that they didn't live up to my expectations was further amplified by the distasteful manner in which they asked me to leave the restaurant. Not because of any controversial event mind you nor heated conversation. I kept my thoughts to myself until this point. After I had paid the bill and left an 18 percent tip on it, my kids went off the bathroom. In that 5 minutes (it wasn't more) that had transpired the manager came by and asked if I would mind waiting in the standing room only portion of the restaurant  by the hostess so they could make ready the table for the next patrons in line who didn't have a reservation like i did. It completely ruined my dinner and what little fondness I had for the place.  Suffice it to say I will never return."}
{"text":"Why I m so obsessed to this place, nice and clean. Strongly recommend combos as they serve their best in these combinations. ROGAN JOSH combo is my most favourite.  The main dish like shrimp vindaloo just under average, not that spicy and the shrimp kind of over cooked."}
{"text":"If there are more stars I would totally add them! The food is wow, the people are friendly, it is well priced and the environment is great! I totally recommend this place if you are in for some amazing Indian or Asian food!"}
{"text":"Came with moderate expectations... after all it's in the middle of suburbia and a strip mall, no less. Left pleasantly surprised.

The food was better than thought. The standout was... wait for it... the chicken biryani. Wait though, it was served in a little pot with some sort of roti-like covering on top which looked like it had all been baked in the oven, a presentation I've never seen before. Also, the flavours in the rice were actually quite subtle, with hints of spices I've never tasted so forthright in biryani before; we all agreed.

The service was a touch on the slow side, but hard to complain given that every table was full on a Thursday night. And we certainly did get our drinks refilled a number of times. The staff was painfully conscious that we (all) were waiting, and did their best to placate us.

Would definitely go back - it's always pleasant when you can taste the individual flavours in the food instead of a mishmash of that ends up tasting like just one thing."}
{"text":"Great food .. prices a bit high but nothing crazy .. service is awesome .. chicken karahi is my go to dish"}
{"text":"So delicious! We got the Chicken biryani and two other dishes. The biryani was the star with lots of flavour. They were kid friendly and had high chairs and plastic cups for drinks. Overall the service was also good and they were attentive."}
{"text":"We occasionally visit Toronto whenever there is an excuse and at least try to eat something different. The past weekend we planned to watch the new Star Wars VII movie at the Cineplex Imax in Downtown Toronto. The movie was awesome and we wanted to complement it with some great food and that's when we discovered Avani. I thought I knew all the good places to eat Indian in Mississauga but now I am not so sure. To our delight, the place turned out to be great. It is a large place with good ambiance and plenty of seating. We came late around 9pm and still place was kind of full. We were served a gentleman I believe was Aneesh. He was knowledgeable about the dinner items and made several good suggestions. We tried Kale Chaat and Fish tikka for appetizers and they were excellent. For main dinner, we had butter chicken, jackfruit/kale and daal, Their garlic naans and plan roti was excellent too. Their cooks know what they are doing. A must visit. As a side note, we ordered a takeout the next day (now you know how good it was) and were promised a 20-30 minutes turnaround but it took over 45 minutes. I was tired of waiting and wanted to leave except that we had paid and had to wait."}
{"text":"Their food is impeccable! You won't disappointed with anything you order.

Great options of vegetarian as well as non-veg people! Try their mint iced tea, mango sangria and fried mango ice cream."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very attentive wait staff. Unfortunately we went on a Saturday night; kitchen did not seem to be able to handle the volume...long long wait for our food."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Indian food I've eaten in North America. Everything was great. Well...

So we're driving from Quebec City to Detroit and I yelped this place along the way - knowing Toronto is known for its Indian food. This place came up - unfortunately, they weren't taking names/reservations by the time I called. We had a seven people. They sounded optimistic that we could get a quick table, so we showed up. This is the only part of the experience for which I do have a complaint. They were completely disorganized in terms of managing the seating situation. The lady with the list was randomly walking around, trying to recognize who was who, who came first, etc. etc. I mean, if you're that crowded, you need to dedicate someone to the host/hostess counter - not someone roaming around. She was very nice, but they couldn't accommodate our urgency as we still had four more hours of driving ahead of us. It's not completely their fault, they were getting jam packed and we arrived at 7:50pm which is probably right along with their Saturday night surge at 8pm. It would have helped if they were more organized. Additionally, they need to figure out time estimation as they kept saying yes, we are just seating you, but we ended up waiting an hour for our table. Actually, even the people that had reservations were waiting for tables, so that would've been upsetting. I think Indian people almost expect below-average service, so they just roll with it.

Actually, that's the other point. This place was geared towards Indians. I don't remember seeing any non-Indians. That's great as they're able to pack the house with that. Definitely more Indians in Toronto then there are in the US.

Once seated, the service was good. I think they were still pretty overwhelmed by the rush, but they were very accommodating. They tried their best to bring out the items as soon as we asked for them. Again, logistics... there were probably at least 4 different people coming to our table. With some improved organization, this place can run more smoothly.

But let's come to the important part and the reason I'm willing to overlook all this. The food was excellent. I mean, really awesome. The Indo-Chinese options were great and the Indian-Indian options were also awesome. Manchurian, Paneer, Jack Fruit, all great. We talked to the guys and they said all the cooks in the kitchen were from Punjab. Really made the difference. Naans were OK. These was another place that had outstanding Naan, while on this trip, but I digress. Definitely the food was worth the wait and I'm glad we stopped by. We didn't reach Detroit until like 2:30am, but it all turned out good.

I definitely recommend you visit Avani. Try to go during off-peak hours."}
{"text":"Excellent quality food. Large variety. Elegant sitting. Good service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is definitely my top pick for Indian fare in Mississauga. Delicious food, great ambience (casual enough to bring family/friends yet upscale enough for a date), and attentive service. I really only have 2 words for this place: DAT NAAN. Or more specifically, GARLIC NAAN. Mmmmm, so fragrant and scrumptious, this is one guilty pleasure you'll have to watch out to avoid overloading your carb intake.

My favourite dish to go with naan is Palak Kofta, although any curry in general would not disappoint. This is on top of my Westernized go-to of butter chicken. I have been content with most of the dishes in the few times I've been here - you can't really go wrong whatever you end up choosing. Prices were quite reasonable for portion and taste.

Verdict: YUM. Will definitely be back and bring some friends along (to get my naan fix and since the curries get filling!)"}
{"text":"I went to a 1 year old's birthday party here yesterday and everyone was raving about the food! The style of cuisine was very unique and although everything was excellent, my favourite dish was the Malai Methi Mattar. And don't forget to try their Mango Lassi! Good experience."}
{"text":"Classy Indian restaurant with a great ambiance! Service was good. But the food was just ok. Calamari was not close to what I am used to in Boston, methi chicken was good, shahi paneer was so so."}
{"text":"Delicious food but sometimes a bit slow on the food - just make sure to go when you're not super hungry :) But besides that, the restaurant has tons of options of food and everything I've had is very good. Plus the decor is very nice and is great to take out the family or a significant other for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Nice food and nice ambience!!
We went out on a busy weekend evening here and the restaurant was jam packed. Luckily we made a reservation well in advance.
We ordered a veg platter in starter and it was really good. Methi malai matar is a must try here. Naans were soft and daal makhani was good.
Overall Avani is one good Indian fine dining place to experience."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for quite some time now but never made it in to this restaurant until just last week.  I had not idea what I was missing!  The food is absolutely delicious.

Try the Chilli Paneer (dry) as a specialty appetizer - it was just amazing.  We went with an Asian palatte rather than Indian, and they suggest its better not to mix the two flavours but you can if you want to.  And all the dishes were so good.

And don't forget about dessert.  I'm not a fan of chocolate cate, normally..  but we had some kind of chocolate fudge with ice cream that was so soft and tasty I couldn't get enough.

Hands down, I will be going back here and regularly.  The quality is top notch, the service is great, and most importantly the food is just incredible.  If you have not been here, give it a try you won't regret it.

Next time, I'll have Indian... :) mmmmmm"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time going to Avani and the consistency in their flavouring and quality amazes me every time! The must have is the sizzler plate; an appetizer that includes a medley of chicken kebab, Afghani chicken, Haryali chicken and tandoori chicken. The chicken was cooked to perfection and I could literally taste the stone oven in every bite. For our main course, we ordered Dhal Makhani (buttery daal), Butter Chicken and Manchurian noodles. The noodles had a real kick to them so make sure you notify the kitchen in advance if you can't handle spicy food. Finally, we ordered 3 garlic naans and beware...they are massive! 3 were more than enough for a party of 4 so be sure to not over order. 

I highly recommend anyone that is looking for a fine dining Indian experience to go to Avani. Though their price point is definitely higher in comparison to other Indian restaurants, it is well worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"After eight months of hearing my colleagues rave about this place (as travellers, they literally go here every week), I was finally able to try Avani during a team dinner! I came in with high expectations, and surprisingly left quite pleased.

We were a massive group of 15, but despite our size, we were offered sufficient service and care. Although the ordering process took a while in terms of noting down everyone's drinks, appetizers, and entrees, we were served quite quickly. The entire meal took less than two hours!

I ordered a virgin pina colada (the only virgin drink on the table) and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was nice and tropical with the coconut cream and pineapple juice. Although I found it a little sweet at first, it became a great drink to sip on in-between the spicy curry dishes!

The entire table ordered to share among small groups of four. My group got the following to share as appetizers:

Tandoori Rack of Lamb:
This came on a sizzling hot plate; the four lamb racks were artistically placed and adorned with a ring of pickled onions. They were well marinated and extremely flavourful!

Chili Chicken:
Mmmm this is a dish to get! I found it a little sweet and sour (likely only because the lamb was so much spicier) but it was nice and crispy. Stir fried with a generous coating of sauce, it was definitely quite addicting.

I was also able to sample other appetizers, such as the Garlic Chili Prawns:
I adored the flavour profile of this dish - however, the prawns were far from being \"lightly dusted\" in batter. My piece had more batter than anything else; in fact, it was near impossible to discern the shrimp amongst the batter. That said, the chili peppers, scallions, and ginger gave it a comforting profile of Chinese food.

For mains, we ordered the following. 
Butter Chicken:
This dish didn't quite stand out among the others. I found it quite forgettable and so there's nothing to really say.

Shrimp Vindaloo:
Again, this dish fell flat. The shrimp curry was on the sweet side and simply failed to deliver. Needless to say, the dish went pretty much untouched.

Jackfruit and Kale Masala:
This was surprisingly a show stealer! It was amazingly good. Despite it being a vegetarian dish, the flavours were very complex and rich. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Interestingly, the jackfruit highly resembled artichokes / bamboo shoots in looks.

I also was able to try the following dishes from the table beside me.
Coconut Cream Chicken:
This was a refreshing, creamy, coconuty dish! It was surprisingly light and had a nice accent to it. I quite enjoyed it.

Lamb Vindaloo:
One of my absolute favourites of the night! The red curry was fiery hot and really packed a punch, and perfectly complimented the gamey taste of lamb. Delicious!! Many of my colleagues sweated upon eating this, and one definitely needs more naan for this dish.

I really enjoyed the roti that we ordered with the curry - even more so than the garlic naan, which I felt could be more fragrant and rich in flavour. A very enjoyable meal, and we were particularly surprised when they brought out two coconut fried ice creams for the birthdays of two teammates!"}
{"text":"Superb food, slow service....at least they are consistent based on what other customers have said..."}
{"text":"We had dinner here with a group of friends (12ish) and were accomodated very nice private room off to the side of the main enterance, very impressive! The atmosphere was very comfortable, ambiance was good for a family dinner or intimate meal with someone special, it wouldn't matter. The place was very clean and organized, plus did not have a strong aroma of the usual eastern cooking that we have encountered before. Service was great, the wait staff was always around, whether they were refilling a glass of water or removing no longer needed serving platters and plates, they were prompt. The food was very good, catering to vegetarian or meat enthusiasts, plus it was not that spicy except for a little something left on the palate once the mouthful had been swallowed, a very good compliment to the dish itself. I would recommend Avani if you wish to have a good meal of Indian cuisine that will leave you hungry for the \"Next Time\" and for something that'll be than memorable. The prices here are more than reasonable and worth every portion and mouthful that you will encounter."}
{"text":"Food is very good we had their \"buffet\" which is an assortment served table side, however they would rather throw out what's left then let you take it home (very wasteful), but i understand."}
{"text":"Yum.

Food is so delicious & service is so great. Really nice space - it's bigger on the inside than it looks form the outside.

We had the fish tandoori - fish so tender! Saag was great, coconut chicken curry was great."}
{"text":"Our favourite Indian food spot in Mississauga. The food is delicious and if the service was more consistent I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Easily the best Indian food I've had and I've had a lot. My girlfriend and I will travel from our place in downtown Toronto to Mississauga just to have a bite at this place.

Recommended Dish

- Mehti Murgh -- Chicken or Lamb variation -- One of the best Indian flavours I've ever had."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to try out the weekday executive lunch at Avani for $13.99. Essentially it's an all-you-can eat of limited items (not a walk up buffet) made up of appetizers, mains and desserts. They change up the items daily. 

For our apps, they brought out tandoori chicken (delicious), aloo tikki (good), hot/sour soup (very good) and salad. The mains were butter chicken (delicious), chili chicken (meh), palak paneer (good), daal makhni (very good), aloo gobi (meh). You can order these as many times as you want, as well as rice and the fresh made buttered naan. Dessert was mango ice cream  and gulab jamun. Service as previously was lacking.

Good food for the price and ambience."}
{"text":"Avani has amazing high end Indian food. We go here often, usually to celebrate special occasions, and have had a great time everytime!

Note that there were rumours floating around that their head chef left, but those were put to rest during our last visit there (a couple weeks ago for your highness' bday), as the food quality and taste were as expected. The service tho has gotten a lot shittier. 

We usually get the Malai corn rolls (mmmm SCRUMPTIOUS), the samosa rolls, dry chilli paneer, dry veg manchurian, paneer tikka and chicken seekh kebab. For mains, we usually get the malai kofta, dal makhani, a paneer dish and methi matar malai. The breads are what sets this place apart. They have the good old rotis and naans of several varieties, but their parathas are just amazing! So is their roomali roti (if you've never had one before, try it!!!).

The place allows you to bring your own cakes, etc when celebrating events and doesn't charge a fee for it. It is a pricey joint however and expect to spend between $40 - $50 per person minimum (and that is without drinks). Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Quick review

We did a take out once, and I am not going back again, we ordered butter chicken mild, it was chicken sunk in watery milk or cream they put in to dilute the curry. 
if  a restaurant cannot make a dish mild, they should just say so, also how and why the cook would do that to a dish and then serve it ?

anyway it gets really busy, and i felt like the staff was pretentious and slightly rude
it felt like they think that the restaurant is really high end, but to be honest its not, and even if it was they should put customer service first  and focus on food quality

Thanks for reading 

PS, they charge $3.00 for a naan, I found it to be little odd"}
{"text":"I have yet to be disappointed here. Food is always hot and delicious. The service is on point, team atmosphere and everyone is eager to help you. My favourite is the executive lunch!"}
{"text":"One of the more posh and decadent Indian restaurants in the GTA and it's always a pleasure to dine here.

It has a wonderful ambiance and the service is usually friendly, charming and quick. The food too is of a most excellent caliber.

Whenever we go there we order a variety of appetizers but our favourite is the kebab platter (there is a beg kebab platter for the vegetarians too!) The diverse variety of kebabs offered makes sure there is a little something for everyone. 

Also, try ordering the masala shikhanji or masala coke to go with your dining experience. The main course is also well endowed. We order the goat vindaloo or the chicken madhai or the rogan josh!  I must say, I do find their goat/lamb dishes to be superior to their chicken. Also these go very well with a Garlic Naan splattered with generous servings of chopped garlic and butter.

Finally, you HAVE to order their Biryani as its one of the best I've eaten in Canada. It's a hearty and decadent dish that's just teeming with spices and served in a 'dum' style.

All in all, it's all fantastic restaurant. A bit pricey but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great spacious restaurant, good food and decent serving sizes. The wait can be bad, and despite making reservations, we've waited. It's a popular place. It can be pricey however.

The first time I came here I did not make reservations. We waited over an hour and were about to leave when we finally got seated. I was glad I stayed. From  their apps on sizzling platters, vegetarian curries and meat curries, they were all delicious. The veggie sizzling platter is a  bit overpriced for the amount so I'd skip that.

I love the mangalore shrimp curry, jackfruit and kale curry and their naans as well.

Though busy service is good."}
{"text":"All of these stars are for the quality of the food. One of the best Indian restaurants in the country. A huge downside is the service which is slow and the servers seem to think quite highly of themselves. Feels like they are doing you a favour when serving. Also the wait times for brining the food to the table are quite significant (around 30 minutes). 

However, I have never had a bad meal there. Consistency in taste and quality is amazing each time. Hats off to the chefs and a million boos to the servers."}
{"text":"Love the food and the whole concept for lunch buffer during lunch time.  Price is reasonable.  Quality of good is great.  Service needs to be improved. Our last visit we enjoyed everything except the service."}
{"text":"I work near little India and eat fantastic Indian all the time... Love it!  So...I had all but given up on finding comparible quality in Mississauga, having been disappointed by the lacklustre spots I have tried.  Avani... You have renewed my faith in Missisauga Indian cuisine!  We had take out...ordered the Samosa Rolls, the Chicken Tikka Masala, and the Baingan Bartha (tandoori oven egg plant in aromatic gravy).  The side Naan was freeeeeeesh!  So good with just the right amount of chew and char.  The Tikka sauce was fiery, rich, and creamy all at once.  The chicken nice and tender.  The bartha was insane flavour.  Everything was so well executed.  My wife found it hot...killer hot... But couldnt stop eating.  Next time we will get the raitta to cool our jets a bit!    Honestly, everything from the high quality resealable dishes, to the fact their website has a mobile version... This place blew me away with its focus on providing patrons with a good experience start to finish.  THEY EVEN THREW IN SOME FREE CHANA MASALA!  Hello, new go to place...glad we made your accquaintance!  Do yourself a favour...stop reading...start ordering.  Thank me later."}
{"text":"Excellent Food. I usually love Gobhi65. Rest of the food is ok because almost every restaurants menus are the same. My main concern is that I don't want my appetizers and main course at the same time. It happened twice at this place that we asked the girl not to bring everything at the same time... they usually say \"oh yes.. don't worry\" and later on they'll bring each and every item at the same time!

I usually love eating food while tasting it because I enjoy eating food! But it seems they think that we are cow and we should eat everything at once. Recently this happened when my father was in town so we thought to go to one of the best places but later on the experience got worse. We ate everything cold. If I have to eat cold then it's better that I should eat at home... at least I'll eat warm food!"}
{"text":"My family and friends normally end up booking half or if not, the entire restaurant for our private parties, so we know when the service is good or bad. My first time coming here was for my neices first birthday and I was thinking it would be your typical Indian restaurant but I totally was wrong. When I walked in, I was greeted by a familiar face from high school and later I found out he's the owner of Avani. The owner helped with the birthday decor and had set up a projector & TV system for my neices birthday video. We also hired a crazy clown who entertained the hyper kids and the owner had no problems with the hectic noise level. I find some Indian restaurants to be run down or dirty but its so nice to see such a clean and nicely decorated place. Now for the tasty stuff. Since it was an 50 people event we catered buffet style to everyone with a selection of 10 different vegetarian/non-vegatarian entr√©es. The buffet consisted of, samosa rolls, tandoori & vegetable mixed grill, pakora platter, hot and sour soup, chilli chicken, some curries and fried noodles. After trying all of these,  I would say Asian fusion at its finest! The food was so flavourful and delicious, that I savoured every mouth full. The servers made sure the buffet was always full and chef made a  fresh, new batch every 15 minutes. Also, the servers filled up everyones water and came around with complimentary alcoholic/non-alcoholic beverages that tasted like blueberry fruit punch, it tasted really good! Everyone had a great time especially the birthday girl. I will definitely come back and try more things on the menu and experience a more intimate dining experience so I can give Avani, 5 star rating ;)"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my friend there for the first time and I must say the food was amazing the only negative thing they need to get a bigger place."}
{"text":"This place is so pretty. Very nice dining room, spacious and warm. The staff is great, attentive and peasant. 

The food is really good. Like, stupid good. The staple, butter chicken, was spicier than most, but on par with Sweet Palace, which is the golden standard for Indian food. The apps were really good, we had the crispy fried vegetables and they were so delicious. the paneer dishes are also great, very fragrant and delicious. 

The parking kind of sucks, the plaza is very busy and it's at a strip of road directly across from the Heartland Walmart. That's a terrible place for anything, but trust me. If you survive the left turn into the plaza, you're in for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch and was so pleased! We had the chicken vindaloo, chicken biryani and Hakka fried rice. I absolutely loved how the biryani came in a ball of Arabic roti - we loved it so much, we ordered another one for take out!! 
The chicken vindaloo's level of spiciness was just right. Usually I can't take too much heat without having to down glasses of water. But this dish was just right; the heat didn't get in the way of the flavor. 
The service was great for us too. Maybe because we went right when they opened and the restaurant wasn't crowded. All in all we didn't have anything to complain about! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Indian spots in Missisauga! 

Food:
I highly recommend the Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala. I tried the Palak Paneer but wasn't a fan. The two people I was with loved it though so it's just my personal preference for tomato based sauces over spinach. I was in a group of three. We ordered the three dishes I mentioned above and four orders of garlic and plain naan. We only finished half of what we ordered but it made for great leftovers the next day! Portions may not look large at first but it's very generous. Pricing is also good.

Service:
In the beginning we had to wait a bit for our server to come back to take our orders. After that it was great service. Our glasses of water were refilled every 15 min. Staff is very friendly.

Atmostphere:
Loved it! Nice decor and great lighting. I could see what I was eating so that's always a plus. There is lots of seating. It's great for families, groups, and even dates. We went at 6pm on a Sunday and it wasn't busy. But when we were leaving at 8pm, the place was full. I'd say that's a pretty good sign!"}
{"text":"Everytime is a great time.. Food selection is huge and confusing and most of the dishes I have tried so far are superb.. Beef vindaloo is my favorite! 
This is a very good restaurant that is maintaining its quality of food and service!"}
{"text":"I used to live close to this location for many years and I must say coming from a big family- their large portion at a low cost comes in handle for unexpected family dinners. Their chilli paneer, chicken tikka masala and bartha is amazing. I was super confused about what each food consisted of so the server (who was nice enough) to stand around and answer all my questions. The atmosphere of this restaurant is ok, nothing amazing but I feel their food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I used to love this place -- always ordered the gobi 65. The last two times I visited, I was severely disappointed. The cauliflower was cold, hard, and not fresh, by any means. After letting the waiter know of this on both occasions, they did nothing but justify the poor quality. I'm giving this two stars because it really used to be great and I'm hoping it will return to its glory."}
{"text":"Similar to others, struggling with how many stars to give, because the food was delicious but the service was horrible. We had a reservation but didn't get our food for 1.5 hours after getting seated. We had to ask 3 times for a plastic cup of water for my friend's 2 year old. At one point I gestured to our server to ask a question. He noticed me but had stopped at another table and indicated that he'd come to our table when he was finished with them...but he didn't. So we asked another server who walked by. He nodded 'yes' to our request to bring the water cup but never did. 

When our apps came out the server said our food would be ready in about 10 minutes. 30 minutes later he came over to say it would be another 5 minutes. 

Unfortunately it was also cold in the spot we were sitting and there was a draft of air and when we told our server he responded with, \"Are you sure? I'm really hot\". 

Our server apologized for the water cup but wasn't apologetic about the delay in the food. It wasn't necessarily his fault but could have been handled much better."}
{"text":"The food is really awesome and so is the service.  If you want to have authentic Indian food, this is the place to be... Try their Kulchahs."}
{"text":"First we ordered a platter of differently prepared meats (goat and chicken). These included regular sekh kababs but also exotic blends like hayalari chicken (with green herbs and spices) as well as rekha kabab (yellow in colour due to herbs and lemon). The green hayalari chicken was my favourite. Best part was the green chutney which tasted of parsley with a hint of lime and a few other flavours - not spicy but very tasty with the meats. Next I tried maybe the best prawns/shrimp I've ever tried - garlic chili prawns. They were crispy, unlike prawns I've ever tried before which were always soft (barring Japanese tempura), and came with 3 dipping sauces. My family who won't even touch shrimp, liked this. The tandoori naan was the same as any Indian place (aka great) but the filled tandoori naan was next-level - filled with onions, parsley, garlic, and cheese. Next, the chicken tikka masala curry was amazing - it's actually a Scottish-invented dish and a national dish of the United Kingdom; it's like less sweet and more spicy butter chicken (but not that spicy). Also tried spicy goat vandaloo (a Samoan dish apparently) which was basically spicy goat curry with heavy overtones of ginger and garlic. To end, we had fried mango icecream which was caramelized and glazed, and mango kulfi with pistachios in a bowl. Surprisingly they tasted differently, as if they were from different species of mango. 10/10, would come here again and again."}
{"text":"Avani provides some of the most delicious Indian food I've ever tasted, if not the most delicious. My boyfriend and I ordered the samosa rolls as an entre, which were served with the perfect blend of tangy and sweet sauces. Presentation was gorgeous. 

We then moved on to a butter chicken starter, as well as the cauliflower starter (who's name I now forget..). My butter chicken was phenomenal, and came with perfectly cooked chicken (not too dry), smothered in a light, yet flavourful sauce. The naan I ordered was fluffy and delicious.

My only gripe is the price. While the portions are huge, I think it is unfortunate that they charge extra for the naan/rice that most people would see as a requirement when eating curry. The entire bill came to 46 dollars, which I think is a little exorbitant for 2 people. Regardless, the food was delicious, and I am almost positive I will return soon with my family."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ordered takeout a couple of days ago and didn't have a great experience.  We ordered butter chicken, chicken tikka masala (so vanilla, I know), and a side of saffron rice and garlic naan.  The total came out to $40 (pricey!).  On our way home, my girlfriend notices that something smells burnt.  When we were able to check the food at home, we realize that the naan was the culprit - one side of it was completely charred.  I should mention here that on the bill was a random \"Manager's Discount\"; maybe it was to recompense us for ruining our food.  Not off to a great start.

Moving on to the entrees.  We asked for both of them to be made mild because neither of us can handle spiciness well at all.  Unfortunately, their version of mild was still too much for us.  The food was tasty to be sure, but between chugging cold drinks and gasping for air, we couldn't really enjoy it.  We couldn't even finish it; half the food is still sitting in the fridge waiting for me to decide when I'd like to try and breathe fire again.  Not too sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Coming from the UK, my wife and I are big fans of Indian food, and we are always on the lookout of recommendations.   We were given a good recommendation for Avani so we headed there last night.  

From reading the reviews, we were prepared for a longer  than normal wait, so we ordered the appetizers right away.  The waitress was very friendly, and to be fair, she did indicate up front the main course would take 45 mins given it was so busy.    The appetizers arrived within 15 mins.

We had the mixed grill appetizers and they were delicious. 

For the main course we had Chicken Tikka Masala,  lamb rogan josh, and Alu Gobi, and Garlic Naan.  Everything was perfect.  Spiced to perfection.  it took about 45 mins to arrive as had been pre warned.

The only comment we would add is that the ambiance would not be great if you are looking for a romantic dinner.  The restaurant is very bright.  They may consider dimming the lights a notch.

Will definitely return, assuming we are not in a hurry."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place close to home to have a sit down dinner. 
From the outside the place does not look like much, it is located in a plaza, but once you go in, the interior design of the place gives of a south Asian vibe.
The cutlery and glassware had a sparkle to it and were finely laid out on the table.
Our server I feel was new as he did not know much about the menu or the main courses  but made an effort to help serve us.
The downside would be the wait for the food. For a place that was not packed as it was a Monday the food took more than 40mins. 
Also the portion sizes were small compared to the prices. 
Lastly we got charged for the naan as they do not give out any complimentary naan with the dishes as most place like this would do."}
{"text":"Trusted place for Indian/Hakka/Asian in Mississauga which doesn't disappoint in terms of food and service.

Ordered : Fish tikka and Kale chat deserve a special mention . Butter chicken and Hakka items meet expectations.

Tips : Good portion size justifying price

Cost for 2: $40-50"}
{"text":"This place is good for food. Service was bit slow and foods are bit pricey. Tandoori Mix platter that cost $26 came with only 8 pieces. Some other were reasonable but some were not. Will not order this next time."}
{"text":"A half an hour drive from midtown Toronto, an oasis for foodies seeking authentic Indian food. So far every Indian cuisine restaurant I've tried in midtown and downtown Toronto has been a disappointment. So the drive towards Missisauga to quench the craving for some good Indian food was a must and inevitable. 

Visited Avani after reading it's reviews on Yelp, and was not disappointed at all. The biggest compliment I can give this place is: if the restaurant was located in India, it would do just fine. Something I can't say about a lot of other similar restaurants I've been to recently. 

The tandoori apps are on the pricey side. 26 bucks for a rack of lamb (4 pcs)....too much. We still went for the tandoori sampler on our first visit. Almost equally expensive, but at least we got to taste all tandoori dishes. Each item on the appetizer was good. The star was certainly the lamb seekh kebab. For starters it wasn't the frozen kind. It was freshly made, juicy, and full of flavours. Spices were just right. No overwhelming single spice. The Afghani chicken was also very good. 

Amongst the gravies, it was a delight to finally dunk our breads into a Butter chicken gravy that wasn't almost a dessert. The braised lamb shank has nice home style flavour to its gravy. The shank was a single big chunk of meat on the bone, so go for it if you're not sharing amongst 3-4 people. Chicken tikka masala was decent, for some reason CTM in Canada always has lots of bell peppers, same was the case here. But the dish was still pretty good. 
My only criticism would be the naan bread. Which could be a loot better. They have gone for a more thicker and softer version of the bread. I prefer the crispier and flakier version of it, which in my personal opinion....is how it is supposed to be. The laccha paratha is quite good. 
All in all, a really good restaurant that is already doing really well and had a strong following."}
{"text":"Avani is the 2nd best Indian restaurant in the GTA. (1st place goes to Mango Rain in Clarkson)

This is a beautiful large place, very nicely decorated busy for lunch buffet, dinner and parties. They have a private room and do excellent catering. We used them for our brother in law's reception. 

Expect great food, huge portions for lunch buffet an very good service. My favourites are Lamb Biryani, Tandoori Chicken and Paratha bread. Desserts are great too, although you will have a hard time having any room for them. Try their mango lassi or minted ice tea or original in house made lemonade drink with spices. Very refreshing in the summer."}
{"text":"Update: Wow, just wow.  The food aroma is so good here and doesn't smell bad unlike some other Indian restaurants that are smaller. Don't buy into the hype of Tandoori Flame for a lunch buffet, come here for quality buffet and service instead"}
{"text":"Amazing place for asian-indian fusion food. We went on a Saturday night at 9:30pm and were seated after a 15-20 minute wait. My craving for their delicious CHILI-FRIED CALAMARI ($13) sparked this second visit. It wasn't as tender as it was the first time which was a bit disappointing, but worth a try nonetheless. We also got the TANDOORI MIXED GRILL ($26) - a fairly large portion dish served on a hot sizzling plate. This isn't something I would go back for, based on how dry certain pieces were. Lastly, we got the PANEER TIKKA MASALA ($14) which was recommended by the server. We all enjoyed the curry sauce and got some GARLIC NAAN ($3 - Warning: We got 2 for 3 people and didn't finish). Sadly, the paneer itself was underwhelming and You can definitely find better elsewhere.

I do think this place deserves a 3.5/5, but the calamari bumped it up to a 4/5 for me. Definitely a must-try appetizer!

@wheresmyhoneypot"}
{"text":"Good food, good ambience, we ordered hara bhara kebab, which was a disappointment. It was sweet. Ordered palak paneer, malai kofta, dal makhani, vegetarian Manchurian, garlic naan. 

It was all excellent. The timer it took them to get there main course was 45 minutes after we ordered, so we were without food for almost 30 minutes, that was the only thing that was not good. 

I recommend it and would visit again for sure to try non veg items, as I was with a party of vegetarians this time around."}
{"text":"It wasn't too packed for dinner on a Friday at 6PM and there was quite a few parking spots. We ordered the biryani, butter chicken, chicken platter, and a paneer curry.  We also ordered the lassi for dessert. 

I thought the highlights of the meal was definitely the biryani and the garlic prawns. The biryani was wrapped in naan and you had to cut it open to get to it. It was fresh and flavourful. The prawns were equally amazing. They wee tend and flavourful. If you were looking at an appetizer to start, I'd definitely go with the prawns. Naan was refilled frequently and service overall was quite prompt.

I'd didn't like some of the types of chicken on the chicken platter. It was a bit dry but the sauce that came with it definitely did help with the taste.  The shahi paneer and butter chicken were alright.  I did like the chilli paneer. 

After eating all of that, it was time for dessert. We were pretty stuffed and the lassi was quite heavy. So be warned if you are already fill. It did taste  good overall. If I'm ever looking for Indian food in the area, I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"We are in the Toronto area again this week and once again thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. Great experience and great food once again. We had the same dishes we had the last time which were, Butter Chicken, Seekh Kababs, Rack of Lamb and Naan. The food was spiced perfectly and was consistent to our previous trip almost 3 months ago. Coupled the dishes with a good bottle of Merlot wine and it was heaven again. Love the ambiance and the food."}
{"text":"Mediocre indian food. Trying to maintain the fascade of a high end restaurant but falls short."}
{"text":"Simply the best indian food in all of GTA. This is where I recommend all of my non-indian friends to go to to get the real taste of India. Having said that, I enjoy the smaller restaurants at bramptom much more for the \"close to homemade food\" experience. Avani has a plethora of options and they are all above average to excellent. The saag, panner, chicken karahi, rogan gosh and the pakoras are top-notch. The biryani could get a lot better..a tad bit bland. A meal for 2 could cost you $60-100 but its worth it for a food aficionado."}
{"text":"Avani is a great Indian restaurant; as soon as we stepped in, we knew this place just had to be good. The place was a bit more upscale as far as indian restaurants go, it was spacious and it was busy. And we were not disappointed! 

We ordered the butter chicken with their naan (who can resist after seeing them making them right there?), and the lamb biriyani and were super impressed with both. Despite arriving in rather small looking pot, they were absolutely packed and definitely left two hungry people absolutely stuffed! And not only that, there was a generous amount of chicken and lamb in their respective dishes. The lamb biriyani confused me initially, it was covered by a naan but I thought that was fantastic to have another source of carb to eat with the lamb. The yogurt sauce provided some soothing coolness to the biriyani and some nice sweetness to the mix of complex flavors. The butter chicken was creamy and sweet and the fresh ovened naan soaked up all that delicious sauce. Both proteins were tender and the chicken was super flavorful with tandoori spices. 

The only downside was the amount of time it took for the food to arrive as it was on the lengthier side of things, but otherwise the service was excellent at Avani. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance with high ceilings and appealing d√©cor. The service was quick and friendly. We had mango lassi, buttered naan, spiced kale, lamb, tikka fish, hakka fried noodle, eggplant, vegetarian balls and spiced ice cream and chai for desert. Very nice delicate balanced flavours. A bit on the pricey side but we took a lot of left over food home."}
{"text":"Second review;-
was here on Sunday.. saw major change in food taste and quality and the service...

it took almost 50 mon to get the order with 5 reminders... and by the time rhe food arrived I wasnt hungry anymore... the food tasted different... the servers were really good though... I wish the food tasted the same..

will not be visiting on weekends or will avoid as much as possible... coz the actual food tastes way better on weekdays.."}
{"text":"If you want a good Indian Chinese Fusion experience, this is the place you want to go!! I've been here 2 times and the food is excellent. 

The spices they use at this place is fantastic, and so authentic tasting, I went to India and had tried what their curries taste like and this place comes close to that!  Everything is FRESH! and with such good quality.

The price of food is a little more than usual closer to the range of 12-16$ but it is well worth it.  The washrooms are so clean (warm in temperature) and just so nicely decorated. 

The atmosphere is very nice, in a plaza in Mississauga close to Heartland.  The place is fairly looks new, you can see their pictures online.

The service is attentive and our server was nice and was good with bringing us Naan quickly and filled our waters even though it was busy.

The presentation of the food is very good! Even the curry is placed on top of a dish with a candle in it.  The naan is cooked perfectly.. and the Samosa spring rolls are great!

These are the dishes I rate and tried:

Manchurian  Vegetarian 9/10 An Indo-Chinese classic. Lightly battered chicken
or vegetables, wok-fried with ginger, garlic and chilies.  The sauce is so velvety and the gravy is tasty, I had the mild one, but my friend had the HOT one which was very spicy tongue burning but soo good.  The battered vegetables were kind of like potato pakoras.

Samosa Spring Rolls 8/10 . Samosa filling with the herbs &spices, with some peas. I would have liked to have seen more vegetables, like corn or carrots, but so fresh and the pastry on the outside was fried perfectly crispy. Comes with mint chutney and very fresh best tamarind chutney I've ever had. Comes with chickpea curry side dish mmm! A must. Had a bit of heat.

Butter Chicken 9/10.  The butter chicken was cooked very nicely, white meat, creamy had a lot of butter and heavy cream probably.  The sauce was nice consistency, good portion. at least 2 chicken breasts.  The sauce had a nice tomato flavour and herbs were mild but present.

Karahi Paneer - 7/10 Paneer cooked with spice and capsicum. And it had some crushed cashews in it. VERY spicy, in a golden sauce , very creamy and nice nutty flavour. 

Butter Naan - 9/10 - Very fresh, hot, covered in a light coating of butter, chewy and crispy, and perfectly charred on the edges. 

Chow Mein 7/10 - chilis, noodles, with a lot of vegetables.  There was a lot of veggies and the gravy was very good, the noodles were chewy and had strong garlic taste, gravy was a little too much.

Mangalore Coconut Chicken Curry  9/10
South Indian curry where spice is soothed by coconut... the flavour is nice, not too hot, had a good amount of coconut flavour and the chicken is cooked very nicely! I love the way it was a tad bit sweet and went perfectly with the basmati rice.

Please give it a try if you like spicy, or mild, flavourful tasty rich exotic food!
Absolutely Amazing! :)"}
{"text":"Visiting my parents in Mississauga and came here with a couple friends and we really enjoyed our meal. The Mixed grill was a nice mix of meat and it was very delicious. The restaurant has a nice ambiance to it as well."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend who recommended this for good Indian food.

To be honest I drive past here all the time, and I never knew this place existed.  Its not that its small either... I think I assumed it was a spa for some reason??? Lol

Place is a good size, and very nicely decorated.

We ordered butter chicken and chicken tikka with butter naan, and garlic naan.  Both were very good and flavourful.  I really liked how each chicken piece was moist and was the chicken breast.  I hate when places don't cut off the fat or bad parts to their meat.  The garlic naan was also better than the butter naan.

The only downside I would say is price.  They don't have a lunch menu, and their dishes do not come with naan or rice, therefore you have to order it separately.
Our lunch came out to be about $50 for the two of us."}
{"text":"Pro's
Nice decor. About the only place in Mississauga if you want some atmosphere while enjoying some Indian food. That said the place is looking quite dated since I first came here at least a dozen years ago. I believe the restaurant has changed ownership at least once or a number of times since. The food has always been home style for me. That has its advantages because there's good quality meat and less oil.  The chicken biryani was good. The chicken was white breast meat and spice came slowly and wasn't overwhelming which can be the case with more dhaba food or Pakistani cuisine. The yogurt raita accompaniment was a nice touch. Still for $17  I expect more like having in some nuts and raisin inside and topped with a boiled egg Hyderabadi style

Con's
The reviews which have mentioned before the poor service are correct. The prices are expensive,  surprisingly Stella beer was only $6 not a bad price for an import. The waiter lied to me when he said I got a  10% take out discount when I compared the prices to their website."}
{"text":"I had the cheese and garlic naan and Chana Masala. Both were delicious and perfectly spiced. The mango ice tea was delicious as well. Highly recommend the food, service left a bit to be desired. Water was refilled, but we had 3 different wait staff, and our plates were half cleared. I would give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a zero star. We visited the restaurant today (June 18)evening. The person on the reception asked if we had reservation. We had no reservation and then he made annoying faces. And remarked that we should always come with reservation. He was rude and disrespectful. And he even offered us a table. The restaurant was fairly empty at that time. Even if they did not have a place, he could have simply said there is no space or there is a wait. 
After witnessing such rudeness, we opted to walk out and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"We catered a medium sized party with Avani this weekend. We got so many compliments on the food! From the beginning, working with them to set up a menu and price was a pleasure and went smoothly. We spoke with Happy and he was incredibly helpful and honest about what their best dishes were. They also gave us a delicious tasting and it helped to sort out what we wanted to order. They were very flexible and incredibly generous with the menu that we ended up with as we were trying to make very different kinds of people happy. 

Best dishes: Lamb Rogan Josh (so soft, tender, flavourful meat), Lamb Biryani, Methi Malai Matar, Daal, Chicken Hariyali (soo tasty!), Dry Chili Fish, Butter Chicken. 

Only issues: The food was not on time, had to wait almost 45-1h after our arranged time, it set us back considerably and we were setting up food as our guests arrived. Also, the paneer appetizer was not a good choice on our part as it got soggy and does not reheat well. 

Overall, I will definitely be going with Avani the next time we need to cater a party. Everyone lovedd the food and I am looking forward to eating leftovers this whole week. The selection and price was leagues better than other more popular indian catering services. Very satisfied with what we received."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place so decided to check it out. Though it's part of a mall in the middle of suburbia, the inside of this restaurant was fantastic. One of the nicer looking Indian restaurants in the GTA.

The food lived up to the expectations set by the decor. For our party of three, I ordered some Indian standards like butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, 3 garlic naan and 2 orders of basmati rice. For the uninitiated, that amount was more than appropriate. The flavour on the dishes was outstanding, the sauce for the butter chicken was complex and delicious and the vindaloo was seasoned perfectly (unlike many places, the spice level wasn't overpowering).

The presentation of dishes was nice and finishing off the meal with some deep fried mango ice cream completed a great night.

I give the place 4 stars because of the pricing. Appetizers and vegetarian options were much too expensive, if you're going to price chick peas (channa masala) and NZ lamb similarly, I'll choose the lamb everytime. 

Overall though, a solid Indian restaurant that is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Very good Indian restaurant. Atmosphere and service are top notch, and every dish I've tried is tasty. Only complaint is getting charged extra for getting rice or naan with the dish. Most places include it in the price.

I've tried the butter chicken, the lamb rogan josh, the chicken curry dish with the fenugreek, and one or two others, all of which I've liked."}
{"text":"I love the food here I just wish the service was a little better and it didn't take so long to get my food. Otherwise this place is great!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a weekday evening with a big group and was completely blown away. The location leaves a lot to be desired, as Avani is located in a strip mall with a Booster juice and some other random restaurants and across a sort of retail jungle of an intersection(Wal-mart, H&M and Krispy Kremes to name a few). 

The interior at Avani is not at all what you'd expect with the intersection in mind, as the decor is classy and understated. It seems perfect for fine dining, a business lunch or a romantic date.

Half of our group was vegetarian, so I wasn't expecting much considering it was Northern cuisine, generally known for delicious chicken. I was, however, extremely surprised with the dishes.
Some of my favourites: 

Vegetarian Mixed Grill ($24) - Fireworks... Malai (Creme) Kabab, Tandoori Aloo and Paneer and Mushrooms. The chutney is an insane blend of cranberry sauce and fiery tamarind and the paneer and mushroom tikkas are soft, spicy and crispy. 

Malai Kofta ($13) - This one is so rich it might even beat out The Host's version. It's even creamier and spicier if possible. The koftas are stuffed with a ground almond paste. 

Dal Makhani ($11) - The dal is creamy and a bit more mild, though nothing on our table was even that spicy. (Obviously, the spice levels are toned down to suit the Mughlai style. If you're into very spicy food I'd either let the server know or try somewhere else).

Shahi Paneer ($12) - After the Malai Kofta won me over the Shahi Paneer was a close second, but there's only so much paneer I can have in one sitting. 

Bhindi Do Pyaz ($13) - Though okra is quite easy to make, it's the spices that set this one apart. I'd pay for the recipe. Maybe a cookbook is in order for Avani. 

We also ordered a random assortment of naans and I recommend the pudina parantha. It's so flavourful that it even works on its own. 

The service was amazing and seamless. Our server was extremely knowledgeable, unpretentious and courteous. Our dishes, served on cute warming stands came out promptly. The next time someone asks me for a good Indian restaurant in the west end, I'll be sure to point them here."}
{"text":"Nice decor and great Indian taste! We ordered veg sampler, cheese chilly, malai kofta, paneer tikka masala and dal makhani.. All Indian authentic taste.. Paneer tikka in sampler along with green chutney was amazing.. Garlic naan breads were great as well.. Absolutely loved our last night visit!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to dine in. 
Pros: Good food, Great ambience, reasonable pricing.
Cons: long wait times over the weekends. Better book a table in advance. Food takes a forever to be delivered, but is worth the wait.
Food: paneer chili didn't have any spice in it, was good but not spicy.
Staff: very understaffed for the amount of crowd they get.
Hakka noodles is the best I have had in Northern America."}
{"text":"Went to dinner this past Saturday night. Place was PACKED....a good sign. Slight mix up with our reservation, but was sorted out quickly. Stand out dishes were the lamb chops & Gobhi 65. If you're looking for a higher end Indian dining experience, options are limited. This is one of the best!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here on Friday. I finally got around to trying it early Saturday evening... 
It all started off great... I was praising the restaurant and making comments like \"this is one of the better curries I've had\" \"we'll definitely have to go back\". 
Long story short... I've been up since 3 am with the worst food poisoning of my life. (No exaggeration) 

We ordered the channa masala and the egg plant dish... No meat or seafood. Kind of scary and very disappointing since I had high hopes this would be a good spot. 

I leave for vacation Monday and I'm trying not to let this put a damper on anything but yeah I will definitely not be back"}
{"text":"We had the lamb vindaloo, jackfruit and kale curry, Mangalore chicken curry, and tandoori variety thingy... In addition we had saffron rice and plain naan. The lamb vindaloo was delicious. The jackfruit itself was not flavourful because from a can, but the curry was delicious. I would not recommend the chicken curry, the chicken was dry and curry was bland. The tandoori variety thingy had chicken, lamb, and kebabs, it was delicious. The naan is much better than the rice. This is a moderately expensive place but the curry choices are unique and would probably visit again to try different curries or Biryani."}
{"text":"Summary:  Terrible value for the money, rude and unhelpful inattentive service.

Basically, who would eat here when there's places like Bombay Chopsticks or Chili Chicken House both in Mississauga?  

My experience here was bad even right from entering the restaurant.  The \"manager\" guy, scrawny Indian guy with a girly stud earring in his ear, is as surly and unhelpful as they come.  Didn't really answer ANY of my questions about the menu, and couldn't even bother to give me the time of day after he took my order.  Not a thank you, or a smile, or anything.  I want to slap this guy.

Now lets get to the food -- which is extremely overpriced for the cuisine, and the menu flat out lies about some items as well.

Their ridiculously priced chili chicken ($14 or even $15) is described on the menu as white meat, which is my preference, however when I arrived home with my takeout order, it was at BEST a mix of white and dark.  More like 80% dark pieces.  The portion was wack, incredibly small for the most expensive chili chicken you will ever purchase.  Flavor was acceptable but in reality not a whole lot different from what you could find at any other place.  And it was mostly gravy and sauce while the chicken itself was very scarce.  Other reviews have mentioned this, and it is definitely a problem.

Their veggie hakka noodles which is a $7 dish MAXIMUM at any respectable establishment is a whopping $12 here, and again, a smaller portion than you'd get anywhere else.  I wouldn't keep complaining about portions IF the quality and ingredients were above the ordinary -- but they truly were not.

I've heard good things about their chili calamari, but the guy working who took my order was so useless I don't even feel the need to spend money here ever again.

I can guarantee you better food from Chilli Chicken House or Bombay Chopsticks, at least from my perspective.

No idea why the ratings here are so high, maybe its due to the cleanliness and modern ambience?  But that doesn't excuse the poor value and poor service.

I won't return."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it was really busy. We had a wait of around 30 mins. Unfortunately, they only take reservations 48 hours in advance and only during off peak hours. 

We ordered drinks, chilli chicken and samosa rolls to start of with. The service was a bit slow. The drinks were pretty standard and appetizer was unimpressive. 

For mains, we ordered the tandoori mixed grill which had a good combination of meats. The meat was well marinated and pretty tender. Overall a good experience but a bit pricey. I would visit again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Really good food. Everything we got tasted amazing. The fish pakora was excellent and the fish curry also. Loved it. Service was good. Very friendly and fast.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Hot hot hot menu! I love it but my tummy does not like the chicken vindaloo... Very spicy. I love the interior design of this place - gorgeous and I feel like I'm in another country... If you like Indian cuisine try this restaurant. I have to go back soon, it's been a long time! Hope to see you there too! Very romantic atmosphere. The food here will cause you to crave it, it's that great."}
{"text":"The food is great and so is the decor, however the restaurant was closed 2 out of 3 times that I visited. Too many closings not good. Not sure if I will risk going there again. It is sad as it is very close to my home in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The indian food here is delicious and the service is wonderful. We had the grilled chicken platter. The spices and variety in flavor was delicious. We then ordered garlic naan, chickpea curry and butter chicken. All the dishes were perfectly seasoned and the naan was light and fluffy. The waitress was attentive and the ambiance was lovely. Very clean and quiet. Overall, this restaurant provided a lovely dining experience for Indian food in Missisauga. However, please note that the prices are higher than an average Indian place."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, but way too over priced for such small portion sizes."}
{"text":"Visiting from Detroit.

Ambiance-sutle, lights are good not too dark not too flashy. Music is little loud, can go 1 or 2 notch down.
Presentation-Good, Clean.
Service-friendly, you can ask for suggestions. There are many dishes are not on menu which you can order.
Food-Depending on what you order. Could be very oily. Mutter Methi Malai was out of the world. Perfectly spiced and flavored.

I will definitely comeback."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Indian restaurant so far in Canada!! This was our 2nd visit to this restaurant. When we reached the restaurant it was full and we did not have any reservations so we got their bar tables. It was nice not as usual bar seating of other restaurants. Restaurant was super busy and the line was going outside the restaurant and the wait times was about 30-40 mins. So my suggestion would be to make reservations before you go.
We ordered Lamb seekh kebab and chilli chicken in starters. Lamb seekh kebab are the best I've had so far in Canada. It's tender and juicy with perfect seasoning. Chilli chicken was amazing. It was as good as you can find in India. Pretty authentic!!
For the main course we ordered Methi murg with pudina paratha and garlic naan.
Methi murg was delicious exactly the way it is supposed to be cooked. I was soo happy after having this because you don't get good gravies in Canada except butter chicken but this was super authentic. This gives me courage to try their other gravies too.
Pudina Paratha was too good, flaky and crispy as it is supposed to be. Garlic naan was good too.
We had so much left over which we asked our server to give us in takeout containers to have next day. We also ordered veg chowmein for takeout to have next day in our lunch and let me tell you it was amazing. Very close to Indian Hakka.
I am definitely going back again. Infact, I feel going back right now.... hehe 
P.S: I just want to request the restaurant owners to maintain the quality or may be improve it even more to make it the Best Indian Restaurant in the world. You have the potential and you guys can absolutely do it. I don't want to lose this great find."}
{"text":"You get the smell of pungent non veg as you enter the resturant. .. nonetheless I can't say about the food as I was refused to be served coz I didn't make a reservation.

 It make sense to refuse if the resturant was full or there was any waiting. But there was none, it was more than 70% empty.   I had gone there around 6:30 pm and waited till 6:45 pm to see if anyone with reservation came...nobody came and I too decided not give them my business... this one resturant is off my list."}
{"text":"I am in love.

Everytime my family comes to visit, we trek out west to eat the delicious Indochinese food served by Avani.

Although the Indian fare is also delicious and spot on...I am dreaming of when I can go back for some black bean tofu.

The highlights:
- TOFU in wikid black bean (5/5)
- pan friend noodles (4/5)
- chilli chicken (5/5)
- tandoori shrimp (5/5) ..we had to order another serving!

Please go here.. you will not regret it.


Note: More of a family place!"}
{"text":"Who would've expected a nice restaurant in Heartland eh? Out of all the places that it could've been, Heartland? Regardless, parking can be tricky here. It gets pretty crowded, especially with the traffic from all the other stores. The decor in the place was spectacular. I would definitely come here again just for the decor haha. 

Not gonna lie the food was delicious. We'd gotten the Avani Chili Fried Shrimp and the Mangalore Coconut Curry. (Yes, I cheated my vegetarianism that day.... my mom forced me to lol) It was awesome. Really good. Definitely different from normal Indian food I've had. It is indeed a fusion restaurant. Be warned, the curry, if it says it's spicy. It's spicy haha. Coming from a guy who can handle his spice, it had the decent level of spice. So for all of you who despise spice, BE CAREFUL! YOU DON'T WANT TO DIE! The shrimp was definitely different, spiced with ginger, and onions, and omg just a must-try.

I'm only giving this place a 4/5 just because I felt this place was a bit pricey, but definitely a second visit is in order. I would definitely go back and try all the different things they have to offer. Simply delectable."}
{"text":"@AvaniRestaurant #INDIANFOOD #INDIANBISTRO #AVANIBISTRO

Definitely one of the classier, more upscale Indian restaurants. I love the whole branding - the logo is as tasteful as the lovely interiors. And the Heartland location is convenient to many. It's a great restaurant for a date night - and if you just want to go over for a few appetizers and drinks, it's perfect as well. 

At Avani, you don't necessarily need to order a full meal. Infact, I prefer ordering bits and pieces over drinks because of the vibe. Order a few starters and some selection from the tandoor and you're set! 

I have a friend who raves about the weekday lunches here, but I am yet to give it a try. I haven't been in a while and this review is making me salivate - so I'll be at Avani sometime soon."}
{"text":"This place is delicious...great food with great flavor. I highly recommend the Chicken tikka and chicken lazis...the hakka noodles are delicious too. For dessert the warm gulab jaman and fried ice cream are an excellent choice. Along with great food the service is great too!!"}
{"text":"This was, by far, some of the best Indian food I have ever eaten. I am SO glad I came here! 

We went on a Tuesday evening around 5:30 so we were the first people in there for the evening opening. Our waitress was very patient explaining what things are and helping us decide what we wanted. 

We weren't in a rush or anything, so we thoroughly enjoyed our two hour dining experience. It was after dinner, though, that we found out that everything was made to order from the drinks to the naan to the entrees. Even their chai tea was made from scratch and to order. To me, that explains why everything was so great. If you're in a rush, this restaurant isn't for you. 

We ordered the chicken sampler, chicken korma, methi lamb, braised lamb shank masala, garlic naan, and gulab jamun for dessert. The chicken korma was creamy and rich, the masala was hearty and full-bodied, the methi lamb was spicy and bright. It was a fully rounded experience for the curry dishes going from mild (korma) and to fuller spicy (methi). 

The sampler was a beautiful array of dry cooked meat that was in no way actually dry. My normal experience with tandoori style meats are usually dry and chewy (aka over cooked) and this showed me that there is a different way to enjoy it. 

In case you can't tell, I'm in love with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service...  Enjoyed it, coming back for sure. Wine selection was shitty but,  hey I went there for food not the wine."}
{"text":"yeah. it is pricey. it can cost up to 50$ per person including drinks and deserts. But the food was really good. Service is also great, they know what you are thinking. Our host was anish and he did modify couple of dishes to suit our needs. I would go again there without any issue. I have tried all veg foods only. other people might have different experience with meat dishes."}
{"text":"The server was not very knowledgeable about the menu and did not inspire confidence. It took a while before our food came, my daughter got the wrong dish, and my wife's rice was almost cold. To be honest the dishes tasted great but bad service and the wait would dictate that I would never go back."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Nice ambiance. Food had been consistent but since last three times it's been constant decline in quality. I hope they bring back the old Avani. But other than that for any Non Indian folks this could be a good introduction to Indian food."}
{"text":"You should come and explore own ur own coz i have no words..... i hve ordered fish pakora, non veg platter, chicken tikka masala, goat curry and garlic naan. Dinner ended @ sweets \"gulab jaamun\"...."}
{"text":"Wow the food was out of world.  Dont miss the SeaFood platter and the Lamb Chops - to die for.  The menu is huge - there is something for everyone.  We were a group of 12 but everyone got what they were looking for.  Service is great."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and it was amazing ! The executive lunch buffet, has it all if you need mouth watering food at a decent price.

 It was 13.99$ per person (drinks extra), and more than enough quantity of food. 

They can enhance the type of vegetarian food served for lunch. If you eat chicken, then just go for it."}
{"text":"I found this gem while looking for a new restaurant to try near a new jobsite.

The layout of the restaurant was very nice.  Nice artwork, tables, chairs, dishes.

The place was very clean and the background music was pleasant.

I must maintain a gluten free diet.  The waiter was very helpful in helping me find food that I could eat.

I had the meat lovers plate.  Chicken served in many styles, including an afghani style chicken.  I also had a very nicely spiced Indian quinoa that was also excellent.

The meat lovers dish is a lot of food.  Probably a better fit for two if shared with a rice or veggie dish.

The food was the way I like it which is very spicy.  If you don't want your food spicy, you will want to let them know when you order.

I found the prices to be very fair for the quality and portion size of the food.  I will go back.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am really struggling on how to rate this place. The food was pretty incredible, some of the best Indian I've had in my entire life, but the service was some of the worst I've had in a long time. I really hate giving negative reviews, but we definitely had issues.

I think I'm going to go with 3 stars with the caveat that you should not attempt to visit this place on a Saturday night, or if you do, get a reservation. Don't be like us and just show up, because this place is really popular and was incredibly packed when we went in.

We were warned of the long wait, and it was at least half an hour before we were offered a seat at a high top near the bar area. We ordered some of the stuffed naan, because that sounded really delicious and we were starving. We figured that we could use that as a snack while we pored over the menu.

We got the naan, but then the server disappeared. It took about another 20 minutes for her to get back to us to take our main order. We ordered samosas, Chicken Korma, and then she started to leave... before we were finished ordering.

\"No, we wanted Mangalore Curry also!\"

\"Oh ... okay.\" 

I dunno, maybe we were just not communicating effectively. It was pretty deafening in there. Maybe it was because it's not customary for a party of 2 to order so much food (I actually noticed this, a couple of tables seated near us were splitting one dish.) I am not entirely sure, and our server wasn't really that forthcoming.

We were not in a drinking mood that night, so Lee ordered a soda. I am not a soda drinker, so I stuck with water. Unfortunately, the server never stopped by to refill my water, even after I requested more.

The food was incredible though. The stuffed naan was delicious, cheesy and fresh and soft. The regular naan was also delicious. Both curries were wonderful, full of flavor and delicious. I am still thinking today about how delicious it was. Like I said, the best I'd had my entire life.

I would go back here again, because I think the quality of the food is worth giving them a pass on service at least once, but I really think I'd only go if we had reservations."}
{"text":"Fantastic food for reasonable prices.

What a fun experience. So many amazing and unique flavours in all there dishes.

They offer a lunch special which is 3 courses of food an is only 14 dollars.

High recommend  if you are nearby!!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent Asian Fusion restaurant in Mississauga. We order the Chilli Chicken which was excellent for the apple. Hot but not crazy hot. 

For the mains we had Butter Chicken which was beyond delicious & Shrimp Biryani. Hot in flavour & temp but indescribability fabulous. We had a side of wok fried mixed veggies as well. To top it all off...the garlic nann was house made & off the chart great!! Damn...id do it all over again NOW!!"}
{"text":"Great place for Indian Food in Mississauga,
The atmosphere is classy, the device is good and the food is delicious. 
I would recommend the Gobi 65, Bhangain ka Bhartha & either of the Vegetarian or Non- Vegetarian Sizzlers"}
{"text":"Go to joint for Indian food. Food is always good but the wait staff can be a hit or miss."}
{"text":"Consistently good food. It's asian-indian fusion, so it's not just your typical Indian dishes and naan. They have really good hakka food, especially the noodles, which aren't as oily as other hakka places. The food is still very heavy though, so it doesn't take too much to fill us up, especially because we always get the mango shakes. The only issue is that they're a little bit on the pricier side, but I personally think it's worth it.

I definitely recommend this place if you haven't been yet!"}
{"text":"I'm on a mission to find the best butter chicken in In the GTA. I went out to grab dinner with a couple of vegetarian friends of mine and this place was a good middle ground for all of us as it had something for everyone. We ordered a few dishes for the table and shared. 

The food: 5/5

We ordered: Butter Chicken, Hakka Fried Noodles and Butter Naan (and a veggie dish that I don't know the name of)

The Naan was good pretty standard for most places. I should have gotten the garlic Naan as that's my favourite from Tandoori Flame across the street.

The Hakka Fried Noodles were great! Spiced perfectly, they describe them as spicy but I didn't find them extremely spicy but if you're not a fan of spice I'd avoid them.

The Butter Chicken was excellent! Definitely one of the best I've had! The sauce was perfectly spiced and there was more then enough to enjoy with the Naan.

The service was good be prepared to wait for your food as everything is made to order and so it takes a while for food to come out but good things come to those who wait and Avani is definitely a good thing!

I will definitely be back here soon!"}
{"text":"whenever i plan to go out side with my family my first choice is Avani because i really like there food and presentation of food. place is very clean and decoration is stylish. my kids are very picky for food however they also like to go there and enjoy there food. i definitely recommend to my friends and family to go there and test their food."}
{"text":"GET THE CHILI PANEER!

You won't regret it - Avani makes the best chili paneer I've ever had. The portions here are decent for the price point, but the taste is so amazing I come back at least once a month. The chicken and paneer tikka masala are also to die for. It's so flavorful and delicious, such a treat for your taste buds!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and lovely atomosphere, will definitely re-visit!!

We ordered the Okra Crisps to start, and butter chicken and lamb biriyani with butter naan for main. Food took quite a bit to come but it was worth the wait. Okra Crisps were so good that we cleared the plate within 10 minutes! Butter chicken was delicious. Lamb Biriyani came in a pot with a layer of crispy bread over, which the server cut it open for us. 

Dessert was lovely, I always get the spongy white dessert (rasmalai?) and deep fried mango ice cream. Yum!!!

Large portions with lots of meat, only problem is that our server seems to disappear quite often. We asked for the bill and he just never came back - we ended up asking someone else, whom brought us our bill right away."}
{"text":"The food at Avani is always so good.. Be it their executive lunch or their ala carte menu dinner, we've enjoyed both.. Service is ok but overpowers the quality and the taste of the food. Mostly we've order to go but dining is good as well, just that it's way too busy always and very noisy.."}
{"text":"Food was good. Pretty nice ambiance. 

However, I felt discriminated being the only asian guy in here. Would probably not come back based on service."}
{"text":"My first time at this Bistro Restaurant left me duly impressed and desiring more. The dark sophisticated ambiance is perfect for socials as is the food; Not too spicy, not too greasy but rather light and seemingly healthy. The desert however, was finger-licking good. Service; Average, plesant while losing points on promptness. A very warm experience overall. I can't wait until the next time!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Good food en friendly service. Water is on the house. Not to expensive. From mild to hot. Had a cold and did a hot dish 
They even had some good import beers. Did enjoy a Stella, Belgium pilsener. Oh, good ambiance with some easy \"Tandoori\"-style music. Did enjoy it."}
{"text":"One very busy place. 

If you are attempting to go here without a reservation, good luck.

However, this place is absolutely amazing when it comes to it's tandoor oven. The tandoori chicken is hands down the best I've had in North America. 

Very tough though debating on what to give this place, on one hand, great food, on the other hand, just horrible service. 

When it comes to catering however, these guys are also the best."}
{"text":"This place would be an excellent date place (so men pay attention and take your lady here). My boyfriend and I were playing frisbee all afternoon and looked up Indian restaurants because I had a craving. We decided on this one. As soon as I walked in and saw the beautiful decor I thought maybe we should leave. I felt a little out of place showing up in my attire but glad we didn't leave because the food was amazing. Next time though I will wear a little black dress to go.
We had samosas to start, butter chicken and the chicken masala. All were delicious. It was a little expensive as you had to pay an extra $2-3 for the naan and rice each but we ordered the garlic flavored naan and it was worth it. Plus the portions were hearty so even though the price was a little steep you're going to take food home with you and get a couple meals out of it. 
Great food, lovely decor, a definite place restaurant to go."}
{"text":"Authentic, freshly prepared Hakka & Indian food.  Great vegetarian options, tandoori grilled chicken, lamb & seafood was delicious.  Love their mango lassi yogurt drink & masala chai tea!"}
{"text":"Staying in Mississauga overnight since my flight out of Toronto Pearson was the next day. Yelp came thru again; looked for a good eatery and discovered Avani. Ordered butter chicken, chili paneer, and roti to go. It was a little spendy for just one person, but I wanted more than one dish. Some people mentioned that service was slow; it's very fast if you ask for a take-out order (only took around 10 minutes on a busy Friday evening). Almost all tables were full of Indian folks so I knew I was in a popular local spot. Food was excellent! Butter chicken was smooth with a hint of spice, chili paneer had a little bit of crisp and sweetness with a solid chili spiciness. Avani is at the end of a small strip mall across the street from WalMart... very unassuming and I would have had trouble finding it without the GPS in the car. But so glad I ate here instead of the Subway across the street from the hotel!"}
{"text":"Very good food. The portion isn't very large and it is slightly expensive but every once in a while it's very good! Very well cooked meats and have tried 40% of the menu and enjoyed most of it. Ate in twice and no problems with service, but usually do take out and have also catered a few times with no problems!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty big and we went before 7pm so we didn't have to wait. But it gets really busy afterwards. 

I love the food. My favorite is the stuffed naan and papri Chaat. The stuffed naan is good to eat on its own. If it's for wrapping the masala or curry, original naan would be better."}
{"text":"Pretty impressed with Avani - it's certainly one of the best places I've eaten in the area, especially for Indian. 

Don't be put off by the boring strip mall location and somewhat bland interior, because the interior is really nice. The walls are painted in warm neutrals, and there's just enough (but not too much) Indian-themed d√©cor. It's really very nice. 

If you're drinking, they have a full wine and beer list (not entirely sure if there is a bar/liquor). Prices on wine - at least bottle prices - looked fairly high to me. Appetizers definitely tend toward the \"fusion\" end of the spectrum - no pakoras or samosas - think chili fried calamari. There's a good listing of Asian/Indian/fusion specialties but we all ordered traditional Indian curries.

One person went with the Mangalori Curry which is a spicy sauce/coconut milk combo. He asked for it to be made mild, which was accommodated. It was really tasty but I think would have been much better if prepared at the intended heat level (just FYI). Another person got Tikka Masala which had one of the most flavorful Masala sauces I've encountered. I went with Chana Masala which was a tad spicy and full of delicious flavors. Portions are more than generous, but be aware that you have to order rice separately which adds about $4 to the price of a dish. Of course, we went with some naan which was the perfect combination of fluffy top and crispy bottom.

Service was \"ok\". Our orders were taken promptly and food arrived quickly but we never received refills on drinks. Also, when I sat down the napkin at my place (rolled around the silverware) was noticeably dirty, as in, someone had used it. Gross! Fortunately, I noticed before I used it.

Overall - great authentic food, classy d√©cor and so/so service. I'd absolutely come back."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and the ambience inside was beautiful. The food came out in a decorative way but we had asked for some accommodations with the spice level that were not exactly done correctly. Towards the end there was also a miscommunication and one of our dishes was discarded by the server that we wanted to take home. Other than that the service was good and attentive and the food was tasty. It's definitely a nice place that I would recommend other than the things that I kenti"}
{"text":"If you're trying to make a reservation for a couple hours before closing, they won't take you. Apparently, it takes 2 hours to feed their guests so if they're closing at 10, they'll stop seating at 8.
I wouldn't count on any lasting success for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Where do I start.. so I've been here about 6 to 7 times now within the last 4 years. Needless to say, each time I go, I find myself less and less impressed. The food is good, with the exception of the non-Indian portion of the menu. I'm not sure if they use different chefs for Hakka because it always turns out terrible, and the chicken quality sucks. The tandoori menu however never fails to oblige. Service is very slow especially on busy days.. we had to remind the waiter we were still waiting on various items atleast 3 times. Making reservations on a busy day? Forget it, they only take walk-ins. You'll be waiting atleast an hour before getting a table. Step it up Avani."}
{"text":"Try: Chicken Biryani

Very good Indian restaurant recommended by knowledgeable Mississauga locals haha. All the dishes were very well presented and yummy. We ordered the Chili Paneer, Chilli Prawns, and Chicken Samplers to start, all delicious and flavourful. The highlight to me was Chicken Biryani, it comes in a cute ceramic pot and covered by a pita-looking dome, my guess is to keep in the moisture in because the rice as well textured and infused with chicken goodness. The Chicken Tika Masala was very good too, goes wonderfully with the garlic or butter Nan. Although I wish it was stronger in taste but maybe that's just how it is. 

I also really liked the mango lasi, it tastes like a mango yogurt smoothie, but not overly sweet. It was a good end to the meal!

Would definitely try again."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night after having heard good things from others I know that have been.   I had a great experience.  Flavourful dishes, high quality ingredients are clearly used.  On the pricier side but you get what you pay for.  Rogan Josh was fantastic. Properly cooked and spiced lamb is one of my measuring sticks for Indian food and they made it perfect !"}
{"text":"Food wise is was okay 2/5. For apps we got chilli chicken (no flavour), chilli paneer (it was good), prawns (too much garlic). For main course we had butter chicken it was great, shahi paneer this was okay. Vindaloo chicken, was not spicy it was good tasted like Karahi chicken. Now for service, we initially came here to celebrate a graduation so we came in asked for champagne, they don't offer it so we asked for a sangria pitcher, which is on their menu and the server said they don't serve it. After an argument of why it's on his menu if they don't offer if he came back with a champagne bottle which he found in storage. Cheap champagne $14  at LCBO, ovbs triple the price here. Then we wanted a cake since we were celebrating, they didn't have cake so they sent someone to buy one after. Overall I will not return again the servers are snobby and they only listen if you argue or raise your voice. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Nestled away in a strip mall in Mississauga you wouldn't think you would find a gem of an indian restaurant. Be prepared for a fusion of indian food, and hakka food to tempt your taste buds. 

If your a lover of indian food, but are kinda tired of the same old flavoured curries, get yourself over to Avani. The food is absolutely tasty. I have never been to an indian restaurant that takes typical North American flare and blends it so well with Indian spices the ( Tandoori Fire Roasted Rack of Lamb) is unreal. The chilli paneer is also very good. Be careful not to indulge to much on the apps. Roomali Roti...very good.

If your planning on a weekend visit, they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait. With that said, I was with a party of 4 and I didn't have to wait for more than 15mins.

The service does leave a little bit to be desired, and that is the only reason i won't give this place 5 stars. I mean really, how many times do I need to ask for water, before someone actually brings it..try 5.

The decor is beautiful, very modern with a very ethnic touch.

if your looking for a nice indian place for dinner or lunch, this will surely impress you."}
{"text":"Frustrated with my recent choices for Indian food in a clean and 'upscale' environment, one of my Indian co-workers confided me in that she really liked Avani.  She never mention this in our lunch group before because 'all' Indian thinks this place isn't 100% authentic. She thinks otherwise and loves it when her children 'forces' her to come here.  After coming here twice (once for dinner and once for lunch), I'm joining her in the love for this authentic place.

This restaurant is near the southern part of Heartland shopping and it's quite close to the 401.  So it's quite easy to get here and you're not trekking forever in the suburbs.  The restaurant is a stark contrast to most Indian restaurant.  It has a very modern vibe but with an South Asian twist.  The restaurant is washed in gorgeous shades of gold, russet, red, and chocolate brown.  It's open and well lit with large windows allowing the afternoon sun to filter in.  It's also very clean!  Everywhere from the lobby to the bathroom is quite spotless. 

Service here is approachable and friendly.  They smile and don't act bothered when you ask them questions.  Throughout the dinner and lunch, I never had to ask once for a refill or had moments where I was searching for a staff member.  I actually found some of the staff the best I've ever experienced from an Indian restaurant.  

To my tastebuds, the Indian food is pretty authentic.  I can see how there are some liberties that the chef takes... not all things are 100% true to an Indian grandmother recipe but they're a far cry from food court or jarred curries. I didn't bother with the Thai and Hakka side of the menu since I was enthralled with the Indian dishes.  My favourite appetizer so far include pakora platter (fresh and crispy fried battered goodies... the fish is moist and the vegetables are still crunchy (in a good way) under the batter) and chilli fried calamari (dusted with light coating of flour and spices, it's flash fried.  It's soft, tasty, fresh, and with the perfect crunchy coating).  They really know how to deep fry without making things heavy or oily.

I love all the mains I've ordered as well.  Tandoori chicken and kebab platter shows off great marinades on succulent charbroiled meats.  The chicken is moist and the spices yogurt provides a great flavour that is enhanced by the nicely charred bits.  Normally I don't like lamb but the lamb kabob changes my mind.  It's not gamey or tough.  Sure it tastes like lamb but it's soft and easy to bite through without a knife.  Chicken palak is creamy and loaded with flavourful garam masala, garlic, and onion.  I could scoop this all day with the great naan they give you.  Speaking of the naan, it comes blistering hot with a soft pillowy interior and buttery mildly charred exterior. Though it's not as large as the naan I had at The Host, it easily rivals them for flavour.  

This restaurant is priced higher than most Indian restaurants I've been to but the service, consistent great quality, and atmosphere makes me believe that it's worth the extra dollars.  The menu is fairly large and I've yet to make a dent so I'm definitely coming back to try more."}
{"text":"Nice food, great ambience and service. Been here for four tunes and plenty of time take away. Never been disappointed. Though little costly. But good things don't come cheap!!!"}
{"text":"Went back again this week with my parents. And the food was again amazing. My favourite place in Toronto I should say"}
{"text":"Great place for dining ...very good food ...veg or non veg both are xlent...Gobi 65 is yummy..crispy very tasty..chicken Tikka ,seekh kabab ,naan everything we ordered was very good highly recommended...except for slow service...before going make sure to book your space...wait is longer.."}
{"text":"--- Food --- 
First time coming here, I tried the butter chicken curry for $15. The sauce is delicious, the chicken is mediocre as it seemed a little on the dry side. Note that ordering rice is extra ($4.50). They are able to customize the sauce to your preference - less creamy, less spicy, etc. My friend whom ordered the Jackfruit & Kale Masala ($15) said it was delicious as well. It's a vegetarian dish! 

--- Atmosphere --- 
Good atmosphere inside the restaurant for dining. Make a reservation beforehand as it can get quite busy around 7pm. The service was great, they were knowledgable on the dishes and recommend options for vegetarians as well. They filled out water every 15 minutes it seemed like, our water was never empty because of their diligence haha. 

--- Summary ---
Though on the pricey side for a curry dish, I would probably revisit for its great service, decent atmosphere for catching up with friends, and aromatic curry dishes."}
{"text":"My favourite spot for Indian food in the GTA, thus far!
I have tried a good amount of Indian restaurants and Avani certainly tops the list.

The place is always clean and inviting, and their servers are always welcoming and professional.

They do close between lunch and dinner, so make sure to call to make a reservation, always better since they fill up quickly.

They have a window to the bakery/over section, where you'll be sitting on your table, and can see the baker baking those naans fresh into the oven, pretty cool scene!

All their curries and thai dishes are tasty and good
Portions, my all time favourite is the calamari appetizer! I go there just for that sometimes!

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We had the sizzler tofu as a vegetarian starters and not to dampen anyone's spirit it had egg batter on it. That's a no no for Indian vegetarians. When an Indian restaurant prepares Thai food make sure it has all the ingredients of good Thai sauces rather than using coconut milk and a bit of coloring and calling it Thai. We had the Pad Thai and we gave it 5/10 and the Avani Thai curry was basically a coconut creamed based sauce with no hint of Thai in it. It had a many pieces of brocolli and Cauliflower and a few pieces of peppers and carrot. I ask the chef to add tofu and it was basically cut up in triangle pieces and thrown in last minute it was horrible.     I ordered the masala chai and was given a hastily prepared microwaved like tea. How disappointing. Wasting my hard earned money in this pit is a pain. How and why is this place doing business I don't know and I wish them luck only wish they have better chef."}
{"text":"Whenever I would ask someone for a recommendation to a good Indian restaurant, Avani had to be mentioned but for some reason I never really considered visiting. Finally I decided to try it out and was pretty pleased. So apparently this place gets really busy, however I'm assuming we were a bit early, since there were only like 4 tables occupied. Once I entered inside, I immediately could tell that the bill will leave a big dent in my bank account, since based on the decor it looked really fancy. 
Unfortunately, since it was only my brother and I, we couldn't really order that much. I got the baigan bhartha and my brother got something that's really unique- a jackfruit curry. I specifically asked the server to make sure that they use less oil in the my order because I've experienced baigan bhartha's that are drowning in oil from other restaurants. The food arrived within 10ish minutes and were a good serving size. My curry was really flavourful and had some heat to it, which is never a bad thing. The jackfruit curry tasted just like paneer makhani-sans the paneer (obv.). My only complaint would be that my curry was pretty oily despite my request, also as expected, the prices were pretty steep. Apparently the chicken dishes at this place are amazing, which I am keen on trying. So overall, Avani would be a place I would definitely eat at again, but on occasions."}
{"text":"Avani Asian Indian Bistro has a really extensive menu: Indian, Asian (Hakka Indian), Thai. You definitely need to a group if you want to try a few more item on the menu. 

I was lucky enough to dine with a group of yelpers for an UYE and we even has our own private room!

I was able to sample:

Vegetarian Mixed Grill ($24) Makhi Malai Kebab, Tandoori Aloo, Paneer Tikka and juicy Tandoori Mushrooms)
Avani Chicken Sampler ($18) (Sheek kebabs, Afghani Murgh, Chicken Tikka, Chicken Haryali & Reshmi Kebab)
Malai Kofta ($13) House specialty Kofta (dumplings) in a house specialty curry
Goat Curry ($16)
Baingan Bartha ($13) Smoked eggplants roasted in a tandoor oven and cooked into a gravy
Chicken Korma ($14) Boneless chicken breast in a mild cashew curry
Murgh Laziz ($14) Boneless chicken cooked in tomato gravy with ginger garlic 
Saffron Rice ($4.50) Steamed Basmati rice infused with saffron
Roti ($1.99)
Pudina Paratha ($4.99) Specialty Layered Indian Bread made with clarified butter
Kuchumber ($4) Chilled red onions, cucumbers, tomatoes & carrots
Raita ($3.50) Refreshing combination of yogurt, cucumbers, fresh mint and spices

The dish were all well prepared and served at nice hot temperature! We had a lot of fun!

The portion size though a little small at this price point! 

This is one of the rare time I rather going to an Indian restaurant for a buffet experience. Avani does have an Executive lunch buffet at $13.99. I might give it a try next time when I am in the area. Hopefully the food will be as good as my dinner experience!"}
{"text":"Very nice Indian food, and I cannot decide which to order since every dish looks so great. Love the. Utter chicken with garlic Nan here"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. The food is exceptional and absolutely delicious. They had an executive lunch buffet that two people could eat and with two drinks is under $50.
Just went in yesterday for lunch and found out they have discontinued the executive lunch buffet. 

Ordered the similar dishes from the lunch buffet that was discontinued and my bill with tip was $144.00

Holy hell, that's ridiculous

The food is Great don't get me wrong but triple the cost from  previous lunches

The value is now terrible, I love the cuisine and this place but that high of a jump, $$ is absurd and not worth the price jump. Especially for lunch.

Avani u guys have dropped the ball big time. You are pricing everyone out of attending your restaurant"}
{"text":"My partner surprised me by bringing me to Avani. It's our first Indian restaurant together in Mississauga, and I loved the experience. A great start to 2016!!

From the outside, you wouldn't be able to tell how nice the ambiance and decor are set. It's definitely casual for lunch and yes you can bring a date in the evening! 

Happy:  I ordered stuffed naan with kale and sweet potato. It was definitely filling, which I didn't expect. I had aloo gobi (cauliflower and potato curry) to dip my naan which was thick and flavourful. I wish I could cook this dish at home!! My partner had the chicken curry which could have included some veggies and he had it with roomali roti which he was a bit disappointed that it wasn't anything special. 

Not happy:  It's bit pricey for lunch, but it was worth the experience. 

Verdict:  We would definitely go back for special occasions and to bring our friends there. I love how the naan/roti are freshly made."}
{"text":"My first review on yelp...how exciting!

Visited Avani on Sunday and have mixed reviews. 

Service: 5/5 ALL the servers and we had maybe 3 or 4 different ones were amazing. They filled up our water, checked up on us quite often and were incredibly friendly and easy to talk to.

Food: Chili Fried Prawns 5/5; Samosa Rolls 5/5; Tandoori Mixed Grill 4/5 everything was great except the lamb sausage, wasn't too fond of the texture or taste. Butter chicken 4/5, have had better at Sandhi and Bombay Bhel; Chicken Vindaloo 5+/5 best dish of the night, excellent flavour with just the right amount of heat; naan 5/5 warm, crispy lots texture...beautiful; Roomali Roti 3/5 wasn't impressed...recommend you stick to the naan; Chicken Biryani 3/5 was curious about the presentation, was not impressed with the flavour....very bland. Hakka Fried Noodles 4/5 first time trying...it was okay.

Management: 0/5 not sure if reviewers typically review management, but I have to say something. The 2 gentlemen have a lot to learn about customer service and hospitality from their servers. One of them brought us the bill, I asked for the debit machine, he brought it to the table and just stood there while I completed the transaction. Absolutely not ONE word came out of his mouth. What did I expect? How was your dinner? Thank you for coming, I hope we see you again. Absolutely nothing!!!!

And for that, I will not be back. I would rather spend my hard earned dollars at Bombay Bhel or Sindhi."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious. Even though koftas weren't on the menu they made it for me anyways! Food is served quickly and the service is great. Love coming here."}
{"text":"Their Indian Chinese or Pan Asian food options were better than their Indian food, but everything was fresh. It was quite spicy so please remember to indicate your preferred level of spice when ordering. 

Nice ambiance, convenient strip mall location close to the highway, parking lot. Good service."}
{"text":"We ordered veg sampler (upsize) for starters.. It was nice though the quantity really didn't increase that much considering the amount for upsize.. I ordered for a green apple vodka but it was too much diluted..
Main course we ordered was malai kofta and baingan patiala.. Malai kofta was very nice.. Baingan patiala was just fine.. Butter naan could have a little more butter on them.. But all in all this place is much much better for indian food than a lot of other places in toronto!"}
{"text":"This is one of best Indian cuisine for anyone who wants to try it. First time came and preparation was really good. it was little spicy for us since we eat less spicy. but overall food is really hygienic. Tried new hakka delight chicken noodles with great spicy flavours. highly recommend to try it. will come again in future whenever get a chance."}
{"text":"The malabar shrimp is to die for! The roomali roti is superbly soft and fresh. The baingan bharta was delicious. The chai was such a splendid end to a great meal!  Love the food, the ambience and staff. 

A friend and I were catching up after years, over lunch and didn't realize how late it was. We sensed no trace of irritation from the staff. They were as courteous as ever. 

Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Would go back more often if it was closer. One of the best places for butter chicken. Awesome menu. Elegantly decorated. Great friendly service. Definitely would be back!"}
{"text":"Delish Indian food  anytime of the week. The aroma of curry and  tandoor will make your mouth water. One of the good places to grab Indian grub in Sauga City. It's a spacious dining area, good for groups, small or large. 

I recommend the tandoori sampler and the chicken vindaloo. Roomali roti is also very well made here."}
{"text":"I've ordered take-out and dined here before but for some reason I don't have a review for Avani yet...

Today my boyfriend and I decided to have some Indian food for dinner. From the time we arrived until the time we left the servers were very welcoming and friendly. Many other restaurants should get a few pointers from Avani. I also liked how you don't really smell the food coming from the kitchen in the dining area. This means that the smell of food won't cling to your clothes after you leave. The only reason why I didn't give Avani five stars is because of how long it took for our food to come out. It took over 20 minutes for our orders to arrive! There were only three other tables at the time we were ordered.

We ordered a basket of naan (comes with three large pieces), butter chicken, and a full tandoori chicken. The food came out hot and sizzling! The chicken was tender and delicious. The butter chicken was more spicy than the other time we visited. Since I am really bad at handling spices it was REALLY spicy for me. Next time we'll remember to tell them to not include so much spice.

I would definitely recommend Avani for anyone who want to have delicious Indian food. However, it is a bit pricey...about $50 (including tax and tip). We are definitely interested in trying their lunch buffet that apparently blows Tandoori Flame out of the water."}
{"text":"When Torontonians, that know all about good Indian food, recommend a place as one of the top Indian restaurants, you know you are in for a treat!!  This place did not disappoint.  The food was awesome and offers exceptional variety; from traditional North Indian dishes to Hakka dishes and even some Thai!  Wow!!  I was visiting from San Francisco this past weekend and I have to say it has been a long time since I have had scrumptious Indian food.  

We started with Vegetable mixed grill and chilli paneer.  Our main dishes were dal makhni, butter chicken and palak paneer with garlic naan and lachedar parantha.  Everything was delicious but my favorites were the vegetable mixed grill plate and palak paneer.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.  I was told that the roomali roti is a must try but it does take some time to prepare so we decided to skip it.  The service was awesome and the staff was accommodating.  I highly highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. This was my 2nd visit here and again they exceeded expectations. Until next time."}
{"text":"Ok, so the food is actually quite good. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed!! (I would have given this place 2 1/2 Stars if I could. So I rounded up) First, the service was extremely slow and inattentive. This made it difficult to get started (seated and ordered), get refills on my water, and my chai I ordered ended up coming out barely warm (as well as taking a long time to arrive). The other issue I have is with their \"Buffet\". It's not a buffet where you go to a table and pick what you want to try and how much of it you want. I'm actually Very OK with that, it keeps the food fresh and feels more upscale. However, their \"Buffet\" is a preset meal. Honestly, it's really more of a Prix Fixe meal! Now I was told that you can order more of any of the preset dishes, thus being all you can eat (like a buffet), but they give you quite a bit of food and I doubt you'll need to order extra of anything (except the rice, I did need more rice). The problem with this is, you'll probably leave quite a bit of food on the table to go to waste and they Do NOT Let You Take Any With You (remember, it's a \"Buffet\". Only it's really really Not)! This place could easily be a 4 1/2 - 5 Star place! They need to fix their service (biggest issue is really attentiveness) and change their \"Buffet\" to a Prix Fixe menu. As a Prix Fixe menu nothing would really need to change. Don't offer all you can eat (, stay the same price, but Let The Leftovers Go Home With The Customer! There's WAY TOO MUCH food waste in our society!"}
