{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant! I take everyone here when they come to town. The buffet on Saturday for lunch is incredible at a great price! They have the best service and the restaurant is incredibly clean. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love love love the lunch buffet, have been 3 times already and each time has been awesome. Bonus that they bring you fresh naan to the table."}
{"text":"Not bad. Went there for weekend lunch buffet. Long line. Food was only ok, service is like any other average restaurants. Not sure why this place gets such high ratings."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the atmosphere is authentic and cozy. The price is relatively cheap. Family restaurant so the service is great. You can order take out, they give 10% off if you pick it up rather then deliver."}
{"text":"Absolutely love our dinner dates at The Himalayan. The owner and service is wonderful, we're always greeted with warmth and the service is attentive. The food is very flavourful and good value, each curry dish comes with rice, lentil & chick pea salad, and oven baked flat bread. The Mango Fruity and Nepalese Tarkari are our favourite dishes."}
{"text":"One of my all-time city favourites. Perfect for those who don't want the spice of Indian food, but want the flavour and similar dishes. Dining in is a beautiful experience and take-out still gives you the satisfaction of an exotic meal. My favourite is the chili cottage cheese. Sanjay, the owner, is incredibly friendly and will remember you! Try it as an alternative to Indian food."}
{"text":"Great food been going here for a few years, miss the lunch buffet though.   We usually order take out due to our proximity and love the chicken chatpat and chicken chau chau Meow medium spice   Also butter chicken, garlic chicken, and chicken grill is all goods   no idea if i spelled them correctly   Worth checking out - call early or a day before for reservations or be a boss and order take out with a 10% discount"}
{"text":"Love the Momo here......To all Nepalis ....a place to be if you are missing home made food :)"}
{"text":"Good quality and reasonable price. Delightful service. Wasn't too crowded on a Monday evening."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful evening at the Himalayan. The server was extremely knowledgeable about all of the dishes.  The price point was very good for the quality of food. I will continue to go back.  The decor and ambience was very comfortable and intimate."}
{"text":"For those that are a fan for trying different ethnic cuisines that are reasonably priced, then perhaps The Himalayan is a restaurant for you.  Hence it's name, the restaurant serves dishes of Nepalese and Himalayan cuisine.  For those wondering what the heck Nepalese cuisine is, perhaps a quick overview of some geography might help.  The country Nepal is located in South Asia in the Himalayas where it its neighbouring countries are China and India.  As a result both Indian and Chinese cultures have deeply influenced Nepali food where diners will often get an interpretation of the two different cuisines.  Located off of 17th Avenue, The Himalayan offers diners a restaurant of a smallish size, but all-around comfy quarters.  First timers who are going, I definitely recommend booking a reservation because regardless of how small the party is tables are always full in the restaurant.  Despite how packed the restaurant can be, it is not a noisy place where you won't be leaving half-deaf after a dinner.  Therefore, this is a great choice to have for both large or small groups of diners who want to have conversations and not shouting wars across the table.    The menu caters to both meat-lovers and vegetarians where diners can choose from a variety of curry (tarkari), noodle, fusion-style dinners, and plates from the grill.  Nearly all dishes on the menu also include rice and flat-bread with the meal where they are priced at a very reasonable range of $13 to $20.  If you have dined in both Indian and Chinese cuisine, you will immediately notice how Nepalese food had adopted the two cultures and infused them into their food.  Unlike Indian food where its spices can literally kick you in the ass for being so hot, Nepali food adapts its food to being more of a chutney-style.  The infused spices mixed into the food gives diners that wanted spiciness as well as delivering a punch of tangy and sweet flavours all at the same time.  Dining at the Himalayan was a great enjoyment, where dishes were nicely portioned, and the staff was so wonderfully accomodating and warm to their customers.  Overall, I was happy, my wallet was happy, and my tummy was happy to have had a wonderful dinner at the Himalayan.  Dish Recommendations: Jomsom Vegetables  Kathmandu Vegetables Coconut Rice (*** for serious - get the god damn coconut rice, it is freakishly good!!!!)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, atmosphere and service. Would definitely go back anytime! I suggest making a reservation ahead of time!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Excellent!  I cannot say enough good things about this place.  This is my 4th or 5th visit here- I love the Kathmandu veggies.  The atmosphere is comfortable and elegant and the service is polite and courteous. I highly recommend this restaurant if you have not tried it yet- it is one of Calgary's best kept secrets!"}
{"text":"Our first time visiting and certainly not our last. From start to finish, a fantastic dining experience. LOVE this place!!!  The bf and I made reservations for 8pm on a Saturday night, highly recommend making a reso because this place was packed! We were warmly greeted and promptly sat at our table. From the second we walked in the door the smell of the restaurant was intoxicating. We already knew our meals would be delicious.  We were asked if we had been to the restaurant before and were told by our greeter that if we had any questions we could ask our server and he would be happy to help. We were already being treated like gold! So nice! The excellent service didn't stop there. When our server came we ordered drinks and he promptly returned with our drinks and a little snack to start. Nepali chick pea bread with two dipping sauces, one ginger (sweet and spicy) on yogurt (tangy and mild). The yogurt dip was OUT OF THIS WORLD delicious. I licked the serving dish clean. The ginger dip was also very good but the yogurt was the star.  We ordered the pork momo dumplings to start, the bf ordered the chicken grill mild and I ordered the mango fruity shrimp mild. Wow! Wow! Wow! The flavours, my goodness.  Our pork momo dumplings (6) were served with a delicious tomato sauce for dipping. We devoured the dumplings and eagerly awaited our mains. Definitely getting these dumplings again!  The dishes came with perfectly cooked rice, a potato and green pea salad (with nepali spices, yum!) and a basket of grilled bread. The chicken grill also came with a lentil soup. The server mentioned that the grill having no sauce needs a little moisture to enjoy in the best way, so it is to be eaten with the lentil soup to help wash it down. That is not to say the chicken was dry, it wasn't, it was also cooked perfectly. The dish just doesn't come with a sauce as many of the other mains do. The bf loved the chicken grill, though when he tried my mango fruity dish, he continued to dip his chicken in it, it was THAT GOOD!!! :D The mango fruity sauce was so flavourful and amazing as I write this I want it again RIGHT NOW!!! I am a bit sensitive to spice so I ordered it mild, but I'd go for medium next time as it was not spicy at all. Not lacking in flavour though, it was unreal delicious. But would be great with spice also.  We ate everything. Not a piece of food left on either of our plates. We were stuffed, but could not resist when we saw the dessert menu. We both got chyia (unsweetened chai tea served with sugar so you can adjust to taste) and the cassava coconut cake. We also really wanted to try the mango rice pudding, it looked amazing, we will get it next time. There was also a clotted cream pistachio dish that looked incredible. So many excellent choices. The chiya is home made and spiced just right. We finished our chiya and the cake and then rolled out of the restaurant with the biggest smiles on our faces.  Our server chatted with us right until the very end of the meal. He was very professional, friendly, and we can not wait to go back. This place is going to be a new staple."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite lunch buffet in town!  An authentic Nepali restaurant right here in Calgary.  Everything was delicious, I would definitely recommend going.  Note: if you want to go for dinner, make a reservation!"}
{"text":"So, our friends were kind enough to plan a surprise birthday party for us, and they chose the Himalayan. I had been to the Himalayan before for dinner, and liked it. However, when we came for our birthday, they had the buffet menu items available, and ...WOW. Best buffet ever.Yes, EVER. There were enough menu items to choose from, approximately 10 or 12 by my guess, but it was more than enough. This is because when every single dish is excellent, you dont need 40 more to choose from. All I crave now is their food. And at $14 per person, this is excellent value. I'd pay more. The restaurant was packed each time I went, so go early to avoid not being seated in a timely manner, as the place is quite small. The service is always friendly, and the owner is so kind. I spoke with him today when I ordered lunch for our staff, Friday. I told him my budget and he helped me pick a menu, and I was surprised at how many items we can try for what we're paying. Again, excellent value. I will absolutely be visiting this restaurant again and again."}
{"text":"I went for the lunch buffet. I was looking for a place that offered gluten free options and they did (besides the naan bread).   The place looks like it could be a fast food shack from the outside but when you walk in bam! It's looks like fine dining. Even the washroom is beautiful! For 15.50$ for the lunch buffet It is well worth it!  I came alone and sat with my laptop though it does not appear as a cafe but no-one questioned me or gave me funny looks. Amazing. They even had an acoustic Wu Tang song on in the background, how brilliant?  I'll be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"A tasty dinner indeed.  I am a fan of Indian food, but often find it very heavy.  The Nepalese cuisine at The Himalayan I found to have very similar flavor notes, but the food was more delicate.  I left having enjoyed a three course meal without feeling over stuffed. The flavors were delightful, we especially enjoyed the Vegetable Mo Mo dumplings and the grilled Basa fish.  Both full flavored and the fish was spiced very nicely (requested medium-hot).  The Eggplant dish we ordered was also very tasty, with a bit of a chinese flavor to it, surprising and delicious. The establishment was busy on a Sunday night and we were fortunate to acquire a table after only a 20 minute wait.  I will make sure reservations are made when we next visit. The staff were all very friendly and very apologetic that we had to wait."}
{"text":"Food is just amazing. Service is just great. Very busy place. Need reservations."}
{"text":"Best food I had in a long time... Beyond my expectations... Service is friendly and courteous even during the rush hours..   Taste is worth every penny.. You would not be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Wow.  Just wow.  Not only is the food divine, but I'm seriously unsure if I've ever been served by people who care that much about their business.  They have been consistently awesome about being diligent about my allergies and they always inquire very genuinely about our meal.  Love this place!  *a little pricey and portions are a little small, but the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how great the food and service is at this establishment. Very well prepared and unique. The hot is indeed hot! Give it a try if you like spicy food. Peak times require reservations. Very busy and for good reason."}
{"text":"First, I'd like to note that this restaurant underwent a renovation this past summer, and I found that the end result looks really nice, and has a clean & modern, yet tasteful look.  On to the menu, there was a large selection of items, so we asked our server what they recommended. They first asked if we liked spicy food, then proceeded to specifically recommend dishes according to our preferences.   Two people ended up getting platters, or Dal-Bhat as they are called; while the remaining three ordered specific entrees from the menu. Most of the group ordered lamb, and they all agreed it was really good. The spice level we had all requested was spot on for each recipient - it appeared we all enjoyed every bite!  I myself ordered the vegetarian, or cottage cheese, platter & it was so delicious!! The platters came with a rice pudding dessert, which had a mango base & boy was it scrumptous! The portions were just right - we were all stuffed!  All in all, it was a good experience. We give it a 5 out of 5 and we will for sure be dining there again.   Have a great evening everyone."}
{"text":"Well the majority of the previous reviews are bang on.  Awesome food.  Completely out of my normal realm and it was a great surprise.  Service could not of been better.  Had several staff serve us throughout the meal and they all were great.    I found it very affordable for dinner.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So, let's start out with a little context.   Exam: Check.  Absurdly long study sesh: Check.  Broken Spirit: Check.   Hunger due to induced absentmindedness (see points 2 and 3): Check.  Fear not, fellow members of the intelligentsia (and all you other 'schmos' who actually have some clink in the back account). Apparently, such conditions call for the sweet pick-me-up of Nepalese cuisine. And apparently, that dish is set to stun - my mouth that is, with an appropriate but not taste-bud melting amount of delicious spiciness.   Now, shame on me. Why? I was not privy to the decision to order, and therefore merely partook like a surprised and greedy but very satisfied beggar, all the while taking little notice of the actual items being consumed. Review = undermined. Safe to say specificity is not the strong point of this assessment. But hey, there was naan bread.   Nevertheless, the unknown foods were so mouthwatering and the prices so (apparently) reasonable and the man on the phone so (apparently) helpful and the delivery guy (definitely) so friendly that this ridiculously vague review simply needed to be written, and the embryonic legend of the Himalayan propagated to the fullest extent of the interwebz.  So in summary, this place made my pants tight. Because of how full my stomach got. Godspeed."}
{"text":"Have the dinner set, it is awesome. The only detraction is the restaurant feels a little cramped"}
{"text":"Easily the best food I've had in Calgary, i'd recommend the Himalayan Grill and the chatpat. Although I've been trying everything on the menu and everything is better than the last thing I've tried."}
{"text":"What can I say about The Himalayan that others haven't? The restaurant is cute and cozy. We were lucky that we got there at 11:45am for the buffet, because it was really busy when we left at 1pm. The service was excellent, the dishes always cleared and water refilled promptly. There were about 12 (ish) items offered in the buffet, and they were all tasty.  I think Nepalese food is good for those who love the spices but not as much heat used in Indian cooking.  The best part ? The buffet is only $12.50!!!!! Where can you find (good) food for that cheap anymore? Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Great service and food, best indian-like food in the city! (I'm ignorant because I do not know the differnce between indian or nepalese cuisine). it's always full so reservations are a must! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Very nice place with authentic feel, great decor and good ambiance. Service was quick attentive and helpful. The food was very good, fresh and flavorful. Over all a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Well priced ($15) lunch buffet with a modest number of well prepared savoury dishes that run the gamut from vegan to chicken/fish/lamb. Imagine an Indian buffet without cumin or fenugreek. Nice mango rice pudding, sweet couscous and creamy fruit salad for dessert."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Calgary. Good service and great food. The momos and mango shrimp are really good."}
{"text":"Such delicious food. Had the Chili Stir Fry fish. Very flavorful!   I'd easily give this place 5 stars. But it's bit pricey, portions are on the smaller side (esp given the price), and there service not good. They messed up our order (got the wrong type of meat) and then constantly blamed us for it. I was certain we stated \"chili stir fry\" fish, but nope, he was adamant we wanted the chicken. It was really unnecessary and not sure what the server was trying to prove by being so stubborn about it.   I know this place gets really busy so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Amazing food. It was my first time trying Nepalese food and the flavours were outstanding. I have yet to find another dining experience like it. TIP: Have some pepto on hand for afterwards if you are not a regular ethnic food eater."}
{"text":"Great By the way, I ordered chacha and butter chicken. They are sooooo good."}
{"text":"One word: homely!  Everything about this restaurant is homely - the decor, the service and the food.   I went for the lunch buffett alone and ended up sitting in the bar. The decor immediately struck me. I could have easily been sitting in a friend's kitchen and not a commercial establishment because of the warmth of the interior and furnishings.   Service was quick and politely friendly. I've had mixed experiences sitting in a restaurant bar and most times it's that you get a little ignored/overlooked. Not here. The server was very attentive for the duration of my meal.  On to the meal. It was your typical small buffet with around 6 meat based offerings, one rice dish, several vegetable dishes and a couple of dessert offerings. I've never tried Nepali food and was surprised at the similarities with Indian cuisine. Some dishes were hard to figure out because they were not labelled/translated but I still enjoyed everything I tried.   Note: the food described as spicy IS authentic spicy  Loved this little nook. It's a little out of my way but if I'm ever in the area, it's on my go-to list. I'd dock half a star for the inadequacy of the unreserved parking spots but..."}
{"text":"Amazing resto.  Anyone looking for an authentic Nepali food must try their daal Bhaat selection. The Dhaal Bhaat dish also comes with variety of condiments which gives it an extra flavour that isn't comparable  to anything else.  If Anthony Bourdain decides to come to yyc, this will prob be the resto he will visit!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had several dinners and take outs from this restaurant over the last 12 months. Every meal has been fantastic and well priced. I'd highly recommend it to all."}
{"text":"This is, bar none, my favourite restaurant in the city. My girlfriend and I come here frequently for the Daal Bhat, and it is incredible. Whenever we are trying to impress a friend from out of town with food they may not have had before, we will come here. The service is wonderful and pleasant, there is a good selection of beer on tap, and the food is outstanding. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times and the food and service is really good. Tiny restaurant and reservations are best so you better reserve 5 days in advance."}
{"text":"Great decor, phenomenal service and absolutely AMAZING food. Totally unique flavours.  This place is perfect."}
{"text":"Giving The Himalayan a rating of five stars means that it had it all. I can't say there are many restaurants that come close to it.   - phenomenal flavours - unique dishes - nice atmosphere - superb service  Probably my favourite restaurant experience in Calgary."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a GEM! The owner is so welcoming and pays great attention to detail. The food is out of this world. Authentic and truly an epicurean expedition to far away lands. This restaurant  came highly recommended and has never disappointed us."}
{"text":"Well got dragged here again . The food quality here is very good . Couple of complaints mind you  today at the lunch buffet the temp in the restaurant was sweltering once I was all sweaty I downloaded a app to check the temp and it was 34 deg c . Tho I think they just turned on the ac because it started to cool rapidly. Now for the gross part , some knuckle dragger in a suit went up to the buffet line with a dirty plate the waitress attemp5ed to stop him and get him to use a clean one  but he declined . I know she was trying to be polite but this is one instance where the customer is not right . All in all decent food ."}
{"text":"This place was so so good! We had veggie momos, the lamb appie, the basafish and traditional chicken plate. Our servers were very attentive a the food was incredible! We will definately be back!! Great first time experience"}
{"text":"Returned here with my friends for my birthday dinner. The place looks great after the renos, it's more open and bright. We were lucky we made a reservation, as many people were waiting at the door for a table. I tried the Garlic Chicken this time, and it was fabulous. We also got Chicken mo:mos to start, and unfortunately they brought veggie ones instead. We brought this to the server's attention, and she was extremely apologetic. The manager (I think he's also the owner) came by and was really great about the whole thing, and even let us keep the veggie mo:mos. Both the veggie and chicken mo:mos were excellent. My love affair with the Himalayan is one that won't be broken anytime soon, that's for sure! Wonderful food and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Was a long time regular but stopped going for a while. Ate there last weekend and again realize while The Himalayan is the one regular restaurant that never disappoints. Sanjay was happy to see us, service was great, food tasty and well priced. Will be back again before too long."}
{"text":"We read the reviews and came in with high expectations. Expectations = met. We ordered the pork Mo Mo, Himalayan lamb grill and a vegetarian dish (spinach w/ potato and tofu recommended by our server).   All three dishes were excellent and more than enough food for two. The flavours are unique which was such a nice change. It felt like every dish was prepared with care, our lamb was excellent.   We scored a parking spot right out front, but the parking lot is a bit of a pain so I would say street parking is easier. The place seats many, but provides your party with space. Completely non-pretentious. Server was great. Price is super reasonable. Would for sure go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot. Food is especially flavourful and the ambiance is friendly and calm. After a few visits they know you by name. The food is spicy, but not too hot. Lamb is fantastic. Only reason I hesitate to recommend is that it will become too popular and hard to get a reservation."}
{"text":"My favourite place to go when unsure of what to eat!  I have never, ever been disappointed with anything from this restaurant, and I want to recommend EVERYTHING! The most delicous, soft and supple naan I have ever had. I often fantasize about the naan.   The service is really great too!  I have recommended all my friends to this restaurant, and all of them love it!"}
{"text":"I have been back to Himalayan a few times since my last review, and I am happy to see that some of my initial negative impressions have been addressed by the management. The size of the portions is now decent and commensurate well to the pricing. Also notably, the service is always courteous and attentive, and considering that the restaurant is always busy, the staff does an outstanding job to keep their customers coming back."}
{"text":"I was at Calgary for a week and tried several nice restaurants including steakhouses, fancy mexican, and japanese. And I think Himalayan by far is my favorite, the food is very good and comforting. Will be coming back for sure every time I visit Calgary. :D"}
{"text":"No mention of reservations at all. Made us look like idiots because we didn't reserve."}
{"text":"We had food delivered from here - I really wish they were on Skip the Dishes or Uber Eats - it was not the easiest to order. But the food was SO GOOD. Everything is so flavourful and delicious. They have great veggie options too. A bit on the spendy side - we paid $100 for three people and could have eaten more. But great food for a splurge. I'd like to eat in the restaurant next time for that price."}
{"text":"We went to this place after reading the stellar yelp reviews and the many mentions of the care they take in preparing food for celiacs.  We were not disappointed, the food was generally excellent, with all 5 of us being very impressed with our mains.  I went with the vegetarian Dal Bhat, which I only got about half way through (it was huge and very tasty, though the dal was a bit bland).  The mango rice pudding and chai (which wasn't too cinnamon-ie) were both fantastic.    The service was excellent, with the staff being very careful to mention which items had wheat in them.    My only real complaint was with the momos - we went with the pork momos but even flavorful pork could't elevate these.  I know momos aren't supposed to be popping with flavor, but I think the herb/meat/aromatic mixture stands to be optimized.    All in all, you should definitely check out The Himalayan."}
{"text":"Let me start with service which was amazing! Roopa was our server.  Very attentive. We had himaliyan Lamb and fish stir fry. Both excellent l. Ambiance is very relaxing. Our first stop in Calgary food wise. I'll definitely bring my friends here."}
{"text":"Great food and service, the owner/manager was very friendly and made sure we felt welcome"}
{"text":"Best Buffet in town. Hands down blows away any Indian style buffet in town. The Dishes are unique and very energizing. Worth every pennie !! Will always find a way to fill my soul with good food from here !!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place for lunch buffet couple of times but, tonight I happen to enjoy  the dining experience. When me and my friend entered this restaurant they made us fell like it's our home. Excellent service, excellent food and excellent ambiance.   They have gluten free, allergies free food and good amount of vegetarian options, you will not be disappointed. We ordered momos for  apps, they are melt in your mouth goodness it came with mild and hot sauce but, I totally skipped the sauce for last couple of pork  momos, every bite lead me closer to heaven and craving for more. For our next course, we ordered lamb dhal bhat (traditional Nepalese platter) and himalayan shrimp. If you are really hungry order the dhal bhat it comes with sweet dhal, tomato and spinach side, saffron basmathi rice wonderfully cooked, green salad, raitha, pickles, flat bread (naan) , hot beverage of your choice and mango rice pudding which is still lingering in my taste buds. Lamb is quiet a tough meat to cook, I don't have any clue what himalayan voodoo they have done,  it literally melted like butter in my mouth. The shrimp was splendid which came with the awesome saffron rice and green salad. For drinks we had a bottle of wine but, I would suggest good tiger beer that will go well with most south asian food.   To summarize, these guys are one among the best places in Calgary to dine. They will make your tummy and your heart happy. Quiet a gem in this city.  P.S: Kindly forgive me if there are any grammatical or spelling mistakes English is not my first language."}
{"text":"This place has the best balance of South Asian food with less cream. Everything here is absolutely tasty. I highly recommend you try the Ginger Chicken. It's like Butter Chicken on crack, I kid you not! The Mango Fruity is a huge favourite of mine. Start all that off with the grilled paneer and end it off with a Chai Tea!  Sanjay the owner is so friendly and is very appreciable of his customers every time they come and he works hard to make sure you have an amazing experience every time you come in."}
{"text":"My friend chose this restaurant for her birthday dinner in Feb and it was such an excellent choice! The service was excellent, and the server offered some suggestions on dishes. All the food was delicious. My friend doesn't really like meat much but she really liked both the chicken and lamb dishes we got. Everything we saw looked delicious, so we definitely return. This place is small but very busy. Even with our reservation we waited almost 30 minutes for our table."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has a few food allergies and they were VERY helpful with what he could/could not eat. The waiter was very nice and quite funny and gave us amazing recommendations.  Food was great, tasty, fast and fairly cheap.  4 stars only because the parking lot and restaurants are VERY small. Carpool and make reservations!  I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Hidden GEM! I've been to this place over a dozen times and never ever disappointed-  You'll only be disappointed if you don't make a reservation because yes they are that busy even during the week .  I have had 5 star meals everytime and the family owners are always kind and overly attentive . Nothing is lacking here ! You will be very pleased .  See you soon Himalayan! Xo"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with excellent food! The very recent renos have brightened up the place! Well done! Food and service are both extremely good. Open your mind and mouth for something a little different you won't regret it. Appys I recommend are the Chicken MoMo's and the Fish Tareko. As far as main courses go the Dal-Baht is my favorite but the Himalayan Grill is a very good option. Don't be afraid to get a couple different dishes and share around with some friends. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Pricing is a little high for the quantity of food. We do always feel rushed as there are people waiting. They could surely expand and still be extremely busy."}
{"text":"Located in Shaganappi Plaza one wouldn't think of much of the Himalayan from the outside. It looks like a normal plaza restaurant; namely, plain, boring and might have the atmosphere of an office waiting room. However, fortunately this isn't the case. Inside you are whisked away into an intimate dinning atmosphere that feels somewhat Indian-esque. Pictures of the Hymalayan mountains line the walls, servers are mostly Napalese and the smells of wonderful spices fill the air. I am instantly at ease!  For a starter, they offer you lentil flour bread along with yogurt and spinach dipping sauce. Delicious! The bread was chip-like in texture, but felt much cleaner and less oily than say tortilla chips. Dinner featured an appetizer of Chicken Choyla Bala ($6.75) followed by Chicken Spinich Tarkari ($15.45) and Himalayan Shrimp ($17.25).   All dishes left me breathless. It was like discovering a new colour for the first time. Such new flavours from spices I've never encountered before. I felt a sense of wonder and excitement with every bite. Another thing that impressed me was how clean and neat all the dishes were. For example, the sauces were naturally thick without feeling like the restaurant just added flour to it.   I had a wonderful experience at the Himalayan, I felt like my tongue grew as a person that night! I would highly recommend you try this place if you are looking for something that is ethnic, different, fun and just plain good! Great place to take a date!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. It made me rather horny. The butter chicken was to die for"}
{"text":"Soooo good!  Food is exquisite, and the service is some of the friendliest I have ever had.  Get the momo's to start :). You need to go here."}
{"text":"Fan-freaking-tastic!  Pork momos and chicken chatpat. Beautifully spiced, extremely flavourful and filling."}
{"text":"You Yelpers didn't lie to me about this restaurant, all 55 reviews are all 4 or 5 stars nothing 3 stars or less.   The food was AMAZING! Since this is my initial visit to the restaurant; I ordered Dhal Bhat, it's like a set dinner course comes with: Spinach Tarkari, Chicken or Lamb Chatpat, Jhaneko Dal (Lentil Soup), Saffron Rice, House Salad with house yogurt dressing, house made picked cabbage and carrots plus house made sauce and yogurt as dipping sauce. Most importantly it's also serves with flat bread, mango rice pudding dessert and Coffee or Tea. Since I'm not a spicy food person, I ordered mild spicy level. But the spiciness was perfect for me. The Spinach Tarkari was tangy creamy it well mix with flat bread or rice. Oh the FLAT BREAD.... It was soft and heated by clay oven brushed with oil or butter...... anyways it was good paring with all the food above the list. And the final dessert...... the BEST mango rice pudding I had, the mango sauce was mix with coconut milk plus some kind of cinnamon, or ginger kind of spice. I'm maybe taste little nutty flavour too... guessing it could be nutmeg, either way it was good. My friend ordered Grill Lamb, clay oven grill lamb serve on hot sizzling plate with green peppers, onions and tomatoes. Serves with vegetarian Chatpat, saffron rice and house salad with house dressing. The lamb was well marinated in their house Nepali herbs and spices recipe.   The food was delicious, and the services; I need to give them 5 star plus additional bonus points if I could. We came in 15 minutes before closing and they still serve us. Plus that the water they keep refilling, until I realized they infused with fresh cut cucumbers inside the water pitcher. Compare with fresh lemon waters, I found cucumbers taste elegant smooth with spicy food, it really can reduce the spiciness. And not acidic as lemon waters.   Overall, another BEST restaurant in cow-town. I'll definitely be back to try their lunch buffets."}
{"text":"This place was super busy on a Saturday night. That being said, we strolled in around 7:30pm and only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. The host wanted to make sure we weren't upset by a long wait, so he originally estimated the wait at 30 minutes to mentally prepare us. But then a spot opened at the bar, so we swooped right in.  Given how packed the tables are, it might be best to sit at the bar. That felt like the only place where your arms weren't pinned to your sides, and your eating surface had plenty of space as well.  Per Yelp recommendations, we had the pork momos and lamb dal-bhat. Per the restaurant recommendation, we also had the Nepalese tarkari. The spices in the pork were amazing! I loved the tomato dipping sauce the momos came in as well, and probably would've licked that dish clean if were weren't sitting next to the waiting area crowds.  The dal-bhat is almost like a lunch combo, but for dinner. I went with it just cause it allowed me to sample several things in smaller portions. The lamb could've been softer and might be a little tough for some people, but I ate all of it so it obviously wasn't that bad. My husband loved the sauce and kept dipping the bread in the bowl until he was too full to finish his own entree. The lentil soup was really good, not just cause it's cold outside but because it's amazing. Nothing bland nor flat about it. The saag tasted like the Nepalese tarkari but without potatoes.   The tarkari can be vegetarian-friendly or with meat. We chose veggies just to try and be healthy. It's so yummy, and the rice is bomb-diggity too. My husband ended up eating all the rice before he could finish the tarkari.  Both dishes came with a side of what can only be described as potato salad. However, this ain't your traditional recipe. No idea what spices and sauce was used, but the cold potatoes were a nice contrast to the warm dishes.  The dal-bhat also came with mango rice pudding and a choice of tea or coffee. Since it was late, we had the tea. It was actually more like chai, and really soothing after such a meal. Although we were full, we had no trouble polishing off that rice pudding.   I wish they had something like this back home!!!"}
{"text":"It was on a date night that we stumbled on this Resto since I decided to try something with a rice dish and it didn't fail to amaze us. Staff were very attentive and courteous, and knowledgeable on the menus since we're new to it all. I can say I loved all our orders but I can't forget how uniquely delish the naan bread/biscuit is. I'm sure they all did these so it's a food of comfort, tight space but worth the experience. If I remember it right I had the chat pat and hubby the Himalayan grill on lamb. We also tried their vegetable momo and I can say they're all  up to the dessert. A definite MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"I was told by clients this is super awesome. Came with very high expectations. No parking what so ever. Food was not bad."}
{"text":"Been coming here regularly over the last few years and the food consistency and service is always amazing. The prices are reasonable at ~$18 a plate and the ambiance is great for family get togethers or date nights. I would recommend making a reservation as the place is always packed. But take out is always a great option as well. My go to dishes are the Himalayan Grill, Mango Fruity (It's not on the menu but instead of chicken or shrimp I ask for the lamb) and most importantly sub garlic pita bread instead of plain."}
{"text":"Overall amazing! Great food, slightly on the more expensive side, but worth it!   NOTE: Make sure to call to make reservations! They do have two open tables from 1700-1730 that don't require a reservation, but otherwise they are flat out booked for the rest of the night.   Great place, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Places like Himalayan do not need a review; strongly holding the #2 spot among all of Calgary restaurants with their gourmet food, amazing ambiance and cordial service. The place was simply packed on Saturday night, the staff was on their toes and the owner was personally greeting the guests and apologizing for wait time. About the food - what can I say, the best momos I have ever eaten, absolutely melt in the mouth and steamed to perfection. Momos are very labor intensive, most places that make them don't offer vegetarian options and either under or over cook them. We also ordered their Paneer chili entrée and Chau Chau noodles. The noodles were great, probably the best fired tofu I have had in there. The chili paneer was average at best, I was not a big fan of their naan, rice or nepali salad. I was expecting higher prices given the ambiance and hype, but to my surprise, very reasonable (compared to US). 8 momos just for CA$7. Entrees were CA$15-16 but came with rice, naan and salad."}
{"text":"Really great lunch buffet. There is a lot of selection and the food is good quality for the price. Very flavourful,  got good service. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is someone's interpretation of an asian cuisine for Caucasian yuppies, and good for them, I hope they make a lot of money selling this food to people. People on expensive dates, people who have parents visiting them from back home and would like to try a restaurant that is tolerably exotic and people who \"love to try new types of food,\" this place would be great for all the above experience.   The food did not satisfy my hunger, I did not think that all of it was worth eating and the service was mediocre. My plate was neatly divided into 3 sections, protein, starch and vegetable, I am not sure if this is the traditional Nepalis way of presenting dinner, but am sure many of the guests at this restaurant appreciated the clear and comprehensible distinction.   The desert was a grand disappointment and did nothin to salvage the meal for me."}
{"text":"Indeed, this place is as good as it is difficult to get a reservation to eat there!! All that I have to say is that, when I ordered a thali, both me and my husband kept reaching for the spinach curry even though we ordered chicken and lamb dishes as well. If spinach could be made so good, you can guess the food standards! Besides the thali, the must trys here are the chilli chicken and the mind blowing chicken MOMOS :D"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Calgary. Beautiful and peaceful setting with absolutely delicious food and excellent service."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I came here with high expectations, but found it to be just okay. Maybe my standard for Indian/Nepalese/Bengali/Pakistani food is higher than everyone else's, but it is what it is.   The lunch buffet is not too extensive, which is fine. The flavours were a bit foreign to me. It looks like Indian food, but doesnt taste exactly like it. Not better, not worse.. Just different. I remember eating the daal and telling the hubster that \"ha ha, our daal is SO MUCH BETTER!\", to which he chuckled and nodded an obligatory \"yes\".  It's not a bad place by any means. Clean, well-decorated, nice servers. I can see why a lot of people enjoy it and continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service and reasonably priced! Double date night and I wanted to try something different and this place meets the mark. Being a gentleman of low standing, I'm always suspicious of restaurants that require reservations due to fact that I'm poor, and places like these usually require big chunks of my paycheck. Not here! Very affordable and very delicious. I recommend the mango fruity, if you're not sure about what to get, bring an adventurous soul with you, so you can steal sneaky taste tests if their lamb . Parking sucks but the foods more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Very quaint clean nice staff nice owner good food will recommend always Limited on parking but still an overall great experience to go to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Foods are perfect and delicious but the restaurant is so small & has a parking problem. Strongly recommend it but you should book it earlier."}
{"text":"How do I love they, let me count the ways!  You may ask yourself what occasion calls for the Himalayan. I highly recommend birthdays, anniversaries, celebrations, dates, catching up with friends, or just being hungry. This is a popular place with very good reason so always make a reservation.  The food is tops in both quality and flavour and the portions are just right too. We have had several items off the menu over a couple of visits and the real problem we have is that they are all so good it is hard to try something new.   Definitely don't skip the appetizers as the Mo:Mo's and fish tareko are on the top of the list of favourite dishes here. We generally argue about which one to get, and then get both.  Make a reservation and go. Then tell everyone else you know to do the same. Love this place and want to keep them in business as long as I am around to eat there. Yum!"}
{"text":"Really love this place.Great food for a great price. It's so nice and clean inside and the service is great. Been there for dinner once and had to go back for the lunch buffet. Both times I had a great experience. The momo's are my favourite, which are a vegetable dumpling kind of thing.."}
{"text":"Update: we've been to The Himalayan multiple times and I'm happy to report that the food, atmosphere and service are still outstanding! Make reservations as this is one very busy place for obvious reasons!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant and the service is wonderful- the lunch buffet is outstandingly good!!  Would go back again and again!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Calgary! Amazing new renovation. Superb service. The best dishes both meat and vegetarian. A+++++++"}
{"text":"Our party of six was seated pretty promptly for a reservation made in advance even though the place was busy and packed! Our server was pretty quick and friendly and the service throughout the night was good. I ordered this platter on the menu that included a lamb curry, lentil soup, rice and some sides, all very delicious. However the highlight was definitely the coconut naan bread.#$&##* that was so good. Definitely order that to try when you go! Garlic naan was alright too.   Price was a little bit on the high side for what your eating, this was dinner I suppose. If the portions where a tiny bigger or price came down it would receive the place perfect five star from me.   Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Reservations are a must, been here so many times. The food is very consistent and I've been here over 20 times in the last year. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Come here to eat, you will love it!."}
{"text":"Very good food and they accommodated a substitute to keep an eye on it being too spicy for my companion with a smile. Friendly service and the dishes we had reminded me of Indian food, but I'm trying one of the sizzling plate next time!"}
{"text":"Every time I've come to the Himalayan I've not been disappointed. As crazy and busy as it seems to always be, I've never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table. They are also great at handling reservations for large parties, but do ask that you order in advance to streamline the process.    The menu offers an array of plates,  including vegetarian options, without becoming too long or cumbersome to navigate. Patient and knowledgeable waitstaff is another of the Himalayan's great assets. They are happy to further offer food or liquor recommendations if you're not sure what to get. The only minor complaint I have is while you can order dishes with varying spiciness, some are much milder than others.   As for the space, their sleek, warm decor is welcoming and romantic. With a mixture of dark wood wall inserts, unique light set ups and a luxurious bar, this place is truly dazzling. Definitely a great date-night spot if you're looking to try something new!"}
{"text":"After all these years we finally took in The Himalayan. We mad a reservation for early Tuesday evening (5:30 pm), and the restaurant was full (all reservations) in no time at all. And I must say I'm so glad we finally went to this lovely and delicious restaurant. It's located in a crappy little strip plaza, and the outside is nothing to write home about. But inside ... OMG, what a beautiful place! You would never know from the outside. What a delightful surprise. And the ambience is awesome.  We were served by a very nice and polite young man who clearly knew his menu and the ingredients. Polite, friendly, and knowledgeable. A pleasure to be served by him.  We started with a shared appetizer, the \"Vegetable Mo:Mo\"; 6 beautifully artistically created steamed dumplings filled with veggies, mozzarella cheese and herbs & spices. Absolutely delicious, with perfect texture, layered with flavours and delightfully light. Right away, I was more than happy.  Linda had the \"Mango Chicken Fruity\", which is creamy mango, beautiful white chicken pieces, in a tomato and cashew nut sauce. She ordered it \"medium\" spiced. She loved it. I tried some and it was as nice as I have every tasted. Perhaps the best ever.  I had the \"Machha ko Johl\", which is a nice light basa fish cooked a tomato, onion and mustard-based sauce. OMG, this was good! I've had this dish several times in Thai restaurants, but this Himalayan version beats them all. I was more than impressed by the layers of flavour, and how the sauce brought the fish to life. I ordered it \"mild\" spiced. I would definitely have it again. And again.  These dishes came with saffron rice, which was perfectly done and worked very well. It also came with a Nepali Salad, which was really a different type of cold potato salad. I didn't think this worked as well, and thought the vinegar was a bit forward. However, everything else was so perfect, this did not affect my opinion overall; which is, You have to eat here!   This is one of the finest restaurants in Calgary, without a doubt. We will definitely be back often to try the many other interesting items on their menu. And, yes, even the price was right. It's so delightful to see restaurants like this in Calgary.  Service: 5/5. Presentation: 5/5. Ambience: 5/5. Portion Size: 5/5. Flavors: 5/5. Parking: 3/5. Value: 5/5."}
{"text":"So delicious! Had a group of six, we had made reservations good thing we did it was packed but they were so lovely and prompt. Had lamb Dahl bah, absolutely delicious. So much flavor and I was a little concerned about the portion size but a little goes a *long* way."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful dining experience! It was a friend's birthday dinner that brought us here, and my friend is known for picking wonderful ethnic food, and this was one of those times.   Super cute inside, very traditional, it's Nepal food. First thing that made my day, was the used a G next to the items that were gluten free. Saves me the time of asking, and both of us the frustration of something going wrong.   The food was outstanding! The hubs and I shared 2 starters, a veggie crepe (made with lentils, not flour), lamb, and veggie chatpat. It was all delicious and perfect potion sizes.   The service was awesome, especially seeing as there was about 20 of us. They were friendly, the food was timely, nothing was cold or screwed up.   The best part of the meal was getting the bill. Dutch and I shared a half litre of wine, two starters and an entree and our was with auto grat was $46. Amazing!   This wold also be a great spot for vegetarians, lots of options."}
{"text":"Just recently renovated, this 'new' version has added at least 1/3 more seats and will likely have shorter line-ups nor have to turn away customers without reservations. The Nepalese staff are well-informed and super helpful. The decor is quite appealing with enough stuffed furniture and wall paintings to depict the Himalayas and other Nepali cultural features.  As first-comers, we tried the chicken-del platter and one of the authentic fish dishes, and were quite taken by the spice combinations and intersecting flavours that were quite wonderful. Next time we ordered a singular non-platter chicken dish, a veggie dish and the same fish. All in all, what a treat! As a foodie and as knowing a few other great restaurants in town, we had a measuring stick a la palate, price and quantity to go by (eg. Raj Palace south Indian food on Harvest Hills/Country Hills area near the T&T chinese supermarket, and Bon-ga Korean house in China Town), and found The Himalayan close to their standards. Would we return?  We did a few times, and slowly came to the realization that the spices were less to our liking than our original take, and that the portions tend to be on the small side.  Do not stay away, however, but check it our for yourself. As its flavours are milder than southern Indian, for instance, perhaps it will likely be added to your list of restaurants of choice any day of the week."}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary for a conference and this place was within walking distance of our Airbnb. We were blown away by the friendly service and the incredible food, so much so that we came back again the next night."}
{"text":"My experience at the Himalayan was an exceptional one, not only because of the taste and service per se, but for the tranquil, almost soothing, rhapsody that is played throughout the dining experience. I would liken it to meditating at a waterfall, or the relief after a yoga session--in the sense that it felt spiritually and emotionally satisfying.  The music created an atmosphere of warmth, peace and set the tone of the experience  I started with the Momos as an appetizer.(Recommended by many people) The freshly prepared, handmade Momos had a chewy texture, full of meat and spices, and each complimented their own counterparts. (The plate was emptied before I could take a picture)  For the main, I had the Himalayan Grill option with chicken. Perfectly seasoned chicken, yet succulent and juicy at the same time. (how do you do that?) The veggies and rice also orchestrated in the background, emphasizing the forte of the flavours.  In the end, all I can say is: The Himalayan is worth the reservation in advance, the hassle of parking and the fact that it is open 4-5hrs daily. It gives that balance of flavours, service, personal and spiritual satisfaction that leaves you lost in another world."}
{"text":"This place is now on our \"go to\" list. We've actually been a few times already. Friends took us there saying it was great and it was! I had the Fruity Mango Shrimp with naan bread and that knocked it out of the park! The Chau Chau is also good. Tried both the meat and the vegetarian Momo's....go for the vegetarian ones. The meat ones were kind of bland. Pappadum sauces were delicious and a great add. For dessert, the mango rice pudding is unique in flavour and delicious. Service....EXCELLENT! Fantastic staff. Attentive, fast, polite and readily available. Really nice people and last visit we found out they were expanding. Until they do, book more than a week in advance for a table on the weekend or you won't get in."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars lightly, but Sanjay and his Himalayan restaurant deserve it. To say the food is a little like indian food doesn't do it justice. The spices are more subtle and nuanced, and there's plenty of dishes you cannot find anywhere else. Service is top notch, and the staff are both knowledgeable and attentive. I've been coming here since it opened, and I have pretty much eaten my way through the entire menu. I find it safe to say there is not a single bad dish on the menu.   If you are of a vegetarian bent, go for the Nepalese Tarkari, get an order of garlic bread to go with."}
{"text":"Love this little restaurant. Food, attitude and atmosphere are excellent. Parking leaves a lot to be desired. Spaces are almost wide enough to park a bike, not a car, but once you get inside the buffet is worth it."}
{"text":"Mostly people already wrote these foods reviews so I tell you their chai tea is sooo good!!and coconut nann is fabulous!!we've been there every monthly our anniversary everytime they are busy. Recommend make an reservation!!"}
{"text":"Tried the buffet, interesting dishes only 1 medium spicy (and labeled as such), food was nice, probably authenticbut a little cold  Otherwise moving to the 5th star"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff. Took off a star because they no longer offer the lunch buffet which is what hooked me in the first place.  I don't enjoy it as much without the variety of the buffet."}
{"text":"I have no clue how and why this restaurant acquired so many good reviews. I had high expectations for this restaurant and wanted to try the popular lunch buffet lunch. So, I literally starved all morning, so I could enjoy their buffet.  I was very impressed with the decor - very warm and welcoming. We got seated immediately and went straight to the buffet spread. The spread itself is small - they have rice, naan, dhaal, a few other appetizers, noodles, veggie curry, lamb curry, beef curry and butter chicken. I tried everything on the menu and nothing really stood out. The dishes were not spicy at all, and worst of all, there was too less salt in the dishes. Bland, bland, bland.  The butter chicken was the better of all the curries, so I ended up eating just that with naan. Extremely disappointing!"}
{"text":"Food, service, authenticity, value. The Himalayan absolutely kills it across the board.  What are you doing right now? As long as no one's life hangs in the balance, stop what you're doing immediately and eat at The Himalayan.   Lunch time? Yup. Dinner? Certainly. Date night? You betcha.   The Himalayan is a flavour paradise that you can go to for any occasion.   I've heard plenty of people rave about the food, but I never realized how nice the place is. It seems that once most people start eating, the food takes over and they can't remember anything else about the experience. I'd like to say I'm different and paint a pretty picture of this building with my words, but as soon as that spice fire curry (not actually called that) hit my lips, all I remember is one intense foodgasm.   It's a little fancy but not uncomfortably so. It's a small place, but works well if you want to do a dinner with a group of friends. I remember really liking the artwork. What was it? Can't remember. Foodgasm.   They're popular, so make sure you book in advance.  The service is completely lovely. They make your evening special and you feel good about spending your money. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times now and have always had an exceptional meal and exceptional service. The food is fresh and well prepared. Much more subtle and complex flavours than restaurants from similar regions (i.e. mediocre Indian). The owner is always onhand and offers that extra bit of service, always recognizing returning customers. There are little touches to meals, service and preparation that other restaurants ignore.  It is nice to have a restaurant that is not bland on the west side of the city, and that is not afraid of \"flavour\" offending the western palate. I could eat here every week.  *Note that I have just downgraded this restaurant one point. The last two times I was in, I ordered my favourite appetizer, the Vegetable Momo, and it was very disappointing. The flavour is still good, but it seems like they are taking shortcuts and not preparing it fresh. Both times it was oddly lukewarm (with an uneven temperature) almost like it was badly heated in a microwave. Very strange. Please go back to what you were doing! Luckily the main courses were still excellent."}
{"text":"One of my favorites.  The best soft noodles.  A little pricey but worth it.     If you haven't had Nepalese food before, you need to try it out.  Absolutely yummy!! And an intimate and romantic atmosphere.  Very attentive and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant  three times and never been disappointed with the service and efficiency. From my experience we got one of the best service from this place. They were constantly busy and had line up but did not neglect any of their customers the whole time we were their. Decoration is gorgeous with landscape picture from Nepal and Buddha statue. Menu has lot of good options. While you wait for your order to arrive , they serve complimentary papadam on the table. I think that is a very nice gesture to customers. Their momo ( Nepalese Dumpling) is a must try. We always tried the chicken one and they melt in your mouth. Their dal-bhat plate is a big plate with lots of food. So if you are really hungry then get it. My most favorite dish was their chow chow, nepalese noodles with lots of veggies and shrimps. Highly recommended restaurant."}
{"text":"Sanjay  and his crew deserve nothing but the highest of praise. This is easily the best service i have ever had in an ethnic restaurant, and the prices are flat out bonkers for this quality of food.   The food. Oh, the food. The food is superb; delicate and nuanced, it delivers like no other has before. This is easily my favorite restaurant of all time. Double the price and i would still think so. That is not an exaggeration.   I wrote this review with a sole purpose: First timers! Get the freaking vegetarian dal bhat. Just do it. Forget your meat fetish and save $5 on the best version. This dish gives you tons of variety and comes with dessert and tea (both incredible). It's a great starting point and includes my 3 favourite things on the menu.  Go there. Order Dal Bhat. Profit."}
{"text":"Loooove the noodle dishes here & the naan! I would go back just to get the noodles again and of course to try the other dishes. Too bad it's under renovation currently.. :("}
{"text":"To me Nepali cuisine is mostly Indian with some Chinese influence here and there. Mo:Mos are reminiscent of potstickers and in fact look like the potstickers my mum used to make but instead of vinegar and ginger they are served up with a spicy yogurt sauce. The food tends on the mild side and flavours are not as intense as true Indian cuisine. I've been to Himalayan twice and both times the food was great. The Dal-Bhat, a traditional Nepali plate is an excellent value and a great way of trying Nepali food; the main (Cottage cheese for non-meat version or a choice of lamb or chicken) is served with Dal (Lentil Soup), Bhat (Saffron Rice), Saag (Spinach in creamy sauce), Flat Bread (Buttered) and a traditional Nepali Side, pickled carrot and cabbage and Nepali style tomato sauce. Included is Tea or Coffee and Mango Rice Pudding. All this for $23. This time around I started with pork mo-mos. The wrapper of the mo-mos were a perfect texture. The filling could have had more flavour, it was basically pork with curry and was a bit too dense for my liking. The sauce needed jazzing up and the mo-mo and sauce came together well once I had a spicier version of the sauce brought to me. I had the Himalayan for my main which is roasted lamb or shrimp in a creamy tomato, red wine and cashew nut based sauce. This is served with naan and saffron rice and a traditional Nepali side. I chose lamb and the pieces of lamb were soft but could have been a little more tender. This is a mild dish but can be spiced up by telling your server you want it hot. The flavour of the tomato sauce was good but I couldn't determine what spices were used. It was very creamy from the cashews and not dairy. Saffron rice is perfectly cooked and the naan nice and fresh. Sanjay is a model of efficient and great service. He should start a school for servers; he's totally aware of what is happening in his restaurant and remembers detail. As soon as he found out that I loved spicy food, offered to make sure that my main dish was spiced up. The ambience is elegant and soothing. The parking lot is small as the location is a strip mall with 5-6 businesses all sharing the lot. Reservations are definitely recommended as it is a small place."}
{"text":"Best dining experience I've had in the city so far.  The service staff were amazing, the dining area is very well laid out, the atmosphere was very relaxing, and the food was absolutely delicious.  My only complaint would be the lack of parking, but we managed to get a spot for our reservation with no problems."}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience. Service and cuisine were far beyond what I expected when I saw the humble exterior.   The bottomless chai tea cup is a delicious compliment to the meal."}
{"text":"Good service, strong flavor, reasonable price.  I had the grilled fish with medium spiciness (apparently that means 1 jalapeno worth of heat, whatever that means) and it was excellent. I recommend going with the coconut flat bread as it balances out the heat a little bit.   There was actually quite a bit of food and I left the place feeling very satisfied."}
{"text":"Drum roll...  Finally, here's my lunch buffet review:  the boys and I were here on a Sunday afternoon and we were thankful that we made reservations.  The restaurant was packed with hungry diners!   Kudos to the kitchen staff, servers and Sanjay for their impeccable service and efficiency (the buffet was constantly being filled with fresh food).   The buffet offerings this time were: pappadums, saffron rice, Machhako Jhol (tender morsels of fried basa in a perfectly spiced tomato and onion based mustard sauce), mushrooms and peas, Kathmandu vegetables (cauliflower, chickpeas and potatoes), Chau Chau (flour noodles stir-fried with cabbage, carrots, peppers and soy sauce), Jheneko Dal (lentils), Lamb with daikon (a mildly spiced and delicious lamb stew), butter chicken (melt-in-your-mouth boneless chicken pieces in a ginger, tomato and cashew nut sauce), pickled carrots and radishes, garden green salad, mango tapioca pudding, rice pudding, and fruit salad.    Their mango mois are always excellent--very creamy and not too sweet.        We were so full afterwards (we came in at 12:30pm) that we had no room for dinner!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and so were the service and atmosphere. We went in without a reservation on a Saturday night, and had to wait an hour for a table, but it was definitely worth it. The chicken Mo:Mo was an excellent appetizer--they are pretty much Nepalese dumplings, and the pork version is available also. I highly recommend ordering the lamb dal-bhat, which is a large platter consisting of rice, lentil soup, spinach dip, and the meat of your choice (or cottage cheese) in a rich spice-based sauce. It is all finished off with your choice of tea or coffee, and a mango rice pudding.   Honestly, it is worth going back for the bread alone."}
{"text":"Let's be honest. I was in Calgary for 2days, and wasn't really expecting to be floored by South-Asian Food. But this place, heck, it stood tall against restaurants in cities more popular for food from that part of the world (yes, I am refering to you Vancouver, Seattle, SF).  First up, this place is very unassuming...a tad bit shady looking from the outside with its blue neon lights...and is located in a tiny strip mall like area. But once you're in, its really classy. Staff is very courteous. We went in around 8pm (so, no I cannot comment on their lunch buffet)...and didn't find any problem with getting a table right away.  Service/Courtesy - 5/5 (the lady that helped us was super nice & resourceful)  Food - 5/5 (tip: there's a reason they've dedicated a whole freakin page on the menu to one dish. They're secretly telling you that's what they are really good at. Go ahead, show them you're running low on IQ, and pick something else; another recommendation, is to have the fish pakora [appetizer]...they're really good)  Pricey - $$ (pretty economoical...we spent ~$15/person for drinks + food)"}
{"text":"7$ for a starter, 23$ for the sampler, 15-20$ for meat and veggie dishes.  Best food in calgary.  From the handmade mango rice pudding.  The Dhal taster for 23$ was a great deal and a taste of everything.  You must get it 'hot' because it ads all the flavour of nepal.  The lamb was so delicious, a slight pink, tender.  Quality meat that didnt taste like a barnyard, which is hard as lamb usually lives in a barnyard eating hay all its life, which is difficult to get rid of that barnyard taste as animals usually taste like where they live and eat their whole life.  The sampler plate comes with everything you can dream of, including some bottomless tea or coffee  The Garlic chicken was so succulent it melts in your mouth.  The bread is amazing and perfectly done.  The Chili stirfry with pork is amazing.  The mango smooth lacthai or something was sweet and the right consistency for fruit in a  juice form.  The owner is there 24/7 making sure his ship is running in tip top condition.  Only thing I would say is he needs to spend less time with guests and as a server and more managing all the operations, and he needs to stop taking any tips too, even if he is serving, and give the waitress's their tips  I will be back again and again and again and again."}
{"text":"Really great food and amazing service. Only wish is that it was closer to me because it would totally be one of my favs. I would not hesitate to recommend to people. I would recommend making reservations if you want to avoid a wait as the place was extremely busy and seems like it would be most nights.   The parking lot is really weird here. I would just be very careful of other confused people parking in this uneven, bizarre parking lot.   The place looks like it is recently newly renovated. A small bar greets you as soon as you walk in past the doors. You can sit here and dine as well although it would not be ideal unless you are on your own. Lots more tables inside.   Our server was extremely friendly and helpful, asking if it was our first time there which it was. We asked for some recommendations and he pointed out the most popular appies, mains, etc.   They gave us a basket of chips (?) with some sauces that we munched on while waiting for our ordered food. We started off with the momos which are basically dumplings. Yummy! Definitely a good appetizer, good for sharing.   We had the Himalayan egg plant, spinach tarkari and  a chicken dish that I can't remember the name of. I want to say the Himalayan but I don't see it with chicken as a meat option on the online menu so I could be wrong.   The mains are served with a side of saffron rice and chickpeas which we both liked. The mains are served in a little individual pot like dish so it's easy to place in the middle and share.   Everything we ordered was great. You can choose how spicy to get some of your dishes so we got the eggplant on the spicy side and it had a good kick. I've never had an eggplant dish with a texture or flavour like this one, it almost tasted like it was BBQed with a smokey flavour and a more firm texture unlike most eggplant dishes that are very mushy.   We had a cake-like dessert dish and a mango pudding and we surprisingly liked the cake dish a lot more. It was very chewy and coconut-y which I loved. Mango dessert wasn't what I expected, it had a lot of other flavours in it that reminded me of something like chai. Would not order if you are looking for a pure mango, extremely fruity dessert but if you are willing to try something different, you can go ahead with this dish!  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place and can't wait to go back next time I'm in the mood for asian food."}
{"text":"Had the pork momos and the butter chicken. Seriously the best meal I've had in months. The service was great and the food was definitely worth the 5 star reviews"}
{"text":"Pork dumplings with dipping sauce were delicious. Lamb with spinach-tomato sauce had just the right spice. I will be back next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"Wow. That's about all I can think of to say... because this place is amazing! I'm always so excited to try foods from different parts of the world, and this experience did not disappoint. The restaurant is small but so gorgeous. It has a very relaxed atmosphere and prompt and polite service. We made a reservation for a Tuesday night, and I'm very glad we did because it was busy! The restaraunt is also super vegetarian friendly, yay!! At least half the dishes on the menu are made without meat, which is more choice that I typically get anywhere else. I ordered the vegetarian momos (dumplings)  as an appetizer and they were outstanding. For the main course I ordered the Vegetarian Chatpat, which was basically a spicy vegetable stew that came with a side of saffron rice, pita bread and bean salad. Yum! My boyfriend had the namesake of the place, the Himalayan Grill, with lamb and rice. It looked awesome! A word of warning though: there are 3 levels of \"spice\" to choose from on some dishes, and I thought medium would be perfect, but it was SO hot! Ahh! So if you aren't a fan of really spicy food, go with the mild option. The prices are incredibly reasonable too, considering the quality of the food! We will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this restaurant and I must say I was very impressed.  There service here is excellent and our waiter was very helpful in choosing the meal and he was honest in his recommendations. The location also matched the service; excellent.  I love spicy food so this place worked for me but worry not you can always order a mild dish and just enjoy the flavors your own way! I will for sure be back this was an extremely pleasant experience.   one note: MAKE RESERVATIONS. by chance I made some of  a Monday night and if I hadn't we wouldn't have eaten!"}
{"text":"Grilled eggplant dish was so good- INCREDIBLY flavourful with a tamarind twist. Himalayan chicken tasted like butter chicken with less flavour. Rice pudding was fruity and surprisingly worked really well, it was delicious. The rashmalai paneer desert was yummy with cardamom flavours. You can skip the cassava cake. The Filipino version is better."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for some time but I finally got in there this week.   I don't think I've ever had anything specifically called Napalese but the food is kind of Indian and kind of an Chinese fusion which totally makes sense geographically.  I have been through the Himalayan mountains but on the Napal side and I as curious about whether the food would be familiar to me at all.   It's not really what I ate in my travels but the fusion makes the combos and foods similar enough to foods I already know but different still.   The decor is nice - they renovated in August (I know because I tried to visit then) and it looks quite classy.   The servers are wonderful.   The menu is well put together.   I have vegetable momos (dumplings) which was more Chinese but even then not what i've had before (they were also beautiful little dumplings) and then Kathmandu Vegetables which was more indian with extra bread (basically indian nann) for dessert I had a clotted cream and pistachio which reminded me a bit of a Persian flavor I have had before.   I wasn't sure how spicy to make it,  so they made it mild and gave me hot sauce.  Mild is definitely not me but I liked the hot sauce mixed in and will try medium next time (maybe still with a side of hot sauce as mild truely was mild).  Overall I'm a big fan and will revisit.  We got lucky and didn't need a reservation but we went at kind of an odd time for most people's dinner.   You should probably call a head and get a reservation to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"Nepalese cuisine: still don't understand exactly what I ate but I like it!  A totally different type of culinary experience within Calgary than what is normal. I had one of the traditional dishes so I could try a bunch of different things and I have to say it was all delicious. I chose the lamb as my meat and it was very good. Look at everyone else's reviews that say essentially the same.   Make a reservation and try it out!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal out I've had in years. Starting with the smile when I walked in, to the helpful suggestions of the knowledgable wait staff this was a phenomenal experience.   Incredibly fresh ingredients, unbelievably tasty food and a chef who obviously  (my dinner companion kept referencing sex for the palate) cares.   I immediately bought gift certificates and left a big tip. I'll be back many times now that I know a place with this calibre of food exists."}
{"text":"If you have not been here before it is a must. I had never had Himalayan food before and really didn't know what to expect. (It is very similar to Indian) I ordered he Napoli plate with lamb. It was delicious, I really recommend getting their lamb. I was dining with a vegetarian who had also said the vegetarian dishes are really good and was very happy that she had a few options as it is so hard to find a restaurant with some good vegetarian options. The only thing that was a disappointment was the dessert. The mango rice pudding came with my meal and was so sweet it was inedible. It's unfortunate as the spices in the pudding were perfect."}
{"text":"This restaurant is Nepalese food, which is sort of like a cross between Indian and Chinese food. I've been there before and after the renovations and the restaurant looks fantastic after the renos.  The Himalayan is located in an unassuming strip mall on 17th Ave SW.  Now to the food.  For appies, I recommend the momos, which are these cute little dumplings with your choice of filling. I've had the pork and the veggie and they are both so good. I've tried almost all of the entrees and I love the curry with tomato butter rose cream sauce (forgot the name but it's like butter chicken but even more flavourful)! The eggplant vegetarian entree is good too. They also have a drink that is similar to the mango lassi, which is quite good. I've been so satisfied and so stuffed every time I've been there that I've never tried any dessert. They have this mango dessert that I see lots of people ordering so I will have to save some room for it next time.  Also, it's a relatively small restaurant so reservations may be required."}
{"text":"They brought us some type of crackers with two types of dipping sauces, a mango and a mint. Both were very tasty. For our appetizer, we had the Pork Mo-Mo (steamed dumplings). The sauce that came with it was good, but we always like to go spicy, so we had that sauce also. Everything is tasting great!!  For our main course, we ordered the Himalayan Grill (with lamb) and Chatpat (with chicken). More food than two people can eat. Taking leftovers home with the flat bread. Of course we had to get dessert,  so we got Himalayan cake and the Mango Cream. OMG!!!  IT WAS ALL FANTASTIC!!  I'll be rolling out of here. Would definitely come again and again and again. We have pictures of everything but dessert, couldn't stop long enough to take the picture!!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing short then amazing . I have eaten hear numerous times everything I have ordered is amazing Himalyian Grill there coconut flat bread there pork Momos. It's are go to spot and we also get take out love it. There staff is also amazing and always friendly."}
{"text":"Ate here while visiting my uncle. Must say that the momos were great! and so was the chilli fish and chau-chau noodles. Just the right amount of spice. The staff is super friendly and nice"}
{"text":"This place deserves the great reviews they have. Every time I come here I am never disappointed. The food is flavourful and amazing, and the servers are always extremely friendly and helpful. I love this place."}
{"text":"One of those small treats you just happen to stumble across. Noticed it whilst driving by one night and thought, \"I've never had Nepalese food.\" Went back a few days later and had a short wait after showing up unannounced. It's not very big and I can now understand why it was full of guests. We tried as many of the curries we could and enjoyed them all. I really enjoyed the Mo-Mo's."}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday with a group of 15. The staff was very accommodating of our group and the server was clearly experienced in waiting a large group table. Drinks and meal orders were taken at an appropriate time even though not everyone arrived at the same time. The bills were all split and nothing got mixed up. The restaurant is nicely renovated and has a lively ambience. Ordered the Paneer Dal Bhat which was a mixed plate. Asked for medium and there was no spice. Food was fairly flavourful but could have done with some heat. The rice pudding and chai at the end was a nice touch. Would be a cute place for a first date or business lunch."}
{"text":"We've had a lot of Indian food in the San Francisco Bay Area and are just starting to delve into the world of Himalayan/Nepalese. This was hands down the best we've had anywhere. The momos were far more flavorful than any we've had before (we ordered the pork!).   Got the Himalayan Grill (chicken was so juicy and yummy), which with another entree (the saag chana was out of this world), was plenty for two hungry people :) you could also split it 3 ways with an app.   If we lived in the area, I have no doubt we would be regulars here!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the city, for many reasons:  1. cozy, inviting space 2. super-friendly staff 3. authentic 4. their basa (great alternative to tilapia) is ++ 5. reasonably priced wine 6. many gluten free options 7. momo's!  worth a visit for a date night, or family outing.  p.s. - parking gets a bit tricky, so plan ahead + make reservations"}
{"text":"Tried it for dinner based on the reviews, was not disappointed. Friendly, attentive service. Had the pork momo (dumplings) and spinach Tarkari with lamb, both were very good. My son had the Thuk-pa soup, loved it. My wife tried grilled lamb and she, too was pleased. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place - the new renovation is nice, modern and not over the top.  Its a small place that seats 54.    Went for the buffet his afternoon.  I am vegetarian.  A smallish buffet but still enough to get you full.  Its a mix between good indian and good Indian chinese.  The flavors are as super strong as some North Indian restaurants...there is still a good amount of masala and its tasty, but not over the top.    Had the noodles (better than hakka style), naan, daal, saffron rice, a very nice mushroom spinach vegetable.  The salad bar and chutney had different flavors than typical indian food.   The dessert was blah.  The mango rice pudding was too bland and not enough taste.  Fruit salad was nice.  Halwa bites were blah.  Great service, and a nice addition to Calgary.  Not sure if its authentic nepalese food, but still nice."}
{"text":"This one of those places you regret if you miss it.  I went here with two of my friends. One is a vegetarian while me and other friend are meat eaters.  We started with veg momos as starters. Then proceeded to order Jomsom Vegetables and Lamb Himalayan Grill.  All three dishes are accompanied with rice and naan bread.   If you are from India, rice and naan takes up substantial amount of the meal. However the rice and bread provided aren't adequate for an Indian stomach.  Saying that my ratings as below   Food - 5/5 Service - 4/5 Cost to Quality - A little expensive. 3/5."}
{"text":"I waited a long time to go here because their hours are pretty limited and they are usually all booked up on the weekend! Spoiler: It was amazing!! The food, the servers, the decor! Yay!   We ordered the pork momos for starters and then I got the Himalayan lamb and my friend got the dal bhat plate with the chicken!   The pork momos were basically dumplings but with filling that was infused with spices (tasted like a kebab!). There was a tomato based dipping sauce that went really well with the momos! I would totally get this again - it was $8 for 6 of them so it's great to share! They have the momos with chicken or vegetable filling as well.  The Himalayan lamb was a really savoury curry with succulent lamb pieces and it came with rice and naan and potatoes as a side dish. The curry was so yummy - I was so happy with it! It went really well with both the rice and the naan! It was a good amount of food for one person ($18)   My friend had the dal- bhat which was a traditional Nepali plate which included three curries, rice, naan  and salad! One of the curries is a choice between chicken, chicken or cottage cheese. The other two curries are spinach and dal. This plate also includes a small dessert of mango pudding and chai ($23). Great for one person as well and a good start to Nepali food if someone is unfamiliar with what to order as it includes a variety of things!   I got a mango pudding for dessert as well and it was so yummy! It was really sweet and it had small pieces of rice in it! I got a larger version of this which was unexpected as I was hoping for the same size as the dal bhat version haha Oh well - it was really delicious so I can't complain :)   Overall, I would highly recommend this place! I had never tried Nepali food before but I think after this experience I will definitely be trying it more often!"}
{"text":"First-rate on flavor, first-rate on service and not even very expensive. We had a wonderful meal with dumplings, fish in a chili stir-fry, and chicken and eggplant, freshly-baked nan, and that cheese, cream and pistachio dessert whose name I can never remember. Everything was excellent, with fresh, interesting flavors. And the service was superb."}
{"text":"It was THE delicious meal we indulged on while we were in Calgary (and Banff). The aura of the interior is actually very gorgeous and would have been romantic if I was on a date. The price was very reasonable (for 2 hungry teenagers + 1 adult male + 1 female = about $18 USD per person). The dumplings were delicious (we ordered both the vegetable and the meat ones). All dishes we ordered were catered to our preference of spiciness. I would definitely go back again if I were to be in town."}
{"text":"I love The Himalayan - for take out, delivery and eat in. They are so polite, accommodating and friendly in the restaurant, it's such a great experience eating here (and they deliver quickly and efficiently and the food doesn't suffer - how rare). The food is incredible. My favorites are the Veggie Momo, Chatpat and ChauChau. Honestly everything I've had here has been great, so just go for whatever peaks your interest."}
{"text":"I've never had Nepalese food before but I'm always open to try something new!  A couple friends and I, well my one friend specifically, wanted to go for dinner at The Himalayan as it is one of her favourite places in Calgary.  The place was absolutely packed on a Saturday evening so make sure you make reservations if you're going on the weekend.  Apparently, they've done renovations recently - it is a small spot so you may have to squeeze in.  We were 5 and fit into a corner spot!  The place itself has a nice, friendly vibe to it as all the waiters/waitresses are very friendly.  We decided to share all the dishes, minus my sister who with her gluten intolerance ordered her own separate entrée. We went with:  -  Complimentary papadum - light and crunchy, the papadum came with a side dip of mint yoghurt and mango chutney.  We were starving (my sis and I didn't really eat all day) and ended up pounding back two of these baskets. - Cottage cheese choyla ($7.50) - cottage cheese is grilled and comes with garlic, ginger, herbs and mustard oil. Served with a side salad and crispy rice flakes and soy beans. The cottage cheese was bland and not worthy of stomach eating space. The flakes/soy beans were the best part of this dish. - Vegetarian chatamari ($7.50) - a traditional Newari rice crepe stuffed with cheese and vegetables and served with a side of mango sauce. Very light, flavourful and enough for all 5 of us to share. - Lamb dal-bhat ($23.00) - this is their traditional platter which consists of lamb, dal (lentils), bhat (saffron rice), saag (spinach in creamy sauce), flat bread and a couple other Nepali side dishes. I had a taste of the lamb and dal, both were good. The dal had a nice spiciness to it.  It also includes tea/coffee and dessert at the end. My sis picked the mango rice pudding - I was excited to eat this but I'm not sure if I am a fan of the combination. After trying it, I think I prefer either mango or rice pudding, not both. However, it was presented beautifully. - Tofu chau-chau ($14.00) - flour noodles with tofu, cabbage, carrots, chickpeas, onion, garlic, ginger and soya sauce.   The noodles were nicely done (not greasy) and had a good variety of vegetables. - 2x Cottage cheese chilli ($15.00) - stir fried with onion, pepper, tomato, green chilli, soy sauce and Nepali spices. I'm not sure why we ordered two of the same (left the ordering to someone else) but one is more than enough.  The sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste and a little too similar to the eggplant dish.  Oh well, I guess this is what happens when you eat with a vegetarian. - Cottage cheese and peas ($14.00) - creamy fenugreek leak based sauce, which was delicious.  Great for sopping up with the flat bread. - Eggplant is my favourite so I was happy with this dish but as said above, the flavours and spices were a bit too similar with the cottage cheese chili dish.  I'm a bit surprised by the high rating - when I see that, I expect mind blowing, delicious flavours coming my way.  Maybe it's because we requested the dishes to be mild (one friend can't handle spice)? Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes (meat makes everything better right)? I dunno, it might be a combination of factors but I left wanting more.  If I were to give it a rating, a 3.5 star is right on the money."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Calgary. This place has it all - great service and a solid menu of interesting delicious food including lots of vegetarian options. It's usually full so best to reserve a table ahead of time, or lately I've been ordering take out and picking it up. It's always ready on time and just as good as eating in."}
{"text":"I am in Calgary for a couple of days and thought I would try this place out as it was near my hotel. I havent had Nepali food beyond momos before, although I have seen that at tibetan restaurants before so I am unsure if its Nepali. I only got takeout here so I cant speak to the in restaurant service but it was busy and I didnt see any of the servers stand still for a second. I had the lamb tarkari, which comes with rice and flat bread similar to naan and a lentil and beans side dish. It was really really great. First the quantity of food was huge. I might have been able to share 2 of these entrees amongst 3 people. It was just the right amount of spice with a little bit of sweet at the end. It was a rich sauce but not too rich to leave a greasy after taste. The lamb was well cooked and seasoned. Pairs great with a lighter beer. I had it with an amber ale. Would definitely go here again if I am in Calgary."}
{"text":"If you have not been here..... what on earth are you waiting for??/ Oh a reservation... thats understandable. This place is DELICIOUS, we lucked out and were able to get a table one night without a reservation and boy am i thrilled we did. Now if only I could get in to go back!!! BEST COCONUT RICE ever!!!! and the MoMO's omg... more momo's please! so tasty.  I cant wait to go try the chau-chau. I really hope to make it for a lunch buffet so I can try everything! Seriously delightful, go, go now, and call me when you do so I can join you!"}
{"text":"Oh.... Man.   This place has been on my radar for a long time, as it's consistently gotten excellent reviews and has been very popular with many foodies across the board for a long time. I was therefore absolutely enthused to finally get a chance to check out this place for dinner on a Thursday night - only because my friend's LA phone number inspired them to find a table for us.   While the exterior is unassuming, in a strip mall in a part of the city I usually wouldn't ever find myself, the interior is absolutely spot on with it's décor choices and atmosphere - it's modern, classy, but not ostentatious - and I particularly liked the culturally appropriate paintings. The service and the wait staff were also very much on point, something you'd expect from a more high class joint.   Unfortunately, this is where the 5-star experience that is apparently expected of The Himalayan ends for me, and ends very rapidly.   Between the two of us, we tried the pork mo-mo and the lamb starter for appetizers. The pork mo-mo deserves the praise it's been getting - they were delicious and not unlike Chinese soup dumplings. The lamb appetizer, however, was very lackluster. The lamb was dry, and the \"rice crispie like crunchy topping\" was not at all inspiring. I felt that appie completely lacked flavor or anything distinct whatsoever.   Sadly, the disappointment didn't stop there - I had the Dal Bhat for my main, which from the menu seems like their staple, \"if you come here you should order this as it is a good representation of the diversity of flavours of this restaurant\" type of dish - it's a platter with a meat main and several side dishes.   I chose the lamb for the meat main - it was almost like a very thick lamb stew, in a very small cup that had maybe 5 squares of lamb in it - and I can't say it wasn't decently flavourful, but honestly if I did a blind taste test with this one and one from a buffet tray I can't honestly say I'd tell the difference.   The saffron rice was only mediocre - lukewarm and without much saffron fragrance. The pickled carrots were also nothing more than standard, some acid and some tart sweetness but nothing remarkable. The Pickled cabbage - I don't want to be disrespectful in case that was how it was supposed to taste, so I won't factor it into my review score, but the flavor was sour in a rancid way and also bitter without any sort of pleasant taste whatsoever!   The platter was also served with a lentil? soup and a creamy spinach side dish - while both that decent flavor and weren't offensive, again I didn't find this to be any more inspiring than any other run of the mill buffet table. I suppose the flat bread that came with the platter may just have been the best part (fluffy, light, and well baked).   I also had the Mango Moi drink, which is a mango and yogurt drink - I didn't even drink 1/4 of it - it was about 10x sweeter than I'm able to handle with a thick, saucy consistency that reminds me a lot of mango sauce that is put on sushi. Wow, what a mistake.   The mango rice pudding dessert was also so sweet and unremarkable that it was essentially unpalatable - both me and my friend could only handle about two spoonfuls before throwing in the towel.   It's a relief that this was a meal that was under 30/35$, because if it wasn't I would be incredibly offended at the quality/price ratio.   Because of the other stellar reviews, I will come back eventually and give this place another shot - maybe this was a one off. Based on this experience however, I'd say it's hardly worth the price or the hype."}
{"text":"This one's been on the radar since last summer. We've been introducing the kids to new tastes, cultures and cuisines over the past year and getting a great response. Sadly we got too busy last Fall to carry on with our adventures.  So we wanted to start off the New Year right. I was very excited to try this place, after reading all the positive reviews. Buffet is best for our family, allowing everything to get sampled and then the minions can go back for what they like. We took in the Sunday lunch Buffet and I have to say it was fabulous.   Incredible flavours from spicy beef with daikon, everest chicken (cashew nut & ginger sauce) to vegetables tareko and vegetable chau-chau...it was all so good. Proud of the kids, they tried a bite of everything and true to form went back for what they enjoyed most. And filled up on the naan bread (ha ha). The papadums were a nice touch to.   The restaurant itself is a lovely, clean, modern little place and the service really good. With or without the family, I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Oh why had I not discovered this place before! The food, the service and the ambience were all yummy! Make reservations if you are not sure, since it can get quite busy.  And, don't tell anyone else, let's keep this hidden secret to ourselves!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The momo (dump?ings) are extremely flavourful. I always find dumplings very bland in flavour but this ones restored my faith, they will blow your mind. We order the himalayan lamb, the chicken himalayan gril and shrimp chatpat; all were exquisite. The lamb was sort of sweet, the chicken very juicy and the shrimp had lots of flavor ( and there were lots of huge shrimps on the plate, not like in most restaurants where they put like 3 and the rest is vegetables to fill the plate). The safron rice was the perfect. And finally the mango rice puding was another mindblowing experience, there's no much rice in it and it doesnt exactly taste like mango either, you MUST order it though, no excuses. The service was fast and kind and just remarkable. We are definetely coming back for more.  Tip: make a reservation."}
{"text":"Oh so delicious.  First time I went here, maybe a year ago, it was almost empty.  Last week, packed and reservations required - apparently lots of people are finding this gem!  I don't know much about the difference between Himalayan and, say, Indian, food - but I do know that this is flavourful, fullsome and delicious food.  It seems to be family run, which is always nice.  The naan was excellent, along with the chicken spinach dish I had (forget the name).  Everything else looked excellent as well!"}
{"text":"ambiance 8/10  food authenticity 9/10 food taste 8/10 service and staff 8/10 so this place was a surprise package for me I was expecting  something very normal but this place was everything you want in a restaurant, definitely recommend this place had a lot of fun."}
{"text":"This place is stellar! Excellent food, especially the lamb. Nice atmosphere, accommodating with kids. And superb staff. We really enjoy ourselves every time we've been and will definitely be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"We've all been taught the adage 'don't judge a book by its cover' but I know we fickle creatures tend to ignore it more often than not.  In the case of the Himalayan, I've dismissed it for so long simply because of its relatively non-descript storefront and boy, am I kicking myself for not discovering this place sooner. Would you believe that beyond the plain storefront is a beautiful restaurant wonderfully decorated with textures, woods and romantic dim lighting? Seriously great date night spot and brownie points if you brought a first date here.  Moving onto the best part - the food. I'm not familiar with Nepali cuisine but I am familiar with good food and this place offers a lot of that. The dishes are a blend of Asian and Indian style flavors. Where one is plainer the other infuses with aromatic spices and where one is heavy the other makes slightly lighter.  For example,  typical butter chicken tends to be heavy and rich. Here, maybe with the added ginger it feels a bit lighter and I can walk away without feeling like I need to drink copious amounts of tea. Because nothing is too overwhelming oil or sodium wise, I also feel like I can eat here often without the tummy ache or guilt (and believe me, I have been). My favorite things here remain the lamb choyla and the momos  (any kind). I've never had anything quite like the lamb and as a texture person,  the crunchy rice combined with the spices and meat makes this dish a literal party in my mouth. Same with the momos. If you don't know what they are, they're sacs of juicy, drippy pork or vegetarian goodness stuffed inside a soft steamed doughy exterior. My only complaint is that there isn't more because I can literally eat 20 of these.   Mo(re) mo(re) please"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of Calgary for sure! I saw so many great Yelp reviews I just had to hit it up. Nepalese food is definitely influenced by the Indian cuisine which makes sense as they are neighbors but the food is distinctly sweeter! The food was had was delicious and it went perfectly with the wine. We shared an appetizer, half bottle of wine, entrée and dessert and the total only came out to about $50 which if you ask me for two people to eat is very reasonable. I definitely think this is one of the reasons I would go back here because you do get such a great value for your meal. The staffs were very friendly and the manager came around to check up on us numerous times which was really nice. I loved the décor they had - the ambiance was so serene and I really liked the cultural and religious influence even though I'm not religious at all! I love when I can go to a restaurant and eat fantastic food and learn a little about a culture I didn't know much about!"}
{"text":"I'll have some momo of that please!  The Himalayan is a lovely little restaurant over yonder on 17th Ave. With a menu full of interesting eats, servers and staff that take good care of you throughout your meal and glasses filled with cucumber water (mmm... my favourite kind!), it's a guarantee I'll be stopping by here again soon.  We ordered momos to start, they're a kind of dumpling filled with vegetable, chicken or pork and each coming with a side dipping sauce. After the momos, I ordered the Himalayan lamb entree-roasted lamb in a creamy tomato, red wine and cashew nut sauce and served with saffron rice, salad and flat bread. It reminded me of a curry. Tip: The kitchen usually prepares a mild version of their dishes. If you like spicy, just ask!  There's a lunch buffet Tuesday-Sunday. All you can eat for $12.50. Sounds like my next visit has already been laid out for me!"}
{"text":"My family took me here for Mother's Day and it was their first time here.  I came here when they used to have a lunch buffet which was the best ever!  But sadly, they no longer have it.  It was a very busy night and thankfully we got our reservations !  It's located in a strip mall and parking may be hard on a busy night and you have to find parking on side street.  We each ordered an entree so we can share.  We found that it was enough to feed 6 adults.  We ordered an order of pork dumplings (pork mono) to start with a plate of garlic naan bread.  Both were tasty and that bread came piping hot & fresh to our table!  We each had either the fragrant coconut rice or the saffron rice . Most of the dishes ordered came with one or the other rice choices. We had the Himalayan grill entree with chunks of grilled lamb, a Chow chow noodle dish with shrimp, Butter chicken (my fav), mango fruity with shrimp dish, spinach dish with tomato & chicken and a mixed veggie dish. We asked for mild or medium spice level which was perfect.  Of course we had to get another order of that most delicious naan again!  Everyone enjoyed this wonderful meal and to end it, the couples each shared the pretty creamy mango rice puddings and one had a cheese type dessert.  We all relaxed with the fragrant soothing chai teas and it was the best Mother's Day meal enjoyed by all of us!"}
{"text":"It was my first time having Himalayan/Nepalese cuisine and it was fantastic!  Started with an order of the pork mo-mo. It was steamed dumplings spiced with cumin and other flavors. I would definitely order this again!  Tried the traditional Nepalese dinner set (Dal-Bhat) with chicken and all the various dishes were fantastic. Spinach was well cooked, chicken was tender and the potato salad was delicious.   Also ordered the eggplant which was a twist on sweet and sour flavors. Also delicious but not as unique as the Dal-Bhat.   It was so good that a repeat visit was required for the lunch buffet.   Service was great and the food variety was a great sampler for their menu.   My favorite items during lunch included the noodles, stir fried veggies in a slightly tangy sauce and the beef.   Spice profile is similar to Indian cuisine but the chef here seems to have a great understanding in melding the various flavors and spices so they complement each other. No single spice or flavor stands out and overpowers the dishes. Absolutely must try and must stop place in Calgary!"}
{"text":"What?!?!? What a yummy lunch buffet!!!!  Hmmm to saucy dishes, basmati rice, and and warm naan :)  5* for lunch buffet!   Dinner 4*"}
{"text":"Wow, the food is amazing here. This place lives up to the hype. Got the Himalayan grill w basa fish. Perfect crisp on the outside, delicious spices/flavouring esp if you like a spicy kick. If not, can order mild. Mango juice was refreshing. Got The pork momos (dumplings) and veggie momo for starters, all  very yummy."}
{"text":"Make the hike! Calgary is one lucky town to have this restaurant. Food, service, ambiance - it was a great experience.  Having read reviews, I had the pork momos - they are like Indian pot stickers with a tomato based dipping sauce. Nice pork filling. Easy to eat, harder to explain. My entree was the Himalyan lamb that came with saffron rice and a small side. Similar to Indian, but slightly sweeter (probably the cashew). What really worked was a reasonably strong sauce that still allowed the lamb flavor to come through. And - the lamb was perfectly cooked.  I went for dinner at 5:30 on a Wed and by 6:30p folks were cued up. Others were stopping in to request weekend reservations two weeks out. Cult following?  As others have said in reviews - the place is in a strip mall with almost no parking. Seriously. I think there were only 3 spaces allocated to the Himalyan. Can't take away for that though - finding great food requires effort and occasionally sacrifice. If it wasn't good there wouldn't be a logistics issue."}
{"text":"Wow, this place totally deserves all the hype. My brother was in town and for whatever reason decided he wanted Nepalese food. The Himalayan has been on my radar for a while so we foolishly showed up here at 5:20 on a Friday night thinking it couldn't be that busy that early. They told us there wouldn't be a spot until 8:30 and they were also booked solid Saturday and Sunday night. I feel like the customers sitting at the front were giving me a look that basically said YOU KNOW NOTHING JON SNOW. Learning from this experience, I made a reservation and I had totally already picked out what I wanted from the menu before I showed up. That is how excited I was.  Even though I had high expectations, The Himalayan did not disappoint. The food was amazing. I was a bit skeptical about the momos because the vegetable ones say there is cheese inside and we are a family of cheese haters. However, they tasted surprisingly good and the spicy sauce that came with them was really delicious. My vegetarian chatpat was super flavorful and the medium spice was just enough to make me blow my nose a lot but not enough to make me cry. I tried the dal and spinach from my brother's plate and they were both so good. Better than most dal and spinach dishes I've had at Indian places; there is something a bit different about them, I can't quite put my finger on it. The side we got was a cold potato salad thing that I really enjoyed. The saffron rice was lovely - very light but packed with flavour. And the flat bread. It. Is. So. Good. It's somewhere between naan and steamed buns. The mango rice pudding was probably my least favourite thing but I am a person who doesn't like mango lassi; it reminds me a lot of that.   The service was extremely friendly and our waiter was very attentive. The restaurant is very cozy and the ambience is lively but still intimate. I will definitely be back and you should go too!"}
{"text":"Had lunch buffet here today and was blown away.  A nice variety of really authentic dishes, restocked every couple of minutes. Chicken, beef, fish, veggies. Everything was delicious.  The owner was super nice and friendly despite the line that had formed."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, atmosphere was fantastic, staff was fantastic, and the prices seemed reasonable.  We were in a party of 6, including 2 semi-picky youth, and everyone loved every part of the experience.  I'm sure I will eat here every time I'm in Calgary going forward.  Make sure you make a reservation! We got lucky and squeezed in because we showed up right when they opened."}
{"text":"What a wonderfully tasty place this is!  Starting with the Vegetable Mo-Mo ( delicious little mini pockets stuffed with shredded veggies accompanied by a delicious dip), Tofu Mau-Mau ( homemade flour noodles with crispy  tofu and shredded cabbage in a spicy sauce, and finishing with the cottage cheese Dal Baht ( creamy cashew tomato sauce served with an assortment of mini tastes from the himalayan/Nepali region.  This place is tucked away in a little strip mall and doesn't appear like anything special from the outside but I promise you that a mouth watering surprise awaits through the doors!"}
{"text":"We had Valentine dinner at that restaurant, to be ownest we were not impressed with the food. But in another hand they gave a lot of vegan dishes...."}
{"text":"Review: dinner.  I've been to The Himalayan numerous times since I moved to Calgary and it has been my favorite for years now. I won't do it justice if I don't talk about them.  Bottomline: small boutique restaurant that serves consistent phenomenal flavorful food unique to Calgary. Definitely a must try.  Atmosphere: located on the west end of 17th Ave, this little gem is tucked away in one of the strip malls and easy to miss. Place is constantly busy so make sure to make a reso at least a week ahead of time.  Food: I've been to the restaurant numerous times and have tried almost everything on the menu. There's yet a dish that has disappointed me so far. Everything has great deep flavors and balanced very well. The chef is able to combine Asian cuisine with Indian spices like peanut butter and jam. The end result is something very unique and delicious. Oh and did I mention every table starts off with a light plate of homemade chips and dips? Awesome way to segue into the appys and entrees.  Value: fantastic food at a fantastic price. Considering the quality and taste, this place has everyone beat in regards to price. Expect fine quality food at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Impeccable service, and wonderful wonderful food. Had the vegetable Mo Mo, and the cottage cheese Choyla for starters. Tried the Himalayan grill, the Mango Fruity, and the Chau Chau ... all of which are delicious. The Himalayan grill was my favourite."}
{"text":"I first went here because it was so highly rated on Yelp and was thoroughly impressed... enough to keep coming back! I've been back twice since, and the last time I was there for the lunch buffet.   This has become a favourite for me and I can't believe this little gem isn't overrun. The food is spectacularly good, the portions are great (and unlimited if you go for the buffet), the service is polite, and it has a comfortable atmosphere.   I just can't say enough about the food. When I went for the buffet, I admit I went for thirds. Yeah, thirds. Seriously. I don't know how it all fit, but it did. I'm sure I was a wafer-thin-mint away from exploding but it was so worth it.  The last time I was there, I brought a friend who actually hasn't Yelped in years and said he enjoyed the food so much that he couldn't wait to write a review. So, there you have it. Well deserving of all five stars."}
{"text":"Make Reservation!   I used to just walk in. But after the new renovation, dinning there on a Tuesday night, OMG it was fully booked! (I am very happy for this place!)  Always start with the pork mo:mo; the dumplings are very juice. Mango Fruity (shrimp) is the must order main course for me! Very creamy and rich! Dipping the sauce with the Flatbread just delicious!  For dessert, I love the homemade mango cream & ice-cream! Thick and rich and creamy and not super sweet and ... just loving it!  The main courses used to come with salad and that was the only thing I did not like, but now they changed to some peas and beans, I think they are better!"}
{"text":"Quality of food was very good. The service was very good as well and the interior is quite pretty and well decorated. I did find it a bit pricey though. $67 for 2 ppl but I still think it is worth a visit especially if you have haven't tried Nepalese food.  We started with chicken momo's. The mains were Himalayan Eggplant  (hot) and the Himalayan Grill with Basa. Both were delicious! Melt in your mouth fish and the eggplant was really well seasoned and was actually spicy.  We finished off with Mango rice pudding and Cassava cake. Again both were quite tasty."}
{"text":"Friends of ours made reservations here and I'm absolutely thrilled to have another fabulous cultural experience in Calgary under my belt.    I love the decor and the fact that the restaurant has limited seating.  It allows for a quieter dining experience which is manageable with a larger group.  I hate yelling while I eat.    The Pork Momo is a great starter and I could have eaten the dipping sauce with a spoon.  I tried the Chicken Mango Fruity and while I expected something different (like actual mango chunks, I suppose), I still really enjoyed the dish and would order it again in a heartbeat.  Both breads may have been the best I've ever had in a restaurant and I could make a meal out of a few pounds of that alone.    I can't wait to return and try other dishes, as each and every one looked enticing.  I'm also excited to bring out-of-town company here."}
{"text":"I'm glad I finally got to experience this place. After hearing great things about it, it did not disappoint.  You have to make a reservation to eat here as it is a very popular place, and with good reason! The staff, ambiance and food are wonderful.  I will definitely go back! Yum!"}
{"text":"We don't have a Himalyan/Nepalese restaurant where I live so when visiting Calgary, this was definitely a treat to experience! I came shortly after 5PM on a Sunday and many of the tables were reserved - I think I was lucky to get a table without a wait. As others mention - service was excellent...throughout my meal, my drink was refilled and I was asked how everything tasted and given updates on what is yet to come. The ambience is relaxing - I actually didn't need alcohol to unwind - listening to the music and taking in the wooden decor and pictures/art on the walls was soothing - they did an amazing job with a small space in a strip mall. The vegetable momos were presented nicely - I wasn't that big a fan of the vegetables in them - the menu notes there is mozzarella in the momos but I think the vegetables dominate and there didn't seem to be spice within the momo to enhance the flavors of the veggies.  The sauce that accompanies them helps with that.  I think on my next visit, I would try the pork ones. Though the butter chicken was tempting, I ordered the pork chili stir fry - with Nepalese spices - they can customize the spice intensity to your liking - this dish was tasty and not too filling.   Considering that rice, flat bread, a salad, and crackers are all included with an entry - the prices here are very reasonable.  I really enjoyed the Nepalese black tea as well.  The Himalayan is a nice place to celebrate a special occassion with friends or impress a date. Take out business is thriving too."}
{"text":"This restaurant is incredible. The staff are kind and helpful, and the seating area itself is beautifully decorated. Not to mention the food is so delicious. It's a perfect spot if you already love South Asian food (Indian/Pakistani...etc)"}
{"text":"The first attempt we were sent on our way - reservations a must. Second, with reservations on a Sunday, early - we were told we would have two hours then another reservation would take over our table. It was busy but we would have been out sooner if a) the order was correct the first time and b) the food was not so good we had to order more. Fact is the service struggled and the portions are small but everything was good. From vegetarian crepes to a lamb appetizer to the Himilayan Prawns and Cottage cheese with peas the meal is worth coming back for. It is a small space so yes children are welcome but there is no sound barrier so to speak."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and excellent service!  The chicken cauliflower and Himalayan tofu were amazing.  If I'm ever back in Calgary this restaurant will be top on my list!"}
{"text":"So I've heard good things about this place and it's been on my radar for about 5-6 months now.  Since it's practically on the other side of the city for me I decided I had to just pick a day to go.  What better night than date night?!?  (My wife and I designate 1 night a week to each other)  I pick up Aiofe from the train station and we head over to the bustling 17th Ave SW in the neighbourhood of Killarney.  I figured this place wouldn't be busy on a Wednesday night so I forego the reservations.  First mistake.  This place was packed!  As soon as we walked in we saw all the tables were full except for 2 tables which had reserved signs on them.  What we also noticed was the lovely and welcoming atmosphere in there.  The smell of great spices, dimmed lights, dark wood decor all played with our senses.  This was home.  We were told it would be a 20 minute wait and we promptly decided it would be worth it.  After a quick gas fill-up at the Esoo a few blocks away and a short shopping stint at the hair salon (Aiofe had to pick up hair products) we returned all excited for our table.  They apologetically told us it would be a few more minutes and let us sit at a reserved table to wait.    We were given menus to peruse anyways so it wasn't a problem.  Not even 3 minutes later we were seated at our VERY OWN TABLE!  The staff was friendly and always smiling and saying, please and thank you.  We felt important.  Aiofe has a severe nut allergy so we mention this and they promptly said they would investigate.  They indicated which ones would be safe to order and which ones weren't.  I had the eggplant and boy was I amazed!  It burst with flavour at ever bite.  The dessert (cassava cake) tasted like a home made delight.  You can taste the coconut and the texture and consistency was perfect.  I recently visited again for their weekend lunch buffet.  I'd have to say it's a good option if you like Indian food but want something a bit different.  Oh yeah, second mistake; I waited this long to try it!"}
{"text":"This super busy place has amazing, unique food.  Definitely make a reservation as the place is so popular.  Parking is a challenge so carpool if you are going with friends.    I often just call ahead and pick up takeout as it is easier at the last minute since it is usually reserved in  advance!"}
{"text":"I went there based on yelp reviews.. And I have to say that the reviews were right!,.. Everything was delicious there!,.. Since the appetizers to the desserts!!... in Addition  The service was excellent!,.. Also, the prices are very good... and the place is beautiful...  If you enjoy exotic food, you shouldn't miss this place...  I definitely recommend this place, and I will definitely go back there soon..."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great ambiance. Have tried pretty much everything on the menu and everything is great. Service is amazing. Definitely try the grilled fish! Tip: Make reservations!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing and unique Nepalese cuisine. I've been frequenting this establishment since it opened in my area, and continue to go there regularly despite moving very far away. Outstanding vegetarian dishes, rotating sides, and outstanding eggplant (they just know how to cook it). I've gone for dinner and for the lunch buffet and it's always hot, delicious, and satisfying. Friendly staff and a recent expansion speak to the longevity of this restaurant and all of the things they are doing right. You must do a reservation if you want to eat here for dinner ;)"}
{"text":"Don't let this restaurant's unassuming exterior fool you, inside it's all delicious momos. friendly servers, clean, great decor, and unique, interesting food. I tried the Himialayan sizzler platter with lamb and it tasted as good as it smelled. The naan bread and the house made dips were also really good. It's great that this style of cuisine is offered in Calgary. I'll certainly be back to try more."}
{"text":"Went here in July 2015. It was my first time trying Nepalese food, and I was pleasantly surprised. The food and ambiance were excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excellent food. We got a few things to share as a group of four. Basically everything is great. We got an additional order of garlic naan cause it was so delicious. All the meat and fish and curries were flavourful. The ambience is great for a cozy night together. The chai is amazing as well as the mango dessert. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Located beside Joey's Seafood in a little strip mall The Himalayan is a small popular place serving some of the most delicious curries you will ever enjoy. Just inside the front door is a fully stocked bar with banquette seating along the opposite wall. The bar is separated from the eating area by a few screens creating a narrow walkway for staff to serve from the kitchen in the back. There are a few tables beside these screens and a few move along the back wall. The place is cosy and stylish with the staff all dressed in black. A family run place the food is the real star, made clear because the place is always busy. There are a selection of Tibetan and Indian styled appetizers and a range of curries available with assorted proteins. All the mains arrive plated on stylish oversized dishes with rice, bread and a curried potato salad. We ordered the Chana saag, which was really yummy and an eggplant dish with shrimp that was good. Another table ordered the mango curry which looked absolutely wonderful, so next time I have to have that. The service is fast, attentive and friendly and the food delicious."}
{"text":"Every time i come to Calgary, i need to go to this restaurant and bring my son. We love the food here!. I was happy to see that the restaurant expanded, they needed it as it was always busy!. It is as usual, unassuming from the outside and located on a strip mall, but now its got a bigger space and lovely decor on the inside. Food, was again very good, lovely time was had and service was excellent!. Great food in Calgary. Cant wait to visit again."}
{"text":"LOVE. The food is incredible and the price is right. So glad to hear they're expanding, as the size of the place and the tricky parking is the only drawback."}
{"text":"Friday night, after many recommendations from friends we ventured to The Himalayan.   It was incredible! Great service, delicious food and a fantastic selection for GF/Vegetarian food. I had the Hot Vegetable Chatpat and boyfriend had the chicken dumplings with rice.  So delicious, fair prices. Will DEFINITELY go back!"}
{"text":"Finally, got to try the lunch buffet at The Himalayan.  I had a $2.00 coupon and could use it for the lunch buffet.   There was a line-up at the door before 11:30 a.m. on Saturday.  I had made reservations and am glad I did.    Fresh naan bread was brought to the table.  The buffet was nicely laid out with popaddums, saffron rice with cubed carrots and peas, vege dish, lentil (almost like a soup), eggplant & chicken; fish in a nice spicy mustard seed sauce, chicken in a cashew red sauce, salad bar, pakora, interesting condiments of mint & yogurt, mango hot sauce, and desserts of halva, mango rice pudding and fresh cut fruits like guava, papaya & pineapple with yogurt and shredde coconut.  Everything was good.  Just missing the spice.  Really, good customer service.  They have a watchful eye and remove dirty dishes once you've finished a plate and go for seconds, thirds??!!    Limited parking space in the strip mall.    I learnt that the restaurant will be closed for renovation at the end of May 2014 for 2 months.  So if you like The Himalayan, you'd better get there fast before it closes down for renos!"}
{"text":"The Himalayan is a cozy restaurant with a diverse menu. To start we ordered: the cottage cheese choyla. It's cubed cottage cheese with spices and herbs---has a spongy texture, really flavorful.  The pork mo mo--essentially a pork dumpling served with nice tomato dipping sauce. The Fish Tareko, a chick pea battered basa served with a their house hot sauce. Warning, hot sauce is very spicy, but so good. For my main I order the Himalayan Lamb. Comes with a chick pea salad, rice and naan bread. It's a saucy dish, great for dipping and eating with rice. A friend ordered the traditional plate, which had a little of everything, a great way to sample flavors. The Saag (spinach in creamy sauce) was AMAZING, a must try."}
{"text":"Rather than repeat what everyone else is saying about this restaurant, I recommend you go try it.    Really good food, really good service, looking forward to returning soon!  :}"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Asian restaurants in the area. It is definitely a unique taste and something that everyone should try once.   Nepalese food, as I'm led to believe, is a bit of a mix between East Indian, Chinese, and other Asian influences. The result are some truly spectacular dishes that offer a variety of flavours.  The restaurant itself is quite small, so I would recommend making a reservation beforehand. During the evenings, the place does get filled up quickly and you can wait up to 1 hour for a table, but it's well worth it.   Service is okay. On the two occasions that I've been here, the servers were not overly friendly nor were they very helpful with the menu. That being said, the owner came out to welcome us and to answer some of our food-related questions. Also, the staff were very quick and grabbed us extra utensils quickly after we asked.   In regards to the food, I would definitely recommend trying their Mo:Mos. They are this unique mixing of Chinese soup dumplings with a curry-like sauce. Definitely a must try! The only issue is that they give you only 3!! Not nearly enough, since they are just so tasty!   I would also recommend getting their DalBhat dish, which is like a sampler plate of their more popular/traditional dishes. It is a good place to start. I would also recommend their mango fruity (with either the chicken or shrimp - both are good!), which has a very rich sweet & savory sauce that is fabulous. We also have had their chau chau, which is a stir-fried noodle dish, similar to Shanghai chow mien.   In terms of pricing, I think things are reasonably priced. Some dishes are a little smaller than expected, but I honestly think they are worth the price given that they are so flavourful! Definitely one of my favourite restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Good Indian food in Calgary. If you are used to Indian food please order their spicy food. Spicy is actually medium. Good ambience and good service. Friendly staff.  We got Chicken Dal shared between 2. It had naan bread, lentil daal, chicken curry, rice, coffee. Good for 2 to share."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! If it wasn't for Yelp I wouldn't have known about it, it is hidden in a plaza on 17th ave and the outside is very unassuming. Well the newly renovated restaurant is very nice and good enough for me for a date night! Service was fantastic and the food was the same! I will head back very soon and Himalayan is now on my regular rotation of restaurants! Renovations are definitely recommended as the place was packed for a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Incredible food. The best Nepalese I've had in my life. My fiancee had the Himalayan lamb which came on a grill with long yellow rice, a cold potato dish, and lentil soup. The meat was juicy and flavorful.  I had the butter chicken which was tender and savory. The sauce was also an incredible complement to the naan.  Servers checked up on us just enough without making it feel intrusive.  Very excellent food and attentive service. I wish I lived here. I would come to eat every week if I could."}
