{"text":"Mediocre food and very poor service make for a very plain experience  The chicken was just ok, kind of on the dry side. The entree of squid was extremely salty and consisted of two small pieces.  Salad was wilted. The service was extremely inattentive. The location is smack in the middle of the village and on this evening from our terasse seat we observed a mentally ill man punching a metal light post, a 7 foot transvestite fighting with a group of youngsters and other classy entertainment lol"}
{"text":"C'est le plus mauvais service que j'ai jamais connu de ma vie. 4 serveurs sont passés à notre table mais personne n'a pris la commande. Après 15 minutes d'attente on a finalement pris notre commande mais lorsque les factures sont arrivées tout était mélangés et ça pris 2 personnes et 20 minutes pour régler le tout. Heureusement, la nourriture n'était pas trop mauvaise."}
{"text":"This has to have been the worst ding experience I've ever had, bordering on abusive service. We ended up asking for the check before the mains arrived but more than an hour after being seated. It was not busy."}
{"text":"Had good food but there was so many moths flying around. Had to constantly swipe them away..."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese chicken in town !
The rest of the menu is good but nothing special but the chicken is totally worth it. 
It's not neighborhood, but I make sure to go every now and then to get my hands on this rich, juicy, tasty and not too greasy chicken."}
{"text":"We just wandered into this place. The sandwiches (we had steak and fish) were great. The french fries were VERY good and quite different. The waiter (Very nice and helpful) said that the recipe and the way they were cooked were a secret. Best fries we ever tasted. If we are ever in Montreal again, we would stop by for another lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I used to like this place the piri piri sauce is amazing although I use it like dipping sauce so I ordered a medium sauce on the side and they gave me 4 really small cups. I gave a bad review before but after eating it I have to admit their sauce is to die for and the chicken is delicious they won me over"}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night and sat out on the patio where we had a great view of the passing walking street traffic.  The service was great, and the food was good.  Price was reasonable as well.  We shared a grilled shrimp appetizer, which was perfect - not over cooked, with a spicy dipping sauce; yum.  My wife had the Portuguese salad with pan fried salmon, and she enjoyed it.  I had the Cod which was served with a creamy white sauce.  Both came with braised veggies consisting of carrots and green beans.  Very nice.  They also had Portuguese wine by the glass which was fine.  All in all a fun evening.  I would recommend this place near the metro station in the Latin Quarter."}
{"text":"The sauce is pretty expensive but other than that, quite delicious. The chicken is even better. Probably my favourite Piri Piri chicken so far."}
{"text":"This well-known chain opened up a new location here and being close to my work, I decided to give it a go.

I ended up trying out the 2 piece chicken with fries and salad. Everything was made to order and the wait wasn't too long, maybe 5-7 minutes at most. The chicken was moist and had enough seasoning to satisfy. As well, I ordered the hot version so it was quite spicy if you are into that sort of thing. The fries were mediocre but not terrible and the salad was nothing to write home about.

All in all, it's good if you need some grilled chicken and don't mind going to a very casual restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered a family dinner style meal. It came with chicken, fries and salad. I thought the food was delicious, the chicken had great flavor! Fries too! My only complaint is the food took a very long time (30-40 minutes) when the restaurant was practically empty. It was worth the wait, but still! Our waiter was also kind but very talkative (to other patrons, probably regulars?) which lead to us waiting 10-15 minutes after we had asked for our check. We needed to rush out for a commitment so that was a slight inconvenience. I would definitely return when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Service is slow but food is good! I often go for lunch and take the spicy chicken. I've had the grilled chorizo, the sardines and the pasteis de nata: everything tastes great. 

In the summer, the terrace is nice   
Definitely a good spot to stop for lunch, but if you are in a rush, forget it!"}
{"text":"They seem to have some little man running around doing deliveries drinking beer he seems drunk and he's yelling and screaming at people on the street totally destroyed the peace and quiet of the Terrace ."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, great food, and the wonderful atmosphere outside.  The chicken was delicious since it was flavorful and tender.  The appetizer meat pies were very tasty, I only wished there were more.  The shrimp appetizer in butter, wine and garlic was divine.  We used the crusty bread to absorb every last flavorful drop.  If you are looking for a place to people watch, and enjoy the festive atmosphere while getting good eats, it is perfect. If you want a quick meal, come back later."}
{"text":"Bonne petite rôtisserie du quartier, le poulet portugais est vraiment excellent (grillé sur charbon), accompagné de frites et salades. Le service était agréable, l'alcool - vin et bière - était bon. Et si vous avez de la chance, vous pourrez croiser des stars... (c'est à coté de l'Olympia...)
A essayer!"}
{"text":"The chicken is delicious....but the service is often rushed, poor and unfriendly.  I don't like the fact they won't take orders for takeout, especially for regular patrons who live nearby.  I would buy a lot more family meals if they supported takeout...."}
{"text":"Le service est très lent. 
Beaucoup d'erreurs sur les commandes le soir où j'y suis allé. 
Par contre, pour le goût exquis de leur poulet portugais, j'y retournerai sans doute..."}
{"text":"This place was great.  My wife and I shared a grilled octopus appetizer and some prosciutto.  Absolutely delicious with a glass of red wine.  Good service.  Glad we stopped by."}
{"text":"The chicken was very delicious. It is a rotisserie chicken with a very nice seasoning. Nicely charred. And their red wine sangria is delicious."}
{"text":"We had an amazing lunch here! The 1/2 chicken costs $12 and comes with both fries and a salad. I have a huge appetite and the portion size was perfect for me. There are also options to make it spicier or to get smaller portions (1/4 chicken). The fries were incredible and the chicken was tender, grilled to perfection. The restaurant itself is in a good location near Berri-Uqam metro, with a casual yet nice atmosphere. There are TVs there for sports as well and you can order wines/beers too! There is a terrace outside during the summer. The rest of the menu has good selection (primarily chicken but fish too!) with very reasonable prices. The waiter accidentally threw away the leftovers instead of saving it, but they offered a complimentary dessert to make up for it. Overall, I would highly recommend this place for a reasonably priced yet excellent lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent endroit pour manger des grillades portugaise. Le poulet cuit sur charbon de bois est délicieux. Les prix sont abordables, environ dix dollars pour un quart cuisse et un verre de bière en fut."}
{"text":"Du poulet portugais bon mais pas excellent non plus, j'ai un peu de mal avec la peau du poulet brûlée même si la cuisson de la volaille était correcte, le tout servi avec frites et salade (frites moyennes, pas de sauce salade?). Espace convivial à prix abordable, 23$ pour 1/4 de poulet et une bière. Bon service en revanche! La terrasse est agréable l'été, le décor intérieur étonnamment canadien pour l'hiver.
Après avoir essayer plusieurs restos sur la rue Ste Catherine je dois dire que tous se ressemblent un peu niveau qualité culinaire. C'est ici où l'on trouve le plus de restos au mètre carré mais pas forcément là où l'on trouve les meilleurs, soit."}
{"text":"Slow service but good food!
Came here for a late lunch on Wednesday afternoon.... Was a bit confused as we were not greeted and took a seat outside.
The server took a while to come to the table.
I ordered the chicken club sandwich which was nice! The portions were huge, bread was soft and fresh, and chips were yummy!
Definitely stop by here if you want a good feed"}
{"text":"Walking down Rue Ste-Catherine, my travel companion and I stopped in for lunch, because Portuguese restaurants aren't a common thing in our home of Ottawa.  Whispering \"chorizo\" in my ear is almost like flashing boobs to a man.

So naturally I ordered the chorizo sandwich, with a salad on the side.  It was *pretty* good but I wasn't jazzed about the dry bun it came on.  The vinegrette on the salad was alright too.  I enjoyed the fries that came with my friend's meal quite a bit.

The service was very pleasant: they seem to have a lot of tall, good looking young men working there.  We were treated warmly, but the service was a touch slow.  They said they were recovering from the mad lunch rush.  They kept a pitcher of water by the door, so we weren't sure if we had to serve ourselves or not, but we did.  What's up with self-serve water in restaurants these days?  Serve me hand and foot, peasants!

Oh, and if you sit on the patio at the right time, you get an eyefull of pole dancing lessons two storeys up across the street, so needless to say it drew a crowd.

Anyway, it was \"ehn.\"  Not too bad, but not memorable."}
{"text":"The owner of our bed and breakfast recommended this place, and we're thankful he did! We were able to get an outdoor table with no wait even though it's Saturday. The server was very helpful and enthusiastic. We tried the calmar- it wasn't what I was expecting, but the sauce was so good I could have eaten it with a spoon. We both ordered the chicken leg quarter. The chicken was tender, moist, and flavorful. I had medium spice and felt it was just right for me; I'd say it was equivalent to most Thai mild- spice levels (when a no-spice option exists). Overall, this was an excellent vacation dinner."}
{"text":"The menu here is pretty sophisticated for such a casual place (which I love - great food that you don't need to dress up to eat). The people-watching is beyond compare, what an awesome neighborhood. We were told by a Canadian BFF that portugese chicken in Montreal was a must, so can't comment on the taste of the rest of the interesting menu (lots of fish). I had the daily special (quarter chicken mild, fries, salad, Stella Artois IPA for $10.49). DH had the half chicken medium with fries and rice, and a coke. Service was great, friendly (and cute! sorry DH). We waited a bit for the chicken, apparently a shift change inside between lunch and dinner. Really the wait was not terrible, but we got an apology. The chicken was really good - grilled with crisp skin but not charred, tender inside and very flavorful from whatever spice/herb mix they used to marinate/baste. They used a red sauce to add heat, and I found a taste of the medium was pretty hot (and hot enough for DH). They offer hot and \"fuego\" for those who like spicier. The flavor of the sauce was a little like buffalo wing sauce, but it was thicker and spread on top, not doused. The rice was the parboiled style (typical latino restaurant type) and pretty bland, but good against the hot sauce and vinegar from the dressing. The salad was romaine, super-thin sliced red onion (maybe pickled) and olives, with a pleasant vinaigrette. And there was just the right amount, more than a garnish, but not the type that seems to grow in amount as you eat it. I loved the fries, but it would depend on your taste - they were seasoned really well, as to size not shoestring (frites) but thinner than steak fries, and fried crispy but still very moist on the inside. I like that style a lot (pretty greasy), so ymmv. They might have offered ketchup or mayo for the fries, but we didn't need it enough to ask. Server spoke fluent french (as far as I could tell) and english (for sure!). Have no fear if your french is terrible or nonexistent! And seriously, the neighborhood and foot traffic is really chill and interesting. Curbside parking is available on the side streets, or small pay lot around the corner."}
{"text":"Très bonnes grillades portugaises et leurs poulets sont cuits sur charbon, ceux qui leurs donnent une très belle touche originale. Une belle place très chaleureuse et calme. Le service était très bien et le rapport qualité-prix était très bien également."}
{"text":"Medicore.... Dried out chicken, cold chorizo, boring salad with limpy lettuce. All i can say is dont bother!"}
