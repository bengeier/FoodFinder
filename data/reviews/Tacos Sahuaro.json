{"text":"This place is awesome. Yes, it's a hole in the wall, but the tacos and quesadillas are amazing. The service is also good; they bring out a tray with salsas, spicy carrots, cucumbers and limes to every table. Plus the tortillas are pretty much the best in the entire world.. So yummy."}
{"text":"Great little Tacos shops!!!! Very clean and friendly and the taco prices are great!!! And the size and flavors and quality are some of the best in town. I will be back thanks"}
{"text":"First time there after finding them with yelp.  Tried the street tacos they were good not the best I have had but still very good and the price is right.  The cute young lady taking orders was very personable and helpful and lead us to what we should try first."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance - no, but the best damn tacos in the city (and this is phoenix people) and that says a lot. Did take CC."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food! The burritos are amazing and tacos are phenomenal. They are extremely affordable too! I mean $2 street tacos every day, you can't beat that. They make all of their juices too, pineapple, horchata, etc..."}
{"text":"Best carne asada tacos in AZ! Good spicy salsa and they have really good refried beans"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try since it got very high marks on Yelp. I have been disappointed with the lack of good Mexican in Phoenix since moving here from California three years ago. This place gets my highest recommendation. We had the tacos and tostadas and everything was great and the service was also very good. I will be visiting this place very soon for more tacos."}
{"text":"The best carne asada tacos I've ever had!  Delicious!!  I had the al pastor tacos too... They were good... Kinda had a lot of fat though.  I should've gotten all carne asada.  I asked for guacamole on the side, but I got slices of avocado instead.  The beans were great too!"}
{"text":"While I do not have a pic to share, the tacos here are the truth! 

The Mr. and I decided to try something new last night for Taco Tuesday last night, which landed us at this spot. Located on a busy street, this place serves up some delicious grub.

The service here was great. The young lady at the counter was helpful in menu options and patient with explaining them. It's apparent that it is family owned and operated; something one could appreciate. Small and original. You can tell that its been there forever. The place is old but they keep it clean. 

We ordered Carne Asada and Chicken tacos. The meats were very well seasoned on both. Each tortilla was grilled to perfection and filled from edge to edge with meat, onions and cilantro. Everything tasted homemade. The side carrots and jalapeños are pickled in-house and were absolutely delicious! The red salsa was tasty but a little too hot for my tongue; Mr. B. loved it. I prefer the green chile salsa as it added additional flavor to my chicken tacos. We took our order to go and arrived home to food that was still pipping hot (huge plus).

We will definitely come back and try other options. If you're in the area, Tacos Sahuaro is a place you won't be disappointed in."}
{"text":"Sopes, Gorditas, and Tacos are soooo goood!!!"}
{"text":"Got word they take credit/debit cards now. Super great place to eat in Phoenix and will always visit when I'm in town"}
{"text":"The tacos here are absolutely fantastic!  The prices are very economical and the staff is always very friendly.  They have very special corn tortillas that remind me of the ones I had in Cabo San Lucas that were hand made right before my eyes.  I highly recommend this place.  It doesn't look like much from the outside or when you go inside, but don't let that keep you from enjoying the authentic food they sell!"}
{"text":"Place is delicious! The tortillas are definitely authentic. The only reason for 4 stars is it's a little pricy but at least it's worth it."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a nice taco spot in Phoenix for the past three years and I've finally found it! The service was awesome and the food was quick. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food, freshly prepared. Ambiance is very low key. Large picnic style tables with plastic tablecloths and a TV with Spanish programming in the corner. A cute Mexican family was having a post-church lunch during my visit."}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten at this place has been incredibly delicious. The sopes are my personal favorite, with heaps of fresh ingredients and the crunchiest base. The staff is extremely warm and efficient. If I lived a little closer I would eat here every single night!"}
{"text":"Very tasty tacos. Tostadas and sopes are better. Their chorizo is great.
Expect very slow service. My wife and I usually stop in, order to go, go to the store and grab something to drink or whatever the other person wants for dinner, then we head back. Usually, the food still isn't ready. Prices are good. The inside is very unassuming. The selection of sodas is minimal at times.
The only thing bad I can say about the place is that you really have to order everything you want at once. No ordering one or two tacos and then one or two more, they're just not quick enough."}
{"text":"Friendly service! Tortillas are made at the restaurant which is awesome. The tacos were delicious! Must try"}
{"text":"Humble Building with Amazing Food & Customer Service! I'm a native from AZ and this is truly the best Mexican food I've ever had here to Cali. Friends and fam also agree. Highly recommend the carne asada tacos with a side of rice and beans. Once you have it you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"[Edit]
I'm downgrading this establishment after the bullsh!t I went through today.
I've been frequenting this place on a regular basis. I love the tacos. However, as I stated, they charge .50 cents per credit card transaction (which is already a bunch of bull).
I placed my order and saw they had fresh pineapple juice.
I asked to add that to my order but instead of adding the juice to my order she charged me two different transactions on my card!
I told her it was a bad move but she didn't care and gave me some BS about the cost and blah, blah, blah.
Taking cards is the cost of doing business.
Don't think I'll be going back.
Sucks because they do make good tacos but I'm a stickler for service and fairness."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and we all ordered Carne asada burrito. Food was plain and overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"The tacos al pastor were incredible, and the place definitely has \"authentic\" written all over it, but the sope and the tostadas with carne left something to be desired."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week. Best tacos I've ever had! Who cares if it's a little dive-y? The best places are!"}
{"text":"íMuy Delicioso!  My Buddy and I were looking for a post-workout meal to enjoy with the underlining reason being that it was Tuesday.  As any good hungry person would think, Taco Tuesday.  We found Tacos Sahuaro and noticed that Yelpers loved this place.  We came and it definitely had the look of an awesome hole-in-the-wall taco shop which gave me a sense of ease and excitement.  I decided to get 4 tacos, even though the quesadilla and the tortas looked awesome.  I was sad to hear they were out of the pollo asado, but i take that as it must have just been delicious.  I instead got the Carne Asada, Pastor, Lengua, and Chicharron.  All were just absolutely FANTASTIC!  I was pleased to see that they either fry their tortillas or they're just housemade b/c they were just awesome!  The texture was thicker than usual, but still nice and soft and and just tasted fresh.  I will say that my least favorite of my four was the Chicharron, the reason being was that the skin was not crispy as I had initially expected.  The skin was soft and perhaps I am mistaken that it was supposed to be fried, but that was my reasoning behind that.  The pastor or the lengua were probably my favorite.  The flavors of each are just so distinct and are just on point.  They also have the verde y rojo sauce which are both on point and last but not least they gave us a bowl of limes and cucumbers which enhanced the flavors just that much more.  I will definitely be going back for some delicious Mexican food :) 

¡Salud!"}
{"text":"We saw this place when we stopped in Phoenix for lunch. Oh boy did we like it. The hubby loved their pastor tacos and I loved the catne asada tacos. Small place but great, tasty tacos. 

Don't blame them for not keeping up with demand but their tacos are amazing. They sure know how to make the original tacos. We don't need to drive all the way to Sonora or Tucson anymore.

Regardless of how small the place was, I dont think the size of the business should be considered when rating the expefience as a whole. We are just happy we ate there.

Thumbs up guys!"}
{"text":"I call this place, Little Mexico to my friends and coworkers because it is so authentic.  I've been going there for about a year, mostly because its less than a mile from my work and on my way home.  I've never been disappointed either.  I brought some carne asada tacos and a bowl of beans back from work with me and now all my coworkers are addicted.
We even did an event with 15 people, so I stopped by the day prior to ask how to handle it.  Just had to call in order early and it was all ready and organized on time.  Great service!
It can be a long wait for your order if they are busy, so just fyi.  Salsa is very spicy, very flavorful!  Great stuff all around.  They now have horchata too.  Haven't tried it yet though."}
{"text":"We ALMOST thought about not going in-- but I'm so glad we did! It's kinda sketchy looking at first (and there weren't a lot of people there) but I LOVED my meal! Whenever I go to a taco place, I always hope for a good fish taco but I'm hard to please. Theirs was really good-- exactly what I was craving. Grilled fish on corn tortillas with lots of lettuce, pico, and cilantro. The seasoning was perfect, and you've gotta have the chile verde sauce on top. I really appreciated that it came out to me steaming hot off the grill-- nothing is worse than barely warm food. Even the complementary carrot slaw was yummy. My husband got the burrito and said it was good-- but didn't rave over his meal as much as I did. On top of it all, the Mexico vs Jamaica soccer game was on which made for a fun atmosphere. If we're back in Phoenix in the future, I'm glad I know where to find good fish tacos!"}
{"text":"I dine here when my budget/diet allows. I think the food has improved in quality lately. I am in serious like of their Burrito, Carne Asada, with avocado and everything. Not too spicy for me (most Arizona residents would probably say not spicy at all)"}
{"text":"Drove all the way down from North Scottsdale to feast on their scrumptious tacos. $2 tacos with freshly chopped onions, cilantro, carrots and lemons on the side. It's a steal. The service is friendly and fast-ish. So, muchas gracias!

I'm glad they're not closer to my house or I'd weigh 300 pounds."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! I would award this place another star if possible! I have not been to a better taco place in AZ! This is not a trendy taco shop. If you are in Phoenix for a few days and you want real Mexican street tacos this should be your destination. When we first walked in, the large drink barrels caught my eye. We got the cucumber water which had lime and kiwi in it... Amazing! The pina was great too. I had the carne asada tacos and pastor tacos. I don't know what the carne asada meat was marinaded in but it had a beautiful caramel flavor. The tortillas were hand made and a little bit crispy. This is my new place! I love it! Wow!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends to have a late night snack cause we saw that it closes at 11 but that is WRONG THEY CLOSE AT 10! The lady was rude we got there at 9:30 she said we are only taking to go orders and she said we can't eat in the restaurant so that was horrible of her! In my whole I have never been denied, in eating at a restaurant that is still open, tacos de apastor are super GREASY!! So if u want food poisoning come here! 

Try at your own risk that's all I have to say"}
{"text":"Best tacos and burritos in the neighborhood. I just saw someone with the torta and it looked amazing. I am definitely trying the torta next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Well, I'm not Mexican but I like their food. And this place is the best!! Just went for lunch and I can't wait to go back (maybe tomorrow). Alberto."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had (carne asada is what I usually get). The horchata is amazing as well. Looks like a big hole in the wall but DONT LET THE OUTSIDE OF THIS PLACE FOOL YOU!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Best carne asado tacos around!! flavorful meat, habanero sauce...and the tortillas! very unique. Nothing like it anywhere else. At least once a week I stop and take some home for dinner (and lunch the next day)."}
{"text":"Hours are wrong on Yelp. Closes an hour earlier then it says. Lame to drive all the way there as Yelp says it's the only open taqueria to be turned away."}
{"text":"El mejor lugar para tacos de lengua muy Rico tardan un poco pero está buenísimo se lo recomiendo a usted que lee esto"}
{"text":"Tacos are okay, better than others I've tried. The salsa is not that good, but the prices are fair. I'll come back."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Tacos Sahuaro I was thinking about the tacos I ate the rest of the day and I had to go back the next day.  I've been going every week since.  The corn tortillas are the best I've ever had. 

They must use black magic to make the tortillas or maybe they fry them in crack.  Whatever it is I don't care there is no better tortilla on the planet. If you come here, and you would be crazy not to, make sure whatever you get has a corn tortilla you won't be disappointed.

The menu is tiny but they will basically make you whatever you ask for.  I always ask for vegetarian tacos (beans, lettuce, tomato, cheese and cilantro).  $2 per taco it doesn't get any better than that. Plus they give you cucumbers, limes, pickled carrots, onions and jalapenos with each order.

p.s. ask for the spicy salsa its pretty spicy but has great depth of flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos! Tried the chicken, beef, and tripe ones and all were excellent! The place is not fancy at all, but it is clean and has been A rated by DOH for the past 2 years. The food took some time, because the kitchen was busy with orders. This was a good sign!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!! The beans, rice, and pastor tacos were everything I could hope for. Usually a taco place has a miss with one of those staples but not here. They nailed it all! The staff was very friendly and helpful as well. Plus everything was very clean. We will be back until I've overdosed on tacos!"}
{"text":"I really cant say much about a non pretentious, low key hole in the wall that is mostly frequented by a Mexican clientele. This place makes tacos just as good as youll find on a street cart in Mexico. I had the four taco plate, 2 lengua, 1 cabeza and one of chorizo....all were pretty tasty but the cabeza taco stole the show for me. Their homemade salsas were bomb too! Im definitely going back here again!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to AZ (from NY), I come here.  Little hidden gem - food is awesome!!! The area is sketchy at best, but hey... the food is worth it!!! 2 thumbs up

Will be coming again!!!"}
{"text":"The best tacos and tortillas. Definitely one of my favorite places for lunch now!"}
{"text":"Hand made tortillas, sorry took a bite already, gotta eat em while they're hot.  Big horchata and perfect.  You don't come here for the decor, it's the tacos.  Quick service. Employees are polite and nice.  As the employee was bring food to another table. she stopped by and asked if everything was already.  Carnitas and pastor seem to be the best, asada was average. Will return."}
{"text":"This taco shop has a lot of potential, with good service, an extensive  taqueria menu, and some of the best corn tortillas in town.  I just wish that their carne asada meat was more flavorful and not burned to a crisp.  If the meat itself was juicier, better seasoned, and not cooked past medium doneness, the tacos would have been awesome.  Overcooked meat notwithstanding, I would return again because I liked the pleasantness of the staff and the authentic vibe of the food and the space itself, and just hope that the carne is prepared to my liking the second time around.

The corn tortillas, however, were awesome, as they were chewy with the right amount of blackened char and riddled with delicious spots of crispiness.  The salsas were also tasty, with the red sauce in particular being really spicy, even to my heat-accustomed tongue.  

The pollo asada, carnitas, and al pastor tacos were good.  I'll come back and give their carne asado tacos another try."}
{"text":"Good food. As is my usual i order sopes. I asked for not deep fried or fried and they lady at till went back to talk to the chef and returned to the till and told me no problem we can do that. They have fairly good salsas. I dont recall any thing being bad or not tasting good. The sopes were good. They even were nice enough to charge me 1dollar less for the sope as i was not getting any meat. Nor any cheese or cream.I love places like Tacos Sahuaro. No pretencion hole in the wall joints. They are always the best for good food and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is an excellent authentic mexican food restaurant. Their cucumber juice drink taste great.  They are fast serving and great customer service. Highly recommend to go here."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the neighborhood. A friend suggested it for lunch and I was sold. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. The menu is straightforward with basic choices but they are well prepared and presented. The price is economical and you can easily eat here for under $8. I have returned many times with friends and as one stated, \"this is the real deal\". Give them a try!"}
{"text":"This place is great, awesome tacos and let me tell as a Mexican women who cooks everyday and sometime you want a break this is the place I want to go and eat because it's S if I myself was cooking but without the hard work to do it, but lacks in dacore, it makeup in its awesome food and everything is great and the rice and beans well let me tell you, I hate beans and I love there rice and Bens here must go, go"}
{"text":"Best Taco Tuesday spot near my work/house! Very affordable and portions are great size"}
{"text":"I came in, placed my order, which was a total of five tacos. The wait time? 26 minutes from the moment I put my order to the time I received my food. I placed my \"to-go\" order at exactly 10:28 and received it 6 minutes before closing time, at 10:54. Keeping in mind that there weren't many people who were waiting for food.  Now for 5 tacos I paid 14 dollars, averages out to 2.80 a taco which isn't bad, but I can get a better tasting taco at a much faster timing for only two dollars. It wasn't a real satisfying visit, in all honestly this is definitely not my first choice. It's not horrible, but it's not great either"}
{"text":"Location is sketchy,but service is always GREAT! And so is the food!
 Dining in is a good idea so that your tortillas do not get soggy, but they wrap the food up well for take-out so it keeps warm! Their salsas are so delicious! I recommend the sopes with cabeza and the tacos with any type of meat! Don't be afraid! Try their entire selection of meats! njoy!"}
{"text":"I got 4 tacos: carne asada, pollo, carnitas, and pastor. The carne asada and pollo had great flavor, the carnitas with a nice crisp. The pastor, I'm used to it being fatty and savory- this one is a little on the sweeter end from the pineapple but still quite good. The best part about this place is the toasted, handmade tortillas! The cucumber water is also a must try."}
{"text":"I've only had their chicken and it makes me not want chicken from anywhere else because theirs is THAT GOOD. Seriously, it's the best chicken burrito I've ever had. Get it. Today. For lunch. They close at 10pm Mon-Thurs though"}
{"text":"This is my go to taco spot in the Phoenix area! My boyfriend and I love Mexican food, and have been to several places to try to find the best place. Search over-we found it! The employees are always so sweet and get our food to us in a timely manner. The food is always made fresh, and not over priced! Definitely deserve the 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place has one of the best bean and cheese burritos you could get. Very good food. Authentic tasting. Friendly staff. Feel like a community. The only thing I didn't like was the lingua tacos. Too weird."}
{"text":"Tacos Sahuayo is a casual small shop with great food and a casual atmosphere. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, one carne asada taco, and one chorizo taco. All of them were amazing and I left rubbing my belly in a food coma. 

There was a chili hot sauce served on the side which reminded me a bit of harissa. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but it I wanted to put it on everything. The service was great and I'll certainly stop again if I come back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"The best carne asada tacos I have had in the valley so far. I frequently eat here and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"I am always down to have a taco, burrito or anything Mexican like.  Our last night in Phoenix and we wanted Mexican food.  We stayed way too long at the bar in our hotel and it was getting pretty late since we had to wake up at 5 to board our plane back to Seattle.  
My husband found this restaurant on yelp and we made the 5 minute drive to a very sketchy and dark building.  One reviewer indicated that you would miss the building since it doesn't have an actual sign.  They didn't lie.  I had my gps so I was looking for it but you can easily pass this place up in the dark or light.  Let's be honest, this area is not the best but who cares as long as the food is good and your car isn't stolen when you leave out the restaurant.  There is not a waitress so you look at the board and present your order like Burger King.  Please note that board on the wall has different items than the paper on the counter.  I had my order all ready (lengua burrito and a cabeza taco) but when I got to the counter, the paper had some other items to choose from.  I ended up with the lengua burrito, cabeza taco and a chicharron taco.
My husband ordered chorizo taco and the carne asada burrito.  The food came out quick and looked good.  My burrito was pretty small but filling.  The ratio of meat to other ingredients wasn't bad.  I wish I had said no beans (which I usually do) but it was too late.  The beans overpower the delicate lengua.  The chicharron taco was ok.  Sometimes, chicharron gets cold pretty quick so that was the issue.  The cabeza was pretty good too.  Overall, a good taco shop.  It is the best, hecky no.  Is it better than anything in Seattle?  That would be a yes.  
The only downside would be the Sangria.  It came from a bottle and it was pretty horrible.  Why I did that to myself, I still don't know."}
{"text":"Best place in AZ family owned and operator very awesome people food always and delicious. Must come and enjoy their food!!"}
{"text":"Excellent handmade tortillas. Had the menudo and that was bomb. For authentic Mexican food come here and bring the whole familia, there's plenty of room for everyone.

Tortillas bien sabrosas hechas a pura mano. Menudo excellente. Triagan a toda la familia, hay lugar para todos."}
{"text":"Extremely authentic and delicious!  It is a hole in the wall, but that is all part of the charm.  This is the best Mexican food in AZ, hands down.  As a bonus, it is dirt cheap."}
{"text":"Excellent food for the money - steak racks were tasty, the service was genuine, and the beans were a bit of a letdown. Will come again."}
{"text":"The best tacos I have ever ever eaten! Definitely worth a trip.  I would have paid triple. Sooooo good."}
{"text":"Always great service & food! I've ordered the tostadas, chicken tacos, quesadillas, and everything is very tasty! They give you fresh salsa, cut up cucumbers, and jalapenos with carrots with your order. The location from the outside looks a little sketchy but it's nice inside, & clean. The prices are good."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they opened and the food has always been up to par. Whenever we want quick Mexican food that actually tastes like its from Mexico (not taco bell) we come here. For a long time they would only accept cash but a while ago just started accepting payments from debit/credit cards (50 cents per transaction). They have a bunch of different Jarrito (a Mexican soft drink) flavors you can choose from and or agua frescas."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than Tacos Sahuaro. Tacos de carne asada, lengua or cabeza... you name it, they've got it. Sopes are to die for. And the menudo is just like grandma made it.  We're here all the time and we've never had a bad meal. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Located on the NW corner of Oak and 32nd St.  Cash only.  Straight dive taco joint.  Dirt parking lot and stating the inside is basic is an understatement.  The floor is tore up, the walls are a yellow painted wood paneling, the ceiling looks patched together, there are random tables and chairs.  Some are plastic Costco picnic type, others look like random wood tables and chairs someone donated.  If your kids opened a taco stand with left over furniture you had in your garage this is what it would look like.  There is a flat screen in the corner and a donated looking wall unit displaying sodas next to it.

The menu is pretty basic.  Tacos, tortas, burros, etc with meat options such as, al pastor, carne, pollo, carnitas, chorizo, lengua, cabeza, etc.  I ordered 5 tacos to cover all the bases and get a feel for the flavors and execution.  

First I had the al pastor.  The tacos were a good handful.  Not an extraordinary amount of meat but they filled the tortilla well.  The tortilla was crisped up a bit and while being soft corn they cook gave it a nice crunchy texture.  The al pastor was hot and freshly heated.  The seasoning was lackluster.  It was hard to tell it was actually al pastor by taste alone without looking at it.  Next I tried the carne asada.  The meat was very dark colored and had been reheated more than once.  The chorizo was third.  Good flavor and excellent chorizo.  Slightly on the salty side but the best meat of them all.  The pollo was good straight forward simple grilled chicken.  The carnitas was last and probably my least favorite.  Very bland, dry, and needed a tremendous amount of salsa and lime to throw back.  

Flavor wise everything tasted reheated and the seasonings were a bit dull.  I put lime and continuously applied salsa.  The salsa was tasty.  Especially the orange one.  Nice heat and balance and I would have eaten it on anything that came out of the kitchen.  The crisped tortilla shells were the highlight of the meal.  They were crunchy and pliable.  The young lady at the counter was very nice and provided good quick service.  Price wise the tacos were $2 dollars each.  While I wouldn't give it a second thought other than to mention it in the review we aren't talking about a great value here.

I would recommend a make over of the inside.  If you are going to use cheap tables at least make them uniform and a splash of paint on the walls and making the ceiling one solid texture would do wonders.  I would trash the dusty candy stands, throwback wall unit the sodas are displayed on, and the other tube tv in the far corner.  Put some covers on the lights and tone down the volume on the tv.  Foodwise, I would make the meat fresh to order.  I realize thats not possible with carnitas and al pastor, but it is for chorizo, carne, and pollo.  For the other two I would add more seasoning and at minimum make fresh once a day.  

I probably wouldn't come back again but still feel it's worth a try if you are nearby.  Best of luck."}
{"text":"Loved it! This place is very authentic, humble, and most important: DELICIOUS!!!! Looks can be deceiving, please don't get scared of the simple looks and may I even say \"ghetto\" vibe & looks... This place serves a great portion of food, very clean food and staff.  Oh, staff is very polite, very attentive.  Def will be going back for more:)"}
{"text":"Excellent tasting food. If in the area I have to stop and eat here. I like everthing on the menu the carne asada tacos are the best. Not pricey."}
{"text":"Best tacos in my time here in Arizona. These aren't your taco Tuesday tacos, but they are at a Taco Tuesday price. All tacos are 2 bucks all day every day. The place was empty at noon midweek and you order at the counter and the cute counter girl brings you the tacos and a green and smoky red sauce with a kick in a cold squirt bottle. These are way above normal drive-through salsa taste and leave a great aftertaste. The Carne Asada tacos were stuffed pretty nicely with meat (onions and cilantro are your choice) and the tortillas were griddled and laid down double so nothing ever fell apart. I started with two and had to return for dos more. English is spoken here, but all the customers that day were of the Mexican origin. The counter girl was very sweet, even pointing out some cilantro on my face as I ordered for the second time. Now that is good service."}
{"text":"Came here for taco Tuesday for $2 tacos and I really wanted to love this place.  I think my problem was taking the tacos to go.  I ordered 1 carne asada and 2 al pastor.  I didn't love the tortillas at all.  The carne Asada was delicious but for some reason I wasn't loving the al pastor and that's usually my all time favorite!  I ended up only eating 1 taco and the rest I just couldn't. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Literally my favorite Tacos in Phoenix! Great size, crispy tortillas and fantastic salsas. Love the fresh veggies too!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend to go here, and defiantly a good find! A variety of taco flavor options and at $2.50/each cant beat the price for the size. Four juice options and other menu items asides from tacos. Some of the best street tacos for sure! Private parking lot in the rear and ample seating."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE!!!!!  I live down the street and have driven by it for years!  Today we stopped in.  Boy are we glad we did!
Coincidentally it was taco Tuesday!  Tacos were amazing!  All meat chopped small (as they are supposed to be) sauces were delish and sneaky with the heat.. beware!  Service was friendly and girl at counter helped with our decisions.. this place was squeaky clean too!  Cute atmosphere! I usually gauge Mexican spots by their beans...these did not disappoint! All of the food could not have been more authentic!
We finally found our favorite Mexican food spot!  Do yourself a favor and stop in!
Thank you for putting so much love in your food.. it really shines through!"}
{"text":"Ordered 6 little asada tacos to go took forever to get waited at least 30 mins. Tacos were just okay nothing special"}
{"text":"I agree with everything the previous review said. This place is as authentic as it gets on this side of the border. My regular order is two tacos al pastor and a manzanita. The people here are friendly and helpful. They used to be open until 3am on the weekends but I think that has changed. 

They also operate a food truck on McDowell between 24th and 32nd Street on the North side of McDowell."}
{"text":"Great tacos, gorditas, and tortas 
Loved all the salsas 
The resturant appearance will fool you but the Flavors are all there. Delicious"}
{"text":"It was a Saturday and I also learned that it was National Taco Day, so I thought I'd come here after reading the reviews. I came way after the lunch hour to make sure that there would be a place to park, as I had seen in a Google map street view that parking in front of the eatery is extremely limited. The interior of the place is clean and very basic, with two big-screen TVs on each end of the dining area showing some variety shows. I ordered asada, lengua, carnitas, and pastor tacos and a glass of horchata to wash it all down. The tacos were mostly OK, though one of them had a \"reheated meat\" taste. The cool cucumber slices and pickled carrots on the side were a nice touch. The horchata was pretty standard but refreshing. As is typical of most street taco places, the food was very inexpensive. I do not regret coming here but I would prefer to go to other street taco places next time the taco craving hits."}
{"text":"After reading the yelp reviews I expected some really amazing tacos. The quality of the carne in my tacos was not very good. The Carne Asada tasted dry and old and the Pastor was very greasy. They serve this very spicy delicious chili powder paste on the side that is so good. I think I will go back and try something else next time."}
{"text":"A hidden gem.  Without a doubt, the best street tacos in Phoenix.  

 I usually don't go for street tacos because that's just code for baby sized tortillas with skimpy fillings.  Not so!  Small (not tiny) tortillas come loaded with the good stuff.  Fresh toppings and your choice of meats-- asada, carnitas, and many more.  

They do chicken right.  I can't remember the last time I had chicken at a Mexican restaurant that wasn't that plain boiled shredded white meat.  This place serves chicken chunks crisped up on a griddle and lots of seasoning and a hint of lemon.  You can mix and match your tacos, and four tacos makes a big meal.

The burritos have the same meat choices.  Great tortillas again.  Another bonus is that the burros aren't massive- hear me out.  A burro is supposed to be hand-held food.  When it's so overstuff it splits apart or squirts out, you're making eating harded.   These are very well crafted-- good shape, size and ratio.  Not too much tortilla (I'm looking at you Azteca), not too much stuffing (Rito's).  Plus, the price is right you can just get two burros and still be out the door for $10.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating of gringos like myself.  Open late.  Alas, no breakfast burros."}
{"text":"This is the place for the real thing, not gussied up for foodies!! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"If you were to do some sort of criminal mapping of my eating habits you could probably figure out via some simple deduction where I work. This is mostly due to eating at places around where I conduct business. And when I find a good place to eat, a truly consistent experience, I go there a lot. This is one such place.

Don't be afraid. The lack of windows and barely there front door are a little intimidating at first but keep pushing through that fear. Once inside, don't let the mixed combination of collapsible Lifetime chairs with the wood chairs your grandparents used to own intimidate you. Also, the air conditioner on the wall's drain tube has always been routed down the wall down to well, I don't know where. Also, I hope you like Spanish soap operas because if you go for lunch that is the only thing you are about to watch on the circa 1990's rear projection television in the corner. Pleasantries aside, let's get to the food. 

As you have probably already deduced, this is Mexican food. And good Mexican food at that. You can choose from several different offerings such as your standard tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. There are many other offerings such as tacos de Pastor and gorditas as well but I will concentrate on my favorites; tacos, burritos, and quesadilla. I am a basic man that likes to try everything on the menu once and the stick with what really grabs me. The real basic here is that the carne asada is brilliant and the chicken is not far behind. The carne asada is chipped small, spiced perfectly, and has just a little bit of grease left on it. The chicken is a little charred from the grill, also perfectly spiced, and I am pretty sure picks up a little of the carne asada's grease. This isn't a bad thing. Just pick one of these two proteins and the rest takes care of it self. In tacos they are accompanied by wonderful cilantro, pico de gallo, and creamy crumbled cheese. In the burrito you can choose from beans, rice, the same pico de gallo, or whatever normal filler you are used to such as sour cream or guacamole. I always get a mini or full size quesadilla in addition to the tacos or burrito because they are wonderfully cooked and immensely savory. The flavor is not like anything that I really can compare it too. They are unique. No real wetness that you get from some places where it drips out the bottom of the tortilla. Not here. It's always hot and it's always good. Consistency is really the last word at Taco Sahuaro.

I wouldn't be painting the full picture if I didn't mention the rest of the experience. Sit down where you like after ordering food and soon you will be served a bowl of limes, radishes, pickled carrots, and what I can only deduce is some sort of sustained lava compound to be applied to your taco, burrito, whatnot when it arrives. I tasted the lava compound once. Once. You will also get two squeeze bottles for green and red sauce each of which is tasty and a little warmer than I typically like. Used sparingly, I find it a good accompaniment to the main dish. You can also get those wonderful, sugary authentic Mexican Cokes that are becoming more and more ubiquitous around town. The staff is as friendly as they can be while running around making sure everyone gets their food hot and fresh.

All in all, I would recommend Taco Sahuaro. I have been here quite a bit and that is because when no one can decide on where to go, the easy choice is Taco Sahuaro because it is a known quantity. It is going to be hot, fresh, and delicious. It has never failed on this task so it will be in the rotation for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Simple, authentic, and fantastic. These were the best tacos I have had in Arizona and better than all but a few I've encountered in Mexico. The meat was tasty and the cilantro was plentiful, but the real stand out was the flawlessly crisped tortillas. Tortillas tend to be an afterthought, but these were exceptional. You order from the counter and the food and condiments are delivered to wherever you sit (which was a pleasant surprise). It's a foam plate and plastic seats kind of place.  This is across town for me, but I will be sure to return."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in town!! Small spot but feels like your downtown in a town in Mexico. Great salsa if it don't make you sweat and have a runny nose it's not good. Enjoyed it and will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for great food, friendly service, and great value then this is your place! There is one word to describe this place, yummy!"}
{"text":"We arrived at Sky Harbor late and wanted authentic Mexican food. Found TS. Summary: Ate there everyday while we were there for spring baseball, even though at times it was 20-ish mins out of our way, or late in evening.  We are from So Cal and know great Mexican food. If only it were here, it would be our daily stop. The authentic beverages are excellent, as well. Cannot wait for next March, when we can fit in a little baseball w our fav Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"We got the pastor burrito and 3 tacos - pastor, asada and carnita.  

The food definitely tastes more authentic.  They also give you sliced radish, cucumber, lemons, and pickled carrots to accompany your meal.  The sauces they have are delicious as well - I liked the darker one in the squeeze bottle but needed the stuff they gave us in a bowl for heat.  

I'm not positive that it was asada, but one of the tacos was particularly amazing.  Definitely the best carne asada I've ever had (if that's what it is).  The flavor is complex without being salty.  Its awesome.

Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"The Carne Asada and Pastor street tacos are great sitting on a yummy flour tortilla. The carne asada is a little overcooked but still flavorful. We also tried the mini carne asada quesadilla which was also great and a perfect size! I do wish they had a better salsa selection to accommodate the flavors a little better. 

If you live in the area, I would recommend a to-go order as this place has a certain smell to it, although the service for dining-in was great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I am always on the hunt for good Mexican food and this place is the best. Everything on the menu is delicious and it's always consistent.  It's is simple authentic Mexican food that is good quality and delicious. I have taken family and co-workers here and they all agree that its the best they've had."}
{"text":"The BEST tacos! My sister co-worker told her and now this is my spot. I absolutely love and recommend this place. Truly authentic Mexican food. The Carne Asada and Carnitas tacos are my fav but everything is great here. And don't let me forget the salsa-amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great Mexican food. My son, who is a very picky eater, absolutely loved the carne asada!!! The staff is friendly and the food comes out in a timely manner. We will be returning soon."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Mexican restaurant the food is excellent and the service is as well! Today I asked for a order of chips and salsa they looked at me like I was some sort of gringo but came through by frying up a couple of tortillas and serving it with there yummy salsas no charge the tostadas are the best"}
{"text":"Awesome for the street taco category.  The Pastor was mind-blowing and the gorditas are just next level."}
{"text":"The carne asada was good. But the best was the al pastor. The gorditas are to die for. Reasonably priced and the service was excellent. It's in the hood but great spot taco Tuesday and taco any day."}
{"text":"One of the more authentic Mexican food places around, smells and feels just like your nana's kitchen! Good tacos, their salsas have a kick and the portions are hefty. It's been a while since I've dropped in, might need my carnitas fix soon."}
{"text":"Oh man I love these tacos. Easily these are my favorite, best I've ever had. If I were allergic to corn, beef, onion, and cilantro, and I broke out in hives every time I had one of these, then it would still be a hard choice. I would probably still eat the tacos at least once a week. Hopefully this gives a good clear picture of what the tacos mean to me."}
{"text":"Great old school presentation.  Had the lengua, cabeza, and chicharrones tacos.  The salsa bar is also great.  Spoonfulls of pico de galleo and the smooth silky guac on the tacos made for a great experience.  If your in the area and wondering if you should try it I'd definitely say stop in."}
{"text":"Coming from California, I had hoped that I'd find a good Mexican spot. After many failed attempts, I found this place and took 1st. My only complaint is that they don't have chips and salsa, which is a must."}
{"text":"We're from Cali and looked up a good taco place. I'm so glad we came here. Gorditas and tostadas are delicious! Tacos are a good size and the aguas are very tasty. My favorite was the cucumber lemon chia water! If we are ever in Phoenix, definitely coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype. I tried every taco they had, all were amazing. They were jamming some Mexican soap opera on the two TVs while I waited for my food which was new for me. I ordered seven of those bad boys and plowed through them like they were my last meal on death row."}
{"text":"Eating out while trying to count carbs and calories is not easy. I came here today to roll the dice, and it was a win for sure. I asked for a combination plate with just chicken and veggies. They made me a great meal, and we're super kind. 
I'll be back again."}
{"text":"This place is a dive, in the best sense of the word.  Truly basic interior, swamp cooler (you'll fall asleep if you sit at the table under the blower on a summer day) and pretty basic menu, but with treasures that rock - the only thing I've ever tried is the Al Pastor, which is the best I've ever had.  On gorditas, or in any other form, it is awesome.

Cash only, no soda fountain - bottled drinks only (but good selection of Mexican sodas and juices).  Occasionally they have some Horchata brewed, but not very often."}
{"text":"I love this place! Las Gorditas are so darn delicious!!! The tacos are bomb... big tacos, dos tortillas and a lot of meat! The salsas... uff! They are sooo good! Especially the oil one, it is spicy!! (Try it.. well if you are down). The tortas are really good! The menudo and handmade tortillas that come with the menudo & don't forget to add the salsa de aceite.. ohh my! :))
Also, their zanahorias en vinagre are yummy!

Very rare to find great salsas and zanahorias en vinagre!!!"}
{"text":"My goodness. I'm a Tucson transplant and have had a taco-shaped hole in my heart I've desperately been trying to fill since I arrived. Decided to roll the dice here and am so happy I did. I ate here for lunch and came back for dinner a few hours later. It is everything I wanted and more."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had since moving to Phoenix five years ago.   I had the menudo. mmmm.  It was subtly spiced and perfectly cooked. The handmade tortillas were served warm and thick.  My husband loved the carne asada burrito that he got, and he usually makes a face because he thinks everything is under-spiced...but not today!  We also shared a pastor taco and the pork was delicious."}
{"text":"prepare yourself for the best tacos! you'll feel as though someone's nana is cooking these homemade tortillas and amazing food overall. expect a hole-in-the-wall vibe. there are no windows and may seem sketchy from the exterior but i could live here the food is so good! 

$2 amazing tacos 
delicious salsa and tortillas fresh cilantro and onion

doesn't get any better than here."}
{"text":"This is my new fav place! It is definitely a hole in the wall. The menu is a little hard to decipher because it just has the basic item and prices. There are no descriptions or information about what comes on/with each option. The tacos are wonderful! I love the fresh tortillas. I was a little surprised that they only had onions and cilantro on them. I think some guacamole or cheese might make them better, but maybe that is purely an American thing. There is plenty of room and big tables in the dining area... Not the fanciest, but functional. There are a couple of TVs, but they have been on the Spanish channel every time I've gone in. They charge $.50 for credit transactions. There is a sign on the door that is all in Spanish, so I'm not exactly sure what it says, but I think that it is indicating that your car may be towed if you park in the spots designated for the business to the right of Sahuaro Tacos. There is additional parking behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"BEST authentic Tacos ever, highly recommend if you want the real thing. Look for the bright colorful building. Can't miss it..."}
{"text":"Great pastor burritos!   Sketchy from the outside, completely fine inside.  Love the sauces."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp - thank you Yelp!

It is not a place I would go to without the recommendation of others, but yum! I recommend the street tacos! $1.75 each and filling 4 is enough for a man two was more than enough for me! Pollo and pastor for meat (everything is in Spanish so ask questions if you like to know what you are eating. I got a mini quesadilla too but it paled in comparison to the tacos, will eat there again! Super friendly staff, I live supporting small kick butt businesses!"}
{"text":"Tough little place to find if you haven't been there before.  Little odd with no menu except what is written on the walls so it's a little hard to make a decision on what you want when they ask you at the counter for your order. 

On this visit I had the carne asada burrito and my lunch companion had the Carnitas. My lunch companion really enjoyed her dish.  However, the Carne Asada just wasn't very good. The Carne Asada was very small pieces of overcooked beef that lacked flavor and seasoning.  The burrito was a disappointment. 

 Overall, the service was good and the food just fair.."}
{"text":"This is my official Taco spot. The staff are super nice and load up my order even if it's to go! The taco meat is SO good and their tacos are super full! They add all the extras into baggies and plenty of salsa too! I love their tacos so much, I always want some!"}
{"text":"We were just a few miles away from this place, and we were hungry.  Yelp showed good reviews, so we drove over!

First, the parking is tiny.  At least in front.  They say \"more parking in back\", but it's not immediately obvious how to get to the back.  The building is run down.

Inside, the place is a dive.  Not exactly \"dirty\", but not what one would call well-maintained.  On the wall is a small menu,  Actually, the sign is large, but there are only a dozen or so items on it.  The primary choices are \"tacos\" and burritos.  The tacos are soft open tacos, sometimes called \"street tacos\".  Several meats available.  Asada, pastor, lengua, chicken...

I opted for a combination plate which had some decent refried beans, rice, pastor (pork) and asada (beef).  Normally I give a pass on the beans, but these were tastier than most (I got a sample), so I went with it.  The rice was very good.  The meats were served with warm tortillas.  They were simple, but very good.  From what I know this is really authentic fare.  Not Americanized, just what ordinary Mexicans have in their homes.every day.

It's a bit far from my house in the east valley, but this has made the list of places to go when I find myself in Phoenix.

Be warned, it is cash-only here."}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!!
This is a little hole in the wall place but their food is so good!
We ordered a variety of tacos and a quesadilla.
I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"My family spent Memorial Day weekend in Phoenix and happened upon this place by chance.  We loved it.  We got asada, pastor and pollo tacos - all super flavorful and absolutely delicious.  Also very friendly and helpful service.  Five stars for us"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in today for lunch after reading the great reviews and I am so glad I did! It was fantastic! I had 2 carne asada and one el pastor and a side of beans all this for $8! My food came out several minutes later and was piping hot! At first bite I knew I had found a taco joint that I will be coming back to! The tacos were awesome and the beans were super yummy as well. You got a very big portion of beans (easy to share). I know I will certainly be back soon!!!

Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"In search of Tacos de tripas I was guided to Tacos Sahuayo by Yelp. This is not the best looking place but its comfortable the people are nice. The Tacos are even better. I had one of each, un taco de lengua, uno al pastor, uno de cabeza y uno de tripas. They are big and are served on two tortillas along with a bowl with limes, cucumber and radishes. They were delicious!!! Its hard to find a good place that has Tacos de tripas and this is one you must try. (Cash only)"}
{"text":"The most authentic tacos I have had in Phoenix. The restaurant is simple but very clean. Tacos are fresh and tasty, the toppings were amazing! Can't wait to be back to Phoenix and come here again!"}
{"text":"A late night dinner. Elisa's carne asada and al pastor tacos were decent. I got a chicken quesadilla. It was outstanding! Maybe it was the seasoning on the pollo asado, I don't know. All I know is that I wanna eat it again."}
{"text":"If you like street tacos, these are some of the best in town.  This is a hole in the wall taco joint with a limited menu with a major emphasize on the street taco.  I recommend the asada and al pastor tacos, they are both very flavorful.  I ordered 3 tacos at $2.00 ea. and was completely filled up.  Give them a try if you are in the area (Thomas / 32nd St.)"}
{"text":"Sadly I discovered this place because I was taking my recently departed kitty Iggy to the veterinary oncologist across the street.  We would drop our little guy off at the oncologist and kill time eating here.

Phenomenal al pastor and asada.  Best I've tasted since I've moved here from Southern California 2 years ago.  Great selection of Mexican sodas.  Next time I'm trying the sopes.  Yum!

Please open a location near Gilbert!!!!

Also, if you sold XL t-shirts I would have totally bought one."}
{"text":"My coworker told me about this place and, being from Tucson, I've been looking for a good hole-in-the-wall casual (and cheap!) Mexican place.

I was blown away.

FOOD: Simple and amazing. The Carne Asada is seasoned and grilled perfect with little gristle. The best surprise of this place is their beans. They have 100% authentic Mexican style refried pinto beans. The kind that takes hours to make and are epic inside a burrito with all other fresh ingredients combined.

SERVER: They're kind and bring out your drinks, food, and condiments -- even though this kind of place isn't expected to. A casual spot like this I would imagine them calling your order and you coming to get it but they serve you, which is unusual but awesome.

AMBIANCE: It's a hole in the wall, but again, I'm from Tucson (so I'm kinda used to this vibe) and I felt right at home with their old DLP big screen TV in the corner playing Mexican soap operas as you eat. 

Is it the best scenery inside? No. However, the food will teleport your consciousness to whatever version of heaven you prefer, so it really doesn't matter once you take your first bite. Support this place now!"}
{"text":"Love the tacos!! I had the Carne Asada tacos they are so good. I did have them to go and was surprised with all you get with your order. The tortillas are delicious and are not small at all."}
{"text":"I sampled them this past Monday night. One each of a Tripa, Buche, Asado and Chorizo. Buche would be the only thing that left me wanting...lack of taste and texture altogether. The others were yummy. Though using factory-made corn tortillas, they do grill one side into some golden brown char that both seems to strengthen the tortilla as you squeeze it, but adds a nice extra to the taste.  Both house salsas were just meh....one verde and one rojo. I saw no other options, so I just ate most of the tacos without any. 

While not bad, I'd only stop here again due to severe weather. Why? Right around the corner is The Tacos Saguayo coach, at 28th st and MCdowell offering a much better product at the same, or even less cost....with a GREAT house red and green salsa offering...Plus, though seated outside under canopy, you at least get some airflow, sadly lacking inside TS."}
{"text":"Exactly what you would want: tacos at cheap prices with generous portions, flavorful meat options (pastor, asada, pollo, carnitas, tripe, etc)...and so many extras (spicy carrots, 4 different sauces, the works).  Tortillas are handmade!  Sooooo good.  Check out the photos folks have posted.  This is the real deal.  Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Honestly this is a hole in the wall.. The outside and inside would need a makeover, but the carne asada and chorizo tacos are awesome. The taste reminded me of Mexico and the salsa de aceite is delicious but spicy. 2 bucks for each taco and they carry the traditional 1/2 liter Mexican coke."}
{"text":"No need to wait for Taco Tuesday's to come to this spot! Solid, authentic taco joint. Whenever I come here, I order the carne asada, carnitas, and pastor tacos. The tacos are filled with tons of meat and are very tasty, tender and affordable. Ordering 2-3 tacos is a good portion for one person (with a normal appetite) and I also recommend getting a homemade horchata as well! You'll spend less at this taco spot than at Taco Bell and Del Taco and will get tastier food. Plus you'll get a little bit of street cred coming into this authentic Mexican joint. At Taco Bell and Del Taco? You get zero street cred. One more thing - be sure to bring cash, because if you use your credit card there is a convenience charge. And that convenience charge could go towards your future taco fund!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos!! As good as anywhere you would find in Mexico. This place is no-frills, authentic and soooo good. It was our last meal in Arizona and certainly not one to be forgotten!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? The tacos were flat out bad! Small meat portion, dried out meat, flavorless and expensive for what it is. I ordered tripa, asada and lengua. I paid $8.50 for pretty much what tasted like dried out left overs from a week ago. I mush rather pay $4 per taco at Joy Ride any day over this garbage."}
{"text":"Wow this place has really good tacos .,, they owners are really friendly not like other tacoshops that all they care is about taking your money with food that has no flavor."}
{"text":"You know when you walk into a place and you're the only one ordering in English, and they bring your food out on paper and styrofoam plates you know it's going to be good.  And it was amazing!  Stopped in here while traveling and wanted some legit tacos.  2 tacos, a gordita and a tostada later my belly (and wallet) were so happy!  Dinner was around $13 (that included a Horchata).  Can't beat it!  Don't let the exterior and surrounding buildings turn you off, this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Chicken asada tacos were delicious. Looking forward to trying a burrito or gordito next time. Would have loved some chips and salsa also to round out the meal."}
{"text":"Tortillas on fleek. Price is right. Whatever orange stuff is in the bottles is good. Go to there."}
{"text":"Been here before it was good back then and its good now.....they accept Credit/debit cards now with a $.50 fee which is a ok wif me.....nom nom nom....lol"}
{"text":"I tried this. Had the tacos: two carnitas as they were supposed to be popular and one each of beef and tongue. Good serving but All were bland... TA Carbon in Phoenix is still the best especially for lengua as well as Backyard tacos in Mesa."}
{"text":"This place was a real fine! It was yummy fresh and delicious. We tried to go to an authentic restaurant in downtown but the wait was too long so on our way back we hit yelp. Lo and behold we found this gem. I had for chicken tacos. Delicious. Don't expect any chips here, they don't have them. Rather, you get some really fresh vegetables. Which is a nice treat. Cucumber slices to be specific."}
{"text":"I am not at all certain that I could have been more disappointed. I was hoping for a challenger to my very favorite Tacos (Asadero del Norte Sonora) but alas, it was not to be.

Cute, tidy place where at 6 PM on a weeknight, I was the only Customer.

Of the three Tacos I ordered, only one (Carne Asada) was edible and it was good. The other two (Pastor and Chicarrone) had absolutely no taste whosoever and the texture left a great deal to be desired.

Will NOT repeat for another try, too many other alternatives."}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here for the $2.50 tacos and they are soooo good! They're always made to order and the ingredients are super fresh! Treat yourself and I promise you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Whew! This place gets super busy on a Sunday. So busy that some people had to leave to go somewhere else. The inside is a little small so you may have to end up getting your food to go. We came in and ordered takeout which consisted of menudo, a quesadilla, and a Carne Asada burrito. They do not have fountain drinks or ice, and it is bottle or cans only. 

Our order took about a half hour to come out. When we got home the burrito was tender and seasoned very nicely, and it had a nice smokiness to it. The quesadilla was good, but I don't know how anyone could really mess up a quesadilla. A little bit of cilantro on the inside added a nice touch. The menudo had a nice broth with plenty of tripe. I would've preferred a little bit more hominy in it, as it had a lot of tripe, but I guess generally the complaint is that there isn't enough tripe. It came with all of the general fixings: onions, cilantro, red pepper paste, and limes. I look forward to returning here again, but perhaps a bit earlier and maybe not on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Bienvenidos a Tacos Sahuaro - enjoy authentic Mexican street tacos without leaving Phoenix!

The restaurant is nothing fancy, but it has plenty of seating inside and most importantly serves up delicious tacos for only $2 each. The tacos are made with with two freshly cooked tortillas, your choice of meat, chopped onions and cilantro. The tacos are also served with a selection of fresh veggies to cleanse the palate - sliced cucumber, picked carrots, onions, and jalapeños if you want to kick it up a notch. The green chile and red salsa were good, but not the best I've ever had. 

At the suggestion of other Yelpers, I tried the Al Pastor, Carne Asada, and the Carnitas Tacos. The three tacos were quite filling because they come double wrapped in two tortillas. The Carne Asada Taco didn't have a lot of flavor on its own - probably would've been good with some fresh guacamole - but the Al Pastor Taco was delicious! 

Also, if you order a Coca Cola be prepared for \"un medio litro - that's half a liter! They didn't have Horchata when we visited, but they have a wide selection of Jarritos drinks (mango, tamarindo, lime)."}
{"text":"Closest I have had to the real thing.  Excellent!   Love the Pastor but all were good."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews led me here, and they were right: this place rocks. The food was fresh and flavorful and absolutely delicious. The young lady at the counter was friendly and helpful. We kept it simple-- I got the asada tacos and my coworker went pollos. I was tempted to go back up to the counter and order one with carnitas, but I was too stuffed. If time permits while I'm in town, I may swing by again to check out a few more things. I'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the area and craving tacos."}
{"text":"First time here was this week and I'll definitely be back.  Very clean and easy to find.  The menu is primarily tacos, burritos, etc.  Got a combination of the asada and pork tacos.  Both were excellent.  Service was quite friendly."}
{"text":"10/6/2016- Had the BEST fish tacos in East Phx! Lots of fish (fish was grilled - not battered) added with lettuce, tomatoes & cilantro...Yum!! And with the salsas...OMG!! Good!! They have this orange-red salsa... I think it's habanero with chile d arbol. That salsa alone will make U want to go back! Spicy!! Definitely going back!! Happy I work near by!! :)"}
{"text":"Wow sooo good! What a great find! Thanks yelp friends- I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Straight up - this place is a litmus for street tacos.  There is no such thing as not liking this place.  If you don't like the tacos here, you simply don't like street tacos.  Plain and simple.  I recommend trying every single type of taco.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The tacos are so good the service is great and I honestly have nothing bad to say. Everything was delicious down to the rice and beans! It's my new favorite taco spot for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!! The menu is so simple yet so many good options. The the food and Aguas frescas are great and the employees are very polite. The salsas are pretty good, and they have great rice and I always ask for a side of grilled onions which makes it so much better. This has become one of our favorite lunch spots !"}
{"text":"The tacos and gorditas here are so good! We drive from the East Valley several times a month to eat here because the food is so good. They will make you fresh homemade tortillas if you ask. The salsas in the bottles are good. The red has a nice spice to it but isn't too hot. They also give you a salsa in a small dish. Proceed with caution! That stuff is SPICY and it burns later on if you add too much. If I can't eat at my mother in laws, this is definitely my next choice!"}
{"text":"Had the Al pastor Gordita. They hand make the gorditas. It was so good I had to order another one. Its only $4.50 but they arent HUGE. Street tacos are only $2.50 each. My friend had 4  carne asada and he really liked them.This place was very good. Wasnt a fan of any of the hot sauces but loved my gorditas. I would go back even though they are not close to my house AT ALL."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this little hole in the wall taco shop. I've tried the carnitas, al pastor, chicken, and carne asada; the carne in my opinion is by far the best. Its got such a great flavor and the perfect crunchiness. 

The also supply you with plenty of limes, cucumbers, spicy carrots and onion garnish, as well as three different sauces you can add (green, red, and a customizable hot sauce; I.e. the more you stir it up the hotter it is). I definitely suggest adding them all, even the carrots and onions go great on or with the tacos. The tortillas are incredible as well, they're fried just right and super fresh. 

Now for the cons, the neighborhood is a little sketchy and parking can be difficult since theres only one row of parking between the businesses and 32nd St. Its definitely not fancy in any way, but the food is fresh and done well."}
{"text":"I walked in and it was empty, and it looked shady. But I was starving and looking for a good taco. Holy cow, this place was amazing. I had 2 carnitas tacos and two al pastor. The al pastor was ok but the carnitas ones were amazing. Melt in your mouth meat and at the same time had some nice crispy pieces in there. Super good. Staff were very friendly and the service is fast. I have had tacos in Mexico city DF and the carnitas ones here rival the ones from the homeland. Very simple menu, clean, what it makes up in older building looks, it makes up in deliciousness. Must try."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican fast food in Phoenix. Checked in a Radison hotel near Airpor before my morning flight, wanted some real Mexican before heading back east. Found this great place thanks to Yelp
Place is kind of scary outside, but people there super friendly and great authentic mexican tacos. No tex mex here!"}
{"text":"Tacos were good, staff was nice and friendly, I ordered two Tacos al Pastor and small Jamaica all for $7.
Place smelled very bad, like if they cleaned with old rugs or old mop."}
{"text":"Coming from Washington State from a very Mexican culture and then living in LA for 10+ years, I had a very hard time finding authentic tacos in the East Valley (everything is very white washed per say)...until I found Tacos Sahuaro...OMG...BOMB...It's a little far to drive for me but worth it when I get that craving and am too lazy to make them myself."}
{"text":"BOMB ass tacos and I love that it's a small business. They have great service and are so friendly. They have bottled and canned soda which I love. They also have Jarritos which is amazing since they have multiple flavors. 

I didn't get to try anything besides the tacos but I bet it's all amazing!!"}
{"text":"Most authentic Mexican tacos I've found in all of Arizona I was born and raised in Mexico so tend to be pretty picky about my Mexican food and this place is amazing specially their al pastor tacos"}
{"text":"Great authentic tacos for two bucks.  Carne asada were excellent.  Pig skin...May be a inquired taste."}
{"text":"Pretty divey atmosphere, but that's how you know it's good! I had a Torta asada and it was a perfect blend of veggies, meat, and spice. Couldn't ask for better when searching for late(ish) night food in Phoenix. They close at 10."}
{"text":"Delicious, I always get the carne asada tacos and once in a while I'll add a carne asada burrito but have the rice removed and go easy on the beans.  Wish they had fountain soda I stead of cans."}
{"text":"Um . . . OK, we gave this place a shot, but were far less than impressed.

I think they tried to be \"authentic,\" and actually had a few items which could be picked up in \"authentic\" Mexico (sopes, tacos, which were what we ordered), but the taste and the quality were not something which would prompt us to eat there again.

Location is . . . unimposing?  That's one way of putting it.  Another way is it is a bit scary.  Yes, you can order in Spanish.  That doesn't, however, make it a 5-star joint.  Not all that well-maintained . . . much like the surrounding neighborhood.  We came on a Sunday when there was hardly anyone there . . . and we were more than a little nervous parking our car and walking in.

I don't have anything really bad to say about the food . . . I will applaud their effort.  I can safely say, however, that the taste was not of the \"died and gone to heaven\" variety attributed to them by so many of the 5-star reviews they have been awarded.

I would say give them a shot . . . not bad, but not great.  They have menu items other than the regular \"burrito / chimichanga\" fare that so many folks think constitutes \"real\" Mexican cuisine, but not, in my opinion, meriting a special trip."}
{"text":"Physically, this place is not pretty on the eyes but the authenticity and flavors in their food leaves you wanting to order more. 
A great pit stop before a flight or just because.

I recommend the tripa tacos!"}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with their tacos. Definitely not my first choice when it comes to Mexican."}
{"text":"Loved It. Feels like eating Tacos in LA!"}
{"text":"Man Oh Man was this place the FUCKING bomb. The pastor and asada tacos are the da shit i would highly recommend getting those if you ever want amazing tacos. Even better is they are only 2 dollars each can you say WHAT??????? best of both worlds and they are not stingy with their meat. amazing place definitely going back."}
{"text":"Tacos Sahauro has been on my list for awhile now. For the most part, it's your standard taco joint that sort of falls in the middle between the bottom of the barrel cheap tacos and the more upscale joints that keep popping up in Phoenix.

At two dollars a taco, you're actually getting a lot of food. All tacos were heavily packed with meat, which many people probably appreciate. My girlfriend and I tried the asada, pastor, and a chorizo. Additionally, I ordered a bare-bones cheese quesadilla.

Quality of the tortillas and meat is fine, although nothing I'd really call spectacular in comparison to other places. The oil they provided is decent, but insanely spicy, so be very careful. You'll receive plenty of limes and cucumbers without even asking, which should always be a no-brainer regardless. The quesadilla was just kind of bland.

The restaurant itself, even with its air conditioner, is freaking hot! And despite its grade-A cleanliness that people keep mentioning for some reason, their bathroom is anything but. Not that that factors into the quality of the food, of course.

Overall, you can do a lot worse than Sahauro if you're searching for good tacos, but dare I say, you can also do better if you do your research.

In the end, they're okay, but probably not a place we'd return to."}
{"text":"The tacos are delish and legit! The meat is so flavorful and tender. I got the carne asada and carnitas, carne asada was my favorite but carnitas were great too. The reason I took off a star is because the environment is not good, it's pretty dingy and you can spot plenty of dirt around the floorboards, making you wonder a little bit about the cleanliness of the kitchen.... but the tacos are great!"}
{"text":"Bar none, Tacos Sahuaro has the most authentic Mexican tacos I have ever eaten in the states, and I cannot get enough of them!!

Everything about the food and experience at Tacos Sahuaro reminds me of when I go to the family taquerias in Mexico.  When you go in, you order with the cashier by picking your meats and what you want it in (tacos, quesadilla, torta, etc).  You then pick a seat, and a server will bring you a dish of cucumbers, radishes and limes along with 2 salsas and a homemade chili oil to munch on until your food comes out (which is never long).  And let me tell you, everything is lick your lips, kiss the air, and squeal with delight flavorful and delicious!!  My favorite 2 meats are the carne asada and the pastor.  I can't even describe how juicy and tasty they are....you just have to trust me.  Everything comes out piping hot with fresh onions and cilantro on top, and it is utter perfection.  And to note: I'm pretty sure they make their red salsa with spicy crack in it, because I sweat and need more of it every time I go ;)   

If you are looking for a true authentic taco experience, then you better run over to Tacos Sahuaro and get ready to chow down!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and the carne asada burrito is excellent and the portion is very generous for the price.  Also they accompany the meal with pickled carrots, onions, etc. Which is almost a side dish. Overall very happy with the consistent quality here."}
{"text":"Great street tacos.  Warm corn tortillas, filled with a plentiful amount of Carne Asada, with cilantro and onions.  Hot sauce was great.  The hot stuff is REALLY hot though.
It's not in a great area, but don't let that keep you from trying this place.  Also the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place!! Came once alone & had the buche which was okay but also had pastor which was amazing!!! After that brought my whole family of (30) to try this spot and they all loved it !! This is a must try & it's all well priced!!"}
{"text":"Great food! This is the best Mexican food I have had in AZ. I love this place and very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos since I have been here in AZ.  Little dive spot....great service...and the food was delish.  $2 street tacos....packed with meat.  yes...yes...yes!!!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, born in Tucson, we have so many options. Well, I have been to several Phoenix Mexican restaurants, this one is in the top 3 Mexican restaurants I have ever been to. The best in Phoenix by a long shot. The canitas tostada over the top, perfect seasonings. The tacos are great. The Quesada really good. We will be here twice a month at a minimum, did I mention the proudly display their grade A health department score. Great service too. Table side salsa, cucumbers etc. Really need to try this place, we found it on Yelp, ***** all the way!"}
{"text":"This is seriously very authentic Mexican food! Me and my boyfriend are regulars and usually order carne asada tacos, chorizo tacos, sopes, quesadillas, tostadas, or burritos. Those are all super duper good! The salsas are spicy and tasty, just like they're supposed to be! Don't be fooled by the sketchy outer appearance of the building, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food place! The tacos are a nice size ($2) and delicious along with the beans and rice! I've found my new fave little low-key spot!"}
{"text":"I figured I'd like this place based on it's decor lol In TX we look for places like this since they usually have the best tacos. I got 4 tacos: Pastor and Carnitas. The carnitas was a little greasy, but the pastor meat was good. Salsas and escabeche were good. They use lemon here rather than lime, which was a little odd but doable. This is a standard, authentic taco place. They have more on their menu too, but we just got tacos. I will keep on hunting fo the best tacos in Phoenix area, but check this place out"}
{"text":"I came here after reading a lot of good reviews on this website and I'm really glad I did it. For me it's really hard to find good authentic Mexican food because my parents were born and raised in Mexico and my parents and grandmother used to make the best Mexican food which makes it hard to compared to today's restaurants. Especially with the lack of supply for lengua (cow tongue). I was very surprised not only the fact they had that kind of meat, but because it was super delicious! It totally brought back memories of my childhood and the good old days with my grandma cooking me dinner!"}
{"text":"Great taco and burrito restaurant!  Health Dept \"A\"  rating. I'm from Chicago and used to \"burrito as big as your head\".  Stopped for lunch with the family, burrito was top notch, we'll be back alot!  No windows in the place, fine with me...."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, homemade juices, if in the area, can't beat the price $10 for 2 Carne asado tacos, rice & beans & jamaica + relish veggies..."}
{"text":"Great whole in the wall taco place, great food, great service. Try everything is my suggestion, I've had a lot here and haven't had anything bad. This place is definitely place you shouldn't judge by its cover, very divish but definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"This is a real deal Taco shop. It's like you walked  through a wormhole and came out in some rural town in mid Mexico. You order at the counter from a menu on the wall which has been updated several times by just scratching out what they want to change. I recommend the cabeza tacos (cows head), that tastes like the best pot roast you have ever had. Another totally authentic dish they also serve lingua tacos which is cow tongue. No gloppy chedder cheese mostly cotija cheese (the white crumbly kind that looks like feta).  Of course they also have chicken, pork and beef if you prefer.  Pay the lady, cash only of course. Nice selection of mexican style juices including horchata and that hibiscus red stuff or cans of soda. 

Once you sit down the server will bring you carrots, cucumbers and a dish of some fiery hot crushed chili's in oil. Real addicting if you dig hot stuff,and I do. Your order will be brought out.  Worth a try if you are tired of plates of mystery dish put under a salamander to melt the half pound of Cheddar used at so many sad mexican places in phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow! Finally, an authentic taqueria! This hidden gem is worth the trip. Probably not the best place for a first date as the interior leaves a lot to be desired, but the food makes up for it. The have a decent selection of meats and their tortillas are fresh. Two options for salsa, neither too spicy.
Tip: careful when you first get the tacos, that are very hot!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada plate is awesome with fresh chopped onions and cilantro with hand made tortillas... can't go wrong!

Don't forget to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Oh man! Decided to \"take-out\" with the mister on a whim tonight and we are SO glad we did. Talk about a money street taco... We tried the Pollo, Asada, Al Pastor and Chorizo. I probably wouldn't get the chorizo again because there's just something about it for me that feels more 'breakfasty' but it was still great. The salsas were spicy without being overwhelming and I loved the crispy, grilled soft tacos. Not much to look at inside but we will definitely be back for the food. At $2/Taco I would've been fine eating just 2 and 3 1/2 put me over the edge! Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is legit!!! Been here a couple of times for taco Tuesday and have never been disappointed. Today I had a carne asada burrito. No rice or lettuce add avocado, sour cream, and grilled onions. Hands down best burrito I had. The thin layer of beans had flavor which complimented the already flavorful meat. I am picky at Mexican food because I have had great food. So me giving 4 stars means a lot. 

I would have given 5, but the fact they charge to use a credit card is my reason for the deduction. I wasn't aware of this before and never noticed the fee, but today they informed me of it."}
{"text":"Really was expecting a lot more from reading the reviews. The food here is decent, at best, on the day I stopped in. The meats we ordered tasted like they had been reheated when we arrived. The carnitas was dried out. Not fresh. The aguas were excellent. The service was great. The place was clean and cool."}
{"text":"Fast. Fresh. Friendly. And FABULOUS. Just happened across this gem while shopping and ruining errands on a Saturday afternoon. Don't let the neighborhood deceive you. The food was excellent, the restaurant was clean, and the staff was very friendly. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"If you want great carne asada and pastor tacos in an authentic Mexican environment, this place is everything you are looking for. The tacos are good and cheap. They come with two kinds of salsa, chili paste, fresh cucumbers, pickled carrots and onions and fresh limes. So good."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos and great menudo.  The pork is phenomenal.

If you want some tacos, come here."}
{"text":"Last dinner in town before heading back to Seattle and we were looking for a place that was quick and nearby.  This is the place!

They have tortas, tacos, burritos, quesadillas and so on.

I had their chorizo taco and carne asada quesadilla and they were seasoned well and done perfectly.  Especially, the carne asada, it was moist, flavorful, all-around good with a little kick.  My wife had their burrito and taco in head and lengua meat and she liked hers.

I also had a Mexican bottle Coke which is always refreshing and good.  My wife's sangria out of the bottle drink was not good; we thought they made their own sangria.

If only Seattle had good Mexican food. (sighs)"}
{"text":"Wow! Everything here is excellent. I came with my family and we all got something different. There were tostadas, quesadillas and tacos on the table and every single one of our meals was delicious.

The flavor was great on my pastor quesadilla. It wasn't fatty and greasy like many quesadillas I've had. Instead it was subtle and sweet and citrus-y. I often grow bored of quesadillas after a few bites, but this one made me wish I had ordered two. The pickled vegetables and salsa that come with the meal are a perfect compliment to the delicious plates. 

Tip. Bathrooms have no AC"}
{"text":"Ugg!! I hate to do this but I have to. Sitting there, enjoying my second trip here and second plate of tacos I saw the unthinkable. A live cockroach cruising on the floor. I thought to myself, ok, it's possible, it may just be a fluke. I decided to finish my taco with a grossed out feeling. As my girlfriend was wrapping up her meal, she says \"look babe; there's a cockroach.\" This roach was a different roach in obviously in a different location. 

I hate to leave a sour review on good food but I cannot help it. I can only imagine when this place closes at night and the lights are off, how many more are grazing the pastures. I won't be back and someone may need to check into this place in regards to rodents and insects. GROSS!"}
{"text":"Don't let the neighborhood deter you from coming to this diamond in the rough. Tacos are fresh and tasty. I live in Scottsdale and struggle to find a legit taqueria that's not on the west side. Well look no further because Tacos Sahuaro will save you the trip. Did I mention I work a mile from here? This maybe my go to lunch spot from now on. It's that good. I think I might have cried tears of joy as I scarfed these bad boys down. 

You walk in and there's a menu board with their offerings. Not a huge selection, but that doesn't matter when all you want is a taco. Screw Taco Tuesday. Fridays are where it is. ANYWAYS. I can't remember what else is on the menu because I was mesmerized by the selection of meats. I got my usual...  

I ordered 4 tacos because I love to eat. Was it necessary? Absolutely. I got carne asada, pollo asado, carnitas and cabeza (i.e. Brain). I also ordered a Jamaica cuz it's my fave. They had horchata and another fruit agua fresca. 

Once you order you take a seat where ever. They will bring you a red and green salsa, a pasty looking red salsa in a baby molcajete (danger zone heat in that sucker), and then sliced cucumbers, radishes and lemon wedges in a bigger molcajete. 

Then the moment I was waiting for arrived...taco time! The corn tortillas look homemade. Not sure if they are but they were delish. I topped my first taco with the green salsa and a squeeze of lemon and proceeded to take a bite. Love at first taste. It got progressively better after the first one. 

So if you're on the fence about this place, don't be. It's legit."}
{"text":"So far best tacos i have found in phoenix 

Been coming here weekly since I found it 

Coming from san diego I was really surprised to find that most of the taco shops here are mostly mediocre or plain suck!

I was excited to find this place even though the waits can be long its worth it they always have homemade fresh frescas to choose from melon, horchata, lime, etc....

I have tried the tacos, gorditas, quesadillas, and sopes all GOOD

The bad is the place is a little older, the wait can take some time and the chicharron taco is not like any I have ever had.  All worth it because they are way better than abythibg else I have had in Phx.

Now all i need to find is a place with adobada cut off the revolving spigot. Where are you?"}
{"text":"High quality authentic Mexican food. Their hot sauce is the jam. Be prepared to sweat through your eyelids if you're not sensible about the quantities that you place on your tacos which I most certainly am not. They also have pickled and spiced veggies to help cleanse your pallet. I haven't tried their burritos because I love tacos but I'm sure they're good."}
{"text":"They have some good food here! Ordered the mini quesadilla with al pastor, two carne asada tacos and a large agua de pepino. Mini quesadilla was great, not too greasy. The carne asada had good flavor but the taco shells were a little too greasy. The agua de pepino was spot on. The red salsa is the better of the two. 

Staff was nice and quick. Ordered my food to go and it probably took them 5 minutes to get my food. There were two parties that ordered before me. They gave me four salsas and a baggie of carrots, jalapeños, lines and cucumbers. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Finally getting closer! This place had a great variety of meats for their authentic stule tacos! I tried buche, asada, pastor, and lengua. All were great. I also tried a chicharron gordita which was the favorite thing I had. The tortillas are a bit greasy so be prepared for that.(Maybe ask them to warm them up without oil if you prefer that). Overall this place was good. I loved that they bring you veggies to your table, including limes, cucumbers, and pickled carrots/onions. Great place with authentic Mexican tacos!"}
{"text":"It is easy to say this is one of the best taco shops in Phoenix. Trust me I've been to many around the valley. I order the asada tacos and asada gordita and they were good to the last bite. I will be recommending this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try something new for lunch. I found that I was quite satisfied to say the least. Best tacos I've had in a while (carne asada).  I'm sure my coworkers and I are going to be in here a lot now!"}
{"text":"One of my co workers introduced me to this place about 3 years ago.. it's a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant.. I always order their carne asada tacos with onions and cilantro's on top.. their menu is basic, they have tacos, burritos, tostadas, chili relleno  to name a few..  they only accept cash to keep their prices low so come prepared.. and their parking lot is limited.."}
{"text":"This place is the best hole in the wall place to eat tacos!! The tacos are awesome. The gorditas are amazing too. Loved it! The cucumber water is a must try!"}
{"text":"delicious carne Asada beans and rice, got the burrito with cheese and a 1/2 liter Mexican coke for 8.50 well worth it. cash only, parking in back, you'll know you're at the right parking lot in back when you see the Mexican Coke bottles."}
{"text":"Real Mexican food.  REAL.  I ordered en Espanol.  

Street style tacos:  Handmade tortillas, deliciously seasoned meats (listed below), onions, cilantro, lemons, salsas, radishes and pickled jalapenos on the side.

Gordita:  Like a tostada sandwich full of meat, lettuce, sauce, cilanto, onions

Burritos:  Any meat choice including Lengua, Cabeza, Tripas, Carne Asada, and more.

The real deal!

Amazing complex flavors.

Atmosphere is down-home, clean, but looks dirty because it is in a rundown strip mall.  It is a sit down after you order from the counter type place.  Be forewarned, its run down, and not in a charming way.  Totally worth it for the food though.

Not fast food.  It always takes them quite awhile to prepare everything, and it shows in the results.

Cash Only."}
{"text":"No frills taco place! Ordered 2 carnitas tacos though on hindsight I should have ordered another type of meat instead. The nice thing about this place is really the food. What's not to like? Fresh warm and fluffy tortillas, topped with chopped carnitas cooked to the point of slight caramelization, and then finished with chopped onions and cilantro. Nice and simple. You can dress your tacos with lime wedges or the 2 types of salsa they provide. No beans or rice to cloud your perfect taco experience. I would come again if I set foot in PHX!"}
{"text":"UPDATE 2/6/2017
Good news: They now accept credit cards for a 50 cent fee
Bad news: The prices have gone up to $2.50 / taco ($3 for the specials like tongue).  A 25% proice hike seems a bit steep.

There are also new table coverings.  Still a great spot, just not the bargain it once was."}
{"text":"Tacos and tostados were absolutely delicious. Delicious meal, loved the vegetable tray you get as an appetizer. The place definitely looks a little sketchy outside, but the inside is nice. Highly recommend squeezing some lime on the tacos!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap buy delicious authentic street tacos, this is the place to go! I eat the Asmara tacos and they are great. The pickled veggies on the side balance out their multiple hot sauces. Definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Yum. Best. Tacos. Ever. Got the chicken tacos. 3. Then got them again for dessert. The staff is sweet and friendly. The service is lovely. The atmosphere is real. The price is great. The tacos are absolutely delish."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place so much that we had our rehearsal dinner here.  They are sooooo nice and accommodating - they did not bat an eyelash when we called to make a reservation for 20 people, and they let us bring our own birthday dessert for one of our party.  They set up a nice long table for us and even went around taking our orders (normally it's counter service).  The staff is always the sweetest.  The food is always the bombest.  My favorites are the lengua and carne asada tacos, but my parents love their burritos (all of them, which is saying a lot for a traditional first-gen Chinese couple) and their quesadillas are spot on.  Taco Sahuaro has ruined me for all other taco places.  How do they make their tortillas so delicious????"}
{"text":"Another lunch find for me. I don't even remember what I ordered but all of it was awesome and I shoveled it into my face like a hungry trash compactor. I plan on going back and repeating this many times in the future."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite taco shop. The food is authentic and the people are very friendly. I am now addicted to this place and have been going at least once or twice a week. The menu is extremely diverse and anyone can find something on the menu that they will enjoy. They even said they would do custom breakfast burritos in the morning even though they were not on the menu. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Mexican food."}
{"text":"Yum!  I was in the neighborhood for auto repairs and I'm glad I stopped.  The carne asada tacos and mini quesadilla totally hit the spot."}
{"text":"Amazing hole-in-the- wall type place! I have ordered various tacos (tripas, lengua, pastor, carnitas, asada) and they were all extremely delicious. My favorites have to be the tripas, carnitas, and pastor. I also tried one of their carnitas gorditas, and though it was not as stuffed as I had hoped it would be, it was still pretty good. 

I have ordered everything to-go and they always pack up my tacos in aluminum foil very securely along with a little baggie of cucumbers, sauces, carrots, and various other items I can't remember.

There is a surcharge of about 50 cents if you pay with credit card, so I would recommend bringing cash here. 

I would recommend ordering anything that catches your eye here as I am sure you will be pleased!"}
{"text":"Legit quality tacos.  $2/taco is very reasonable for the size, accompanying garnishes, & high level of service they provide.  

Definitely recommend the al pastor & carne asada tacos.  
Authentic mexican tacos with light crisp on the tortillas & freshly made salsas.

Also they have a fresh from scratch made Horchata for the many folks that love that drink."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! Hands down the BEST street tacos I have had - even better than some I have had in Mexico!! So authentic & so much flavor.  I order the Chicken and Steak - comes topped with Cilantros and Onions side of limes and cucumbers. 
They have all the Mexican sodas, the best Horchata, and the delicious salsas. 
Staff is very nice - and very quick! This place is always busy!"}
{"text":"The place is actally called Taco Saguaro   They are not cash only any more!  I was ready with cash but the party in front of us paid with cards. 

Cashier/waitress was super friendly and attentive.

No frills but delicious. Between the two if us we had taco, tostada, and burrito.  We tried all the meats. The best \"street tacos\" I have experienced this side of the boarder we love cilantro and there was lots on the tacos. The tostada was also delicious piled high with garnish. The burrito was also good but our least favorite of the three items. 

As for the meat we liked the carnitas and carne asada the most. Very well seasoned and finely chopped.

Being \"no frills\" they do not have air conditioning. We sat beneath the swamp cooler vent so we were pretty comfortable (it was a hot August day)"}
{"text":"The place is a \"Hole in the wall\" restaurant. Nothing to be said about the decor, but the food is amazing. I had the chorizo, carne asada, carnitas, brain, tongue and tripe tacos. They were all so AMAZING. Would for sure come back. the prices are reasonable, as well."}
{"text":"We have driven by here so many times and finally stopped in. Got three burritos and two street tacos. Verdict...so good!!!  Meet was tender and juicy and the girls behind counter were helpful with all of our questions. The burritos the kids loved and every last drop! They have a fabulous creamy red salsa and there are just no words to describe how good it was!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! 
The tacos themselves are so delicious, I've come back multiple times! My favorites are the carnitas and asada tacos and I always add aguacate! Their repasados are also worth a try. 

Another plus is the staff is always so nice and friendly! I've never had any moody behavior or rudeness from any cashier/server. It might not be a new hip modern taco place like JoyRide, but I'd prefer to come here any day! 

These are real tacos from really genuine people!"}
{"text":"Love the tacos al pastor here!  They are street tacos so not on the big size, but I don't mind chowing down on a few.  Good place for a quick eat.  But don't forget too bring some cash or you'll end up paying extra for using a credit card (hence the one star reduction)."}
{"text":"Most authentic and delicious Mexican food I've had in a long time. I'm originally from Tucson and was worried I wouldn't be able to get decent Mexican food in Phoenix. This place surpassed so many Mexican restaurants I've eaten in Tucson, couldn't be happier I found this place. Also the staff was super friendly, I'll be coming back here whenever I need my Mexican food fix!"}
{"text":"As current Duke of Tacos Sahuaro on Yelp, I guess it's about time I review it. This place is a block from my house, so that biases the review. However, there are other restaurants and dives just as close or closer that I've only been to once. TS definitely won me over. The first time I went in, I did what I normally do at a new taco joint and got 4 different street tacos. They were all delicious, and the carne asada definitely stood out as the best. The tacos came with fresh onion and cilantro, red and green salsa, a spicy dark salsa, and a bowl containing lime wedges, radish, peppers, and cucumber. All for $2 per taco. Brilliant. I've been too many times to count (check ins not reflective of actual visits), and tried almost everything on the menu. The carne asada is still my favorite, but I often switch it up. Also, their horchata is killer if you can get it. It doesn't last long during the day. The only thing I don't enjoy about the place is the $0.50 \"transaction fee\" for using a credit card. I think that's a load of it for businesses today, but I also don't like carrying cash, so it's the price I'm willing to pay for the best tacos in Phoenix. Truly, if you haven't been there yet, give it a shot."}
{"text":"Just finished devouring some delicious tacos. Prices are definitely reasonable. I had Asado and Pollo tacos, both were filling and hit the spot. I will definitely need to visit again to try some of the other tacos options. I only got an across the room peek at the burrito since none were ordered at my table, but they looked hearty as well."}
{"text":"I'm going to share my experience with y'all. 

First off, I had been looking for Tacos De Lengua (cow tongue tacos) for the longest time. I finally found this place, and although it took about an hour to drive here, I decided to give it a shot.
When I walked in the woman behind the counter greeted us (my significant other and I) with a smile. I looked at the menu and saw that they indeed sell Tacos De Lengua. My day was made, a plus one for that.
We ordered 8 tacos (4 Tacos De Lengua, 2 Tacos De Cabeza  and 2 Buche.) and a drink.
We sat down and the woman behind the counter brought us condiments (chili paste oil, green and red salsa, and carrots and jalapenos.)

When she finally brought us our food, the tortillas looked fresh made and the meat looked perfect. Let me just say this: IT WAS AMAZING. So worth the drive down there. 
The red salsa was mouth watering, it had a nice kick to it.

Overall, the experience was amazing. We will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Still 5 stars for me, but FYI, I think the price went up a bit.  I ordered 4 street tacos with a can of diet coke again but this time it was $9.  These were the chicken so maybe that's why they were more.  The chicken street tacos are even better than the carne asada.  Best chicken tacos ever.  I hope they open another one of these closer to where I live (north Phoenix).  by the way, be careful where you park, make sure it's in front of their establishment.  They said if you park next to the building next door someone will tow you."}
{"text":"Bomb! I knew when I walked in the door and saw an older woman chopping up fresh veggies! Tacos are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has EXCELLENT street tacos. The Carne Asada taco is one of the best I have had perfectly seasoned, grilled and perectly tender. 

FYI- for anyone who hasn't gone yet- when you are looking out for the restaurant the first time you go, make sure you look for Tacos Saguaro (that is what the sign says- for some reason Yelp has the name spelled wrong.)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were staying in Arizona for only a day and had a craving for Mexican food. Looked up restaurants near by and came across this whole in the wall. As we walked into the restaurant we were dubious to order but we've always known that hole in the walls tend to have the best food and this joint was no exception. I ordered the asada gordita and my husband the chorizo and asada tostada with a side of the mini chorizo quesadilla. Hands down this has been the best Mexican food we have eaten and even being from LA. The food was fresh made to order and did not taste of grease like other Mexican foods. Another upside was their affordable prices. The only downside is their small menu selection, but their tasty quality food makes up for it. If you are in town please give this modest hole in the wall a try! You will honestly not regret it!"}
{"text":"Great tacos, good service, really good salsa. I've tried the  tacos - almost all the different meats- from carne asada to tripa and they always satisfy! Their agua frescas are delicious!!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the beans are amazing! I had a classic bean and cheese burrito and it was so good! Also the best thing here is the pickled onion/jalapeño/carrots. These are legit to die for, they're so good!! 

PS: I'm attaching new menu pics."}
{"text":"The Phoenix New Times said this place had really good lengua tacos.  They were right. The lengua and the tripa tacos were done to perfection. 

The staff was still attentive even though it is a counter order joint. 

Only complaint is the place is a little dark and dirty on the inside."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying these people are graded an A business so it's clean. The food I had was so flavorful and non standard. They have their own flare for their food and it is just brilliantly delicious. Hand made tortillas are spectacular. It's not a pretty restaurant but again it's clean and the food is great. It is worth the trip in I don't care how snooty you might be take the food to go because it is so worth it. We didn't take pics they would look like these others so what's the point we shoulda taken a pic of our happy faces. The location is the only drawback really. There is more parking in the rear but how to get there is not clear. The front lot sucks. If the relocated but kept the food as is they are 5 star eatery."}
{"text":"This made it into our Taco Tuesday list and we paid a visit a few days ago. It's a humble looking establishment with no bells and whistles. Moreover, they don't need them since their food is quite terrific. Service is incredibly quick and flavors are on point! I was really excited to see that they have mini quesadillas. My beef with quesadillas is that the portion size is generally too big to order anything else. But with mini quesadillas, you get to sample the same thing with lesser commitment. 

I placed an order for al pastor taco and pollo mini quesadilla. We got seated and the server brought over a couple of stone ramekins with all kinds of pickled goodness and two kinds of salsas! The food arrived shortly and we were not disappointed. The corn tortillas tastes incredibly fresh and there was an explosion of flavors with both the taco and quesadilla. If you're in a rush, this place is perfect. I would certainly return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The staff is so nice & remembered me & my girlfriend after the second time. The tacos are to die for, they have taco de lingua too which is really hard to come by. Definitely eat here if you're in the mood for Mexican"}
{"text":"First thought is where do I park?! I parked out front then realized they had parking out back as well so I pulled around into the alley and parked in the back, came in through the back door. Place was empty, ugly. But very pleasantly surprising. My order was taken by a very nice lady that spoke English and Spanish! I read all the great reviews on the tacos so I had to try some. Got 3 asada tacos and 3 pork tacos. Came out very hot! Ate the pork first, lots of good flavor in there. They give you all kinds of fixins for your tacos! Pork was very good. Then the asada tacos. They were ok, kind of bland so you need to flavor it up with everything. Still everything was very good, you can tell they have good quality meat and products. I will come back."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Phoenix.  Period.  Super friendly staff.  Sure, I wish it were in a more convenient place where I felt a bit safer, but hey, I'm just a wimpy 40-something.  I tried to buy 5-7 pounds of their carne asada for a party I was throwing and they weren't willing to sell me it in bulk, so that's a bummer, but I'm not going to ding their rating based on that."}
{"text":"Very good street tacos and sopes !. 
there is something with the hand made sopes and tortillas. they are absolutely addicting.. and, absolutely worth a try.."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim with a work buddy. We both got 3 carne asada tacos a piece and they were pretty damn good. Classic street taco, asada was money and dirt cheap. Going back for sure."}
{"text":"Liked the carne asada burritos!  They seemed authentic and came with the cucumbers and radish on the side with limes.  The green salsa makes it super tasty but the RED salsa will burn your tongue off!  I thought the meat was very well-seasoned and they gave a good amount of meat.  I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and I must say very impressed! I'm not even from Phoenix and I can say these are one of the best tacos I've ever had!! They serve their food fresh and hot off the stove! I had a taco of carne asada and pastor! Must mention their sauce is very good as well! Wish I had more room to try more! Will deff be returning to try more off their menu!! This place is a must try! Very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Two words: cheap & good. Cant go wrong with the agua fresca (cucumber) and their homemade gorditas! Will stop by again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I want to return to Phoenix just to eat here again! This place is a total hole in the wall filled with locals. Its cheap and delicious! I got the carnitas meal and it was a big serving of meat with rice, beans and fresh warm tortillas. It was probably some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. I will definitely be back the next time I am in the area. Maybe they could expand and open up in NYC?"}
{"text":"I have Finally found a Taco location worth spending my money at! 

 I have many friends over the years that would always say \"You need to check this place out\" or \"this other place is sooo authentic\", after listening to many of them and trying out their recommendations, I have come to the conclusion many of my friends are LIARS! ha-ha. I always got directed to trendy horrible places... 

I am born and raised here in AZ and am 33 yrs. old now, I have travelled far and wide to find some bomb carne asada tacos and it seemed to be a lost cause until now. Tacos Sahuaro is my new hang out spot for sure! Its located in a strip mall and honestly its pretty sketchy, but these tacos are def worth getting shanked in the parking lot... (Joking, you more then likely will not get shanked)! 

Inside the place honestly, It could probably use a deep cleaning. It doesn't smell bad or anything, it could just use a fresh coat of paint, some ambiance, and a Professional tile cleaner. However, I wasn't here for the ambiance... I was here for some tacos!

Tacos are 2 bucks a pop and I ordered 3 Carne asada and 1 chicken, my wife ordered a couple tacos (she was a bit sketched out by the location). We sat down and they brought us some sides like carrots and onions, and some cucumbers, lime and salsas. We got our tacos and I tried the hot hot salsa on my taco and as I took my first bit into heaven I shed 1 tear! This taco was amazing! My taste buds were orgasming (Not literally)!!! The tortilla makes up a lot of the flavor. They double up the corn tortilla and cook the outsides, and insides are doughy. The carne asada was spot on and the hot ass salsa was the topper!!!! I ordered 2 more they were so good. Its a simple shop, tacos burritos and gorditas, no chips (saves more room for tacos).

Set aside the worry of the neighborhood if you want a bombastic taco! This place will not disappoint! Im already planning me next trip this weekend.


**** Update****

I was crazing the tacos so I went back for another visit. This time I learned they will make you fresh corn tortillas for your tacos while I requested and OMG!!!! THEY WERE SOOO GOOD!!! I also tried a Gordita. I was pretty hesitant because I grew up with having just meat inside. I bit into the carne asada gordita and i most passed out because it was sooo damn good (im pretty dramatic, lol). I had to order another one."}
{"text":"Oh yeah Carne Asada tacos are fantastic - 3 tacos at $2 each is insanely low and they are large street tacos and the burrito is a meal and a half - pineapple juice is a pleasant refreshing surprise - service is excellent and it's warm inside so sit in front of one of the portable little ac units and no sports on TV it's Mexican TV best 2-3 tacos in the valley"}
