{"text":"A pub where you're never quite sure what's going to happen. It works for me though. Staff good and considerate. Can be a wee bit overworked during that half hour when everybody wants service NOW. Tonight's special was an excellent Jigs Dinner, the tradition Newfoundland meal. What a surprise on a cold night in Toronto! Not sure I'd entertain clients here unless I really knew them."}
{"text":"Great finger food, great service and best of all 5 dollar pints! Tried the spring rolls, wings, chicken nuggets (Buffalo style) and onion rings...all of them were winners :D"}
{"text":"Love getting silly at the Goose! The owners, Terry and Sonny and so nice, accomodating, and personal. They call everyone by name and make you feel so welcome! Chicken wings are great, as are the other menu items I've had. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Visiting Canada for the first time and decided to keep it very local and couldn't be happier to find this spot. Terri & Sunny were very pleasant, great conversation on places/things to do, drinks Terri made were right on point, and the onion rings tasted delish!! Very nice atmosphere and ambiance for a local bar. Worth checking out- I'll be back for Karaoke night!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean.  It's half way between here and there so it works for music. Pool and a pint."}
