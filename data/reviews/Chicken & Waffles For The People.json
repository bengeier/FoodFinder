{"text":"Food truck stopped by my apartment, and since i never had chicken and waffle before i decided to try, i wasn't disappointed at all food was good.... saw my neighbor having the rice bowl and it look and smelled great , he said it was really good !"}
{"text":"Best Chicken and Waffle spot in AZ!! Especially the Red Velvet Waffle, it is delicious!! Chicken is seasoned well and was cooked to perfection. Must Have Must Try"}
{"text":"We had the Bbque chicken sandwich and the wings with mango chile dipping sauce. Delicious and hit the spot . Thank you  ...yuummmie"}
{"text":"Decided to try them because they were outside of my job & tbh I should've just ordered in. I ordered a banana, strawberry, & Nutella waffle & a chicken Philly-- $20. The waffle was great--even though no syrup was provided. But the chicken Philly was horrible!! I asked the cashier before deciding on it if the meat was chicken breast & she said it was. By the time I started eating it I couldn't take a bite through because there was so much gristle; I called the number listed & a woman answered & informed me it was leg meat. I took my Philly back & asked for a refund. The chef attempted to give me a refund--attempted because it's been 2 weeks & I still haven't seen the money back in my account -_-"}
{"text":"This food truck came to my work today and I was not impressed at all. Few things that made this not great.
First off for a food truck this meal of chicken and waffles was 12 dollars. I got 5 chicken bites and a small waffle. The waffle was not good at all. It was very flaky and did taste great at all. I would of rather eaten a frozen waffle from Lego my eggo. 

Next the wait time was way to long for a food truck. I waited about 20 min. People who came after me reviewed their chicken well before me."}
{"text":"What in the world just happened?! This waffle was hands down the best Belgian waffle I've ever had. The staff was super friendly and I recommend this!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Food Truck! Tasty, fresh, quality food. I was surprised to find them right outside my apartment one evening. I'm sure our complex management put together some sort of promotion, but I think they forgot to tell the Tenants. 
Anyways, I decided to grab dinner since they were right outside my door. There's at least one perk of living in the front of the complex! I ordered the Cajun Po Boy sandwich with grilled shrimp and chicken andouille sausage for $12. I added a fresh made strawberry limeade for $3. I was very pleased to see *We Accept Credit Cards* at the top of the menu, so I ordered freely. 
My sandwich was on fresh french bread and topped with a drizzle of cajun remoulade. The shrimp was nicely seasoned with cajun spice and grilled perfectly, not overdone. My only suggestion was add tomatoes or maybe add mayo to the bread. I found it only slightly dry since french bread is so fluffy and starchy. But the quality and tenderness of the shrimp made up for it. The limeade was perfect to wash it down with.
I also ended going back twice: once to get chicken and waffles ($12 large 5 pc chicken) for my partner when he got home later and for a Nutella banana topped red velvet waffle $8, for dessert. They gave us another red velvet waffle topped with fresh berries and white chocolate drizzle free! Best dinner in ages, and all from a random Food Truck in front of my door!"}
{"text":"I tried this food truck that was in my community last month.  first of all the wait for food took a really long time.  when  I got it they didn't serve it with syrup, and trying to get that also took a long time..       I didn't care for the breading on the chicken and the pieces were limp.  they were either understaffed or really disorganized. won't be going to this food truck again."}
{"text":"We had the classic chicken and waffles at the Street Food Cinema on 4/16/16.  Oh my goodness!  It was PERFECT.  Customer Service was SPOT ON!  The lady who took our order was so kind and accommodating.  My daughter and I split an order of Chicken and Waffles.  The waffle was light, fluffy and gently sweet.  The chicken was meaty, flavorful, tender and juicy. We were given two different sauces to try, the garlic parmesan- which was super flavorful and a little zesty. The other was the bourbon sauce, which was sweet and had a nice hint of heat.  The only downside is that they had run out of bananas when my daughter went back to get dessert during the movie.  That's OK- we will definitely hit them up again, and order dessert first! :-)"}
{"text":"Went to the food truck for Breakfast. Ordered home fries with a side of bacon off the menu.. what I got was damn near raw bacon with a side of seasoned french fries. The man at the counter had the nerve to catch an attitude when I asked \"are these are your home fries???\"... I'm from the EastCoast and I know they do things a bit different out here but dammit... French fries ain't home fries!!! Worst $8 I ever spent on breakfast"}
{"text":"Last time they were booked at my location they were a no-show. This time they did show up, but 45 minutes into their 2 hour engagement, they shut down their fryer (so no chicken and no fries) and ran out of cheese for their sandwiches. The woman taking orders was rude and unorganized and the service was extremely slow. What I had was pretty good, but not exactly worth a nearly one hour wait."}
{"text":"Dipping sauces are delicious with the wings!! Love the garlic parm! And of course the waffles  fluffy and light. Definitely a must when you go to the food trucks."}
{"text":"I tried this truck for the first time at the Food Streets Cinema. And I think it was love at first bite! Next time I see this truck on the street the first thing I'm going to do is run to it. It may look like an scene with Bo Derek, but there is no shame. This chicken is well seasoned, perfectly breaded, not greasy at all, which is surprising. Instead of breast they seem to use dark meat, which is jucier, and my favorite. Plus they got a nice choice of delicious sauces to drip on top in combination with the sweetness of the syrup... I tell you, its good! Its a very nice amount for the money. I ordered the 5 piece and they were very nice size nuggets... no relation to McNuggets, these ones are the real deal. The waffle needs work, not my favorite, but through the chicken all else is not a big deal."}
{"text":"Super bomb. Chicken was crispy and tender. Waffles sweet and savory. Mixing them together was heaven! Thanks for the amazing dinner!
Sincerely, your stoned food truck Friday customer. :)"}
{"text":"We shared the sample sized Chicken and Waffle. The waffle was nice and fluffy and very large. The chicken was sort of over cooked and chewy and was topped with (I think) hibiscus honey. All in all it was tasty but it's a shame that it was over cooked. Maybe they do better on the full size items...?

2.75 stars"}
{"text":"These waffles are amazing! And the chicken is pretty good too! This food truck comes to Thieves market in Tempe on Saturdays and I was going to go to the flea market today just to get some waffles...but they didn't show up there today  
Seriously, the best waffles I've ever had."}
{"text":"So they came to our work today.  Never had their food before, but company was paying so I was all about it.  Super excited.  

A little more than half way through our team, they ran out of chicken.  Really?  So it became just waffles.  Needless to say many people were pissed.

One person also found a piece of metal wiring (the kind you tie the chicken wrapping up with) in their chicken.  Sorry I didn't keep the pic of that.

Would not reccommend.

P.S.  waffle was good though"}
{"text":"Stopped by this food truck today and I have to say it was very tasty. I had the regular chicken and waffles. For $10, you get a large soft waffle, 2 meaty legs, 2 meaty wings, a dipping sauce and a maple syrup. The chicken is lightly seasoned and crispy, the waffle is soft (I'm more of a fan of crispy-ish waffles, but the flavor of their waffle was delicious). They also had 5 or 6 other options: waffle w/ nutella & bananas,waffle w/ mixed berries, some sort of salad are all that come to mind.  I picked the Kickin' Bourbon dipping sauce and it was really good. Sweet, a smidge spicy, and a nice accompaniment to the chicken."}
{"text":"Some of the best, savory and juicy fried chicken I've ever had! The waffle was perfect and decadent, mouth watering desert options are also offered. I was pleasantly surprised not only by the quality of the food but by the customer service. I will definitely be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"Excellent! $10 got me a big fluffy waffle and 3 pieces of fried chicken. Hot syrup and homemade ranch...YUM! Very personable, orders are taken by name."}
{"text":"My first encounter with this food - truck was last Saturday at the first opening of Street Food Cinemas this summer. I ordered the $12 chicken and waffle which is a 5 piece of choice chicken that comes with a waffle and two sauce choices. I noticed I was only given the $10 chicken and waffle order which was only 3 pieces. I went back and told the lady and showed her my receipt on my phone which included TIP. She just looked at it and said 'okay' and took my plate and gave me a new one. After walking to my seat I also noticed she only gave me my one sauce. Prior to bringing out my order she asked which two sauce I wanted and I told her. For some reason she only gave me one. You asked me for both sauces of choice and only give me one?! So I go back and wait by the side of the front; I know the lady saw me but ignores me and decides to help the next two people in line. I'm irritated at this point because I have already been in line and had to correct her mistake once. Finally she looks over and asks me, \"anything else?\" I tell her that she forgot my sauce and it's my second time coming back and she just hands me the sauce without no apology or remorse whatsoever! Worst customer service ever! No tip should have even been given! When customer service is this horrid the food doesn't even matter!"}
{"text":"Waffles are so good they need no butter or syrup! I got the 3 dark meat tenders and waffles delish!! The bourbon sauce is amazing!!!! Everything coming off the truck looked great!!!"}
{"text":"The food truck stopped by my apartment and I tried the large chicken and waffles. The waffle was perfect - crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Chicken was fried to perfection and didnt even need the provided sauces. Great portion sizes priced right. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love me a good food truck was excited to find them in my community.
I also love some breakfast for dinner Chicken and waffles seemed like a good idea for a Wednesday night.

large chicken and waffles for $16 and upgraded mine to red velvet.
The food truck was not very crowded but I had to wait a good 15 minutes.
I really wanted to love them more but the waffles were underwhelming and tasted funny,they were soft but not sweet at all and I have a sweet tooth the syrup was very little and could not redeem them.

The fried chicken was fresh and crispy and could use a little more coating.They have a number of sauces like bbq,sweet chili,garlic Parmesan etc.

Overall I'd say skip the red velvet.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"This truck is amazing! Everything is fresh and hand made right on the spot! The chicken is perfectly breaded and the waffles have a wonderful crisp on the outside and warm fluffy center. Awesome awesome awesome chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"My daughter was asking one of the lady's on the food truck if she liked to cook and she said yes and asked if you want to come on the food truck. My daughter shrieked yes! She go to cook with them, make her own waffle, and cooked around 10 others. Then, she came back with 2 other friends and they cooked some too! The food was also delicious! Especially the chicken!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken and waffle plate with 5 pieces that came with a choice of two sauces for $12.
The service was pretty quick and was so excited for some chicken and waffles. 
Upon receiving my order I realized I was missing the sauces and only received 3 pieces of chicken. So I went back and asked for the other two pieces and the sauces. The lady asked if we paid for it and obviously we did I showed her my receipt on my phone for proof. Now I wouldn't haven been frustrated if she would have apologized and just gave me the other missing items. We were also the first ones to order from them with no one before or after me. 
The chicken was under seasoned and had fatty tissue. And the sauces weren't good either. I'll try another food truck when I see this one."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!  If you ever see this truck, stop and get yourself a waffle!  So darn good!"}
{"text":"The best fried chicken I've had!! You can tell that it's made fresh, and done the right way!! Tons of flavor and so hot you just have to sit and smell it until it's cool enough!! So great! My brother loved the waffles, I definitely will be getting one next time! Friendly and fantastic service! I hope we can find them again soon!"}
{"text":"I love trying new food trucks when I can. Was very excited this was located on my way home! We got chicken cheesesteak and fries, chicken over rice and waffle with bananas and Neutella. The cheesesteak was good, found some gristle but hey that happens. $4 for a tiny portion of undercooked dripping with oil \"fries\" was sad. The chicken and rice was all right, about $5 worth of food  but cost $10. The waffle was dry and bland. Disappointing."}
