{"text":"Excellent food at a great price with fast and friendly staff.   If you enjoy the newer fast casual approach to food, this is the Korean BBQ version of this type.  The location is new, clean and has free parking. A great alternative to Chipotle and is still has a limited number of locations."}
{"text":"I visited a few months ago when it first opened up and i had a horrible experience (food made me sick, they ran out of WATER, syrup came out of the vending machine instead of actual juice). So I visited again to see if it had gotten better - it didn't. The food wasn't bad this time, but when I specifically asked for \"no kale or cheese,\" they still gave me both. They didn't have cups for the miso soup or sauce cups, and I received less change than I was supposed to get, as I paid in cash. Tbh, I'm team chipotle."}
{"text":"Went on their opening day. It's make your own bibimbap. Excellent food. Fast, casual and cheap. Food was fresh and well portioned. Lots of vegetables making the meal guilt free! Loved the variety of sauces - you can take as much as you need. The free miso soup was a little bland, but it's free. Overall, an excellent addition to University Circle. A healthy place to dine. Will be coming back many times - probably tom!"}
{"text":"This place is a create your own rice/noodle/roll place with Korean inspiration. I was excited to try this place, but was underwhelmed by the food. The decor was great - ample lighting, both long tables and booths, - and super friendly staff. Price was good and portions were large. Free miso soup and a sauce station for all your needs. However, what really got me to pick this rating was my rice bowl. Sure, it's a make your own, but I had my sauce on the side. So my order was marinated chicken with rice and some of the veggies. Nevertheless, there was something ridiculously sweet in my bowl, and the sauce seeped into the rice and veggies so that a few bites in and everything tasted sickly sweet. I was having serious trouble finishing my food.   Because of the convenient location, I'll probably give this place another try and order one of the other proteins. But definitely not the marinated chicken again."}
{"text":"Stopped in today while walking around the CWRU campus after being handed a menu outside. I was with my daughter and parents, so a wide range of ages/tastes. We were really impressed. The food was fresh, it was prepared quickly as we directed the building of our bowls, and we were all able to customize as we liked, with some going really spicy (spicy chicken and Sriracha sauce) and others staying on the tamer side.  We all enjoyed it. Definitely a do again when we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"For a quick service build it yourself restaurant, the food was pretty good.  The key to these places is volume to keep the food fresh and they seemed to have enough when I stopped by at mid afternoon.  The proteins and toppings are rather limited, but they tasted great and fresh.  Eventually, you may tire of the limited selections but they have a variety of sauces to mix things up.  The decor is sleek and modern with booths and several communal tables.  My only complaint is AC fan was turned up too high,  like eating in a wind tunnel."}
{"text":"Good food for a nearby. Haven't got tried of it! The warm soup is pretty suitable for the winter"}
{"text":"Sort of Korean food and sort of nice fir what it is. I don't care for then making their employees shout \"Welcome to Bibibop!\" at you when you walk through the door, but what can you do. I also don't care for the pseudo health nonsense.   The food though, is solid. It's a rice bowl with quality ingredients, and I'm a sucker for a sauce with gochujang (the base for the \"Korean red\")."}
{"text":"Got out of work early and stumbled upon this place. A Korean version of Chipotle is an accurate description and it doesn't disappoint. You walk into the restaurant and your hit with this alluring fragrance that makes you even more curious of what awaits... I randomly assembled a bowl and was a little concerned about the creation I concocted. Then I looked at it and it was Instagram worthy and really tasted good! You should try but remember that this is an express version of the traditional meal. Adjust your expectations accordingly and you'll have a good, healthy meal."}
{"text":"Most enthusiastic staff I have ever interacted with. From the moment I walk in the door, there's someone yelling from behind the counter \"Welcome to Bibibop!\", and please note that this counter is at least a good 20 steps away from the front door.   Food wise, imagine the build-a-bowl style of Chipotle combined with the noodle flair of Panda Express and a dash of health-conscious Sweet Greens. Now imagine placing all of the cold ingredients together in neat piles on top of a base layer of coldish noodles or rice, topping it off with your choice of warmed meat, and then sealing it off with a sweet deal (less than $8 for a large bowl) for a meal that can honestly last you two or three meals. This is Bibibop - a place of endless sauces and bottomless (free) miso soup. For college students and the hospital employees, this is a refreshing new alternative to the Student Union, the Atrium Cafe, and even the restaurants across the street.   Interior design here is brightly lit, hip and chic, and the food fills you up without breaking the bank. For the wallet-conscious, this is a great choice for a quick Asian-esque lunch or dinner in the Uptown area (just don't expect a hot stone bowl of Bibimbap). Car parking can be found behind Constantino's - just make sure to follow the times on the parking signs (2-hrs vs 4-hrs). Easily walkable from UH and the Case Western campus.  Side note - I still cannot muster the courage to add the beans or the cheese to my noodle bowl. It's too much of a stretch into Chipotle territory..."}
{"text":"It was very good! First time being there and I loved It! They had amazing lemonade, and they had a good selection of combinations to choose from. It tasted very fresh and the kale was awesome! I will most likely be there again. A great deal for a big bowl as well! The miso soup was good too! Very hot, but nothing wrong with a nice bowl of hot miso. I would totally recommend this place for people who want a quick bite to eat, and want something on the fresher side than most fast-food joints."}
{"text":"First off, I love that they give you a ton of food for prices that are lower than Chipotle's, and they have free miso soup. Also their service is pretty quick so no long waits!   However, I give a 3/5 rating because the food itself tastes just okay. Granted, I might be picky about Asian food since i grew up in California. The food seems healthy and fresh, but the meat is too salty, tasting only like soy sauce, whereas all the other toppings are bland. I love bibimbap, and the food here does not help curb cravings for Korean food.   Overall, I'd come eat here again with friends but probably pass if it's just myself looking for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. They have super fresh ingredients, and I really appreciate that it's \"build your own bowl,\" as I can be very picky when it comes to certain vegetables. Expect to pay about 7 or 8 dollars, which is quite responsible.   I only have two complaints: 1. Every time I've gone here I've felt incredibly rushed by the employees. You don't even have time to ask for a fountain cup before they blurt your total and stick their hand out for payment. 2. Seating during peak times is non-existent because people sit around for hours at tables, even after they've finished eating. I wouldn't come here with a group bigger than 3 or 4, you won't be able to eat in."}
{"text":"A very modern looking restaurant. I had a free coupon. It is similar to Chipotle style when you order. I liked the food but more of a fast food vibe than authentic asian food. I like that it was on the healthier side. They serve complimentary miso soup but it was not very good and more bland."}
{"text":"So good So fresh!  First you choose from a base of brown or purple rice, three lettuce salads, or noodles.  Then you choose from a large assortment of freshly chopped, diced, minced veggies.  You then choose from a variety of proteins like tofu, spicy chicken, saut√©ed beef and finally choose a savory flavorful dressing or go commando!   They have a sauce bar to mix and match yourself - create your personal flavor and soup, everyone can get a free miso soup    For drinks there is bubble tea and fruit teas."}
{"text":"I had had absolutely low expectations for the food here, and it served me well. If you come in expecting a Korean Chipotle, with the appropriate amount of authenticity, then you're good to go!  I was the only one in line, but the staff here rushed rushed me to the checkout line - felt unsettling. I came around 2pm at a non-peak time, and  dined in. I was trying to enjoy a nice lunch, when I  some trendy music started playing. The three or four employees in the back proceeded to screech and start dancing in the back, and making a ruckus. All 6 of us diners stopped to eat and stared at them for a good 5 minutes until they started settling down. I'm glad they had fun, but that was extremely  unprofessional.   As for the food itself, most of the flavor is carried by the various sauces they squirt onto the dish. I had requested their original flavor, and they dumped a good amount in my bowl in one quick, smooth action. Had I known, I would have asked for 1/4 the amount of sauce.   Next time I would order takeout, 1/4 the sauce."}
{"text":"I swear Uptown has every sort of \"make your own bowl\" sort of restaurant within the span of two blocks. Bibibop is a Korean restaurant chain where you can make your own bowl of rice, salad, or noodles, or make a roll with a variety of toppings. Their meat options are simple - pick chicken, spicy chicken, steak, or tofu. You have the freedom to add any or none of the toppings that they have, as with other places like this. When all is said and done, you'll be feasting with your eyes with all the different colors of toppings, but also leave you full without feeling gross. For about $7, you could get two meals out of one bowl depending on how hungry you are at the moment. They have free miso soup as a nice palate cleanser. I did enjoy their variety of ice teas and lemonades, if you're willing to spend an extra $1.99."}
{"text":"I have a new love.  At first I was intimidated because this is another place where I have to create my own and I'm known for being terrible at picking flavors.  But after reading other reviews and seeing what other people enjoyed, I just had to go.  Everything was outstanding: from being greeted when you walk in, the non-stop friendly service, the free miso soup, the ability to have extra sauce, and the bright and clean atmosphere.   And the food was awesome too!  I got the steak bowl ($7.49) with noodles, sprouts, carrots, broccoli, kale, and corn with the sesame ginger sauce.  Loved every bit that my stomach could handle and am saving the rest for lunch tomorrow.  The following day I plan on going back to try a chicken and rice option."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice. I would totally go here for lunch 5-6x a week, haha. Your typical bibimbap, but with more options and no dolsot (hot stone). Honestly, it's your Korean chipotle! Interior is great and the service is amazing along with the food. Come here for a bite if you're into Asian bistro and need something quick and filling!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of the food. You can't go overboard with adding items because a lot of the flavors don't work with each other. I also felt that the rice, potatoes, and vegetables were very bland.   With that said, service was incredible and the vibe is happy& exciting.   The space is WAY too small and crowded however. I often found myself squeezing behind and between people."}
{"text":"We ordered two salads to go and got a fully loaded treat. Tasty, fresh and a great value.  The staff was friendly enough and our bowls were made to order in the fashion of most of these fast casual chipotle like places.   The protein choices of steak, chicken, spicy chicken, or tofu all looked good.  We chose spicy and regular chicken and enjoyed them both.  The bonus today was free miso soup!  Quite enjoyable and hit the spot as an appetizer for our lunch. Bathroom was nice and clean as was the rest of the restaurant.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at bibibop and boy was it a good one. Ya see this is a brand new location so it didn't have a yelp page and I am so passionate about this restaurant I created one. First of all the customer service was hands down the best customer service I have EVER experienced. Evan, project manager of the bubble tea, was such a kind soul. Although there was no boba for the tea he offered to make us a special drink and upgrade us to the large size. He then came over and proceeded to follow up with us. He was so friendly and demonstrated how passionate he was about rn he company. It was so refreshing to see such a hardworking and dedicated soul in the food industry. Evan will definitely go very far. Another employe I conversed with was equally as kind. She offered a bright smile and genuine conversation. Not to mention she helped me find the spoons! I've had yelp for a while now and I haven't left a review ever... but for this I just had to share! Awesome place awesome customer service 11/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I liked the black rice. Good portions at a decent price. Many combinations available"}
{"text":"this place is so good. great location, fresh veggies, generous portions, inexpensive, delicious sauces, free miso soup. i did not eat here and service was fine, they were accommodating to me wanting several different sauces on the side. will be back soon and frequently!"}
{"text":"This is pretty nice easy place for korean mixing bowl. It is kinna Bibimbap in Korean. I like the idea and feel healthy. I think the sauce that you will not go wrong will be korean red. Free miso soup and unlimited sauce are the plus!!!  ....love it and will go back there!!!!"}
{"text":"Cheap and good food. Free miso soup and also a sauce bar. Beware that it does tend to be on the saltier side. My recommendation is to not get your sauces in line but instead put them in little cartons from the sauce bar."}
{"text":"Amazing! This place knows how to food. It's a must try if you're on the go looking for something on the healthier side. With a wide range of options at a flat affordable price, you can't beat it! The aesthetic of this restaurant is modern and appealing, and the quality of food is something to rave about. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty average, but the portions are very generous for the price and they give you free miso soup with every order. The food seemed fresh, but with little coordination this place falls into the Barrio trap--where people just put everything in their bowl and it doesn't really work out in the end. I wish I could order a pre-planned bowl where the flavors are intended to be mixed. I don't know how much this place really adds to University Circle with Otani Noodle, Bamboo Garden, Ninja City, Kenko & Chopstick. Did we really need a 6th asian food place in University Circle?"}
{"text":"Really simple yet tasty food. It's like a Chipotle just Asian style. The steak goes perfectly with the yum yum sauce and it's just the right amount of food. The staff are a breath of fresh air. As soon as you walk in they are yelling \"welcome\" and very helpful. Someone in line was gluten free and they triple checked to make sure the food he was eating was gluten free. I will def be back"}
{"text":"I received a coupon for a free meal at BIBIBOP Asian Grill. The restaurant is clean, cute, and modern. I would describe the entire experience as a Asian Chipotle, with better pricing. A large bowl will run about $6.25-ish and a small bowl $5.25-ish (can't remember the exact change.)   However, a couple things felt \"off,\" during my visit. First off, they ran out of noodles, leaving only rice or a wrap as an option for the starch. Secondly, the staff seemed somewhat unprofessional and untrained. When placing my order, the staff had completely no idea what was vegetarian friendly and what wasn't. A girl behind us in line was thankfully able to point out a brochure that had all the dietary and allergen information listed. When I finished my meal, I went to the register and asked for a lid, only to be rudely told \"we don't have any.\" The cashier actually turned away when I asked if there was anything to cover my bowl with. I finally asked for a bag, and one was thrusted at me. I stuck my open bowl in the bag, and carried it out that way.    Overall, the food was fresh and cheap, but the service left me with a sour taste in my mouth. I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! It becomes one of my favorites. It is like Asian style of Chipotle, and you can build your own meal. Everything looks healthy and only costs little to get full. They even have free miso soup! I personally love their sesame ginger sauce."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Uptown, especially when you want something quick, nutritious, and easy. Line can get a bit long but it goes through very quickly. Highly recommend getting the kimchi - it's worth the extra. There's also complimentary miso to warm you up, and sauces on the sides if they don't give you enough when they make it."}
{"text":"Supa fresh. Clean, modern looking spot open right by campus of Case Western Reserve University. As a 2010 Alum, I can say these kids have no idea how lucky they are with all the great food options. The best in my day was Best Steak and Gyro in the hood (respect if you've eaten here before).  It's an asian chipotle with 4 decision points - carb (rice, noodle or salad), protein, toppings and sauce. I made a salad bowl with spicy chicken and korean red sauce. The colors from the bowl are awesome, very artistic and instaworthy. Red from the sauce, purple from the cabbage, green from the salad, yellow from the corn, orange from the carrots.   Bowl was tasty and healthy. Not overly filling like a chipotle bowl but still good serving size. Pro tip: the Korean red sauce is legit spicy so do as you dare.   Although no longer a Case student, I will be back to try different bowl combinations! #8yearstoolate"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Tastes fresh enough.  The staff? Yeah, about that....you sorta kinda gotta be kidding me.  Obviously whoever owned it or managed it wasn't in the day I was there.  In between bites I was regaled with raucous \"singing\" or hollering or bellowing or some other loud obnoxious sounds coming from behind that counter.   Oh and the soda fountain didn't work. Which is almost but not quite as absurd as if they'd run out of rice and kimchi.    Other than that...couldn't imagine spending the money and opening a new place and allow it to be run without any supervision."}
{"text":"- Sodium is through the roof just the ingredients themselves. Opt to add the sauces by yourself at the condiments station (instead of by the staff).  - Seating is seriously limited. Come before 11am and 5pm if you want a seat at all.   - the height of the tables is not conducive for toddlers sitting through your meals. Easier to take meals home. They do have high chairs if you are early enough to get a dinner-table height seat. The interior design of this establishment had adults in mind.   + I got my toddler to consume a lot of veggies here. I ask for all sides that's not spicy. They are delicious. Partly due to the saltiness.   + It's fast and furious. Chipotle style."}
{"text":"Good- for what it is.   I think most disappointed reviewers are expecting authentic bibimbap- which is super flavorful with unique textural elements from the hot stone bowl... I know that's what I was hoping for based on the name... Instead, this place is what many people have referred to as the Korean chipotle....  You don't go to Chipotle looking for authentic Mexican food... similarly, this place won't feed your cravings for authentic Korean cuisine. But it's all right for what it is: a quick bowl of Korean-ish style food.   Does anybody know of a place to get delicious authentic bibimbap around here?? I'm still looking."}
{"text":"Another of the Chipotlesque eateries springing up with other food styles. With all of these mix three, bowl slap or wrap places the food quality is the standout. Here it's very good, and they have enough sauces to keep it interesting. They offer feee miso soup which is dope. The drinks offer passion fruit lemonade which is a great taste. Some cane sodas would fit it's healthier vibe. My bowl with noodle and spicy chicken was actually spicy! Maybe the sriracha sauce helped a tad... The sameness of the meats and tofu in these concepts gets a star down otherwise it's great! Located right next to Case Western, so you have a bullt-in audience for institutional food boredom, need an Asian oasis break. It's busy. There's a reason. In the dash n' dine category, this is a top area offering. Go and grab!"}
{"text":"Many of my fellow friends suggested this place to me, and it seemed interesting considering it's a new Asian grille added onto university circle strip of food stores.    The service line reminded me of chipotle, but like a Asian version of chipotle. I wasn't impressed, the hype was not that great.  I'll take a authentic bibbop over Asian grille, overall I did enjoy it and wanted to taste their \"free miso soup\" but they did not have any.   Preparation could be better."}
{"text":"My new favorite healthy restaurant. Great food, fast with cool vibe and sunny bright atmosphere. A Korean rice bowl with purple rice, spicy chicken, and a dozen veggies, bean sprouts, kimchi and and yum yum sauce. Healthy eating should be this good and it is."}
{"text":"Great fast casual alternative to chipotle and other Asian restaurants. The purple rice is very good and has a slight nutty flavor that goes great with chicken protein. The sprouts are my favorite topping and I can never get enough of them. The fresh vegetables and kimchi make it feel like im making an healthy food choice, even though I don't know if that's true by the time I put a cup of the banging yum yum sauce all over it..Love that there is sauce options available away from the order counter too so if you get the food to go you can load up on sauces without getting food soggy. Love this spot and if I lived closer I would go a couple times a week."}
{"text":"Great place.   Excellent Food.  Looking forward to new store open in Orange. Love the purple rice with black beans. I would like to try some or other dishes on next visit."}
{"text":"So had heard great things about the place but I was skeptical. I've been to a few places like this before in other cities with varying success. Finally got to try it out today and was pleasantly surprised. It's a chain, so I'll knock it down a little but it's a solid 4 overall.  The positive: friendly staff and large portions. Got purple rice with bean sprouts, potatoes, spicy chicken, and all the cold toppings except egg and cheese, and sesame ginger dressing. Everything tasted pretty good, no complaints, and the portions probably rival Chipotle, maybe more. Seems to be a tad healthier feeling than Chipotle too. The space is pretty trendy and definitely arranged with wait longer queueing in mind.  The iffy: would have liked more spice in the chicken and kimchi, but I know that's very subjective. I'd also maybe ask for only half portion of the dressing, although not sure if that would severely cut down on the overall flavor. I'd like to try the steak next time. I'm assuming it's more like galbi than just plain steak?  definitely recommend to everyone to try and definitely recommend as a great alternate to Chipotle when looking for a big, reasonably priced meal! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Kind an Asian chipotle vibe. Certainly not to much like the actual Korean dish, but I was pleasantly surprised. Food was good and serving size was fairly large. The service really stood out though. They answered all my questions about the food and greeted everyone with a welcome when they walk in even though it was super busy."}
{"text":"Wow, it is amazing, they are at the first building in the mall, and I love their food, we had their bowl, and two of their Bibitea, it is amazing. They use the real strawberry and peach in the drink. That's the first time ever in my life. Amazing place."}
{"text":"This place has lost control already, this place is dirty. Chairs and tables are not wiped own. Garbage everywhere. Good concept and the food was promising. Needs a good manager"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place because it has healthy options and it's pretty tasty. I am also Korean, and although it can't compare to the authentic, homemade food I get at home, it's still a quick, tasty fix. I have had Korean food that is 100x better, but that doesn't mean a small bowl of this can't satisfy a little Korean food craving."}
{"text":"I love this place. It has been my go-to place for lunch or dinner whenever I'm feeling hungry or lazy and don't want to cook. I recommend either spicy chicken or steak with white, purple rice or noodles. The noodles are actually my favorite but I like to switch it up sometimes. I love the potatoes and bean sprouts too. Depending on which server you get you might get less or more of meat and condiments. There's always miso soup and best of all it's free! Huge plus :)"}
{"text":"Highly disappointing. Would've given them one star, except the food is cheaper than similar restaurants and decently fresh. It's pretty much korean style Chipotle (build your own bowl). You can get white rice, purple rice, noodles, or lettuce (salad). Protein options are chicken, spicy chicken, steak and tofu. There are a few hot toppings- potatoes, bean sprouts and black beans. And a bunch of cold topping options- daikon, kimchi, cucumber, carrot, kale, lettuce, corn, egg and cheese. Also free miso soup and sauces bar, there are 6 different sauces- cucumber wasabi, teriyaki, yum yum, Korean red, sriracha, and  sesame ginger.   I got a bowl with white rice, chicken (non spicy), all the hot toppings and cold toppings, sauces on the side. Honestly none of the components of the bowl were flavorful and I was highly dissatisfied. I tried all the sauces, they all have some room for improvement. The bowl was warm, likely related to having mostly cold ingredients, but it would've been a lot better if it was served hot (I realize they can't make it in a hot stone pot like Korean bibimbap but still, I did not enjoy it warm with cold toppings). It also wasn't salty enough, especially to be served on a plain rice and multiple raw unseasoned vegetable toppings. I tried adding some soy sauce but it didn't help much, and I didn't want to drown it in soy sauce. None of the 6 sauce options are salty either, most were more sweet or spicy or sweet and spicy. The miso soup was alright, pretty much just a standard miso soup.   I have never eaten somewhere that has been so disappointing and I did not have any amount of enjoyment in this food. I would rather eat chipotle or chapati or subway or mcdonalds or Taco Bell.  Would not go here again ever."}
{"text":"This place was on spot! The dishes were flavorful and they have bubble milk tea too! The food is enough to satisfy your \"umami\" cravings; however, this place serves more american-friendly flavors (not necessarily Korean).  Nevertheless, if you want options as a way of being adventurous, this is the place to be, especially if you like bubble milk tea and other refreshing tea-based drinks with your meal."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out and it was good... its similar to chipotle. build your own bowl or burrito with many option to top"}
{"text":"It is an Asian Fusion Chipotle style chain food place. The booths are space age design. The food was fresh and good. A lot of good roughage. Not much meat. Free unlimited miso soup. The manager said they will be putting one in Cracker Park. I rather just drive out to the east side and eat here. It is cute and depressing seeing all of the young college students full of awe with their lives ahead of them and best days occurring. I am like 2Pac staring at the world through my rearview. Best days are behind. Like Townes Van Zandt I am waiting around to die. I hope the students of Case Western truly enjoy their bibimbap and present moments as they pass. I leave thee with words from Townes Van Zandt on Catfish Song:  Well, all you young ladies Who dream of tomorrow While you're a listenin' These words will I say Cling to today with its joy And its sorrow You'll need all your memories When youth melts away."}
{"text":"WHY THE CONSTANT YELLING?!  I ate here about 3 weeks ago and the food is good - similar to a Korean Chipotle.  They are yelling \"WELCOME TO BIBIBOP!!!\"  Every 20 seconds. Went to try it again a week ago, walked in, got yelled at, turned right around and left. Is this management pushing their employees to do this?  If so stop!  It is annoying!  Nobody wants to hear this nonsense when they are eating!"}
{"text":"Loved these bowls! We ordered takeout for a group and their online system is very streamlined, let's you customize individually, and prints each person's name on their order. I got the spicy chicken with purple rice, potatoes, black beans and all the cold toppings. The potatoes were a nice touch that I haven't had in bibimbop before. Though the bowls were different than typical bibimbop with crispy rice on the bottom, they were delicious. The yum yum sauce and the Korean red sauce amped up the flavor big time! I'll definitely be heading back to grab a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Was overall okay.  More training for the employees, it's not the customers responsibility to know what all the ingredients are, explain to the customer what the ingredients are.  The employees are sure trained to remind that there is an extra for chicken.  Employees also should inform customers that the eatery offers free soups. Also employees should ask are you dining in or take out, not to assume you are dining in and not bag your food.  Eatery was over clean, employees friendly, but not informative.  At least label ingredients."}
{"text":"I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE. SOOOOOO GOOD. The experience has been wonderful the 3 times I've had it thus far. The food is fresh and the service is quick and easy. Not to mention the portions are huge and not expensive at all. And who can be mad about free miso soup?! I enjoy coming here for lunch. It's usually very busy too and the seating is limited- that's the one big downfall."}
