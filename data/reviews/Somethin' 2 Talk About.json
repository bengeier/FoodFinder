{"text":"We live right on the next block from this place. Have walked by this place so many times without knowing it existed. But clearly it is not a secret judging by the stream of people through this place at lunchtime. 

Very friendly family run business. Big menu with lots of vegetarian options which was a plus for my wife. I had the chicken swarma and she had the spicy vege sandwich. 

This is not gourmet food but it is delicious hearty food which is very well priced. Great place and will definitely try again!"}
{"text":"Just got back from my first visit, which landed me an uncommonly delicious red pepper, spinach, and avocado sandwich. You can tell that their bread is very high quality and they use fresh ingredients. Good vibes inside as well. This is a definitely a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"They told me it was a ventilation issue and it hasn't been a problem since, also now they have an app to pay and they accept card but charge a small fee like whatever they are charged. 

I'm glad to know they are listening to their customers and impressed that they cared enough to resolve the problem.
I highly recommend the oatmeal squares they are so yummy."}
{"text":"Great lunch stop if you want a home made lunch experience.  They put in the extra effort and you can taste it.  For example they soak their dried chickpeas and use fresh herbs not dried for their falafel.  Best falafel I have had in the city."}
{"text":"Excellent place for halal meals! By far the biggest selection of sandwiches and burgers, a hidden gem in downtown Toronto. I'm surprised people came here to order chicken sharwma's or falafels considering the variety of sandwiches/wraps/burgers available.

As a Muslim, this place is a great option for lunch!"}
{"text":"Dropped by for the first time today looking for a fast, cheap burger and was honestly surprised! The staff was super friendly and helped me in making a decision as what to eat. The meal was cheap and super filling. I honestly wouldn't recommend ordering fries because their burgers are HUGE."}
{"text":"I'm never eating at the stinkin' hospital again. So good!  Super friendly. Great app so you don't have wait for your falafel (about 10 mins fresh).  Seriously guys"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE.

The name is a tad odd. For the first two months, I followed the lead of a guy in my lab who called it 'The Yellow House'. Once, I was waiting in line for my food and a lady who had just finished her meal came up to the counter to talk about how great it was, and the lovely manager responded with:
\"So it's 'Something 2 Talk About', eh?\"
And I had a giggle fit while I waited for my perfect falafel sandwich.

Hard to find a good halal place and this place is fresh and tasty, with lovely service and a plethora of options. Super super busy at lunch time but if you order ahead of time, the food is ready for pickup."}
{"text":"MOLD ....

Went here at lunch time for a chicken shawarma with hummus. Got back to work and noticed green specs on the pita that seemed a bit suspicious. I asked 4 other co workers their opinion  on it and MOLD was the verdict! Went back to the restaurant and the man ( who I assume is the cook n owner) said it wasn't mold but the cucumber amongst the other ingredients in the pita. Ummmm really (annoyed face).. anyways after the guy was very short n rude with me I just got my money back. However the cashier and the other lady are incredibly nice.. theyre awesome :).

TIP: Check the pita bread before consumption ."}
{"text":"I've been passing this place for years and always thought it was a long-abandoned pizza joint based on the exterior. Imagine my surprise when I found out that this place is not only still in business, but also sells middle-eastern food!

I came here for chicken shawarma during lunchtime. The dark interior wasn't very inviting and the atmosphere was kind of bleak. I immediately spotted a chicken shawarma sandwich on the menu for $5.99, but despite my best efforts couldn't find chicken being roasted on a spit anywhere behind the counter. I did see a roasting spit by the wall, but this equipment wasn't being used at the time. I was hungry and didn't feel like battling the freezing winds outside in search of a new lunch place, so I decided to place an order despite my misgivings. Where did my meat come from? Beats me.

I received my wrap promptly and ventured out back to find a seat. The seating area was pretty small, with a few bar stools and a couple of tables (one of which was occupied by an employee). I enjoyed the food but it was nothing to write home about. The bits of chicken lacked the crispiness you'd expect from roasted meat. I also would've liked more toppings (seriously, no pickles?!). That being said, the garlic sauce and the hot sauce were delicious!"}
{"text":"This hard to find hole-in-the-wall kind of place is a hidden gem. 

Their menu has so many options that it can be hard to choose what to get. During lunch time you will usually see a line of regulars inside, crowded into the little space waiting for their food for take out. 

The food is tasty and service is nice and efficient! Portion sizes tend to be on the bigger side, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Have been to this place a couple of times.  Lots of choices for meat and veggie lovers.

Last time we had:

Provolone, avocado, red pepper, spinach sandwich ($6.75):  Ingredients were fresh, bread was okay, goes pretty well together.  Rating: 3.5/5

BBQ cheese steak ($6.99): This one was okay.  Nothing too special.  Rating: 3/5


They charge an extra 3% for using credit card.  Good place for quick lunch."}
{"text":"I thought it was a great breakfast place, but it turned out that it is a regular Mediterranean sandwich place. I ordered the avocado chicken and it was so normal nothing special and I couldn't finish it, too."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch practically daily. The food is delicious, very reasonably priced, and the staff is super nice.

I'd definitely recommend the shawarma plate. The burgers are incredible as well.

This is probably the best place for breakfast and lunch in the area. Too bad they close at 4:30pm!"}
{"text":"Yum! I stumbled upon this place while looking for a new lunch place around work.  A (bright yellow) little hole in the wall, family-run shop with very friendly staff and healthy, fresh delicious food.  It has a great selection of all kinds of sandwiches, wraps, salads and more.   I could tell I'd hit the jackpot with this place when I noticed the amount of regulars - the cashier knew their order as soon as they walked in.  Now I am in on their secret....   

And this ain't no deli meat sandwich shop - instead picture portobello mushrooms, zucchini, RRPs (roasted red peppers of course) avocado.. I'm not even vegetarian, but the wonderful selection of fresh veggies is such a nice change for a sandwich shop - for example, grilled eggplant?? can't get that at Subway.  The actual restaurant is fairly small and there are only a few places to sit in the back, but it's perfect for grabbing lunch. This place is definitely an unexpected lunch treasure!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches here are fun and different from the usual standard choices . However, you have to know what to order .. Some are hits and some are just terrible ."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years for a reason. Fast, friendly, great value, and I've never been disappointed.  They put a lot of time and effort into their menu, and it shows. Faves include the spicy burger, chicken delight and, on the rare occasions they put it up on the Specials board, the meatball sandwich."}
{"text":"I come here at least 3 times a week for breakfast/lunch. The owners are very friendly and dependable. Food is fresh/homemade/great. And they have an online app to avoid lines. Love this place!"}
{"text":"A seemingly random yellow house and an odd name.
Nevertheless, gave this place a try since it's close to my work pace.

First thing I noticed was a multitude of options on their menu with many options that sounded delicious and would definitely give a try. Prices are definitely more than reasonable.

The wrap itself was good! A great mixture of ingredients that was just right in terms of filling you up. Would come back again to try another sandwich. Overall great experience!

The inside it a little shady and it can get really hot especially on a hot summer day like on my visit. Fortunately there is a patio in the back; however, there are only two tables."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this place. It's not meant to be a dine-in restaurant, so if you're looking for that, keeping walking. What it does have though, is an excellent selection of fresh made sandwiches and wraps, and friendly service to boot! 
I have had multiple dishes here and can honestly say I have enjoyed them all. The portion sizes are great and the meats tender and juicy. It's a busy spot and tailors mostly to lunching employees from the surrounding buildings. Best option is to call ahead and pre order to avoid lineups and confusion. The staff is super attentive and makes each dish with care. 
I really love this place and the price is right!"}
{"text":"Got the mixed shawarma/falafel/rice plate. It was Fantastic. I wish they were open longer hours and on weekends.
Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Hidden off of Bay street this is a place  that make great home style mediterranean food.
My favourites are the shawarma and the spicy burger both are full of flavor and  cooked just right and at a fair price.
Its a family business with great service everyone who works there is super friendly and welcoming.
They even have a app to order food if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and enjoyed it each time. The prices are fair for what you get. I usually get one of the steak sandwiches which are quite a filling size. The menu is pretty big with a variety of food. I really like the steak and the fact that there is a good portion of it, I often find that many steak sandwiches barely have a good portion so that was awesome! The staff was really friendly and I felt welcomed. There isn't much space to sit so it's more of a to-go place. I went around 2 pm so it wasn't really busy. Overall I really like this place, its a convenient location for me (walking distance from school) and I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken shawrma plate with rice and salad.chicken was dry and rice was plain blant. Only thing I like the garlic sauce."}
{"text":"I dropped by today for a quick lunch on the way to a doctor's appointment nearby. I had the lunch platter with falafel, chicken, chickpeas and salad. It came to around $10 including tax and the portions were huge, so quite good value for money.

The staff here are very friendly and advised that my meal would take a few minutes while the falafel was being cooked. As I waited, I surveyed the other patrons and it seemed that a lot of them were regulars and know the staff quite well. This is always a good sign.

There is a small amount of seating inside the restaurant and a decent sized patio out back so you can enjoy your lunch in the sunshine. I found the lighting a bit dim inside, but maybe that's just me.

In terms of the food itself, it was very tasty and fresh. The falafel was piping hot and the tandoori chicken (I asked for this instead of shawarma chicken) was very good too. The hot sauce they put on the rice and falafel was not too spicy and had a bit of a sweet taste too, which was refreshing. The chickpeas and salad were also very tasty..

I will be dropping by soon to try the other items on the menu, including the cajun chicken. Their specials menu changes regularly so there is always something new to try. A solid four star lunch spot that is a bit off the beaten track and (for now) not too busy."}
{"text":"For Halal-friendly meats and vegetarian sandwiches, Somethin' is a weird little place easy for lunch from Bay or University employees.  
I had a period when I ate Falafel for a lot of meals and since then I've just not been in the mood. So, I usually head there for the $5 big sandwich rolls stuffed with cold or warm veggies like fresh and sun-dried tomoatoes, roasted eggplant. The owners are friendly and don't mind if you eat in or take out. 
Hot plates of rice and meats also available."}
{"text":"Don't let the yellow brick and shabby interior fool you (they renovated the interior a bit which looks way better). This place is fantastic! Food is consistently good and they use good quality ingredients and meats in their sandwiches. Staff are very very friendly and a majority of their patrons are regulars. Good value for money, only gripe is the limited seating but in the summer they have a patio and you can sit outside in the small courtyard."}
{"text":"Tried this place because of the great reviews. The place is tiny and was really busy but the cashier was really nice/friendly and kept everyone moving. Was surprised at the 3% fee for paying with anything but cash (I almost never have cash with me) but I do get that it could keep costs down. I had the shawarma with hummus. Good price ($8 with tax) with decent size and taste but it was not a traditional shawarma - more like a chicken breast wrap with hummus. Would come back and try something else next time as there seemed to be many regular customers coming in."}
{"text":"Good place to come for take out.  

An assortment of Mediterranean food: wraps, sandwiches, burgers, rice dishes.

It's a bit of a hole in the wall and they only have 2 small tables in the back for u to sit.  

Came here on a friday during lunch hour and there was a bit of a line.  I had the chicken shawarma ($7), and it was definitely one of the better tasting chicken shawarmas I've had before - quite juicy and the sauce was very good.

Cash or debit/credit (3% charge)."}
{"text":"This is more of a takeout spot as there is minimal seating here. It seems quite popular as there was always a lineup during the lunch hours. This was an unplanned visit and as wanted to grab something quick. Plenty of options on the menu and several vegetarian offerings as well. I settled with the steak sandwich with BBQ and a side of fries. Fries were nice and warm.  The serving is a good portion. Taste is OK as I would rate it a bit over food court level. Odd thing is there is a surcharge for non cash payments (even interac). Priced very reasonably though I I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"Great place for fast, delicious Schwarmas! I'm a big fan.

Located just west of Bay on Gerrard, this hidden gem always has a line at lunch time. The service is great and food is flavourful.

I typically order the Chicken Schwarma ($5.99). Lots of vegetarian options and the fries are fantastic. 

About 3 small tables to sit out back.

Good tip:  stock up on napkins as the fully packed wrap always ends up dripping (maybe on pants)!"}
{"text":"The woman at the counter recommended the wrap with portobellos and eggplant. Had that, and loved it. Very limited seating but there was room for me on a stool. Lots of choices on the menu, so that's why I asked."}
{"text":"Fresh falafel at a very reasonable price. Excited to be in the neighbourhood again to eat this!"}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews, and was disappointed.

Ordered a chicken shawrama--a staple--and asked for the chicken to be well done, they couldn't for some reason... and when I ate it, it tasted like it's been sitting out cold forever. The sauces were gross and overpowering. Could only finish half before getting grossed out.

Staff seemed friendly, but I defintely won't be spending my money here again. Plus, heard they're moving."}
{"text":"A very small and hidden place on gerrard a little bit west of bay street. This place is only open Monday through Friday and closes everyday by 4 pm. 

The owners are quite friendly and will explain to you whatever you needed. Each time I go I always get the Shwarma chicken platter.  Comes with chicken Shwarma pieces, rice, salad, humus and their garlic sauce. The portion of the chicken is not very much but the garlic sauce is super delicious here. My fiancee got the tandoori chicken wrap with fries and that was very tasty with a little kick in spice. Fries though we're an extra cost from the wrap.

Overall it does get very busy especially during the lunch time on a weekday so be sure to go either earlier or a little later to best the rush. Prices are fair.  My Shwarma platter is about 10$"}
{"text":"Almost walked right by this place trying to find it. It's super tiny and during lunch hour it was extremely packed. It seems family run and all the staff were very friendly, outgoing and helpful. I ordered one of the beef burgers (forgot which one) with a side of fries. I should have mentioned that I prefer my burger well done but was too lazy to let them know afterwards. It was a light pink on the inside so make sure to mention if you like it any different. Nevertheless it was still amazing and all the flavours with the cheese worked really well. The portion is huge and I ended up finishing my fries for dinner. Very little seating in the back with some stools and a table. But I recommend opening the back door because there is a micro version of a patio with two more tables and chairs available if the ones inside are full and its nice there because its covered and quiet (unlike the loud kitchen and customers inside) Overall would recommend this place and II hope to try some of their other items."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches for takeout for a group, a staple for our group meetings. The shaheen are especially great."}
{"text":"Wasn't a good experience. The salad in the rice dish is horrible and the rice is unexpectedly bad. The chicken is okay but it is a bit dry."}
{"text":"These guys are just like family to so many of us locals in the neighbourhood.  After 20 years they are closing due to landlord not renewing their lease. They have fead so many of us and the food has always been made with so much care and love.  Hopeful you have had the pleasure of eating or taking out from these guys as it's just like home cooking.  Tomorrow is their last day open here.  So if you haven't tried, it's a must before they close their doors."}
{"text":"1 star for the friendly cashier, and 1 star for the salad.

Ordered Brie, portobello mushroom burger with side of house salad on a weekday around 1pm. There were two people waiting for their orders and the lighting was so dim that I needed to look at the menu really closely to see what's written on the blackboard. I didn't see any seating in the back cuz it was too dark, so I left the place right after I got my order.

The beef patty itself was bland, the mushroom was average, and the Brie was COLD (the burger was pretty much just warm too). I waited for a while for them to cook and expected melted cheese and hot burger, but even the shape of the cheese looked like they just took it out of the package and put it on my burger.
The salad was fresh and delicious tho."}
{"text":"I find it hard to find a good healthy breakfast in this area. This place has really good egg wraps, and always great customer service, and I like how I can order ahead of time on their app!"}
{"text":"Where do I even start. First off the food, the most important part of any restaurant, simply put: it is absolutely fantastic. The menu consists of mostly sandwiches and wraps with a few fresh salads, and rice dishes as well. The food is prepared in front of your eyes, the ingredients are fresh and most importantly, extremely delicious. Everything is extremely reasonably priced as well. I highly recommend the \"shaheen steak sandwich\", a massive (seriously huge) sandwich filled with sliced steak, a variety of cheeses, toppings like sautéed onions and tomatoes, and signature sauces, I've never tasted a sandwich so good. The service is great too. The restaurant is a family owned business in the truest sense. An extremely down to earth bunch with a great sense of humor  who'll treat you like a regular on your first visit.

A cozy, friendly atmosphere, coupled with delicious food at unreasonably low prices makes this is definitely a spot everyone should check out. I live in Mississauga and would make the trip just to eat here. In fact I come here weekly"}
{"text":"Who ever reviewed this place before me doesn't have any taste buds. While at sick kids hospital we wanted a change of the cafeteria food. I went to my \"trusted\" yelp app and this place popped up. Maybe it's what I ordered but everything sucked pretty bad. We got the steak sandwiches and chicken souvlaki. Both weren't good."}
{"text":"Went with a group of people last week cause we wanted to try something new.
The food was overdone, the rice was still hard and the food tasted bland. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Ordered a business lunch to a customers office ahead of time. Ahdela handled everything perfectly well and made sure the food was delivered on time and hot. My clients loved it and said how this was the best lunch they've ever had brought in. So good. Sadly, as a good host I had to leave the leftovers behind!"}
{"text":"A hidden hole-in-the-wall type resto! A great selection of wraps and sandwiches, and the bread is delicious!

Everything has a generous filling of meat (tender juicy flavourful) and veggies (fresh!), topped with the right amount of sauce. I still need to try their rice dishes!

Looks like a lot of regulars here that get along well with the friendly staff. A local delight for sure."}
{"text":"Everyone knows why it's good food here fresh ingredients from real farms at a reasonable price. Wish they were open weekends though."}
{"text":"I just tried this place this week. I bought chicken swarma wrap and the chicken  dinner with salad. The food was just ok. I think the portions are small and this place is over rated. I would not come back here. I think Ali Ba Ba's close by close to Yonge/Dundas is a lot better with better portions & quality. I only went there because my co-workers said it was amazing & very good. My friend & husband who tried the food here also said it was just ok and over rated also."}
{"text":"Let me just first start off by saying I forgot to take a picture of my meal today! Reason being was that I was busy talking with friends and it simply slipped my mind that I needed to take a picture for my Yelp review afterwards. But please take my word for it and believe me that I went to this place for lunner today! 

I ordered the tandoori chicken with chickpea salad, rice, and Greek salad. The chickpea salad was very nicely dressed, very tasty, nothing to complain about. The Greek salad was also nicely dressed, not bitter-tasting, nice sweet and sour vinaigrette. However, definitely not a traditional Greek salad. They should just call it a \"salad\" to avoid offending the real Greeks. Now, the rice was also good BUT the chicken... It was very salty unfortunately. To be honest, it was salty AND dry. I was hoping that it would be the star of the dish but it turned out to disappoint. It was salty to the point where I chugged down 3 bottles of water within a 2 hour time period after. 

I also got a spoonful of hot sauce and yoghurt on the side which was alright. The hot sauce was INTERESTING to say the least because it was hot but also sweet and NOT sour like tabasco. The yoghurt was nice, a little bit too salty especially with that super salty chicken. However it cleansed the palette pretty well.  

Because of the chicken I am giving this review 4 stars, if I had the option I would probably give it 3.5 stars. But the other items were good and I look at everything on that platter with equal importance! Even though I truly hoped that chicken would be bomb."}
{"text":"Sad to see this family-run little hole-in-the-wall close after being the reliable lunch option for the office crew for so many years. They have obviously formed many relationships with they usual patrons and are friendly to new faces even up to the last day. Extra star for the community attitude and service.

I had their chicken shawarma wrap and it was grilled until piping hot. The meat was moist and had a good selection of veggies wrapped inside. A simple, easy, and on-the-go lunch option.... but no more :("}
{"text":"This place is right outside my workplace, and it's ALWAYS packed here. Nicknamed \"Yellow House\" because it's painted a BRIGHT yellow outside. 

I'm just surprised that there aren't more Yelpers writing about this place (or maybe we just don't have enough Yelpers in the hospital area -- time to recruit)!  Anyhow, food is  delicious. I usually get the \"Schwarma special\" - which includes schwarma, everything delicious, and their yummy hummus. You can also get it spicy with onions. Delish.

I promise one day that I will try something new.

Great service as well - always a friendly smile in there. No complaints!

P.S. This is a place where you want to get take-out. I know there's a place where you can sit in the back - but I've never ventured there."}
{"text":"Very fresh assortment of burgers, steak, and chicken shawarma sandwiches.

You cannot go wrong with the Jalapeño and Mozzarella Steak Sandwich.  Huge portion with plenty of steak, red peppers, and arugula, along with a house make Jalapeño pepper sauce.  This thing is spicy (and for those real heaters, they can make it even spicier, but beware.)

The chef/owner is very pleasant and friendly.

I've also had the chicken shawarma with hummus, this sandwich is outstanding as well.  The potato wedges are freshly prepared.

If you're in the area, looking for an affordable lunch, do stop by!  I just wish they were open on the weekend! Only open M-F 8-4 pm :("}
{"text":"This place is small and doesn't look like much, but they're wonderful. 
The people who work there are friendly and quick and try to remember you too (which is nice) 
I've had two of their chicken wraps and both have been delicious. 
The hot sauce is perfect, chicken is cooked wonderfully, the wraps are done properly and stay together as you eat (this I find a lot of other places have problems with) 
It's not expensive (6somethig for a very filling wrap) and it's made with healthy fresh ingredients too
I recommend 
Also- they have an app so you can preorder. Which is cool."}
{"text":"Hidden little restaurant in the \"Yellow House\" on Bay & Gerrard. I was not expecting this place to be this great! They have a large variety of delicious sandwiches and wraps, using what seems to be fresh ingredients every time. Don't let the low price lead you into underestimating the quantity either, because the sandwiches are huge! Always something new to choose each time, and I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  Love this place when grabbing a quick bite at lunch time.

Highly recommend the shawarma extra toasted.  The wedge fries are crispy and delicious.  The daily homemade soups are amazing and prices are very reasonable.

Limited seating available so arrive before the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I came back here and ended up going with the chicken, pear, and brie wrap with onions and hot sauce. After ordering I thought I might regret the hot sauce and onions with this particular wrap but no way! Super tasty with some kind of caesar/garlic/parm sauce on it. YUMMMM. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is prepared fresh and made with love and care. The staff are extremely friendly and kind. Because everything is prepped fresh, there can be a bit of a wait, but it is well worth it. Seating is limited. The place itself is nothing impressive to look at. But the food is spectacular. The falafels are made to order on the spot and are to die for. The lineups frequently go out the door, but they get through it pretty quick."}
{"text":"The \"Yellow House\" is one of my favourite lunch spots in the neighbourhood. They have delicious food, good service, and a huge variety of options. 

Their falafels are amazing, freshly made when you order, and nice and crispy on the outside. Other great items are the Chicken and Goat Cheese wrap, Provolone Portobello Steak wrap and Shaheen Steak sandich. Their chicken shawarma does tend to be a bit dry, so get it with humus or extra sauce. 

The owners are also really nice and friendly. They even give out free treats to the regulars on holidays :)

Just note that it can get really busy at lunch time so I highly recommend ordering through their app, so you can just quickly pick up and go. However, service is still pretty fast."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just not part of the conversation...reviews for Somethin' 2 Talk About are generally high, but my experience if mediocre at best. 

Located in a narrow townhouse along Gerard Street West, you might walk right by Somethin' 2 Talk About if you were actually engaged in a real conversation. Walk in and you're hit with a wave of smokey-greasiness, which bodes ill if you're ordering falafel, like I did.

. Apart from a few scattered stools at the window, diners are herded into a greasy dark warren at the back of the restaurant with sticky tables and hard wooden seats. A TV blares the local news channel. Groups of university students compete to see who can talk loudest. There's a cute patio out back, which is great during our 2.5 weeks of summer. Most people get their meals to go.They are smart. 

To order, you must find the cashier. Hint: he's located about 1/3 the way into the restaurant, in front of the sweaty dude who's actually cooking. To make a full order, you elbow your way through the crowd, tell him what you want, then mill back and forth collecting pop (jealously guarded), paper napkins, and a haphazard fistful of plastic cutlery. Listen carefully for them to call out your order-although without taking my name, or giving numbers this can involve a bit of guesswork (or a luncheon surprise). 

The food itself is cheap. I'll spare you a cost vs. value rant and tell you we're thoroughly on the cost side, here. My poor falafel is a bare bones affair. crumbly golf-ball sized patties that taste exclusively of salt; browning lettuce and white-cored tomato; a roadkill smear of garlicky mayo, eaten in loud darkness. The building used to be someone's home. I venture a trip to the only washroom up a flight of rickety stairs. I imagine people died here. 

Like i said, the food is cheap. Don't be a cheapskate. Eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Sauce was cold in the beef sandwich. Also I found some hair in my Greek salad; I wouldn't go back here. Kinda hidden, definitely not a gem."}
