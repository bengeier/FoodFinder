{"text":"Love their pizza, its my favorite.  Mostly good experiences except last time they put pepperoni on the whole pizza instead of half."}
{"text":"Came here because it was close to the hotel I'm staying at and my son wanted pizza.  I am glad I did. The staff was friendly and even catered to my 3 year old son when he wanted to buy a water. The pizza was GREAT! Gets a thumbs up from my son (who is a pizza expert) as well as my self. The crust was just right and perfect amount of toppings and sauce... Not to mention all the locals who placed there orders ahead of time cause they already know this place is YUMMY!!!! I will bookmark this spot so when I come out here again."}
{"text":"Damn good pizza and a good price. Delivery has been 25 minutes to 45 minutes, so no complaint. They coat the pizza with a crapload of toppings, which makes me keep ordering from them. Order from them and you can't go wrong. If you don't like this pizza you are probably communist."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite pizza! I've been coming here since high school (2002) and have never been disappointed! I don't live close ( about a 45 minute drive) but I totally make the drive just for the pepperoni pizza. The prices are very fair and the staff is always friendly and welcoming!! I highly recommend this place and always will!! You guys are my fave!!"}
{"text":"Garden of Eating is currently my default pizzeria because of its proximity to home and satisfactory quality of product. In comparison to the best pizzas I've ever had, the garden ranges from good to very good, but not great. One of my big hang ups here is with their cook-time consistency ... Sometimes it's done perfectly, others it's slightly underdone for my tastes. I've never asked for them to cook it a little longer because I don't want an overdone pizza, either. Their Italian subs and tossed salads are consistently very good with fresh ingredients. All-in-all, a worthy eatery."}
{"text":"Four of us in the office ordered takeout so we could continue working and not leave the office. We all ordered sandwiches. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak with extra lettuce. It had no lettuce. The vegetarian got meat on his sandwich.  Not sure if all this was ordered wrong, made wrong, or delivered wrong. The sandwich did have fresh bread and was still warm. The meat was not plentiful. I'd try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"I am fairly new to the area but this place is my favorite.  We have tried all the local spots and NO ONE even comes close to how good this place is.  Staff is polite, efficient and friendly.  Food is GREAT!  You cannot ask for more!"}
{"text":"In the Oakdale/Imperial part of town there's a lot of mom & pop pizza shops, easily within a 10 minute drive of my apartment there's at least 6 independently own places.  And to my knowledge there's at least 1 chain-based shop that is further than 10 minutes but they do deliver.  Having said all that, and having eaten at all 6 local places...I can say my new favorite is Garden of Eating.  When you walk in, it shows the place has been there for a while.  Nothing fancy but it is clean and the staff is attentive.  You can dine-in, take-out, or place a delivery order over the phone.  I've ordered delivery and I've placed take-out orders and both times the time it took for the food was fast for the method chosen.  The food itself is grade A quality.  The cheeses and the meats on the Pizza taste like they should, and the sauce is the best sauce in the area.  (One of the reasons why my former fave is now #2 is because GoE's pizza sauce is that much better).  And their bread-sticks are awesome! (I'm a bread-a-holic).  I have tried their subs, it was good...aside from the chicken being a little dry, but that's not a big deal since the veggies were fresh and crisp and the bread was again amazing.  They don't have online ordering...which is a bummer, but they do take credit cards and they'll honor their coupon prices if you call in an order rather than present the coupon in person, so that's pretty good too.  Overall, this place is definitely a winner so anyone in the area looking for a good slice of pizza and some bread-sticks should definitely give Garden of Eating a try."}
{"text":"I was actually looking for the police station pizza they opened in robinson, but couldnt find. So, I went out of my way because this place had good reviews. It sucked. So many other great pizza places closer to where I live in the city. I guess its good drunk food. But seriously dont waste your time."}
{"text":"One of our favorite pizza places in the area. Always hot, fresh...and delicious (exceptionally good sauce) pizza! They even know my husband's name when he calls...Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is awful.   I ordered a white pizza with ham.  I got home and the pizza didn't have ham on it.   I told them the next time I was in and they didn't seem to care and they didn't offer anything to make up for it.   Then I ordered a steak pizza.  They have 2 different steak pizzas.   I called and told them I got the wrong one, they just said they have 2 types of steak pizzas and I got the special.   I wanted the philly cheese steak.  They never offered to give me the one I wanted.  We use to get pizza every Friday.  We'll be finding a new place to get pizza."}
{"text":"For a pizza joint this place pumps out really good pizza. Crust is just right, and the ingredients are quality. Heard hoagies and salads are really good and abundant portions are provided .   Modestly priced, relatively clean, nothing fancy. Nice touch locals rave about garden of eating... And I can admit it, for good reason because it's damn good"}
{"text":"Yum!  Was looking for a delivery option in the area and saw this place through Yelp and decided to give it a try.  We ordered a medium chicken version of the Hawaiian pizza (chicken and pineapple).  Delivery took about 45 minutes and there were 8 slices in the medium from what I remember.  It was more than enough for two people to share.    I typically like my pizza crust thin but occassionally I don't mind a thicker crust.  This place makes the Goldilocks of pizza crust, it wasn't too thin and it wasn't too thick, but just right!  The toppings were out of control - they put a healthy heap of chicken and pineapple evenly distributed across the pizza palette.  Every bite had a piece of chicken and pineapple - now that's how a pizza should be.    They don't skimp on toppings and the pizza didn't skimp on taste!  If you're looking for some darn good pizza, definitely give this place a call or stop by."}
{"text":"I order here all the time pizzais great, Higgins are great and staff is great! Nothing but good service"}
{"text":"I found this place based on geography, and I am glad that I did.  I ordered a ricotta calzone, and it was very reasonably priced considering that it was gigantic (and only the medium).  Easily enough for two people or even three for lighter appetites.  Called them on a not very busy night, and it was ready when I arrived 15 minutes later.  Came with a big thing of sauce and a generous amount of parmesan packets.  Cashier was friendly; food was very good (two meals!); prepared fast.  I believe they only take cash because the entrance mentioned that there's an ATM inside, but I was paying cash and didn't pay attention otherwise.  Bottomline: Worth a shot at least for a calzone.  I can't vouch for the pizza, but I may end up trying some before I leave next week."}
{"text":"Great local pizza shop. You actually get the toppings you pay for! Well worth the price! Decent for a local pizza shop, staff could be friendlier."}
{"text":"SOLID pizza!!! Recommended by a colleague who frequents this place with his family and am very glad to have tried their pizza. Their mushroom pizza is delectable!!! Will order from again!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up going to this pizza shop. I used to ride my bike there as a kid and fold pizza boxes for free slices of pizza and worked there for 7 years throughout high school and college. Of course I may have a little bias but you can not find a better pizza shop for many many miles nearby and truthfully you may not. The dough is the some of the best I've ever had, the sauce is great and the smoky provolone cheese tops off the perfect pizza they make. I live in the Tampa Florida area now and you can not even find a pizza shop that comes close to the quality of pizza they have here. There's something about the overall ingredients that separate them from the competition. The hoagies and calzones are also amazing. Try dipping any of your crust in your Coke or Dr Pepper (Definitely weird I know.... But delicious)! Even more-so when they used to have crushed ice."}
{"text":"This spot is bomb!!! It's a little hidden but it's a great hole in a wall spot. I got the Cajun chickens salad and that was delicious.. My buddies tried other stuff and they loved it as well!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza but sometimes have problems with no one answering the phone ~ it's very frustrating!"}
{"text":"I've read other reviews and figured I'd give this place a try. This place is approximately 5 minutes from me. Customer service when ordering, good.  Customer service upon delivery, good. The delivery guy was friendly.  Pizza and breadsticks were hot. Delivery time from ordering, 55 minutes.  Quality of the pizza, it was good, but not the best I've ever had. 3 out of 5 for pizza. I may or may not order again."}
