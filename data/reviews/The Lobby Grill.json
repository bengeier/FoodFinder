{"text":"Food was reasonable. Steak was good but nothing special. Not worth $32. My wife had fish special, was very small piece and average at best. Son had rotisserie chicken. It was reasonably good, but not worth $24.  Biggest Reason for 3 stars is poor service. They charge similar to morton's  prices but quality of food and service is not even on par w Denny's.  I realize it's a hotel restaurant, but would not eat here again unless it were just for a burger, and then the service would not cut it."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service! The Cobb salad I had was nice but took a really long time to arrive. We were seated in a sparsely occupied patio and waited 15 minutes to even be acknowledged. If you can't spend an hour or more at lunch, be ready to order everything you want PLUS the check when you are seated. Trying to get the waitress to return was nearly impossible! I thought this would have been a one-time miss-step but it was the same situation for the 2 breakfasts I had to have there as well!
My suggestion to the restaurant, as well as the hotel, is to GET RID OF THE FAKE PLANTS AND FLOWERS that are EVERYWHERE!!! They are dusty and nasty and THIS is ARIZONA for GOD'S sake, not ALASKA!!!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced typical \"hotel fancy food\" that isn't fancy or particularly good"}
{"text":"Total disappointment. The food was okay but the service was ridiculous.  The only way they stay in business is the captive resort audience. We waited for 30 minutes for a table for dinner during which I counted about 15+ open tables in the restaurant!  The majority of tables were open and still a 30 minute wait and very poor service. Total bummer!"}
{"text":"The Lobby Grill is incredibly overpriced and the food isn't close to as good as it ought to be for the prices they charge.  
Our server who waited on us was was very friendly but we were right next to the server station so when she would leave our table we had the \"pleasure\" of hearing her and the other servers gossip.  Not professional, and not ok.  
We were provided with complementary chips and dip which were very tasty.  Unfortunately, that was where the tastiness ended.  Our dinners were awful.  
My husband had a steak which was about the quality you would expect from applebees, only it was 26.95.  That doesn't sound like much but it was an awful steak, very fatty, not cooked well and with almost no flavor.  And that was just for the steak - the sides are a la carte.  So we ordered the mac n cheese for 6.25 which was ok but had some kind of funky cheese in it that gave it a slightly weird taste.  It was probably the best part of the meal but no something I would ever order again.  I had the cobb salad for 15.25 and that was a huge let down.  Dressing was gross, chicken was gross, overall it was just sub par.  
We decided to make up for the rest of the meal with some dessert.  Maybe not the best idea....
My husband ordered an espresso (4.25) that came half full and cold.  We also ordered the chocolate chip cookie desert for 8.25 which was pretty good except that the icecream was caramel ribbon (or something caramel) which was way too sweet to go with the cookie.  Plain vanilla would have been much better, the dish was entirely too sweet and this is coming from two individuals with HUGE sweet tooths.  
Long story short, this restaurant is overpriced and the food is not good.  I would never go back and I would never recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"My burger was burnt Onion rings burnt pretty disappointing
I was hoping for better quality 
The hotel is beautiful"}
{"text":"decent, not awesome. I went with a deal sort of like groupon-ish."}
{"text":"One of the best views in Phoenix and good decor. Food and service good but not excellent."}
{"text":"Artichoke not cooked till tender and calamari we wondered if it was even cooked.  Although staff was accommodating and removed from the bill so we'll give three stars for local IPA and view of golf course and staff accommodation. We didn't have lunch just starters so no comment for lunch.  The effort was there but the food could use some attention.  I hope this helps the chef improve cuz the location is very nice.."}
{"text":"Was just in and had zero service. She brought me a menu and never came back to my table. Not sure 1 person serving the entire place is a good idea!!! Shit and I gotta stay at this resort for the next 8 days!!! Ugh"}
{"text":"The service was pretty slow, but once we mentioned it the bartender came over and took care of us. She was wonderful. My quinoa salad was great, and so was breakfast the day before.  Everyone we were here with this weekend said the food there was great."}
{"text":"This place is located inside of Arizona Grand Resort.  It's definitely resort/hotel food.  I can't imagine anyone wanting to dine here that wasn't staying in the resort or working on site as I am.  My new co- workers and I decided to try Lobby Grill because we're all new to area.  It was about 5 of us in our party.  During prime lunch time (noon) we were the only patrons in the restaurant.  
2 of us ordered the very expensive Chicken Cobb Salad (18.50 a pop).  The Chicken Cobb Salad comes with Shaved Iceberg, Rotisserie Chicken, Bacon, Avocado, Bleu Cheese, Tomato, Scallions, Hard-Boiled Egg, Derby Dressing.  It's important to note that the salad dressing is mixed in the salad when you order it.  I asked for my salad dressing on the side.  According to our server, The Derby Dressing is a mix of Thousand Island and Honey Mustard.  I declined that and asked for blue cheese dressing instead.  My co-worker ordered the salad as is and loved it.  The salad is HUGE and pretty tasty.  The only down side for me were the pieces of gristle in the chicken and throughout the salad.  I was literally spitting some out in every bite.  Because of that I wouldn't order it again. 

One co-workers order a Caesar Salad with Grilled Salmon (he liked it). Another person order the #1 Ahi Poke Bowl and loved it.  It was pretty, had flowers in it and all.  Someone else ordered The Club with fries and loved it. Hey, you can't go wrong with a Club Sandwich right?! The only soup they had was tomato basil bisque which is a menu item.  No soup of the day or anything.  
Overall, there was nothing special at all about the place and I wouldn't bother returning unless it's on the company's dime."}
{"text":"Don't know the problem people have with this place but from start to finish the service, food, and drink were outstanding.  Waitress was on her toes and gave us excellent recommendations.  Will go back tommorrow just for the food.  Yum"}
{"text":"This was just awful. We were seated inside a nearly empty dining room for breakfast. The waitress eventually came around and brought our drinks. Coffee and a fork to stir for me. We placed our food order. Then waited. And waited. Finished our drinks. No refills. When the food finally arrived I figured out why it took so long:  they were blackening the bacon. Yep, they served us totally black bacon!  Yuck!  No apologies for the wait or anything. My son was still hungry after his kids pancake. (He wouldn't eat the bacon.). So we bought him a pastry in the gift shop after our $50 family breakfast. Will not return."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and the service was okayyyy....First thing is they have these fake plants on the table that really need to be dusted off they are filthy. Waiter was okay Quinoa corn salad was excellent I must say. Prices are decent for what you get. I went there for dinner the next day and I waited 25 minutes to get my food and the restaurant was not full. 10 minutes to get a straw which I asked 3 different people for and 15 minutes for a check. Service was not good at all but the corn Quinoa salad is Superb!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Came to Phoenix on a business trip, and I like to try out different places. Good food is a must, and great view/decor/ambience makes it better. Read the reviews from other yelpers and saw the so so reviews for this place. I noticed that none said bad food, so I decided to try it. I'm very glad I did. 

I started with the grilled artichoke appetizer, and my entree was the Cobb salad (here for lunch). Both were super tasty and yummy. I liked the way the food was presented, it looked really good. That's always nice. 

I requested to be sat by the window, and my view was of the golf course, with the ponds and waterfalls. It was very pretty, and made for an excellent setting to enjoy lunch. 

Also, the service was very good. The waiter was very attentive, refilled my drink on time ( a HUGE plus with me), got the food to me in a timely manner, and he checked up on me often. So maybe the other reviewers were there at busier times, or had a different waiter. 

Over all, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good food in a pretty, relaxing setting."}
{"text":"Up there for best hotel restaurant for sure. Great views and kids can run and play while you relax and eat. Food was great and service attentive. I appreciated the vegan option as well!"}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Arizona Grand Resort for a business conference and got in early enough for breakfast. I was greeted by the hostess and seated outside so I could take in the amazing view. I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was delicious. The service was both prompt and friendly. It is obvious that there is a focus on service here as there was plenty of wait staff. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Can you give zero stars?  Absolutely the worst ran restaurant I've ever been to especially at a beautiful resort!  Servers have no clue and in three visits during our stay not once was food or drinks prepared properly. And after simply bringing it to staffs attention we were told we were wrong!  Unreal, stay here but save yourselves and don't ever eat here!!"}
{"text":"Want high prices for regular bar food with non-existent service at a high end resort? Then come to the Lobby Grill. The only reason people come here is because it's in the lobby. They pigeonholed that market. Good for them. When you have no competition, you can apparently do whatever you want. That includes charging a lot and taking hours to serve customers, while never checking in with them throughout their meal. I waited an hour for my food, later to find out my waitress forgot to place my order with the cook."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Carne asada steak was tuff,  very unattentive, not accommodating in the least."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the grilled shrimp caesar salad.  Bartenders gave fabulous service."}
{"text":"Food is delicious but the service was absolutely terrible!!!! Especially in the evening. When we went during lunch, the food came out quick. 
But last night was just terrible!
We went to the hostess to request a table for two, the restaurant wasn't even that packed..there were so many seats open. 
But it took them 10min to \"clear our table\" which was already clear (we could see it from the entrance).
We got seated and waited at least 10min for someone to come. The waiter asked for our drink order and told him we were ready to order our dinner. He goes \"I'm just here for drinks..let me check with the other tables and will come back for your order\". We didn't understand why he couldn't just take our order and put it in...he was gone for 15min and he finally came back to take our orders and brought our drinks. My friend had asked for a straw and he said okay, walked away.. We asked another waitstaff for a straw, they said okay and walked away...then the manager comes up and we asked her for a straw but again she said I'll be back and never came back. It's a straw, how hard is it to get one???

Food came 30min later..and the food was great. I ordered the grilled corn and quinoa salad. Once they took our plates away, we asked for the check..and my friend ordered another beer. It took them another 20min just to bring the check and they forgot about the beer. 

All I can say was that service was SLOW!!!!! 
They didn't come back to check on us to see how we were doing, no refresh on drinks...they weren't friendly either!
If you're staying at the Arizona Grand I wouldn't dine here..go somewhere else or order it to go."}
{"text":"Front of house really needs to be overhauled. The wait for no particular reason was excessive. Once seated everything else was fine.  We chose to go basic and stuck to the wood fired pizzas.  These are a great choice if not looking for anything fancy. Coupled with a nice merlot our dinner was fine.  Don't look for anything extraordinary and you won't be disappointed.  Basic foods but nice."}
{"text":"Trash place. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone and they're slow with their service..... .. .. .. .."}
{"text":"Typical hotel breakfast buffet in terms of food quality and price. The meats were overcooked and the breads tasted grocery-store bought. We only ate here because we had vouchers. Otherwise the price would be prohibitive. The staff was friendly but terribly slow. The only saving grace is the outdoor seating and the view of the golf course is a pretty one. I would only recommend this restaurant as an option for those staying in the Arizona Grand, and want the convenience of eating in the hotel. Otherwise, you are much better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food with options for everyone.  The kids got pizza and it was great.  I had a turkey sandwich that was basically a thanksgiving dinner in your hands.
The only downer was we had to wait a while for a table as the staff could not handle a large party of 16."}
{"text":"I was excited to meet a friend at the AZ Grand and made the horrific mistake of assuming a resort would have great food.

Let me say this - you can eat better food at one of Phoenix's area hospitals than this place!

The \"heirloom board\" didn't even have heirloom tomatoes on it.  It came w/ only 4 small pieces of bread so our table of four only had 1 piece of bread each to try the dab of pesto, garden tomatoes (which were not ripe), 3 slices of salami, and watery mozzarella.  

The Rotisserie Chicken had no flavor, was dry, and could pass for boiled chicken.  Finally the mash potatoes... yeah watered down and flavorless.  

I WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK AFTER THIS TERRIBLE MEAL.  THERE WAS A REASON WHY THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT WAS EMPTY!  I SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THIS!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast might be the worst deal $24 buffet for soggy scrambled eggs, potatoes, pancakes, bacon, and sausage. The view outside is nice but beyond that no value. Any fast food breakfast would have tasted better. Hotel management should be embarrassed of a resort of this quality to offer meals like this."}
{"text":"W just returned from the Lobby Grill and boy what a major disappointment! Not a good way to start off our vacation here at the Arizona Grand Resort. Our food took 45 minutes to arrive at the table. My daughter's salmon on her salad was mostly raw. The portion on my rotisserie chicken was pretty meager considering it cost $30. Our server did not communicate very well with us and we had to ask for more water several times and when the food was taking too long we had to go up and ask what the status was. It's the role of the server to communicate with us and let us know how much longer and so forth. The food was overpriced too but I expected as much at a resort like this but we expected much more in quality of service and food."}
{"text":"The Lobby Grill is not out of this world but it's not bad either. The food is acceptable...definitely not delicious but it is just fine. The service is pretty good; both servers we had on our two visits were friendly and attentive but not so much so that it gets annoying. The ambiance and look of the restaurant are nice. Depending on where you're sitting, you keep them have a nice view of the golf course/fountain/waterfall. I would say this is a good option if you're looking for classic American food without leaving the Arizona Grand Resort property."}
{"text":"Presents itself as a high end restaurant and isn't.  The best item on the table was the Sangria - also very potent (maybe a bit much even).  The Ahi & Crab tower was good as well.   The salmon was ok but boring, the steak gristly.  I tasted the smoke flavor mentioned elsewhere also, but it couldn't make up for the mediocre cut of meat.   Neither was worth the $27.  We ordered asparagus on the side - five (!) sticks for $7, and there was nothing special to it.

Went there with a half off coupon, and that made it barely acceptable - the full tab for a meal for two (with no desert and only one side) at a quality of entrees I'd expect from Golden Corral would have been $120."}
{"text":"When your at a resort and you need to wait 15 to 20 minutes before the bartender or manager will even acknowledge you three nights in a row you have a service problem. The amount this place charges for drinks you would think they want to sell them. If your staying take a cab to a store, but what you like and bring it back to the resort. You will save time even if the cab gets a flat."}
{"text":"This is at the old Point at South Mountain. The restaurant is off the entrance to the hotel. They offer indoor and outdoor seating and it's off the golf course so nice outdoor views. The service was great. We requested to sit outside but it was a warm day and requested to be moved inside. They were very accommodating. Our server was attentive. I ordered the poke bowl and I was not disappointed ! Light, fresh and very tasty. The only reason for the 3 stars is that this place is WAY over priced. It's a typical tourist trap. They have a gift shop near the restaurant with more over priced item. I typically bring out of towners here since the view is so nice. Know in advance this is extremely high in price before you go."}
{"text":"We at Thanksgiving at the lobby grill this year.  The buffet was $60 and kids under 5 were free.  We thought they did a great job with traditional fare and unique sections (pumpkin ancho chili soup with a maple topping was my favorite)."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant.
It came as somewhat of a surprise, since the hotel room service food was of mediocre at best quality. 
Our server was super attentive and friendly. The sunset over the golf course was divine.
The atmosphere was very nice. Not too casual and not too ritzy. It was also very family oriented.

I REALLY recommend the brussel sprout salad. I looove salad and this is one of the best ones I've had in a while. Don't let the name scare you off.. I'm not always the biggest fan of the brussel sprouts (when I was 5 I barfed at the Christmas Dinner table when having them for the first time).. It doesnt have that bitter flavor at all, and the bacon bits and dressing.. mmmm"}
{"text":"Was just here recently with a very large group of friends. The atmosphere was decent, it was mid-week and empty. Good for us as we had a lot of kids. The wild mushroom pizza was really good. Several people vouched for that. My prime rib-eye was terrible. How can you mess up rib-eye?  All you need is salt and pepper.... it came out on a hot platter with a thin slice of herb butter on top of it still not melted. Even with the butter it was flavorless.... maybe they didn't really give PRIME.... it was not good at all. My friend got it too and felt the same way. The garlic mashed potatoes were pretty good though."}
{"text":"We had dessert there one night and it was just OK. Kids had the mini donuts, which were awful. You know it's bad when a kid won't eat a donut. The price was ridiculous for what we got. We decided to give it a second chance and have the breakfast buffet the next day. In a word: disappointing. the eggs, bacon and sausage were fairly good but the pastries at costco were better and the french toast was completely inedible - worst I have ever had in my life. Ever. Extremely overpriced and the service was slow and way below average. For a quality resort, you would think they would at least serve filtered water; nope, tap water. Which in Phoenix, is awful. Do yourself a favor, if you go to the Arizona Grand, just leave the resort to go eat. You'll save money, time, and frustration."}
{"text":"We were guests of the hotel and when we went to the restaurant (which looked half empty), we were told there was a one hour wait. But when we were seated the people in the line just behind us had almost finished their meal, despite they didn't have a reservation like us (we had talked to them when we first went to the restaurant)
We waited and when we went back it took 20 minutes to get a server pay attention to us. The good was not bad but it took another 10 minutes to get someone get me some tap water. Nobody ever come to ask if we were okay or we needed anything 
The surprise was that, despite I ordered a pizza which didn't have tomato on top, when I raised the last piece of my pie, there was a tomato residue on the plate, like the dish hadn't been properly cleaned. Terrible"}
{"text":"So we decided to try this place since there was only a few places open on Xmas day.  The service was amazing, our server was very charismatic, extremely helpful and was punctual with the drinks and food.  I've ordered the bloody Mary with Kettle one vodka (not up to part),  We started with the grill artichokes,  although it was our first time trying it, it really was not the best, or met our standards.  I ordered the NY strip medium rare with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and she ordered the Rotisserie Chicken.  The New York strip ($33) was a little bit undercooked, and it still had all the fat around it.  Clearly could had gone to texas roadhouse for a better steak and cheaper and for a bigger portion.  The mashed potatoes were not buttery or seasoned correctly and there was no gravy.  The Rotisserie Chicken was pretty good but again it only came with a side of teaser salad for starters.   To culminate this, $160 it is really not worth this place, don't get me wrong the view is extremely nice, and the service great but the food mhmm so not worth it."}
{"text":"My family stayed at the Grand yesterday and ate at The Lobby Grill today for lunch.  The prices are kind of high but considering its in the hotel that is expected.  That being said, I, my wife and out kids all really liked everything we ordered.  It seemed kind of like your run of the mill hotel restaurant so our bar was pretty low but we were pleasantly surprised.  The french dip was great, the brussel sprouts were delicious and the pizza cookie at the end was the best we have had living here in the valley, it rocked."}
{"text":"Raspberry Cream - not too sweet, lovely little cup on the side - oh the love I have, and yet the hate of my thighs - not that it matters on Vacation - but even if you don't have French Toast - ask for some for your pancakes or to add to one of the gooey goodness of cinnamon rolls on the buffett...

I am a carb loving chick - so when you bring me my own cute little loaf of toast and then 3 fresh made jams - I'm gonna follow you anywhere - and then have indoor/outdoor seating and a breakfast buffet on a weekday - honey, I think we are headed to the chapel!"}
{"text":"the fish and chips was some of the best i have ever had and the drinks were pretty good. i recomend this over the actual resturaunt."}
{"text":"Looks like they have a nice menu but every time we tried to eat lunch there, they only offered a buffet. Did it once and it was okay.  At breakfast, they ran out of toast and that was early in the morning."}
{"text":"We had a reservation at 10:30am Tuesday. We were seated immediately in front of the bay windows that looked out onto the grassy area. Very picturesque. 

This is a family friendly restaurant with a relaxed feel. 
Breakfast items range from pancakes, waffles, eggs to breakfast burritos. 

My daughter ordered orange juice, 3 egg omelet made with bacon, ham and cheese with a side of toast and hash browns. 
I had 2 eggs with bacon and hash browns and fresh fruit and an ice tea.

Daughter said her omlet had a funny taste to it. Could have been the bacon. I took a bite and it kind of had a griddle taste to it if that makes any sense.

The toast was way better than any toast I ever had. It was really a loaf of bread lightly toasted served with three jams; Apple Cinnamon, Strawberry, Blueberry. 
That was our favorite part of the breakfast.

My eggs and hashbrowns were typical, nothing special. The fresh fruit was descent. The bacon was cooked perfectly and not greasy. 

The bill came out to $45.76. I was able to use my $50 credit to pay for breakfast and only had to pay a little out of pocket for tipping."}
{"text":"09/02/10

I've dined a few times at Arizona Grand's restaurants, many of them now gone (Latitude 30 and The Phantom Horse Grill).  The Lobby Grill is a smaller version of TPHG- same furnishings, different location.  I'd have eaten here earlier if I could've found it-- just follow the signs until it seems you've gone too far, and you're almost there!  Don't worry about finding parking spaces-- it may look like a long walk, but it's really just around the corner, down the \"hill.\"  

There was a little confusion as it seemed that the main dining room was closed and seating was only at the bar, but the host was nice enough to let us sit at a booth; This was a relief, as it looked cold and dark inside the bar, and warm and bright inside the main room.  Service was a bit slow, despite the facts that there was only a family of three (one was a toddler) seated before us, and I'd already perused through the menu online-- I knew what I wanted to try!  (Oh, how I'd rejoice when the day comes where I can place my order online so that it would be ready to serve when I am seated!)

We ordered the Filet bleu cheese pizza and the Reinvented Waldorf salad.  This order took awhile (35-40 minutes!) to arrive, so it would be in your best interests to bring something to read if you're dining alone, or if the members of your group aren't into small talk.  Thankfully, there's a gift shop across the hall!  As far as resort gift shops go, this isn't shabby at all.  It even carries Brighton jewelry!  Be warned, their inventory doesn't carry the newer items you'll find at the mall.  But I'm not here to talk about silver watches...

I included the prices of our entrees and they were a bit high, but when my Mom is willing to overlook the higher costs to have another slice of that wonderful pizza, w/ such tender chunks of filet and pungent bleu cheese (we ate all but a small slice, which I took home and ate for dinner that evening!), or the terrific salad (the candied walnuts were addictive!), then I know I've found a winner of a dining venue!

We'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"We stayed here at the Arizona Grand for 4 days for a family wedding.  The menu was a bit limited, but I could always find something I liked.  First day, lunch, I had a C- chicken Caesar.  Very little dressing, which itself was lacking flavor and what seemed like the kind of \"pulled chicken\" that you'd find in an enchilada.  It was all breast meat, kind of dry and low on flavor.  Second day breakfast, a vegetable, egg white \"frittata\" actually more of a scramble.  I asked them to substitute cheddar for the goat cheese called out on the menu.  I have to confess, goat cheese is just too goaty for me.  Got a glass of OJ that was fresh squeezed and derlishous.  Third day, dinner.  They were having some sort of corporate event in the dining room, but served the whole menu in the bar.  I had the special of the night - grilled prawns over gorgonzola risotto.  It was wonderful!

I'm actually not much of risotto fan, but the blue cheese kick and creaminess, topped with a little arugula salad and then the perfectly textured, buttery prawns over that....  I loved it.  Last day we slept in and decided to hold off on eating until the obligatory early check out at 11 was completed.  Little did we know, the menu switched to lunch at just that hour, so we split a club sandwich as sort of a breakfast-y offering, maybe because of the bacon.

The total standout aspect of what would otherwise have been a C+ to B- value was the servers.  Our two favorites were Bob and Stephanie, although they were all exceptional.  Always there when needed them, and not when we didn't, totally accommodating, but most rare, completely genuine and unaffected.  Service rarely trumps food for me, but when it's this good..."}
{"text":"I rated them when I rated the hotel, but lets rate them again!  A couple of misses, the hits can be as hard as their misses, with a lot more on-point than a failed encounter with an-off day manager (who got in my husbands tired and jet lagged face waiting for an hour for our dinner...).

Jennifer is an incredible server, far more professional than her young demeanor shows.  And their Food and Beverage Manager is one of the most attentive and caring leaders I have had the pleasure to meet (oh how I felt I was in Charles Strong from Intercontinental Boston care!).  And while we wouldn't recommend the artichoke dish and the fried calamari were underseasoned...  Their pizzas were great, as was their rotisserie chicken...  THAT CHICKEN!!!!! Such a pheasant dish, and yet so perfect and delicious.  The breakfast buffet is pricey ($26 per person), but I loved their take on huevos rancheros - great flavor, presentation and perfectly executed.  Definitely will dine with them again, when we are back for the next conference!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot. I stayed at the resort and ate at the lobby grill (bar). The grill was the #1 rated spot by the staff onsite. I tried the ahi tuna salad which was fresh, flavorful And very well prepared ahi perfectly seared. 

The sweet potato fries were yummy and I think they were fried with rosemary, very creative. The bar tender Recomended the deep eddy their grapefruit martini, balanced and yummy not too sweet. I'd go back, the drivers suggested the power packed grilled cheese."}
{"text":"This grill is all about sitting outside to eat (when it's not hot), not necessarily the food. It's good but highly over priced. I stayed for a week and loved the wait staff except for Nicole. She had a 'tude but Brenda ... She's fantastic. When serving over priced food, not a good idea to act like you are too good for the people paying for it. And of course because of review sites like Yelp."}
{"text":"The view is beautiful, but the food is some of the worst I have had. The food is overpriced here. The  resort is great, but the quality of the food they serve is below average. The smallest piece of salmon on a 20 dls salad. Tons of lettuce, if you like lettuce come here lol."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before we went. The convenience factor won me over. The food was actually pretty good. However, it took a long time to get our meal. The server proactively took 10% off our bill. Nice view and very comfortable patio."}
{"text":"Great food, horrible service.  We were so shocked at how horrible the dinner went we asked for a manager- one never came.  Since we were staying at the resort they sent us a email inquiring about our experience and we told them about everything that happened at dinner- didn't hear anything back.  They don't care, and will continue to lose business because of it.

If you want to feel like your dining at a poorly run IHOP but pay resort priced foods- this is your place!!! Come and get it!!"}
{"text":"Embarrassingly bad. We sat down on a chair with guacamole on it and the table top was sticky. We had to clean off my spouse's dress with a wet rag and have someone clean the table before we could even look at the menus. This is good and a bad start. We ordered eggs Benedict which was ok, nothing special. My omelette, however was overcooked and had no flavor. This place has a nice view but that's about it. Overpriced food that no one would come back for. The Grand Resort should be ashamed to run this kind of restaurant."}
{"text":"Skip this place. Very expensive, very mediocre food when there are so many better options in the South Phoenix area. The view is pretty..."}
{"text":"Totally dissapointed.  I had purchased a coupon from TravelZoo, to try out this restaurant, which given its location I would have thought it was going to be very upscale and we were expecting a WHOLE LOT MORE.  
The Service was great, but the food, not worth it.  The restaurant itself is very outdated, very 80's.  
My husband and I had the crab cakes for appertizer.  They were cold when they were served.  We told our waiter, who in turn told the chef, and the message was passed back to us, that she appologized.   
My Husband ordred a 12oz New York Strip ala carte for $29.95, 6 oz of that was pure fat!  and for the price you would expect to get more meat than fat!  I ordered a wild mushroom pizza, which was OK.   This place needs an over haul in a major way, if they want to make any money at the restaurant, which for a Saturday night at 7pm when we went, was empty.  I think the highlight of the meal was the bottle of cabinet!"}
{"text":"This new restaurant is in the lobby of the Arizona Grand Resort and initially I wasn't sure what to expect from the name.

The atmosphere was great, with a beautiful view of the golf course's first tee.  Great patio for cooler weather.

My first trip I sampled the rib-eye.  I was blown away.  It had this wonderful smoky flavor to it that I hadn't had before.  Cooked to perfection and served with a bulb of roasted garlic. Yum.  One of the best steaks that I have ever had.

I went back for lunch with a friend a few weeks later.  We got these great little wonton chips and dip brought to our table that were quite tasty.  We both had the cream of mushroom soup to start that had a great texture and flavor.  Not too heavy on the cream.  Then we both ordered a pizza.  I got the filet with blue cheese and he got the BLT pizza.  

When the pizzas arrived I was surprised to see that they were HUGE.  We easily could have split one and still had leftovers.  Got to swap slices and both were excellent.

This would be a great place to take out of towners for a a beautiful dining experience or a great date.  I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I didn't stay here, but patronized their restaurant. The servers were very polite and accommodating. They frequently refilled our drinks and aimed to serve by making sure the fireplaces were working. It's a nice place to hang at if you have a reason to be here."}
{"text":"The negative reviews take me by surprise. I've eaten here multiple times and the food is great. I would say the service is slow, but not bad. I definitely look forward to eating here when I stay at the resort."}
{"text":"Beautiful view. Great foods. Awesome service. What more can I say?!! We had dinner here 3 nights in a row & love everything! They messed up on my drink, brought it to their attention, immediately went & made me a new better one!!"}
{"text":"OK/average food but the worst service (breakfast) I may have ever had! It was a Sunday morning at the resort, so they should have expected a lot of people. We arrived at 8am, so it was not yet full. We waited ten minutes to tell the hostess we had a party of 2. Then, she says she needs to have us wait for ten minutes because she just gave a new table to each of her servers and wanted to give them time to catch up. ...ok, we wanted to sit but that seems fair. 

We walked the Lobby for 5 minutes and come back to see she has seated EVERY party behind us... Most 3-5 people per party. What?!? So, we finally sit down and wait about 5 minutes for our server. Still, the restaurant is not full and most are eating at the buffet so her job should be super easy. We order off the menu and she brings a cup of coffee, waters and never-ever returns! Someone else brought our food. We waited 15+ AFTER we were done eating. NOBODY came... We had to leave; we were in a hurry. She was checking on other tables (literally right next to us) and just never came to us. I had to go into the kitchen to get her. Seriously, if tried being patient, tried to flag her down... Terrible terrible service, as this is not what you'd expect from a resort like this.

I was beyond frustrated because we'd been done eating for at least 15 minutes and throughout breakfast I was dying for a coffee refill - which I never got. I have no idea why she was so out of it or seemed so \"in the weeds.\" As a former waitress, I feel I'm allowed to make the judgement that she was a terrible server. Net, the food was good, but the staff from the hostess to the waitress were bizarrely terrible!

So... Do NOT go here. Get your car from valet, drive to eat elsewhere, and you'll still be back before you would be if you are here. Plus... It was overpriced. I rate it a half-star, but Yelp only gives solid stars so I'll do them a solid and round up."}
{"text":"Ordered $18 Kale salad with no kale. Salad had moldy lettuce and a hair. I asked to substitute bacon with avocado and they charged me. Waitress had less than 20 words tops. I don't review ever but this was pretty bad."}
