{"text":"My wife had breakfast here with some friends and told me that we must come again - the whole family.  Wow I am so impressed!  Kind people, nice modern hip design, clean and great atmosphere.  The Coffee latte was probably the best i have had in a long time.  We ordered salads, Shakshuka omelettes and many others.  All I can say here is - absolutely delicious !  All he ingredients are high quality and fresh. You can tell that the food is made with a lot of thought and love.  In addition, you can buy these really good artisan breads to take home with you.  I am suspecting that this will easily become my favourite place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"Visited this new cafe with my family on Sunday. My biggest criticism of this place is that it's okay at everything, and not particularly very good at anything. Why: - need a more efficient way of taking orders. There is no table service. Orders are placed at the counter. Problem was, there was only one menu. The guy at the counter got overwhelmed and mad a few mistakes. Line up was also long. Self ordering via tablet at tables would fix this problem.  - good size place with presentable decor, but poor sound absorption (very noisy inside).  - food varied. Breads/bakery was very good. Omelette was simply dry and tasteless. Poached eggs okay. No little potatoes or breakfast meats (menu is on the limited size).   - prices average about $10/person plus beverage.   Would I return? Not by choice, maybe if someone else asks to go. It's not terrible, just better options nearby.    This place is similar to Aroma, but Aroma do it a little better.   For my money, on the weekend, I would rather go somewhere with table service."}
