{"text":"I was told about the side door I went there last Saturday and I was treated so awful they told me if I wanted Mexican food for me to go next door to the pigs but if I wasn't Mexican and if I prefer Italian food for me to go to Uncle Sam there was this one lady took me out of the store and walk me to the back of the store to show me where I could go that will be the last time I will ever go to your restaurant and I'll make sure to let all my friends know how awful they treated me"}
{"text":"I was soooooooo impressed by this place! I got the chicken pesto sandwich and the meatballs! Both of them were amazing I can't wait to come back and try everything else! And the service was great. Will be back- often!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed pastrami sliders and new seasonal pumpkin beer. Ambiance is nice, either at the bar or sitting down at a table. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Really great service. The waitress Jenna is the kinda girl that remembers your name and order. Shares a kitchen with Uncle Sal's so you know the food is to die for. Order the Cadillac with a $2 bottle of Red Sessions. I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat.  It's a joint-- an unpretentious, understated, intimate, and cozy bar/restaurant with warm wooden walls that remind me of somewhere in England or Europe--great vibe here,  It's the type of place a woman can go to alone, sit at the bar, chat with the waitresses and other customers, have a good home cooked-type of meal, and a drink without feeling awkward.  Clientele includes couples, groups of men, groups of women, everyone, both young and old.  It can get very busy here on Thursday nights when it has a live,free band.    The food is very good and reasonable, perfect for this foodie bargain hunter.  My favorite offering is the short rib dumplings with mushrooms, in a veal cream sauce.  It's  delicious and probably one of the best 'bar food' entrees in  Scottsdale.  The sandwiches are also very good, including the \"Starters\" pastrami sliders, two generous sliders with mustard for $5.  I generally get these with a cup of soup or a salad.    Speaking of soups, they are all delicious and are served with bread and butter, if you ask.  The other day I had broccoli soup, but my favorite is the spinach soup.  There are also burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, sausage sandwiches, pizza, appetizers--quite a lot for a small place, but they are able to pull this off because it shares a kitchen with Sal's, a formal Italian restaurant.  Specials are available daily too.  Patronize this place for its simple, well executed food, or stop by for a quick drink and chat.  Whatever the case, you won't be disappointed and you'll feel like you've found your new home away from home.."}
{"text":"Nice food, quick service...had gotten lunch there a few times which was solid, then we were \"forced\" to go to dinner when Uncle Sals was a long wait and we were starving....and we all were very happy."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service. I've been looking for decent quality take out and that's why I tried The Side Door. I ordered an hour before I got my food, and I was told 20-25 minutes till ready and had to ask three times, is our food almost ready, which was a salad and sandwich. The bartender responded with \"sorry, sometimes it gets backed up.\" Once we finally got our food, there were no napkins or silverware put into our bag. There were no apologies and nothing to try and get my business back. The food presentation was poor and the bar tender didn't know too much about the beer selection. I ordered a sanwhich which didn't come with a side, but the bartendsr didnt even offer a side or salad to go with the sandwich, which was possible to order. Overall I was not happy and wouldn't recommend to others."}
{"text":"What is worse, the horrible service or the interminable wait for mediocre, cold food?  45 minutes for an appetizer that was prepared from frozen and an hour wait for a salad were unacceptable.  Couple that with the surly attitude from the waitress and the fact that our entree was served cold and it was a waste of an evening.  Not worth a first visit, let alone a return one."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is great! Very friendly and local feel to it. I tried a few things here:  - Zucchini & onion rings: pretty good, but nothing special - Garbage salad: very tasty and fresh! - Pizza: Great crust and toppings - Rootbeer float: Yummy!  The best thing about this place is the price. So cheap!  The server was very friendly and attentive. However, when we asked for separate checks, she seemed upset. I would tell her to lighten up!"}
{"text":"I don't know what I like more ....the food or the staff!  I treated my daughter from Jersey to lunch at the Side Door. We split the Garbage salad. It was great. I always enjoy talking to the waitress Jen or Ashley. There are lots  of  regulars at the bar! Rick"}
{"text":"When I lived by this place I was a regular. Great food. Hard not to like what they make, they usually do it just right. The calzone I would get here is better than anywhere else I have tried one. Reasonable pricing, worth what you get."}
{"text":"Usually everything is fine so i didnt score bad but dont order the brats...its tasteless...probably cause it was boiled and not grilled. The waitress staff was excellent. I order here before and most of their food is excellent."}
{"text":"Best Stromboli I've had outside of NY or Chi-town. There is a place in Flagstaff that's pretty close.  I kid you not, the bread was fresh, the cheese was thick and the meat inside had so much flavor. I only ate half of it.  Now, they have a good selection of beer and wine and the atmosphere seemed friendly for a night with a friend or with your family. It's small and quaint.  I ordered take out and we had to wait about 15 minutes after driving 20 minutes to get our food, but thats the only knock I have. Our server was very nice (good looking too).  I'd go back for something else on the menu and a beer. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really am a big fan of this place. I've been here about four or five times over the last year and am always happy with it. Granted I always order the quesadilla and a glass of red - but it always hits the spot.  I love that it's a quaint little place and the bartender - I think her name is Jenna - is always super sweet. She always pours a big glass of wine too. I can't always finish it!  As most have said - it's a great neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food! I always get the dumplings, they're to die for. And they have great drinks. Love the atmosphere. Love this place! Great service"}
{"text":"Awesome. Great food. I think they serve the best Philly cheesesteak in town. The Chicago dog is as close as you'll get to the real deal. Where else can ya get the best Philly cheesesteak in town, a good ice cold beer and a scoop of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream ? The rest of the menu is solid as well. Great beer list, both draft and bottle and the wine list is beyond adequate. No booze so if you're looking for the best Philly cheesesteak in town, a scoop of chocolate chip cookie dough and a bloody mary, you're just shit outta luck.  The price is right and the service is spectacular. I can't say enough about this place !"}
{"text":"Have you ever heard of the \"Side Door Pour\"?  Very generous with the vino. And the sliders for $1.99 are a meal with the crack sauce. Love this place. Uncle Sals shares the same kitchen and when you ask the one waitress that has been there forever at Uncle Sals if she will do the \"side door pour\" she turns into a B!!!  Geez lady retire!  Lighten up!  Love u \"Side Door\"."}
{"text":"I just wish this place had a better staff! The food and prices are not bad but the waiters make it unbearable. They are extremely rude and ignore you. The skinny girl has the worst attitude of all and literally puts her hand on the side of her face to ignore customers. I have been here three times hoping it would improve but I'm done."}
{"text":"Since this is conveniently close to my house I wanted to give it a try. I arrived to pick up my to go order and it was not ready upon my arrival. The food was alright. The grilled wings were the best out of everything I ordered. I also had the  chicken sandwich but there was hardly any chicken. The sweet potatoe fries were mushy. For convience the place is good but I don't think I will be returning for take out at this point."}
{"text":"I love this place! awesome food, great beer/wine selection. A really relaxed atmosphere. Thursdays they have .75 ice scream scoops, and they're kid friendly. Generous pour when you order a glass of wine, always a good thing in my book!  Jenna and Brooklyn are the only two that have served us and both and fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"I normally don't go out of my way to write reviews unless they are positive.  Let me begin by saying the wine pour my wife had was generous and the beer I had was good.  On the other hand, we decided to try the pizza and it was the worst excuse for a pie I have seen in years.  They should be embarrassed to send something like that out of the kitchen.  Either management is apathetic or the kitchen staff is ignorant to what a good pizza looks and tastes like.  Very substandard.  Also the bar staff were spending more time eating their dinner, at the back bar, than attending to patrons.  Very tacky.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  We've only ever done takeout and I think we've only been there on weekends but from what we've seen it seems like there needs to be a manager there at all times. Perhaps it's the weekend rush, but idk. Staff yelling at each other and making a scene in front of all the customers. But --- great pizza!"}
{"text":"Great take away (or eat there) food.   My husband and I are staying next door, and have gotten into the habit of grabbing a Stromboli, calzone or sandwich there for a delicious, reasonable lunch to take to the pool. I'm a vegetarian, and both the veggie stromboli and the Mediterranean calzone with tomato dipping sauce were delicious! For meat lovers, there are even more copious delicious selections.   Drinks are very reasonable, too, so it would be a great after-biking or after-golf spot to relax and grab a cold one!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name! This isn't a store, it's a popular and friendly local bar and restaurant. It shares a kitchen with Uncle Sal's and the same generous pours; the menu is different and more limited but with some great options. Seating is also limited but the prices can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Service is sooooo slow! It took 30 minutes to get a sandwich and a hotdog. I should have listened to the previous reviews and the man in front of me asking where is his food was for the third time. The food was just okay. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Great find.  Cozy, good food.  Started with the grilled spicy shrimp and chicken wing appetizers and waitress recommended Vodka sauce pizza with shrimp.  Very good. Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Do NOT be fooled by the mediocre exterior of The Side Door.  The sign outside is indicating they have \"Great hot dogs.\"  Now me.....not a fan of hot dogs, BUT the food that is served at The Side Door goes much further than just hot dogs.  The simple yet well made entree's could make you second guess on what you ordered, but regardless of what you order.....you won't be disappointed.  I had the Chicken Pesto pizza.  I wanna get it again....but there are too many things on the menu to just stay on one entree the next time I come back.  Not to mention the LARGE selection of wine and non overpriced beers that they have on the menu.  Try the Sonora White Chocolate beer.  HOLY HELL its good!!  Not too sweet, good on the alcohol (4.7%) and it comes in a LARGE bottle.  The quiet, low lite (sexy) ambiance and quite affordable menu of \"The Side Door\" will make you want to come back with anyone that is willing to go with you.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 stars...is that there were a lot of old people in there.  I like old people....just not when they are just sitting and staring at each other.  When you do go  to The Side Door Corner Store ...make sure you ask your waiter why its called \"The Side Door\" ;-)"}
{"text":"Good and inexpensive. If you live close by it will quickly become your go to early week favorite."}
{"text":"We went and had dinner last night. This place is typically a favorite place of ours, but last night our dinner was MEH at best. There was one lady working the entire place, and it got fairly crowded. She was friendly and helpful, but I suspect a bit overwhelmed when it got busy.  Typically, the pesto pizza is a favorite of ours. Last night, when our dinner came out, our pizza was stone cold, not even a HINT of warmth. The other couple with us also had a stone cold pizza too.  After waiting so long for the food, we didn't want to send the pizza's back, so the other couple told our server that it was stone cold. Her response was a bit odd, in that she said that she serves them but doesn't eat them. In any case, she did comp two glasses of wine. We expect that the pizzas must have sat there waiting to be served more than 20 minutes (or maybe even longer), as they were seriously stone-cold. The one person who ordered a hot dog was the last person to get their food, and they got it a good 10 minutes after everyone else was served. I suspect that we won't get the other couple to meet us there again..."}
{"text":"Found this spot via Yelp and really enjoyed it overall.  The food and drinks were very good, the portions generous and the prices fair. I like how it's a very unassuming place with a \"speak-easy' kind of vibe to it.  You can certainly tell it has it's regulars which adds character to the place.  The service was ok.  The young girl tending the bar / taking orders seemed more interested in talking to her drunk friends at the bar.  I'd like to go back one evening for drinks and to hang out a bit."}
{"text":"This place will be your new go-to neighborhood spot. Their grilled wings are absolutely to die for; perfectly crisp outside, juicy and tender chicken.   A whole carafe of wine is $10 so you can enjoy a low key night for pretty cheap. Try their braised spare rib ravioli... Holy heaven."}
{"text":"This is a great little corner bar, all the food is good and the service was great. Can get a little busy but good food is worth a wait."}
{"text":"Went here for Dinner with four other friends, servings are large, I thought the prices were pretty cheap!  Pastrami sliders, Stromboli, Calzone, were all good.   Nice beer selection, our food came out pretty quick.  Great marinara sauce. Good neighborhood vibe going on.."}
{"text":"We used to be huge fans of this place and even have given gift certificates to friends to try it out. We hadn't been in for awhile and I'm left appalled at how drastically things have gone down hill. It really saddens me as we all loved this place. My kids wanted to sit at a bar height table by the door, which is a new edition since our last visit. The chairs were frighteningly wobbly and not of the same quality as that of the previously existing furniture. I specifically chose this restaurant because in the past they had the quality I prefer and they had been great about special requests. For days, I had been dying for a good meatball sandwich but didn't have time to make one nor find a decent place to order one. However, I knew the Side Door had great meatballs and also serves sandwiches, like the Philly Cheese Steak. I thought, hey, maybe I can get them to slap some meatballs on the Philly Cheese Steak bread. When I asked, the waitress said she'd ask but warned the kitchen isn't usually accommodating to such requests. Sure enough, they denied it. Which is fair enough as it isn't a menu item. While disappointing, I understand to some degree but it's really not that difficult of a request. As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry, I try to avoid making requests that are really going to put anyone out. Had they agreed, I'd have been immensely grateful as I haven't had one in years! At any rate, it's not a menu item so I wouldn't ding them for that but sure would have given bonus points had they agreed. But the rest of the experience only added to my frustration. Our food came out and our server didn't come back to check on us. Ever. Half way through my dry cheese steak sandwich I was completely out of my beverage. After waiting and waiting for her to come by to check on us, I just gave up and choked down the other half of my sandwich and never received a refill during our meal. The burgers/sandwiches don't come with a side which has never concerned me. We have always ordered a plate of onion rings ($5) to share but the portion wasn't as generous this time. For $5, we were served 5 onion rings...that's $1/onion ring. Seems a little steep. My kids liked their burgers, as always. The root beer is amazing and on draft. But I paid $6.50 for the two root beers for my kids and never even got our drinks refilled. Had we received ample refills, that would have been okay. So for a cheese steak sandwich, 2 burgers, 1 order of onion rings to split, 2 root beers and a tea it was $41. It the quality/service backed up the cost, I'd be okay with it but it wasn't. Not even close. So by the time the check comes, I'm just extremely frustrated. Then to add insult to injury I found my debit card wasn't run for the correct amount. Any one of these things, I would have just overlooked it and remembered we all have off days. However, the combination of them doesn't allow for nearly as much understanding on my part."}
{"text":"The restaurant: Two thumbs up! Absolutely love this place! The Cadillac sandwich is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Cozy little bar/restaurant. Maria took my order and was super friendly. I got the hot Italian beef sandwich to go and it was delish!  Definitely coming back to dine in the future, very welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Amazing food, great beer selection, and awesome prices.  Definitely my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"5 stars for food 3 stars for service 1 star for time estimation  I love their food, the menu top to bottom is fantastic, especially anything with their pizza dough (pizza, calzone, etc.) They aren't very good at predicting how long the food will take for a take-out order, it's consistently underestimated"}
{"text":"So. . . I think the name is very misleading. I have thought about stopping in before, but I also thought this place was a deli counter with the usual sandwiches and a little ice cream. I would have been surprised.  My sister talked me into trying it out for a quick bite before our Thursday night class.  This place is like a neighborhood pub should be.  The wood bar is warm and inviting. The Side Door is small - very small.  Even though this is obviously a neighborhood joint, we didn't feel uncomfortable grabbing a table. For every 70-something that was at a table, there was  a 20-something at the bar.  The food was not amazing but it was decent and reasonably priced.  We split a Greek salad and a roasted veggie pizza.  The veggies were great, the crust, nothing to write home about, but could repeat.  I want to come back and try some of the sandwiches.  Somehow I have a feeling the Italian beef would be a hit. . ."}
{"text":"This is my ideal neighborhood bar!  It's the perfect spot to sit, hang out with a couple of good people, and enjoy a glass of wine or a nice beer. The beer/wine selections are quite good, with some obscure stuff.  My bartender (Jenna) was awesome, and very friendly. It's such a chill place, that when the bartenders get off their shift, they will sit at the bar and have a beer.   Most places I go, the staff has the desire to GTFO (and I can understand that), but this place is different.  It's small, perfect and locals only. No pretentious Scottsdale types. No one is concerned about their appearances, or their fashion. People are comfortable in their own skin, and \"it is what it is.\"   Bring a date here. She'll either be turned off that a bar is next door to a UPS Store, or flattered that you care enough to take her to a nice place, where you can sip wine or a nice beer while having a meaningful conversation."}
{"text":"portobello mushroom sandwich!  Yummmmmmm.  Service can be a bit on the slow side but the food is always worth the wait.  Fill the down time with drinks and conversation :0)"}
{"text":"This was highly recommended by an acquaintance who spoke in lofty terms about the \"best Hamburger\" in town.  Ok, so we were open to the idea.  We enjoy Uncle Sal's from time to time so figured it would be good. WRONG- This place should come with a warning.  Food to be taken at your own risk.  The burger tasted like it  was a frozen patty that was cooked a to dry, tasteless glob. A waste of money and time.  First and last.  The first and last time we try the Side Door.  Also the first and last time we try a recommendation by that acquaintance."}
{"text":"Stopped here after signing some loan docs at AZ Fed, but I should have been here many times before since I literally live 2 blocks away. I saddled up to the bar for afternoon lunch and maybe a beer. I decided it's 2 in the afternoon and one beer might lead to another so I skipped the beer and just got food.   I ordered the fish sandwich with potato salad from the server behind the bar. While waiting, he kept me company and joked around a little bit so I felt pretty welcomed as a solo diner but it was a little overpowering while eating. This place is definitely a regulars kind of place, it seemed everyone in there knew each other but I didn't feel out of place. Alright, foods up.  It was pretty big piece of fish, definitely worth $7. I couldn't weigh it because it didn't come with the scales!!! It was super fresh and moist and tasted excellent and the potato salad was also really good. Was it the most amazing fish sandwich I've ever had? No, I can't even name the most amazing fish sandwich I've had so it probably doesn't exist yet."}
{"text":"Tradition dictates that nothing is as good as the first time you visit a place. This time, it took them 30 minutes to make a pretty inferior stromboli and it was the wrong ingredients. The veggie was way different last time and it looked like they put the Mediterrian version in my meal. Nobody puts feta and artichoke hearts and spinach in a veggie version, so it appears that they screwed up. This was a take-out order, so I had no choice on a return. Oh well, at least they have several attractive females working there that helped pass the time waiting for my wrong meal. Still only 7 bucks"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of the Side Door! My favorites on the menu include any of the calzones (They are massive!) the Santa Fe chicken pizza, and the California Chicken Salad. The pastrami slides are a steal at 1.95 but are a little dry! And the nights with live music are such a treat! Overall good atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is so cozy, nestled next to the Greenbelt, and close to my house! The food is amazing, the service is friendly and it's a great place to meet for a date, or happy hour to catch up with friends. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Well, love the location because it is practically next door, and it is one of those little bars/pubs that feels like home upon walking in the door.  Like Rhonda J., we were lured by the advertisement of a large beer and wine selection.  Like Rhonda J., we were not impressed with the varieties, all of which can be found at your local grocery store.  The exception was that they served La Rossa Italian beer, a favorite of my date.  What caught my eye was that the ice cream cooler was behind the bar!  What we liked about the menu was its prices: most sandwiches are $5.95 and $6.95.  Everything (e.g., fries) is sold separately.  Beer was a fair $3.50 each.  There was no one but us and the bartender/server/waitress at the time we stopped for lunch at 3PM in the afternoon.  She was very personable, but I think we want to try it again when there are more people there.  We'll definitely be back to try it again!"}
{"text":"Visited this place a few moths ago to try there pizza. I guess they are connected with Uncle Sals kitchen. Ordered 16 inch pizza with black olives and mushrooms. They gave me a 14 inch pie no olives and 5 slices of mushrooms. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!!!! AND IT TASED LIKE CRAP."}
{"text":"I have never actually eaten inside the Side Door -- we are strictly take-out customers here, and we are very satisfied ones. Their burgers are absolutely giant and really, really good. I've also had and loved the Italian beef sandwhich (french dip) and their Mediterranean chicken sandwich is awesome. My only complaint is the fries usually don't travel well and I've never been all that wowed by the pizza. But this place rocks as a great, inexpensive take-out option."}
{"text":"This is literally one of my favorite casual places to dine! I've been here so many times and every single time, I have great service and DELICIOUS food!! Their beer selection is fantastic and if you're a wino like me, they do not skimp on their pours here! ;) They do have beer and wine only so if you're craving a cocktail, this isn't your spot!   A few of my favorites:  *Spicy Grilled Shrimp Appetizer *Mac & Cheese  *California Chicken Salad - I mix their Cucumber Yogurt Dressing {Seriously, SO GOOD!! It is much better than ranch!} & Italian dressing  *Meatballs *Chicago Style Dog  *Mediterranean Chicken Sandwich  Seriously, everything is SO good. A lot of people come here for their pizza!   We'll see you again soon, Side Door fam!"}
{"text":"It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.... Loving Side Door!  We had tried it once for takeout and were not overwhelmed by it, but since it's a hop, skip and a jump away from our place, we decided to try it again and dine -in! The menu is not published online, so if you're wondering... it basically serves sandwiches, salads and pizza, all made fresh.  We both ordered pizza.  My bf was particularly excited that they had Peroni on tap!  You need to check out the picture of the portion of wine they served... reminded me of my grandpa, always filling the glass to the top! The pizza was very good, I had the 5 cheese and you could actually taste the gouda and fontina, it was greasy, fattening and fantastic! Bf had the El Pollo pizza with artichokes, mushroom, sundried tomato, chicken, and olives with a balsamic drizzle.  He loved it.  There was a small band playing that night and the place was pretty busy. There was one girl serving the entire place and she was a rockstar, never missed a beat!  We are looking forward to our next visit.  I think we found our new neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"I frequent all three restaurants owned by the same family in this local plaza this week I choose the Side Door for a margarita pizza which was cooked perfectly and had little added salt which the Dr. said I need to avoid, another win for this locally owned and run business.  Other suggestions are the calzones, shrimp appetizer, burger, soup of the day, hot dog, and a good selection of beer and wine."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch at this comfy, cozy bar and restaurant. Ordered a corned beef and Swiss sandwich and the bartender was thoughtful to ask if I'd like to make it a Reuben. The sandwich had plenty of meat in it, and the sweet potato fries I had with it were light and crispy. Excellent meal with attentive service. I am not a drinker but I did see the menu listed a wide variety of beer and wine.  Would have given 5 stars but the bread on the sandwich was a bit plain, but maybe that's because I ordered a Jewish sandwich in an Italian restaurant. Look forward to stopping by again to try something properly Italian."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets!!  Love the prices - they're actually reasonable!  The food is pretty good and high quality.  The beer and wine selection is awesome.  AND they don't feel the need to blast the music - you can actually appreciate the quiet chatter of  the room.  Live music some days.    LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"The most important thing to note is that this place shares a kitchen with the good Italian restaurant, Uncle Sals.  We happened to find this place when I was going to Office Max in the same complex.  We stepped in to check it out as the signs outside advertised a large selection of beer and wine to go.  While we were not overly impressed with the amount of beer and wine to go (about 20 varieties of imported 6 packs and about 20 wines), we were impressed with the menu.   I really like Uncle Sals so I knew the food would be good, and it was right up the alley of my picky fiance.  We went here for Valentines day as we figured it would not be too packed, we were right.  They offer some nice wines by the glass and imported beers at a very reasonable price.  The menu consists of burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs (Vienna Beef), pizza, calzones and some sides.  The dessert menu is limited to blue bunny ice cream.  There is a small bar at the rear and about 10 tables.  It is very small and has a nice vibe.  We both ordered personal pizzas and they were very good.  The service was attentive and the food came promptly, even though Uncle Sals next door was PACKED.  I have only been here once to eat, but the first impression was very good.  I wish they would add a couple of salads to the menu as in the summer that is often all I am in the mood for.  I think they need to tweak the menu a bit and I'd like to try it again before I really commit, but for now it is four stars.  I plan on going back soon, even just to have some Peroni on tap!"}
{"text":"We have been here for a week and dined at many places downtown. This is probably one of the most comfortable meals we have had. Good food, good noise level, and great service. A really nice local spot that I would visit again away from the downtown crowd."}
{"text":"Tasty food and drinks at cheap prices. This is our go to spot when we don't feel like making dinner. I really like the baked wings and the calzone. They also make a very tasty blue cheese and bacon burger. Very generous pours on the wine. Most of the locals eat there as well. I would also recommend their pizza"}
{"text":"Excellent  chicken salad!  Would definitely recommend it.  Great service,  very clean and cozy.  Husband had Mediterranean sandwich and he loved it. Hopefully will be back soon."}
{"text":"This little hideaway is a true gem. Classy atmosphere with an impressive menu.  Swing by for happy hour and stay for dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place especially for take out. Prices are reasonable and the food is outstanding. If you order wings get them grilled it really makes them good. Staff is very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a bar / grill where everybody knows your name this is it...  Great little joint with big savings on really great food. Side Door shares a kitchen with Uncle Sal's which is some of the best Italian food I've had in the valley. (Sal's - is a great date spot).  I recommend the sliders... $2.50 - are you kidding me? packed with fresh meat and they'll even let ya swap out ingredients if you ask - I prefer: Corned Beef, with Swiss, some grilled onions and topped off with Thousand Island dressing.  Their short ribbed dumplings are killer! & of course the pizzas are always great - also if you're from Chicago they've got you covered on the Chi-dogs!  The best part is there's live music a couple nights a month & they have a liquor license that lets them sell to go!!! That's right people - I head over sometimes just to grab a six pack - mix & match your own domestic & imports for only $8.50! Some of the beers they have are hard to find - my fav right now is Goose Island's Matilda Belgian Ale. SO GOOD!!!  The staff are friendly - I'm a little biased because my GF bartends their (Amber), but we've been going to the place long before she worked their :) The regulars are great fun and it's just an all around great joint to add to the list.   Don't miss out on this local treasure & remember to sit at the bar & strike up a conversation cause everyone wants to know your name! I'll probably be there :)"}
{"text":"One of our favorite neighborhood spots! Great service (generally--there's usually just one server, so you may wait on a busy night), great food, and great beer (and wine) selection. Their pizzas are just ok, as I've found some of the items to be on the menu. But, overall, Side Door is great."}
{"text":"The dumplings are to die for... So are the grilled spicy shrimp... And when nothing on the menu is more than $15.95, which is a large specialty pizza, you can't beat it. Oh! And their soup of the day is always homemade and always amazing!"}
{"text":"Good food, decent service, nice relaxed atmosphere.    I have been to this restaurant a few times for lunch.  The dumplings with veal gravy are one of the best things I have eaten.  The rest of the menu items are good but that dish is really great.    Service is Ok.  They cater to a little older crowd and service at times is very casual.  I have never had bad service, they are pretty attentive, just not extremely practiced.  There have been a few times where I have waited a while for my order to be taken or for my bill to arrive.    The atmosphere is golf casual.  The lunch crowd skews elderly but not old.  I think of it as working man mixed with early retirees.    Overall this restaurant gets 4 stars.  If service were a little more professional I think it would be a five star review.  And if I have the dumplings a few more times it might get five star anyway."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Awesome food and exceptional beer!! If you're a wings fan you will love how they prepare them. Lightly fried and then grilled, simply fantastic! If you're a craft beer enthusiast, you will love their wide variety of reasonable craft selections!  A fantastic local establishment that never let's you down. Great service, excellent food, exceptional beer and wine options(at reasonable prices) topped with a unique atmosphere! I'd recommend this place to anyone:-))!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a better than fast food lunch. Good service and cold beer in this quiet neighborhood spot.  Hard to go wrong with a brat."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food because the service was so exceptionally awful that we didn't dare stay to eat. After walking in for lunch, we stood near the door and went unacknowledged for close to five minutes - no greeting, not even eye contact from the server. After we stood there awkwardly for many minutes, the server walks by us and ignores us on her first pass, then walks by again and barks rudely \"you want to eat?\"  We replied in the affirmative. She snapped \"you just seat yourself here.\" And walked away.  No signage indicated this policy. We left feeling utterly astonished and grateful that her immediate rudeness and incompetence saved us from a likely terrible experience.   Avoid- unless you like senior citizen dens with awful service."}
{"text":"This place is owned by the same group that owns Uncle Sal's...they even share a kitchen, so I was expecting this to be just as good. But it wasn't much to my dismay.  I checked out their menu online, called in my order as I was leaving Continental Golf Course, which is across the street and grabbed my grub. Staff was friendly enough, food was ready on time and off I went.  I ordered a Philly cheese steak sub and a side of mac'n'cheese - both upon recommendation from the girl who answered the phone.  When I got home and ate I was seriously disappointed. The Philly was bland and the meat was tough...the mac'n'cheese was completely flavorless and seemed like it was old and reheated. Needless to say, I didn't finish my dinner.   I am a serious Uncle Sal's cheerleader and I wanted so much to be able to love this place as well... But it doesn't look like that will be the case. Strictly because of the connection to Uncle Sal's I will be giving this place a chance for redemption and I seriously hope it turns out better than the last time."}
{"text":"I have finally had my Side Door cherry popped! It's ridiculous how long I've lived so close to this place, and not had this great food.  When I think about the years I've gone without knowing that amazing marinara sauce, I get a little sad inside. But no more. I had the Mediterranean calzone, which had artichokes, kalamata olives and basil. I added fresh tomato to mine since I was getting it with no cheese.  This calzone is like a giant pizza dough pinata filled with toppings. It's huge! The marinara comes on the side and is a wonderfully garlicky sauce. Seriously good. I would've drank that little cup if I wasn't in a public place. Gotta give props for the dough as well. It's perfectly chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside.  That dough and that sauce are the things dreams (and maybe heaven) are made of.  The calzone was too much for one sitting, so I took half home and they gave me a side of sauce to go too. =)  I ate it for breakfast the next morning because the idea of waiting til lunch to eat it was unbearable."}
{"text":"I have eaten here at least 3 times and enjoyed my meal once.  Sandwich today was so ordinary, lacking flavor, and boring!  Corned Beef had no flavor, probably was nothing more than grocery store bought deli meat, on bread from the same day old shelf at the grocery store.  No draft soda to boot so I drank out of a plastic bottle?  This is something I would expect from the sandwich vendor in the slowest part of a flailing airport terminal.  Certainly does not meet my expectations of a quaint, neighborhood establishment.  There was a Circle K nearby, maybe that is where they got the sandwich!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times more than I've checked in on yelp.  I miss the wait staff I've grown to love.  Turn overs here seems a bit high, but the food and service still remains wonderful.  The best item on the menu is the grilled wings.  Best wings you'll ever try.  Since they're grilled, no messy fingers, just yum!"}
{"text":"This café is owned by the same folks who run Uncle Sal's (which is right around the corner, hence the name), and they share the same kitchen.  So, regarding food, feel free to look at my review for Uncle Sal's.  Nothing on the menu isn't great."}
{"text":"I love their pizza. The sauce is spot on. Family friends of ours, Italian immigrants, own a successful restaurant back in the Midwest where I'm from. This pizza brings me back there. Can't beat that sauce! Pizza gets 5 stars"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident, thought it was like a little store..... I love this place, the service is always excellent, the bartenders are awesome and make u feel so comfortable. The food is awesome, never have had a bad experience or poor food. I recommend it to peeps all the time."}
{"text":"Good food beer and great service! Meredith is a bad ass the best server/ bartender here."}
{"text":"Next time you are here make sure to ask for an extra fly in your drink.  Especially make sure that you ask for the extra special attitude when you let them know."}
{"text":"This place is a go-to dinner and pre-gaming joint. The food is ALL excellent, everything is priced absurdly low, including their great beer selection. It sucks that they are not open on Sunday..but yes, this place is great."}
{"text":"We had another swell time here....we usually dine @ Uncle Sal's ( right around the corner ), but when we want to snack, we hit The Side Door.....salads and sands always make for great eating, and on Thurs. nights , Trio Rio is a ton of fun ! I join the band for a pre-show discussion of music @ The Blind Pig ( Gossip & Hornito's ), then return to the Side Door for snacks w / friends and fine tunes. Between the 3 restaurants ( all within spit tin' distance of each other ), a fine time is had by all !"}
{"text":"Booze, balls and a budget. This place gets 5 stars for its large pour of noir and the fact that it's under $9. Meatballs are large and tasty. What a win. California chicken salad is bomb.com.  Thanks side door! We will be back."}
{"text":"I Love this place. The food isn't amazing, but can definitely recommend the California Chicken Salad. What makes the place great is the atmosphere and the super friendly service! Stop by the bar for a drink and you will surely strike up a nice conversation. I also recommend stopping by on a Thursday evening when they have live music!"}
{"text":"Nice place in my neighborhood. Have been there a couple of times before. Food is decent but today was a total disappointment. They advertised a Tuesday special - Chicago Hot Dog with an amazing picture on their FB page. Reality was far from the pic... You got a poppy seed bun with a hot dog and ketchup and mustard. Had to ask for onions and relish (which looked like some artificial colored green something) and I had to ask two times to get it. Posted a comment on their FB page incl. the realityHOt Dog pic so it will be interesting to see how they respond (if at all). Would have loved to post the pics within this review but seems I can't?"}
{"text":"This place was kind of strange. There was 1 waitress 1 bar tender. To sum up the service, I kind of felt like I had done something wrong because they kept slamming down our drinks and food. However, the place was packed and they were understandably  in a hurry so I guess it's understandable. We had the crab bisque that was on special. It was like Progresso canned potato soup plus imitation crab (not good). The quesadilla appetizer was really good. It's a flatbread with caramelized onions, steak, and this great cilanto dip. It was kind of greasy but still delicious. We were so so on the pizza. It was also greasy, as well as a bit bland and watery. It had a thin crust that tasted good but was lacking crispiness."}
{"text":"Lived around the corner from this place for over a year. Long overdue for a visit!  We went for lunch and sat at the bar. Had a rootbeer float which was A+++++ yum!   My friend had the Italian Bee and LOVED it. Said it reminded him of the little mom and pop shops in Chi-Town and Beantown.   I had the margherita pizza which had the softest and melt in your mouth slices of tomatoes EVAH!!!   A good choice for a good, simple meal :)"}
{"text":"Don't waste your $4 on the side salad. It's romaine, cheese, and I found the tiny tomato after I called and asked what was suppose to be in there.  Waste of money right there."}
{"text":"They say ask the locals and that what my daughter did. Guy overheard her talking to partner about where to go for lunch ,he recommend this place right up the street from where we were in the Scottsdale mall. Stated crab patties were heaven. Was heaven to get out of the heat! Waitress was right on it , pleasant, friendly , and recommendations . Had French onion soup to start was delish! Then had a cool mixed salad which was fresh, full of extras and wonderful. Daughter had soft fish tacos that were perfect . Small, quiet ,clean, many refills on tea."}
{"text":"Chicago dogs, meatballs, sausage sando, Mac and cheese, brownie....WOW!  Even picky kids loved the food.   Hours are a bit tight, but that must be the norm in AZ."}
{"text":"Only came here for drinks this past weekend after a bike ride but I would definitely give it another shot. Very small interior, with some chairs out front as well, but very \"homey\" inside, 2 small TV's, & LOTS of wall art/memorabilia. Prices for drinks aren't bad at all, beer was around $2-4 depending on what you got & wine was average $7-9 & they had a nice selection. The food that people were eating around us looked great so I would definitely come back for lunch or dinner sometime."}
{"text":"This is going to sound funny, but I really wanted a hotdog for dinner the other night.  My Yelper boyfriend surprised me with this joint, and I surely got my wish.  Conveniently located next door to us, we hopped over there to find a great spot.  We went on a Wednesday and happen to go on a night a band was playing.  I got the vienna hotdog with a side of the four-cheese mac, and I was living it up kindergarten style.  I enjoyed it with my ice cold Peroni and tapped my toe to the beat of the band.  I asked the manager, and they do music every week with a rotation of bands.  I'm looking forward to going back when I'm having a hotdog hankering and a live music itch."}
{"text":"Very nice quaint spot to enjoy a very nice beer selection, great , and some nice live music. Bring a friend, actually bring a few. You will be hooked."}
{"text":"Their prices are incredible. My boyfriend and I shared the chicken wings and Greek salad... both were delicious. I got a glass of wine as well and our total bill was about $20. The wings are grilled after they're tossed so they're less messy but the flavor has soaked in. So good.   This place was packed on a Friday night but we were able to get a table right away. If you go at peak hours you may expect to wait a little bit for a seat, and don't be in a hurry to get your food. They had one server for the whole place when I was there. But, I knew this going in and wasn't in a hurry, so it really didn't bug me that much.  I've heard they have live music here too. I'm new to the neighborhood so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We used to be regulars here and decided to check it out again. It looked the same on the inside, but the quality of our meals was poor and it took forever to get our meals. This would have been understandable but there was hardly anyone there. It was a very disappointing experience. There are lots of great pubs in Scottsdale, we see no need to return."}
{"text":"I have only ever got 1 thing from here because I immediately fell in love and it keeps me coming back and some days I am literally craving it... calzones. (Mediterranean to be exact). I've even tried others and different restaurants and none compare. The Mediterranean calzone holds a very very special place in my heart. And stomach."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and dinner...good service ....good food and best of all good value. Love the bar area ....dark and comfortable"}
{"text":"Disappointed tonight. Ordered a meatball sandwich and was later told they couldn't make the sandwich...what italian restaurant runs out of meatballs???. Oh well maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Good little spot. Gets busy sometimes but pizza is pretty great. Bartenders and staff have always been great."}
{"text":"Side Door, West on Hayde, a small location that does it right.   If you respect the Chicago area you will recognize Vienna beef right away.    I really enjoy the italian beef at this location, its hard to find a place that serves Italian Beef (see Defalcos Scottsdale Rd).  Bianca was our server and was very helpful for my first time, at the restaurant. If you live in the area check this place out for a quick bite to eat.    Where are all the other reviews?"}
{"text":"This was my last stop on the uncle sal's, blind pig, side door trifecta. This is probably my favorite! Ordered the fried zucchini (best I've had with a yummy poblano dipping sauce), the Stromboli and the pizza with vodka sauce and shrimp. It was all delish. We took home leftovers only because we wanted to save room for ice cream which was half price when we were there on Tuesday. This place might be less staffed than your regular restaurant, but the servers are nice, the food is good, and the prices are reasonable. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere here. I think the food is more like 3 stars, I got the pizza. But the wine and services was excellent. The servers were very nice and accommodating. I would go back to try another dish or even try their sister restaurant they share a kitchen with."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at the side door.  We've been long time customers and it's getting harder and harder to find a reason to like this place.  As mentioned so often,  the service is slow!  There really is no reason for this.  Prices have gone up and the food is not as good. Tried the pesto sandwich tonight at $8!!!! No flavor!  No side of course.  But the kicker is that it's not even a full chicken breast.  Really?  $8 for a partial chicken on a sandwich?  So disappointed in so many ways.  I need to remember to not come back.  Love their wings, but we'll just order them to go next time."}
{"text":"I have loved this place for a long time. I'm not sure why I keep going back because the service is terrible. They have stuck up waitresses that do not know how to deal w complaints. The main girl seems to think she is almost too good to serve anyone. Recently we were there and they were out of all the draft beers except 1 and the quality of food was not good. They are def cutting corners and they are very very slow w the food service. On average it takes us 45 mins to get our food. Tip to the owners, get more staff and speed up the kitchen. I'm def not going back for a while, if I ever do!!! Sorry Side Door staff, you know you have issues, someone has to call you out cause this problem has been consistent for a very long time."}
{"text":"My review of the Side Door is way overdue. This is my go-to neighborhood spot when I feel like a sandwich and a beer. Or just a sandwich. Or just a beer. The Side Door shares a kitchen with Uncle Sal's, so you know the food is going to be solid.  They have a great Mediterranean chicken sandwich, Stella, Peroni, 1554 and root beer on draft, and even have ice cream. Equally equipped for dinner or lunch, as their wine selection is fairly extensive too."}
{"text":"I would like the welcome this place as my new favorite hangout.  They have good wine and beer at unbeatable prices.  They also offer beer to go.  Normally restaurants that offer beer to go jack up the price, they do not.  Some beers are cheaper here than liquor stores.  The food is OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I think the most expensive item on the menu is $8.  They only have pizza and sandwiches.  Their french dip is the best I have ever had.  I ordered it with onions and peppers.  The dip was amazing.  I've also had the chicken sandwich twice and it's to die for.  This place is worth your time for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great spot in a great neighborhood.  Side Door has everything for everyone.  It is a tiny spot with a big menu.  I recommend getting there early for a table or seat at the bar.  After a long day, this is my go-to place for pizza.  When I'm craving carbs, I order their Blanco pizza....Yummy!    This place is always packed with regulars and has homey feel.  The drinks are reasonably priced.  They offer live music on certain nights.  I can't wait to stop in!"}
{"text":"Could not be a bigger fan of this little spot. Prices are great, food is fantastic, and the beer selection is pretty good too. Favorite thing: Check out the Pastrami & CHeddar Sliders on the appetizer menu. Practically their own entree and...wait for it....LESS than $2!  I go fairly often and ahve not been disappointed. You will not be either."}
{"text":"I am struggling to give this four stars.  Really solid 3+ and I'm feeling generous.   Had a Blue Burger.  It was good. They certainly didn't skimp on the meat, the blue or the fixins.  The hamburger was a bit dry however and I wasn't blown away by the service or the food.  I may go back, but I'm in no big hurry.  Not really noteworthy."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. For a couple of hours, I was the youngest person there. Not to mention the two 4 or 5 yr old girls with their parents. Then a couple of grandparents came in with their grand kids under their 30s. I believe the grand kids were visiting...for the Phoenix Open. The place was very cozy and very tight. Almost claustrophobic. The servers were very nice. Band was okay. I didn't recognize most of the songs. Maybe before my time. The food was okay. The menu is not as big as Sal's. If I were in my 50s, I would come back. I would recommend this place for people in their 50s and older."}
{"text":"This place is dope. Pastrami sliders are on point, and extremely cheap for how awesome they are. Nuff said."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for anything pesto so I thought I would try their Chicken Pesto Sandwich. It was excellent! The bread was warm and crusty, the lettuce and tomato tasted fresh and the pesto was basil-y and delicious.  The food did take longer than usual on this visit, but they are usually pretty quick. The service was stellar--one waitress for an almost full place and she still was able to refill my drink promptly without having to ask for it."}
{"text":"This is definitely a neighborhood bar/dine in spot. Everyone knows everyone here. It's a cozy place to grab a bite with friends. We've ordered the Greek Pizza and had hot dogs for the kiddos. Everything was great and extremely affordable. Since its a sister restaurant to one of my favorite Italian Spots (uncle sals) I'll definitely be back. Amazing customer service."}
{"text":"Pizza's were great, as were the appetizers, the med calzone not the top of the pops..... Let's suggest the pizza and the Stella on tap!"}
{"text":"Love the food at Side Door but (BUT) maaaannnn the service... its a 50/50 shot... it can be good or it can be BAD. Sometimes I feel the need to say, \"oh... pardon me for stopping in for food and drinks -- I thought this was a restaurant... didn't mean to intrude.\" :/  It's all good though, the Pizza Vesuvio makes up for it."}
{"text":"I expected more out of The Side Door.  I love Uncle Sals, so I had high expectations for this place. However, the service was lacking, and frankly a little rude. And the food wasn't flavorful in the least bit.   I came here with my boyfriend because he was constantly raving about picking up lunch from them. It was his first time dining in, and obviously my first visit, and neither of us were impressed. And it took twenty five minutes to get two sandwiches, that we had to scarf down so my boyfriend could get back to work.  I might try this place again, maybe."}
{"text":"I just love these 3 restaurants on the this corner owned by the Molinari family. They all have their own personality, staff and menu. Ive been here numerous times, tried numerous menu items but the other day, I was home and sick so ordered pickup. I got the homemade cauliflower soup...meh...not bad but nothing spectacular. I also got a white pizza which was delicious! Lots of cheese, including ricotta which is great on a pizza! Staff is always cool as well."}
{"text":"A tiny bar with a relaxing atmosphere that is perfect to stop into for a beer. But, that's about the only thing I am coming in for. I've been here 5-10 times and every time I have come for just a beer I have enjoyed myself. The dim lighting, enjoyable music, tasty beer, and good company has always been a good time.  But the times that I got food, I've always been disappointed. Twice my hotdog bun had hard cold spots like it was previously frozen and then the hotdog was burning hot. The burger had absolutely no flavor even after the waitress recommended it for being the most flavorful burger in Scottsdale. The service has also always been pretty slow."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place with great pizza (Smoked Salmon, Santa Fe are our favorites) and nice beer (1554 on tap). Overall, a fantastic, friendly vibe, have already been there about 10 times and never been let down with the experience."}
{"text":"My review is only based on a limited sampling of the menu, but based on my experience I have no doubt that the rest of their offerings are great.  The managed to serve a pretty darn good Philly Cheesesteak!  That alone earns them extra stars.  Everything on the menu is very reasonably priced.  The atmosphere is cozy, and as others have pointed out it definitely has the vibe of a locals bar (which in Old Town is not a bad thing!)"}
