{"text":"Resto italien classique.
Pâtes, pizzas, escalopes de veau, et entre-autres la côte de veau qui mérite de porter attention malgré que je l'ai trouvé un tantinet trop cuite à mon goût. (je suis du genre filet mignon bleu juste pour l'avoir chaud...)
Situé au 2e avec terrasse \"fermé\" chauffé, jolie décor bien étoffé, la familia est la très bienvenue. Service courtois et assez rapide.

Un bon resto italien de soir semaine à essayer avant le théâtre! :-)"}
{"text":"Good food and value -- dined upstairs twice. However, they seem to be little tired. For example, my soup bowl had an old, dirty crack -- don't see how they missed this except that maybe they don't care any more. Same goes for rusty salt shakers."}

After walking down the wrong end of St. Catherine's, we stumbled upon this place. We were hungry, cold and just wanted some shelter.

The restaurant is quaint and has two floors.

We were seated upstairs. The waiter introduced himself and asked if we prefer to speak French or English (thank goodness).  Their is a good selection on the menu and again, they have an English description below each item.  

For drinks, we ordered a pitcher of sangria. This was OK, it was on the sweeter side.

We started with the escargot with butter & garlic sauce - this was really good. The escargot just melted in my mouth and the butter & garlic sauce went great with the bread they served. We also got the arancini served with marinara sauce and this was OK. 

For entree, we split the carbonara and a spaghetti with shrimp. The homemade pasta for both dish were really good. The carbonara sauce was rich and delicious. The spaghetti with shrimp was also really good, except the shrimps were teeny teeny tiny; not even a quarter of an inch big!

The price was decent for our dishes, all under $20. But they do have seafood pasta dishes up to $50.

Also an interesting observation, the average diner's age for this restaurant was 50+..."}
