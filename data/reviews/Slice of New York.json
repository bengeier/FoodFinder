{"text":"Nice little halal pizza spot downtown. Hidden gem. Pizza is great. Burgers are not bad. Service is fast and friendly. One thing they could change is to have napkins instead of kleenex to wipe your hands...alot of variety..would def go back"}
{"text":"Cute little place--yummy food. Perfect for a shopping trip downtown."}
{"text":"This place is closed and has changed owners, now called Waynax. Similar menu though, hasn't yet been fully set up though. Hopefully quality is better."}
{"text":"A friend of mine frequents Slice of New York because it is Halal so the pepperoni is made from beef instead of pork. When I said I wanted to try it  to see what beef pepperoni tastes like, my friend told me he was in no way responsible if I did not enjoy my pizza.  Turns out he didn't need to make this disclaimer because their beef pepperoni was just as good as pork pepperoni and I did enjoy my pizza.  The crust was similar to Pizza Pizza crust and the sauce and cheese were both standard yumminess.

This place has been a fixture on Groupon Now for the last week or so ($6 for $10), so we ended up going with one other person and ordering an entire large pizza, which was a decent size - good enough to be split by 2 guys and 1 girl with no complaints.  A one topping pizza was $11.99+tax and we didn't have to wait too long for it, around 10 minutes while it was prepped and cooked in the pizza oven.

The tables and floor in this place are pretty cheap and worn, but clean enough and there are a bunch of four person tables, way more than a typical take-out pizza joint.  I would eat here again, and maybe try their shawarma, although aforementioned friend warned me against that too. =)"}
{"text":"Ate here and haven't had an upset stomach that had in months!  I should have known when I saw the huge vat of precooked Philly cheesesteak meat he pulled out from under the counter...  But I was there at the recommendation of a friend so I tried it out. 

Never again!"}
{"text":"Had my first ever chicken shawarma today and it was excellent! Bought a WagJag Express $5 for $10 worth and it was very big and filling, very fresh (I bought 2, one without any sauce for the hubby since he does not like chick peas/hummus). 

The restaurant itself isn't perfect, you can tell it's not a chain as it is far from being perfectly renovated and a few veggie toppings were missing like pickles and garlic spread but what was obviously the owner was very nice, worked quickly and did wear gloves while making my pitas. 

If this deal is still on in the future I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for quick lunch. 
Friday special is pick your own special and yet he tried to charge me full price for two shawarma.  
After I mentioned its a special he changed it to the correct price. (Buyer beware!) 
Sat in the restaurant to eat and noticed that the shawarmas were tightly wrapped and it wasn't over stuffed like other places. Chicken tastes ok. 
Probably won't here again."}
{"text":"Friendly place with a great Friday special. Walked in and got two big slices and two pops for $10. Definitely a good place to grab some food real quick for a good price."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. I live in the building next door and have tried them multiple times, and been disappointed each time. The first time I got a veggie pizza slice with vegetables that were so old and dry they looked like they had been kept for weeks in the fridge. The second time I got a slice of cheese pizza that looked and tasted good, but made me sick all night after. And the third time I ordered a falafel pita, came home, realized they'd given me a chicken shawarma pita, and when I went back to return it they told me they were all out of falafel so they couldn't replace it. At least I got my money back, but still - why couldn't you have just told me that when I ordered?

Terrible place, terrible attitude, and I'm not going there again."}
{"text":"Cozy place to eat.  Pizzas are fairly good, not greasy at all.  I would highly recommend their shawarmas and fries combo."}
{"text":"Went in one night at around 11pm whilst on a layover at the Greyhound station across the street, and they were all set to be closed. Floors mopped and everything, heck, I almost slipped because they were so wet. - Suggestion, maybe not mop up until after you've closed? 

They didn't have much left so I got the stromboli, which with a drink cost about $7. Total ripoff for what it was. Don't know if I'll be back again or not.

But really though, closing at 11pm, in downtown Toronto? How does this place even manage to stay open with such ridiculous hours? Toronto's supposed to be the city that never sleeps, at least according to the late great Marc Dailey, the voice of CityTV."}
{"text":"Dry, lacks taste, cold pizza. Pizza purchased from pizza hut, pizza pizza, a grocery store (anywhere really) is more worth and tastes better. Service was rude too, not returning."}
{"text":"Came here because I saw the shop name \"slice of New York\" so I was drawn to it since I thought New York had good pizzas? I don't know maybe I'm just use to eating Pizza Hut, pizza pizza pizzas... But this one was bland, dry and not flavourful at all.. 

After reading some reviews I noticed they are halal.. Maybe because I never really tasted halal pizza so I have a subjective POV..  But in general I thought their meat lover slice didn't taste very good with dried tomato sauce, hard cheese and bland tasting meat toppings... I had to sprinkle a lot of chilli flakes on to help me finish. 

Service was okay, the family that opened it seems nice. Their portion was really big for $4.75 .. Although probably because no one came to their shop.. I was full but will not come here again for a slice of pizza."}
{"text":"They have a coupon at a couple places but they are for 2-6 pm which doesn't work that well for most people. 

I was expecting just an average pizza joint but was pleasantly surprised to see much more in that food variety. They had subs, shawarmas, kababs, pizza, lasagna, pretty much everything italian or middle eastern. 

Good eats. Not exactly healthy but it is tastey!"}
{"text":"I was craving a chicken shawarma today so a friend and I went to this place for lunch.  They have a Shawarma special - buy one, get the second for $2 which turned out to be a good deal - less than $4 a person for a huge and very tasty Shawarma.  I really enjoyed it and I will be back.  The only disappointment for me was that they only serve Pepsi products and I am a Coke Zero fan."}
