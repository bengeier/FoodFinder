{"text":"Yummy & cheap.  You get lots for your dollar.  I run in for take-out now and then, or get delivery a couple miles away.  Sometimes i walk in with my youngest kid, 3 years old, and they got a little toy cart he can push around.  When he tries to head back into the kitchen, they chuckle at him.  I can attest to fine egg rolls, Mongolian Beef, yui-shan spicy pork, orange chicken (spicy!), moo shu pork.  Since we moved to Chandler 13 months ago, i have not bothered to try another go-to Chinese place.  Now I am frakking hungry"}
{"text":"When I first moved to AZ, a couple that I am friends with told me about red dragon and that it is very good.  I decided to check it out.  The first time that I went there, the food was great.  Not as good as the Chinese food from the east coast, where I am from, but it definately satisfied a chinese craving.  Since it was good the first time, I decided to go there on my lunch break.  I waited over 10 minutes at the counter because no one was in the kitchen.  I decided to order anyway and the food did not meet my expectations.  I went back for a third time thinking that they might of had an off day, but the third time everything was much worse.  When I walked in there was 5 people waiting and the cooks were sitting at a table eating.  They eventually got up to cook the orders that came in and the food was terrible.  I ordered general chicken with lomein and an egg roll.  The egg roll was extremely greasy, the chicken was chewy and gross and the lomein was under cooked.  Im not a fan anymore and I will be finding another place to eat chinese food."}
{"text":"Let me take a break from being thoroughly sick after our order. Not kidding. We decided to order for dinner today. Big mistake! After preparing a plate for my husband and two small kids, I get to sit down with my own plate and find bugs. Horrified, I take everyone's plates and dissect them, just to become more horrified and find more bugs. The breading in my children's sweet and sour chicken has BUGS BAKED INTO IT.  In the trash, all of it. $25 dollars of takeout. I should have known better when the restaurant was dirty. I should have known better when the woman I picked our food up from was rude and unpleasant. But it's greasy Chinese, and we've had a long week.. My husband makes a call. LOL so let's add insult to the probable gut wrenching injury my family is close to experiencing. I'm telling you, actual insults. To my husband.  Because we bought takeout from their place of business that was infested with bugs. Then being hung up on. Shame on us. Here's to going to bed on an empty stomach.. And being traumatized over chow mien for life."}
{"text":"Was in the Chandler area three weeks ago and decided to stop by this place to pick up some dinner on my way home.  I ordered the General Tso's Chicken ($9.95), Beef Chow Fun ($7.25), Eggplant in Garlic Sauce ($6.50), and Chicken Fried Rice ($6.50).    The food took forever to get ready, but boy, it was worth the wait since it was delicious!!!  For such reasonable prices, the portions were huge and the quality/taste of the dishes was a nice surprise.  My mom is picky when it comes to restaurant food, but she LOVED the chow fun.  The menu looks pretty extensive, with reasonable prices.  If you're looking for ambiance, this isn't the place.  However, for a casual dine-in experience or takeout, this place will hit the spot.    Their lunch menu items are nicely priced too...ranging from $4.50 to $5.75.  Looks like they're open 7 days a week, from 10:30am-10:30pm.    Too bad I now live in Tempe, otherwise I would stop by more often."}
{"text":"Food was ready quickly but I was disappointed. This is definitely a take out place only... dining room isn't set up very well for eating in. The sesame chicken tasted a lot like it had ketchup in the sauce, probably one of the worst I've had. Crab rangoon was tasty though."}
{"text":"This authentic Chinese food! Great food and reasonable prices.  Better than what you get at the Chinese cultural center in Tempe. Never ate a bad meal here."}
{"text":"The food was not good at all! We ordered online to have it delivered, and not only did it take an hour to get to us when it is around the corner, but it was cold and nasty.  Our Sweet and Sour Chicken was cold and stale, with no crunch to it at all. We had 2 random containers of rice. The Crab Rangoons were soft and stale just like the chicken. And our Vegetable Chow Mein was a bowl of soupy vegetables. I will never again order food from here and would not recommend it to anyone.  Dining in may be better than delivery, but I wouldn't count on it!"}
{"text":"After I ordered my food I watched them take a container of food that had been sitting and warm it up then put it back and give it to me the food was disgusting and tasted like it was sitting for a while never will eat here again"}
{"text":"This is my go to take out place! I've been ordering here for years now and have always been very happy with the food. Some of my go tos are the beef and broccoli, lo mien, sesame chicken, and egg drop soup.  I always try to get the lunch portions because it comes with rice,  entree, and then soup or soda for way too cheap and its a lot of food!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new.Chinese place that delivers. What I wasn't pleased with was the quality of the food. Good price. Fast delivery. Sweet and sour chicken was overcooked and crunchy... Yuck. Rice was under cooked and dry as hell. And their rangoons had barely anything in them. Way to rip off the hard working people who enjoy Chinese cuisine. Will never order from.here again. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for years and I LOVE their Orange chicken! Their portions are incredible and their prices are great. I can not say enough good things about this place but the main reason I finally added a review was that I couldn't believe that it wasn't 5 stars already. The only thing I would change if I could is I wish they filled their crab puffs a bit more but you get 8 in a serving so I really cant complain!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! The orange and lemon chicken and all their pork and scallop dishes are to die for. This is a great New York style chinese take out place. Most try considering all the other fantastic Asian options in the area."}
{"text":"I stopped calling after they screwed up my 3rd delivery order. When I called to complain the last time, the person on the phone was unapologetic. I only ever ordered delivery from them; perhaps dining room service food/service is better, but I am not going to bother to find out."}
{"text":"If you like to eat what a cockroach eats or like roaches in your food, get food from here. If you like extremely poor customer service and getting hung up on when you have a concern, this is the place for you! If you don't like refunds when you're unsatisfied with the bug to food ratio, by all means...enjoy! If you don't like all these things however, you're just not going to want to purchase food from here without a public health inspector and a translator as witnesses. Why would you NOT give a long time customer who has never complained before a refund for an entire order if they had clearly visible insects in their food which mostly in tact and obviously incorporated and cooked into the dish?!?! There's absolutely no point in offering a refund for only the items that had bugs in them if there's evidence in one's food that leads a customer to suspect that the ENTIRE kitchen is bug infested, rendering ALL OF THE FOOD inedible to that customer. Furthermore, the customer is always right...*especially* when it comes to the quality of food they ingest. It's really not a hard concept to grasp for most restaurant staff. The problem with this place is that it seems to not have a manager. That may be the cause for all of it's shortcomings. If there is a manager they've thoroughly trained their staff to be roach enabling con artists. I will never eat/purchase food from here again and probably will not have an appetite for Chinese food delivery for quite some time. Blech!~"}
{"text":"I got bloody beef and broccoli here once and never ordered from this place again. Disgusting."}
{"text":"This place is my go to, quick, Chinese take out. I order house combination C22. It's got everything you need and it's delightful!"}
{"text":"Wow, where do I start. I have had Red Dragon about Twenty  Times. There was a Chef there at one time about say 2 and a half maybe three years ago..food was Great. At that time I could over look alot of completely disgusting food handling practices I have witnessed, not every time but many times...and frankly one time is too many. I believe people's posts here that say they got sick. He is gone now and the food has suffered. I have noticed the sky motif lights in the small dining room has what appears to be cock roach bodies dead of course...but it had always prompted me to look up and watch for live bugs scampering across the fluorescent light covers while sitting there waiting for my food. I only had a live cock roach run across the floor in front of me one time in a couple years.  I guess thats why people reffer to it as \"authentic New York chinese food\" Multiple times the worker had a cold or was dripping sweat and would wipe his face with the back of his hand, handle my money  then fill my rice quart  container with the steamed rice behind the counter. I would usually just throw that away because the chefs food was worth it, but after he left the sight of that just grossed me out. One of the workers children would sleep in the cubby under neath the register, and one day popped out from under there and shocked the Rangoon right out of me.  And so did the food after the last time I went there about six months ago. The septic system had backed up completely full, and there is a 4 foot by 4 foot metal plate right there in the kitchen that they removed to reveal what that day was a four foot wide  several feet deep ses pool of sewage back up that they were pumping out with an electric sump pump right there as they were making people's food...one of the cooks was doing his best to pump the sewage out, but there was no way to take care of that without complete contamination of himself and that area. I can only hope he did not cook when he was done. I took my food and dropped it in the garbage can outside the restraunt and have never been able to go back. That sewage is right there in that kitchen under that metal plate and there is no way I can un see what was going down that day. Good luck with that."}
{"text":"I should have reviewed these guys years ago...so sorry for the delay. Again, you probably have to take into account that I'm a NYer living in AZ, so I generally seek out food that compares in taste and style to that which New Yorkers are accustomed to. We have phenomenal Chinese food in NY that grows from \"hole in the wall\" take out restaurants in cracks and crevices in the city. Red Dragon is such a place and I'm so happy that they're here. I only wish I didn't live a half hour away from them!  Despite the drive, they are worth the trip. They aren't fake Chinese food like Panda Express, so if that's what you know to compare them to, it may be a different experience for you.   The owners are from NY and they tout their place as \"NY Style Chinese Food\". They have and KNOW what duck sauce is! Hallelujah! I am always shocked that Chinese food places here don't use it nor know about it. Soy sauce is not the only Asian condiment people! Try duck sauce on your rice or dunk your egg rolls and spring rolls in it. DELISH! My husband loves the fried chicken wings (cooked in peanut oil). We adore the General Tso's chicken, their egg foo young is great and the rices are to die for! Great egg drop soup, chicken or beef and broccoli and too many other menu items to count! Anyone from NY will know just what I mean about the style and anyone from anywhere else- give it a try!  There's no fine dining, you won't want to eat in, as it's really not a sit down restaurant- no booths, cheesy tables and chairs, but I'm not use to eating at a Chinese food place unless it's a buffet anyway, and this is not. This is just amazing NY style Chinese take-out, definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The worst thing about this place is that it's so far from my house.  Definitely my favorite Chinese place in the valley so far.  Reasonably priced, friendly people, excellent food with which they are very generous.  The orange chicken here is very good and very.. orangey.  It's one of those hole in the wall places that you wander in to by chance.  Really small place with only three or four tables.  So good that at least three people I know started delivering for them just so they could score a free meal every now and then."}
{"text":"We've been here only once for a reason- when we arrived on an early Saturday evening, the two hostesses gave us a hard time for not having reservations. They reluctantly seated us (we would've just left but our kids \"earned\" a night out and this was their choice).  When we were seated we expected it to be packed but there was only one other family there.  Strange that they gave us so much grief for not having reservations. Also unimpressive was the teppanyaki experience.  The chef hurried through and did the old, usual \" tricks\" we've seen too many times.  We were in and out in 40 minutes.  I wish I had better things to say because the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"One day I received a menu that was left outside my apartment door so I took a chance and ordered delivery for the first time and was extremely pleased by the quality and the taste of the food so I continued to order on several different occasions until one night, I was told (in a very rude manner) that they would be changing the route soon and would no longer be delivering to my address. About a week later, I called instead of placing my order online to see if they were still delivering to my area and was pleased to hear that they would still be delivering to my address so I happily placed my order over the phone. When the delivery arrived, the same driver from the previous encounter rolled his eyes when he realized that it was me and was rude but I did not engage him. I ordered two more times after this incident over a two month span and my food was delivered by different people who were very courteous, I even offered one of them water because it was so hot out but he refused. It was the most recent experience that will keep me from EVER ordering from this place again. The same guy from previous negative experiences made the delivery this time and as he was swiping my card, he began sighing and rolling his eyes. As he tore the copy of my receipt he waved it in my face and told said \"I'm not gonna tell you again, we will not deliver here anymore!\" When I advised him that I had called on a previous occasion to confirm this and was told otherwise, he held up my receipt and boldly stated \"No one wants to come here for THIS!\" and handed me my receipt. I took the receipt, said thank you and closed my door. It's unfortunate that because of this one delivery person, I will no longer be ordering from here again..."}
{"text":"I just found this Chinese restaurant and I just loved their food. I come from Massachusetts and have been here for many years and thought I would never find Chinese food as good as there. I believe they advertise as a New York style dining and they really didn't disappoint. We got fried chicken wings, spareribs, pork fried rice, sweet & sour chicken plus a few other items and everything was fresh and tasted great. Best of all = they deliver!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurants in Arizona. Their potstickers and lo mein are excellent. They deliver to a large area and are very quick."}
{"text":"I love the food and the online ordering was really good. Then they signed up with beyond menu and there online ordering sucks. I miss the old sight and i call in now. I really used to like quickly ordering online. beyond menu is such trash it lets you fully complete your order, then  switch to their web sight without saving your order. bad bad bad. go back to your old sight,"}
{"text":"This part-Chinese Jersey girl is here to tell you that Red Dragon is definitely an authentic NY-style Chinese restaurant, down to the brusque way in which they take your order over the phone. LOL.  We tried the Kung Pao Chicken and the Orange Chicken combo platter, which is my go-to when testing out a new Chinese restaurant.  Our food was flavorful and delicious, but my only complaint was that the Kung Pao Chicken was 90% Kung Pao and 10% chicken.  Otherwise it was really good.  This is my new go-to Chinese restaurant in the east valley."}
{"text":"I have tried many different dishes from this place especially the seafood ones. Nothing I've tasted so far is bad except the pork fried rice was not what I expected. My favorite thing is probably the garlic shrimp and their egg drop soup is just how I like it. The service and people are very blah but if you take a menu with you each time it has a 10% off coupon for next time."}
{"text":"Price, portion sizes, and taste of the food overall are all really good.  I was a bit hesitant to try this place because they are a \"hole in the wall\" in an old less than great strip mall, BUT don't let that fool you! The food is definitely worth it.    My only suggestion is they could try to be a little more friendly. If they were more welcoming and seemed like they appreciated your business more, I'd have given 5 stars. Maybe it's a NY thing.."}
{"text":"I am new to Phoenix and was looking for a really good Chinese place.  This menu showed up on my door and I thought what the hell...well that's what I said after dealing with poor customer service and a dish called \"Dragon and Phoenix\".  This dish sounded good but had well over a whole onion and very little flavor.  The meat dumplings....mystery meat!  Definitely not potstickers.  The search continues, good luck on your visit to this place."}
{"text":"Yo yo. I'm a true New Yorker.  Raised in Brooklyn, Forest Hills, Queens and Westbury, L.I.  I've spent time in many states across the US and would rate this joint as the closest thing to getting real NY chinese food. Folks here in AZ (I've been here for 13+ years) know nothing about duck sauce and fried chicken wings.  They think I'm crazy when I mention them. This is a take-out spot.  The small tables there are for you to wait for your food after ordering by phone. Try this spot.  I promise it's great!"}
{"text":"Lets just say that they are the reason I don't eat Chinese food anymore.  There was a hair in my cum like sauce. barf. . .  I can't do it anymore."}
{"text":"Supper Yummy!!! The place doesn't look very nice when you first walk in but don't be scared.  They have a huge menu with tons of yummy items.  The staff was really nice and even gave us a few free drinks!  I can't wait to have their dry sauteed green beans again."}
{"text":"Honestly I have been a red dragon customer for over 4 years.  It has gone way downhill.  Their ingredients are very poor quality.    We ordered General Tso's beef, moo shu pork, vegitible lo mein and hot sour soup.  The general tso's and moo shu items we tried one bite of and threw them in the trash.  The pork and beef both we pure fat..  The moo shu tasted very sour.  The vegitible lo mein smelled like fish.  How do you screw up everything?  I called to explain the situation and ask for a refund or a credit for our next order they told me they wouldn't do anything.  I spent ten minutes going over that we have been a good customer never complained etc we just thought it was a bad order.  However the truth is this place is just going with sub par food.    This is a restaurant I used to refer friends to and have ordered from 50 times at least.  Will never use them again.    If you are reading this be advised and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service is always fast for delivery and the food is yummy!  We always get chicken fried rice, steamed veggies and generals Tso's Chicken.  Overall good price and friendly staff."}
{"text":"First time eating food from this place. My daughter and I loved it! Delivery time and service was outstanding! Highly recommend order from this place.  (Note: never been to the actual restaurant. )"}
{"text":"Came here once with a coworker for our lunch break and had high hopes because various Yelpers rated it highly as a \"New York Style\" Chinese food place. So I ordered the pork fried rice, chicken wings and used the packets of duck sauce they had lying around. My coworker is from the east coast so she assured me the pork fried rice and the duck sauce were all part of what you could expect from a Chinese restaurant back East. The food was decent. I wasn't jumping up and down about it but it hit the spot. There were other factors, however, that kind of decided this place's fate as far as being part of our \"rotation.\" Got the fountain drink and it was flat as a tortilla. Blech. Then my coworker grabbed the last set of chopsticks so when the dude behind the counter that we ordered from brought our food, I asked him if I could get a pair of chopsticks. Immediately I figured out what was so \"New York Style\" about this place. He gave me this look like \"hey retard, they're right here - did you even bother to look you lazy gwai-lo?\" He pointed to the drawer right at the counter and opened it as if he were instructing a little kid and was probably about to say SEE? HERE THEY ARE! Except, of course, there weren't any. So he turned back to me with an \"oh well\" look and shrugged. After that he went to the shelves behind the counter and lifted a few boxes here and there and then yelled back \"Use a fork!\" Customer service at it's finest. LOL. While we sat and ate (we were the only dine-in customers for most of the time we were there) numerous customers would drive up to the front of the store, turn off the engine and order takeout. Perhaps this is a New York thing but there was plenty of parking in stalls where normal people would park. None of these folks were physically handicapped or carrying loads of boxes on a dolly or ordering for the entire office - just personal takeout. But I get it. Old habits are hard to break and perhaps a NY style Chinese restaurant complete with NY style attitude clicks on that NY state of mind - there's parking RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT- HURRY UP AND GRAB IT BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE DOES!!! But even that wasn't enough to sway me. What did it for me and my coworker was the order-taking dork at the counter clearing his throat every few minutes as if he were ready to hock a loogie. WTF!?!?! My coworker and I would look at each other and try not to laugh out loud. Was he adding his own special sauce to all the take-out orders? We never heard the actual \"spit\" but it was enough to spoil our NY style Chinese lunch. If you really gotta, don't dine in - takeout or delivery for sure."}
{"text":"Below average.  I ordered my food spicy and instead of Mongolian beef they delivered what can best be described as \"wet beef\".  No spice at all, not only lack of heat but a lack of any flavor at all.  Extremely bland.  If you are very hungry and happen to be standing right outside Red Dragon you might stop in.  Otherwise there are so many better places nearby."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Used to go here all the time, just moved back and so far they have been great!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Lunch specials are big portions, yummy and cheap $5-6, including soup or drink.  The problem is there's no heat or ac, so if you go in the hottest or coldest parts of the year, expect to sweat or freeze.  And they made the dirty dining report recently so my gf won't let me go there anymore."}
{"text":"Went to order to go since other reviews said delivery was shotty, the place was a hole in the wall, small and dirty. You can see into the kitchen and it looked very messy and unclean. Still have it a shot so I ordered by numbers as they requested and when we came back to pick it up the lady said my order was taking longer because of the spare ribs... Thing is I didn't order the spare ribs, and when I told her that she basically said I was lying and that I did. She kept saying I ordered the ribs and both myself and my friend kept telling her she was wrong. She ended up not apologizing, handed me back $0.50 even though she didn't undo the tax she originally charged me and gave me dirty looks. Worst customer service EVER!   Plus side was that the food was actually good (got the crab rangoons and shrimp and garlic sauce even though the shrimp dish hardly had any shrimp), so there's that. Too bad I won't ever go back because of the service.  1 star for the service, 3.5 stars for the food so 2 stars overall it is..."}
{"text":"Large portions, well priced, standard hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. The General Tso's chicken is delicious, so is the chicken with broccoli, and I love how the Mongolian Beef has a little kick to it. The fried rice is so so, but the Egg drop soup and Hot and Sour Soups are quite tasty.   I am docking a star, because it is dirty inside of there and the tables are sticky. It's also very small inside of there, with a limited drink selection.  However, for I think's 5.75 at lunch, you can get Pork fried rice, a large helping of General Tso's chicken, and your choice of soup. By the time I get done eating lunch I need a siesta, most of the time I can't finish all the food and usually need to get a Monster or something else to stay awake the last half of my day."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  The BEST pork & broccoli in town.  Not a over priced fancy restaurant but just great food at a very responsible price. Also the pork fried rice is one the best I have ever had Love this place"}
{"text":"I am a fan.  Good chinese take-out.  We order at least once a week, they have a lo cal menu for my wife and im a big fan of the lo-mein.  Happy to have found such good eats so near the house!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't eat AT the Red Dragon, but I would definitely order take out from this restaurant. In fact, I do order out regularly from them. The restaurant itself is a hole-in-the-wall. But the food...possibly the best Chinese food in Chandler! It's New York-style Chinese food, so there's lo mein and cold sesame noodles on the menu. Two of my favorites. The chicken with string beans and fresh ginger is really good. So is the jumbo shrimp with black bean sauce."}
{"text":"It's a little dive but a couple friends raved about this place so thought I'd try it. Called for take out and ordered dishes that you can't go wrong with like sweet and sour chicken and lomein. When I picked it up I liked that I can see into the kitchen and the prep process. But the food was mediocre at best; it was super bland and lacked the flavors. The sweet and sour chicken was over cooked along with the lomein chicken. The sauces were watery and tasteless. The only good thing out of that order was steamed rice honestly. Glad in tried it but itnreconfirms that I shall stick to my old favorite places."}
{"text":"the folks at my work would order this food quite often.  This doesn't say much  considering my coworkers love for strange underwhelming establishments.  You could fry a roach, call it Orange Chicken, and my coworkers will back weekly!(see Ben V.'s review)  I ordered delivery one time and was grossed out enough that I ended up throwing everything away after the first bite.  I eventually implemented a rule that we would no longer provide business to this restaurant after a terrible call we received from them.  Our company would order delivery almost weekly and would always throw quite a bit of money at this business.. Furthermore the tip would always be VERY generous.  Until one day we left a tip of... (please play dramatic countdown piano riff in your head here) 10 DOLLARS!  AHHHHHH!!! With the next order that was placed, the business contacted us to complain of the size of our tip, stating they weren't sure if they could deliver our current order if we are only going to tip blah blah blah.  Thats right, they complained about only getting a 10 dollar tip for the delivery. (the bill was only about 40-50 dollars) .  You are far better off sticking to local joints that are not only delicious but are grateful for your business. (TOTT's, dragon express, etc....)"}
{"text":"After ordering a hand full of times over the years, this was never my go-to place... until recently.  Two visits, four different orders - all good!  Well, \"all\" except the Egg Drop soup which my husband said wasn't.   They really don't have a dine-in kinda atmosphere goin on, so take-out is your best bet.  On your first visit, I suggest you order (try) one of their house combinations which are a generous sampling of four different menu items. Order the full size versions after identifying your favorites.  The General Tso's Chicken and House Lo-Mein are both excellent!  Large portions equal dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow.  Prices seem reasonable too.  And...they're open late!  Until 10:30 Friday and Saturday and 10:00 every other day."}
{"text":"I was craving some authentic Chinese food this evening.  Not Panda Express or anything like that.  We ordered the Spicy Dumplings which were fantastic, Kung Pao Chicken and the Chicken Lo Mein for the kids.  Food was excellent and the best part is they delivered it to us.  We will definitely eat here again.  I would recommend to everyone.  I didn't think it was expensive at all either."}
{"text":"Today a friend ordered Orange Chicken and when it was delivered he found a Roach in his Chicken. Never Ordering from there!"}
{"text":"So we ordered from Red Dragon last night in Chandler and I ordered soup and also an order of noodles.  I ate the soup last night and put the noodles in the fridge and pulled them out today for lunch.  As I was eating, I pulled at what I thought was one of my dog's black hairs (it happens a lot in this pet filled house) and instead of just a hair, I pulled out A DISGUSTING BUG. It wasn't a hair at all, it was an ANTENNA.  I'm posting photos of this creature here as well. To me... it looks like some kind of small roach... which is making me want to vomit.    I called the restaurant and informed them of the issue and the girl offered to refund the cost of this dish.  I said no, I want a full refund for the whole order.  For starters, it's the least you can do.  This isn't a matter of me just not liking the dish, there is an INSECT in it, and I have, unfortunately, already eaten half of it before realizing there was a disgusting bug inside.  So just out of principle, I think the whole order should be refunded.  Additionally, my roommate is now unable to eat HIS leftovers because... duh.  Why would he want to continue eating his food from the same restaurant?  So it's not just one dish going to waste, it's actually three of the four that we ordered.  So yes, I want a full refund.  At this point, she starts asking me questions that implied I was lying.  Asking why I didn't call last night if I placed the order last night.  Twice I had to explain the concept of leftovers to her.  She also asked me if I took the food OUTSIDE.  Why yes, of COURSE I did.  Who doesn't like eating spicy, hot Chinese food outside in the desert on a hot afternoon after a rain?  Muggy, hot weather is the BEST environment in which to eat a hot dish.  She then told me she couldn't do anything until a manager was there. I said okay, when will a manager be there?  She somehow had NO IDEA when there would be a manager.  That a manager might not even show up today.  Right.    I got pretty mad at this point because it was clear she was trying to shoo me away and act like a manager wasn't going to be available (when I'm pretty sure it was a manager yelling in the background), so I raised my voice and told her I expected to hear from a manager by 6:00PM tonight to receive a full refund for the disgusting bug in my food.  I may have said \"disgusting f@*%ing bug\"... at which point she hung up on me.  Fine.  I called GrubHub, which is how I placed the order, and they were WONDERFUL.  They contacted the restaurant as well, and they told them the same thing.  Refund for the bug food only.  But the girl at GrubHub understood completely how disgusting this was and that obviously my roommate didn't want to eat the rest of his food either.  So GrubHub refunded the difference and even sent me a voucher for a discount for my next order.  Which will obviously be from a different restaurant.  I wouldn't have made any of this public over the bug itself.  I actually understand that bugs happen.  Maybe it was in the produce... but maybe it was in the gross kitchen.  I have no idea.  I wouldn't have ordered from Red Dragon again, but I wouldn't have made a big deal about it.  But because they treated me like a liar and like I had nothing better to do than make fake claims about bugs in my food over $34, now I feel like I want people to know that Red Dragon not only has bugs in their food, but they treat their customers really poorly as well.  This place obviously places no value on either cleanliness or service, so I really suggest you avoid it at all costs."}
{"text":"It was average.  I got the sweet and sour chicken.  Everything was cold when I got it, especially the fried rice and egg drop soup.  Delivery driver was rude and told me I didn't meet the minimum delivery dollar amount, which they shouldn't have accepted the order if it didn't meet the requirement versus scolding me when delivered."}
{"text":"I love Red Dragon and have been coming here about 4 years. I have been meaning to write a review this entire time. Food is always good, they never have an \"off\" night... Quality is consistent. Food is ready quickly, and you get very large portions. They have great lunch specials too (every day of the week). I highly recommend! This is my go-to Chinese spot."}
{"text":"After reading all of the great reviews on this place, my roommate and I had to try. I was skeptical because I believe it's hard to distinguish great chinese food. Most of it tastes the same to me. Now after visiting Red Dragon I realize how ignorant I am. It was fantastic. Yes it's in a crappy strip mall but it's not made to eat inside, it's takeout all the way. I got the pan fried dumpings (amazing, fluffy and the inside tasted real!.) I also got the wonton soup which was cheap and delicious. It wasn't chewy like most places and was piping hot. For my entree I got the sweet and sour chicken. The chicken was fluffy breading but also crunchy and the meat was cooked absolutely perfect. Not to mention they give you a ton of food so it's well worth the value. My roommate went with the general tso's, crab rangoon and another dish I couldn't tell what it was but he loved it and he's a graduate of culinary school. The great reviews are correct, this is the best takeout around!"}
{"text":"Let my start by saying I go here all the time. This fact notwithstanding, I have to admit that its definitely not my favorite Chinese food restaurant in the area. They advertise themselves as New York Style Chinese food, which, since I'm not from New York, doesnt mean a whole lot to me. Though from what I've tasted, I'm assuming that means not as authentic and a little Americanized. The one thing that constantly frustrates me about Red Dragon is that I order something having a guess about how its going to be and it ends up being nothing like it. Once I ordered the crispy chicken thinking it would be the deep fried chicken with crispy skin that you can get in most Chinese restaurants, and it ended up being this shaved, deep fried chicken in a sweet sauce. Utterly disappointing, though it wasnt necessarily a bad dish. The fried rice here is hit or miss- a hit being a passable version, while a miss ends up being partially cooked rice \"crispies\". Their egg foo yung is pretty good, and their -enter choice of meat- with broccoli/veggies is well done, if not a little too oily. The one thing I like about this place especially is their soups, which are very inexpensive- $3 for a quart- though they are premade and the amount of ingredients reflects the price. But I actually like simplicity so it suits me just fine.  Unfortunately, for most of the things on the menu, and I've tried quite a few, there is sweet undertone accompanying them. Also, a quick note...this place has only 3 small tables, so unless you are a very small party or eating a quick meal, I would opt for the take-out.  The one great advantage they have over other places is, as others have mentioned, the price, and also that they are open till 10 on most nights. If another restaurant is open, I'll usually skip Red Dragon, but if I have to choose between so-so Chinese food and Taco Bell just up the street, its really no decision at all."}
{"text":"The place is filthy. The staff is rude or service is slow and they act like they really do not want to be there.   Kitchen is OPEN you can see the staff working, and the kitchen looks dirty. Food is so so, and even eating IN the small dining area (dirty tables and floor) the food comes out warm not hot.   They started out as a great place to get take out or dine in, now it is just bad.  Definitely NOT be going back."}
{"text":"We live around the corner and have tried many other local places. We always go back to Red Dragon because of quality. Price? Who cares. I have MS and cannot eat processed food with MSG or other artificial preservatives and this place rocks! The veggies are so fresh you can see then pulling the strings off the pea pods and cutting fresh broccoli. Not greasy or full of gristle. We go every few weeks and will keep going!"}
{"text":"Been going to the dragon for a few years now and the food is always excellent.  I think they have the best wonton soup in town and the combination fried rice is on point.  As far as the taste and cost of the food they get 5 stars but because the place always looks a bit on the dirty side I only gave them 4 stars."}
{"text":"So, we had a flyer posted on our door and after looking at the menu and prices. We decided to try it for lunch (11am to 3pm lunch specials). We ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce, garlic pork and pork chow mein. Each lunch special comes with soup or soda and your choice of rice. We had egg drop soup and pork fried rice. The soup was very tasting and this is the first time I ordered pork fried rice and it actually had fried pork in it!!!  The meals were small but enough to satisfy. They were very delicious! We will be ordering again :)"}
{"text":"Recommended from a co-worker. Super close to home. As others have stated, the place is dirty. The food handled is suspect at best. The food was barely average. I keep hearing that Arizona has poor options for Chinese food and this place confirms those opinions."}
{"text":"The #24 General Tso's chicken, was really good. delivery service was a little slow but the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Chinese restaurant around. I'm from NJ, so I crave NY-style chow mein (lots of crisp onions, celery and sprouts). This is the only place I've found in AZ that can do it right. I have never had a bad meal here!  The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is the location is a little small, dingy and sometimes the staff isn't very friendly. But I am willing to forgive all of that in exchange for excellent, delicious food. :-)"}
{"text":"This is my new go to place for Chinese delivery. They're prompt, the food is always hot and good. I love their cold noodles with sesame sauce, general tsos, and especially the crab Rangoon! They don't skimp on the sauce, and have always brought me extra upon request. definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place has the best boneless ribs and the sesame chicken . Very friendly and clean . If you want New York style , this place comes very close .. We order every week from here ."}
{"text":"I have been getting takeout from this restaurant for at least the past 4 or 5 years and it appears to be rather exclusively a take out place.  I have to say they have been consistent with their quality, large portion sizes and efficiency!  Over all the food is delicious and very much like New York style Chinese food.  They have 3 or 4 tables but I have never seen anyone eating there but they do a huge take out business.  When you go to pick up your order you can observe 3 to 4 chefs feverishly working at huge woks, it's fun to watch.  You get great value as the ingredients are fresh and abundant and inexpensive.  I enjoy their hot and sour soup, especially at $3.25 a quart.  Last night we ordered Shrimp Royal (10.95) loaded with many strips of pork, sliced chicken breast and a dozen large shrimp, bamboo shoots, pea pods, white and green onions, all in a slightly spicy sauce, a delicious dish.  We also had House Special Chow Fun (7.75) with lots of wide flat noodles with chicken breast, bbq pork and medium shrimp and some sliced beef in a great tasting mild sauce.  Lunches average from $5 - 5.75 from 11AM -3PM. I plan to keep ordering from them, it's good stuff."}
{"text":"This place reminds of Wong's Palace in Tempe but not as good.  For some reason, the food just doesn't hit the spot.  The chicken chow fun was tasteless and was just flat out goopy.  All of the noodles just stuck to each other."}
{"text":"I love this place. I order from them frequently and have never been dissatisfied with customer service and efficiency. It's also super authentic, which I appreciate.  There has only been once dish I wasn't crazy about but usually great"}
{"text":"been here for a decade now. the Food is greasy and tasty just how I like it. if you want non-greasy Chinese food this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"I have moved here for Nebraska a few months ago and have visited many different local chinese restaurants. This is by far the best chinese restaurant i have been to. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"The general tso's chicken was excellent. The place is pretty small, but you can see the kitchen and the help is exactly what you expect from a good oriental restaurant."}
{"text":"What a surprise this place is.  I hate flyers on my door and nearly tossed it, but something made me save this menu.  The other night I had a craving for chinese food and dug this up.  We ordered their coconut shrimp (it came with steamed broccoli), chicken chow fun and eggplant.  I think it's safe to say I've found my new favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley.  I went to go pick it up since it's close to the house.  I'm directionally challenged so what should have taken me a 10 minute drive ended up being a 20 minute drive.  It's located on the corner of Alma School and Warner in the Goodyear plaza.  It didn't help that the traffic light was out on the corner so traffic was backed up.  I can't wait to go back and try other dishes.  The chow fun was to DIE FOR.  I'm a chow fun fanatic and I was in love!  Noodles were not super soggy and the containers are not your standard cardboard fare, either.  The coconut shrimp was fab - the sauce was on the side.  My only complaint is that there were no holes for the hot air to escape so the batter was a bit soggy.  No worries, it was still scrumptious.  The eggplant is flavorful.  It was not drowning in soy sauce.  Just enough for your rice.  Oh...and the rice is FREE.  You don't have to order it separately and be charged extra like some places in the valley.  They claim to NOT use MSG in their dishes and that's the truth.  I'm allergic to MSG and I would know in under 3 minutes...  The overall ambiance is really more to go than in dining.  They have a picnic table set up that consists of one bench.  Now that I know where I can find this gem, I'll be sure to go back.  If you haven't tried it, go...NOW."}
{"text":"Lets just say I love that I can order Chinese food and have it delivered to my place! Came home on a Sunday night after being gone all weekend and the kids and I were starving, so I said lets order something, so we ordered beef fried rice, crab puffs (my fav!!!) orange chicken, pork lo main and after we placed the order company showed up and I asked him if he was hungry and he said yea I told him we just ordered some chinese, do you want some, he said ok, but didn't know what to order, so off we went to Red Dragon, my phone order was already out the door by the time I got there, he ordered pepper beef and egg rolls, we took it home and had a good dinner! Now I have a take out menu at the house LOL."}
{"text":"Excellent, handmade style won ton soup, egg foo and egg rolls!"}
{"text":"we've eaten here a couple times, but were pretty underwhelmed both times.  the reviews on here sounded promising, and i wanted to give it a chance, which is why we ate there more than once. probably my biggest complaint is that the chicken gets reallllly soggy in the sauce.  we tried several dishes and each one was the same.  i guess maybe its all according to taste. i do have to say that i did try the soups, and those were very good. i was sad because this place is 2 seconds from the house."}
{"text":"Poor service.... Four workers present and no took my order at the counter. There was only one other person in the restaurant who was also waiting. They were trying very hard to ignore customers so I'm guessing they did not want to be bothered by them."}
{"text":"Ordered Online Last night and was very disappointed. First off we noted that we wanted Table Served Hot Mustard (the kind you get in the restaurants in a dish) and Hot Chili Oil. We got packets of Hot Mustard and no Chili Oil. The General Tao chicken was over cooked and there was only two Won tons in the House Won ton soup (serves two). There are 15 Chinese restaurants in the area so I would have expected a lot better."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with only a few tables but they do lots of takeout and delivery orders.  Also, they have about 4 cooks in the kitchen, which you can plainly see cooking the food.  One word...fantastic.  Great flavor, great size portions and great prices. This is a do-again."}
{"text":"Definitely the closest to anything I have found in my 20yrs here in the valley other than going to ny in itself. Best Chinese food around and consistent unlike the place closer to me which costs more and you don't know if it's going to be good."}
{"text":"After looking around for good Chinese food in the area, we tried this place. We had it delivered and for $30 had enough food for two people for two nights!  The spicy dumplings are a must try. Different than other dumplings. The best hot and sour soup I have found in AZ. Beef lo mein was good. Moo Goo Gai was good. As was the sweet and sour shrimp. I think we have found put go to chinese take out."}
{"text":"This place is good for me to get in and get out with something delicious. I like their sweet and sour chicken plate but to be honest, the egg rolls are my favorite. They are so delicious and I couldn't believe how cheap the meals were for a full entree. For a place to get my quick Chinese craving, this is my place!"}
{"text":"We tried Red Dragon on the recommendation of friends...quite disappointed.  I agree another poster that the recipes at Red Dragon seem to be different from the norm.  The General Tso's Chicken was sweet and not at all spicy.  The Mongolian Beef was so spicy that my cheeks are still burning; I have never had spicy Mongolian Beef before, and it was swimming in a brown soy-like sauce and no crisp white rice noodles, as traditional.  And why was the fried rice ORANGE, not brown? I would not go out of my way to return, but if in the neighborhood I might try it again---maybe it was just an off night?"}
{"text":"Holy cow...If you have read my other reviews on yelp or trip advisor, you would be confused as to why I am giving Red Dragon such a bad review.  I probably spent like $2000 dollars there over the last 7 years.  That being said, I order food at 5:40 pm on Sunday night.  They told me it would be 45 minutes...At 1 hour and 15 minutes I called and they said that the food was on the way.  At 1 hour and 35 minutes we called back and asked about the problem...The manager hung up on us....  We ordered PITA JUNGLE after that...We then called back just to see what they would say...They offered 20% off...Really?  Save your dumb pennies and give me better service."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices for a lot of food.  Lunch specials are typically around $5 and include drink or soup.  Like typical fast food Chinese places, they use an ubiquitous \"brown sauce\" base in most of their entrees which they add an extra ingredient here or there to make it a \"Szechwan sauce\" or \"garlic sauce\".  As for the quality, just OK.  I had an order of egg drop soup that was the most gelatinous soup I had ever seen.  When your plastic container of soup jiggles when you move it rather than sloshing around, and when your soup sticks to your spoon and after some effort, lazily drips down when you turn the spoon upside down, you know you've put too much thickener in your soup!  In addition, I had a fountain soda from here once instead of the soup, and it tasted pretty flat.  So, it's not the best Chinese food out there, but it's a good deal for what you get."}
{"text":"Red Dragon is probably my favorite quick Chinese food in town. I first moved to Phoenix in November 2004 and lived in an apartment at Dobson & Warner. Red Dragon was a place my roommate and I discovered then and continued to use until we moved to another part of town in 2008. Luckily for me, I moved back to that part of town earlier this year. It is maybe a little pricier than other places - $11 for the General Tso chicken and fried rice, but it is worth it. I have never been disappointed and the portions are large enough that I usually split it in half."}
{"text":"Good size portions, delicious food. My whole family really liked it all! I think we have found our new go to spot for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"It was a late night that day and I was hungry. I found this restaurant and drove to the llocation and got lost. The location was behind the intersection.   This place close at 10pm which is very helpful for people who hungry after 9pm with a nice price Asian food and fast or \"to-go\" style.  This \"to go\" concept restaurant have few tables for customer who want to eat in there. When you entered the door, you should go straight to the counter, order the foods, pay, and wait for the food.  When the food came to my table, they served with rice without spoon or fork.  It seem they expected all their customer was not a \"first-time\" customer that \"who knows where they put their spoon or fork.\"  They didn't say anything until I stand up, asked them, where was the spoon or the fork. They just said, \"Oh, here!\" (It was plastic pork and spoon infront of them which is infront of me on the counter. Gosh, I didn't see that..lol). Well, I expected if you served the food, it should come with fork or spoon, at least. Lol...  You served yourself for the water in the cup on the soda machine.  I ordered beef curry that night. The food taste was average. I found a bloody meat swimming in my curry, so I asked them to cook it back. The guy behind the counter said nothing (not even say sorry or whatsoever).  I might go back to this place if I am  in an \"emergency hungry\" situation such as hungry after 9pm."}
{"text":"Tasty New York style Chinese at a fair price, plus, they deliver to a fairly wide area (comparatively). You'll find most, if not all, of your favorites are available here. I really enjoy the Orange Chicken, shrimp rolls, and the Chicken Fried Rice. Vegetarian is possible with their menu options too.  The service is not the best, but it's not too bad, about the same as you'd get in a fast food restaurant, which would normally justify a 3-star or less rating, but the food taste / value redeems them and gets them back up to a 4-star."}
{"text":"Damn this Chinese food is freaking awesome! I consider myself an aficionado of Asian food, and I've tasted my fair share in both east and west coast Chinatowns and I will tell you this place is authentic and delicious. To speak to the previous post which said that the recipes are different, it's New York style Chinese food, ie it's different, and it is just like NYC style Chinese food and yes, the fried rice is orange and the pork has pink food coloring, it's all good! Couple of things I noticed, first we got 5 dishes and none of them were swimming in grease, in fact it was not greasy at all. I didn't get that bloated-sick-to-your-stomach feeling that I get with most of the run of the mill Chinese food that's sold here. Second, they use real chicken and not that weird, white, frozen chicken \"food product\" that all the Chinese restaurants seem to be using these days. It's cheap and they deliver. Seriously? We ordered pork egg foo young, most places use frozen patties, this was definitely homemade and not frozen. A lot of places put the filling in the gravy on top of a plain egg patty with sprouts but they put the filling inside the patty which is way better. We also had a combo plate with spicy chili shrimp, pepper steak, chicken stick and fried rice, awesome. Then we had garlic pork and tomato beef. All of it was really good. This is my new go-to Chinese food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wife and I hadn't eaten here before and were in the mood for a \"linner\" take out so we gave it a try.  In a nutshell - a success.  Food was hot when we ate despite a 15-minute drive home.  Quantity was more than one could eat at one sitting and everything except the little bag of chips was very tasty.  The chips were stale.  We had hot & sour soup, pork fried rice.  I had green beans & beef and she had shrimp in lobster sauce and won ton soup.  My beef was tender and tasty.  The beans were crisp and the ginger sauce was perfect.  Her only complaint was that there were only 3 won tons in her soup instead of 4.  Pretty great recommendation.  The order was packaged nicely inside a heavy paper bag with an outer plastic bag to guard against moisture.  It took about 10 minutes to prepare and the price was right to boot so we will be back."}
{"text":"Food is good enough.  Nothing special, but not bad. Portions were enough for 4 people to share and the prices were about $1 less per item than others.  I was terribly disappointed that they used flour tortillas for their mushu.  For that, I give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"My neighbors recommended this to me so I thought I would give it a try. I ordered an extra egg roll, hot and sour soup and kung pao chicken which came with pork fried rice. (C18 on menu). The egg roll was okay, not the best I've had but better than some. The hot and sour soup was so bad and tasteless, it wasn't even hot or sour. The chips they gave me for the soup we're so greasy and tasted like day-old oil that I could not even eat them. The pork fried rice was good and the Kung Pao chicken was okay but it is labeled as a hot spicy dish spice... it wasn't. Overall the meal was teastless, everything needed salt.  I might have hit them on a bad night, there are a lot of people working in the back so could be confusision on their part. Not running back just yet.  I didn't see any bugs like one of the other review but I'm not surprised.  Too many other choices arould here that I will mark this one off."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The food is average although the portions are large. The wonton soup was good. The soda machine was broken. The \"free\" egg rolls were forgotten when we were served. They arrived after we had finished our meal. It was a cold day and there was no heat in the dining room which was freezing. Not much upside to this dining experience. I won't be back."}
{"text":"As previously mentioned here, if you're looking for NYC style Chinese Takeout Red Dragon will not disappoint. It's as close to what I grew up eating in Queens or Long Island as I've found west of the Hudson River. Best of all, you can have Dinner for 2 for just about $25 with Soup & Appetizers. Delivery to my hotel was within promised time and it was hot & correct, something that's quite rare when it comes to delivery to hotels in my experience. It was without question my best experience of delivery of Chinese Food when traveling. I ordered what I call my \"litmus test\" of fundamental dishes and none disappointed. Chicken Chow Mein (crispy noodles) Pork Egg Roll, Won Ton Soup and Roast Pork Fried Rice. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll try some other dishes now that I have confidence in their abilities."}
{"text":"*MAY GET FOOD POISONING if you eat here  I ordered from there lunch menu and got hot and sour soup, fried wontons , and orange chicken. First off the hot and sour soup looked and tasted like egg drop soup...only had two spoon fulls of that. The fried wontons were good. The orange chicken was awful, way too much sauce and tasted dry and soggy. TO TOP IT ALL OFF I GOT FOOD POISONING :-( do not eat here unless you want to risk getting sick. Made me scared of Chinese food for a while....and I'm Chinese lol now I only order Singapore rice noodles,  and that is a hard dish to find."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Chicken fried rice, chicken and vegetables and crab ragtoon. Wonton soup was delicious as well. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Cheap, cheap, cheap. And I don't mean that in a bad way.  Red Dragon is one of those great little hole in the wall Chinese places, but with uncommonly low lunch prices and better taste than most. Dinner prices are about average. Their soups are always steaming hot, their entrees tend to be cooked just right, and their rice is the perfect combination of sticky and fluffy.  They can take a little longer than some other restaurants to have your order ready, but the result is worth the wait. Red Dragon also claims not to use MSG, which may be a point in their favor for some diners.  It's not fine dining Chinese and doesn't pretend to be, but they're definitely toward the top of the heap for fast, tasty Asian comfort food."}
{"text":"This is a typical Chinese take-out place. Given four stars under that pretense. Definitely not PF Chang's but the food is really delicious and not very expensive. I'm stuck in the rut of Chop Suey & Veggie Delight in garlic sauce.   The people who work here aren't very friendly but it's take out so they don't really need to be.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I eat here once a week sometimes twice, my favorite in the Phoenix area and close to my house. incredible tasting and great service and the prices are good. the serving size is great. for vegans they have a lot to choose from our favorite is Garlic Tofu & Broccoli. yummmmmmmmmmyyyy!!!"}
{"text":"Great take out, delivery took a while, but I assume they were busy. Will be ordering again, just have to keep in mind it takes 30 min+"}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant today. Food was good and portions were Awesome! We had some left to take home for dinner! Will definately go back if in the area craving Chinese food. Prices were great! Only $22 for 3 meals. Oh yes and for those who can't eat Msg...no worries, they don't use the stuff!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of there food. It has always tasted better then most places but I am currently sitting in here as I write this and I am very bothered due to the fact that I just watched them drop a handful of meat on the ground and pick it up and put it into the pan!!!!!  Glad I got to see it because I will not be back."}
