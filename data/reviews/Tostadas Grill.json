{"text":"This place is amazing! My husband and I went here for his birthday and he loved it, being Venezuelan! Prettt authentic and great service"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, lovely arepas. The tostones are highly recommended. All wonderful - thanks."}
{"text":"Great patacon, full of flavor and enough to make you full. It is not what you would call a cheap meal, though, but is certainly something different to what we normally have \"to go\""}
{"text":"The place is nice but i ordered take out. Not going to lie. The AREPA was delicious. However at $6.75 plus tax. It was a very small size. I was not full. I recommend getting a side or at least 2. Which makes it very pricey.   I ordered the chicken and beef mixed arepa and it was delicious. First time trying it- I asked for spicy and they said they cant make it spicy but then they gave me a killer hot sauce and salsa. Which was really spicy. The actual item is much like a pita shawarma - however much smaller. It tasted amazing as there was corn flavor in the shell. The pulled meat was nice and chewy. I like it a lot actually- however price point for product is my issue.  Might go back to try their steak dinner for $10."}
{"text":"So after coming back to Tostados grills over a dozen times since my last review I can confidently say they are worth my 4 star rating (an extra star over my initial 3 star rating). Service has been consistently fast and from a smiling waitress. Food has always been great! I have taken coworkers here and my friend who is gluten intolerant (celiac). She has never had any issues with the food and always suggests to go here when we get together. Thumbs up! A great little neighborhood latin restaurant! :)"}
{"text":"Tostadas Grill is thoroughly satisfying, they hit my spot. After being made to feel genuinely welcome, our server and host took the time to make suggestions based on our Celiac dietary restrictions.  Gluten free safe here.  Each dish is freshly prepared to order and the menu and flavors are authentic.  The beef soup at satisfies the soul.  We also enjoyed the Patacon, some empenadas and to drink Papelon with lime, Tamarind and Chichas.  Each drink has it's own unique characteristics and are pleasantly refreshing in their own ways.  Will be headed back very soon to enjoy more of their tasty food."}
{"text":"This is the best Venezuelan food in north Toronto. The selection is wide, from patacon to arepa. Food is very tasty as well. I highly recommend their empanadas and patacon."}
{"text":"Great Venezuelan food.  Juice was a bit over priced but everything else was good value."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch.  Had a chicken and avocado arepa and a side of yuca.  Magic.  Absolutely delicious.  They bring you three sauces with it - mayo/ketchup, hot sauce, and some kind of avocado cilantro mayo possibly?  I couldn't put my finger on the last one.  All yummy in their own way.  Totally recommend."}
