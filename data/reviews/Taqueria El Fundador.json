{"text":"Garbage! Bad customer service .Rude people! food is expensive not the quality for the price. Would give it one star but I gota say the Horchata is pretty good"}
{"text":"This place might look like a hole in the wall joint from the outside but I promise you they have delicious Mexican food at a awesome price, so if you don't have time for a restaurant but want authentic Mexican food at affordable prices, then this place will satisfy your tummy.                                                                                                  My favorite is there carna asada,either in a burrito with there awesome beans or stuffed in there corn tortilla tacos with there signature red sauce.....p.s there also have an incredible green sauce that you have to ask for."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The pastor and asada rocks, whether it is  a burro, taco, or an amazing torta that is on the best bread ever."}
{"text":"We were there this weekend and were pretty dissapointed. We love their food and have been loyal customers for many many years. I always ask them to put cheese in my burrito and they always charge me like $1.75 or something like that. Paying is not the problem since I always get cheese in my burrito and therefore I already expect it. I mentioned to the cashier the last time I was there they charged me for cheese and they did not add it to my burrito and that maybe she should waive the charge this time to make up for that time. I know its just $1.75 and not a big deal, but it was to them! The cashier called another cashier and she said that I should have complained then and told the cashier to make sure and charge me for the cheese and she walked away. Can you say RUDEEE!!! I payed for my darn cheese that I did not recieve last time. So I wasnt going to sit there and argue with her over a darn dollar. We ate and left and we are never coming back. $1.75 is not the problem, their attitude is the problem. Im a paying customer and if youre going to charge me at the very least treat me with respect."}
{"text":"Good food decent price, can't really complain about anything but I could do without the loud jukebox! Other than that great place to eat!"}
{"text":"this place has the best carne asada burrito i have ever had. I have been coming here my whole life because my father has eaten here for even longer. i know people that will go here and buy 30 burritos just to take them back home to other states. this place is great! alot of memories."}
{"text":"Dang! Stopped here quite randomly to grab some lunch and it was delicious. I had a carne asada torta and will definitely be back to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Tacos AL PASTOR!!! enough said. You want tacos, burros, tortas, tostadas. They can help satisfy the craving. The spot can be shady at night, but if you AIN'T SKURRED, try it. You will find something here you can enjoy."}
{"text":"I decided to go here based on the other reviews.  I ordered the tacos (carne asada, pollo and pastor) and the pineapple drink.  The tacos are really small so I ordered 4 and was surprised that I was struggling to eat the 4th one.  The meat is really well-seasoned and the pineapple drink was the perfect sweetness.  This is authentic Mexican, not americanized Taco Bell type of Mexican food.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Mexican food with a twist. They have these carrots that are delicious and just a little bit spicy along with your lunch. I've never seen anything quite like that before. The place is crowded popular and inexpensive. They serve authentic Mexican food as opposed to chain restaurant Mexican food."}
{"text":"Beans inside carne asada burrito.  Enough said!? No debit or credit."}
{"text":"I love this place and have been going there for years! The only thing that's bad is the 2 girls in there that always seem to have an attitude and are very rude. I would give this place a 5 start review but because of those two that are always in the front giving people bad attitude I'll give it a 3."}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall nothing fancy in a bad side of town. The food is good and inexpensive. We had the carne asada tacos they are small but good. It's reminds me of the street vendors in Rocky Point."}
{"text":"The Good:
BEST Tacos in the valley. $1 Taco Tuesdays. Tacos are not skimpy! Their Tortas are super flavorful and juicy meat! The place was packed too, so that says a lot as well. 

The Bad:
Bring cash because to use your debit card there you must perform an ATM debit withdrawal and they charge you $2 not incl. whatever your individual bank would charge you (prob. $2 additional) for not using their ATM. Too easy with technology today, they should upgrade to a POS machine. This is why the less than perfect score. Otherwise they would get a 5!"}
{"text":"I found a rock in my tripa taco and chipped my tooth . It looks like a tooth or rock. I am disgusted right now I will be there after work to speak to manager. - I talked to someone and he said they got a bad batch of meat but were still selling the tacos so I really don't understand."}
{"text":"I just ate at this place on Saturday.  Most of you (I'm willing to bet :)) don't spend a lot of time hanging out in the neighborhood of 31st Ave and Van Buren.  I teach at a school there and have been making it a point to track down any and all great little food places.  El Taquito is great.  It's bright yellow on the outside.  The inside is clean, with about 8 booths.  There was a guy singing and playing guitar (not sure if he was paid by the restaurant, or just doing his own thing).  I got the cherviche tostada, which was basically Pico de Gallo with shredded shrimp added to it on top of a fried corn tortilla.  Amazing!  It's the first time I've eaten Mexican and not felt all greasy afterwards.  Everyone else's food looked great too (the taquitos were so small!).  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I came here once, after being remodeled and not being called \"el Nuevo taquito\" anymore. The cashier was SOO rude. Her attitude seems like she hates her job and doesn't want to be there. Customer service is everything. And since I didn't have a good customer service, at that point the food doesn't really matter. You can have the best food but with the worst customer service, it's worthless."}
{"text":"You order at the counter and wait for our number to be called. Cash only. Interesting ambiance with a loud jukebox intermittently playing traditional Mexican tunes. The lengua taco was terrific with zesty green salsa. The pastor was amazing with a somewhat crispy texture, minimal fat, and smoky flavor. The service was friendly. Good prices. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Personally I did not like this place. Will not be coming back. Service was slow and I had to pay $1.00 for a very small contsiner of guacamole.  Shouldn5 it come with tacos?  Never again....by the way my stomach now hurts!  Thanks Taqueria El Fundador!  Thumbs down!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST Tacos Al Pastor in town. Had been coming to this place since 1990 when my family and I first moved to Phoenix. Since then I'd been trying other places but nothing compares to this place's tacos Al Pastor. Another one of my fave are the tacos de tripa and lengua. I hadn't have menudo here for a few years because I live far from this place but if menudo still tastes as I remember them it's so worth for you to try it if your some where near by early on the weekends."}
{"text":"Bob and I found ourselves in Phoenix. We, well I, wanted Mexican. Gotta, gotta have it sometimes. Taqueria El Funda got my attention because it was open until 10pm! 
    I ordered beans, fresh not canned, and rice with my carnitas platillos. Fabulous! Had an asada taco, also very tasty, steak seasoned and hot. The menu was posted overhead, all in Spanish. This caused a moments pause, but the girl taking the order, pleasantly helped. 
    With and English menu I would've seen my prize! A woman near me, ordering before us, had her food delivered. I had to ask about the dish. It was caldo de cameron! Soup with potatoes,  carrots and many large shrimp. Delicious! Had never had it anywhere, but it was a taste I will look for elsewhere. 
    The Taqueria was clean, friendly staff, willing to translate, food very good. If I can I will be back."}
{"text":"The tacos do not disappoint. They are located about 26 minutes away from me but its totally worth the drive. Try the el pastor tacos."}
{"text":"Tacos are good but the restaurant itself has a boring ambience. They have a couple of tvs on but for a young staff, the environment is quite dead as if I didn't already said that(lol). Some beer would be nice to have with these street style tacos. But other than that I give it a thumbs up for a in-between-the-week lunch or dinner type a meal"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while lost. All i can say is the food is okay. We got several types of tacos and a burrito, my daughter got menudo. The carnitas were HARD and dry. The carne asada was fairly chewy, inexpensive meat. If you are really hungry its okay. Tortillas weren't heated enough to make them soft. Also they are cash only and you have to withdrawl cash with a 2 dollar fee plus whatever the bank will charge me. That PLUS they charge for drink refills. Found that out AFTER I just spent 50 bucks there. Crappy surprise. 2 star food 1 star for the cash only."}
{"text":"The best tacos in the valley, with out a doubt. This place is my favorite Mex taco supplier, for burritos I go to Rito's. El Nuevo Taquito knows how to use spices and the meat is very tender and seasoned or marinaded.
Tacos are small, about three bites worth for me, they run $1.05 each so order five or more, but they are the best tacos you will ever have north of the Mex boarder. I have never given 5 stars to a restaurant before, but for this place, I do not hesitate."}
{"text":"Never dissapointed with the food here. From the breakfast burritos to the mariscos, good food all the way around. Bring cash though. If you want to use your debit card they make you withdraw with a $2 fee.."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years! We've been eating at this restaurant since way before their remodel (when building was yellow haha) and after. 
I love their carne asada tacos. Service is always great and it's easy to order.
*Only downside is that you should have cash to pay* If not, there's a mini ATM that has a $2 charge fee. I don't mind it because it's a place that I grew up eating at for over 20 years."}
{"text":"Great food great prices great staff what else could ask for oh I know tables that are bigger"}
{"text":"These guys make a pretty good taco. They're itty bitty things, just a couple of bites, but they're definitely tasty. I ordered one carne asada, one carnitas, and one pastor - all three had a nice flavor."}
{"text":"A significant improvement from the previous establishment, they actually care about quality and ensuring their customers return. One of the more enthusiastic presentations when they posted up at the Arizona Taco Festival and surely won tons of people over, their tacos are good, just not great, but I'd definitely be back if in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Their food is always fresh and delicious. If I ever want my fixing of an awesome Carne asada burrito I'll do the drive cause they are worth it. They have the same taste as I can remember when my dad would take us when we were lil...20+ years still delicious ;)"}
{"text":"Came here for a late family dinner. (8 people @ 9:30pm) they were very accommodating and allowed the two toddlers of the group to dance and enjoy the music. 

The food is pretty average and very authentic. Tacos are priced very decently. I would go back for sure. Little hole in the wall places are the best!"}
{"text":"I liked the tacos. They are by far the best tacos I've had here in Phoenix. The only thing I would change is the salsa and maybe add guacamole on the tacos. I tried the carne asada and al pastor. The place is small but very clean and the service was fast. I'm definitely coming back. 

The only bad thing is that they accept debit cards but you have to make a withdrawal with a service fee of $2. Not sure why they do it but it's better if you pay with cash."}
{"text":"Would rate it 5 but when you're not paying with cash it's a hassle. The atm is weird to work with and the lady working the register wasn't much help. Just a heads up, if you're going here take cash! Other than that the tacos are bomb.com. I ordered 1 de cabeza 1de carnitas and 1 al pastor"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for as long as I can remember. I still call it by its original name \"El Nuevo Taquito\" food here used to be great. Every Sunday I'd come here for Menudo. The last 3 weeks in a row ive shown up between 8 am and 10 am to be told \"we're out of Menudo\" like seriously? At 8 am? No freaken way. Today was the icing on the cake. Yup you guessed it, no menudo. So I ordered what I normally order. Carne asada burrito. I was beyond disappointed. Absolutely no flavor at all and was full of grease. My son's tacos were exactly the same, Excessively greasy. Only reason they're getting 2 stars is because the beans were good. I definitely won't be back anytime soon. Will have to find another place to eat on Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"Best street Taco's in the valley. Been coming here since I was a kid. Always consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"They have very good tacos I tried them all and they have a really good burritos half and half of carne asada and tripas is the bomb!"}
{"text":"This was the most unpleasant torta experience of my life....   I ordered tacos for my family...they were fair at best...the worst carnitas torta i have ever had...it was served on soggy sub sandwich bread...and a sliced up pork chop with lettuce and tomato.  Never again...there are a lot of other choices....pick one."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! I called to place a pick up order, I was put on hold, after 8 min on hold I decided to drive there. When I got there I told them I had been on hold for over 13 min. They tell me that no, I'm not on hold. So I show her my phone and say, so you're telling me that this is not your number. She then looks at the other two girls and asks did you put her on hold, they both say it wasn't them. So I tell them that I don't care who put me on hold anymore, all I want is someone to take my order. She then explains that the calls are placed on hold until they are done helping the person in front of then. I tell her, i highly doubt that its taken him (I point at guy at register) 14 plus minutes to order. So again, i ask that my order be taken. She then tells me that I have to wait until she's done helping the people in line. So I get in the back of the line wait till its my turn. Then when the cashier is taking my order the phone rings. She picks it up and takes a phone order. After that first call ended the phone ringe again, and she takes ANOTHER phone order before she finishes with mine. What the fuck! Not once did anyone apologize. The food wasn't for me, or I would of taken my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time the other day! Not bad however los tacos de tripa were kinda soggy =( they taste better crispy. We had a big order for to go asada, tripa, cabeza and al pastor tacos were flavorful my favorite were los tacos de al pastor. Se les olvido hecharle la salsa!! But that's ok next time. I'd go back my husband and children were satisfied."}
{"text":"Service is always friendly and they have the best tacos Al pastor in the city!  All the food is amazing and tastes like what my grandparents made in Douglas, AZ.  No complaints about the price too and the menudo was definitely what the doctor ordered.  I've been coming here since I was a kid and the food is still the same and always amazing.  Very consistent.  Open late and they have all sodas in a bottle which was icing on the cake!  Coke in the bottle goes down so good when you eat these amazing morsels of absolute goodness!!!"}
{"text":"The food her is great. I always order tacos and a torta. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Follow up review:  Still 5 stars for me.  By this time I've tried a variety of menu items and have never been disappointed.  Try their especial burrito - green chili/beans/potatoes - yum!  Tacos are always a good choice."}
{"text":"Awesome Food!! Always a sure bet for great Mexican food. Open late. Green chile our awesome!!"}
{"text":"Updated review (still the same):   Truly Horchata is the best and Tacos Al Pastor!  When I come its only on Tuesday nights due to their $1 Tacos! The al pastor tacos are cooked using the \"trompo\" method, which make it taste amazing!

I also always get at least one chicken taco because some days the chicken is really spicy how I like it and others not so much.  Now the al pastor tacos are always consistent.  The beans have also been consistent and truly taste like my mom's cooked beans!

There is a young man \"Abel,\"  who is real cool.  For the almost 20 times I have been here, I still have not gotten any bad service, so I am sorry for those that have not had the experience I have had. I recommend Tuesday nights!"}
{"text":"The food is great, and very flavorful but the customer service could be a bit better. 
I noticed that the prices on burritos went up a whole darn dollar! I wouldn't mind, but it's like the size has gotten so much smaller. Am I getting what I paid for??  Also, when I asked for jalapenos and carrots, she told me they were sold separately and couldn't be combined and 15 cents per one, yet when she gave me my bag of food I had a bag full of carrots, limes, and cucumber premixed. I'm confused?"}
{"text":"On our last visit we spent about $50 for 3 people which seems overpriced since it's more like a fast food restaurant. The food was decent, not worth what we paid for, I would normally rate this as three stars but I was very disappointed at the fact that there was a $2 fee for using my debit card! Most places usually change $.35 or $.50 but $2 is ridiculous!! If you come here, BRING CASH!"}
{"text":"Ok guys I think I have found the best street tacos in Phoenix..  I decided to stop and actually check them out since I've been dying to ever seen I saw the cool street art on the building while driving to work one day. I had a Asada taco and a marinated pork taco. The cashier told me the pork was probably the most popular on the menu. The food was great, the restaurant was very clean inside, and even at 9am this place was busy. The only reason I am giving four out of five stars is the cashier Didn't seem to interested in wanted to help and a little impatient answering my questions. She still handled herself professionally, but a smile and such really goes a long way. Also they only accept cash . They have a ATM inside, but it charges a $2 fee. So bring cash. I'll definitely be back and bring my friends, and hubby. There's always time for street tacos!"}
{"text":"New look same great taste!  I actually liked the old look, the building was unique and stood out. But hey, I came to eat not stare at the building.  Ha! The food here never fails!  Need a good lunch, a meal befor going out or somewhere after a car show (am I showing my age? Lol) this is your place!! If your counting calories, stop it and come do your mouth a favor! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The tacos became more skimpy now especially on Tues. Oh and the new cashiers are stupider than shit!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for great tacos de pastor (comparable to what you can find in Mexico border cities), then look no further.  They are muy, pero muy DELICIOSOS!  The menudo offered on the weekends is great as well (perfect hangover or cold remedy)!  This is one of the best grab & go spots in town or you could eat inside if you are not planning on staying very long as it is small and sometimes tends to get very crowded.  

Warning to those who are scared of sketchy neighborhoods.  You will probably be asked for change in the parking lot and you might run into a gangster or two.  :)  Just beware, the tacos are soo worth it!  

If you want a great burrito, a simple bean, cheese and carne asada will satisfy your craving.  

Would have given the place 5 stars but there is no inside bathroom and their horchata is not ALWAYS up to par (try the Jamaica drink, though).  Also, bring cash - there is a fee for paying with debit/credit card."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. But the cashier is always rude every single time we eat here. It's a good thing they got good food. I would come here alot more if it wasn't for the rude ass cashier."}
{"text":"I love this place their bean burritos are the bomb and their red cheese enchiladas are great we have been going here for a long time"}
{"text":"I've been enjoying this place since I was a kid I always get 4 taqueria and a carne asada burrito it is amazing i will bring my kids here if and when I have some lol"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years because the food is authentic Mexican street food and very good. I was glad when they remodeled the place a few years back 'cause the place was getting dumpy. It's always been a cash only place, so the reviews that complain about that apparently can't read the big signs on all the doors saying \"CASH ONLY\". So why only 4 stars? The cashier staff is horrible! The place is busy, but they have only one cashier? And that person has to take and give phone in orders. To top it off, the cashier is a young lady who's both overwhelmed and nonchalant. Often taking care off her personal matters when there's 5 or 6 parties in line. Management needs to put in another register and run them with better professionalism to get that 5th star."}
{"text":"Stopped by on my personal taco tour. After reading some hit or miss reviews decided to see for myself. I tried the asada, pastor, and tripa tacos. The asada tacos were tasty. The tripa was not cooked well enough for my liking. I prefer them crispy and not soft and chewy. The pastor was not bad either. Not a fan of the salsa, and the worst part in my opinion is the lemon. I have never seen an authentic taco served with lemon, always LIME!"}
{"text":"Not what it used to be I am sad to say. It seems that all good things do come to an end. The $2 charge for any card transactions do not help. The bad over priced tacos, the horrible seafood place across the street and the fact that's it on \"Van Burden\" is enough to keep me away for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Tripas in Phoenix! Great cabeza, carbè asada, and Pastor tacos tambien! If you stop by, I guarantee you will enjoy as they do not disappoint! #SUCIOZAPPROVED #SUCIOZDIVISION"}
{"text":"Came here to try out the tacos al pastor, a friend recommended them. I stopped in today and ordered 6 tacos al pastor a burrito and 6 other tacos. They were prepared quickly, I'm glad I checked the bag because 2 tacos were missing. I went back in and told the girl that 2 tacos were missing....she responded by asking me why...lol why?? I thought to myself...that's a damn good question..(not the smartest one of the bunch) I gave her my receipt and she checked everything. I got my tacos and left. I am giving this place 1 star because as a consumer I feel customer service should be #1 priority for the business and business owner. It clearly isn't for some people including this girl. It seemed like she didn't want to be there, if I was the owner I would reevaluate the employees. Get rid of the ones who dont want to be there and get some people who do. I know its not everyone's life dream to work in a taco shop but I have met some passionate people in the past that put 120% into all they do and it shows. Some past reviews have commented on the same issue....that was in 2015...c'mon B.O. If you need a payment processing system I know the right people who can hook you up. 
In conclusion I won't be coming back to this place. The food was good not great, another negative having to pay for every single miniscule thing. Which means your business must not be doing that great if you have to pinch every penny. I wish you and your business the best."}
{"text":"LOVED this place. Authentic al pastor tacos for $1.35 with quick and friendly service. I ate two and could have had three more. My homie got the chicken tacos and also said it was fire."}
{"text":"Yummy food, clean environment, amazing prices! Super friendly guy at the counter, owners brother I believe. He made suggestions and was helpful & welcoming! They have delicious pastor! Their red & green sauce was so flavorful with just the right amount of spice! If I didn't live in Los Angeles this would be my new spot! Can you guys deliver to SoCal?  ;)"}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST Mexican food I've had in Phoenix.

My wife loves their quesadillas and their tacos are my absolute favorite. You won't find a restaurant serving a more generous portioned asada soft taco for the price. 

I'm a customer for life!"}
