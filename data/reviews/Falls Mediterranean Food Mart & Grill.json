{"text":"EXCELLENT FALAFEL WRAPS 9/5/17 excellent stop for quick food after hiking. thank you!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Like others have said, the owners are very kind and will help you with any request. I haven't ordered food here yet, but have grocery shopped a couple of times. Definitely go if just to order dinner, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Falls Mediterranean Food Mart & Grill is the perfect place to stock up on a wide variety of Middle Eastern groceries.  It's also the perfect place to grab a quick, fresh bite!  First of all, the grocery store itself is very well organized, clean, and is curated with all of the products you could hope to find in a Middle Eastern grocery.  The Grill is allows you to enjoy a tasty sandwich on the go:  the falafel is freshly fried, and both the chicken and lamb shawarma are great.  Pro-tip: order a \"manoushe\".  You can also get a rotisserie chicken, Middle Eastern style!  The prices are fair, and the owners are very friendly, honest, and helpful.  It would be tough to feel disappointed with a trip to Falls!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place for middle eastern food. Growing up Lebanese my grandmother set the standard for tasty food. A few likes and dislikes from my visit here:

Pros:

1. Good spinach pies
2. Awesome shawarmas!
3. They offer to heat it up as you place your order
4. Grocery selection is good
5. The price is very reasonable for the food you get.
6. Pretty good hummus.

Cons:

1. They don't offer ground lamb in their meat pies
   - they're meat pies aren't great in general.
2. They tend to be a lot friendlier with middle eastern customers rather than others.
3. The zaatar bread seemed a bit old.

I would still recommend this place based on how good the shawarma was as well as the price. But if you're looking for lamb pies, go elsewhere.

I will be back to try the other things as well as buy another shawarma."}
{"text":"My boyfriend found this place when he fell into a Google hole looking for food around us. Boy, am I glad he did! Very yummy, fresh, authentic food is made here and we loved it. I got the vegetarian falafel plate (hummus, falafel, tabouli, veggie stuffed grape leaves, baba ghanouj and pita for dipping) and a chicken tawook skewer while boyfriend ordered the kibbie, stuffed grape leaves,a spinach pie, and hummus. It was my first experience with baba ghanouj and I LOVED it. Great on the pita and falafel, savory with a nice acidity. The hummus was very good too, and the falafel were great. Also loved the chicken tawook.. Would order all of these again. Boyfriend loved his kibbie and the hummus and baba ghanouj too!

The grape leaves were basically flavorless, and I wasn't a fan of the tabouli.. Boyfriend wasnt particularly impressed with his spinach pie, either. But that was pretty much the only downside that we had. The guys that ran the shop were friendly but seemed a little amused by us.. We were the only white people in there that I saw, though, so maybe that's why. Will definitely be coming back, though, and love that they sell everything we would need to make this stuff art home (prices are kind of hard to find, though)."}
{"text":"I recently moved from the Detroit area where I was spoiled with readily available and yummy middle Eastern food, so a short craving and a little yelp research later I went to Falls. After a brief survey of the overhanging menu I ordered a vegetarian platter and proceeded to walk around the grocery store and found my favorite tea ever, not super available in general and here it was (Sadaf-special earl grey blend)! Win number one :) by now my order is up--$9 for enough food for two dinners--ein number two! hummus, baba ganoush, grape leaves, tabouli, pita and 4 pieces of falafel. It was all delicious and fresh--even the olive oil drizzled on the hummus was an excellent quality. The baba ganoush was smoky and silky, the tabouli fresh and herby--I highly recommend this place. And let me also say, the staff was super nice and helpful, I will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"If your looking for a meat shawarma or a chicken sandwich, with a lebanese twist, this is the place to go to. 
Great friendly people and a clean place. Well kept and a great selection of groceries, from bread to the best meat."}
{"text":"Let me preface that you can expect great service and food here. I was welcomed immediately by the owner upon entering.  He had me sample a few things and was excited about me taking photos for Yelp. He told me they are expanding and will offer a seating area. He wants patrons to like what they eat so they can walk to the counter and order more. I ordered hummus (which doesn't normally come with pita) and a few others items just to sample for future orders. I can't recall everything,but I will return. It's worth it just to visit the uber friendly owner!

{"text":"Super cheap and super good! The beef shawarma wrap is flavorful and tender! The owners are really nice too! I would definitely recommend coming here for a quick cheap bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Great food! Grocery prices are common to other arabic stores, but the hot food really sets this place apart. The owners are courteous and the service is good. Glad theyre around!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service. My favorite is the beef shawerma, kibbeh, and their humus. 
It's a take out style, but it's phenomenonal."}
{"text":"I was just recently introduced to Falls Mediterranean from some Iranian grad-students that told me about Pacha, a meal they were making out of sheep's head and feet. I of course inquired where in the world around here one could get a sheep's head and they told me about this place.

I have drove past it many times before so I figured I would check it out. And man am I glad I did! The food here blows every other Mediterranean restaurant in the area (Aladdin's, Lyla's Taza, Sahara, etc) away! I ordered some shish kabab, tabouli, baba ganoush and falafel. And they were all fantastic. They were clearly all homemade and the flavors worked perfectly. 

The baba ganoush was a clear standout! It had that perfect, smokey flavor that most can't get without burning it. 

The food alone would easily give this place a 5-star rating but it get's even better! 

I asked them about this sheep's head soup and told them I was interested in making it. The head chef said he just happened to be making some that evening at home. He gave me his recipe and gave me suggestions on how to prepare it. So I bought a sheep's head and some feet and we'll see what I can do with it!

Everyone there was more than welcoming and very friendly The one chef even gave me and another person in the store a mini meat pie that he had just pulled out of their brick oven.

I will definitely be visiting often and this has now become by go-to Mediterranean food place!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today for some hummus & baba ganoush. The store is small, but has an excellent selection. Both the hummus & baba are amazing! I'm thinking I'll be shopping here on a weekly basis at least!"}
{"text":"I can find almost anything from Middle Easter groceries in this store and their prices are reasonable.

The store also offers ready to eat foods from Middle Eastern cuisine. However, I cannot find anything impressive in their menu. I tried their meat and chicken shawarma, grape leaves, meat and zahtar pies, kabab plates, but none of them impressed me. They simply do not know how to cook in a good way.

The store has well equipped restaurant style kitchen, but they cannot offer impressive food. I wish they could hire an experienced cook and start offering such food that would bring people for their food a few times week, but I am not hopeful at all.  

It is good to have a local store like that, but I wish they could run their cafeteria in a more professional way."}
{"text":"Great to-go food.  Very fresh. They alternate beef and chicken days. The tender meat reminds me of Turkish Donor Kabobs. Yum!
Big grocery selection."}
{"text":"Great selection of hard to find ingredients. Nice folks, helpful and will let you try some of their house made delicacies. 
The grape leaves are THE BEST!!
Now on my list of weekly stops."}
