{"text":"I hate these new Instagram dessert places where they put looks over taste. I got the Treasure Toast with sesame ice cream. It looked really good but the taste wasn't.

It was overpriced and the proportion are way too. Just way too much toast and not enough ice cream and other toppings. Toast was hard and cold. When I did have the ice cream with the toast it tasted good. Waitress was new an dwasnt properly trained.

I had a piece of my friends crepe cake and it was good."}
{"text":"Service is too slow. I ordered deep fried squid balls and it came out warm, not hot and crispy. The fruit grass jelly was the only item i liked out of everything i ordered. In terms of music, they really need to change it up instead of playing the same thing over and over. the sound came out of speaker was broken too."}
{"text":"Small but cozy. Tucked away down the stairs but once you get inside,  you will never know. Desserts look great. Friendly server."}
{"text":"Dropped by and got the Golden Sago which has pomelo and mango bits on top and my friend got the Mango Sago. Both of us found it had no taste except for the fruits on top. It just tasted like Sago in water with mango. The only part that made the dessert sweet was the mango pieces and there was not a lot of mango bits. 

The place is clean and the desserts look pretty but the Sago desserts lack in taste very much. Desserts are suppose to sweet somewhat at the least.... 

Will not return or recommend..."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The service is amazing. Their food presentation is on par with a 5 star restaurant. We had the coconut shrimp, which was actually amazing and definitely the best dish tonight even though everything was great. We got the sweet black sesame soup with soy bean pudding, which was good. We also got the curly fries, which had to be delayed because they had to make a fresh batch. To our surprise, they gave us mango crepe cake on the house to compensate for the short delay! The cake was surprisingly delicious. 

There's a 10% discount for their soft opening if you pay by cash, and their prices are not expensive at all (it came to around $15+tax). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here after a late dinner to enjoy some desserts. Was quite busy here and there isn't a whole lot of seating here as it's quite small and situated at the basement level of a business complex. I ordered the Golden Mango Sago which is a dessert they highly recommend. It has pomelo fruit pieces on this one. Pretty good refreshing dessert for $7. They put these desserts in quite the fancy bowl like the ones you see for drinking soups at high end restaurants which is quite interesting. Friendly staff here the desserts are reasonably priced. Overall, a pretty decent place for desserts. Would definitely come back and try some of their signature desserts."}
{"text":"I noticed luscious desserts passing by and decided to give it a try. They are still doing their soft opening, not sure when the grand opening will be. 

We got seated right away on a Friday evening and was offered water. We ordered two items: 

Black glutinous rice with sago and coconut milk - it was just the right sweetness. The rice came warmed against the cold coconut milk and sago which was a nice touch. The rice had good texture and was the perfect sweetness. 

House special grass jelly - the grass jelly was light and had good texture. The syrup that was on it was too sweet though. I think the syrup made the purple yams a bit too sweet as well. They gave a ton of yams, purple yams, taro, taro balls and red bean. The only thing I would change is the cook of the yams and taro balls were a little hard. I would have liked them a little softer. 

They had a good variety of options from sweet to savour and lots of drink options as well. I would definitely come again to try the other items!"}
{"text":"This is a very cozy dessert place. We ordered House Special Grass Jelly and Black glutinous rice with coconut milk. It was delicious. The desserts satisfied our eyes and stomachs. The place was clean and the service was pretty good. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place by accident while trying to find a dessert late at night and were we ever glad we did. It happened to be during their soft opening but they still had quite a few things to choose from on the menu. We got the Treasure Toast with Black sesame ice cream and it was THE BOMB. Best toast I've ever had in Toronto. The bread was crispy unlike some toasts which do a softer and chewier bread. The ice cream was really rich in flavour and there were a variety of fruits inside. There was a nice fruity flavoured honey that went over everything too. 
We also got the fruit tea which was the perfect finish - a refreshing blend of green tea, watermelon and apple slices. All in all definitely recommend and we'll be back to try some things from their savoury menu!"}
{"text":"One of the best asian dessert place in Toronto. A group of us went and tried out some of their dessert during their soft opening. 
We ordered Golden sago, Treasure toast, house special soy bean pudding, grass jelly with fresh fruit and the ferris wheel sampler. Out of everything we ordered my favourite has to be the treasure toast. The outside is nice and crispy, the inside is filled with fresh fruits, toasted bread cubes, drizzle of sweet honey and ice cream (we picked green tea and black sesame). Definitely recommend others to give this dessert place a try."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place during their Soft Opening. Thank goodness I did. I think this is gonna change the game of all Asian style dessert places. The owner did mention that since this is just a Soft Opening that they will be adding more items to the menu!! 

Curly fries: taste is fantastic, not oily at all and had a really nice crisp. 

Takoyaki: great taste, good amount of toppings and sauces, the batter was made well, it's hard to achieve a well rounded Takoyaki like they have. 

Coconut shrimp: omg this was perfect. The exterior was light and crispy, inside was fresh and the coconut taste is distinct without being over powering. Pairs nicely with the sauce. 

Fried fish ball: perfect. Good quality fish ball and you can taste the difference in comparison with competing restaurants. 

Curry mixed ball: good choice of brand for the balls, curry is amazing, sauce can be slightly thicker (just so it will stick to the ball and prevent me from drinking it out of the bowl) LOL. 

Mango pomelo sago: mmm soooo yummy, it will give the competitor a run for their money! 

Treasure Toast: The filling bread pieces were so good, I could taste that it was marinated in a sauce prior to cooking, fruit was fresh, and drizzled honey and condensed milk?  was really good complimented the bread well. You get 4 flavour choices for ice cream, I opted for Black Sesame, mmm yummy, best choice. The exterior was nice and toasty 

Overall presentation for the dishes were 100%, very elegant and classy looking, not like other places where they would plop the freshly fried items onto a bowl and give it to you like it was feeding time at the zoo. 

The sauce that comes with the appetizer items: define as a spicy mayo but it was so good and different, has a nice tang and spicy kick but not overpowering in any way, paired nicely will all apps that we ordered.

I'm excited to go back for Grand Opening with a finalized menu, will definitely be writing another review! So stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Quaint place in the heart of Chinatown. Their menu is limited but the price point is really great. 

Got the Ferris wheel sampler where you get 5 choices for $15.99. And also the taro sago. 
Sago was similar to other dessert places I've tried. 
Ferris wheel sampler came with three different sauces - spicy mango being my favourite. 

The wait staff was super friendly and provided some suggestions when we were stuck choosing. 
Would come back again for a late night snack."}
{"text":"Overall it was a good experience. Since the place has only been open for the past month, it's doing pretty well. I went late afternoon on a weekday and the atmosphere was nice. I had the fresh fruit green tea, mango Mille crepe and the takoyaki. For starters the fresh fruit green tea was sweetened beyond belief. There was too much syrup, however I am personally the type to drink my coffee and tea straight so this is a personal preference. It came in a pot and you had s cup which was nice. The desserts and food on the other hand was just delightful! Mille crepe wasn't too sweet and had a thin layer of mango jam in the middle and drizzled with mango sauce. It has a side of creme and other fresh fruits. As for the takoyaki, it was nice and crunch on the outside and I love the Japanese mayonnaise they used! Serviced was attentive, however this place is on the pricier end. The place is relatively small, less than a dozen tables and you can see into the kitchen."}
{"text":"New dessert place in Chinatown! The space is newly renovated and has a decent amount of seating in the back. The grass jelly with coconut milk with added taro and sweet potato ball was delicious. The taro balls were nice and chewy and everything tasted very refreshing. I regret not getting the house special grass jelly; for a few dollar more, it looks like you get a much bigger dessert. The plate that mine came in was big, but the actual dessert portion was quite small. Same for the golden sago. This one was not as good as the grass jelly. The sago was slightly overcooked, and there were very few pieces of mango that we had to fish from the bottom.

I also tried the curry fish balls. The fish balls had a denser texture compared to other ones I've had. Any fish flavor it would've had was covered up by the sauce, which is a thick glaze rather than light rub or soup. It was a little on the salty side. 

Over all, the presentation of each plate was really nice, but the taste is similar to what you would get elsewhere. If I come again, it will probably be with a group so that I can get the sampler wheel and sweet soup sampler."}
{"text":"Pros: server was nice, atmosphere was decent, very attentive water refills

Cons: the utensils were not clean whatsoever. I asked for a replacement but was given yet another dirty set. The food is subpar for the price but it looks decent appearance-wise. Menu is very limited although it is the soft opening menu.

Would not return"}
{"text":"Came here to try the Ferris Wheel Sampler. The design was cute but not very practical. The food wasn't that great. We ordered the deep fried fish ball, fried beef ball, fried lobster ball, fried squid ball and coconut shrimp. Everything felt under fried except the coconut shrimp. They just didn't have that crunch to it. The fish ball, lobster ball and squid ball also didn't have that springy bouncy consistency that we like. The texture was like squishy soft cakes.

We also tried the black sesame and walnut dessert. It was not sweet enough and the consistency was not really smooth. The texture was more grainy. 

Overall, don't feel like it's worth it as the food was not really good in our opinion."}
{"text":"They are sooo nice and accommodating. Dessert is bar none. Try the Nutella toast, it has a great flavor."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a mango sago for dessert which was OK - the pomelo on top was dry and the portion size was fairly small. They served lemon water which was nice!

The shop itself is nicely decorated and clean. There are tables large enough to become a study space.

Given the convenient location near the corner of Dundas and Spadina, I'll probably be back in the future to give it another go!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we went here for Valentine's day! It was such a cute & cozy place, the food was prepared fast and presented beautifully. The options on the menu were just enough for a quick dinner, but not too much so there's space for desserts. I didn't get to try their hallmark items (wheel sampler, treasure toast, etc) but I will definitely come back for them soon!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! It's a bit hidden as it's kind of downstairs, but definitely worth the visit. The interior is nice and cozy and clean.

Got the mango crepe cake and house special grass jelly. The presentation for both were good. The mango crepe cake was good, but nothing super special. The grass jelly was sooo satisfying though. It's 6.99 for a small but is a decent portion (shareable between two people) and is loaded with yummy toppings - taro and sweet potato balls, sweet potato, taro, and red beans. Everything was good except I feel like the taro could be cooked a little softer. 

Would definitely come back again!! :)"}
{"text":"The desserts here are legendary and magical!!! I never seen such desserts!! They are tasty and delicious as expected, but also as creative beyond your imaginations! The first time I saw the photos of their dishes I decided it a must-visit spot, and it definitely overwhelmed my expectations! The treasures toast and the house special grass jelly are literally no-doubt-must-eat! I couldn't even imagine someone would ever make such delicious desserts!! They just stole my heart!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the opening of Luscious desserts, we are now blessed to have a traditional Chinese dessert shop with a touch of modern flair without having to travel into Markham or Richmond Hill. Having lived in Hong Kong for numerous years, it has been extremely tough to find a Chinese dessert shop that meets the standards, and this gem certainly fills that void. I had their house special grass jelly which was delicious and not overly sweet. The biggest surprise was how well the medley of ingredients worked together; every bite was an adventure because of the different textures of each ingredient which made the dish very exciting to eat. My girlfriend had the golden sago and it was the best I've had in town. From the presentation to it's flavour, I could not find a spot of weakness. 

I would highly recommend this cute dessert shop to everybody. Its modern and soothing decor makes this shop a popular choice for dates or a hangout spot to catch up with friends."}
