{"text":"AMAZING Thank You!! Finally a good Pizza shop in the area.  I got the Buffalo Chicken pizza and went back the next day for another!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in because we were excited for a new pizza place in the Edgewater neighborhood! Ordered the Smokin' pizza and tossed salad. Pizza was delicious! The sweet peppers and pepper sauce was a nice contrast to the savory sausage. My only criticism was we could find the \"smokin'\" part (the flavors were not particularly spicy or smoky). Salad was your average pizza joint salad, but all of the ingredients were fresh. Also, they are open until 2 a.m. for late night pizza cravings. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a surprise to find this place on Clifton. This area doesn't have much by way of late night food so that is a positive in my book. My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place one night around midnight and decided to turn the car around and stop in. We ordered the arugula and mushroom pizzas. The mushroom had way too much sauce but was still good in flavor. The crust on this pizza is great! Orders only take a few minutes and you can be in and out of the store in about 10 minutes (well depending on how long it takes you to decide)."}
{"text":"Their pizzas are very good. Thin crust with proper amount of sauce. I definitely will come back for more !"}
{"text":"Every time I visit my Mom at the Lake Edge I make a point of stopping here for pizza. Their arugula pie is just like one of my favorites at a cafe in Miami I used to frequent in the days of yore. The light but chewy dough is perfect, and my pizzas have always been cooked perfectly. Love them. Recently tried their garlic parm wings and oh, the joy of a wing so crispy while yet so juicy it literally runs down your fingers? That is just the cherry on top people."}
{"text":"Come on... is this really all the basil you can afford to put on the Margherita pizza? 4 pieces?! This was very disappointing. Really wanted to make Project Pizza a regular on our take out rotation, but this was a rip off. The build- your-own Pizza for $10 might be the only way to order from here."}
{"text":"This in an awesome pizza shop!! The mad mushroom was delicious in every way! Myself and one other shared one pizza and wings and it was the perfect amount of food. The hot wings were amazing as well. Food was ready quick. Very nice employees."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! This food was amazing!! The ladies working there were so friendly and helpful. The pizza's are super great, and they don't even take long to cook!! We kept driving by and finally decide to give it a try. I guarantee you will love it."}
{"text":"Had an appointment in Lakewood today about five minutes from this place. Found this place on Yelp. The raving reviews and the pictures of beautiful pizzas got my attention so I decided to give it a try. I love wood fired pizza! Sadly, I didn't get to eat here. I am handicapped and there was no place to park. I circled around the block two times and thought maybe there was handicapped parking somewhere. Unfortunately there was not. I tried the parking lot right behind the building but it was for tenants ONLY and there were signs posted that violators would be towed. By the way, not an easy parking lot to get out of once you pull in. Don't do it! Perhaps if it wasn't pouring rain I could have parked down the street and got there in my wheelchair. Oh well, it was a disappointment. Can't say I'd go out of my way to go back to this place. I wish they were more handicapped accessible. Sorry."}
{"text":"Me and my wife were driving around our neighborhood looking for something different to eat. Low and behold we came across Project: Pizza. Upon entering this big beautiful oven caught my eye. I knew tight then that my pizza would taste as good as it looked. I ordered a large pizza and wings but I cant remember the type of pizza. It was really good and the wings were made to perfection."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  We got take out last week. One pizza with spinach, black olives, red pepper, and mushroom and one order of garlic knots.  The ingredients on the pizza were all fresh and well portioned. The crust is awesome, along with their red sauce.  The garlic knots were pretty good too, but the marinara sauce that comes with the knots was incredible.   On a side note, my wife made a mistake when ordering a couple weeks ago. We don't eat pork, and she forgot to say \"no prosciutto\" while ordering a specialty pizza. She told the staff when she got there, and they were very, very cool about it. They made her a new pizza without prosciutto, and were 100% professional and kind about it."}
{"text":"I thought a margarita pizza only have four ingredients, crust, sauce, cheese, and basil. Now, all of those ARE there but ummmmmmm 5 pieces of basil is ridiculous. Now I get if you're low on basil but then chop it up and make it last for as long as you can. It's very disappointing to see this. Wouldn't recommend this pizza if you want all the ingredients. Sad."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place hundreds of times and had no idea it existed. I found it via Yelp reviews. Project, you need a lighted sign :). We've ordered from here 3 times in the last month. Got the mushroom pizza, extra sauce, add sausage (amazing!!); arugula pizza, chicken alfredo pizza, and twice the wings. The wings garlic parm are way too greasy but they are very good size. Essentially, it's $1 per wing. They were fresh so on our most recent visit we tried the honey dijon wings. Very good! Same chicken, less butter/oil.  Prior to our first visit, we were hesitant to try because the concept is so similar to Pizza Fire (chain) and Pizza Whirl on W. 25th. After 3 visits, we highly recommend. The staff is great. The choice for toppings are enormous if and only $1 each to add one to a pizza.  Must try their marinara which they serve with the garlic knots; however, we got it to dip our pizza crust in. Excellent!  The only item we don't recommend are the salad dressings are not homemade. Definitely eat here!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience a while back with the older guy who works there bc he served other people before me though I was at the register first for a pick up order. I was pretty upset about it when it happened bc when I called him on it he got defensive. The other guy working apologized for him but bc of the more rude guy we won't be back. This is pretty close to where I live so we were pretty regularly visiting like at least every other week. I have since taken my pizza business to a place we love in Lakewood that is pricier but has stellar service."}
{"text":"Love that this place is within walking distance!  All the toppings for the pizzas are fresh and delicious. Love the thin crust. The pizzas are great size to share and have leftovers!  The wings are crispy and all the sauces are wonderful.   The garlic knots are so yummy!! The marina tastes like it was homemade that day.   Salads are great size and made to order.   I can't wait to keep going back to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and delicious fire oven taste. The crust is chewy and flavorful. The place is clean."}
