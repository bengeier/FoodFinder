{"text":"Very expensive raspados!!!! I had the vanilla and the flavor was good but they don't use the right ice. So it wasn't really like a raspado it was more like a vanilla drink. Idk lol. But that ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Good selection of crepes and other items. Food is good for sure. The wait time is ridiculous. I waited over 30 minutes for 2 crepes. I'm all for supporting local businesses but something has to be improved."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I tried the strawberry raspados and it was so good. My family loves it."}
{"text":"My daughter convinced me they had more than just raspados. Do they ever! I had a chicken crepe with fresh corn. It was topped with an incredibly tasty poblanos sause that made me want to lick the plate. We then had a srawberry cheese cake that was covered with fresh blackberries and raspberries and whipped cream on the side atop a crepe. My kids ordered two other crepes and the total  was a little over $20. Great food at great prices. I will be back."}
{"text":"Found this great new restaurant while looking on Yelp one day. Decided to try it with the kids - we loved everything we ordered! The Tosti Ceviche was to die for, tacos were delicious, bionico (fresh fruit with yogurt, granola & coconut) was a big hit, even with the kids! We also tried the magonada, coconut raspado (love!) and strawberry obispos (strawberry shaved ice with ice cream on top). We've already gone back a second time and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. The shaved ice items are overpriced. The taste is not that good. How can you mess up vanilla flavors? Well, they did! Not going back."}
{"text":"I'm shocked! This place is amazing. I hate to say this, but I saw the sign and thought usually raspados places are kinda gross. It's super clean laid back with great food and staff. I'm also pretty picky about my coffee, but they nailed it! I'm definitely coming back and often."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday to try it out and on yelp it says it was open but once I arrived around 2:30 or so workers were inside but door had signs blocking the walk-in. I than asked are you open and they said no not open till 3 ... long story short I did not get to try them out boooooo"}
{"text":"Just stopped by this place to order a tostielote & the lady dropped the ladle on the floor & continued to serve the corn with that same ladle! Needless to say I'll never be going back to this unsanitary place. Don't let the nice atmosphere fool you. Young girl was a bit rude also."}
{"text":"I am so excited that we have an AMAZING raspados place here in Laveen.  The owner is so amazing and she takes her time to explain and allow us to sample her delicious creations.  The raspado juice is home made and not this store bought syrups these other low quality raspado places sell.  The coconut and pineapple combination is so good.  The employees are amazing and take care of you so well.  This is the best spot to go to when you have a sweet tooth or want a delicious snack as well.  Check it out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"DONT GET A SMOOTHIE HERE
 This place doesnt even deserve 1 star! It was first time here, and i was excited to try the mango smoothie.  I love mango! I have had it many times in the past, and i know what mango tastes like. So, I asked what all is in the smoothie. I was told, mango and shaved ice. Hmm, that sou ds refreshing. I asked if anything else was in it. I was told no. So, I ordered the mango smoothie. Paid with a card, which btw they charge an extra $0.50! They put ice in my cup and took the cup to the back. Hmm, why do they have to make a smoothie in the back. So i looked in the back but could not see much. The cashier gave me the smoothie, and i tasted it as i walked out. What is this!!! Tasted like applesauce amd ice. Not mango! Even my daughter tasted it ans said it tasted like cinnamon. Who puts cinnamon in a mango smoothie? So i turned around and asked if applesauce was put in the smoothie. I was told no. So, what is in this smoothie?, I asked. Mango and ice. I said it doesnt taste like mango, amd i have had mango smoothies in the past. So, i asked for a refund, which they did give me begrudgingly.  Smoothies here are not worth your $4.50 plus $0.50 extra charge! Make it at home or go to a place you are familiar with."}
{"text":"Realy good Hot dogs and raspados recommend this place to any one. Very nice customer service."}
{"text":"Sweet Bites is an absolute gem! Wonderful atmosphere and wonderful people making delicious crapes and more!

Try the obispo with their homemade vanilla cream!!"}
{"text":"This place has to much going on and does not know a thing about raspados. They don't have the formula down they tried to do it their own way and it's just ice with fruit and a scoop of ice cream. No flavor. No taste. The fruit is sour. I order a crepe and Nutella and it was barley any Nutella and hardly any walnuts. They do have a variety of things to choose from but raspados should be a thing they shouldn't advertise."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now, so decided today was the day.  Soooooo glad I did!!!  I wasn't super hungry but wanted something sweet, tried the Nutella crepe, was yummy!!!!! Can't wait to try the ice cream and maybe the nachos next time.  I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very limited raspados flavors available, not so good either and crazy expensive, my son wife and i, over 40 dollars definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place! My favorites are the nutella crepe and caramel frapuccino. The establishment is clean and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious place for dessert or fresh coffees, lattes, espresso drinks! Crepes are huge with generous toppings! Took what we couldn't finish home for a breakfast treat! Been back for good coffee after having dinner nearby. Makes date night even more special! ;-)"}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB! Elote, Raspados. Crapes... w/ cheesecake, strawberries, Nutela and more. Do yourself a favor and stop here."}
{"text":"First time here and love it! Clean, friendly and delicious. Agree with other reviews that this is a hidden gem in the Laveen neighborhood."}
{"text":"What can I say, Even though this place is a bit hidden, its quite a hole in the wall. Let me start by saying that the overall decor of this place is amazing, from the Pallet benches to the reconstructed tables... WOW!!!
Then you move on the menu and can't decide with what to eat... why... because every option on the menu is mouth watering. They should make a sample platter. Of course,I'm always in the mood for something different from what's on the menu and man did they accommodate, I had one of those Durito tostadas but with Shrimp ceviche, an item may i add that is not on the menu, but they easily made. Then to top everything off I got a Sonoran hotdog and finished strong with a Nutella strawberry crepe. 
The Sonoran hotdog was bursting with Flavor, it was so big that i struggled for a minute on how to start. The Nutella Crepe was also delicious, it was proportionate and the ingredients were not lacking, I have had Crepes elsewhere and they are always inadequate, Well these Crepes were everything BUT that. 
Do yourself a favor and GO GO GO..."}
{"text":"Nice place, very friendly service and great food.  Tried the Sonoran Hot Dog, very good.  My wife tried one of the crepes and raspados, both looked great!  Authentic Mexican food and desserts."}
{"text":"This is my second time this week! I'm so happy this did not turn out to be another filibertos in the neighborhood. The restaurant has a nice Mordern/Rustic touch in the inside. Crepes are only $5 and they are freshly made and delicious. I loved my cappuccino. If you are in a rush this place might not be the right for you. They take a bit to bring the others out but the wait is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is slow, they are out of items constantly! And inconsistent ingredients on their snacks"}
{"text":"Great little addition to the South Mountain scene. Enjoyed desert here with the family recently. \"Nutella Supreme\" and \"Cheesecake\" Sweet Crepes were delicious. Son \"really liked\" the cotton candy ice cream. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been watching the progress and construction of this place over time since my fianc√©e gets her nails done at the place next door. Well last night I saw that it was finally open, so I decided to take a peak inside. The decor is clean, open, and modern. The workers were friendly and ready to answer any questions regarding the content and flavors of their products. I went basic and ordered a strawberry raspado which was delicious!! It had just the right amount of sweetness with the fresh strawberries, crunchy ice that wasn't like snow cone ice but provided texture, and a sweet crema that made for a perfectly balanced snack! If I had to put up a con it would be that debit card transactions cost an extra $0.50 to your tab because of the system they use. Not a deal breaker in any way but that extra money is less money I could be spending at their business. I will definitely be revisiting Sweet Bites though!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for long time I traveled far to get the elote in a cup my favorite but I guess there is another owner I felt as if a lot has changed and I went to buy some elote in the cup two servings which came up to $6.50 plus since I had a credit card they charged me $0.50 all together it came to $7.00 and I'm like it's not a meal but I really love the corn in the cup so whatever as they are making the cup of corn I mention if I can has cheese on the top and owner said that's a extra charge.To my self I said yeah this is the last time I'm going to eat here they have always put cheese everything on the top of the corn but now a sprinkle of cheese is a extra charge in the picture of the Elote it has cheese all over I'm just like is that a big charge to have that they have never charged me for a sprinkle of  cheese before ...I'm just really disappointed and they won't see me eat here again I miss just the old owner and the other employees"}
{"text":"Great service, and great food for the price. This is a gem in Laveen. Very cute atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"When you want a refreshing treat, give this  place a shot. Cute and modern decor. Will return for crepes"}
{"text":"The raspodo in Az. The customer service is beyond amazing. I felt very welcomed. Also all of there flavoring is natural!!! I promise this place in my opinion will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time on Thursday and I already can't wait to go back! I normally go to Fruitlicious on 35th & Southern but after they were closed during open hours, I decided that was the last straw so I tried Sweet Bites. Boy, am I happy I did! I bought 2 elote cups for my mother and I, and they were delicious! The decor inside is super upscale, and the girl who helped me was extremely friendly! The prices are also comparable to Fruitlicious, yet the customer service and professionalism is so much better. PLEASE support this local establishment! Will be back soon for another Sweet Bite!"}
{"text":"First raspados experience and it was delicious! We had the strawberry, the obispo, the diablito, and some crepes and a Sonora dog. I can't wait to try the whole menu!"}
{"text":"Second time here and we are in LOVEEEEEE! Good thing both my husband and I had a small dinner because I had a vanilla raspado(what I have been looking for since FOREVER) with strawberries, he had an Obispo (strawberry raspado with vanilla ice cream), we split a cup of elote, and our son had bubblegum ice cream. EVERYTHING is worth the 50 cent charge for card transactions! We will be back soon...chamoyadas will be 2 for $10 on Wednesday the whole month of August(forgot to ask if thats for regular $6 or large size $6.50).
The first time we visited my husband had vanilla ice cream with strawberries and I had a mangoneada! The first time I didnt see nor did I ask for vanilla raspado, they keep it in their extra fridge due to their limited space up front. EVERYTHING has been so far Delicious!"}
{"text":"The Tosti-ceviche is goood!!! Everyone should try it if you have a craving! Also the crepes were amazing. The lady helping me was so nice and made sure everything was good."}
{"text":"Delicious and such a cute spot to be. I ordered the fruit salad and it was wonderful and so big I couldn't even finish it. Will be back again and again. Paid $9.18 for the salad and it's nice that you can get a fresh treat for the price of a value meal."}
{"text":"Nice place to get raspados. Unlike most raspados spots, this one is clean, comfortable,  and actually big enough so you can sit down and enjoy the food. I got one with coconut, pineapple, and lechera. It was tasty, fresh, and not overly syrupy."}
{"text":"I came here based on the rave reviews of my mother. Great, inviting feel. Simple and modern decor. I was greeted immediately upon walking in and offered a variety of options. Since i was unfamiliar with their signature raspados, the young lady recommended the Nutella crepe (strawberry, banana, and walnuts). It looked amazing and it definitely did not disappoint. Next time I'll go back and try something else. Definitely a nice addition to the Laveen community!"}
{"text":"The crepes are amazing and the owners are so personable!!!!  My husband had the Nutella Supreme Crepe and I had the Strawberry Cheesecake."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place doesn't have a line out the door. Everything is fresh and made to order. The interior is adorable. We ordered 2 dessert crepes and a breakfast crepe. I'm still drooling over the Cheesecake Crepe and had an actual piece of cheesecake on top. The Bionico (sp?), has fresh fruit, condensed milk and coconut. I watched her cut up the fruit, so you know it's fresh. I've never had anything like it. So sweet and delicious. I inhaled the Sonoran hotdog. I want to go back for another. The bread was moist and soft. Literally melted in my mouth. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem located within Laveen. Calming ambience, with great hosts. Delicious food and an excellent place for breakfast!!  We will be back for sure."}
