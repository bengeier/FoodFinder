{"text":"my friends like to eat breakfast here, and come here quite often.  i had the crepes, and they were good.  everyone was pretty satisfied with their food, and the service was very friendly as well.  it's a nice neighborhood spot to grab some good eats."}

{"text":"This is an OK Italian restaurant in NDG. I  It's casual, and laid back with a fun atmosphere.There menu is extensive, but they seem to have a compact daily specials section which is nice.   I stuck to the daily specials and ordered a shellfish pasta dish. It was quite tasty, but nothing remarkable. As as plus, the portions here are HUGE. You get great value for the price."}
{"text":"Excellente cuisine italienne !  Beaucoup de choix, plat familial, pizza et pâtes ! Toujours un bel accueil et un bon service. Menu enfant très bien.  En famille ou en couple c'est toujours une belle sortie !"}
{"text":"Carmine's was once my restaurant of choice. Regardless of the meal ordered, everything that came out of the kitchen was fantastic!   Unfortunately, now it is under new management and the entire menu has changed to Chinese food. I was very disappointed to enter a restaurant categorized TUSCANY GRILL and find a complete Chinese menu. This is misrepresentation at its finest."}
{"text":"Carmines is a really generic suburban resto-bar in a strip mall. The food is vaguely Italian, but it's like they can't fully commit to being one type of restaurant. They serve salads and pasta and they also have a bar.  The food is forgettable. I don't remember how anything tastes, there was no single dish that really stood out.  I remember it being fairly pricy, though.   Honestly, I have no idea why people eat here. It's overpriced and really not particularly impressive.  Verdict:  Carmines sells edible, forgettable, surprisingly expensive food."}
{"text":"It used to be an Italian restaurant but I believe the owner sold it and it is now offering Asian cuisine. The name of the restaurant remains the same but it is altered to: Carmine's Fusion Style Resto et Bar (according to their Facebook page). But there were Chinese writings and I remember seeing the word \"grillade\" on the logo when I went this afternoon.  I went there with my family for their dimsum at around 1 pm and the restaurant was packed. There weren't any tables available so we were seated at the bar area. It was a bit weird to be seated there, especially for dimsum! But it was definitely a lot less noisy, which was turned out great.  The restaurant didn't have the typical dimsum chariots (this makes the restaurant cleaner and less noisy I think), so you have to order by looking at the menu (you put a check mark next to the dishes you want). The menu was in Chinese, English and French and next to the dishes, there were their respective sizes. The sizes determine the prices (it varied between $2 and $4, except for the rice/noodle). The menu was categorized into \"Steamed Dim Sum\", \"Deep Fried\", \"Rice rolls\", \"Desserts\" and \"Lunch Special/ Rice and Noodle\".   For the purpose of this review, I will just called them \"dimsum dishes\". So, we ordered a total of 9 dimsum dishes and one lunch special (fried rice noodle with sliced beef; very large portion!) and we were pretty full at the end.   I recommend their \"#4 Dumplings with shrimp and vegetable\" because it tasted better than the other dimsum places. Moreover, the portions were quite big too! Their \"#12 Bamboo rolls with pork in oyster sauce\" was delicious as well. It wasn't too salty and the flavour was very good. Their rice rolls had a really smooth texture, I recommend their \"#38 Steamed rice rolls\", this one was without filling but it came with two dippings: the typical seasoned soy sauce and peanut butter. I actually preferred the peanut butter dipping! Their \"#11 Spareribs with black bean sauce\" tasted very good as well (but nothing special compared to other dimsum places). But I liked how it wasn't full of fat, we actually got to eat the meat more than the fat!  Overall, I find they have a large variety and fine dimsum dishes, and clean presentations. But their fried rice noodle with sliced beef and deep fried dishes were way too oily. I had to wipe the extra oily out with a napkin and it was still very oily... Their \"#43 Special Malai roll\" was a bit too sweet too.."}
{"text":"I arrived in Montreal after a 'red eye' flight from Los Angeles, a bit disheveled and pretty tired. Staying with friends, I was locked out of their home after a cab ride from the airport. Stuck, I was getting pretty hungry, and took my suitcase for a walk through the neighborhood to find some lunch ( or with my jet lag, breakfast ). Carmine's.....Thank you. I was a bit stressed, and who walks into a restaurant with a suitcase. They made me feel right at home. Kind and prompt service, and oh yeah....the food....I don't even remember what I ordered, just that I left feeling very satisfied and relaxed. If I get to go back to Montreal, this place is on my list. Thanks Carmine's."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, Lemon Chicken is the best in the world. Many entrees available.Portions are always big. Kids meals are big enough for a 300 lbs man. Fresh Bread and oil given at start is awesome and I am sure you'll be going for seconds. Price is very reasonable. We did a private party there too...great service."}
