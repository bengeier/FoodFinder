{"text":"5-stars if you know what to order. This guy makes amazing soups and Rotis. I'm no vegetarian, but the veggie roti is killer! I worked in the area and ate here almost every day. Trust your eyes when looking at the options and you shouldn't be disappointed. And I recommend only ordering from the chalk \"specials\" board, not the other menu boards. 
And as mentioned in other reviews, this is a take-out sort of place. But 5-stars for the delicious soups and Rotis!! YUM!"}
{"text":"The owner is extremely  nice person, it was late & he was closing the store but when he saw I was hungry  he still gave me a HUGE chicken massala wrap with a good salad for a very good price. Conclusion - huge & tasty portions, cheap & the owner  is a very nice person"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch today. Very kind owner and wonderful food! Would not hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"As I said, best butter chicken roti in the business.  However, they don't have it on the weekend.  Myself and a colleague went there to get lunch for the office, and when they didn't have the BCR, he said he could make us regular chicken rotis.  What he neglected to mention is that he would have to prepare them from scratch (normally they have a crockpot with the filling pre-made).  We were waiting almost 20 minutes for the order which was not cool as we were busy in work and would never have ordered that if we knew how long it would take to make.  A heads up would have been appreciated."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices , and fast service . Check out the specials board for the best choices and best meals! You will love it !"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat at Queen East a month ago on my way home. Found this gem, which offered a great variety of good Indian vegetarian dishes. I  had to dismiss that time, as they take cash only.

Well, few days ago we made it there with cash prepared and all. That day they didn't have many vegetarian options, but something to choose from anyway. If you like fish, they have some wonderful Basa fish there marinated and grilled...yummy. 

At 3 PM place was empty, just the guy and TV playing World Cup - Mexico vs. Brazil!

We decided to have spinach with rice and fresh salad. Since we most of the times share the portions, we ordered one and paid $7 for it. We ate in and therefore the guy brought us nice plate and real utensils, not the plastic ones. Food was beautifully presented (unfortunately didn't take a photo as was so hungry). Spinach was good and so was salad and the rice. By the way, very healthy choice, as in salad there were some beets as well. Yayyy! While eating the guy offered us and extra rice, I think because he saw us eating from the same plate :) Abundance!

We shared the plate and we were both so full, that after a 15 minute walk we even couldn't fit in a shortbread cookie from St. John's Bakery.

Lovely place with a great variety of foods and salads for every taste. Highly recommended, grab your take-away bag and enjoy out in the grass!"}
{"text":"This isn't the type of place you'd plan to eat at, you just eat there because it's the only thing available. I will give this deli credit for being the best of the 3 available on the block. I recommend the Chicken Caesar Wrap or daily Chicken Specials."}
{"text":"This is a good place to pickup an amazing full course lunch/dinner for not much money. Can't get enough of the Indian food, especially the rotis."}
{"text":"We've eaten here hundreds of times, my work colleagues and I, over years. The guy who runs this place excels at making fantastic, affordable food. Curries, stews, casseroles, burritos, wraps, salads, all of it delicious.  

He may not have a warm and friendly manner, but he is a very decent man, and when it comes to making a large quantity of great food at reasonable prices, he is a master. 

A rare gem in Toronto."}
{"text":"There are three restaurants right next to each other, and I must say this is the worst of the three. They are the only one of the three that are open on Saturday and Sunday which is why I was forced to eat there even though I was not impressed by the service when I walked in. For a small \"mom and pop\" style deli, it is the furthest thing from it. Both the cashier and the person making the food act like it is an inconvenience that you are making them work.

While possibly a good deli during the week, the weekends are pretty much useless for them as they don't have any deli meats available. In fact, from their menu they only have their \"specials\" available (or so I was told) which consisted of a couple breakfast items, a cheeseburger, and a couple wraps. I opted for the cheeseburger with home fries and found out later that I was probably better off just getting a bag of chips for lunch. The burger was a nice size, but it was too undercooked to fully enjoy. I do like my steak rare, but a burger just should not be made that way. As if that wasn't bad enough, the home fries were basically just chunks of potato and were also under cooked. They were a slimy mess on the outside and semi-hard on the inside even though heated throughout. Just to make matters a little worse, I was given 6 packets of ketchup for my single scoop of home fries, but not a fork in sight.

Not trying the River Towne Deli during the week I can't comment on how their food is. And not having anything else that sounds like a good lunch to me on their weekend menu, they are pretty much useless and only make weekend business because they are the only thing open. I do see people in there during the week, so I assume they must have something decent, just not from what I have seen in my experience..."}
{"text":"Diminutive deli serving the local lunch crowd. Daily specials are posted on a sandwich board and offer variety to a mind boggling degree. The diverse menu includes sandwiches, wraps, curries, chili, pub fare, and pastas. Pretty decent selections and they accept debit. Not a lot of room to sit, with a few seats inside and a single table outside in the summer. Better for take out.

Obligatory Title Pun: Go to TOWNE in this deli!

Menu Readability: Sandwich board features misspellings aplenty, but it gets the point across.

Need to mention: Do not get the Mexican meat pie under any circumstances.

What this place teaches me about myself: Just because you can't spell, doesn't mean you can't make a mean avocado chicken wrap."}
{"text":"The customer service is deplorable. I feel like the people behind the counter could care less about me enjoying my lunch from their restaurant. They didn't hand me my change, they set it on the counter for me to gather up and walked away without a thank you.

The only thing good about this place is their french fries."}
