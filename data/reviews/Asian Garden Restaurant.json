{"text":"I've gotten food from here at least 50 times over the years. The few different dishes that I always alternate between are absolutely amazing. The one dish that sets them apart though is the general tao chicken. Best I've ever had anywhere and I often eat too much of it even though I'm full. I just can't resist the taste and the portion is very generous."}
{"text":"I love their general's chicken, it's my all time favourite :) I would highly recommend it. The restaurant focuses more on providing great food more than anything else. However, this restaurant doesn't have an enormous selection of vegetarian foods. Nonetheless, I would say this is one of the better Chinese restaurants in brampton."}
{"text":"This is now the place that my wife and I order from.  We have tried other chinese food places, this place wins.  I would recommend this place.
They use real crab meat in their dishes, not the imitation crab meat.  For someone that enjoys food and likes quality, this is a big deal."}
