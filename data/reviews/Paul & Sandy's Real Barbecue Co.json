{"text":"We order the sample platter for 2, and it was way too much food. Perhaps we are not accustomed to eating BBQ in such quantities, but we hardly made a dent. The variety was very good to sample each of the meats that are offered, as well as two sides. Meats included full rack of ribs, brisket, pulled pork, meat loaf and chicken. We started with the ribs, and while  happy with the portion, I must say that I was disappointed in the meat itself. I'm not sure if they were baby back ribs, but they tasted more like side ribs, and were kind of dry. I am not a BBQ expert, so maybe real BBQ ribs are not supposed to be moist, but if juicy is wrong, then I don't want to be right! The rest of the platter was decent. The sides were probably my favorite part of the meal. We got fries, coleslaw and potato salad. I love sides in general, and all of the sides were excellent. The fries were crispy but not overly crunchy, the coleslaw was creamy and sour, but not too creamy, and the potato salad, topped with some paprika, was one of the best that I've had. There are also two bottles of house BBQ sauce on the table that you can add to your meats; I dumped it in massive amounts all over. The spicy one is pretty good, with some kick but not overbearing. I didn't not try the mild one.   There are two parts of the meal that are my focus: the sides (as mentioned above), and condiments, including any sauces or little extras that add to the meal. Many times, I can even forgo the main. In this case, I could definitely go back just for the sides and call it a meal."}
{"text":"A big thanks to trusty Christine for her heads-up on this little treasure in Etobicoke.   The \"Real Barbecue\" in the name is for real yelpers. Here there's none of the usual desiccated meat slathered in some way too-sweet sauce that so often passes for Q in Toronto. To my experience, this sets the new standard for authentic smokey Southern goodness. Go and experience how Paul skillfully tends to his products and achieves wonderful outcomes."}
{"text":"I'm lucky enough to be in the neighbourhood often, and when I am I make sure I pop by for a big lunch. You can't beat any of their staples, but for me it's all about the beef brisket.   Try the jalapeno cornbread. You won't be disappointed.   The best part, it's run by a family, so you'll always be sure to get good service."}
{"text":"I've went several times and every time has been so good. Prices are in line with the competition and the food is very tasty. It feels like I'm in the States eating delicious pulled pork! Well done and pls keep it going, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ. Lots of food and not pricey. A place you can go back to, and the food is good."}
{"text":"Nice people, excellent food, GREAT root beer.  My Wife and I have been several times and our faves are the pulled chicken, the brisket, and of course the platter.  It's great to have a place in Etobicoke with reliable delicious food."}
{"text":"Horrible service here, absolutely disgusting.  My burger was soggy and tasteless.  Lost my appetitie coming here."}
{"text":"The first step I took into this place my stomach was calling out for food. The smell of the BBQ was calling to me immediately. I knew at that point it would be great.   My cousin is here from England and was craving ribs so I \"yelped\" this place and boy did they deliver.  Unfortunately we came a bit late as Sandy had just sold the last of the ribs but we were delighted with the selection of sandwiches. From Beef Brisket to Back Bacon Hamburgers. Let's not forget JALAPEÑO CORN BREAD......YES...LET ME SAY IT AGAIN....JALAPEÑO CORN BREAD!  The fries were amazing. The brisket was amazing. The back bacon burger was amazing. It was a delightful meal and I will be back very soon. FOOD 10/10  Sandy (the owner) served us and she was very nice and made sure we were taken care of. CUSTOMER SERVICE 10/10  There were 3 of us and we had 3 sandwiches with fries/cornbread and 3 soft drinks....the bill $30?! I thought the math was off but it was for real. PRICE 11/10!  Let's just say that I will be back for my ribs and anything else that I didnt get to try.  P.S: The mints that they give you after your meal are addictive! LOL!  THANKS FOR AN AMAZING MEAL PAUL & SANDY :)"}
{"text":"Is this the best BBQ spot in Etobicoke? Maybe. I have no idea. I arrived hoping to get a full rack of ribs and a whole smoked chicken to go. They tell me that the smoked chicken as to be ordered in advance (2 days or so I'm told). This is not mentioned on the website. I figured okay, I'll get 2 racks of ribs instead. I am then informed that I can get 1 rack of ribs to go, but not 2. They didn't say, \"sorry, we only have one rack left\", I just got a straight \"No\".Where is the logic in that? Why would 1 rack of ribs be do-able, but two becomes impossible? Does it not fit in a container? Then cut it in half and put it in two. Not wanting to spend anymore of my time trying to figure out this place, I just left. It did smell good inside though."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff. I had the pulled pork sandwich which was unbelievably flavourful!  Will definitely be coming back for more next time I'm in the area. Prices were fair and the place has a real home-cooked feeling to it with the owners actually running the place"}
{"text":"Whenever the weekend's here and I have a hankering for BBQ, it's off to Paul & Sandy's for some neighbourhood charm and great cooking.  We have been numerous times and never disappointed!  With only a few tables, there is sometimes a short wait but it's worth it.  Each of the mains are superb and portions are generous - I'm always a sucker for the 2 meats and sides but would go home satisfied with just one meat.  How to choose though?  The Jalapeno Cornbread goes quickly but always delights.  Grab it if you can."}
{"text":"I just moved into the area and I tried this place for the first time in late November. I've been back a few times. The staff are great and very friendly. I've ordered the chicken and I've ordered the ribs. First off the chicken falls off the bone. It isn't dry and has a great BBQ flavour. The ribs are exactly what you'd expect, perfect. The half rack of ribs had a lot of meat and was worth it's price. It's my favourite place to eat at in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Have only tried the pulled pork and potatoe salad so far..but the best I have ever had! Very clean operation, great prices!"}
{"text":"I love this place, everything is fresh and delicious. Small portions are made on purpose, so they keep tables full all day and nothings wasted, show up early. Try the Smoked Chicken, smoked peameal bacon and Monterey Jack sandwich with jalapeno cornbread."}
{"text":"I know they closed today but They deserve a review anyways. Live in the area, and like many many others sad to see them go. Amazing all around at BBQ, I've had tons of BBQ in my life and this place was at the top. It bothers me that reviews bring the rating down saying they ran out of stuff, if you really wanted something call ahead because cooking protein especially large amounts being smoked takes a certain amount of time, is expensive, and as someone who knows about the culinary field especially smoking I can tell you it's not an easy process. Anyways the product they delivered, and the service was always grade A. Hope they open up a new place in the future, they said maybe just a takeout place or a food truck. So if they do I want to give them another great review for their future endeavours. Will miss you Paul and Sandy."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the ribs here, absolutely delish! The house made smoky BBQ sauce is the boss. Can't wait to go back for more ribs!"}
{"text":"Been trying to get to this place for a while but it's closed on Sunday and Mondays which are key dine out days for me.  Ask any my friends and They will tell you I'm the biggest barbecue buff they know.  I have traveled to a tonne of different barbecue restaurants around town and this place is definitely worth the visit.  This is real barbecue folks. The kind that people in Memphis Nashville Kentucky would be proud of.  It's nice to see that there are still some restaurants where the owners work there I was lucky enough to meet Sandy on the way in and was delighted to try the amazing pulled pork with its awesome Kansas City style sauce.  definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I have gone here numerous times with family and friends. We always got the meat sampler and the appetizer sampler. For the meats, there brisket is the best and they really know how to cook it well. After I would say there pulled pork is great. There ribs are okay, nothing special and every other meat such as the chicken and meat loaf were good. The appetizers I enjoyed were the mozza sticks that were big and filled with alot of cheese. The chicken bites were good and onion rings were massive. I would avoid the zucchini sticks as they are just thin slices of deep fried zucchini that dont taste that good, and the jalapeno poppers were average. The customer service is good and for the price, what you get is pretty generous. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Terrific spot...was there a couple of weeks ago and we had a great 30 minute chat with the owner.....great guy !  Seems that an ' undercover team ' from Toronto Life magazine was there at the same time as we were to sample the pulled pork etc.. They took a lot of pics of the food they'd ordered - and by all accounts, they loved their meal.:)  Went there over the weekend again and 4 of us sampled the brisket sandwich, pulled pork dinner, chicken and full rack of ribs - the ribs were ( hands down ) the best ribs I've ever had !!!!!!  If you want authentic BBQ...it doesn't get any better than Paul and Sandy's !!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant when I got lost in Etobicoke.  Since then, I have \"gotten lost in Etobicoke\" quite a few times!  Their pulled pork sandwich with fries is second-to-none.  The sandwich is consistently a juicy, dripping, delicious mess.  I've also tried their beef brisket sandwich and pulled chicken sandwich as well.  Both exceeded my expectations.  Service was quick but friendly.  Prices are unbeatable.  Portions are large.  Great value and always a delicious meal.    TIP: Parking on Dundas is free after 6pm"}
{"text":"Fantastic.   I went here with my wife for lunch today and we were both thrilled. Ribs were great, brisket and pulled pork sandwich were great, potato salad was excellent. Quality was very good and portion size was giant. Given the price, this was a steal. Service was excellent and Sandy was sweet as can be.  We'll be regulars starting today.  Hooray for good BBQ in Etobicoke!"}
{"text":"So I finally had a chance to stop by this restaurant in the heart of Etobicoke after reading several Yelp reviews about this place..  It was well worth the trip!  I had the beef brisket which had a nice smoky flavour and was tender.  I also tried the pulled pork with was juicy and had a nice taste to it as well.  The portions were generous.  I especially liked the corn bread (try the ones with jalapeno).   The coleslaw was a nice compliment to the meal."}
{"text":"We've been reading a lot of reviews for this place lately, so we decided to go check it out. It doesn't disappoint!  We both decided on the 2 meat dinners, I picked brisket and chicken and my boyfriend picked brisket & pulled pork. Really, really tasty with just the right amount of smokiness. Mmmm. The servings are more than adequate (we ended up taking some home with us) and the price is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Found this place on the internet, looking for something different than the usual burgers, read a few reviews and we were intrigued.  Showed up at 1 pm, parked just down the road at the Goodwill and walked in.  There was 2 tables open and we were greeted by Sandy and led to a table at the back.  Checked out the menu and opted for the platter for 2.  Now I'm not a big fan of pulled pork or beef brisket as I've always found these to be tough and stringy.......imagine my shock (Shock, i tell you) when I was able to cut the brisket with my fork!!  Then, the pulled pork was melt in your mouth soft!!  Absolutely Amazing!!  There was way too much food for two of us to finish so we ended up with a take out container for dinner that night!  Only complaint (hey, this is a review, not an homage) would be the slaw was a little bland, but a little salt fixed that.  This was our first visit (and they say you never forget your first) but we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Really. But I didn't. Sadly, we do better ribs at home (and yes, my partner and a good friend of ours do one mean BBQ.)  A tip we've gotten was to order the sampler so you can try everything. And sampler we got. We also ordered the jalapeno corn bread, which was also supposed to be fantastic.  The good, the sampler was overflowing. The sampler for 2 was enough to feed a family of 4. And it looked and smelled awesome. But sadly, the ribs were not \"fall of the bone\" and was very dry and the meatloaf was very bland. The silver lining was the beef brisket, but it was just OK and not outstanding. And the jalapeno cornbread - dry and again nothing special.  We noticed a lot of regulars come in and leave with containers of takeout. So maybe we ordered the wrong thing or they were having a bad night? In any case, we're not going back. Sandy (yes, The Sandy) was gracious and charming but not enough to make us want to try it again."}
{"text":"Great place. Tried a little but of everything and nothing disappointed. Pulled pork and chicken were tender and flavorful. Brisket was decent, but other items over shadowed it. Meat loaf was a pleasant surprise. Corn bread was slightly dry, but when paired with the sauce made in house it was pleasent (sauce was good enough to grab some to take home- the hot, which wasn't nearly as hot as I enjoy but not the painful sweet you often find). I suggest pairing with a long island, recommended by Sandy. It did not disappoint."}
{"text":"They are wonderful people, but I had pemeal  bacon on a bun, and the sauce ruined it! I wanted to return it, but it was take-out, and I was so hungry , I just are it! Lmao"}
{"text":"Meats were cooked to perferction, moist and tender. Excellent portions. The smoke flavour was just noticeable, I would have prefered more smoke. The few variety of sauces were decent, but not overpowering. Sides were good  Definately real BBQ!  Closer to a shade under 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended and didn't disappoint!  The first thing you notice when you walk in is the wonderful smell of wood smoke and BBQ.  The next thing you notice is the friendly staff.  The owners, Paul and Sandy, take real pride in their restaurant (which they started as a labour of love in their retirement years) and it shows in the quality of the food and service, which are both outstanding.  I will be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"We ordered a piece of jalapeño and regular corn bread and the sampler platter for two (beans and fries as sides).  Everything was delicious! I definitely recommend the beans, ribs, smoked chicken, and pulled pork. You won't be disappointed. We will definitely be back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I forgot how good the food here is.  We stopped by for an early dinner and almost had the place to ourselves. I ordered the two meat plate which includes your choice of either brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken, or barbeque meatloaf, your choice of two sides and garlic bread.  I had the pulled chicken and brisket.  Their brisket is sooooo good it should be a criminal.  The baked beans are yummy, but runny, so be careful or you are gonna be wearing them home.  The fries are fresh cut with skin on and tasty.  Do order their Corn Bread,  You get two huge thick slices for a $1.75.  The Jalapeno ones are the tastiest!  All in all I gotta say iscome hungry and go home saying, OINK OINK OINK!!!"}
{"text":"When there's smoke.... there's BBQ!  The second you walk in, all you smell is burning hickory and the sweet smell of BBQ.  We walked in at 7:55pm. They announced that they close at 8:00pm.  My face fell with disappointment and despair! But they said that we could still do take out!  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, half a rack of ribs, and the jalapeno cornbread for $18.  That's a great price for a whole lot of BBQ.  If you dine in you get free slaw.  Next time, I want slaw for my sandwich.  The pulled pork sandwich was HUGE.  Soft, tender, chunks of meat, I took my extra sauce and loaded it on.  I needed a fork to eat my sandwich.  The ribs were incredibly fall-away-from-bone-tender and juicy and oh-so-smokey!  You can really taste the hickory.  The corn bread was freaking good, sweet with a hint of spiciness.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had the sampler. Everything was bland and flavourless.  Waitress asked how everything was, I said average and she walked away and hid for the rest of the meal. The amount of water that came out of the pulled pork, makes me think they are freezing and reheating. This is bad bbq folks. Even the sauce on the table has been watered down. They made no attempt to address the crap food they serve. Never again. I would suggest making the trek to Stockyards if you are craving bbq. Or there is a great place in kitchener. Sad because Toronto needs more bbq. Dont eat here."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. Amazing. Pulled pork was delicious and the portions were huge. Price was good too. I will defiantly be going back soon."}
{"text":"A great place for authentic bbq.  Living in little italy, we don't get out here all that often. However, when we crave real bbq, this is where we head. It's all extremely affordable, filling, and super tasty.  My favorite is the pulled pork and pulled chicken. Super tasty and very tender. A great way to try the bbq is one of their sampler platters. There is so much food you will definitely be taking some home, but bbq heats up well, so this is a definite bonus in my book!  The only weak spot in my opinion is the bbq sauce. It's good, but it's not quite 5 stars worth. It needs some more bottom to give it a more full richness, but I'm also an extremely picky person when it comes to bbq. My husband likes it just fine :)  overall, great place, friendly owners, worth the trek."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!  Go early because they can run out nowadays with their growing popularity. Fav's include the meatloaf sammich and the pulled pork. Ribs and fries are amazing.  Great family run business. Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"This is more of a \"Good 3 star\" place.  Thought I would love this place.  Just looks so homey, mom'n'pop kinda place.  Turns out it's just \"good\", homecooked, well-priced BBQ.  Not Amazing.  Sandy is a really nice lady, likes to talk to her customers, very friendly.    As for the food, I've had the ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and cheeseburger here.  Everything was pretty good, but I've had alot better ribs elsewhere (swiss chalet shhhh).  I find they never put enough sauce in their sandwiches, and the jalapeno cornbread is really dry.  I do really like the pulled pork sandwich, just ask for extra sauce.  The burger was good, but they do use processed cheese :("}
{"text":"I just finished wolfing down a full rack of baby backs, pulled pork sandwich, & fries. The owner's are quite friendly and they ask for feedback.  It's great to see owners who are interested in what people think of their food.  Would I go back?  Yes mam."}
{"text":"Must get the BEEF BRISKET SANDWICH!  This is the best thing on their menu.  They give plenty of thick cut slices of brisket in the sandwich.  When I order the plate , they give long thin slices.   Check out the photo of the brisket sandwich.   http://www.flickr.com/photos/soulconcept/8533216888/  Also try their spicy BBQ sauce if you like the heat :)"}
{"text":"I live pretty much across the street from this place and go there a couple of times a month.   Great food. Very friendly service. Super affordable.  For about $10, I get a half rack of ribs and two sides (my favorites are BBQ beans and jalapeño corn bread). The jalapeño corn bread is phenomenal.   Really good pulled pork sandwiches also. Generously stuffed with meat and topped off with BBQ sauce.   Food is fresh and depending on when you come during the day you might not have the entire menu to choose from.   If you eat food not just when you're hungry, you've gotta try this.   The second best BBQ joint I've ever tried (my favourite is Bobby Q's in Phoenix, Arizona).  9/10."}
{"text":"Hey,  came here from an article I read.  Was in neighbourhood at lunchtime and popped in. I had the brisket on a sandwich.  Very well done.  My buddy got the hickory chicken.  I liked the smoke on that one.  Both great.  If I had to mention anything not great it would be the bun.  It's ok.  It's plain ad could use elevating.  Otherwise, service great, de or is average.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Their BBQ food is great if you're there at the right time.  Don't go too early or too late or you will be disappointing.  When it's fresh out of the smoker/grill the food is wonderful.  But it's like going to a backyard BBQ, if you're not there at the right time there won't be anything to eat.  I shared the platter numerous times with friends and it is the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"You know the meal is hearty and good when you are happyily trundling out of the establishment with enough leftover and a sigh of peace.  How can a tiny place pack so much food?  I came here and shared a platter with my friend.  It was unbelievably good, meaty and en point on all scores.  I think my favourite was the brisket, followed closely by the ribs, then pulled pork and smoked chicken.  The sides are wonderfully complimentary and the service is warm and inviting especially since you actually see Paul and Sandy walking about taking pride in their establishment.  This is consistently good if you need a BBQ fix.  Don't go anywhere else.  If you are hankering for finger-lickin good ribs just go straight here, no stopping at those \"other\" bbq chains."}
{"text":"In short, a great place for BBQ in Etobicoke.  Fatty, greasy, moist comfort food for a good price.   After getting a traffic ticket, my natural coping mechanism (eating) kicked in.  Having bookmarked Paul & Sandy's based on the great Yelp reviews I made the short trip to Paul & Sandy's for lunch.   The only thing I've tried here so far is the pulled pork sandwich, and it's pretty good.  Most of the pork was moist and soft, though there were a few chunks of drier meat, enough that I had to pour some extra BBQ sauce onto the sandwich.  Overall it was good and definitely one of the better ones in Toronto.   The baked beans were  good, they had a distinctive flavor (there's some bacon in there) and a bit of a kick to it.   I'm a pretty big eater but a single sandwich with beans on the side (about $8 after tax) had me feeling comfortable and I had (nearly) forgotten about my traffic ticket.  There's actually a small parking lot in the back, so you might want to check that out before you park on the street.  I'll definitely be back, and next time I'm going to try the beef brisket which looked realllllllly good.  I'll be sure to update my review after my next visit."}
{"text":"Solid spot if your in the neighberhood and looking for bbq. We got the platter to try everything which was good but by the end was just a carnivorous pile of mess. Ribs were solid as well as the pulled pork. A sandwich might be the best way to go with some fries which were delish."}
{"text":"the staff was very friendly, the BBQ was good not great there are much better places for BBQ in the city"}
{"text":"Live close by great brisket,ribs pulled pork onion rings big portions peak hours busy . I usually go for late lunch. Only thing I didn't like chicken and haven't had bacon when I went they did not have any Street parking New item Porktine huge portion loved it"}
{"text":"So very very sad to find out that this place just closed down at the end of November 2014. It really had excellent food!"}
{"text":"Look for the \"Sampson Academy\" sign because the \"Paul & Sandy\" Red sign can be so easily overlooked right underneath. Side-street parking but Sunday is Free, however because of the side-street parking their is a bit of bottleneck driving here. Drive patiently because it's all about low and SLOW!   I was here early Sunday afternoon so the back-of-house LCD wasn't even turned on yet. Greeted warmly and sat near the front. Wine and Beers are offered here but no house-made Lemonades or Iced Teas. The decor is minimal Southern Jazz but has a slight Swiss Chalet feel.   BBQ Sampler Platter for 1 (Pulled Pork, Beef Brisket, Baby Back Ribs, BBQ Chicken, BBQ Meat Loaf - $23.95) came with choice of 2 sides. Pulled Pork, Beef Brisket, Baby Back Ribs, BBQ Chicken can all be summarized together by saying smokey, juicy, moist. Any Meat Loaf is hard to use juicy as the description but was pretty good like a big Meatball with smokey.   It was definitely a MEATFEST enough for 1 enormously hungry individual or 2 average couples. All the Meats showed some smokey outside crust while specifically the Meat Loaf and Ribs were sauced more so. Blistering Hot or Premium Hickey BBQ Sauce were given to the table where Blistering is necessary as the juice of the Meats mellow it as you eat.   Paul's BBQ Baked Beans, I can't say I'm expert enough to notice any difference to others. Be glad I'm not a big Baked Beans fan or else this place would smell GASY rather than smokey. The Creamy Cole Slaw wasn't all that great as it tasted like Packaged Slaw and a slight letdown compared to everything I had. Even the complimentary Buttered Bread starter was nice.  Btw, the TIP % on the Merchant Terminal uses the value Tax-in but the difference is really in the Pennies.  You can do Value entry rather than Percentage otherwise Cash is always good but I only had $5.00 with me as usual.    :P"}
{"text":"A friend and I went here last Saturday night for dinner.   Ok, let's get the bad out of the way: they ran out of food on us.  There were no baked beans, no cornbread and no brisket and NO RIBS.  I can appreciate only making enough and not wasting but other reviews, at other sites, cite this problem too.  This is a restaurant that clearly has not taken the time and energy to figure out some of the basics.  Beyond that, I cannot say that customer service was tops here--we were not checked in on by wait staff until the end of the meal and it took forever for our order to be taken.  (Based on the table behind us, it is clear that regular customers get better service).    Now for the good: the pulled pork, smoked chicken and meat loaf were all excellent.  The coleslaw was some of the best I've had in a long time and I could eat about 100 of those pickles.  (The bread and fries were fine, not particularly good or bad).  The value was terrific--and you can count on taking some home if you order a platter.  I don't think I would return as there are other BBQ joints in the city, BBQ joints that DO NOT run out of ribs on Saturday night during dinner.  But, I would recommend this place, especially if you are nearby.  Just get here early if you want to make sure you can get anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Great review Christine. I have been here a couple of times so far and agree its the real deal. I have had the pulled Pork, Brisket, meatloaf, beans and coleslaw. I thought that they were all fist rate"}
{"text":"Awesome food in a nice part of the West End in Etobicoke.  This BBQ temple comes complete with the fragrance of incense (hickory smoke), offerings of rich dark slabs of pork ribs, and a respect of tradition in the corn bread.  Prices are reasonable and the quality is excellent."}
{"text":"what a cute little neighborhood \"dive\"!! bbq is delish as well as sauce french fries hand cut with peels and fried just right!  very small and a little unorganized, but that makes it a  find!!"}
{"text":"Took the wife and kids for lunch. By far the best Pulled Pork Sandwhich in the entire GTA amazing portions. All I got to say fantastic place to eat."}
{"text":"I see a pig.  I see the word barbecue.  I slam on my breaks, pull over, roll down the window of my car and inhale deeply.  Yup, that's smoke I smell and where there's smoke there is usually meat.  I don't get this though because I pretty much know every eatery on Dundas between Jane Street and Sherway Gardens.  There ain't no bbq to be had along this strip so when the hell did this place suddenly appear?  You can't get much by this meat diva.  I gotta check this out.    Paul & Sandy's Real Barbecue Co. has been open officially now for 18 days.  So on my way home from work yesterday I hauled ass into this newly opened small eatery to see if they really had bbq worth lugging all the way back to Caledon.  It's a small place and yes there really is a Paul and Sandy, who are a middle aged married couple whose love for bbq (every 'cue king has his/her story of how they followed their dream of  being a real smoker) and this couple have theirs.    All of this aside, for me it comes down to the meat.  I'm a 'cue snob, without question.  The bar is high when one inhales the smoke up at the Stockyards or over at Phil's or along College St. for some hard core smoked brisket at Caplansky's.  I'm thinking to myself these two better be bringing their 'smokin mojo or get the eff outta Dodge City.  So I order the take out to lug home and let my ever loving, meat chuffing, rib sucking, beef gnawing man of a husband have a go at this with me.  Just like so many other smokin joints P&S's have run out of a few things.  Ok, so it's like the Stockyards.  Ya snooze, ya lose.  I asked for pulled pork on a bun and am told that the pork is done but they have the \"bark\" bits if I'd like.  I love crispy outter bits of pork so I go for it.  I also order the brisket on a bun, a half rack of ribs (lucky me, only a couple racks left), an order of hand cut fries and a small tub of homemade red skinned potato salad.  Cost of the order $28 bucks.  Wow, so far, a bbq bargain.    Ok, I'll admit.  I'm surprised.  The beef brisket is juicy, pink and hand cut.  The pork \"bark\" is absolutely delicious and considering they are the outter crispy bits it is still tender meat.  I'm really happy to say that they don't use those big frisbee, foam core buns.  These sandwiches are a bargain ($4.50-$5.25) packed with a solid 8 ounces of well smoked, sweet to the edge, lip licking meat.  The ribs are fall off the bone good, have good smoke flavour, fill my schnoz with the smell of smoke and in my opinion are the biggest bargain on the menu at $14.25 for a full slab (compared to the $25 up at Stockyard's or Phil's).    I'm a tater hater here though which is a stab in my heart because spuds are nothing but manna to me.  The fries were soggy and not cooked thoroughly.  However the potatoes are fresh cut so there is hope for Paul & Sandy to get their frying skills in order and improve the spuds.  If you are going to sell potato salad as red skinned then you might want to make sure you are actually using red skinned potatoes.  The potato salad, while actually quite tasty is way to heavy on the mayo concoction.  They should try The Swan's potato salad because those guys have it right.    I am always amazed that in a risky business such as restaurants, neophytes, with absolutely no resto or food management background take the quantum leap of faith and try their hand at this.  I think Paul and Sandy can smoke up some great eating but they need to invest a bit of time and effort into creating some atmosphere and for gawd sakes lose that loser looking menu.  The counter is disorganized.  Dad is cooking.  Mom is trying to help.  Daughter is also trying her best but at least these are personable people and small talk ensues as food is prepped.    BBQ is hip!  BBQ is hot!  Their look is not.  A shame this is because P&S Barbecue Co. sits in a fairly affluent hood and they could really create a niche for themselves since there is no one within eyesight of any smoke signals serving delicious 'cue like this.    Dennis hummed at me and gave me a thumb's up with a mouthful of meat.  He aint' a guy you can blow smoke up the ass of easily so if he say's it's good eatin...it's good eatin.  Here's hoping Paul & Sandy work out the hiccups."}
{"text":"food was excellent, really enjoyed it! but..  spent about $50 for 2 adult/2 kid take out; NOT CHEAP.. felt it was over priced and slow.. really nice staff."}
{"text":"Pulled pork is good. Nice, friendly place in a cool neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday...after wanting to stop in for over a year or so based on what I had read here and on other sites and social media. Had the two meat platter of brisket and pulled pork with BBQ beans and cole slaw...thinking the slaw was needed to add some raw veg to the meaty mix. Added an order of jalapeno corn bread added just because I knew I would want it with the leftovers.  Service was cheerful and considerate. Folks were getting their food quite  quickly even with the relatively large menu.  Everything was just delicious...brisket was very tender and moist with just the right amount of smoke and bark. Pulled pork was nice and chunky...hot and very tender. Two sauces were provided...one hot and one bourbon, both were great. I alternated back and forth...and made sure to douse the take home containers when the leftovers were piled in. You so want to be my lunch today!"}
{"text":"The BBQ here is awesome, lots of choices, everything done just right.  My GF and I had meatloaf, chicken, ribs and pulled pork, with garlic bread, perogies and corn bread. Nice little neighbourhood place that kicks chain restaurants to the curb.  A gem in Etobicoke, check it out.  Only negative is somewhat limited seating.  I've been here several times now and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several BBQ restaurants in the US and this is how this place compares   Restaurant appearance 8 - Very good clean   Service 5 - Nice people but service could be quicker. Would not recommend for lunch.   Food Quality 7 - This is the only BBQ eatery I have seen in T.O. I have tried their sample platter which has all the meats they serve. (Brisket, Pulled Pork, Ribs, Meatloaf, Chicken and Ribs). I would recommend the pulled pork or Ribs, Meatloaf was good also, I found the Brisket dry and tough and chicken is chicken (Portuguese style I prefer). The baked beans and fries were pretty good also.   Value for the money 6 - Average price per person $15"}
{"text":"I went for a drive yesterday and discovered that Paul & Sandy's was sadly gone. Great food and a wonderful atmosphere. The owners and staff were  incredible and it was great and quick. A big loss!  I also drove by Marky's  and Sparky's and saw they have closed . Sad news on both fronts for BBQ lovers west of Roncy!!  On a completely different note Jay Jay's at 4th and Lakeshore have re-branded themselves as a BBQ joint. Apparently the rodent population was a bit out of control. Now in one spot you can eat BBQ groundhog, get a lap dance and take your lady for a night of swinging action. Single men are welcome after 12;30!!  Please create a nice smokehouse in New Toronto. Woody's Burgers is great but it's not quite it."}
{"text":"If you want good bbq in Toronto, you've got few choices. If you want mediocre to bad bbq, you've got plenty of choices. Paul & Sandy's has the goods for good bbq. I had the pulled pork and brisket combo with beans and slaw. I asked for \"moist\" (fatty) brisket with sauce on the side, and Paul obliged me with some moist, non-sauced brisket. The pulled pork was tasty, but definitely needed the sauce. The brisket could go either way w/ the addition of s&p or the sauce. The beans were tasty with a little something extra, and the slaw is the creamy type, with a good crunch and again, that something extra. My wife had the pulled chicken which was moist, smokey and tasty with the added sauce. The garlic bread is a nice touch, but a little odd since I'm used to cornbread, but I'm not complaining cuz I like garlic bread. Portions are good and you'll leave full."}
{"text":"Excellent Barbecue, worth the drive. Tried it all. Pulled Pork, Meat loaf, Chicken it's all great. Jalapeno cornbread (homemade), Baked Beans (bacon and Bourbon)  Creamy Coleslaw, all old skool.  Great prices, small family run business.  Get their early as they start closing around 7:30 What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing. What a great time. The food was great. Service amazing and the root beer wow! A definite prize."}
{"text":"Being from the southern us I've had some good bbq. This place is really good. I had the brisket and smoked meatloaf with jalapeno cornbread . It all was great. Pierogies were good also.nice helpful staff."}
{"text":"The service was friendly but a bit slow and the sides were just OK, but you go to a BBQ joint for the meat.  And the meat was good.  Pulled pork was the best I've had, ribs were really good, even the chicken - which I wouldn't usually even order at a BBQ place - was awesome.  The brisket was fine but not outstanding, cooked just right but a bit flavorless for my taste.   If the service were a bit quicker (I've only been once, could have been bad luck) and they got a beer or two on tap (bottles only for now), I'd give them a 5."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of meat/bbq places, and this is newly one of my favourites. We got the 2 person platter and added on a third person. A total of 30 bucks or so. Basically all you can eat meat. The platter consisted of ribs, brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken and meatloaf: all of which were smoked. Will go through one at a time.  Ribs: Amazing ribs, they passed the 'peel right off the bone' test. As far as taste goes, they were pretty damn epic. They were probably the best thing in the platter.   Brisket: A bit dry, but very tender. I'm not much of a brisket person, but it was pretty tasty. Combined with their homemade bbq sauce on the table, it was pretty damn good.  Pulled Chicken: I've never had pulled chicken before, I wasn't wow-ed by it or anything. There wasn't too much chicken flavour, and it was very dry. It tasted mostly of smoke (smoked chicken is very hard to do... you need to imbue it with more than one flavour, otherwise the smoke dominates like this did. That's why beer can chicken is very popular.). Again, adding the homemade bbq sauce remedied things.  Pulled Pork: Very dry, but very tasty. I wasn't wow-ed by this either, but it was good still.  Meat Loaf: This was amazing. It came with a gravy that was just wicked. It wasn't dry at all, and had a ton of flavour.  Generally everything was tasty (except the chicken), and a bit on the dry side except for the ribs/meatloaf which came with gravy. BBQ sauce made everything better. All in all a good, friendly BBQ joint that I will be frequenting more often."}
{"text":"I stumbled apon this place and it was literally right under my nose for who knows how long before I ever knew it even existed!  Excellent food and good service, nice portions and prices with a pretty large selection on the menu.  No parking available except for street parking, but I park a little ways up the street in the large Goodwill parking lot or the lot behind the shopping complex itself. Overall delicious food! Melt in your mouth Beef brisket and cornbread... mmmmm  I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice and have left happy, but not enthralled. I find the service lacking and the staff not very attentive. They didn't check in while we were eating and never asked if we wanted more drinks.   The food is good, but not the best barbeques in town by a long shot. The brisket is very tender, but tasted old. The ribs... Omg the ribs! So delicious, but again seemed a bit old (the tops were a bit dry and almost crunchy). Not sure if that is what they are going for though. But that being said, I would eat them again and again.  All in all a decent experience. I would go back."}
{"text":"Maybe 2.5*, but I've definitely had better bbq elsewhere  (Holy Smokez) and have made better pulled chicken/pork, minus the smoke, in my slow cooker!  Reception:  Icy.  Absolutely NO estimation of time or acknowledgment for patrons who are standing at the door, waiting for seats.  Younger waitress looked like she was trying her best to ignore the steady stream of people coming in.  I had to ask for a menu to look at while we waited.  Only menu was posted outside the door.  Looking back, we should've left, but I have been looking forward to coming here for soo long and the smell of the smoke kept me there.  While waiting, we heard the waitress tell customers, who were just seated, that they had ran out of certain items.  From reading the other reviews, I guess they haven't resolved this issue yet.  Not good.  After ~30mins, we were finally seated, still without any sort of acknowledgment.  I asked about whether or not 2 people can split the 2 meat platter that came with a bunch of sides.  The young waitress (Eastern European?) curtly says that they'd have to charge us an extra $6.50 if we do that.  No further explanation of whether or not that extra money gets us a larger portion.  I wasn't in the mood to argue, so I just left it and we ordered separate platters with 1 meat ($11.95ea).  The waitress goes on to tell us what sides we can order, so I choose my sides (1 not from her list, but on menu), and she repeats her list again in a condescending fashion.  How am I supposed to know that they DIDN'T have the items that she didn't mention?  Food:  Fairly large portions.  For the Beef Brisket there were 4 slabs with more than half the plate covered in fries.  Brisket was soft, I didn't have to press too hard with my knife to cut it.  However, aside from the nice smoke, EVERYTHING was bland, even the potato salad/coleslaw.  For the first time, I had to reach over and use the salt shaker on fries.  They looked to be hand-cut, but weren't seasoned which made it difficult to eat.  Pulled Chicken was slightly tastier, but it was doused in sauce.  I also reached over for the BBQ sauces to use on the Brisket and they also lacked sweetness/saltiness.  To top it off, they were both watery.  The ketchup/Frank's probably had the most flavour on the table!  While eating, I observed the younger waitress and one of the owners (Sandy?) tell people waiting that they ran out of food.  Lotsa people left.  The younger waitress has to work on her pleasantries/manners or get shorter shifts, she wasn't friendly at all and had lotsa attitude.  Verdict?  Overrated, definitely NOT worth the wait.  Food wasn't tasty enough to put up with that attitude.  Sandy (??) appeared to be warmer, friendlier, but she never came to our table.   They hafta work on a system to deal with their small, 8-table restaurant Vs. steady stream of patrons coming in, some kinda system to acknowledge customers, and their lack of food."}
{"text":"The food here was really good but the service was somewhere between not-great and bad.   The good: - Pulled pork is excellent - Cameron's in bottles for $4 - GREAT fries; Some of the best I've ever had - Really excellent BBQ sauce, hot and spicy or regular - Inexpensive (other than the unbelievable $6 sharing surcharge)  The bad: - Took forever to get the food (30m for fries and a sandwich) - I was standing at the cash register wanting to pay and the owner actually made someone else's bill [manually! with a pen and paper and a calculator and looked up the prices on the menu...] and delivered it while I was standing there waiting instead of processing my transaction - Waitress not friendly, owner not friendly - no one smiled at me, asked how the meal was, said thanks for coming, acknowledged my presence in any way whatsoever other than the bare minimum of taking my order and delivering my food  I'll probably come back here because the food was SO GOOD but I don't expect to be tipping next time if the experience is the same. I hate the social more of gratuities. I was happy to pay for the food I consumed here (it was amazing) but I resent being expected to tip for service like this.   A note to the family that owns this place... if you are gong to continue to expect a gratuity from me, I am going to require that you provide service that is at least as good as a TTC collector or a Tim Horton's drive-thru. Really, I am going to need you to UP your game to this very, very minimum standard."}
{"text":"I give them 4 stars for their wonderful beef brisket and baked beans! Pulled pork is all right too, as well as the coleslaw and corn bread. However, I wouldn't recommend the baby back ribs and meatloaf, and I wish their barbecue sauce was thicker and more flavourful. I live nearby and I often come by for take out. Service is always friendly and efficient, even on busy weekends."}
{"text":"The second that I stepped into this aromatic restaurant I knew that I was in for a treat. Taking a peak at the patrons around us munching on their tightly packed sandwiches, I opted for the beef brisket sandwich. After a torturous 15 minute wait for the food as we endured the mouth-watering smell, the food arrived. The first bite into the food was overwhelming. My taste buds were overjoyed as the juicy 24-hour marinated, slow cooked brisket blended perfectly with the crisp bun. The amount of meat was generous, balanced with a reasonable amount of fat, and goes nicely with their own homemade hickory smoked BBQ sauce. The fries were also delightful, not too overcooked or too stale. I'm a big eater, but after finishing the meal, I was glad I only ordered a regular sized sandwich.  The price is very acceptable: the sandwich was only $8, with a choice of side and a pickle. I also had their homemade soup, which was entirely hearty, for about $3. The total came out to be around $12. Their service may seem unfriendly at first, but that's because they are a family run business with only three people running the entire operation in the restaurant, so it is understandable that they are a bit tired. Once you have a conversation with them, you find that they are very amiable folks, passionate about their food.  Overall, I would recommend this place to all meat-lovers, sandwich lovers, BBQ lovers, and generally, food lovers!"}
{"text":"Bit disappointing that we showed up later in the evening and they were out of a few things (understandable with how they cook though) what we did get was great though. The service was great, the food was awesome. Would stop in again if i'm over that way (and the prices were really reasonable as well)."}
{"text":"Great little place! Really good bang for your buck.  I've tried the pull pork, brisket and meat loaf, all very good. They have multiple sauce choices. The amount of food for the price you pay is what puts them over the top!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. After reading several reports of lousy service i have to say that this is not the case at all!   Both times i was in after the supper rush and both times the waitress sat me and my party down with a friendly demeanor and welcomed us to the place.   The food came quick and she checked on us often. Everyone loved the food and the second time I even made up my own custom sandwich attempting a few substitution due to some of the food having had run out.  All food was excellent and plentiful with very reasonable prices. I can personally vouch for the onion rings, ribs, pulled chicken, pulled pork, jalapeño cornbread, and brisket. WARNING the jalapeño cornbread has a bigger kick than expected!"}
{"text":"2 yums wayyy up. The food is deeelish. I had the beef brisket and it was melt in your mouth great. Staff is friendly and Sandy is the best!!"}
{"text":"If you ever thought you had tasted the best ribs or pulled pork, or just pure smoked meat, then clearly the name of the place must be Paul and Sandy's. The only two reasons for not going there are that either you are a vegetarian, or you live too far away. The place smelled heavenly with that hickory smoked essence that wisps through the air. I entered the establishment after reading reviews and was quickly seated and given a menu to look through. I didn't need it, I knew what I wanted, it was the pulled pork sandwich. My gastronomic inner self was giggling excitedly from looking at other tables and seeing the meat being cooked. It wasn't a long wait, and when I saw that sandwich with the shortbread, my jaw literally dropped. Out came my phone to snap a picture and post it to make my friends jealous, with my tongue already licking my lips. I took a bite into the food and was taken to a world beyond this dimension, the flavours, the texture, the smell and the temperature all co-existing beautifully. I don't normally finish all my food because of a small stomach, but that day, my stomach probably cut a hole in the adjacent liver to make way for it to expand. I ate the whole thing, along with the crumbly and excellent corn bread, wiping the plate as clean as a surgeon's hands. I was thoroughly satisfied, and vowed to bring all the meat lovers I knew to this place. The cherry on the cake was the very reasonable price, only $10 for the meal and a drink! I tipped heavily for the insanely good food and great service, well worth it."}
