{"text":"The really friendly and nice owner/manager, unfortunately, can't make up for mediocre food. I ordered the fried fish (4 piece perch) dinner and fried mushrooms. They use a cornmeal batter for both which is just not that good. Give me a good, light beer batter any day, or even better a light tempura batter. Besides the batter, the perch and mushrooms were just meh, I'm sorry to say. Perhaps soul food is just not my thing, although I do love me some Southern fried chicken and waffles or country fried steak from time to time."}
{"text":"Impossible to review. I ordered a half white with hot sauce on top. They put BBQ sauce on instead, and I didn't find out til I got home. Harold's with hot sauce is Incredible. With BBQ sauce, it is Terrible. I tried wiping it off, but the fries and bread were already ruined, and I couldn't get rid of the awful, sickly sweet, generic store brand tasting BBQ sauce taste. I can't even tell you if the chicken was cooked well b/c Harolds is all about the Combination of chicken, hot sauce, fries, grease and bread.  This was inedible. 

I've eaten Hundreds of times at different Harolds' in Chicago, and have been missing it since I moved here. I was very excited to see they opened one here, and imagine driving the whole way home anticipating a great Harolds meal and being So disappointed. I'll try again, and check the sauce before I leave, but this one is their fault, so they get a one.

Other Items:

They use Wonder WHEAT bread on bottom, not White.
The breast is medium sized - not scrawny like the South Loop location, but smaller than a Good Harolds.
There is no portrait of Harold in the store. 
They have a drink fountain, not a soda machine.

********UPDATE**********

I have eaten several times here since my last visit, and it has been much better than my first visit. It is now the equivalent of the Halstead Harolds - not quite the 183rd and Kedzie level, but way above the South Loop."}
{"text":"I'm glad this place has gotten some good reviews, because the people who work there were very nice and the place was put together well.  I hope them the best.

Unfortunately I was disappointed.  I got some fried mushrooms, and the catfish and chicken combo.  The food was of good quality, but it was bland. Really bland.  Because of that I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Second time here just had to try it again, it's one of those places, I have to scratch my head ; wondering what the fuss is all about.
             First time had the fried chix w/ the mild sauce ,the sauce tasted like ketchup. I'm not complaining , because it's the way I eat my fried chix anyway, but call it a sauce , please. This time I had the hot sauce figuring it was spicy ketchup, wrong it was, well hot sauce from the bottle . It was hard to eat  , like eating hot wings w/o the blue cheese dressing.  I had the half chicken combo ,all dark meat 2 thighs and 2 drumsticks it came with a little container of cole slaw and a fair amount of fries. There was a little wait because they cook to order. The chicken is alright , your basic fried chix , nothing special. 
                    Popeye's here I come!!"}
{"text":"I looked up this place for the fried gizzards and fried mushrroms. However i found it to be so much more. Great people working there and a very very clean place. The nice man that helped us behind the counter came out and cheacked on us a number of time. If you want a nice good downhome lunch with some nice good old downhome food this is your place."}
{"text":"Popped in to pick up some dinner on the way home. I got the 3 Piece Chicken Strips and Fries special. When I got home (about a mile away) and dug in, my fries were already soggy. They may have been served up that way, seeing as there wasn't much time for them to get soggy in transit. 

I ordered my food \"Chicago-Style\" which meant \"covered in sauce\"; I also went for the hot sauce (after living in the South, I'm accustomed to all things hot). The strips were delicious and the breading was incredible! Albeit soggy, the fries covered in hot sauce were still good. Dunking them in buttermilk ranch probably helped. It was too much food for me to eat in one go-round, but it was all very good.

I didn't try the coleslaw because I hate cabbage, so I can't comment on that.

I'll be going back to this place to try the fried mushrooms and okra soon. All in all, good food at good prices with a friendly staff! Way better than KFC, Popeyes, Canes, etc."}
{"text":"I'm a life-long afficianado of chicken and fish. Originally from Kansas City and now in Las Vegas, I grew up with an amazing amount of choices of great local KC chicken restaurants. Today, my good friend is in visiting from Phoenix. He's also a native of KC. We went to Harold's on recommendation and he had gizzards and wings and I had livers and wings. I live on the far east side of the valley near Sunset Mountain, so it was a bit of a drive to Harolds. We didn't try the food until we returned to my house and we both quickly realized that our food was drowning in salt. If it wasn't so far, I would return the food and demand a refund. I LOVE fried chicken. This (based on my first and last visit) is the worst that I've ever had. They do a booming biz. Maybe it's a favorite of smokers that can no longer taste their food? My local Popeyes shames their food and costs much less.
Good luck."}
{"text":"24 chicken wings. 6 fried catfish. A bunch of fried mushrooms. Done done and done!!!

Not your KFC or Popeyes. You can tell this place has a secret family recipe (the lady who rings you up is from Chicago and is super nice...she calls all of her customers \"Baby\"). The taste and texture is something else!

Off the strip quite a ways but consider this recovery fried chicken after a night or nights of binge drinking and early mornings in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The Chicken and the Perch were good, I recently visited Chicago and the food at the Harolds on 87th and the Dan Ryan was much tastier. I will be returning to my local Harolds again though."}
{"text":"Chicago has a huger influence on Vegas than most people notice. I honestly think that California is the only place that has more Vegas transplants.
While I grew up in Vegas I was a Chicago baby and my family would always tell me about this place called Harold's Chicken shack. The fact that they would open up one in Vegas is so random, but I digress. 
The chicken is pretty delicious, better than KFC, but not as good as Popeye's. Fries were a bit bland but add some salt and they're fine. 
Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation. Decided to up the ante by taking people with. A bucket of wings (not my fave part of the chicken, but I digress), and those absolutely mouth watering fried mushrooms put me in place. The place is a delight. The fry is light, but good. It reminded me of the Simpsons episode where they turned Moe's into a TGIF and Homer fried everything. I would eat my own fist if it was lightly breaded and fried at Harold's. And the nice lady at the counter would make me feel like it was A-OK."}
{"text":"Im glad we mentioned Yelp to the nice lady working here. I asked do you know what Yelp is? She goes no, whats that? And so me and the gf explained... long story short, we mention Yelp and we get a free shimp and fries basket along with our order and free drinks! OK, on to the next one...

As soon we walked in, its super clean! Really spacious with couches and tables spread throughout the open floor.  and 2 big screen TV's to watch while waiting for the food.  They had alot to choose from the menu.  But when i go to  a new southern cooking style restaurant... AHEM, excuse me, chicago style cooking, i gotta try the wings, and so i did.  they came out really hot! It was good, but it wasnt that good.  Maybe its just me, but the wings were just a LITTLE TOO moist, maybe if they kept the wings in the fryer a little longer they wouldve been perfect.  I noticed all the orders had 2 pieces of wheat bread beneath all the food.  Gotta have something healthy with it, right? 

Portions are really big here.  If you eat here for lunch, you'll have enough leftovers for dinner. The hot sauce is bomb, not spicy but with a little kick.  

It's ALL FRIED EVERYTHING but sometimes you just wanna eat some good crunchy greasy goodness!  This is definitely a good alternative to the spot i go to in the bay area."}
{"text":"Place is CLOSED.  

After going to school in Chicago, was hoping to get some Harold's, but its closed."}
{"text":"\"If there's such a thing as \"food for thought\" then it's close cousin must be the \"food for the soul\".\" - Aljamin Santos (c)

We dress our Sunday's best every Sunday to Church because we want to be presentable to a Higher Power. Whether or not you believe in such as a Higher Power aka God, we will find common grounds in Harold's Chicken and Fish. Tracy at HC&F's beliefs are parallel and very evident that she believes in dressing the great food served here in it's best and highly presentable in her very new location on West Cheyenne. Barely a Las Vegas local, Tracy came here about a month and half ago from Southside Chicago taking along with her the deep and fresh tastes from Chicago with her version of Chicago's soul food! Don't be fooled-- the other Harold's are owned by different folks!

A few of my friends and I planned to get sandwiches, but when we were waiting to turn into the plaza, my gf mentioned that HC&F has a sign saying \"NOW OPEN\". I honked at my brother and with all my knowledge of sign language, I frantically tried to signal him to look at HC&F's sign! Little did Tracy know, that the reputation of HC&F precedes them and we've been waiting for them to open for quite a bit of time already. We walked in and started to take in the place. The entire restaurant is likened to a very large dining room with 2 flat screen televisions, sofas, chairs, plenty of tables, and jazz decor. The menu is self-explanatory but if you have questions, Tracy would be very happy to answer them. When we walked up, I asked what \"perch\" was. I've never heard of it and Tracy was so kind and generous to give me an explanation and offer a sample for me to try it! That's hospitality! :)

After we ordered, we sat for no more than 7 minutes until our food arrived. We were the only customers, but 7 minutes for all the food we ordered came out to us brought by Tracy herself in pretty good time! We ordered the catfish and dark meat chicken combo. The combo came with 3 catfish filets, 1 leg, 1 drumstick and some fries. It didn't come with a drink though. That'd be nice if it did :) The catfish was fried in a corn meal kind of crust and had just the right amount of that fish-y taste and flakiness. Tasty, indeed! The fried chicken wasn't very different, but reminiscent of Popeye's. Popeye's is one of my favorite chicken places, so for me to say it's like Popeye's is a good thing. Fries are fries so there isn't much to mention about that. However, the perch, is something I'm new to and am probably going to replace catfish with it! Tracy's description of the perch was spot on: more meaty and a little bit saltier. Prepared the same as the catfish, the perch's flavor really broke through and collided with my taste buds!

Tracy was very hospitable to let us try some of the perch already, but just when you though that was it, she came through with some freshly cooked shrimp that were te size of prawns! She told us to give them a try and let her know how they were. So, this goes out to Tracy: \"The shrimp and perch was the BOMB!\" :D This particular HC&F has potential to become something exceptional and definitely a local favorite! The space inside is large enough to host a live band on Friday or Satirday nights! Just a few ideas! :) Not only did the food have soul, but Tracy and her crew straight from Chicago had the spirit in them today too! I look forward to out next trip. Next time, we're bringing the whole crew down!"}
{"text":"we ordered chicken combo and small catfish dinner for 2 of us. were shocked with how much food we got. fish fillets huge. took home food will have another meal out of. people that wrote bland or nothing to write home about are nuts! catfish was best we ever ate. way better than hush puppies and chicken also some of best fried chicken ever ate. portions are huge. people you gotta try this place it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant based on other Yelp reviews and being in the area.  Place was very busy at 2PM on a Sat. afternoon (usually a good indication), but was able to find a table.  Took a while to get to the order counter due to the line, but not an issue.  Counter person taking orders was very busy but friendly, back counter staff were very busy and matter of fact.  Ordered some chicken, fries and the pizza puff.  Got cole slaw and bread as well (and some fries came with the chicken).

In general, I thought the food was ok - more like 2.5 stars (but gave the review the benefit of the doubt with 3 stars).  Chicken pieces were very large, but not particularly flavorful.  Breast pieces were very large, and slightly undercooked in the center, which was a bit of an issue - undercooked chicken is not a good thing.  I found most of the flavor was not from the chicken or coating, but from the sauces (we got the sauce on the side).  Mild sauce was sweet, hot sauce had a Frank's Hot Sauce vinegar-hot quality to it.

Fries were ok, pizza puff was interesting and ok.  I suspect this is a Chicago/Indiana tradition that is sought after from people from that area who now live in LV.  

I would much rather have M&M Soul Food (or even Popeyes) - more flavor and seasoning."}
{"text":"Did they go to Chicago to get our chicken & fish because it took friggin' forever to get our food! About 35 to 40 minutes to be exact which would not have been that bad had it been good - it wasn't. The chicken was bland and the only thing that made it OK was the crispy skin and the mild hot sauce which was way too sweet.  The fried catfish on the other hand was fairly tasty and the meal itself was huge. I would come back for the fish, but as far as the chicken goes, Popeye's is much tastier & quicker too. Way too expensive ($13.99) for a forgettable meal. Go back to Chicago, Harold & take your bland chicken with you."}
{"text":"We were trying to decide on someplace closeby and relatively cheap...  My friend had heard about this place and we figured why not give it a try.  It's relatively small inside and everything looked really clean.  

I went with a 1/2 chicken dinner and decided to try their fried chicken livers too.  Everything was cooked/fried to order, so expect it to be hot and fresh!  The chicken was definitely tasty... although the pieces seemed to be on the small side.  But still plenty of food for the price.  You can see the flecks of pepper and seasoning in the coating.  Definitely tasty chicken!  I had the mild sauce...  which almost seems like a mildly spicy ketchup.  It's good... but next time I'll try the hotter one.  The chicken livers were pretty much as expected...  pretty big sized and good.  Fries.... eh, not the best....  seems like they only fry them once, instead of twice like most places.  Cole slaw was delicious... creamy and a little sweet.... just the way I like it.

Kind of wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars...  I'll be back.... want to try the fried gizzards"}
{"text":"I'm really big on customer service & Harold's didn't disappoint. I put in a massive order for a church function and they were super friendly and efficient.  Of course, the food is great & they go out of their way to prepare it fresh & just the way you want it.  Don't sleep on Harold's!"}
{"text":"I was craving for some chicken wings so after worked, we stopped by Harold's.  I am from Texas so after seeing that Harold's offer chicken gizzards, I immediately ordered the gizzards and wings combo.  My boyfriend got the chicken giblets combo.

We chose a table close to the chilly entrance, not because we enjoy the chilly breeze, but because there were no other tables available.  The restaurant has about 7 tables or so.  As we were waiting for the food, I grabbed some napkins to clean our table and chairs of the chicken batter crumbs that were left behind by the previous customers.

The coleslaw and utensils arrived first at our table.  I was so hungry so I down the coleslaw.  It came in a teeny tiny container.  Awhile later, food arrived and they were all piping hot.  Yes, 2 wings, a pile of gizzards, and lots of french fries for me, chicken giblets and more french fries for my bf.  Gosh I wish there were 1 more extra wing and less gizzards.  My teeth are not the strongest teeth so chewing on the hard gizzard was quite tiring.  

Midway through the meal, I was all fried and gizzarded out and my bf had to get a diet coke to cut the richness of the giblets.  

Overall, eating this in moderation is alright, but I would probably save all those calories for wingstop wings.

But customer service was great.  I do want to come back to try the regular fried chicken though."}
{"text":"Do I have to give it a star? 
Very disappointed in this place! I can't believe all the hipe! We just got the basic chicken. 
I will never, ever go back to this place! Why pass by Popeyes and Churches chicken to go to this place! Kudos for opening a business, and creating jobs. This just doesn't float my boat!"}
{"text":"Apparently I've driven by this place a million times but never noticed it.  I was looking for new places to try online and found out about it, though, so I quickly made a trip over there.  

I arrived shortly before the lunch rush hit.   It's a fairly small place, with just 6 or 7 tables.  I get the feeling most people just get takeout.  While the cashier was quite upbeat, the service was fairly slow.  I just got a chicken strip meal with fries and a drink, and it took a good 10 minutes or so to prepare.  I asked for no cole slaw but they put it in there anyway.  

You get a decent amount of food for what you pay for, but nothing really sticks out as particularly good or special.  The chicken strips were standard fare, with a lot of pepper in the batter, and the fries were just fine.  I got the hot sauce and was fairly disappointed in it.  Like another reviewer said, it's basically straight from the bottle.  I'm pretty sure it's just Louisiana Hot Sauce or some knockoff -- a lot more vinegary/thinner than Frank's Red Hot, just to give you an idea of what to expect.  You also get a piece of bread with your meal.  It's not buttered, it's not toasted, just a plain piece of white bread which has soaked up some of the grease from the fries and strips.  I am fairly sure it was stale or left out for a while, too, as it was a bit dry/crunchy and had started to curl up.   Even though I didn't eat the slaw, it comes in a tiny container -- the tiny Solo cups you get from some places with ketchup in them.  According to their menu it's 2 ounces.  The hot sauce comes in the same size container and is absolutely not enough.  If you want extra you have to pay for it.  

Aside from chicken strips, regular fried chicken, and some fish, the menu doesn't have much else to offer.  If you want a side dish your options are only jalapeno peppers, okra, mushrooms, and cole slaw.  Seriously?  No mashed potatoes?  No biscuits?  No mac & cheese?  No green beans?  

The prices seem random and oddly overpriced in some places as well.  An extra hot sauce is $0.50, but a small cole slaw is $0.44.  Chicken wings cost over $1 each and can be ordered in sizes of 13, 18, or 24, but are 10 cents more expensive per wing if you order 24 than if you order 13.   That's right, more expensive the more you get.  

I love chicken but at best Harold's can just be called absolutely average in almost every respect and slightly disappointing."}
{"text":"I was super excited when I heard Harold's was opening up in Vegas. In my opinion Chicago has some of the best food around. I got the wing dinner and some extra chicken on the side with hot sauce. It was pretty packed when I went which was late afternoon but I only waited about ten minutes. I heard from another friend that the wait can be a lot longer and that they occasionally sell out in the evenings. I do wish they gave you more cold slaw and I'm not a huge fan of the fries because to me they are a little soggy. But I went for the chicken anyways which was perfectly fried to perfection."}
{"text":"Damn harolds gonna knock you down one star, last time I visited was a disappointment. The cook must've reached the bottom of their seasoning batter or perhaps the wings were brined for too long cause my wings were pretty salty.."}
{"text":"Harold's was a mainstay of my life in Chicago, and I was positively tremulous that my upcoming visit to Vegas would give me the chance to sup on these delectable birds.

Look, you're getting fried chicken here, not dinner with the Queen. Adjust expectations accordingly. Like the ones in Chicago, this is a hole-in-the-wall type place, small and not exactly sparking clean. But it's actually much nicer than the one I frequented in Chicago. No bulletproof glass, no sticky walls, no seedy crowds.

The chicken is deep-fried and crispy-hot. A half-chicken and soda will set you back a whopping 10 bucks. And it's served with/on fries with a tiny button of coleslaw. The only things missing are the two slices of white bread - come on, why drop the ball there! The hot sauce is the thing I love, nice and hot and tangy. There's BBQ style as well, if you want.

All in all, I was most satisfied with this Harold's - it would fit right in on the South Side."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  I really did.  I don't.  The place is non-descript, the person behind the cash register did not utter a single word during my order, nor during the orders of the next 4 groups that I observed.  I order a mixed chicken \"dinner\".  The cole slaw actually wasn't too bad but it was served in a small cup the size of two thimbles.  I think I got two spoonfuls out of it.  The french fries were ordinary.  The leg of the chicken was incredibly small, I mean really small.  Very little meat on the thigh, the wing, well I expect that; the breast did have meat, but it wasn't anything that extraordinary.  I did order the mild sauce.  It was ok.  All in all, I really doubt this place will be around in a year from now.  Exciting \"concept\", but poorly executed here... employees need personality, the portions need to be normalized, whoever orders the chickens, should splurge and order normal sizes.  Seems like they are cutting everything to the \"bone\" to save money, but they are cutting off their arm in the process.  You can easily do better in Las Vegas.  Really."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly not impressed by this place.  Vacant tables were not cleaned and there was generally uninspired staff and service.  The cashier didn't take my order correctly; she asked me about what sauce I wanted with my fish (tartar) and didn't put it in my takeout order.  Another customer approached the counter to ask for bread after it was left out of his dinner.  I subsequently found that it was left out of my dinner order as well.

The chicken, although nice and crispy, was pretty bland.  I'll say the same for the catfish (Old Bay seasoning, anyone?)  The cole slaw was not very fresh.  The Chicago Harold's left me with a better impression even though it was a hole-in-the-wall storefront spot.  I would not recommend that you waste your time or money at this place."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago, I passed by this shopping center in my neighborhood and saw the sign \"Harold's Chicken, Now Open!\".  I thought to myself \"That place sounds familiar, where do I know it from?\"......a couple of weeks go by and I forgot about it.  

Then, the other day I was starving and looking for a new joint to check out.  I looked on my Droid Yelp App and started doing a search for places....that's when I saw a review from Aljamin S on this place.  As soon as I read it, I remembered where I saw Harold's Chicken before.....in Southeast Chicago a couple of years ago.  I get really excited and call my friend in Vegas that's from Chicago who took me there.....he got excited and told me to get over there ASAP to check it out.

When I pulled up, I saw a sign that mentioned they were from Chicago...I got excited.  I asked the cook who was standing next to the cashier if they were the same Harold's Chicken from Chicago...he said yes....JACKPOT!

I eagerly ordered the 1/4 Chicken Dinner w/White Meat & Hot Sauce (2 Wings, 1 Breast, Fries, on top of a slice of White Bread, $5.99) and a Pizza Puff ($3.15).  After a short wait, they brought out my meal.....I opened up the bag with the Chicken and the smell of the Hot Sauce burned my sinuses....yes!  I couldn't wait to take a bite.  The Chicken and Fries drenched in Hot Sauce with the White Bread on the bottom to soak in the flavors was just as I remembered it in Chicago.  The Chicken was delicious and full of flavor.....my Hot Sauce tolerance has elevated since the last time I ate at Harold's, so the Hot Sauce tasted more mild to me than I remember....but it was good!  The Fries were soggy with the Hot Sauce....I forgot they did that and would have preferred them dry, my bad  I should have asked them to do that.  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!

Next was the Pizza Puff....if you've been reading my reviews for a while, you'll know I love Pizza Puffs and will order one any time I can find it.  They serve the Il Taco brand Pizza Puffs here....which is what I'm familiar with from Chicago.  mmmm......Pizza Puff goodness, yes!  If you are unfamiliar with a Pizza Puff, imagine a wallet sized pocket of Pizza Dough, with Pizza Sauce, Cheese, and Sausage in the middle.....it's not a Calzone because the crust is much thinner and it has a distinctive taste and flavor to it.  It's also deep fried....although you can bake it as well.  Anyway, I suggest you try one if given the opportunity.

Overall, it was an exciting day.  I called all of my Chicagoland friends who are transplants in Vegas to tell them about this place.

Will I return?  Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"My husband is from Chicago so he's the reason as to how I heard about this place. They just opened recently but you would NEVER know that, this place was super busy! 

We had the chicken and fries & pizza puff, -- SO GOOD. I've never had a pizza puff, it's like the totino's pizza rolls but WAY better & bigger! Almost everyone that was in there, had one! Chicken was good, it's breaded & seasoned, very good. 

The 4 stars is because of the seating, it was so packed and it's a very small restaurant so it fills quick. Luckily I had my son grab the first available table while we ordered. Other than that, awesome lil spot."}
{"text":"I was very SHOCKED to see this in Las Vegas first... But I couldn't resist trying it. It is close but no cigar. I ordered the fried catfish from the lady who talks to you without you knowing it. She was nice just need a different approach. 

She asked for my order \"what you need\", from the back side far behind the wall of the cooking area. It took 15 minutes to get luke warm food. I DO NOT like cold french fries...YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!! 

The setting of the restaurant was nice. the seating area is huge. This place has lots of potential but you have to step it up a noch because Harolds in the CHI is bomb... and they are the namesake.."}
{"text":"I've heard so many rave reviews of this place, I had to give it a try, even though it's a bit of a drive from work. I went with the Gizzards & Wings combo and added a small side of fried okra.

I have to be honest. I'm a little disappointed. I only got two wings in the order and the rest of the plate was gizzards. While they both tasted good, I was expecting more wings. Just my opinion, but the gizzards should be an accompaniment to the wings, not the other way around! I can only eat so many. The plate also comes with fries and some coleslaw. The fries were decent, but not as good as they could be.

I wanted to love this place, especially since they gave me extra food due to an error on their part. While I was waiting for my meal, the guy comes out and explains that the cook misheard and started preparing Giblets instead of Gizzards & Wings. They offered to give me the Giblet plate as well. I took the offer, but I'm so full from eating gizzards that I'm not sure if I'll ever get to it (it's in the fridge).

I'm a little fried out at the moment (and definitely gizzarded out), but I definitely want to come back and try something else. I'll probably try one of their chicken dinners or perhaps a fish plate. For now, I have to give them an A-OK."}

{"text":"\"Medicinal Fried Chicken\"

Sounds kinda funny, but I've been sick and the antibiotics made me even more crappy and the first thing I could think about was I want some fried chicken. It did hit the spot.

The BF and I shared:

A combo of white meat fried chicken & fried perch which was 3 big filets of fish, a breast and wing, 2 slices of white bread, and a handful of fries- plenty big portion. I was happy to find perch since I don't really see it often. It was pretty noms- fresh tasting and was juicy. Fried chicken was tasty with a good crisp and seasoned batter. Fries are pretty standard. 

We were curious of the pizza puff so we got also a pizza puff w/ fries. I've heard of it and finally got to try one.... it's like having a meat lasagna baked into a puff pastry crust. I'm not necessarily the pizza pocket type, but pretty decent stuff and I get why people like it. 

Drinks aren't from a fountain, but are bottled sodas. They do have a decent selection though. 

I saw they have fried livers and I kinda have a weak spot (probably literally- a nice and clogged spot) in my heart for that. I do wish they have gravy to dip em in, but that's just a personal preference I can't hold against them too much. Maybe I'll bring my own. 

Will be back for more fried fare!"}

{"text":"**Summary**
       - Breading - For their catfish, they use cornbread breading, but it isn't as flavorful as catfish alley. With that said, it's still a very good catfish.
       - Portions - The portions are humongus. The Lg. Catfish Fillets comes with five gigantic catfish. They're twice the size of other places.
**Price**
       - $20 fed four of us and we couldn't finish.
**Ordered**
       - Large order of Catfish Filets (5) - Five delicious, gigantic fish fillets with cornbread breading with french fries and a piece of toast.
       - Side of Okra - The okra is good. My favorite place for okra is still church's (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nupAsas-_hc8225O_5APMQ?select=4_Ru-8uSrii9KihGoVSxgw).
       - Large order of gizzards - A bit too little seasoning, but it was still good. This also came with french fries and a piece of toast (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nupAsas-_hc8225O_5APMQ?select=DkSR9q6z7Kmp-oOjwEjqCQ).
**Recommendations**
       - Compared to the other catfish places around town, I have to rank this second for flavor, but definitely first for value. I still prefer catfish alley's catfish for their incredible spices in their breading. As for value though, the filets here are twice as large and the prices are alot lower."}
{"text":"Ok, here's the deal, if you liked gizzards Harold's is the real deal. If you like cornmeal breaded fish Harold's is the real deal. I cooked and managed restaurants for 12 years and can say that on my best day I couldn't do any better. I have yet to try a piece of chicken cause I can't get past the gizzards. If you never had chicken gizzards, this is not like a piece of chicken tender, it's a tough lean bit of a chew and my jaws are burning by the time I finish a large order and it's worth the trip across town to get them. Please go as often as possible we want them to be around for a long time."}
{"text":"Everyone that knows me know that I love good fried chicken, and am extremely picky.  But Harold's really didn't do it for me.

Was it the fact that they made me sit there for over 30 minutes for my order, or that the chicken itself wasn't really worth the wait?  I am unsure.

I did not try the catfish, the gizzards (not really into that stuff), or mostly everything else.  I did get my husband a pizza pocket and I thought it was massively greasy and kind of gross.

This is a much better option than going to KFC and probably Popeye's, but honestly it might be a better idea to go to your local Smiths or Albertsons to get chicken than going here."}

So my daughter says I am craving fried chicken - can we go to KFC.  I said yes to fried chicken no to KFC.  I had heard about Harolds on Yelp, so let's get in the car a go for a drive.

The place was packed.  Always a good sign.  We ordered a half chicken and an order of gizzards.  I ordered the gizzards just to try something new.  

I have never had gizzards before so I have nothing to compare them to - but I would say I dont like them.  Not that the gizzards were bad, I just didn't care for them.

The Chicken was dang tasty.  The breast meat was super juicy and that is what is important.  The Chicken was not greasy and had a thin crispy skin.  

The pieces of chicken were on the small side, but maybe they use real chicken instead of super steriod chickens you see at the grocery store... so that could be a good thing.

The only 2 suggestion for a better over all experience: 1.  The side of coleslaw was in a 1 oz sauce container???  Thanks for the one bite of coleslaw.  2. I would like to see more side dishes.

They have perch on the menu too.  I gotta go back and taste that - perch is good fish."}
