{"text":"Wanted to try a new restaurant and randomly wandered into Bricco. As soon as we walked in the restaurant we were immediately greeted by a friendly host. Very tasty meal, great service. 
Mexican pizza very good. 
Dessert  was Apple spice cake very good."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to eating here since my fiancè and I moved to Kent. Finally had a chance to and we were extremely disappointed. We got an appetizer, Risotto Balls, for $7.50 we got 5 small fried balls of cheese. They were also at the lower spectrum of Luke Warm. Yuck! Next we got 3 pieces of complimentary bread, we spread what we thought was butter on the bread, it turned out to be some weird extremely sweet vanilla frosting. What??? My fiancè got the Macaroni and Cheese with candied bacon. Absolutely awful. There were a total of 4 small pieces of bacon and maybe 20 noodles. It tasted like starch. Barely any cheese. I got the Mexican Pizza, which was actually decent despite the $14 price tag. 

Overall, service was good. Everything else was awful."}
{"text":"The food was not bad...especially being that much of it was made in house, including their dressings.  However, if you have allergies/a vegan diet that need accommodating there aren't much in the way of options as it says online, which was misleading.  Unfortunately, their menu is outdated and lists things that they don't offer anymore.  The cost wasn't worth the quality/quantity in my opinion.  The service was subpar as well.  We had gone for lunch when it was quiet and there were only two other tables.  There was one fella waiting on all of us and he wasn't particularly service oriented.  He did not give us much information about what was offered, we more or less had to inquire about each and any of the food options we were interested in individually, he didn't even ask us what dressings we wanted with our side salads. Overall, I wouldn't say it was worth the money.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"The service at Bricco has always been great. The servers are very attentive and friendly. The martinis are fantastic, especially the espresso martini. I have only tried a handful of items on the menu, and they have all been really good! The only complaint I have is with take out. Some of the food just hasn't been as good. For example, a pizza I ordered was very soggy, and the mac and cheese was very dry. I would recommend dining in."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. Had a small problem with the wine menu but Jake the manager took care of it quickly and in our favor. I would recommend this restaurant to all in the area."}
{"text":"I got the wedge salad with blackened chicken and BBQ pulled pork. It was very good. However, according to the menu it was supposed to have prosciutto on it. there may have been two or three tiny pieces.

I was in a large group and appetizers were brought first. They were all pretty decent. bean dip was good the stuffed wontons were decent and the choizo and rice stuffed peppers were also ok, nothing special. 

I also ordered the Mexican pizza, which despite the excellent combination of toppings, chipotle bean base with chicken, chorizo, tomatoes, red peppers, and 3 cheeses, I could not get past how tasteless the crust was. The chicken and chorizo were very well seasoned and full of flavor, but the crust tasted like cardboard, frozen microwave pizza variety, very disappointing.  Some more salt would be a start, but they definitely need to trash their dough recipe and start again from scratch. 

Overall the other dishes I saw looked very good, salmon, filet, and mahi mahi, although the portions on the meat were small. A few people got dessert and they all looked amazing. I think it's pretty difficult to prepare a dessert that doesn't look and taste good."}
{"text":"This place will try to lure you in with the appearance that it has. Take my advice and don't go. The food is not very good. I ordered a buffalo Chicken sandwich and it was made of 3 Tyson buffalo flavored chicken strips. The frys were cold to the touch. Nice setting, mediocre food. Save the money and go to McDonald's, because that food is better than what you get here."}
{"text":"Wow, what happened.  I brought my mom and dad here last March for dinner and had a pretty good experience. Fast forward to this evening and it was downright awful. I had a feeling when the host was not really attentive and smiling this may have been an off night?  My wife and I ordered appetizers and beers. Sadly our appetizers took over twenty minutes to reach our table. The waiter was not attentive and seemed to have cared less. Never apologized for the food being late, never refilled drinks even tho our glasses were empty. He walked right by with a pitcher of water as well. No eye contact. Do yourself a favor and dine across the street or next door. Laziza or Bar 145 would be a better option. Better food and service elsewhere in Kent"}
{"text":"I ordered four different starters. They were quite good, and I was very full. Total bill including tax, without tips was $41"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Food was terrible.  Brunch on Sunday with my niece.  French toast came without any powdered sugar, cinnamon..etc.  Just a small amount of syrup and bacon that was not crisp.  Lacking any pizza choices for those that prefer simple taste, I finally settled on a chicken alfredo pizza.  The crust was delicious , the chicken was grilled well, but had no other seasoning or taste, and the sauce and cheese were bland.   When the waitress noticed upon presentation of check that my niece had not eaten the French toast, we said it had no taste. Her reply, was \"you should have told me and I would have gotten you something else.\"  Umm what?  She had a hard time finding something on your menu that met her youthful palate.  When a kid tells you the food is blah...it's blah.  Atmosphere - 5 stars, Food, 1.5 - a waste of a $30 lunch.
."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was horrible. Was part of large party, took us 3 hours to have a salad and some spaghetti. It was disappointing. Based on my experience, I wouldn't even give if another chance."}
{"text":"Bricco wasn't as good as I had been hoping for.

My husband and I were meeting some friends here that we hadn't seen in months for a special dinner over Labor Day weekend (Saturday night). Our friends had made the reservation and were seated right away--not even half of the restaurant was filled.

My husband and I had gotten there after our friends had, but even after arriving late it took our waitress 15-20 minutes to take our order (including drinks). We were pretty sure she had forgotten about us. 

We ordered the Charcuterie as an appetizer and it came out relatively quickly and was very good. Our food came out about 20-30 minutes later and my friends and husband seemed to enjoy theirs. I, however, didn't. I had gotten the Veggie Stir Fry with mahi-mahi and it was tasteless. It was so bland and the fish was dry due to being overcooked. On top of it, that dish alone was $17. My husband and I split the Tres Leche cake, which was okay. We enjoyed the flavor, but the cake was so dense and it had a grainy texture.
While my husband enjoyed his Pork Tenderloin, he said he wouldn't pay the $15-20 again for it. 

When our waitress came to bring our checks, she was chewing gum REALLY LOUD with her mouth open. In a nice restaurant, where I'm spending $20+ per person, seeing a waitress chewing gum grosses me out. (She wasn't even trying to hide it...She was chewing it so loudly. Gross!)

Overall, the food here is overpriced for the quality that they give you. For my husband and myself, our bill with tip was just under $60. I'd rather go somewhere else, like the Cheesecake Factory, if I plan to spend that much money on food and want a nice dinner/dessert.

I'd give this place 2 stars, but my friends enjoyed it so much that I'm giving it 3.
I will not be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. My wife and I have eaten here often and have never had a bad experience.  The food is fresh and tasty.  We highly recommend Bricco."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have eaten at this location. The first time, about a year ago, we thought the food wasn't memorable, but good enough.  The restaurant is attractive and the staff are friendly, which goes a long way to cover less than fabulous food, so today we stopped in again.  Maybe we should have tried the pizzas which seem to be better rated.  Today, I had the  Candied Bacon Mac, and it was pretty poor at any price, let alone $11.  Perhaps it was my mistake to expect an entree Macaroni to be at least baked.  What I got was a small portion of (boiled?) pasta swimming in thin cheese sauce that was more like a ladle of cheese soup.  The candied bacon was nearly invisible - maybe one small chopped slice for the whole plate.  Really, it reminded me of the macaroni you get in a TV dinner or a cheap buffet.  My husband had the Stir Fry and again, besides being small for the price, it was in his words \"almost hospital food bland\".  Service was also very slow, considering the restaurant was almost empty.  No problems with the waitress.  So, nice people, nice place, slow service and, on this occasion, really poor food.  I hate leaving negative reviews, but with lots of other choices in the area, we probably won't be back unless we hear from someone that the food has drastically improved."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is neat and our waiter was great however most of our meals were served cold and they weren't able to handle a large party of people. The manager was unprofessional and not helpful. Won't go back here."}
{"text":"Housed in a new building in a revitalized block of downtown Kent within walking distance of the University.  Eight of us had a big family dinner here on a Saturday night so we sampled a bit of everything. The appetizers were standouts, esp. the risotto balls, the large sea scallops wrapped in bacon and the chef's duck breast du jour.  The salads were likewise good, (can be ordered half size too, a nice option), and the pizzas had a good crust and generous toppings.  Entrees were just okay, but all seemed overpriced by a couple of bucks.  Everyone liked their drinks from the bar and the desserts were excellent. The place was close to full and loud, but our server was courteous and efficient.  We would visit again"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and I wasn't that impressed with the service or food.

I was seated immediately when I walked in and choose to sit outside. The guy that sat me down was very nice. The waiter came immediately, however, that was the last of the quick service. Bread was brought to the table with saucers, and silverware. I ordered water with lemon and a lone crabcake.

The food was actually brought out pretty quickly. However, it was missing the sauce so the guy that seated me had to go and get some. The sauce was delicious and ultimately made the crab cake edible. The crab cake itself was stuffed with peppers, onions and possibly other stuff but if lacked flavor and taste. Again, I was able to eat it because of the yummy sauce. 

I would eat here again and try something else but not in the near future."}
{"text":"The first two items I ordered they didn't have. So I ended up ordering the duck. Except for being a little chewy it was good. I like the atmosphere and the server was very apologetic. This was my first time so I will go back."}
{"text":"Service is slow but very friendly, and the whole place is windows so it's a pleasant spot to sit and people-watch. The problem is the food. Pizza is thick and doughy. Pasta is overcooked and mushy. Chicken is dry. Tomato sauce is bland and tasteless. Such a cute place but I'd recommend you go just for drinks and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had never eaten here before this week, and now i have eaten here twice in 4 days. The first time, I wasn't all too impressed. I went for lunch, and they were out of bread from Valentine's Day weekend. I started off with the brussel sprouts appetizer, which was delicious, but the croutons were totally unnecessary in it. I then got the spinach ravioli. It was the perfect size but a little bland. Not terrible though. Last night, I started with the bacon wrapped scallops, which were delicious. The sauce they were in was heaven. They also had bread this time around. I got the shrimp Angel hair, which was also the perfect amount. It was so good. I wish there had been more shrimp in it though. There were only 4 or 5 pieces. Our service was so/so the first time, but the 2nd time, it was wonderful. I'd go back again ... I'm just going to wait a little longer until the next time."}
{"text":"My wife and I really want to like this place and we have been twice.  Both times, the service was quite nice and the ambience was chic and classy.  A good new restaurant for Kent.  When I went for lunch a couple of weeks ago, the sandwich I had  was fine.  

But dinner was a different story.  My crab cakes ($20 without any side) were quite mediocre, tasting more of breading than crab.  My wife ordered a chicken, mushroom and pappardelle dish  ($14 without sides) which was overly salty.  Since this can mar any dish, it is something the cooks need to watch out for.

With side salads, the cost is about $50 for two without drinks.  I think for this price, the entrees should be better than something we could easily whip up at home."}
{"text":"The white chocolate and mind chocolate martinis are soooooo yummy! 4 stars that would have been 5 with a little friendlier service. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A great addition to Kent!
Some things on the menu are a bit pricy for a college town but I like having the option to splurge on awesome food. 
It's hard to find a parking space near by but it's worth the walk."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a large group of loud, silly friends/coworkers. At first, it seemed like our waitress was worried we were just a bunch of annoying college kids who'd probably not tip her. But, little did she know, we all work in food service and take tipping very seriously. As soon as we all individually ordered multiple drinks, appetizers, and entrees, she knew what was up. She also didn't write down our orders, she just remembered everything and everyone received the correct drinks/dishes (impressive ). Our server was very delightful, attentive, and timely. I ordered several martinis (all were great even though I'm not usually a fan of sweet things), calamari as an appetizer (delish!) and chicken polenta for my entree (also yummy). Our whole experience was easy going, fun, and enjoyable. I don't remember our waitresses name, but she was really sweet and played a tremendous role in our great experience."}
{"text":"Bricco at lunch is just terrible. I have only been there a couple times, but the service has been slow both times. Today it took an HOUR between ordering and receiving our food. The soup of the day was good but not hot. The burger was ordered \"medium\" but it was well done by the time it arrived--apparently under the heat lamp a long time (and the person to my right also had the same experience). The burger was no longer hot and was on a dry bun. No mayo, no condiments at the table. I asked for ketchup. If I had not been with a group I would have left before the food came. I didn't want to spend an hour waiting for lunch on a slow Friday. It was soooo long that it became the topic of discussion at the table; who is getting hangry? The waitress made apologetic comments \"I keep checking with the kitchen--just a moment more!\" I will not be back to Bricco."}
{"text":"I visited Bricco twice and had the same experience both times. The service was very slow after ordering--longer than normal. Once our appetizer arrived, it was lukewarm. When the entree arrived, the food was presented well, hot and tasty. My steak was ordered medium rare but was more medium though, a good cut and nicely seasoned. I love that I have never had to wait to be seated and the proximity to my regular hotel--just across the street. Overall, I will return when in Kent."}
{"text":"The food is sketchy at best.  We have sent more back than ate as deliver.  The bartenders and drinks make up for the subpar food.  Great spot for drinks and people watching"}
{"text":"Bricco has no window for martinis!! They are filled to the bitter top of the glass!! Atmosphere is welcoming and inviting. Very cozy and superb decor. Good food and good service. Very happy with our bartender/server Kyle! Great to watch Cavs game at the bar! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Good food and good wine selections. Everyone is very friendly. Service is great. Luv hanging out at the bar. Would definately recommend this place. 
Thx 
DR MD"}
{"text":"Server wasn't bad, but food was awful! It was so bad to the point that I didn't even ask for it to go...this is probably the first time that I didn't want my food to go in my entire life. Yikes! Very disappointed....felt like a waste of money and calories."}
{"text":"Our experience at Bricco last night started off as mediocre and escalated to abysmal by the end thanks to mediocre food and terrible customer service. I would not even bother to write this review right now had it not been for the manager who treated us so poorly at the end of our meal. (Get out of retail, dude!) I digress. My husband and I arrived first out of our large party. We ordered drinks (mead for me and beer for him) as well as the goat cheese and marinara appetizer. It was okay. I wouldn't get it again. We ordered food when our friends arrived. He got the crab cakes and I got the wedge salad and truffle fries. (I know, weird order, but nothing else looked that appealing to me.) Crab cakes were, again, just okay. The truffle fries were great! The wedge salad... Well, I'm not sure how you did it, Bricco -- but congrats on ruining a wedge salad with the overpowering dressing. I don't think anyone in our group ate everything on their plate. This is the part where it goes from mediocre to abysmal. I ordered the Botanical martini because the ingredients sounded like my ideal drink and I had enjoyed something similar at another restaurant before. It turned out to be basically a glass of straight-up gin and undrinkable. I stirred it. I added ice to it. Still undrinkable. Three people at our table tried it and confirmed this. We alerted the server who was very nice about it and took my drink away which was still 99% full. She said she would take it off our check. She quickly came back and said there was a disclaimer on the drink menu that they don't refund or return drinks so there was nothing she could do, and she asked her manager. I asked to see the menu, and sure enough.... It said at the top to \"read ingredients and ask questions\" because they do not refund or return drinks blah blah blah. We weren't happy, especially because we were already paying $70 for meals we didn't particularly enjoy. She could tell we weren't satisfied with this answer, so she went to get her manager. This guy was SO incredibly rude to us. He fought us tooth and nail over this $10 drink and even though he and the server were insisting there was \"nothing they could do\" -- turns out there was. He took the drink off of our check with no apology and terrible customer service. A smart solution would have been to give us a $10 gift card and a sincere apology. This gives the customer the impression they are getting the money refunded and guarantees either a second visit where the restaurant would STILL profit considerably or the card would simply collect dust in a wallet and would serve as a token of a restaurant trying to make it right. Just an idea. I wouldn't eat there again even if I were paid to do so, but maybe something like this can be put into place for future patrons."}
{"text":"I was really excited when Bricco came to Kent. I was expecting a high(er)-end addition to the established bar scene. I love the decor, and having a patio is always a bonus. Plus, the staff are usually pretty good, even on busy nights. 

But the food just doesn't measure up. The pizza is mediocre and overpriced, and the appetizers are inconsistent. On the one hand, I've enjoyed the risotto balls and the crab cake appetizers. But on the other, I tried the goat cheese with marinara appetizer, and there was no cheese to be found - just a bowl of spicy marinara sauce with fried bread for dipping. And that's not the only dish I've been disappointed by.

Their drink menu is pretty extensive and decently-priced, and like I said, I've enjoyed the patio and bar area when I've visited. But I'll probably stick to what I know is ok if I end up at Bricco again - the food is too unreliable to risk trying something new."}
{"text":"My friend was in town and I took her here for a fun dinner and drinks. Lots of tables were full with Christmas Party people, but we got right in on a Saturday with no wait due to some snow that was expected to come. 

She got a glass of wine and I got a Moscow mule with a green tea twist, no drink complaints besides the fact that it took a good 10-12 minutes from the time we ordered them to actually get them. 

I then got the Mac and cheese with grilled chicken and my friend ordered the Alfredo with a grilled chicken substitute instead of the shrimp. It took a while for our meals to come, but we weren't exactly starving or watching the clock because we were busy catching up. When they finally came, she brought the bread basket then too. It would've been nice to have that with our drinks, and it appeared the other tables around us did, so she must've forgotten. 

I don't have any particular complaints about my
Meal besides the fact that it was $13 and then an additional $4-5 (I forget exactly) to add chicken. No side salad or anything included. So $13 for Mac is already kind of pushing it, in my opinion, unless it's the most amazingly cheesy deliciousness I've ever tasted.  And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything crazy special. So adding some pretty bland grilled chicken on top and taking it to $17 was definitely not worth it. My friend liked her chicken Alfredo, but did comment that it wasn't a typical Alfredo like she was anticipating.  It was a thin clear sauce as opposed to what you'd expect, a creamier white sauce. So it kind of caught her off guard. 

All in all, it's the kind of place that is intended to be a fun, more fancy or special occasion night out kind of restaurant, and the prices reflect that, but the food quality does not. This was the gist I got from all the other reviews already on this page, but I wanted to see for myself. I would probably not return for a date night with my husband because the food was so-so and I know of other places in the area where the food is much better quality for a similar price."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Bricco! Great appetizer selection, especially the goat cheese, risotto balls, and banana peppers! I LOVE when they have the Buffalo Chicken Soup, wish it was available every day!!! Hubby loves the Cajun Chicken - it is spicy and the chicken is blackened (not something everyone will like). I have only been disappointed once - I got the Shrimp Alfredo and there was just WAY too much pepper in the dish, it was overpowering. Interesting because usually it does not have much pepper at all - maybe a different chef? Also love the steak & wedge salad. The martinis are fantastic - definitely try a drink if you go there. 
Bricco is a common spot for date night!"}
{"text":"This place may have average food, but the service is just terrible. It should not be so hard to get water or bread. This would be ok if the place was busy or there was a shortage of staff..but it was the complete opposite. I dunno why service was wacky and kinda rude. No one seemed apologetic about the situation. It's like the restaurant isn't used to having people in it, because we kept being told how \"busy\" the kitchen is. Once u get your food, it looks good because your hungry.  Then you taste it, and it's such a let down!"}
{"text":"Had another frustrating experience today at Bricco. We booked the party room for a small birthday party for my two sons. I was told we had the room until 12:30pm due to a booking at 1:00pm. A few minutes before noon a woman from the next booking entered in a tizzy and told us we had to leave because they had placed a deposit for their party. It's a shame this woman rudely interrupted our family get-together and narcissistically implied her gathering was more important, but I do empathize that she was in a situation where she expected to have an empty party room upon arrival. Then the GM, Brad, came out and abruptly announced in front of the group that we had to leave. Not even a nice, pull one of us aside to politely explain the situation talk, but just walked out the service door and told us we had to leave and that the gentleman that booked us never should have. He did not offer to put together another area for us to sit and finish our gathering even! I absolutely expected a much more professional approach from the GM as this was NOT an error on our part. It was rude, tacky, and slightly embarrassing. Maybe if the food wouldn't have taken over an hour after ordering, we would have been out of the room even earlier. I will never frequent this establishment again personally or with business or non-profit bookings. There are much better professional, customer-appreciating restaurants in the Kent area to visit. Thank a lot for ending a birthday party for a five and eight year old on a sour note."}
{"text":"Overpriced. I got the flat iron Alfredo and the steak was so tough & chewy, I ended up just eating the pasta. My boyfriend's strip steak was ordered medium rare and look more like medium well. I expected better food for how busy it was."}
{"text":"So I decided to dine here after a meeting at Kent State. It was 4 in the afternoon on a Thursday.  So the place was empty.  I was literally the only person in the dining room.  There were a few guys in the bar area.

Being said that I was the ONLY person in the restaurant.....I could not understand why the host tried to seat me at a table directly outside the kitchen door and in the main walkway??!!!  I had to ask to be sat by the window.  Really?  SMH

OK no big deal, so very quickly the waitress who was very pleasant and conversational came to take my drink order.  Thank you.

While I waited for my drink, I went to the restroom.  The trash bin was overflowing and the sink was a wet sloppy mess.  Again....middle of afternoon between lunch and dinner rush?  

This leads me to the next major point.  The restaurant itself is FILTHY!  The carpet is so dirty it looks greasy. There were paper scraps and crumbs and food droppings as well as dust around every single table bottom.  Which I could see well because I WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE!!!!!  Also, my water glass and all the glasses on the adjoining tables looked extremely scratched and worn.  I should have taken pictures. Also....there was a funky trash smell that permeated the whole time. I actually had to throw my clothes in the wash when I got home because I kept smelling it.

So my drink comes out....it is FABULOUS! I ordered the grapefruit martini. I highly recommend it.  The drink is the saving grace for my review.  

I ask a few questions about the menu and the waitress was very forthcoming with suggestions and info.  I decided to order the stuffed pork loin.....which at $19 did not come with a salad....so I ordered a garden salad as well on the side. After placing my order she brought a basket of bread.  The sweet butter that was served with it was really good.  The bread unfortunately was dried out.

The lemon salad dressing was very tasty and the best part of my meal.  This is where my meal really went downhill.  My entree came out quite awhile after my salad.  Which really was ok because I was in no hurry. However, being that I WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE and it was early.....I was extremely disappointed to find my meat barely warm.  It was obviously not freshly made.  The meat looked soggy and grey.  You know, like leftovers.  The side of roasted root veggies that came with it were so hard they were almost raw. I mentioned this to the waitress who apologized and offered to rewarm the dish, but I declined.  (Funny about sending food back)

So I finished my meal and asked for a to go container for half of my main entree.

I kind of expected the manager to stop by due to my comment about the tepid entree and taking it to go....but he did not.  My meal cost me nearly $40.  It was NOT worth it. I will not be returning and I do not recommend this restaurant unless you are only going into the bar area for the drinks."}
{"text":"Bad food. Don't go here. They need to change the menu and make it more vegetarian friendly. I went here twice. The first time I got a dish with quinoa and it was way undercooked. I'm not a fan of this place and it's expensive."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Very simple, unambitious menu. Good interior. Service is very slow- if you're hungry and come here expect to stay hungry. But the food is undeniably good. If you can park right in front and sit outside with friends it's fun- otherwise ehhhh"}
{"text":"The best way for me to describe this restaurant is imposter. You walk in thinking this is an upscale place, I see similarities to other high end restaurants...small things here and there but the feeling is there. The menu offerings where all over the place from fried pickles to pizza and pasta and stir fry to calamari, scrimp and scallops. \"Jack of all trade is a master of none\" comes to mind here...
We ordered tortilla soup, fried pickles, Greek salad and a weird pasta dish. The soup was definitely out the can poured over a scoop of beef, the tortilla chips were clearly warmed up and sprinkled with sea salt. The fried pickles were flavorless. I asked the waiter if she could  bring another order of the pickles that weren't burnt and they cam back the same way  hot out the frier...which tells me that they haven't changed their greese in years. I would NEVER come back here. Not worth it. Although our waiter was nice the food gets a  big 0."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!!! Outside covered patio and fun creative cocktails. So many sandwich, wraps and salad options. You must get the risotto balls, they were amazing and cooked perfectly and creamy. I also go a blackened chicken Caesar and was perfect and came with roasted red peppers which were perfect. And off course a pomegranate cosmopolitan which was perfect to sip on the patio. Overall a wonderful experience and the staff was friendly and very quick with everything. I will be back for sure!!!! $-$$"}
{"text":"Second time here.  Food is very good.  But the service was lacking both times.  Seated an hour before receiving salad or appetizers.  

Will come back.  Food is the best I have found in Kent.  Just make sure you have at least 2 hours for your meal."}
{"text":"Great menu, okay ambiance, BUT.. Horrible service during my visit... And cold steak, and uninspired brussel sprouts.. Made for a bad experience."}
{"text":"Get the duck, it's phenomenal. The rest of the food, meh. But the martini's are to die for. Like seriously the best espresso martini you're going to find in NE Ohio"}
{"text":"I heard the pizza was great so I ordered the steak to better judge menu choices and kitchen capabilities.  It was average at best.  The high, unfinished, industrial style ceilings mean it's so loud you'll need to phone your table mates in order to carry on a conversation. This location at least well be low on my list."}
{"text":"The Kent location is beautiful, but doesn't come close to the downtown Akron location when it comes to food and service.  I used to frequent this restaurant with friends, but everytime we have visited, things got worse and worse.  One visit, the appetizers we always ordered were literally half the size that they were a couple weeks prior, and the price certainly didn't change.  I'm not paying Ruth's Chris prices to chew on a scallop like it's a piece of taffy. 

Great spot to get drunk on discount martinis, but the food is disappointing."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here about 5 times and their bourbon bar is great, my boyfriend is a big bourbon fan! They offer Valet. Food is good Italian"}
{"text":"The food is the only thing I actually enjoy about this place.. the service was absolutely awful. My boyfriend has a gluten allergy... he asked for a MARKED gluten free item and just kindly asked him to notify the chef it needed to be gluten free, the server made a rude response about how he has no say in what happens to the food.... never refilled our drinks.. made fun of me for ordering off the bar menu instead of the dinner menu... also took our orders with a hand full of dishes for another table, when I told him it was okay to set down the dishes before taking our order he responded \"it's not like they are going to disintegrate\" HORRIBLE SERVICE. I felt bullied every time the server approached the table. Save yourself the public humiliation and order take out instead."}
{"text":"Been here twice (about one year apart). Food was good both times, but the service was only fair both times, too. Set at the bar both times. Bartenders (tonight - Andy) could be more friendly toward new patrons and less chatty with their regulars/friends.  Took a while to get waited on and another good while for food to arrive.  Andy was responsive when asked/pressed, but only gave a minimal effort.  Cool atmosphere. Good menu. Would go back - will sit at table next time and try traditional server."}
{"text":"Of course Kent decides to put all of these cool spots downtown after I graduate!! It's so nice to go back and visit and have options though. I liked Bricco--the atmosphere was nice and had a modern yet cozy feel. We sat in the bar area which made it more casual but no so bar-esque, as some bar seating tends to be. Everything we ordered was very good. We started with the risotto balls that were sooo delicious that I could have had another order for my meal. My friend and I split the lobster ravioli and I would totally order it again if I went back. Great new spot in Kent!"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp and scallop risotto. It was delicious! Large perfectly cooked scallops. Great flavor to the risotto. Friend ordered the risotto balls and they were ok but I loved the marinara and goat cheese appetizer, so did the other 3 people dining with me. The chicken parm looked good, friends are 1/2 the huge portion and took the rest home. Smaller portion of the ravioli, friend are all of it. We had no implants. 

Server was attentive at the start and let us sit there and talk for almost 2 hrs. She didn't keep pestering us to order more or make us feel unwelcome. I highly recommend this place and will return for the scallops!"}
{"text":"I was surprised when I checked in on Yelp that Bricco only had 2.5 stars. I came here with my husband with his brother and wife the other night. It was surprising to see a higher end place in Kent since it's mostly a college town. The entire downtown area is completely new and different since I went to Kent. This would definitely be a \"fancy\" and date night place if I was still in college, however I'm an old fart now so the $8 martinis were a score in my eyes. They are a must! 

We started our meal off with the calamari and fried pickles. They calamari was topped with a cream sauce which was very good and accommodated the plate well. The fried pickles were basic, but good. 

For meals, my husband and I split the salmon wrap and the chorizo pizza with a side of the truffle fries. The pizza was served on nann and was perfectly cooked. It was a decent size and great for sharing. The salmon wrap was ok- I would ask for the tortilla chips not in it next time- it gave it an awkward crunch. 

My brother in law got the wedge salad with the scallop appetizer. His scallops were big and wrapped in bacon. My sister in law got the chicken Parmesan and she said it was very tasty- lightly breaded. They also gave us a side of bread and butter. The butter was soft and somewhat sweet. It was so good! Make sure you ask for it- I believe they serve it for lunch and dinner. 

The prices were reasonable, but wraps and sandwiches didn't include sides so most meals will be $14-$20 for dinner. Lunch has a comparable menu, at half the cost though."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were planning on heading up to Fairlawn Friday night to have dinner at Cafe Bricco, which is about 35 minutes away. I went online and was thrilled to discover that a Bricco location had opened in Kent, 10 minutes down the road.  The restaurant is located in the Main St. Shopping area near the KSU Hotel and Conference Center.  Bricco offers valet parking, but we opted to park in the garage directly across the street.  Being a Friday night right before Valentine's Day, the place was expectedly packed. The decor was modern and the restaurant very open and spacious.  We were seated immediately. Within about a minute our server, Taylor, was at our table to take our drink and appetizer orders.  I ordered the risotto balls and my fiancé ordered the stuffed banana peppers.  Given that the restaurant was extremely busy, the appetizers came out fairly quickly.  Both appetizers were plated nicely and were served with marinara sauce, which was very good.  The risotto balls were highly recommended by reviewers and totally lived up to the hype.  She loved the stuffed peppers and appreciated all of the gluten free options on the menu.  For entrees, I ordered the shrimp and scallops with bacon, apple, and scallion risotto with white wine and butter sauce. Taylor was more than happy to sub out green beans for asparagus at my request.  My fiancé ordered the pork chops with root vegetables and maple compound butter.  Given that the restaurant was extremely busy we had a little wait for our food.  Wow, was the wait worth it!  Both of us were thrilled with our selections.  Shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly.  I had never tried apple in risotto, but it was absolutely delicious.  She loved the pork chops and particularly the maple butter.  She also ordered the Pink Elephant Martini, which may be her new favorite drink.  Our meal all together ran about $70.  Not cheap, but not overpriced in my opinion.  You get what you pay for. In this case nice decor, outstanding food and stellar service.  We couldn't stop talking about this place the following day, and are already planning our next visit.  Great overall experience!"}
{"text":"We used to love the Bricco in Akron. Although, the staff hasn't always been the friendliest. However, since we live closer to the Kent location, we have tried going there on multiple occasions hoping the last time was a fluke but now are done permanently. We have had terrible meals every single time! It's unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and under flavored for the price. It's definitely a college town dining experience, but not worth the price. The special \"shrimp\" bisque was nothing more than cream soup with a little bit of ahrimp flavor. No shrimp to speak of. The beet salad was good , except the \"beets\" we're Cannes beets out of a can. Then the main meal was \"lobster\" ravioli. I can't vow for the lobster because it tasted more like canned tuna. So there you have it."}
{"text":"Great service! Prices are reasonable. Portions are definitely appropriate. Bread is really unique tasting and a little sweet! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We've been to the Kent location twice and the Akron restaurant several times.  Such a great place to get an upscale yet affordable meal. A great addition to the College Town Kent area.  My favorites are the Bikinitini (coconut, grenadine, pineapple, vodka, etc.) and the goat cheese and marinara appetizer.  Out of 13 people, we had 4 or 5 separate orders of the goat cheese, so you know it's good!  I've had the Scallops and shrimp twice- pretty good, though I've already decided I'm getting the crab cakes next time.  My fiancé is also a fan of the beef shoulder dish.  You really can't go wrong here. Any of the chocolate dessert martinis are tasty, too. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great ambience and very prompt service. Had vet recently been to the restaurant with my friends and ended up having a great time with delicious meals and a great hazelnut white chocolate truffle. The prices are very reasonable and would definitely eat there again"}
{"text":"Had lunch here a few weeks ago. Ordered a meatball sandwich. Meatballs were small, obviously frozen and tasted like nothing. The peppers and onions that came on them were flaccid, drenched in oil, and weren't seasoned. My friend ordered a pasta dish that tasted only like vinegar. Had a similar issue with the Pub Bricco in the Valley. Not sure how this guy has three restaurants. All the food is completely bland and forgettable. Too bad because the interior is actually quite nice. Looking forward to something better moving in."}
{"text":"Bricco does well with entrees. The pizzas are very good. I enjoyed shrimp and scallops with a beet salad. Their bread and desserts are lacking. I ordered what I thought would be pear cobbler. It was a pear that was not cooked enough (it was hard) served with some crumbs of whatever. I was not impressed. So we sent that back and ordered some sort of apple spice cake. It was so sweet it made my teeth hurt, but I did not send it back. I was not impressed. The service, however, was very good even though it was a busy Saturday night.  I will return but I won't order dessert."}
{"text":"The place across the street 19.10 can deliver food faster. We waited past 19 minutes and 10 seconds for just a drink. Pass on this place."}
{"text":"I don't often give 5 stars, but this place did nothing to lose any stars for me. Service was quick and the servers were super friendly. I had the steak and it was really well cooked and very tasty. All in all a really nice night."}
{"text":"The food has been going downhill for a while, but I kept giving the place another chance.  No more.  Had a Mediterranean penne pasta dish with white sauce that was totally tasteless.  No, it did taste like paste.  Never again"}
{"text":"It appears as if Bricco is having problems. From the start noticed the menus were stained and dog eared. Trying to order an entrée one finds meager offerings that is if you don't want pasta or pizza. The duck was fatty and I had to send my steak back 3 times before they got it right. Very thin piece of meat and tough. The vegetables were undercooked. Nothing like an almost raw Brussel sprout. The presentation was sloppy and finally when we asked why we didn't get any bread we were told we had to ask for it. Well we were never told that was an option. What was once a good eatery seems to now have problems."}
{"text":"I have been to Bricco twice thus far and I think it's a good addition to the Kent restaurant scene but it didn't exactly meet my expectations.  

Bricco bills itself as an upscale contemporary American-Italian restaurant and based on the highly lauded Akron location I had high hopes.  Every think I've eaten here has been good but not the \"great\" I was expecting.  More specifics if you can stand to read it follows:

Service has been A+ each time.  The first time, the server was obviously new to the profession but very nice and attentive.  The second visit, the server was seasoned, friendly and attentive.  He apologized several times for the wait on our food and (I think) forgot to bring us bread (unless that only comes with pasta) but I didn't care about either of those things so no points taken.


The appetizer BANANA PEPPERS stuffed with italian sausage and chorizo rice was yummy and spicy and a good start to the meal on visit #1. 

For an entree I ordered the \"baked PENNE with italian SAUSAGE, caramelized onions, mozzarella cheese and banana peppers in a PINK SAUCE \" and it was ok but pretty much like any penne with store-bought meat sauce I've ever made at home.  (I clarify because I've had better penne with homemade meat sauce...mmm)  

My date also ordered pasta this visit - going for the \"ANGEL HAIR tossed with BLACKENED CHICKEN, green onions, diced tomatoes and a CAJUN CREAM sauce.\"  I think he liked it and I got to try to and thought it was also just ok.  I wasn't wowed since I think Red Lobster has (had?) a similar dish that tastes exactly the same.  

Visit #2 we tried the tomato and artichoke soup which is the BEST thing I've had here and super recommended.  Chunky, creamy, flavorful and divine with fresh ground black pepper (which they had on the table!!)  For my own future reference, I think this soup + a salad would be a knockout pair.

For an entree I went with the \"WAFFLE-BATTERED AIRLINE CHICKEN breast with white cheddar GRITS and maple butter\" and my date ordered the \"grilled PORK TENDERLOIN with bacon and corned beef HASH and sauteed RAPINI.\"

I love chicken + sweetness of maple syrup or honey and, again, my expectations were not quite met.  The batter was pretty delicious although it tasted more like Funnel Cake than waffle to me and the chicken was pretty tender but pretty bland.  The grits were also fairly bland (although they ended up being my fave part of this meal.)  Portions are generous - I certainly couldn't finish it!

The fella was super impressed by the awesomeness of the bacon & corned beef has which I also thought was super yummy.  The pork seemed a bit dry to me although it was done to the \"medium\" specs requested. 

I'm definitely going to give this place more business as it seems consistently good but I guess I was looking for them to wow my taste-buds.  There are certainly better spots in Kent if you are looking for a REALLY spectacular meal but Bricco does have the \"trendy\" factor going for it.  (And a great rotating specialty beer list, though nothing on tap.)"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the second time for dinner. First time wasnt great so we thought we'd give it another chance. Total waste. We ordered the goat cheese appetizer. All it is is goat cheese with a red pepper sauce and pita. The app was pretty good, but took almost 30 minutes to get it. Mind you, this was on a Tuesday. Then I got the crab cakes with rice and cole slaw. The cole slaw was brown and not your typical cole slaw, and the crab cakes were tasteless and mushy. My friend had the veggie stir fry with salmon. She said her fish was overcooked and the dish was bland. Its not a super cheap restaurant, so for my half of the app, crab cakes and a drink it was $42 with tip. Definitely wasnt worth it, and definitely wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"Great for brunch on the weekends! Decent sized portions and delicious Bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"I am not one to complain about something or a business publicly, however for my birthday my family went to Bricco in Kent. I NEVER order alcohol but thought I would for my birthday, the drink was not good, I think it was made wrong because it was so bitter and everyone at the table agreed. I told the waiter and he took it and had them add more simple syrup...it still was bad. The waitress said there was nothing they could do about it. No remake, no taking off the bill nothing. My family told her it was my birthday and by the end she said \"do you even still want a desert\" I was so put off I just wanted to leave. The bartender told my mom she thought something was wrong with the drink, he told her they made it right and it was my problem. He also said their fine print says if you don't like the drink they don't have to remake or replace. So even if they \"accidentally\" made it wrong. 

They were so very rude and it wasn't a cheap meal. Truly dissapointed because I spend everyday trying to be good at customer service, even if it doesn't benifit me.

{"text":"Bricco is a good option for a decent dinner out - it feels a little bit on the nicer side, but it's not necessarily expensive. The atmosphere is bright & casual, with friendly if not always speedy service, & they have a lot of tasty cocktails on the menu, in addition to all their wines & beers. 

Their menu features a few quirky options, like risotto balls stuffed with smoked bacon & mozzarella, or bacon-wrapped scallops. And I'm not a spinach girl, but their spinach salad is awesome: baby spinach, butternut squash, dried fruits, pumpkin seeds, white cheddar, & apple cider vinaigrette. There are a ton of pizza & pasta options... something for everyone, basically, & I'm always pleased with the food.

I have generally found the servers here to be extra-nice, but I've had repeated negative interactions with one guy who must be the manager. Once, I called to see if I could make a reservation for the same evening & was told that \"That's not how reservations work\" because it was the same day (it is in the city I had just moved here from, my bad), & another time, when I went in & asked how long the wait would be, he said, \"Whenever a table opens up.\" Dude, hosts are regularly in the business of estimating wait times, so how about you at least try? More than once, I've seen employees give customers (myself included) a sympathetic or apologetic glance in an attempt to make up for the manager's rudeness.

I feel bad marking down an entire restaurant for one bad manager, but my negative experiences with him have been, as I said, repeated, & it makes me question the place on the whole. Maybe I'll change this review whenever he finally leaves? In the meantime, I'll stick to the Akron location."}
{"text":"Well I am updating my review. We had eaten here a few months ago while in Kent. Our food was good the first time! The second time I ordered pizza and it was not good at all! Several people in our party had cold meals served to them. The mixed drinks were great though."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late dinner after a conference across the street. This restaurant is a great addition to Kent. The service was prompt and friendly and we had a great visit. They have a huge wine list and a decent variety of entrees and appetizers. The risotto balls were indeed excellent. I had one of the many pasta entrees which was nothing exceptional, but good. Everyone else in our party seemed satisfied with their meals as well."}
{"text":"I got the Cajun chicken pasta. I went alone and the staff treated me wonderfully! They were quick to helping me, but it didn't feel pushy. I also ordered this drink that was half framboise lambic and half Guinness. Interesting beverage that was very refreshing. Probably wouldn't order with a chicken dish again, needs to be with something more meaty like a burger. Restaurant was very clean and a nice getaway from campus food."}
{"text":"We discovered this restaurant while visiting the Akron area for a gymnastics meet. The food was good overall, ambiance was nice, and the service was friendly and accommodating. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. My friend was so excited for is to come here for our birthday celebrations. She ordered Cajun chicken and it was totally bland. It looked like it only had olive oil on the spaghetti. And the chicken was dry and charred. I got the salmon and it came out raw in the center and atop soggy, flavorless risotto. I asked the kitchen to cook it further and they brought me back the one I had originally, after I had it into it and poked around. My friend had asked for a new piece of chicken and our server, who was very nice, brought a whole new bowl of pasta. This time it was on FIRE. Almost as if the cook was offended and out to prove a point. It burned and was full of dark spices. The color was totally different from the first one. Like two completely different dishes. It's a shame, this place has a great ambience and location. They really need some new cooks."}
{"text":"The worst service and Managment. My first experience but my wife and co-workers have been before and this is the same story. No manager to the table to explain the issue or offer an apology not an apology from the server either. Well over 1.5 and no pizza or the salad. Just plain terrible. I would give no stars if I could. 

Beware and be warned."}
{"text":"Bricco was very accommodating for our group of 7 when we didn't have reservations. Our waitress was so nice I wish i would've caught her name!! Drinks were great, I had the pear martini. Ahi tuna wontons were a great appetizer but there's only two of them so if you're splitting order more! Goat cheese marinara is always good to share. I had a salad and I wish i would've gotten something a bit more hearty. (they also have gluten free pasta!!!)"}
{"text":"Last week I ordered food to go and I got the fulL- wedge salad. I get home and get ready to eat the salad and there was the tiniest amount of lettuce rhay wouldn't  even satisfy a tiny rabbit. I have got the wedge salad many times from the Akron Bricco and was amazed by the amount of lettuce which made the wedge my favorite. A few weeks earlier I got a pizza to go. I live 3 miles away by the time I got home the pizza was completely wet and soggy and i didn't even eat it. I loved Bricco when I lived in akron. I believe the GM and staff need to be sent to akron to receive training. THIS PLACE CAN DO BETTER! There were several other things that were not right when I dined in as well. I'm willing to give this place ONE more try due to how close I live. One more bad experience and I'm just going to make the trip to akron."}
{"text":"Positives:

- The Martinis!! There are so many to try and they are all delicious! You get a very generous amount of liquor and the quality is outstanding! I highly recommend their espresso martini!

- the atmosphere. It feels more upscale then most bars in Kent, and is never too crowded to enjoy yourself. The 8 dollar martinis keep the typical portage county \"dollar beer\" crowd out, so you can enjoy a business casual drink without all the screaming and buffoonery.

- The cleanliness. From the concrete counters to the linen tablecloths, to the restrooms, everything is very cleanly and well taken care of.

- The location and the patio. Right in the heart of downtown, and the patio is nice in the summer to have a cocktail and an appetizer outside.

The negatives:

- The food there isn't nearly as good as the drinks. They have a few good apps, but overall I like just sticking to the drinks.

- The bartender guys are not always on their game. Sometimes it seems like they are more concerned with doing their tasks and cleaning than they actually are concerned with tending bar. I have had a number of different times where my drink has been empty quite a while before I can flag one of them down, even when it's not that busy.


***UPDATE- the management took the feedback to heart and have drastically improved their food! Both the regular menu and bar menu are great! And the service has definitely improved! I have updated to 5 Star. This is absolutely a favorite in Kent."}
{"text":"The food was very good; my wife ordered the sirloin steak, I ordered the seared tuna. The service was excellent, and the tortilla & bean dip was great. Although they were pretty nice, the only thing I didn't like was the high stainless steel tables and concrete floors. They felt a little cheap to me. I would definitely prefer an environment with carpeting and booths especially for the price of the dinners."}
{"text":"As my friends and I say, Bricco is the move! This is my favorite spot in Kent to get appetizers and drinks or a nice dinner.

This is one of the classier restaurants in downtown Kent, and a nice place to go for a girls night out or for a date. If I'm getting appetizers and drinks, I love the goat cheese and tomato with pita bread. They give you so much, it honestly is enough for a meal! I also love the pink elephant drink, super sweet! When I come here for dinner, I love getting the white pizza."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at the high rating this place has.  I am from Texas and stopped here because it was the only place open after 10pm on a Tuesday.  I'm one of 5
People here, the server has come to my table twice in an hour, water is empty, the steak pizza has excellent ingredients but is absolutely TASTELESS!   I had to put salt and pepper just so I can taste the pizza.  The sangria martini is all cheap red wine and nothing else.  Service is poor and slow.  Super super disappointing.  I'm a literally already nauseous and haven't even received my check or seen my waiter in 30 minutes (it's 11pm and I'm one of 3 people in here now).  Waste of money."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our evening at Bricco. Our waitress was attentive and helpful with recommendations. 

The pizzas were phenomenal. We got the pulled pork and the chorizo sausage pizzas. They were a good size, not the tiny personal pizzas other restaurants serve. 

My only complaint is the calamari could have been better. I just prefer it more crispy."}
{"text":"The pesto chicken pizza and Mac n cheese was soooooo good. Worth the long wait. Not the greatest service. Not bad in price though."}
{"text":"My husband & I have visited the Bricco location in the valley & were very surprised at the difference in atmosphere when we walked into the new Kent location. For starters, it is aimed at being more upscale (which makes sense due to all the local businesses) and not as relaxing or cozy as the valley. I do love the Chihuly-like art that hung from the entrance ceiling & the beautiful color palette on the walls. Yet I couldn't help but feel a little out of place, mainly because I thought it was more casual than it is.

Sadly, it is also more expensive!!! And  does not offer the same menu; leaving me a little disappointed that I couldn't fulfill my cheddar/beer soup craving. So I tried their risotto balls instead- they had a great crispy shells and the way they were displayed was almost too pretty to eat. Yet they weren't great, it's something I would order again but not go out of my way to have. 
I also ate the BBQ pulled pork pizza, again, it wasn't bad but not great. It could've really used more BBQ sauce & the potatoes could ave been cooked longer. I will include that our server, Ashley, was extremely friendly, fun & fast. 

So in conclusion, if you're on a budget this probably isn't the best place to explore...and if you are on a gluten-free diet they only offered two items on their menu :/ Also, I realize Kent is trying ti build itself up (and their doing a great job) but I fail to see any of the newer local businesses cater to a college students wallet."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced!! I got the mac and cheese with chicken and it cost $17.00 and it made me feel sick!! It was one of the saltiest dishes I've ever eaten. Not worth the price at all!! I thought this place was supposed to be the \"fancy place in Kent!!\" It's just a bigger Panini's. Very disappointed and so is my wallet. Think again people."}
{"text":"The half wedge salad was the highlight of our visit. Stuffed banana peppers were okay. Porterhouse steak was unremarkable. My wife didn't enjoy the calamari as much as a previous visit. This time heavy and dense compared to light and crispy before."}
{"text":"We WERE regulars. Tonight the menu changed and now there are no basic pastas on the menu. How does an Italian based restaurant have no meat sauce options? The wait staff was uncaring tonight. We'll find somewhere else for our pasta."}
{"text":"We had a good time, the service was great and very accodimating for a large group (9). The food was good and served in a timely fashion. They didn't rush us out the door either when we wanted to sit and talk for awhile."}
{"text":"Went last night with my girlfriend and it was a great experience wait staff was friendly and professional, and did very well at explaining the menu. I had the shrimp and scallops and they were very satisfying. Great flavor and perfect portion sizes, a Kent must!"}
{"text":"We ate here during the Harry Potter festival. Ordered the risotto balls, calemari and chicken salad sandwich. Everything was great. Waitress was attentive and kept us with cold drinks. The tab for 3 with 3 glasses of wine and tip came in at $50.00. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I will start with something nice - the restaurant looked pretty and the tomato and artichoke soup was pretty good. 

Unfortunately we had a horrible experience. Our server was in charge of our table of 12 plus another large party. The other server was supposed to be helping both tables as well, but we didn't see him once. The female only seemed to come over when she had a free minute after taking care of the other party, we didn't see her much. Drinks and water remained empty and we often felt forgotten about. 

We arrived at 7, the birthday girl at 7:15. We ordered around 8. Cold bread came out around 8:15. Our appetizers/soup at 8:45. It was 45 more minutes before our cold food came out with no explanation. The sandwich bread was rock hard, meat was room temperature, as were the fries. My salad was room temperature and limp. No apologies at that point and this disgusting food was served to us. 

At about 10:15 the cake was served. The cake was ok, but different. It was very dense instead of moist and fluffy. The frosting was pretty good. We all sat around for 25 minutes after that just waiting for our checks. 

We arrived at 7 and didn't leave until 10:50, we expected to be there until 9 at the latest and four hours is ridiculous, especially when we got there before MANY other people yet we were one of the last tables there. The other large party of at least 20, that got there AFTER US left an hour before we did! They also had cake/celebrations. The manager comped 2 of our tables meals, but never came over to apologize. 

Our server got snippy with us once we finally complained and she just said how busy it was, she wasn't very nice. (and we were not rude to her whatsoever, even while complaining) I'm sorry, I have gone to a number of busy establishments that still have impeccable service and food. 

On the way out I spoke with the manager. He kept saying he was sorry over and over. He said this was the busiest they have ever been, but even still, how were we the only table completely forgotten about?? The place was almost empty when we left. We will NEVER go back there again. This establishment needs to shape up or ship out."}
