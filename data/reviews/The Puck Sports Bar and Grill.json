{"text":"In for a beer and watch Jays game today.  Staff lacked enthusiasm and generally exuded a willingness to be anywhere but here. BLT wrap and fries was decent. Wings were over sauced and too much sugar for medium BBQ sauce.  Slow service getting drinks. No table clearing long after meal was finished. Not sure what else is in the hood but I'd suggest a walk on by to look for something better."}
{"text":"I went to try the chicken wings here cause I heard they are good. I tried a dry spice for my wings. They ended up having hair on them. The wings are big but for taste I've had better. I was disappointed and lost my appetite. Service was also pretty slow and the waiter did not seem to care that much."}
{"text":"Starting off fine.  Service was immediate and friendly.  Ordered wings and a hot popper app.  Sporty and clean.  A good compromise between myself and my partner but still would like some music! Geez men and thier sports bars."}
{"text":"Great spot to go for a bite to eat. My husband and I walked in and then out to a few different places along Bloor street before we came across this place. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. The food was fantastic, the Angus burger I would highly recommend they did a great job. Our meals were great and the atmosphere was really good there. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's definitely your average sports bar. The food was good but not amazing. I would certainly not be opposed to coming here again if my friends wanted to, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come. I got the chicken tenders and they were pretty good. We also got the starter combo platter and it was sort of bland... and so much fried food in one place... The blade fries are really good though and waitress was also very nice :)"}
{"text":"do no bother. I have to say that the service was really good however the food was dissapointing.  The fries are just plain gross. My girlfriend had the puck burger...and thats exactly what it was a puck between two slices of bread. I had some wings. I took the cajun dry rub which is suppose to be their hottest...rated at 3 flames..it was not spicy at all!!! The wings were alright but you can't put on the menu \"our hottest dry rub\" when it's not spicy."}
{"text":"I've never went there before, but I've seen the other couple bad reviews here. I don't know about what it used to be, but I liked what I saw.  I ordered the combo, wings + half ribs and 2 cokes, me and my wife were satisfied with the taste and amount of food.  A lot of TV's so you can watch the sports. It was a Sunday Baseball, Hockey and Football was on.  There was this one guy that was screaming at the game and one of the waitress came and told him to stop yelling and stop bothering other people. He then waited 5 minutes more, took a last sip and left screaming at the players.  At the end of the night, I had a good experience. Of course the waitresses could use a little smile, but that's not the end of the world for me. When I asked for suggestions, she was more then prepared to give me some good ones and was prepared for my questions regarding the sauces.  I would go back, yeah."}
{"text":"I love this place, the service and the food are good, excellent to watch sports.   the beer is good and your food is cheap, it is a comfortable and relaxed place to be with friends."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place...food has gotten worse (what happened to their buffalo chicken wrap? It used to be so good!), service is some of the slowest I've ever experienced. Definitly not worth it."}
{"text":"Cheap eats, pretty standard bar menu with vegan options. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Always had an awesome time here. Best wings ever in big portions. Servers have always been good and polite. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"For the past two Sundays, I have gone to Puck Sports Bar for Sunday Night Football and wings. After trying a few other places, I have been going there occasionally over the past year since my regular place closed. It's your typical sports bar, 1 large-screen TV at the back and 5-6 smaller TV's by the bar, with music in the background sometimes. I usually sit at the bar, and the service is pretty fast and friendly.  I only recall ordering wings when I have been there, and there are a lot of choices available: various levels of hot, spicy flavours, dry rubs. These past weeks I have had red Thai and creamy dill, and have previously enjoyed a few types of BBQ. On Sundays, the special is a pound of wings with fries and a pint of beer for $15; on Mondays, it is 1/2-priced wings. The wings are pretty good, and the fries a little crisp which I like. I cannot comment on other food, but the menu is fairly broad, and there are food and drink specials every day. There is a selection of starters, of which I mean to try the deep-fried pickle.  Overall, a pretty decent place to have a meal while watching some sports, and conveniently located next to Spadina's west subway exit. The prices are average for a downtown pub, and there's nothing to make the place stand out, but also nothing bad to say about it either, so I'm sure I will return in future."}
{"text":"While I haven't had much else on the menu, I am comfortable saying that these are the best wings I have had in town. Monday night wing night is worth checking out. Any time I go for wings, I go here. Excellent breadth of flavours and never skimpy on serving size."}
{"text":"An amazing pub great food great staff great people all around n by the way good looking girls that  make it even better ..!!"}
{"text":"Had a fun time here watching a Patriots game! It is a pretty average sized sports bar but has potential. When I went they had a half rack ribs and fries for $12 which was an excellent deal! The curly fries are highly recommended! They're served piping hot and make an excellent cheap snack for those nail biting games.   Overall, decent sports bar to visit for cheap food and a chill vibe."}
{"text":"Dont let the reviews fool you, theyre like 2 yrs old.  I come here about once a week, bringing new friends every time, for their big screens and 5.99$ beer specials, but if it wasn't for the friendly, rowdy atmosphere that the guests create whenever there's a game, I would never set foot in here again.  The service here has been consistently terrible unless it's with that one cool chick with the tatted arm, so basically everyone else besides her looks miserable and as if they're theyre counting the seconds before work ends. The last hostess I had prompted me to write this.   Whenever I (finally) flagged her down (you have one job as a waitress. it's to be aware of your surroundings and have decent peripheral vision lol), while im in the middle of asking for another beer or an order of nachos,  she'd walk away before i was even done my order. yea. i get it. youre busy. But please dont make me have to ask you to come back 4 times after that because you were too impatient to hear me out the first time. it's tiring for you, and it's tiring for me.   The rest of the night, she was rude and cold. It was so bad that my friend asked me if I was alright and If i wanted to go to another bar. We came to the conclusion that she was either racists or she JuST HaD A BaD DaY   There's a lot more I want to say/ complain about but I wont because I'm sure she (and every other server 90% of the time) just had a bad day, so I'll end this with a quote from my sister: \"Can you order my milkshake for me, she's so mean\"    TL;DR: Amazing place to watch the Raptors, Leafs, etc, game, just fingers crossed you dont end up with a server that makes u want to cry/ shoot yourself in the face :)"}
{"text":"I've been a constant client in this place. Going at least 3 or 4 times per month on Monday as they had a good promo. However, after the new management came in and quit the original franchise (Puck n'Wings), the quality of the place has going down terribly. Wings are smaller, the ones that have sauce have less sauce (the fun part of this is that some of the flavors that are on the menu are no longer available as they are not part of the franchise), booze is expensive (as usual, but at least it was tolerable with good wings) and the service is so so. What happen? who knows, but they lost a customer with me."}
{"text":"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers, I wouldn't bother going here. For what the food was, it was over priced. I got the chicken wrap, which had very little meat and almost no lettuce or tomatoes. The majority of my wrap, was the tortilla itself. The fries were clearly from a bag, and not done in house. Only positive thing I can say is that the fountain drinks were large, and a fair price (especially with yesterday's heat!). The overall quality of the food was a resounding \"meh\"."}
{"text":"This is a late review, but I arranged an office get together last year and had a great time!  So we are booking it again this year!  A little short staffed, but they made the best of dealing with a large group.  Wings are great!  See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of a similar establishment, Puck 'N Wings in North York, I visited The Puck expecting an \"unofficial Puck 'N Wings\" as I think this restaurant used to be one at some point in its lifespan. It features a similar menu, however at a fraction of the quality. The wings were just poorly made and very blah overall compared to the same flavours I've had at Puck 'N Wings. I had the dry cajun and my personal favourite flavour, the Great One. Normally a saucy wing, the Great One here was pretty dry on the exterior and interior. The fries that come with the meal were decent, somewhat similar to the fries at St. Louis so those weren't so bad.   The Puck is really just a place to meet up with friends, have some drinks and watch a game at almost any angle thanks to the numerous televisions throughout the restaurant. If your hungry, they happen to have a kitchen that makes serviceable food if your not looking to be impressed. This bar fills the role of a sports bar with good service, but just don't visit expecting top tier wings to eat as you watch a game."}
