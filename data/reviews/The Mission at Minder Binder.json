{"text":"I believe they are now called San-Tan at Minder Binder.  This is still a good place - for a non-drinker, I always feel comfortable.  But they recently changed their menu drastically, and it went from a slightly funky place with cool pizzas and other unique twists on \"bar food\" to a place with basic bar food.  They have \"steak house\" signs up but not much steak on the menu, just the usual burgers, apps, salads, etc.  I loved their pizzas and variety, but that's gone ,so it's just an average food place now in terms of selection or variety.  Food tastes good, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Great burger black and bleu  Fries good but not fresh cut Shrimp cocktail excellent and great homemade horseradish  Ice cream sandwich cheap at $3 not bad but straight from the box nothing special Service and burger both excellent"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Went for the first time today, beautiful patio and very rad decorations inside. Server had great recommendations, I settled on the Scarborough fair pizza. YUM! Was quiet when I went in but loved the atmosphere. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The last time I was at Minder Binder was about 15 years ago! I wasn't even old enough to drink yet. I remembered all the cool stuff inside and that the burger I had was decent enough...  I now live right around the corner from the NEW Mission at Minder Binder, and finally went in to try it out today. Very nice reboot! They kept all the good stuff and changed all the dingy old dirty stuff. I sat at the bar and both bartenders were friendly and attentive. The patio looks sooo nice! I am always in search of a good house-made veggie burger, and this one is very filling and delicious! (A bit of a kick to it, which I like!) I will definitely be back. Next time I'll have to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Don't go if you have kids, they don't have high chairs and don't plan to in the future. Food was pretty good, building was cool, but the hostess, waiter and apparently management made it clear that they didn't want it to be a place where you'd bring kids. It seems like they would want families to come given that they were 90% empty on a Tuesday for lunch."}
{"text":"Kudos to the Minder Binder savers who preserved the wonderful aspects of the historic Minder Binders, but scrubbed it up so nicely!!  It is better than ever!  All the employees are extremely friendly and the food is very good and reasonably priced.  It would be so nice to have a few more vegetarian options.  Offering a veggie patty in lieu of the meat on the burger choices would be tremendous!  That little change would bring me, and other vegetarians, back more frequently.  Even though the veggie pizza and the fun salad are delicious, I can only repeat them a limited number of times.  Great fun though!"}
{"text":"Wow!.. This place is beautiful.  They did a great job on the building the patio and the original Minder Binders. Maybe they are not officially open yet or something but...... No servers on this beautiful patio?. Not sure why they would do that. And not to mention the fact there is only about two tables on the patio right now. And $4 for a can of Miller Light?..that is crazy!. I will have to stick with Four Peaks they know how to do it right. I won't be coming back to the New Minder Binders. Sorry"}
{"text":"Horrible service. It's supposed to be a family owned business, but from what I saw it seemed like none of the workers liked each other. How are we supposed to like the restaurant if the workers don't even want to be there? We left feeling uncomfortable, not going here again."}
{"text":"Food, great. Atmosphere, great. This place has a simple menu that can please everyone. The only thing I have to comment on is the service could use a little work... The bartender is solid, though. And sometimes the lighting makes me feel like I'm being interrogated (it's a little dark and creepy). Other than that, get the deviled eggs & pineapple bacon pizza"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, which is deceiving from the outside. The staff was very friendly and attentive, but the menu was a little disappointing. They have plenty of burgers or pizzas, but not much else. Definitely not a lot of options if you're looking to eat a little healthier. That being said, I tried the mesquite chicken sandwich (it was the only non-beef sandwich), and it was delicious. The sweet potato fries were made perfectly...not too soggy, not too crunchy."}
{"text":"Pizza is a staple where I am from. I also grew up with a family who owned and operated pizza places and still does. This place knows pizza. The Mahalo pizza was phenomenal. Even better was the staff. Great place that is still yet to be discovered. Christy the owner was awesome as well. Good luck to them i will definitely be back if work permits me to"}
{"text":"Had lunch today with a buddy and it was like we were in a time warp...the good kind where everything is better.  The wings were great.  The food and service were as well and the new shaded patio is awesome.  Great beer selection.  Relive your college days at this icon...and remember them this time around!"}
{"text":"Awesome decor and great service! Only thing keeping this from being a five star review is that the food wasn't anything to write home about. Managed to sample several different dishes from the groups plates, and I'd say the best thing would have to have been the wings, but again, nothing special. Go for the decor, drinks, experience, and music and maybe grab dinner elsewhere beforehand :)"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to burger place. Loved it. Ownership changed and a new concept is in - and they got rid of pizza, which was the best thing on their menu! Still love their cheese curds but will have to find a different go-to place."}
{"text":"I went to this place to hang out with some friends casually. Their pizza was delicious and I loved their Moscow mule. It started raining outside so we went in. Inside is a bit dinky, but it goes with all the crazy, vintage decor. They provide heaters outside. I thought their fountain in the middle of the courtyard was very cute."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with the new and improved Minder Binders! The original knick nacks and charm are intact and the property improvements are exceptional. The modern looking kitchen kicks out food quickly and the bar is much much nicer. The 2 patio areas are a nice touch. I've brought several guests on 5-6 visits. Each experience has been a great time. The owner Chritine (Christy?) goes out of her way to remember your name and greet us every time and often serves your drinks or meal herself when the help is busy. She is obviously a hard worker and strong on customer appreciation. I believe she will be very successful. The burgers are great. I understand they are adding more menu items like salmon so I look forward some healthy choices, however the pizza looks so good I will try that next! If you remember the old place you wont be disappointed. I live about 12 miles away but it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific lunch!  Thanks so much for bringing Minder Binder's barn back in all it's glory....and the food was great too!  The chipotle mayo on the Mesquite Chicken was terrific!  Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is unmatched. Food menu has room for improvement (although, Frank, the chef, make us a Bruschetta that was one of the best I've ever had). They are new so I am sure they are still working out menu items so I will give them 5 stars for those reasons."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place! It makes me so happy that they use a 140 year old sourdough starter for their pizza dough. This is exceptionally hard to come across especially for a pizza. The crust comes out perfectly. I had the Scarborough fair which is their signature pizza and for a reason because the toppings are on point. They are keeping it real here."}
{"text":"Worst service and food ever.  Aesthetics are good, but forget about it.  Horrible customer service and Managers are even worse than their employees.  Don't go there."}
{"text":"First time here, it was between lunch and dinner so not busy! The wings were amazing, Cobb salad was standard Cobb fare but everything was fresh and crisp and the dressing VERY good! But the best part of the experience was the customer service! Everyone was friendly, checked on us and was sincere! To me, customer service is the most important aspect of any business experience! They get 5 stars for the food and service! Obvious the owner takes great pride in every aspect of your dining experience!"}
{"text":"I had a birthday lunch there today for five of my staff. Our bill with tip totalled $102.67. They brought me a cheeseburger back and it was raw inside. I spoke to the manager and asked for my $8.95 burger to be credited on my credit card. She wanted me to bring the burger back which was inconvenient. Most companies would do the right thing and just credit my card. They will be losing not only the six of us as customers, but all of our staff aas I plan on telling them about our experience. This is a very unfortunate situation over $8.95. Her answer for not refunding me was it is the cook needs to see it as an educational opportunity. I think the $8.95 refund is worth refunding over a one star review on Google. As a business owner I would have taken care of the customer. Nicole Mertens Owner Digital Art Solutions Tempe, Arizona"}
{"text":"The new owners have done a fantastic job of saving the memory of this classically weird Tempe hangout.  The main 'barn' retains all the kitschy crap that made Minders so different (and somehow they cleaned off 40 years' worth of dust the stuff had accumulated).  The rest of the property has been modernized with new bar areas, two nice patios, more bathrooms (yea!) and a 2-story buffer between McClintock road.   Bummer tho - no more sand volleyball!  This is clearly a labor of love for the new owners!  I spent a whole beer just wandering around, remembering the old, and checking out the new.   The place has lots of areas still under construction during the daytime, and therefore only opens at 4:00.  They only opened on the 18th of October, so some of the staff aren't quite up to speed, and the service wasn't great.  I expect that'll change once they're 'officially' open."}
{"text":"The food is so good, hot and comes out quit. That would be enough for me, but the service is AMAZING. The staff is amazingly friendly. Everyone waits on you. The manager, the servers, busers, everyone. Love this place. Great food great service."}
{"text":"I love this place. I haven't been in the cooler months  yet but I'm excited to check out the outside area very soon! As for the inside it's really dark and fun inside. The dinner salad is great with cranberries and blue cheese crumbles. I love their wings and they are the reason I go there....maybe someday I'll try something else in the menu. Lol"}
{"text":"The Mission @ Minder Binders is new and improved! They have an amazing food menu ( The pizza's specifically!) , and the staff is Friendly and Helpful. The patio is spectacular, and there's tons of things to see. A must see spot!"}
{"text":"Very ordinary...burgers and drinks very pedestrian. Also, our party of 6 finished our meals prior to the other two being served the pizza they ordered. Frankly, no reason to return when there are so many great spots in Tempe/Scottsdale/Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Burger Madness back in business at Mission @ Minder Binders, went there this week what a blast, great food and craft beer on tap. Good fast pleasant service. Still has all the old with a splash of new. Great beer prices.  Thanks for bringing Minder Binders back to life.  Larry"}
{"text":"I have been here on two occasions and both times I have been impressed with the restaurant's cleanliness, quality of customer service, and the great food. Servers are friendly and the service is really quick! I suggest the Sweet T (peach whiskey and black tea). The interior has so many fun things to look at."}
{"text":"At first glance this place seemed to have lots of history and I knew my parents used to eat here which was a part of the allure. The food was unexcusably awful. We started with the deviled eggs which were simply boiled eggs cut in half with onions and bacon bits. They were gross and definitely not restaurant worthy. We shared the Swiss alps burger which tasted fine, not great, with un-melted Swiss cheese and with bacon gone terribly bad ( how do you mess up bacon???). Then, to top of the evening, our table light went off and we sat in the dark for the remaining part of our dinner. The waiter came and left with no apologies, no comps and pretty much continued the level of service he gave us all night."}
{"text":"I finally got to check this place out last night. It is so beautiful, I couldn't believe it. So much love, care and pride have gone in to this renovation. The patio is like a resort with a fire pit and a lovely, big fountain.  The inside is just so quirky and fun. Definitely bringing some class and history to the tempe area. Great date place where you can acually hear people at your table talk. Beer was cold, pizza was very yummy and original and the service was great. The best part is watching all the old regulars pop in and take pictures of their old favorite place. This place is a little far from my neighborhood but, no matter. I will surely be back soon."}
{"text":"Very casual menu but the ambiance was so nice!!! It's like a barn with movie paraphernalia all over. There's a bar inside and outside. Definitely worth a visit and prices were decent."}
{"text":"What a flash to the past.  I had no idea that they were going to keep everything that was in the original Minderbinders.  What an awesome job they have done with everything.  The food is exceptional.  Even better than before. Going back soon!"}
{"text":"first time in, staff was friendly and the owner dale is awesome! super friendly and genuine. this place is a 5 minute walk from home, I'll be back time and again. thanks for the southern comfort chicken tenders :)"}
{"text":"A perfect place to hang out!! It has a fabulous decoration with couple of mysterious corners to discover!! :) their beer is good but a little bit expensive. A friendly environment which serve you well."}
{"text":"Wow, stellar service, friendly staff, the best food, I love this place! Great job everyone! My first time back since the re-open and I cannot believe how rad this place is!!! Its a must! Come and eat and you wil see what I mean! Megan is a great bartender and is very welcoming. ...highly recommend minder binders!!!"}
{"text":"Skip the hostess station. Didn't seem to care if we stayed or not. Sat at the bar. Staff was great, friendly!  Will come back for food, pizza and burger were really good."}
{"text":"MINDER BINDERS is BACK!  They have cleaned up the memorabilia and kept the look and feel of the old place, added a porch and a patio(smoking allowed) with heaters.  The menu is basically salads, hamburgers, and pizza.  We ordered the bacon cheese burger.  The bacon seems to be smoked in individual slices which lends an amazing flavor addition.  The buns are buttered and grilled.  The burger - Hand Formed!!  Unlike Burger Therapy, the burger was tender and juicy when I bit down into it.  I could taste the grilled buttery bun even after I had added all the squeezable accompaniments!  If the other menu items are prepared with as much attention as the burgers, nothing will be disappointing.  WELCOME BACK to life Minder Binders!!"}
{"text":"Great Service! Friendly people. Plenty cold beer choices! 10 cent first Mimosa and very good Bloody Mary bar!"}
{"text":"This is a great place! The food is good, the bartenders are super nice, the atmosphere is great -- very Arizona feel, and there is so much room to have huge groups, privacy, whatever! I would love to see this place hopping. I'm sure the new mission @ minder binder is nothing like the old, so if you haven't been here recently, i think you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I've only been here once since reopening, and I won't be back. The manager, host, and entire staff were extremely rude and unable to work with us to seat a large group (12) of our extended family for lunch on a Sunday. We made very simple requests of how to split up the adults and children at different tables, yet with the restaurant empty, they were still stubborn and unaccommodating. Sounds like it's become the new norm. We stayed for a round of drinks and left."}
{"text":"Excellent food and beverages. Fast service. A variety of craft beer on tap. Great job on the remodel with perfect additions-outdoor patio and grills."}
{"text":"My first time here a few weekends ago, and I was very impressed!!! My fiance and I sat at the bar, I had about 3 drinks (I'm a lush lol) and fiance had 2 probably.. who really knows? Not me ;) Anyway, we also ordered the margherita pizza. It came out fast and was delicious.  One thing that I feel that I need to write about is how friendly, accommodating, and attentive the bartenders were. I honestly hardly ever have service that great sitting at a bar! I was very impressed. They even waved goodbye to us as we left. Because of this experience, I would recommend this place to friends or family if they are in the area. Keep up the good work!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Second time here... excellent food and drinks... atmosphere is relaxing. . Just had the chicken sandwich and fries.. very impressed. . Amy was my server... very attentive.. checking on me to make sure everything is great.. was same quality of service from the first time.. will be a repeat customer. ."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday evening & the staff was quick to help but the place was sadly dead. The overhaul was pretty extensive but the place was still recognizable from the previous Minder Binders which was really nice for the nostalgia. The food menu didn't look great & I mistakenly ordered a foo foo chick drink which I rarely do (a pina colada) that was so, so lacking on the frozen end it was border line warm from over blending. Also it was Tempe priced in a shallow margarita glass. Hook me up with a hurricane glass full of frozen goodness & that's a Pina Colada. What I got was just sad.  Hubs got a beer which was cold & what he ordered. Next time I will do the same.  At the old Minder Binders I would have only dreamed of getting a beer. I should have stuck to that thought process  but with the fancy bathrooms & extensive overhaul I thought hey let's be fancy.  Gotta try again for nostalgia's sake & order a burger & beer like the good ol' days & see how it goes. But right now I'm afraid to say it's like putting lipstick on a pig. :("}
{"text":"Ok I eat out a lot.... this place is great. Been twice in the past two days, beet salad is the best. The Burgers and Steaks are delicious. Now the fun part, the decor is out of the wacky 70's like St James Infirmary from the SF Bay Area. I can't wait to bring my 90 year old parents, it will bring them back to the day that they partied hard like I do now. Thank God for UBER."}
{"text":"This took me all the way back to San Tan Valley! I was so excited when we moved to Tempe and found San Tan Flat at Minder Binder. Food is great! The atmosphere is pretty cool if you want to enjoy a nice cold beer with a country-chic theme. It's definitely going to be a great place where we will be attending. Our server was forgetful but other than that we had a great time! Family friendly as well. Our children loved it!"}
{"text":"The decor here is definitely a highlight! The food is good, had the peanut butter burger and was thoroughly surprised! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I can't believe they brought back the old Minder Binders!  If you were of (or close to) drinking age in the 70's, 80's or early 90's in Tempe then you remember this place!  Great mix of the old and some new."}
{"text":"Service sucks, prices are WAY too high and everyone that works there seems confused. 3.25 for an ICED TEA, REALLY?!?! That said, place is very cool, burgers and Cobb Salad are very tasty. Not quite sure what they will do on the AMAZING patio in the summer, to keep folks cool, but hopefully all the employees will be less confused by then!"}
{"text":"My wife and I split a pizza and the ribs.  Both were excellent.  Why all the margaritas on the menu are made m with Cuervo, they will make them with 1800 or Patron.  One ice thing is that the original tables are still in the barn. One disappointment is that they do not take American Express."}
{"text":"Once again another hidden gem in Tempe.  My friend suggested going here for lunch, and telling us stories of coming here before it closed many years ago.  The decoration is definitely eclectic and there is a lot of it to see.  The server was more than on the ball, my drink barely got down 1 sip before it was refilled.  the burger was pretty good, i ordered a regular burger and fries.   This place has been recently remodeled and has a huge patio / bar area in addition to the large inside dining area.  I can only imagine this is a great place to have a party and have some drinks."}
{"text":"This place just lacks anything special. Calling the menu basic is an understatement. Everything we ordered was average at best. When you eat less than half of your meal and then go directly to Taco Bell afterwards says something pretty strong about the eating experience. The outside patio is great but from there it is all downhill."}
{"text":"I'll try not to use the word \"fantastic\" as often as I'd like, but there's really no way around it. This place is...wait for it...AWESOME! (what did you THINK I would say?) The burgers are incredibly juicy and delicious with a lightly crispy buttered bun. The sweet potato fries even had POWDERED SUGAR on them - just perfect. The barbecue sauce is some of the best I've ever tasted, and the service is top-notch. Even the music is chosen so well, from \"My Girl\" to \"Hotel California\" to current music with about 15 minutes in between. Not to mention the deep history and restoration of which inside that building. We walked around exploring it for about 20 minutes after dinner.  Stop wondering where you want to eat and just GO HERE! You will not regret it :-)"}
{"text":"Went in last night with my girlfriend for a drink. It was our first time there and we had always wanted to check it out. So, we went into the bar and have the bartender our orders. My gf had a Hefewizen and I had an Old Fashioned. The bartender asked if I wanted the house rye and I said that was fine. Next thing see is the bartender building my drink in a shaker and then shaking it. I asked why she shook my drink instead of stirring it like it should be and her reply was 'that's how we do it here'. From that point on, she was very distant. The drink was OK. I just wanted to talk a little shop with her as I use to bartend and was trained differently and never seen another old fashioned made in a shaker. Oh well. Otherwise, it was a good experience. The pizza menu looked great and I am looking forward to going back to try that."}
{"text":"I used to go to Minder Binders before they closed. I am equally impressed with the new opening. CHERI is an awesome bartender! The wings weren't the best, but Cheri more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Loved this place in college and love it even more now. Customer service has come a long way. Breaded shrimp prawns are the bomb. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Fun place, good food and location. Its not just college kids. Theres a mix of business people, happy hour crowds and 20's. It has been hot inside this summer. Need to turn the AC down. Service is ok. Seating inside is limited for parties with more than 4. Patio is great for groups. Live music would make the patio perfect. The top floor is fun - foosball and a hidden bathroom. No drink service up there, even on weekends."}
{"text":"Cool idea for a restraunt, I liked it because every corner was full of different things to look at! Food was alright."}
{"text":"Went tonight to check the place out. After a quick run through the place, I was amazed at how much it looked the same and how much work must have gone into making it that way. We decided to get a table on the patio. We got some drinks and after some friends arrived we ordered some burgers. I would not order them again. Not horrible but not a 10 dollar burger. I guess they had  wings but not sure because they were not on the menu. Who knows what else I could have had that I didn't know about. Go there for the memories not for the food."}
{"text":"I have no idea of the history of this place, but it has one. They also use the same sourdough starter for the pizzas for about 50 years. The waitress explained this too me, but all i know is the pizza turned out pretty good. Our version had giant pieces of pepperoni, a dabble of grilled jalapeno and purple onion. This not really NY style as I was barely able to fold the thing, but it was all about that sourdough crust. In a surprise though, the pizza did not taste good reheated. Another surprise was the \"check in\" on facebook and get an order of chicken tenders for $2. These were small, hot and crunchy little tenders which were quite good. They have an upstairs with games and of course all the funky stuff is fun to check out. Half the patio is covered also, so that is a good thing."}
{"text":"The gal that I took on a date to Binder's in 1973, and returned with me as my wife yesterday, made this trip down Memory Lane enjoyable.  The reproduction of the former dive bar is great.   Granted, we were poor ASU students not using student loans and we only could afford to go here a few times back in the 70s, but it was a blast. The food was decent and the wines are much better than those served in the 70s.  We experienced a problem with the server who did not seem to be up to speed.  Perhaps he was a little green. We will return again & perhaps bring the grandkids."}
{"text":"A shadow of what they were last month. Look at the reviews. Their sourdough pizza is was you see loved up over and over. As of earlier this week, pizza has been completely dropped from the menu. It seems that there has been an ownership / name change and the venue is aiming to be a live music and burger space. But oddly, lobster has been added.   Not good."}
{"text":"I have always heard about this place but frankly the servers were to busy with yakking and doing nothing to ask me what I wanted for lunch so I got up and left and told the hostess that I must not have been important enough to be waited on"}
{"text":"We have mixed reviews about this place.  On one hand they were open at 130 in the am which is awesome and the flavor was good.   But the pizza was seriously lacking toppings and when we picked it up they didn't offer peppers or cheese plates so that was lame!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place more than I do.  My wife and I have been here three times since the opening, and the atmosphere is by far the best part of the experience. Our servers were another bright spot.  The menu is basic, which would be OK if if was really tasty and well executed. To date, we've been completely underwhelmed by the food. Honestly, you'll get better burgers at Denny's, the pizza is heartbreaking as well.    The beer selection is fine, but would I like to see more local stuff.   I really hope the food gets better, because it's a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"5 stars for atmosphere, 5 stars for taste. 1 star for service.  Our waiter was nice and had a great personality, however one of the worst servers I've had in a while.  My husband and I each ordered a beer (It's St Pattys day, so obligatory), and our almost 4 year old an orange juice.  Waters for all three. Received the beers and the OJ which was presented in a pint glass with a straw... for a three year old.  Upon taking our order our son spilled the OJ in front of the waiter and the waiter watched as we franticly tried to mop up the mess, never offering assistance.  We ordered fried pickles, a pizza and a burger with NO avocado aioli. 30 mins went by, still no water, no check in and tables that arrived after us received appetizers.  (It was lunch, and not busy what so ever.)  I finally flagged down our server and asked for waters and a status on the pickles.  Immediately water and pickles arrived, as well as our food.  Pickles were the best fried dills we've had in a while, and pizza was perfect as ordered.  Burger- smothered in avocado aioli with extra avocado on the side.  Husband said it tasted great after he wiped off the dreaded avocado spread (it's a good thing he just doesn't like it and isn't allergic... we'd have problems if he was.)  No ask if we needed anything, no offer of condiments nor were any available at the table.  Waiter checked in once we cleaned our plates and was prompt to bring the check and collect his tip.  Woman who I assume based on pictures is the manager gave us glares each time she walked by, and even served the other tables but not our own.  Not sure what's going on with the employment structure here, but was sadly disappointed that our first visit to a icon for Tempe was run in such a manner.  I have been a Tempe resident for 10 year and the husband well over 20.  We will return, but with the knowledge the service may be sub par.  At least everything tasted great!"}
{"text":"Below average bar food. This place advertises that they are a restaurant but the menu is limited and the food is terrible. I'm sure it would be fun to come with a group on the weekend but do not come for lunch or dinner. $27 for 2 and I would have rather had the McDonald dollar menu. Service was good and staff was nice though."}
{"text":"Amazing patio, great music, drinks and food. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the evening outside by the fire pit. The mixed drinks were well made and the sweet chili wings were flavorful. The pizza looked great and we heard it's delicious. A fun night out!"}
{"text":"This place was a long awaited revival of an Arizona staple.   The original Minder Binders was an awesome Barn shaped building, with peanuts on the floor, and random brick-a-brack all over. The Mission @ Minder Binders basically pulled the kitchen OUT of the center of the bar, and moved it to a separate building, but left a majority of the fun intact. There is still the moose with the cigarette, still Bush Senior in a wedding dress, and lots and lots of beer signs.   The menu is significantly smaller than expected - mostly burgers and salads. There are also a few chicken dishes.   The cocktail menu is decent, but not consistent. My father ordered a class \"Harvey Wallbanger\" and it was awful. We actually googled the recipe on our phone to show to waiter. He was rather offended he sent the drink back, and continued to ask \"what we didn't like about it...\" and we explained several times over that it wasn't a Harvey Wallbanger.   That aside, this place is so stitched with nostalgia and fond memories, we will be back. Hope to see you there."}
{"text":"Went with other people for dinner and everything we heard about this place was correct.  The decor was kept like it was originally. The Mission attached to the restaurant gave it a small village feel.  My pizza was excellent and I tried my friend's a Jiffy hamburger. Never knew peanut butter would be good on a burger.  Shelby was our server and was quite knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive.  Going back for sure!"}
{"text":"MB's always had good burgers and drinks. The new one picked up where it left off. Had lunch there and met the owner who gave us the rundown on how it came back together. Very interesting and I am glad to have it back."}
{"text":"Never experienced the original but I do like this place. The chicken sandwich and steak fries  were better than than average. I had lunch at the bar so service was not an issue."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for an opportunity to come here after it re-opened. I know it's unfair, but I was hoping to fill a nostalgic hole, having spent many hours, IQ points, and dollars at Minder Binders some 40 years back. It was not to be. Gone is the loud party atmosphere. Now it's a quiet place for drinks and food. The decor is great, the servers terrific. The outside patio area is wonderful. But the menu is really pathetic: if you want more than appetizers you'd better be happy with pizza or burgers. The burgers we ordered were good. The beer selection adequate. The dessert menu dull and limited. Why not add a steak or two to the menu? Or some barbeque besides ribs (which were ok). Pump up the desserts - how about some homemade pies, ice cream, cakes?   When we got there (around 7:30) the place was nearly empty - at first we thought it was closed. Back in the day this place was packed with horny ASU students every night of the week. Not anymore. I hope they do something to bring in the crowds like bring in a professional chef to get the menu up to par."}
{"text":"No cons here! Great place, and I will definitely be back. We split a Hawaiian pizza, perfect size, crust was perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. $5 margarita was one of the best I have had. Cheese curds were amazing, I wish I could just order them all and take them home with me. Great service and very friendly waiter. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"As a Tempe native, it was hard to imagine that a place that holds such great memories could possibly be revived to my standard, but this exceeded my expectations!   The menu had the usual fare but everything is prepared fresh and has nice presentation. Even the burgers are ground fresh daily! Who does that?!  My wedge salad was one of the best EVER with fresh cooked bacon and a nice big chunks of blue cheese. (My mouth waters as I think about it! )  The server was great but appeared to be short-staffed so we had a little extra time to visit before getting our food but it arrived hot and fresh. The burger patty to go with my salad was delish and also prepared perfectly.   Be sure to check out all the cool stuff on the walls and ceilings! These are all the items I remember from my youth. A special thanks for reviving such great memories! We've lost so many Tempe landmarks to development that it makes this place an even more treasured establishment that I look forward to returning to again and again!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza the Betty Rizo was unlike anything I have ever had, the Hot Diggity wings are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Beware pizza lovers. Apparently, Sister who ran this  sold her interest to Brother who ran San Tan Flats, but pizza recipes stayed with Sister and are gone. And I gather fled the state.  More limited menu  in other areas. No longer worth the drive up from Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Hmmm, I don't think there is a reason for my family to take a trip to this place anymore.  They are under new ownership and now they are a \"steakhouse\".  Not sure if I would have thought that by the menu.  Lots of burgers, I had the bacon blue cheese one.  It was good, but nothing really special.  I ordered a burger for my son.  He only has ketchup on his, so I made sure to ask for just a plain one without anything, just bread and meat.  My server repeated it.  When he brought it, the burger had lettuce tomato and onions, I was quick to just lift off those items from my sons burger before he saw it.  My little girl had chicken fingers, they were ok, but a little chewy/hard.  They were on the skinny side and the breading was hard.  She didn't eat all of them.  Since there is new owners, they don't offer their pizza, and they seem a little defensive when you ask them about it.  Both the hostess and server said \"It's a steakhouse now\" and our server emphasized that if we wanted pizza there were several places around that offered them, and mentioned a couple of names.  I almost got up and left, if it wasn't because my boy had asked for a hamburger already.  But thanks for the tip.  I will check them out."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Tempe. I've passed by it hundreds of times and decided to finally try it. Amazing wings and the crust on the pizza we got was delicious (I always leave the crust uneaten). I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The place looks great, the new owners have invested well and tastefully.  Sadly the same cannot be said of the food and service. The menu looks promising, but is a mix of heavy sauces drowning out taste, or skimping in the basics; my Jiffy burger had half a schmear of PB, barley enough to be recognizable and drowned out by the cheese. The service tries but has obviously not been trained.  Not only did it take an extraordinary time for orders to be taken, we ended up having to get our own menus because the hostess took us to our table and left us.  The waitress forgot one order, probably because she couldn't hear us over the overly loud music.  The food that eventually came out didn't match the orders, and then they messed up payments.  If we go back it will be 6 months from now after they shake more things out, hopefully."}
{"text":"Tried the sourdough pizza! Yum!!  Today was the first day they served Red Velvet cake!! Delicious!!! Glad to see they are adding items to their dessert menu. Typically great, friendly service from their staff! Go upstairs and check out their game room too. Great fun and flashbacks."}
{"text":"Kristen was amazing she is the owner she actually came out from the kitchen to see how I wanted my pizza cooked. Now that is great customer service."}
{"text":"I have passed this place in my car on multiple occasions wondering what was on the other side of the large wall concealing it's interior. Stopped in last Friday night to check it out and was quite impressed with the patio ambiance, décor, and how large, yet cozy, the interior was.  It is a friendly place. It was very clean with just the right amount of lighting to be comfortable. I ordered a cocktail and wings. I consider myself to be a wing connoisseur willing to drive for miles to feast on some of the best wings in the valley. These were some of the best wings I've tasted and give Bricks and Cogburn's a run for their money. According to my server, they are baked, fried, and then grilled.  They had just the right amount of spice with a slight mild smokiness that made me think they were cooked over mesquite. The pizza also came highly recommended and looked good but I will save that for another trip. Definitely recommend this place to sit at the bar and watch the came, chill on the patio with a date, or grab a booth with some friends.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Burger 4/5 Fresh ground beef was really good. The Hot Rod burger was very good, with avocado mayo  Fries Both the steak fries 2/5 and the sweet potato fries 3/5 were over cooked   Margarita pizza 2/5. It was very bland. We didn't notice anything unique about the crust either.   Environment was unique which we always enjoy.   We probably wouldn't go out of our way for it because the sides weren't great. Unless I was in a Hot Rod mood - wish it came in smaller 1/4 patty size."}
{"text":"Excellent buns on that cheese  burger, and the Chicken Tenders are awesome. Great to see this place back in business and doing such a great job at it."}
{"text":"Very surprised by the mixed reviews. I went there for the second time today since the reopening. Wanted to make sure my first time wasn't a fluke. Both times were excellent. I arrived shortly after they opened at 11:00 AM, so there was plenty of staff, maybe that's not always the case, but in my case, there were friendly servers and bartenders everywhere. Everyone smiles and says hello, very friendly and warm and nice.  The lunch menu has a fantastic selection, salads, burgers, chicken sandwich, pizza and fantastic appetizer selections. My colleague and I both had the Cobb salad last time. We were told that most people don't finish it, I can see why, it was enormous, fresh and excellent. Prices are very reasonable for the quality and portion size. Today, I had the Alpine Swiss burger. It is more like an artesian burger, prepared beautifully, excellent toppings, very fresh, well put together. The steak fries were outstanding and they have fantastic ranch dressing!  In my humble opinion, this is one of the best restaurants anywhere near Tempe marketplace, blows the others away by far. I would definitely recommend going for the atmosphere, which is really cool, the service, prices, quality, and friendliness of staff."}
{"text":"So I've been here about 4 times since it reopened, service gets worse every time.  We went yesterday with a work group (9), they said with a group this big they only have a table on the patio with no servers.  It was a Thursday at 11 am, what?  Did I miss something?    Being pressed for time, we stayed, the place was empty, we had to go to the bar, place our drink & food orders.  A few different servers brought our food, and water, never to be seen again.  We waited and waited for the check, finally, we went back to the bar so we could pay.  I had the wings, they were AWESOME, so big I asked for a box to go.  But sadly, the servers never came back by our table.  I won't be back..."}
{"text":"Good food BUT NOT KID FRIENDLY.  The only reason I say this is because there are no high chairs or boosters in the entire restaurant.  Which can make the dining experience really challenging with an on-the-go toddler.  Beautiful patio for those amazing AZ evenings, but the only way we could keep our kid from not running around like a crazy person was moving inside half way through our meal so we could trap him in a booth.  I understand that Minder Binders may not be trying to market towards families, but there are always several families with little ones here.  Even some of my favorite sports bars have a high chair for the occasional little one."}
{"text":"Pass here all the time and finally stopped to check it out. It's owned by the same people as San Tan Flats so we thought it couldn't be bad...Absolutely LOVE it here! Very rustic and old school, huge area and super nice staff! Fun place to walk around and look at the all the historical decor. Not your typical college hangout, thank goodness there's still good old fashioned fun bars around. Can't wait to become regulars!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the worse service I've seen in a long time. How long does it take to bring you a menu. And then how long to actually bring a beer??? This place should have stayed to dust bowl it was!"}
{"text":"My parents used to come here when I was small but I'd never been. My husband and I walked up and the girl with blue hair and eyebrows was awesome! Very friendly people working here and our server was the super! We ordered the cheese curds which were the best I've had in a long time. Squeaky with light breading. I ordered the pizza with fennel sausage and it was very good.  Super thin crust but it wasn't soggy at all.  My husband had the pastrami burger on rye and loved every bite. Great seasoned steak fries and a crispy pickle made it delicious. The decor was what I remember my parents talking about; fun and eclectic. We cannot wait to go back and try more menu items."}
{"text":"I decided to meet up with a friend here for lunch. I know this place had a huge remodel and it definitely has a mix of old meets new.  Since my friend was a little late I decided to grab an appetizer and a drink while I waited. I had the peach sangria and it was absolutely perfect. Great drink for a hot day which was nice and light.   For the appetizer I got fried pickles and they were absolutely delicious. The price wasn't too bad for them and they filled me up since I was starving.  My friend finally arrived and we ordered lunch. She got the taco salad and I got their pizza. I Read Reviews that the pizza might not be so good but It was surprisingly delicious. It had corn, artichokes, onions and an alfredo sauce. It was a nice twist on a pizza and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. The taco salad was absolutely amazing. It Was huge, A Classic And Tasted perfect. Definitely get the taco salad when your there.  Definitely check this place out, I bet the atmosphere is even better in the summer when you can sit outside."}
{"text":"Minder Binder's.......I remember this place from the early days. They have done a great job restoring this place and modernizing it and keeping nostalgic. Love it, stopped in for a couple cocktails on a Sunday, can't wait to come back and eat, the food that went by the bar looked AWESOME. (sadly I just ate).....I saw Wisconsin cheese curds on the menu.....so i'll be back. The bartenders were super chatty and friendly, so can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Service is pretty darn good, our bartender remembered our names throughout the afternoon and we never went without!  The Pizza here is Top Notch, Its not those fancy artisan pies that almost everyone is doing now, just a great pizza with great fresh toppings and OUTSTANDING crust!  The Place was full of gen Xers soaking in the nostalgia, yet none of the youngins working here seemed to know about the Barns history, Romance and Lore.  The place is squeaky clean and that's the part I don't remember!  Welcome back minder Binders! You did good and It was worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here with the family for a late lunch. Food was awesome. Burgers are freshly made. Pizza was really good too. The service was horrible. We ate outside and they had like four waitress'. The place was not packed at all. A few big tables. One waitress took our drink order. They brought my family their drinks. Took another ten minutes for another waitress to bring me a beer. She also took our food order. So not really sure who our waitress was? Food came out pretty quick. We then had to track down our waitress to get our check. I will comeback and hopefully the service will not be so bad as the food was really good."}
{"text":"I think this place probably actually deserves 3.5 stars. Solely based on the atmosphere, I would say 5. For the people that remember, the actual barn part of this place was awesome back in the day. I'm sad that they did away with the outside, but what they did with it is awesome. It's huge, has a patio, tv's at the bar, a great patio. It's super cool inside and doesn't get overly busy.  The service was good and the food was decent. Not much on the menu other than pizza and burgers though. For 8.95 my cheeseburger was ok. If definitely wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything memorable either. I feel like something just lacks here, but I can't figure out what it is. The prices for everything are a little steep too. 6 dollars for a 10 oz craft beer is pretty lame. At least do a $6 pint?! If beer were cheaper, I would definitely return, but if you're looking for a cool atmosphere it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times before and absolutely loved it. The food is fantastic every time, and the service HAD been very good up until today. Myself and 4 other friends went in today because a few friends are visiting from out of town and wanted to go to a good restaurant, so I suggested the Minder Binder. We got there, ordered wings for appetizers for all of us and waited a good 30-35 minutes before the waitress asked us if we were ready to order our meals. So we finally ordered and by the time we got our food we were mostly full already because our food was settled. We waited around for about another 15 minutes before she finally asked us if we were ready to go. Then she brought us all of our food on one ticket without asking if we would have liked it to be split up, she just assumed we were all on one ticket. So then she split it up 5 ways so each of us was paying more or less for what we had ordered for ourselves. Which wouldn't be fair but we had had enough at that point to make a scene so we just paid and left. By far one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had and it's sad because I love the food of this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, GREAT service and good selection of drinks.  Has both covered and uncovered outside patio area, will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Well, if I want to self-service. I would have gone to a drive-through. Really? The patio is self serve. However, a runner brings your food once you order at a window. And then... Has to bring you plates, napkins,silverware. And checks back later. Isn't that a waitress? Yes! Please offer a waitstaff for the patio. The servers inside came back once last week. And she received NO tip. Oh, and that dog...is not a service dog. Only if Burger King offer beer."}
{"text":"This used to be our spot back in the day... Have been back many times over the past year and a half! I went again expecting it to be the same, well that's a NO!  They have gotten away with all the waitress and now make you serve yourself.  Who wants to go out for dinner and have to serve yourself??? They slimmed down on their menu as well!  Such a shame!! This place had so much going for it and now they've turned it into crap!  Unless this changes I will not come back! SO SAD!"}
{"text":"So it was funny, because my friend and I were driving to this place and she kept asking me if it was the Barn, and I was so confused! I had no idea that The Mission Mind Bender was just a revitalized restaurant that replaced a bar that once was indeed a Barn, or at least barn theme music venue and bar. All along I thought it was just another branch of the Mission in Scottsdale. I was wrong. The Mission Mind Bender is in no way related to the one in Scottsdale, nor does it have anything to do with Mexican food. It's more a pizza and burger place..  The grounds are gorgeous outside. The owners did a great job decorating the whole place making it look like a grand scale mission, stucco and flowering trees and plants galore. There were plenty of flat screen tvs on the covered patio so our group could watch football this past Thursday evening.   Our waiter Kyle was a hoot. He also loved football or at least was involved in a bunch of leagues and was able to enjoy some of the game since he had to spend so much time at our table since our group kept getting bigger and bigger. In spite of having so many people, it was no problem for him doing separate checks and we felt the service was great!  My friend and I shared a pizza, half \"Sister Margarite\" half \"Scarborough Fair.\" (Insider tip: they can only halve pizzas if they have the same base sauce. Ours worked since both pizzas had the red tomato sauce as a base). Both were good pizzas but we weren't completely wowed. We were also extremely hungry after our run so we did eat a lot but I'm not sure if it's the crust or something else that would've made the difference.   Would we return again? Definitely! The atmosphere is awesome! The interior, especially upstairs, is full of so many cool artifacts hanging from the ceilings and on the walls. It's like opening a mini museum contained in a box and then it exploded. Spudz MacKenzie (the beer dog) lights, boats, a telephone booth, a pinball machine, Golden Tee games are all contained on the premises ready to play or explore."}
{"text":"Have to agree with the post below!  My husband & I had passed M@MB on our way home one night.  Weeks later we decided to go there to 'try a new place'.  He had the breaded tenderloin which was outrageous good.  I am not a burger person but decided to have one that night.... if you like burgers, you will not be disappointed.  One of the best I ever had.  So fresh, juicy & flavorful.  Our server Alicia was super sweet, helpful & attentive.  Great atmosphere & fun décor.  There was a wedding on the patio so we only got to see it at a glance but it looks like a great place for an event.  Can't wait to go back.  A must try."}
{"text":"My husband's old stomping grounds from back in the 70s has reopened after being closed for about 10 years. Kristin Bell's family bought this place. We met the grandmother who was so kind to us and gave us a tour around the restaurant. They kept the old building and renovated it, but kept many of the things from the good old days. Things still hanging on the walls and initials of young lovebirds sketched on the tables. They've cleaned the place up a bit more now, but it still has a fun vibe. It would be a great pace to hang out with a group of friends at night or family during lunch. Many people have come back to revisit their old stomping grounds and are thrilled to see some of their familiar surroundings. They have also added great outdoor patio seating - a really nice vibe out there. The upstairs is now for large parties. The bands use to play up there, but now play on the courtyard every weekend. We stopped in to see the place and ended up staying for dinner. The food is great! My husband had a burger and said it was great and I had the panko shrimp and a salad, both really good! We're definitely going back and bringing friends and family. The service by everybody was super friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Just visited this place last Saturday and totally loved it!!  The atmosphere is great and the food is even better!  I agree with the previous comment and I will happy dance my way all the way back!  I really thought it was going to be a totally young crowd due to it being so close to downtown Tempe and a total party atmosphere, but it isn't and we loved it so much!  See y'all Saturday!"}
{"text":"Had the Jeffersonian pizza, it was very delicious! My only complaint about this place is that are basically 3 things to eat here: salads, pizza or hamburgers. Enjoyed the pizza!"}
{"text":"Fantastic  sour dough crust pizza and fresh fried pickles in a historic atmosphere with movie props from a time long forgotten blended with today's modern conveniences and live chill music in the courtyard.  Our first time here and our server Natalia was amazing!!!  Her knowledge on the history and the food recommendations was superb!  This is a definite must in my book."}
{"text":"Went to Minder Binder's tonight to see The Black Moods play in the courtyard.  Beautiful building and the buildings shade the courtyard from late afternoon on ... very nice. I grabbed a table and proceeded to sit for about 20 minutes without ever being approached by a server.  I overheard some people at the next table mention that if you want anything from the courtyard, you have to go inside the bar and get it.  So I went inside and got a drink and a menu.  i ordered the Mesquite Chicken Sandwich Southwest Style with steak fries and they gave me one of the vibrating coasters that would let me know when it was ready.  The bartender asked if I wanted to start a tab, and under normal circumstances I would have, but I didn't want to have to haul myself back into the bar at the end of the night to settle up so i just paid for it.  To their credit, they actually brought out the food and then searched the courtyard for the table with the vibrating coaster.  When my order arrived, I asked for some ketchup and silverware and which point the runner pointed back to the bar.  So I again, I had to haul myself back into the bar so I could eat.  On the way back, I noticed a chalkboard on one of the walls with the pizza menu.  The menu I was given didn't list any pizzas ... if I'd have seen it, I would have ordered one.  The chicken sandwich was actually good.  Cooked through but not dried out and the fries were just what you'd expect.  I was actually kind of surprised because earlier I went to their website, and the food in the picture looked pretty awful.  This is the dumbest \"music venue\" ever.  Why go through the trouble of hiring a band to bring in a crowd if you're just going to ignore them when they get there?   There were about twice as many people in the courtyard as were in the building where you could actually receive some service.  They could have sold so much more if they just sent someone out to ask the people with empty bottles if they'd like another one ... and then actually bring it to them ... with a napkin if they ask for it ..  I certainly would have spent (and tipped) more if they didn't make it such a chore."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out last week and I plan on visiting again soon. The decor and atmosphere is fun and exciting, with lots of space.  I was in on a week night, but I would like to see how it is during the weekend. Got pizza and wings to-go, and both were very good! The chef that brought it out to us even suggested to throw it onto a skillet for a few minutes to warm it up when we got home.  She was very friendly and helpful. We also had some drinks while we waited. The bartender was patient with us and our indecisiveness, and tried to make suggestions where he could.  He did offer a deal with two beers and a pizza, but then realized that the deal was only on Tuesday nights, and had to retract the offer.  It shows that management is still working out the kinks and training their staff. Overall it was a nice first time experience and we hope to visit there with a bigger crowd in the near future to play games and socialize, like what we saw other people doing."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Billy Ocean - Loverboy)  I don't know what you've got, but it plays with my palates I want you so much Bo Bites I want to taste your beer  Want to taste sweet and tender without fear Can't stand the thought of my reviews somewhere else  Gotta try your place Gotta have it all to myself I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  Wanna go to The Mission Mission...mmm Wanna go to The Mission Mission Mission At Minder Binder   Minder Binder seems like a really cool place with a good back story.  Then again I'm here to talk about it's current state.    I came here on a whim with some people.  First thought it looked like some sort of a Spanish mission and was similar to The Mission in Scottsdale; which is not the case.  Ordering food & drinks was a walk-up counter and food served when it got done; odd way to do things in my books for such a place.  I shot for their famous Cheeseburger and ordered me a beer.  Overall, the cheeseburger was pretty basic in presentation.  The burger patty itself had a tad bit of a char crunched, which I definitely appreciated.  The entree came along with your choice of fries from string, yam, and fingerlings.  My friend ordered their cheese pizza; definitely probably my favorite of the night because of it's crust.  Very doughy, warm, and crunchy!  The cheese was oozy, but wasn't too messy.  In end, the place seems very cool and a place to hangout for drinks.  Service was a hit or miss and the food was okay at best. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was my third visit to the 'new' Minder Binder. I didn't have the opportunity to experience the original but I must say, it's probably one of the most unique places I've ever seen.   Tons of interesting collectibles, oddities and memorabilia. You can literally stare at the ceiling for hours and not check everything out. The second and third floors remind me of something straight from Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. Seriously. Go check it out. That or the Johnny Depp version of Willy Wonka... Love that guy. Anyway...  Stopped by on a Thursday for a couple drinks while watching a game of some sort...football I believe. My friends asked if they were going to turn to volume on the game up and although it wasn't their 'plan' they accommodated the request and I was soon surrounded by a bunch of cheering/jeering boys. They totally appreciated it.   Aaron & Cheri helped us at the bar and were extremely attentive and helpful. We ordered the Scarborough Fair & Sister Marguerite pizzas. Aaron made sure we were taken care of and they came out beautifully! Amazing flavorful dough, great sauce with a slight kick, cooked perfectly!  They're working on a new menu which looks fantastic! I'm excited to see what they come up with!   Check it out! It's super fun!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday evening to check out the new place.  Upon arrival it was a little hard to find parking, but they had a lot of spaces.  Once we made it to the hostess stand we were informed that all seating inside was taken but there were patio tables, and we were seated right away.  The food menu is small, VERY limited, but they make their own sourdough pizza crust and we really enjoyed our pie. The beer selection was also pretty limited for craft beer snobs like myself, however, they did have Mission Carrack on draft and were serving them in PINTS!!  Yes please (I'm not sure they know the ABV of that beer).  The best part of our visit was wondering around the bar/restaurant; outside they have a really large cozy patio (one half is self serve, the other is sit down).  Inside there are booths and a bar, and plenty of interesting knickknacks to look at that came from the old Minder Binders.    The original Minder Binders was a bit before my time, but I was always curious as to what the inside looked like every time I drove past the old red barn.  Much of the infrastructure was maintained and preserved and it's like walking back in the past.  The upstairs bar, which isn't in operation yet, looks like an awesome place for live music and libations; I hope they get that up and running soon.  Overall I definitely recommend coming here for the charm alone, and for some good pie and decent beer.  It wont be a regular spot because the menu is too limited, but I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Interesting place. Stopped for lunch and drinks at night. Will go back."}
{"text":"We come here quite often since we found it.  It's usually pretty good.  The food is great. The service needs a bit more help, kinda slow.  This is the first time  we sat at bar instead of a table.  Now this is slow.  We waited for bartender to greet  us even  though there's only two other people  in here.  Then we waited...... For our drinks.....  She took our order... And we waited.... The only thing she brought out quick was the bill.  Lol"}
{"text":"Hung out with my daughter, her hubby and his brother and they all wanted to go check out the Mission at Minder Binder, so off we went.   It was around 5pm Saturday night and we got there we were told that seating in the opened patio area (by the fire pits & fire place) is a self-serve area and that the bar outside was not opened yet that we would need to go inside to order drinks & food so we opted to be waiting on and found a table in the covered patio area.   After inquiring what they had on tap I went with a Wasatch Apricot Hefeweizen , I have to say, this is a pretty good beer, my favorite is the Four Peak's Peach Ale, and well this one comes in a close 2nd.  After drinks were ordered it was time to figure out the food, we ordered 2 pizzas, the Sister Margarite and the Mahalo. The pizzas came out one at a time, don't know if there was a backup in the kitchen.  The Sister Margarite was the 1st pizza to reach our table, it was your basic marinara sauce, roma tomatoes, garlic & basil and cheese. I really didn't care for this pizza, it just tasted bland.  Then the 2nd pizza came out when the 1st one was done, did they think the boys wouldn't have put away both pizzas? I have to say the 2nd pizza was delish, it had Applewood Smoked BACON and sweet pineapples, this was a yummy pizza.   For me, Mission @ Minder Binder is a spot to end the night with a beer by the fire pit, or even to start your night off with, good for drinks & apps"}
{"text":"It's back and looks better then ever. Feels good to be back on a place that is new but fits like an old glove. They have done a great job of blending the new place with the old feel. Did not eat this outing but what I heard from others will cause the food order on the next visit."}
{"text":"Great renovation of a Tempe classic.  The new exterior patio complements the interior, which is true to the original MB which opened in the early 70s.  The new patio is huge and will accommodate a LOT of people in good weather.  As the interior isn't that large, this is an improvement.  The menu is simple, and on three occasions of dining there since the reopening, I haven't been disappointed, save for one order of Buffalo wings that were a tad undercooked after requesting \"crispy\".  No big deal--they were big and tasty.  Beer selection is fine.  I haven't had any mixed drinks here yet.  Service good, but the wait staff needs to acquaint itself with the menu a bit better.  Not that unusual for a college town, with lots of staff turnover.    All three times I've been there, though, the place has been seriously barren of customers.  For a classic like this place, one would think it would be an instant hit.  However, Mill Avenue has changed since the heyday of the old Minder Binders, so competition is a bit more stiff than it used to be.    I'd suggest that the owners spend some serious cash on marketing.  Minder Binders is a true Arizona gem and I'd hate to see it go away again.  Good food, reasonable prices, and a truly unique atmosphere makes MB a definite stop when visiting the Tempe/ASU area."}
{"text":"As luck would have it, I landed at PHX starving, took a wrong turn and ended up at Mission. We weren't sure what it was or where to find the door but ventured on to find treasure in Tempe.   Per our usual, we opted to sit at the bar as we believe that's where to find the heartbeat of an establishment. The setting was authentic Wild West, without being hokey, and the bartender immediately made us feel like regulars.  The menu included creative salads, burgers, and pizza. We ordered a delicious pizza built on a crust from 120 year old sourdough starter and craft beer.   If you are fortunate, as we were, to have the opportunity to sit and chat with Dale at the bar, take it!!!!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Minder Binders since it was the previous Minder Binders (barn), so was interested to know what it looked like now.  The grounds are lovely, and not at all reminiscent of the old Minder Binders (that's a good thing).  The two patios are very conducive to the fabulous AZ nights.  Service was excellent, greeted immediately, seated immediately, and waitress was right on time - personable, suggesting drinks, etc. I had the Veggie burger and hubby had the Swiss Alps burger - both with steak fries.  - Veggie burger very flavorful and mostly stayed together.  But very delicious, and the cucumber, sprouts very complimentary. - Steak fries were good; but there is a LOT of them.  In retrospect, I'd have ordered a side salad and then pinched off my husbands plate.  Neither of us could finish the fries. - his Swiss Alps burger delicious, and he polished it off.  I had a margarita, but had to upgrade to a higher level of Tequila (since I'm a Tequila snob) ... but their upgraded Tequila's aren't all that upgraded.  More upscale choices would have been good. The menu is geared towards college crowd, burgers and pizza; but they have tried to offer some more grownup fare also.  They have the veggie burger, and a salmon burger.  And they have some nice salads, including Kale/quinoa which looked very tempting.  Appetizers are mostly deep fried, but two kinds of shrimp appetizers.  They were good and glad to see again, but not overly remarkable."}
{"text":"Happy Dance when Minder Binders came back!!!  That corner needed MB!! The new setup is absolutely fabulous...all the décor is cleaned and dusted off and the bathrooms are finally nice!  Just brings back so many great memories...great job recreating the whole place.  Bonus is the patio with gas fire pits and heaters.  No volleyball courts but the new setup is great!    The service was great came right before happy hour ended and our waiter was attentive and made sure we got a round right before HH ended.  We ordered our burgers and everything was delicious.  No more Thunderhump Burgers -Boo!  The burgers were still great.  Great beers on tap, great selection.  Happy hour was a great deal.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am a native Arizonan so of course I had been to the old Minder Binders when it was just a big red barn sitting in a field.  I knew it was re-done recently and so decided to try it out with my sister in law and niece and nephew.  I didn't recognize the place because it is so different on the outside.  A huge patio has been built with outdoor seating for well over 100 guests.  There is an open kitchen to this patio area so servers can quickly grab meals and guests can see and smell the food being prepared.  We ate inside at one of the old booths in the \"Barn\" and all the memorabilia is in tact!  The place looks awesome!  A new bar has been added, back lit with glass blocks.  Everyone was very excited about the decor and the unusual atmosphere.  One of those places you really have to see to understand.  I had a taco salad which was very good.  Lots and lots of meat!  My guests ordered two different burgers and Sarah had the pepperoni pizza.  The pizza looked delish!   Everyone said their food was prepared well and tasted great.  It is not 5 star dining but for this kind of establishment very good.  The menu is large with appetizers, pizza, burgers and salads taking center stage.  Service was good, waitress was helpful and efficient.  Overall I have absolutely no complaints and i will for sure go back. Prices range in the 8-13$ range.  The history, the careful and super well done renovation make it well worth a visit.  Oh, and last but not least -- restroom for women was big, clean, new and very nice!"}
{"text":"Definitely going back.  I remember great stories about this place before I was old enough to go and before they closed down.   I got excited when I saw the restoration process happening.   My first time here was on Valentine's day this year, for a night cap. We were super impressed with the outdoor patio, very open and lots of seating with fire pits.   Recently, like last weekend,  had the BBQ burger which was delicious and huge, I could only eat half.  I ate the other half, cold, the next mornin, that's how good it was.   The Fun Lil Salad isn't little so be ware. Fresh and crisp though.  Fiance and girl child had shrimp which they both raved about.  Love the atmosphere, lots to look at and cool little spots to take pics.   Their bathroom is gorgeous and very clean.   Our server was on point, friendly and sweet.  Their chocolate chip cookie is to die for it's like they're homemade, OMG.  It was gone in 30 secs between 3 people (I snuck 2 bites).  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow the pizza is amazing , the service is always friendly and quick, and the decor amuses my child for long periods of time."}
{"text":"The menu is limited and the service spotty ...but they have a great outdoor setting to hang out around and drink beer with friends."}
{"text":"WoW this place is pretty cool and definitely a must see,, funny my hubby and his buddies used to go there in the 70s and has many many fond memories.. today it's more of a destination eatery with an interesting decor.. food was very good , service was good.. got someone visiting??? great place to take them for lunch"}
{"text":"My first time here and I question why I never stopped in this place.  The place is large, with a lot of cool stuff inside.  Take a tour.  The outside patio seating has shade and sun, you choose.  Food and service were good.  Great place for Happy Hour.  Great age diversity of customers from kids to 70 year olds.  All having a good time!  Great burgers!"}
{"text":"It is a very nice place I just wish they offer a better menu, The food was good and the wine ok no a great selection."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a decent experience here. The pizza and salad were very good. Service was good and it was a Sunday afternoon and they had live music on the patio. We were driving arrive trying to find a new place and we were pleasantly surprised. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Had a bacon cheesdburger. It had a monstrous patty and delicious. The staff and management were all very pleasant and kind. They have TVS on every side of the bar. Great out doors area. Good Job, I will definitely be frequently visiting"}
{"text":"I love this place. Apparently this place had a sketchy reputation, but there is new management and let me tell you... The authenticity, the food, the drink deals! This is my new favorite place. Come see for yourself."}
{"text":"One of the quirkiest and eccentric eateries I've ever visited and thoroughly enjoyed!  This two-story unconventionally designed and laid-out establishment, contains some of the most peculiar and outright bizarre curios and knick-knacks ever seen in a restaurant!  Where ever you decide to sit in the place, you'll be overwhelmed by anomalous, irregular and outright eerie paraphernalia that for the most part is highly unidentifiable.  A real stuffed horse, in drastic need of re-sewing it's stitches!  A turn of the past century wagon hitch that appears to look more like a giant wooden toilet with provocative artwork inside!  Despite most of the stuff is hanging over your head, and somewhat intimidating, this place if fun.  The food and overall atmosphere is awesome and terrific too!  Great service, thanx to Natalya, but she seems to represent the rest of the staff well.  Although their menu isn't ultra extensive, everything had so far has been great.  Their 'You Little Devil' consisting of six deviled egg halves, piled high with bacon and chives are fantabulous, especially when washed down with ice cold San Tan Hefewiezen Ale.  The servings of Panko Shrimp including five plump and tasty jumbo shrimp, hand breaded with Panko and excellently golden-fried, served with interesting house sauce was well worth every bite taken - left wanting for more.  Our large group of 9 folks included at least two that had been regulars 'back-in-the-day' of this weird and curious joint dating back to the fun and festive as well as misty and smoky 70's - dating ourselves here aren't we?!  A batch of pizza's were ordered and no one seemed to have any complaints about them, so either the beers, 'tinis and 'ritas were doing their jobs or the eats were downright good!  If you're in the mood for a good time with friends (or without), like to be in the midst of a fun, strange, outlandish and somewhat unbalanced environment, this has got to be the place to experience from outperforming service from staff, to the off-the-wall bric-a-bracs and knick-knacks or trinkets throughout, this is for you - not to mention the tasty fun food too.  You can be above ground upstairs with a great bar and, get this, a real honest to goodness Creature from the Black Lagoon PinBall Machine, or downstairs surrounded by, and even topped by the weird of the weird... or outside in a fabulous courtyard with bar, firepit, misters and more!  By the way, this place really looks like a Mission when you arrive!  Though by far not haute cuisine, nor nouveau anything, this is a place for the fun food aficionádo and pleasure for the atypical gourmét.  Bon appétit to the Connoisseurs of enjoyment!"}
{"text":"Its hard to get over the way things used to be,  one tends to remember things better than what they really were. Yes, the old place was like, the most fantastic place in the universe, and with penny beers. But, it also smelled like stale beer and vomit...      ...this is a new day and we're older and more mature, we need something more sofistikated , but where we can still have fun. This is it. The food is great. The servers are on the ball. The prices are better than Scottsdale. Meeting the staff and the owner girl, they are just genuine and down to earth, between the food and the staff, I really feel my money was well spent. The place is clean, the bathrooms are nice and the guy in the kitchen seemed to know what he is doing. My ONLY complaint is that the bartender Copt a tude when I ordered a classic drink for my fiancé, a drink every keep should know, I even showed him the recipe I googled and, well, our server was really quick to make things right. I didn't even want to mention this especially after how well our server handled it, but a great bartender can really make a great experience.  I really am glad to see that old barn risen from the ashes, its like a little piece of me sticks to the walls every time I visit. Like Monties or Legend City there's some history there and this girl went all in where others gave up   Best wishes Lil miss Minder Binder, thank you for giving life back to a valley treasure       Here's to many more years!"}
{"text":"The service can be hit and miss but is usually decent. The pizza is awesome!! I always go with a pie and a Cobb salad! Cool atmosphere and good live music!"}
{"text":"Great food our server Derrick was awesome very funny and all over for service. Thank you for the wonderful time. Music was at a tolerable level to have conversations."}
{"text":"So disappointed in our experience tonight. I love this place and have been here several times. Tonight however our server was unprofessional and sat down at our table as well as other customers tables. Being a server for several years this is a huge no regardless of how laid back the establishment is. After waiting 20 minutes for our server to come I went to the bar to order waters since its 100 degrees out and stood there for a good ten minutes without anyone asking me if I needed anything. I headed back to the table to grab the rest of my party and leave when finally our server showed up and sat down with us. It took forever to get beers, appetizers, our food and for us to get our bill and pay took a half hour. Our appetizers were cold and our sweet potato fries were also cold, soggy, and flavorless. Our server also felt the need to interject on our conversation and tell me that what I was talking about was never acceptable to be talking about here. I would never in a million years think of giving my two cents on a conversation that was being had at a table no matter what. Needless to say I am more than disappointed and I will make sure to let everyone how terrible this place has gotten and we will never be back."}
{"text":"Cheri I suppose is the rude manager we spoke to. This business will not last because of YOU!!!! Not only do you have horrible customer service but you also are a complete liar. Just because you're a family owned business does not mean you can treat people like this. I'm contact the BBB of Arizona, how dare you!"}
{"text":"Simply put, it's not the same as it was before. The \"Hot Rod \" burgers we had were average, though the Avocado Aioli looked more like Guac that was turning brown already. The side salad was huge and good.  The best part of the meal was the fries. Big and crispy.  There are no high chairs or booster seats for kids. If you want something special besides the original decor, go to another place. If you just want to hang in a bar atmosphere with edible foods come here. We did see a pizza on the way out and it looked pretty good. If I come back it will be for an order of fries and a beer."}
{"text":"beautiful inside and great service try the burger with peanut butter it sounds weird but so good"}
{"text":"Most of the time when someone re-opens a true local landmark they get it wrong - that's not the case with Minder Binders! They have all the kitsch & Americana in the refurbished barn, but they've added a fabulous courtyard & outdoor eating. Its all grown up but has all the original quirkiness - It's cafe style so get your own food & bevvies! Loved the pizza, & the deviled eggs were interesting! A new favorite hangout!  This was obviously a labor of love for the daughter of the original owners. Great staff! I'm talking friendly, professional & after I inquired about the history, the owner's father (dad the atm) gave us a guided tour! Ask about the 'secret rooms' that would be PERFECT for grooms parties & bridal parties!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, but towards the end - lackluster service.  We never got refills on our drinks. Had to remind the server after getting out bill that we were due the $2 facebook check-in deal for the chicken strips we ordered.  He then disappeared to go find the manager, who was standing at the bar. I would go back, but would hope that we would get a different server."}
{"text":"Met family and friends here for dinner on a Friday night.  We arrived well before any crowd was there.  The hostesses seemed more impressed with themselves than with trying to help customers: both were narcissistic and unpleasant.  We asked to sit outside.  One area was reserved for a large party.  Expecting several people, we asked if we could join tables and were told no by the hostesses and a manager.  We took it upon ourselves to do to so and met no resistance.  The outdoor seating area is ample and nicely enclosed.  Access to bars was good.  Surprisingly, they had The Kraken: Black Spiced Rum which made for excellent rum & Coke.  Bartenders were much friendlier than other staff and earned a good tip.  Food was typical bar food but was rather fresh and tasty--perhaps a bit above average.  The highlight was the live band which leaned heavily (very) on Fleetwood Mac songs.  They played a wide variety of classic rock songs m/w other hits.  This place is historical and has great potential.  However, it appears to be poorly managed and some of the staff need a lesson on social skills.  Would we return?  Perhaps."}
{"text":"3 stars for the appearance of the patio. But it's deceiving.  You can hear the power plant across the street roaring the entire time. The fountain doesn't help filter the roar. Its a pretty weird setup. The courtyard patio is a \"cafe\" order they call it. You have to go in and order at the bar then seat yourself where they bring you your food when it is ready. Very strange. There is another patio where a wait staff will take care of you. I had a burger which was just OK. Never asked how I wanted it cooked so it came out well done. Dry and lacked flavor. My girlfriend had a margaritas pizza and she loved it. Would we go back ? Yeah. The patio is still awesome. But I'll just kick back and drink"}
{"text":"The good is good-ish. Tacos with no salsa but good tacos none the less. The atmosphere is fun and vintage Minder Binders. The service was so BAD we almost guessed how much we owed and left cash on the table.  My boyfriend had to go look for Sarah our server and she was in the kitchen making boxes while we waited well over 20 minutes for the check with empty water glasses. She had no personality. I won't be burdening her anymore. If we go back we will be sure not to sit in her area."}
{"text":"Very few TVs. Really too bad. Plus, lamps at bar obscure TV view! Slow service for food and drinks. Couple next to me waited 30 min for food. Expensive drinks/short pours"}
{"text":"Really good pizza- good for groups, dining with kids or parties.   We've been there twice (April & July around 5-5:30pm) both times the service was poor. In an almost empty restaurant and ample staff standing around, we were forgotten about.   The first time it took us 15 minutes to find a hostess or wait staff to seat us and additional 15 minutes to place a drink order. It could have been a fluke, so we tried our luck one more time.   The second visit, we were seated immediately....and just as quickly forgotten about. It took the waitress 30 minutes to take our drink order.   If we ever go back, it will be for take out only."}
{"text":"Lovingly preserved, everything that made it special in the early 1970s is still there. Service and food great. This blast from the past is well worth the trip, whether you were there the first time or just dig the authentic hippie vibe. We'll be returning frequently."}
{"text":"I loved their pizza, more specifically, the crunchy and tasty pizza crust. The outdoor dining with a firepit adds to the fun atmosphere, and the servers were very friendly and attentive. I will always remember that my first experience at the Mission was so much more fun ... than my first (and the last) date with that boring person I was with that night.  :\"}
{"text":"Having loved Minder Binders back in the day. I was hesitant to see what this mission at minder binders was all about.   To start off. A-1 customer service. So much so that I would recommend based solely on that. I had the party on the back and it was made perfectly. I couldn't ask for a better burger. The steak fries were great as well. Having Papago orange blossom was the best addition to the meal.  But wait there's more.  The music selection took me back to those fateful final days of minder binders. To complete this delicious meal was the mothership a true to be said decadent carrot cake with mascarpone frosting.   All in all a great meal. The only minor downside is not accepting amex but hey that seems to be a growing trend these days."}
{"text":"This place is probably the best kept secret in Tempe! My husband pulled it up on his phone last night and said how about we try this place since we haven't gone here since the 90s... I remember the volleyball court in the back and having so much fun there then so I said \"I'm in!\"  We had a delicious fillet steak and lobster tail that was out of this world and very reasonably priced. Following dinner we sat outside on the patio and listened to a guitarist. So much fun!   The renovations and build out are well done! So much to look at. Our server was attentive and pleasant!"}
{"text":"So your hours say midnight, but I came at 10:30 and was rudely greeted by one of your hosts saying that they've done last call, and when I ask what their hours are, he immediately walked away without answering me. Guess you really don't care about your patrons."}
{"text":"Service was excellent food was great, menu is varied with a lot of choices. They maintained the old Minder Binder charm with a fresh look. Glad to be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and the pizza was fantastic.  We met some friends for lunch and it was a great place to eat and talk."}
{"text":"In town for Spring Training (ST) and we saw a billboard for this place at the Tempe Stadium.  We talked to a group of locals who said it was worth a visit so we went over our last night.  Wish we'd tried it sooner!  It is primarily a bar and has a bar like feeling to it.  It's noisy but not in an obtrusive way.  Pretty uncrowded on a Monday night and we were seated immediately.  The menu has appetizers, salads, pizzas and burgers.  The pizzas range from like 12 to 21 dollars and are thin crust, plenty of food for two.  We had an appetizer and split a pizza and had left overs.  The crust is thin and crisp and there are plenty of toppings.  I know the pizza is advertised as having a sourdough crust but I really couldn't taste it.  The sauce had a nice tang to it and they were generous with toppings.  I had the fried cheese curd appetizer and they were tasty and piping hot.  Decent beer selection.      For 1 pizza, 1 appetizer, 1 beer, and an iced tea, it was $40 after tax and tip.  Enjoyed the food and atmosphere, we'll be back next time we're in town for ST."}
{"text":"Beautiful outdoor patio, shaded from the sun. Went here with 20 friends from work, and we had a great time. Ordered pizza and wedge salad. Both were DELISH. Servers were very attentive."}
{"text":"Great revival of an ASU-Tempe icon. Patio remodel is very cute, but the real action/ feel is still inside. Love the crazy antiques high and low. Solid beer selection and really tasty pizzas and burgers. The deviled eggs are amazing, and the fried pickles among the best in the Valley. A new local favorite!"}
{"text":"I wasn't psyched about the food here.  In fact I stopped at Taco Bell on the way home if that tells you anything.  The service was good and they have a nice outdoor patio but I wouldn't come back for the food.  I tried the cheese curds and Wedge salad.  It was your average bar food menu and tastes, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Have been to this place a few times before and hate to say this is probably my last time. They don't have pizza on the menu anymore which was the best thing on the menu. Menu is completely redone I'm not sure if it's due to its new steakhouse concept Or new mgmt. service was terrible. Really disappointed because this was my go to place in Tempe but I will now find a replacement. Fried pickles were good though"}
{"text":"Went to the new MinderBinder last night for the first time since it's been closed.  Great looking place, service was good, food was good.  Shrimp cocktail and panko crusted shrimp were very good; burger was excellent; pizza was good - better than expected to be honest (home made sourdough crust was tasty); chicken tenders were good too.  We'll definitely go back to hang out on the patio with friends and just relax (rained last night unfortunately).  Waaaay cleaner than the old MinderBinder - thank god!  Upstairs bar looks like fun too - just miss the old table shuffleboard that they used to have upstairs - I hope they bring it back!!!"}
{"text":"Minder Binders has great Ambience, above average food and fantastic waitstaff. Friendly and amazing service,very attentive. Very cool place to hang out. The patio is beautiful!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place 30 years ago it was always a fun location. We were there last night and was thoroughly impressed with the facility, food and service. We will be back there soon."}
{"text":"I'm really glad MB is back!  One hell of a visual spectacle inside.  You really need to show up just to see it, amazingly unique.  Worth a visit for anyone.  Plenty of room to hang out too.   Be sure to walk both the down and upstairs on your first visit.  Nice open patio with fire place and firepit after dinner.  It's clean, service has been ok (better in evenings), and food is pretty good!   The Hot Rod burger and the shrimp I'd get again."}
{"text":"I just love that Minder Binder is open again.  If you're a Sun Devil, you'll agree.  Structure is about the same as I can remember.  Happy hour prices are awesome.  Food is good.  Esp the pizza."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's day. I was a bit hesitant just by looking at the outside but went ahead. We ordered the fried pickles with ranch. They were great and the ranch was awesome, seems like they make it themselves. We also have the shrimp cocktail and the special, which was a club sandwich with steak fries. The shrimp were excellent and tasted fresh. The club was great, fries were great, and the server was wonderful (I believe his name was Josh...?). Cocktails were on point as well, I had an infused vodka with berries and cucumbers. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite spots in Tempe. When parking at Four Peaks is ridiculous I just swing by here now, and I'm never disappointed. The atmosphere is great, inside its old rustic and a perfect throwback to the old Minder Binders and outside is a vibrant and relaxing patio experience great for large groups. The food is top notch, and special orders are accepted with a smile. I have a feeling I'll be coming quite a bit from now on."}
{"text":"Had not been here since the re-opening.  Needless to say 5 Stars. Had the Chicken Sammi and 1/2 steak fries and 1/2 sweet potato fries. Everything was excellent.  Was impressed with both servers that waited on us and the place was clean. For what it is worth the bathrooms were spotless too!"}
{"text":"MINDER BINDERS IS BACK !  HOORAH !  Mama Beth Bell !  So glad your family owns it now and for saving it. Thanks for polishing up Zeus and keeping all the boats intact..  Still loaded with wonderful memories and all the movie prop paraphernalia..  The Cobb Salad was great,  my daughter had the Patty Melt.. (wonderful) ...The burgers looked awesome and the pizza looked  super tasty too...   This place closed for 8 years... Come on ASU Alums,  take your ASU ALUM kids who missed Minder Binders the last 8 years and have a craft beer and a burger..Walk them around and see if you can find your autograph,, favorite picture or cartoon.. sleigh.. boat... crazy piece of WHATEVER...  Live music.. great courtyard..(perfect for Arizona nights)  people playing cornhole..  So glad they didn't change the great funky vibe..   See you soon !  The Mission building is a great reception area,  big meetings too..  Looking forward to enjoying this for years to come.  GOOD ON YA !"}
{"text":"This a great happy hour place! I remember going here back in the 90s for kamikaze shots and ladies night! I love the atmosphere and food . Great memories! Great times!  Keep up the awesome work and thanks for bringing back a Tempe memory!!"}
{"text":"After years of driving past the closed Minder Binders, I finally dropped in for a party. The building is very cool, with the inside decorated with tons of chachkies all over the walls and hanging from the ceiling. They have an extensive patio where the party took place. Their beer selection is decent but lacked a good variety of local beer on tap. Beers on happy hour were 4 or 5$ a pint, so not sure how pricey they get off of hh. We also had the margherita pizza, which was bland and forgettable. The place itself is worth a visit, but everything else makes it low on my list for local bars.    PS while here I got eaten alive by mosquitoes... probably from all their fountains... I know this isn't the bars fault, but it was pretty bad news."}
{"text":"So...first trip back to Minder Binders in about 37 years. We were pleased to see all the familiar stuff. I failed to locate the stuffed horse but they assured me it's still there. They have kept the ambiance and updated it. And the courtyard between the buildings looks great. Will look even better when it's not 114 degrees. Thank heaven you can distinguish between the restrooms now - we used to have to wait for somebody to come out to be sure which one was appropriate unless you were really into Dungeons & Dragons.  We enjoyed the unique burger creations and I went with the Hot Rod (with pepper jack cheese, deep fried jalapenos, and avocado aioli). It's nice that the sweet potato fries are a regular side option and not an extra charge like a lot of places do. And they were delish! The burgers are big and juicy. We'll definitely be going back.  If you haven't been there for 37 years either, you'll also be pleased with the new parking lot. :-)"}
{"text":"I'm part of the Phoenix-area comedy scene and we were given the opportunity to practice our bits every Sunday night.  We did one show in the Upstairs room and most of the comedians bombed on stage because everyone's ADD kicked in when they saw all of the things hanging on the walls and ceiling.  Sometimes that happens with people in new rooms who are less experienced in comedy (like me), but it was insane watching even the most experienced comedians do poorly at that show.  With that being said, it didn't work out the way we wanted to and we're not allowed back in, but I have no hard feelings and I hope they give us another shot.  Anyway, 5-stars because this place is amazing.  Beautiful patio outside of the building, and then you walk in and the further you trek, the weirder and wilder it gets!  You think to yourself \"hey, can it get weirder than this?\"  Oh yes it can!  And it does from the very moment you take your first step upstairs....I can't even explain the upstairs room.  You need to check it out if you want your mind to be blown to pieces.    I wish I could talk about the food, but I got here at 10pm when the kitchen closes, so make sure you get earlier if you want food on a Sunday.  It's too bad we can't do comedy here anymore because it's such a fun room!  We're sorry we weren't funny enough for Minder Binders."}
{"text":"We came back to this restaurant after a failed visit a few months ago and it was a strong enough showing for us to come back. This has the nostalgia of 30 years ago but some modern touches around it. For those of us that visited this location in college it is fun to revisit those times.  Atmosphere - They have done a great job bringing the old Minder Binders back to life. With all of the work they have done on the outside you have options depending on the time of year.  Beer - Since this is a bar & grill I'll rate the beer selection. It is OK but I'd like to see a broader selection of taps and more local beers.   Service - Our waiter was pretty good, paid attention to the table but not overbearing. We had multiple staff stop by the table so they work as a team.  Food - The food was very good but the menu is limited. Scarborough Pizza - Good, could use a little more seasoning and I'd like them to charge a little more and add more of the fennel sausage. Dances with Goats Pizza - Really good. A lot of great flavors. The only adjustment I'd recommend is to cut the onions into smaller slices. Both pizza had a really really good crust. Swiss Alp Burger - Really good. It was cooked to perfection for my requested medium rare, a feat not always accomplished in a bar & grill. The highlight of the burger was the caramelized onions. I'm not a big fan of sweet sauces but the honey bbq worked. Patty on the Back burger - Really good, a lot of flavor in the meat.   I'd like to get some spice & heat into the menu to add variety. The Apps are predictable and need some creativity. They need to offer a little more than the Pizza and Burgers, although both are very good.  Overall a good visit, a fun casual drop in bar & grill."}
{"text":"The service was very good on this busy night. We were sat right away and not only was our waitress attentive but she had assistance from the other staff like refilling our drinks or clearing our plates. The decor was quirky with a dive bar atmosphere but the place was a lot bigger than a dive bar.  The restaurant had a wide variety of drink options from mixed drinks such as The Manhattan and Skinny Margarita to a wine list and bar list (tap, bottles, and  cans). However, their Happy Hour on Saturday was very exclusive. You could only participate if you rode in on a motorcycle. So is this place trying to appeal to \"Sex in the City\" ladies with their mixed drink and wine list, college students with their beer list (located in a college area), or bikers with their happy hour specials? Sounds like they don't know who their clientele is yet.   Finally, onto the food. Me and my friend ordered the hot diggity wings which were DELICIOUS. They had a nice kick to them without being smothered in sauce. Two thumbs up for these. We also had the King Leonidas pizza ( pepperoni and sausage) and it was very disappointing. Honestly, I've had better frozen pizza.  In the end, I would give this place one more try but instead of pizza I'll being having a hamburger."}
{"text":"What a great looking restaurant inside and out however there was no one there and I completely understand why! The food was pretty good but the service was horrible. If there are going to be more than 10 people at your table then you must sit out on the patio where there are no waiters. It really did not make sense to us since the entire place was empty. We had to walk into the bar one by one and order our food. Needless to say no one left a tip because how ridiculous was that? I wonder if the owners know how that place is being managed?"}
{"text":"Went to this place on Saturday night. Service was ok.  Food was ok.  I ordered the Taco salad and my only real problem with it was it tasted like it was a Taco Bell taco salad and the ground beef was really cold.  Maybe it was suppose to be that way but I wasn't excited about it.  Fried pickles on the other hand were hot and crunchy.  Yum.  I could talk to my friend there and I could hear her so that was good.  I guess I just was not that excited over this place.  It just didn't give me the 'I need to come back' experience."}
{"text":"came in for an impromptu dinner. I had really high hopes for the pizza as I had heard it was yummy!! we had an awesome server, Sheena, who was kind, filled with energy and flair (because she had blue hair!) she consistently checked in on us despite having several tables. she definitely helped give an extra star to this review.  now for the food: we had deviled eggs and cheese curds for appetizers, which were both standard good. as far as entrees they offer pizza, burgers and salads. we ordered a pizza, (having heard it was delicious) - half hawaiian-style \"mahalo\" and half \"dances with goats\" which included artichoke, corn, feta, onions and tomatoes and supposedly goat cheese. didn't find much cheese of any kind on either half of the pie. and unfortunately, both seemed to be lacking basic seasoning as well. the sourdough crust however, was good. there's definitely potential there for great food... the ambience is nice and they also had live music. will probably go back to try a burger and see if it was just an \"off\" night in the pizza department."}
{"text":"So the last time I ate here was about 35 years ago.  Today was meh...not bad, not remarkable...just meh.  We had a cobb and taco salad.  The cobb was better than the taco salad.  Unfortunately the taco salad at taco bell is better.  They spent a lot of money remodeling the place into its current configuration but what they didn't change was the stale beer smell that at least dates back to my last visit."}
