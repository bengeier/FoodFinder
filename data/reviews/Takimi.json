{"text":"visited this place as I have never been to it and looked decent. Biggest regret of the night. Extremely low quality food and no taste at all. Do yourself a favour and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Alright, so I ordered $35 worth of food for delivery.
I ordered a salmon bento, a black dragon, fries, and spring rolls.

The delivery person called me because they had difficulty finding the place and they were either bored or grumpy. I tried to be cheerful but they seemed to take no effort, regardless I tipped them $5 even though a tip had already been included in the $35. They did not accept it modestly but with a bad attitude.
If the delivery person is ESL then I can sort of forgive them.
The delivery was 30 mins early which was nice.

When I unpacked the food everything was there but the black dragon was on its side and the miso that came with the bento was stank af.

The fries and spring rolls were good.
The salmon in the bento was meh. It was a little dry, hard to chew, and hurt my throat.
The sprouts that the salmon was on were repulsive. I couldn't eat too much of that portion of the bento before feeling sick.
The rice and gyoja were ok but not extraordinary.
The tempura was alright. It didn't look pretty or taste better than average and it was very very greasy but the sauce was amazing.
Btw when it comes to sauce this place makes great tempura sauce and the soy sauce, whilst it smelled bad, tasted better than it smelled.

The Cali that came with the bento was good.

THE MISO. OH MY GOD THE MISO. It was so bad. I have had good miso before and this is far from it. I took it far away from my house to pour it out. I'm not sure if this is the traditional recipe and I've been trying adaptations or whatever but JESUS I hate this miso.

I don't like to give bad reviews in case I close down a mom n pops store and force a family into poverty but the staff I got leads me to believe that this store prioritizes quantity over quality.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.
I HOPE THIS PLACE COMES OFF OF JUST EAT.

I feel really bad about giving this such a bad review incase I'm taking away someone's livelihood but I really didn't like my experience."}
{"text":"The best eatery around Steeles and Bathurst area... Very tasty and fresh food! 

Always I go for all you can eat... Lot of stuff to enjoy - the Sushis, the Makis, the Rolls, Sushi Pizzas... and lots more! 

Personally, my favorite is hot Sake rice wine and fried Salmon heads... simply mouth watering ;-)"}
{"text":"It was great service but unfortunately they have horrible food. Nice ambiance, clean, but not the best music .
If their food was as good as their service they'd be golden."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, sushi roll is very good, and lots of choice, waiter and waitress are very friendly, I will come again next time."}
{"text":"This review is based on take out only. 

2.5* (Didn't want to slap on a 2 because I've only had the experience of take out)

Quick note on take out service: it was relatively easy to order over the phone and they had our order (around 36pc) ready within 20-30 minutes. 

Now let's jump into the food. For two people I got 18 pcs sweet potato (yam) tempura rolls, 6pcs dynamite roll, 6pcs chicken teriyaki roll, and 6pcs california roll. 36pcs when made properly should be more than enough for two people (who aren't crazy hungry) and honestly we finished them off without any problems in one sitting. 

It sucks to say, but I know exactly why we could eat them all without having to either cry about our bloated stomachs or take a very longgggg well deserved nap. Basically, it comes off really clear with the size of the sushi and the way it was prepared that they were trying to cut corners wherever it would be cheaper for them. Like I'm talking about them giving me the end of a yam roll which is really like 1/2 the sushi it should be and passing it off as a full piece. Also, with my dynamite roll, they only gave me the tail of the shrimp in one or two of the rolls (no shrimp in the ends at ALL) - I don't know if they were expecting me to fish out the tail and eat the sushi without the shrimp or what??? Not cool. Lastly, this was beyond clear with them fitting 18pcs of yam tempura in ONE small container. They got smaller and smaller within the container so they could fit all 18pcs in one. 

Now that that I've aired my grievances about the sushi itself, let's talk about the price. $27 for 36pcs. I was struggling to figure out if this was a good deal or not but after comparing to the price of slightly better AYCE sushi for lunch ($13-15 depending on where) it doesn't seem to be worth it. The only reason I'd come back here for take out is for the simple 6pcs cucumber rolls and such just because it's around $3 for that. 

I wanted to try out their AYCE but now I'm skeptical, perhaps the quality of the take out is misaligned with the AYCE. Maybe I went in on an off day. Or maybe the quality's gone down over time. I'm not sure - but I am sure that take out isn't worth it in my opinion.

Looking at this review, I honestly feel that 2.5 is generous but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that their AYCE and take out isn't usually like this."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience. One of the worst quality sushi and other staff we had.   Quality is far bellow any other restaurants. Will not order again!"}
{"text":"Avoid this restaurant at all cost! Although the restaurant is a 6-minute drive away the food took over an hour long. When I received the food, I call the restaurant because half of my order was missing. The woman who answered was annoyed and stated tje obvious \"it's in a separate bag\". Then, silence... I got annoyed and suggested she should call the driver. She just said ok, I had to ask her to take down my number. Absolutely the worst customer service. Food was cold and tasted terrible. This business should be shut down."}
{"text":"I've been to a million AYCE sushi places. This is just another \"doesn't really stand out, but it's not so bad\" kind of place. You have your standard selection of items like tempura, salmon, white tuna etc. I'd say their selection is average. Sashimi is about as fresh as any other place. Service is non-existent as expected from most Chinese owned places. 

But...I'd still come here for sure when I have a craving and I'm in the area. I live nearby so there's a fat chance I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Good, fast and lots of variety! Would definitely come back. Better service would enrich the experience."}
{"text":"Whilst the food is delicious, the staff often tend to miss half of the order you submit to them. This is understandable as many all you can eat places will deliver your food in portions to ensure all dishes are eaten. However, takimi staff more than often completely forget/ disregard the rest of the menu you place an order for. This is extremely time consuming and inconvenient as you have to re-order all of the previous things which did not make it to your table. Also a personal pet peeve ( the staff drag their feet on the ground, instead of walking properly). Again this has nothing to do with the quality of food or the service, yet it slightly throws off the balance of the overall aesthetic."}
{"text":"I am giving a 5-star because I loved the food, presentation, and atmosphere. Yes, the service was slow but I will not fault the one girl who served all us lunch goers al by herself. She was courteous to us, gave us our food correctly. 

We asked for another table since the booth couldn't fit the baby car seat. Yes, no judgment on my guest. People need to get out of the house once in a while. The girl obliged without any problem. 

Now food, we got red and green dragon rolls. They were delicious. The spicy tuna was yummy, the only thing we thought was a hassle: the seaweed salad. It was served in a tiny bowl like the size of a table spoon. Could have given bigger portion but it is okay because you can always order more and we did.

Ice cream in the end is a must!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here before with acceptable results, but I think this last order will be my last from here.

Ordered through Just-Eat and was given a delivery time of 1:40. At 1:52 - almost 15 minutes after the scheduled delivery time - they call me to say that it'll be another 30 minutes.

WHAT. THE. HELL. At that point it would have taken an hour to order from somewhere else, so I just said fine. I seriously considered calling Just-Eat but figured it wasn't worth the effort for a small coupon or whatever.

So at 2:20, they show up with the food. The delivery person apologizes for the delay (\"heavy rain\", OK) but says it's fresh. It was not fresh. Everything was chewy and room temperature, including the sushi. Terrible.

Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This place used to be good for all you can eat sushi. Now it's horrible! Rotten food, slow service and a 10% service charge for a group of 3. I will never return to this place under any circumstance. They used to serve fresh salmon slices on sushi pizza, now they throw on some gross salmon, chopped up, turned brown, rotten and still with some skin. All raw salmon had turned brown, vegetables in the tempura had passed their prime. We were the only people in the entire restaurant (now I know why) yet the service was still slow. Other people who sat at a table next to us were also clearing our table, getting our food, but most importantly, getting their food before us. In addition I always tip at least 15%. When I received my bill I noticed a \"10% service charge\". We were a group of 3, that would be acceptable if it was a party but I found that to be the last straw. I did not tip anything as they decided for me that 10% was enough. Stay away!!! There are many other sushi places in the area and this is a dump!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, definitely a hit and miss. The service isn't the greatest just like the food. If you have no where else to go and this place is close then go for it. Overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Pros - Most of the food is delicious.

Cons - Only one wine available from their list of 20, no plum wine, no bottles of sake... only hot sake available, no cocktails or mixed drinks... Did not bring out many of our dishes, when they were reminded, brought out 6 soups and salads for 4 people...2 too many for our group.

As you can gather the service is slow and disorganized... but the food is good, with some patience and friendly reminders you will EVENTUALLY get what you ordered. The restaurant was not busy, so unfortunately I could not even use that as an excuse for the disorganization. 

I would have given only 2 stars, but I felt our server really was trying her best and that to me deserves an extra star. The drink issues were not her fault, but those who are responsible for stocking these items should be more involved in ensuring it is available."}
{"text":"Food was below par compared to other sushi restaurants nearby. Ordered a salmon bento box and the salmon piece was like the size of two fingers put together and was so thin it was basically fried skin with no fish! Fish at the counter doesn't look fresh either. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Sushi was NOT I repeat NOT fresh. 

I cannot believe that the quality of their food is so bad. The Nori was rubbery, and the salmon tasted like it went bad. The tempura was just dough. 

Honestly this place was so bad. They should be paying me to eat here."}
