{"text":"Went Sunday night with friends. Had the Sunday night prime rib ( for 3 ). Appeared prime rib was not fresh or it was packaged.  Not recommended.
It is a quaint English pub with typical pub food.  Good selection of beers. The waitress was attentive with us and other guests. Tables are very close together. Somewhat crowded during mealtime.  It is what it is.....an English style pub.  I would go again, more so for lunch."}
{"text":"Great pub atmosphere with regular lunch specials. Be forewarned that parking can be tricky. Can't go wrong with their fish and chips!"}
{"text":"What a treat.  Such a neat spot.  Great pub menu items for all.  Great selection of beer, wine and spirits.  Family friendly as well during dinner hrs.  Martin"}
{"text":"we used to frequent this restaurant 8 or 9 years ago and have just started coming back twice in the past 3 weeks. There were 6 of us the first time and Jennifer who has been their forever was amazing.  Food was excellent with prompt service. The owner dropped by to say hello and welcome us  Returned this past week and we're again not disapointed. Give it thumbs up and on a can't miss list."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade food and charming staff.  Perfect for the family or just snacking and enjoying one of over a dozen premium scotches or beers on tap.  *****"}
{"text":"Classic style British pub. Loving the fish and chips. Fluffy beer batter and tender fish. I usually get a side of gravy with my fries cuz it's very tasty. Also love the crab cakes"}
{"text":"Met two friends for 7pm drinks and snacks. Monday is wing night. We got medium sauce and they were OK but too saucy. Nice presentation and came with lots of napkins and wet wipes. We also shared a plate of so-so nachos. Bill total for food, 1 20oz Canadian draft, two glasses of Yellow Tail chardonnay, rum and coke and two spare diet cokes $51 plus tip. Good enough.

Service was attentive but not intrusive. Place was pretty full at 7pm but by 10 pm had dwindled down to half a dozen tables.

It was pretty cold as our table was at the big front window but it was -15C so no surprises there.

Good place to get together in a casual pub atmosphere."}
{"text":"People are way too generous with their stars! This place has gone downhill in the past couple of years while their prices have gone uphill. Someone said the plates are piping hot---duh...right out of the microwave! They must have a new meat supplier as the meat has downgraded so much in quality. This place attracts relics who yearn for a taste of olde home across the pond. The brews and the menu and the decor seemingly satisfy them but there are plenty of other places to eat if you want decent food at decent prices."}
{"text":"Best Reuben sandwich I've ever had. I like to keep my reviews short and sweet. Servers actually seem to care, food was excellent, and the service was exceptional. Perfect example of a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch between meetings. We told them we were in a time crunch and they expedited our order very quickly, but still gave us friendly and excellent service. Unlike some places which give you such attitude and half-hearted service when you let them know that you need to be out in a specific time. 

I ordered the burger and fries. The burger was exceptional. It was a housemade patty which was so juicy and flavourful. It wasn't overly thick so it didn't put me in a food coma or give me the meat sweats. The bun was very soft and complemented the patty well. 

The fries were fresh, but they were a bit dry for my preference. Perhaps they were in the oil too long for the second fry. I don't know. I usually prefer my fries more potatoey in the interior. Still, I managed to scarf most of them down so it obviously didn't detract from that all that much. 

Would definitely come back here. The only downside is the parking. I ended up parking across the street on a side street."}
{"text":"saw some reviews about how good the fish and chips, a bit disappointed with the old batter and frozen fish without squeezing the water, it's more expensive than all the other fish and chips restaurant around the area"}
{"text":"Real classic neighborhood pub that feels a bit out of place in the cozy residential area it sits in, but can't be beat when it comes to replicating what a pub should be: good food, good drink list, and no TV. 

The Crow's Nest is a place to circle around little tables and pass the time talking to friends over a pint or two, maybe stay a bit long and order some dinner while you're there (bangers'n mash or a meat pie?), maybe grab another drink and just enjoy time spent in good company while the world outside dashes along without you.

Yes, the parking isn't great; it has a small lot and relies on your legs to take you there from the local street parking. Yes, the close early; it's smack in the middle of a residential area and keeps more traditional British pub hours of operation.

But they have painting and axes on the walls, not jerseys and TVs; they serve food with actual care and flavour, not deep fried stuff out of a box, covered in sauce; and they have a loyal and welcoming community of customers, not an endless stream of transient drinkers and territorial regulars. 

They're not a bar, they're a pub; and there's a lot to be said for that."}
{"text":"If you wanna talk about surprising finds, you'll likely be referring to the Crows Nest on the list of surprising local pubs. 

It surprises start from the moment CN pops up suddenly in front of you as you drive north on Prospect in Newmarket. It's inconspicuous and blends in with the row of homes the bookend it on either side.

If driving, they have a great private parking lot with a picturesque stream running between the lot and the pub filled with ducks and geese pretty much all year long!

You enter in and you might be surprised or disappointed by the small pub inside but after closer inspection of the wall art and design, you'll realize this pub is a mix of traditional Irish/Scottish pub (slightly more Scottish). It's old, it's well kept, it's cozy - the perfect place Id want to to enjoy a scotch with pals OR a few pints of Guinness.

While I have yet to dine here what was surprising to me was how packed they are every night of the week. Reason being? They have a different food special almost every day of the week. From fish and chips to a Monday night Wing night, there is always a crowd here which makes a strong case for bringing me back. 

For now I'll enjoy this local spot for drinks but I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a good example of a pub that has been around a while because they are doings things right.
It is small and a bit tight however we were seated instantly and attended to right away.
The servers are not teenagers that are working for a short period, they are mature adults who care and are there for the long run.
There menu is typical pub food with a twist, they offer veal, seafood and breakfast too.
Fries are not frozen, food is tasty without loading it in sauce to cover blandness. Portions are consistent as with good service and reasonable pricing.
At the end of the day you can't please everyone but they seem to try to please, offer tasty food and great service.
Would def visit again"}
{"text":"It's bar food. I think the prices are a bit high for what you're served. Some items were delicious, others were not :(. I only went there because our friends went there. Doubt I'd go back. I'm not really a bar person, and its nothing special."}
{"text":"Great spot. Food is excellent. Clean. Very popular place."}
{"text":"Really nice neighborhood pub
Decor may be a little dated but it's bright and clean. We were here on a Saturday evening and it was quite busy with reservations and a party upstairs. It may be a wee bit pricey but the food was fresh and delicious and the service was warm and friendly"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this pub because it reminds me to home cooked food that isn't overly commercialized like most places.

The service is always friendly and efficient - it also seems like a lot of locals enjoy this place a lot (it's always decently packed).

Some of my favourites include their classic burger, the calamari, the club sandwich and my most recently favourite, the portobello mushroom burger w/ onion crisps, tomato and swiss cheese. The burger was very juicy and flavourful that blended with the onion really well. I didn't even miss the fact that there was no meat.

You also get a side of fries, salad or daily soup with most meals. 

Parking can be difficult because there isn't a lot in their parking lot but you can park across the street and there's a few spots in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch recently. Other comments about the parking lot are correct...it's tiny and fills up quickly. The pub is located on a small canal/river which is quite picturesque, so long as you don't look too closely at all the garbage that's lying around on the banks.
 The decor is fake English pub, but not in an offensive way. Have you ever seen the movie \"Cocoon\"? The clientele looked liked they'd escaped from the dining room at the Old Age Home. If they want to rename it, I'd suggest \"The Blue Rinse Pub\". Not surprisingly it was quiet and the overall atmosphere was pleasant enough. Maybe it's a bit more lively in the evening.
 The food is the issue here, and it was very good. The menu is huge for a pub, which is not always a good sign, in terms of freshness, but we were all more than satisfied. We ordered the \"house\" burger, a Reuben and the fish tacos. They all came with fries, and the plates were piping hot. The portions were large, and the quality was excellent. My three tacos came with six decently sized portions of battered haddock. At $12.99, I believe they were $3 or $4 cheaper than the fish and chips, but I'm pretty sure I had just as much of the light, crispy and flaky fish. If you want a kick, ask for some hot sauce on the side. My companions were equally satisfied with their choices.
 The waitress was efficeint and polite. All in all, an excellent, and reasonably priced luncheon."}
{"text":"I always drive by the Crow's Nest and thought I would try it out for the first time on a Friday night

The pub always seems to be busy. Which is a good thing!

I was quite surpised when I walked inside. The decor is something alright, but very pub/scottish/nautical feel. It was different alright but in a good way.

We had great service and the food was pretty good as well. I had clam chowder soup to start and my husband had French onion soup. Both were freshly made and tasted great.

For our entree, I had the Angus Beef Dip with fries and my husband had the Fish of the Day - Fried Cod with Tiger Shrimp with a special Tomato sauce served on rice. He enjoyed his meal as it was different and not a typical meal you would order but it's nice to try new things than from the traditional pub. 

My meal was really good as well. Very tasty and filling.

In the end we were content with everything from their service to food. We would recommend and definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Although I had recently given this place a 5-star rating, I think it may have been a fluke as it was my first time there. 

Gave it another shot and it will be my last. Tried it on Friday afternoon. Was greeted by a waitress and shown to our seats. The place wasn't busy yet but the waitress already seemed like she was in a rush. We selected what we wanted from the menu and when the waitress came by to take our orders, again she was in a rush and seemed frustrated to answer questions. When I was done ordering, before I could fold the menu, she snatched it from my hand. At this point, we were beginning to get a bit disappointed with the service but it only got worse. 

My fish and chips came and once I finished the fish, under it I had a nice big hair waiting for me between the fries. I immediately stop eating and waited for her to come by. I let her know there was a hair in my food but she didn't seem convinced.

In the end, we received our bill (in full) and we were provided a coupon for a free appetizer for next time....lol yeah, no thanks."}
{"text":"Good food (wiener schnitzel is a must-try), generous portions, decent variety; cold beer, bartender/waitress was friendly and best of all they were open when all the rest of Newmarket was asleep! My brother and I went to Newmarket on business a month ago and had good experience at the Nest. This trip we wanted to try something new but these other restaurants/kitchens won't serve at 9pm on a Tuesday when they state that they are open until at least 10pm. We were about to starve but stopped in and they were more than happy to serve us. My brother liked his burger, patties were made in-house instead of pre-made/frozen. Interior has charm."}
{"text":"This place is really cool.  Situated beside a creek amidst a thicket in residential Newmarket, a colleague and I came here for a drink after a business meeting.  

Very traditional English pub menu (pot pies, bubble and squeak etc.) and a terrific compliment of beers on tap.  Friendly service and a very local clientele.

We ordered the nachos (no, that is not authentic pub fare, I get it...) and they were great.

Need to return for lunch.  Recommended for BritPub enthusiasts and beer fans."}
{"text":"This is a nice pub to visit in Newmarket. They have great traditional pub food and a nice cozy atmosphere. I really enjoy the fish and chips - nice and crispy with good quality fish. The ribs are another favourite - nice and juicy, flavorful and fall-off-the-bone yummy! There is a good selection of beers on tap as well.

The staff are great and very attentive. When I have been to the Crow's Nest, the manager was always around making sure things were running smoothly and the customers were satisfied. This is nice to see, especially when there is new staff working and something is missed. Someone was always there to check and help out. 

Considering there are very few traditional pubs in Newmarket, I recommend giving this one a try. I plan on going again for wing night as I have heard good things! I am a sucker for good half price wings...with a few pints to wash 'em down of course. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had never been here before but found it was a good pub food.  I had the fish tacos and a spinach salad.  It is pub food so much is deep fried but aside from that the food was quite good.  My dinner companions had fish and chips which was very good.  The staff was attentive and extremely nice.  I would recommend this restaurant and I would go back."}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips. Fish wasn't cooked through and the fries tasted stale. Service was decent and beers cold. Couple of belligerent drunks at the bar ruined the ambiance."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining here recently. I had the Wiener schnitzel   It was very good served with red cabbage and potatoes. Very nice. Good if limited beer selection. Very nice English pub like atmosphere. Over all quite nice."}
{"text":"Overall impression: Nice classic pub ambience, decent food and mediocre service 

This pub is located just a few minutes away from downtown Newmarket with a small parking lot, and a great little river running right next to it making it feel like you're out of movie. The pub looks like an old school British house which I thought was quite neat. 

I don't have anything bad or good to say about the service, our server was also the bartender for the night and she sat us right next to the bar. She was super busy fulfilling drink orders and didn't check up on us or anything, when I needed something I would just yell at her from my seat to the bar. 

We ordered the grilled cheese, reuben sandwich and the perogies. The sandwiches were alright, they were nothing too special about these, the only thing that were super good are the perogies, they were downright delicious covered in butter, bacon and onion. I might come here again one day to get pub food, but other than that it's nothing too special."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite pubs in Newmarket.  The staff are so friendly and great service and the menu is quite good too.  Their nachos are one of the best I've had.  We also order with extra cheese and meat on the side and they are a meal in itself!!  Daily specials are great deals and good home made food.  The selection of brews is quite good and I keep coming back!! Although it's packed as local place, give it a try and worth the wait!"}
