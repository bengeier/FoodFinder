{"text":"Don't know why this place has such high ratings. The food is way overpriced for what you get. The chicken is dry and has no flavor. The potato was undercooked and the rice too salty. $22 for the souvlaki dinner, should have gone to Opa."}
{"text":"This is my go to for greek food in Calgary. The food is greasy and great. We usually order the combo for 2 and a souvlaki order. We've ordered for pick up several times but have not eaten inside. The interior is small and cozy."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Greek food and consistently high quality. A little pricey but a real treat if you like Greek."}
{"text":"Plaka is a little off the beaten path. -- deep south Calgary, in a Shawnessy strip mall near Zellers and Cdn. Tire . . .     It isn't hugely visible, even standing right in front of it., but this tiny restaurant serves up fantastic Greek food, and has for years.    I assume it's a family business, as it has that comfortable relaxed vibe.   They've always treated me like family, even if I'm just there for takeout.  Heck, one time they plunked a shot of ouzo in front of me while I was waiting to pick up my order.  Just because.    The menu is what you'd expect from any Greek establishment, but Plaka just seems to do it better.    On a personal note -- I visited Greece a number of years ago, and I have to say:  sitting in Plaka, and eating their food, brings back the restaurants I tried in Greece like no other in town."}
{"text":"I've had the roast lamb, souvlaki, and almost every appetizer and I love all of it! Super authentic food, cozy atmosphere and friendly service. I've only been here for lunch but it's one of my favourite places to go."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple times and I  never disappointed. The service is excellent and the food is delicious. If you're looking for an authentic Greek meal this is the place to try out."}
{"text":"We went for lunch yesterday and I got no complain about the restaurant. When you first walk in, it's very homey, staff was cheerful and friendly, food came in a reasonable time frame and it's delicious. We got the spanakopita, lamb souvlaki and baklava. The spanakopita was excellent, filo was very nicely done, beware of the bubbling cheese inside though! Baklava was a little too sweet for me, but overall was very good. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my husband here for the first time tonight and the food was delicious. The restaurant was busy when we arrived so there was a bit of a wait for our order to be taken. But when our order had arrived it was totally worth the wait!! Will definitely be returning for more!"}
{"text":"Excellent!! Visiting on our way to Edmunton. Had the Gyros (lamb and chicken). The pita is fresh baked and was perfect. Our server, Chris, was awesome and knowledgeable of the ingredients and preparation of the menu. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Really good food, a bit too salty overall. Loved the cheese appetizer flambe. Chef was extremely nice."}
{"text":"Picked up take out...  Potatos tasted like mustard, beans tasted like ketchup...  pita bread was burnt on one side and dried out...  Chicken was OK and the tsisiki was great but guess it does not come with the meal?  Thank goodness I order some on the side.  The rice had a over seasoning of cinnamon?   Although I know some cultures enjoy cinnamon I've never had it with Greek food here in Calgary or on the Coast?  Sorry to say $40 pretty much ended up in the garbage..."}
{"text":"So this is my third time here and I am here celebrating a couple birthdays. We had a couple of dinners for two with a party of 6. To celebrate we got desserts on house.  I love this place and highly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I love Greek food and I been to many places in Edmonton and Calgary. This is by far my favorite. It's small and romantic, the gentlemen working are personable and the food is full of flavor and authentic. It tastes like your at Greek family dinner, not commercialized like most! I cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I've been walking past this restaurant for over a year, and never went in. That was a mistake. I'm glad I finally changed my mind. The food was great. I had the Mixed Grill Souvlaki (beef, chicken and lamb), with rice, and lemon potatoes. A cozy little place, with a fantastic atmosphere. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"So after an hour of boxing, I decided to regain all the calories burnt by hitting up Plaka. \"Since we are in the South anyway\" was the justification.  We were the only ones at 7:30pm on a Monday night. I had checked out the menu online beforehand (shhh) and knew I wanted to order the Dinner Platter for Two for me and my man. And we did.  We waited, ravenously hungry. When the food came, I literally jumped in. One bite of calamari. Mmm delicious. One taste of tzatziki. Mmm tasty. One bite of beef souvalki, one bite of chicken souvlaki... Mmm not bad. I was all over the damn platter. Yum. The spanakopita was amazing, as was the moussaka. In fact, I hogged the entire moussaka and gave none to my dining partner.  Service was meh. I asked for 2 big plates for us to put our food on, instead of the tiny side plates we had on the table, and she looked confused, then shrugged her shoulders and went \"Well this is how the Greeks eat. But okay I will get you the big plates.\" I was thinking UMM not really. I am PRETTY sure I have had a fair bit of greek meals, being that my boyfriend and his family is Greek and I have never been served ANYTHING ona small side plate.  But, I kept my thoughts to myself. I was hungry, and I just wanted to eat. I have never had fantastic service in a Greek restaurant anyway.   I would give it a 3.5. I would go back, because I loved the food. If the service is a little bit better next time, I will bump this up to a 4."}
{"text":"Each time we go it's not very busy which I don't understand because the good is delicious and they are always so friendly!! Come on people give these guys a chance!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food, at cheap prices  Lamb chops 3 were excellent served with a Greek salad for $12   Lemon Garlic shrimp 6 ditto  Greek salad was especially good   Drop by, hidden sort of behind Target"}
{"text":"I went to the Plaka for the first time with my mom and sister earlier this week, and I have to say that this is another one of those incredible deep south Calgary unexpected finds. I've recently discovered my great love for Greek food, and through yelp, Plaka ended up on my radar.   Instead of ordering separate meals, we decided to split multiple appetizers to share. We started with saganaki and pita bread. So. Incredibly. Good. Cheese + liquor + bread = wonder food. Honestly, what's not to like? We then had humous and Kopaniste dips. The kopaniste was exception with the perfect blend of garlic and roasted red peppers. We proceeded to share Spanokopita, which was also very good.  The only disappontment of our meal was the baklava, which I probably wouldn't order again. The rest, however, I will most definitely be back for!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for lunch yesterday due to the recommendations of my fellow Yelpers. It is a tucked away gem of a place that really does as the owner Yianni,  says, \"serve the best Greek food\" when he brought us the menus. I told him that I have had some mighty tasty Greek food in Chicago, so I am looking forward to tasting what he has to offer. We ordered the lunch platter, which has all the Greek goodies like spanakopita, calamari, dolmates, triopta, betteki and tzatziki. It really is a complete meal in itself, but since I love moussaka and lamb I had to order them too, to split between us. After eating all these wonderful dishes to see if this really was the best Greek food any where as Yianni had said earlier. I had to tell him he was speaking the truth, that it was wonderful. The moussaka was simply spectacular with all its spices and flavor just bursting with each bite you take. The lamb looks so simply cooked, yet it is so tender, succulent  and the spices the chef uses just enhance the meat making each bite taste wonderful. In short, what a great place!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem of a Greek restaurant. Staff is super friendly, it's been around forever.  Calamari was really good, not at all over cooked, just right. We each ordered a Souvlaki with Pita, one had lamb and the other chicken I think.  The desert we shared was Deep Fried Crusted Ice Cream with honey drizzle."}
{"text":"This Restaurant is a totally lucky find. On a VERY quiet Monday evening my wife and I decided to treat ourselves to supper. Since this was our first visit we thought to try the house red. Our waiter was very polite, professional, and very knowledgeable as to the menu. My wife had a beef souvlaki plate which came with a generous portion of perfectly done (medium rare). Beef served with rice, lemon roast potatoes, vegetables and most of all..tzatziki...my meal was with the same sides but also included chicken, lamb and greek meatballs. With apologies to the menu I cannot remember the greek names but I can honestly say this was THE BEST Greek restaurant we have encountered in 15 years in Calgary. The price is right, the music, ambience and food all blend together into a rare dining experience."}
{"text":"Efharisto Plaka!!  I had dinner here with a guest last night - our first visit - this little gem was recommended by a friend. Located in a mini mall, the restaurant is small, maybe seating 50 people. Blue & White, kind of kitschy decor (it's a good thing I like kitsch :)) - It's typically Greek with warm lighting and upbeat contemporary Greek music playing throughout. I was surprised to see only three other tables in the room, as a cheery man named Yanni showed us to a table.  We had the main course platter for two, couldn't believe it was only $50! The Calamari was delicious and the perfect texture, our Souvlaki was also very nice; tender and seasoned well. The platter came with a huge portion of Spanakopita (my fave) which was perfect. Fresh & flavourful cheese, nice & hot, with crispy pastry. Droooool :)) Last but not least, the Moussaka - Spiced Beef, Fresh Vegetables (aubergine/egg plant, zucchini/courgette, potato) and the yummiest béchamel style topping. TO DIE FOR.  The last time I had such a delicious meal of this style, was in Greece on the island of Rhodes (Rodos) in 2001.  Yanni was thrilled when we told him this, and made us promise to return... Authentic service, delicious food, VERY good prices.  We will most definitely return, Yanni! Opa!  KLM"}
{"text":"I love the food but wish there were more gluten free options.  Food is very good but a little pricey for my budget.  I've been to other Greek restaurants that can make saganaki gluten free but this is not available here. It would be great if it was an option.  Service is also great, has a lovely family run feel to it."}
{"text":"I've never tried this Greek restaurant before.  I thought I would try this place out for Mother's Day.  I was able to book a table using OpenTable so it was nice and simple.  Our server was nice and friendly.  That's pretty much the extent of it.  1)  Google maps has this place pinned wrong.  Our GPS kept telling us to go by the Co-Op and we finally decided to search for it on our own.  We found it across the street by the Target.  2)  Our food took over 40mins to come out after ordering.  It's a good thing we ordered their appetizers.  3)  The server asked me if I wanted another ginger-ale and without informing me, she charged me for the extra drink.  Most places would give you a heads up in case you think it's a free refill... Add $3.  4)  For 6 of us we ordered: 2 appetizers, pita bread, 4 soft drinks (should have been 3), 2 glasses of wine and 6 entrees.  Our bill after tax and gratuity came out to $226.  5)  I ordered the roast lamb and what came out was a few bite sized chunks of lamb that was over cooked, dry and lacking flavour.  This was supposed to be their \"special dish\".  My wife ordered the lamb chops and hers were dry as well.  I've never had bad lamb at a Greek restaurant until I went to Plaka.  The worst part is all our entrees were in the $20~25 range.  6)  The vegetables that came with our dish; unappealing green beans cooked in some sort of tomato and onion puree.  The green beans were like mush and tasted like it came from a can or was cooked from frozen.  7)  Menus were sticky and looked like they had not been wiped down in years.  The walls had lots of dust and the picture frames had a layer of grease.  In conclusion, because of the above points I'd have to give this place a 1-star.  I expected more for a place that charged $25 for an entree.  I've had better Greek food at a mall food court and that's no exaggeration."}
{"text":"I don't recommend I ordered 2 items off skip the dishes the shrimp with butter and garlic and the pita with hummus it came out to be $30! Which I was fine at first thinking since the shrimp was $15 it must be filling but nope it was literally 5 shrimps with no sides. And the pita bread was smaller and thinner than OPA for $9. I wasn't impressed I had to reorder from another restaurant"}
