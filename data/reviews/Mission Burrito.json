{"text":"I tried this place for lunch. I wouldn't go back, and I wouldn't recommend it. I ordered the chicken burrito, and it was super disappointing. It was basically rice wrapped up in a tortilla. They packed it full with rice and they were very skimpy on everything else- especially the meat, cheese, and guacamole. They spread the gauc on super thin as if it was butter. When I asked for more, I was told it would be extra. It was definitely a sad burrito."}
{"text":"The food is good, but they seriously gouge you with the toppings - you can't get extra anything (or anything on the side) without paying a premium for it. Compared to the new burrito place in the Eaton Centre (where the staff are very liberal with their toppings and have given me as many free sides of toppings as I want) this place is stingy (and about the same price).  Also, they need some better way to gauge how spicy you want your food. I love spicy food, but I've had varying levels of spice upon asking for \"spicy\" there (from medium/mild to so ridiculously spicy that it's hard to eat)."}
{"text":"Rounded up from 3.5 / 5.  Another good burrito option for T.O.  I like that they went outside of the standard (local) box and steam the burrito instead of grilling it, which is nice to have for a change, and arguably (it seems it depends who you ask) more authentic, at least to the Mission district in San Fran.  It was a bit of a walk from the core for lunch, but it was worth it.  The size was good, and competes with the bigger burritos around.  Chicken was tasty, and the hot sauce was good and spicy.  The rest of the ingredients seemed fresh and well integrated.  Maybe a little bit bland compared to some others.  Overall it was a good experience, and I left happy.  My only real complaint was that (true to the style) the tortilla got a bit chewy and sticky toward the end, but it never got rubbery or stale.  That's no better or worse than getting an extra crispy bite of a grilled burrito in my opinion, so enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place once was great but not anymore.  Got chicken burrito that was dried out and tasted funny.  The guy who made my burrito was very stingy about toppings."}
{"text":"The server put on old, wet gloves from under the counter before she started :( I think it would have been more sanitary for her to just wash her hands and forego the gloves. Too bad because the food is pretty decent.  If paying by credit card for a total under $10 there is an addition $0.25 charge."}
{"text":"It's been on my to try list for ages, and I finally made good on it! Perhaps it's because I've been waiting that it seemed a bit underwhelming but I found the burrito to be sub par.   The prices are on the high end considering the product being served is minimalist. I ordered their 5 dollar special spicy beam burrito and found that outside of the novel texture of a steamed burrito, it wasn't all that interesting for the taste buds      They don't even include vegetables in the burrito unless you pay extra and you can forget about guac!! Honestly I will only be a one time customer and can only use this visit as a been there done that visit.  Sorry Mission Burrito, but I am not going to be missioning down to the village for you.  They charge a fee for debit and credit for purchases under $10. ($0.25)"}
{"text":"I heard lots of good things about this place but was disappointed. The tortilla reminded me of the microwave burritos from the supermarket. That just made it fail right there.   I won't even start with the contents. With a name like Mission, I was hoping for more. Taco Bell is twice as good, twice the size and half the price.  Note - this was in November 2008. I don't know if it's changed from then but I don't want to risk it and waste my time and money the next  time in Toronto.  http://www.flickr.com/photos/ifindoubt/3009086559/"}
{"text":"Ordered a steak and chicken once - it was good but it fell apart.   Ordered a large steak another time - the steak was terrible, way too much fat, off flavour."}
{"text":"I've had a few burritos from Mission Burrito and have never been disappointed.  The chicken burrito is my favourite.  They offer various spice levels, but even the hottest isn't that hot.  The burritos are prepared fairly quickly and the prices are very reasonable.  I have yet to figure out their hours so getting a burrito from Mission Burrito is a game of chance.  I'm very impressed with how the single employee handles the stress of a line-up."}
{"text":"OK, I think Mission finally found their groove. Enough rice to soak up the bean, pork-free black beans, standard guac, sour cream and extras.  I really felt like I was back in SF.  The tightly wrapped tortilla was perfectly steamy and transformed the shrimp burrito into a bundle of joy! The salsa is also bang on- just the right amount of heat! Thanks for keepin' it real Mission style."}
{"text":"ok, so I have been several times...it was always just ok, but not terrible...today I got 2 chicken burritos to go and NEITHER one had ANY chicken inside...epic fail!..."}
{"text":"I don't like places that would charge you more if you need to use a credit card. if you need to get something for under $10 at Mission Burrito, you will have to pay an extra $0.25 if you use a credit card. (-1 star here)  my first time here, had my eyes on their combo, a burrito plus salsa with chips, and a Mexican soda for the price of burrito + $2.75. but when I order, the guy who take the order doesn't quite know what their combo offer is, after I repeat myself like 3 times, he end up charging me burrito + the special Mexican soda (for $2.0?). I hate to repeat myself when the word is a simple \"combo\"... (-1 star here)  the burrito itself was great, but I can't remember anything else about it... :P  Recently they have this Grilled Chicken Burrito special for $5.25, this time the girl who serves me does know better, she would ask me if I wanted to add sour cream / guacamole to the burrito for $0.50 more, and I did add guacamole as I like guacamole.  3 stars."}
{"text":"I still drop by here for a sweet potato burrito almost everytime I'm in the area and can vouch that they've improved their hours since my last review."}
{"text":"Tried the yummy sweet potato and black bean burrito last night and waited what should be an obligatory 24hrs before doing mexican fast food reviews. I'm happy to report that this is a damn good and tasty burrito by Toronto standards.  I'm only giving this place 3* instead of 4 because I take issue with their \"after 7pm any burritos for $5\" promotion. The regular size bean and sweet potato burrito is $4.85... what? Of the 3 vegetarian burrito options only the Grilled Vegetable burrito costs more than $5 and frankly when I want a burrito, I don't want it to contain the contents of every vegetarian sandwich ever so I'm never going to order that.  I asked if I could have the large size which is $5.85 (same price as the regular size meat burritos that are discounted after 7) for $5 but I was denied. I think they are trying to get rid of the day's old seafood and meat with this deal but I find it discriminatory."}
{"text":"Ordered a large chicken Turned out to be quite small compared to close rivals (chipotle, big fat burrito) +Pros +Guac comes built into the price. +the price maybe reasonable/competitive  depending on what you're comparing it  to  -Cons -the size I ordered a large it would be considered a small at rival burrito joint l -Protein portion was small - Carbs (rice and bean paste) to vegetables(lettuce salsa and corn)  ratio WAY OFF for my pallet (again comparing to other rivals) it was too salty and overly starchy tasting and because of the lack of vegetables there was no crunch factor that get get from biting into the fresh lettuce you get from the vegetable side.   Value paid: 6/10 Taste 3/10 Quality of ingredients 7.5/10 Luckily Hood to return: Definitely not Would recommend: No"}
{"text":"There are tons of better burrito places around but this place does fill you up As for taste it's decent. Very average food here. Sometimes they have deals which brings the price down to give you more bang for your buck.   Place usually is never busy so you get your food made pretty fast."}
{"text":"Mmmm Burritos.  I never knew how much I loved you until I moved back to Toronto to find this entire burrito culture.  Burrito is so the new pizza.  This place is really really tasty.  I can't remember which version of a vegetarian burrito I had but it was delicious.  One warning - to avoid food babies you should definitely opt for the smaller size.  The large is just unnecessary burrito-ness.  Very worth checking out - especially if you are visiting the AGO or OCAD."}
{"text":"I had a chicken burrito from Mission Burrito today and I have to say that it was a definite thumbs-in-the-middle experience. The ingredients all seemed about as fresh as one would expect from a food court burrito stand but there was an overall lack of flavour. The colour of the rice suggested that it was seasoned but I couldn't discern any and a small but noticeable portion of the rice was hard and dried out. The chicken on the burrito was shredded, which is definitely better than ground, but when I have a burrito I much prefer the texture of whole pieces of chicken. I enjoy spicy, flavourful food but not hot-for-the-sake-of-hot. Since this was my first time ordering from Mission Burrito, I went with the medium heat. If I eat there again I'll go for hot as their medium was tame by my standards. I did like the fact that they don't charge extra for guacamole which is something every other burrito place in Toronto I've been to does. The portion size is also very adequate. I ordered a large burrito and a Jarrito's soda and it came to under $10 before the 25 cent Interac fee, which is another strike. It's 2010. People use Interac. Stop with the gouging. Overall, apart from the dried out rice which may be due to the fact that I ordered just after the lunch rush, there was nothing wrong with their food; I just found it a little bland."}
{"text":"Tasty stuff right here!  I had the large pork burrito with everything, except cilantro (because cilantro is from the devil's garden).  The flavors were well blended and the tortilla was packed full of meaty/ricey goodness.  My only complaint is that they were a little skimpy on the guac.    Their main entrance is via the food court but they do have street access into a small standing area.  They have lots of different options other than burritos and they have a $5 student special for those on a tight budget."}
{"text":"I love the burritos at this place!!  They are loaded with great toppings and very flavourful. The hot sauce is HOT and delicious! I've had both the steak and chicken and both were top notch.  I think it's a bit overpriced however, For a regular size burrito its close to 8 dollars and its SMALL. Service has always been good for me, and very friendly and they actually pay attention to the toppings you've requested and declined.  Good spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place has been getting on my nerves recently, so I can no longer call myself \"a fan.\" A list of recent gripes:  1. Waiting thirty (30) minutes for an order as the sole working employee plodded through a few orders. Mid afternoon is no time to be working solo. Half an order for fast food is INSANITY.  2. Getting a mere Odwalla here is a hassle. Two nested tales of woe:   a) On one visit I was bluntly told \"no, we don't have any\" in the tone you would address a six-year-old that is repeatedly asking for cookies. When I got to the other side of the counter to pick up my order, I saw a bunch in the other fridge. I didn't say anything, not wanting to prolong my customer service experience here.  b) The second time I was told they were out of Odwalla (today, albeit more politely), I *did* say something when I got to the other side of the counter and noticed a fridge full of bottles. (Unopened packages even. Like, I can't even believe that I am even talking about this right now. Anyway.) The response was not a friendly offer to ring one up for me, but a \"nobody told me\" coupled with a shrug. Dude, *I* told you. Can someone get me a flipping Odwalla? Please?  3. Soft tacos are not to be ordered.  I'm still liking the vegan plate which is a lot of food for $10 and comes with killer corn chips, but I'll send my butler to pick up instead."}
{"text":"Great new burrito place in the OCAD/AGO neighbourhood. It's located in the food court on McCaul just south of Dundas and offers both meaty and veg options. The fillings choices are great (I had black bean and sweet potato) and I'm really happy that they now offer both bean fillings in vegetarian versions (the pinto bean filling used to be made with pork fat, but no longer)."}
{"text":"I'm typing this as Im trying to eat this bean and cheese burrito. This is possibly the worst burrito I've ever had. It's completely tasteless. The only thing I taste is the sour sauce (is it supposed to be lime?!) theyve doused this burrito in. Are those banana peppers?? Why is rice mushy?!? Why doesn't it taste like anything!!!!  What a waste of money. Should have just got McD's next door."}
{"text":"I did love this place till I went today , and my bf went last week and he did like it either . It's gone down hill ! The burrito I had today was like eating pure salt ,, yuck !"}
{"text":"The burrito here was big and filling, but that is about all I can say about it.  I wouldn't say it tasted amazing, just that it filled my empty stomach. It was also way too gooey at the bottom. You know how you get to the end of your burrito and its just gross because all of the juices of the various ingredients have gathered into one spot? Well, it was like that, but flooding over the wrap and onto my hands like an overflowing toilet."}
