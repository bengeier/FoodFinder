{"text":"I just tried this place last week.  The quality and value is hard to beat.  Recommended.  

Though I wish you could order online."}
{"text":"Ignore Jonathan, he is from an evil cabal of Papa John's zealots (surely...) attempting to disrepute an amazing up-and-coming pizza chain.

I went to Pizza Bogo for the first time several nights ago and haven't been able to get it off my mind since. They recommended the Latina to me (chicken, black beans, tortilla strips, mango etc.) and, by God, it was the most rewarding pizza experience I've ever had--and coming from me, a self-proclaimed gourmand, that is saying a lot.

Their roster of global pizzas is unique and leaves one wanting to come back and try another, if not out of sheer curiosity. Their list of ingredients is so wide one can't help but be impressed.

Now, I don't know what their prices typically are, but at the time of my purchase they were offering large pizzas for $5.95 on Tuesday and Wednesday nights (vunderbar!). I believe that their prices are much more, and I'd be surprised if they weren't given the quality. Let this be one downside.

Another downside is the waiting time for their pizzas, they are longer than what you'd normally expect from a pizza chain. No matter, no matter. I would rather wait 20% longer for a pizza that is 100% superior!"}
{"text":"Pizza Bogo is a great Hudson take-out pizza parlor. Located in Acme shopping center, it is convenient to most Hudson residents. The pizza they serve here is great. The last time I got pizza from here, I ordered the Milano pizza. It was excellent. Their are many great pizzas here, but if you want to create your own, you can. Overall, if you're in Hudson and want pizza, get Pizza Bogo. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good but they routinely screw up our orders. By routinely I mean almost every single time we order. Check your pizza carefully when you pick it up because chances are the high schooler who took the order screwed it up."}
{"text":"Their pizza and chicken tenders are excellent but the pepperoni rolls are absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"The prices have gone sky high.
Unbelievable
Way to kill your business, guys
Not even close to being worth these prices."}
{"text":"Let me explain. The price on non sale days is way too high. $18 for a large ?
The pizza is very good. Sweeter sauce which we like.
Tuesday and Wednesday is $5.95 for any large including, the specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"I randomly thought of how good this place was back when I lived in Ohio. It deserves more reviews especially if its still as good as it was 4 years ago. I like the deal where you can get a large any topping pizza for $5."}
{"text":"Called several times and stayed on the line for a few good minutes. Don't go to PizzaBOGO bc, one, they will not answer their phones, two, at $22 youre not really getting one free. You're just paying for two pizzas, and three, everyone there is a pretentious sack of dicks. Or at least the ones in Hudson, Ohio.

{"text":"Very overpriced. Phone service is rude. I think her name was Bri? She forgot my garlic butter for my pepperoni rolls- the bread was so dry that I couldn't even eat them alone. Ended up feeding them to the squirrels in my backyard. Asked for the situation to be fixed, but was told that I should've double checked when I ordered. Truly upset by the customer service here- definitely ordering from dominos next time-- too many pizza places in this town anyways."}
