{"text":"Boy ole boy, this place rocks me every time I go there. It more than helps if you know some spanish, or do your homework. Otherwise all your questions will be answered like your partially deaf grandparents, 'head shaking yes...', by the short central american ladies.
I had the, Pollo Catracho-Pollo Frito Estilo Hondureño, on my last venture in there with real genuine horchata. I rolled out of the place literally. They do not miss a beat with sides and fresh condiments. For the gringos, there is the typical bottles of sauces and such. But WTF you need that for when you can eat the roasted jalepeno, onions and radishes. Damn. I have yet to go there for breakfast, because I usually want to do something in the morning rather than go back to sleep. lol. Now you know why they have them images of the mexican having a siesta on the cactus. The dude just ate here!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC, been looking for a latin flavor since El Patron closed and may have found it, great menu , great prices, check it out."}
{"text":"Food is great food is authentic and the service is nice. Nothing wrong at all. My fav place. I'm gonna try the fuego pupusas today"}
{"text":"Incredible Pupusas!! We loved the bean, pork and cheese, but also the loroco flower! Very filling, I could eat so many but stopped at two. LOL"}
{"text":"While a much broader diversity of world eat's is sometimes lacking in the greater Mesa area, there is zero lack in diversity of Latin and Hispanic influenced food.  Salvadoreno definitely stands out based on its uniqueness (it's 1 of 1 restaurant serving Salvadorian cuisine in Mesa, and accounts for 3 of the 5 noted Salvadorian places in Phx). 

Everything on the menu looks pretty great, but I decided on the 3 Pupusa Combo (1 steak w/cheese, 1 chicken w/cheese, & 1loroco flower w/cheese).  With the rice & beans, this makes for a sizable meal.  Each of the Pupusas was a little different, and topping them off with a little bit of the provided spiced tomato sauce and pickled cabbage, onions, & carrot mixture made the flavors even better.  Combined with a Mexican Coke, my total was around 10 bucks.

I'm definitely looking forward to heading back for the tamals, and homemade flan!"}
{"text":"Delectable! Pupusas revueltas are a personal favorite. They are always made fresh and served to perfection. You'll become a long time patron, no doubt!"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic food! We go all the time because their papusas are the best around and for a great price!"}
{"text":"I order papusas here at work every Thursday! One papusa is $1! Amazing deal! The ladies are really nice and the food is always so delicious!"}
{"text":"After reading the positive reviews I decided to give this place a try. By no means am I a Salvadorean food expert but I do like Pupusas. 

I decided to try the chicken, cheese and combo Pupusas. Now comes the reason I gave the place 4 stars--the food had excellent taste but based on previous pupusa experiences these seemed a bit soggy. The portions are great and again I say the food prep and flavors were excellent. 

A nice side if beans and rice completed my meal. I did indulge in a prepackaged flan and it was meh! 

I would recommend this place based on the friendly service and great taste. Might retry and eat in and see if that makes a difference in texture. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Salvedoreno since 2006. I don't get downtown as much anymore but they still remember me! Best papusas I've ever had. I also recommend the flautas. This really is one of Las Vegas' best hole in the wall hidden gems."}
{"text":"I went and ordered two pupusas to go. I specifically asked for them to be bean and loroco (I am lactose and tolerant). when I got home I saw they had cheese, I called them to let them know and they didn't offer to give me my money back or to give me a free meal or new pupusas. The lady on the phone (who took my order) said she would tell the cooks and that was all. Customer service is trash there, never going again."}
{"text":"Initially I went to this place for the tamales which were recommended by a coworker who is from El Salvador. Someof the people in my office also said that they were amazing (and I trust their opinions).  So I went in looking forward to that and ended up ordering all the pupusas as well. I must say I'm not a big fan of the tamales, they are too moist for my taste. The banana leaves do give a great flavor though. The true stars are the pupusas, which I had never had before and have since become addicted too. I literally order at least 6 for myself every time I go now. They are asininely delicious!!! I grab a large bite of pupusa and some of the curtido (a kind of slaw-ish awesomeness) and just chow down. Beware the post-lunch coma though as eating that many will knock the average person on their ass. This brings me to my one bone to pick with this stripmall gem, their coffee sucks! I was expecting super-strong coffee with mud at the bottom when I ordered the cafe listo but it tasted like gas station coffee. They didn't even have any milk, just powdered non-dairy nonsense...

I'm already a diehard fan but if they stepped up the coffee I would pretty much call it my mecca. This is the kind of food that makes all seem right with the world...

Holy Shit!!! I almost forgot about the ceviche! It's a little pricey but it is soooo worth it. I split it with one of my people at work and ended up sharing it with the whole office......very much against my will. People thought it looked so good they just kept poaching forkfulls off my plate. Definietly a must have dish"}
{"text":"although this location is no longer open, i LOVE the food here. i do wish they spoke more english though...."}
{"text":"My favorite Pupusas are revueltas, frijol con queso, chicharron con queso these are bomb. The churusca is delicious. This is the OG place to get Salvadorean food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service at a great price. It doesn't get any better than Salvadoreno. Well done, I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great authentic El Salvador food! A hole in the wall restaurant with home style cooking. If you like pupsas this is your spot! 
P.S. The horchata is homemade!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because is close to my house. I am sad to report I was not impress. 
These is what i order:

2 corn tamales with cream (very delicious)
4 pupusas ( the pupusas were delicious but the curtido and salsa were awful not spicy or tasty at all). If you are a fan of this kind of food the curtido is so important and it was so bad that it tasted old.
2 horchatas (it tasted more like water with sugar) they could do a better job at this. 

I would go back to this place for corn tamales only."}
{"text":"I went to the new location located on Gilbert and Broadway and wasn't thoroughly impressed. A friend and I went to try pupusas for the first time, and while the food was quite good, the service was definitely sub-par. We each ordered 3 pupusas, which are relatively inexpensive, and coke in a glass bottle to top it off (always a plus). Anyways, my first two pupusas were quite good, but they messed up on my chicken pupusa and did not include any chicken (just cheese). After explaining this to the waitress, she refused to help me or take back my order. She just explained that there is very little meat in a pupusa and I must have ate it all in the first two bites. 

Also, the employees speak very broken english, so communication can be a struggle unless you are a spanish-speaker."}
{"text":"Food was solid. I had the typical plate which included a steak, tasted like top sirloin to me good flavor but steak was overcooked and tough. The rice and red beans was really good and I enjoyed the flour thick tortilla. The coleslaw was tasteless and I could have done without it. The papusa was good although other than a bit of cheese pretty similar to the tortilla. The grilled plantain tasted good but was dry. The pilesener beer hit the spot though. Chips were standard, salsa was bland but overall cannot complain for an $8.99 dinner and $3 beers. 

The inside although reminiscent of a old drug store, and probably was at some point had nicer table and chairs than I expected taking into account the location on Main St. and the scary little motel parking lot where it was situated. 

I am glad I tried it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again with so many other places in LV to try."}
{"text":"Chili Relleño...YES PLEASE!!! This place is amazing! I had it delivered last week and the toddler tore it to pieces. He polished off rice, beans, chips and a pupusa!! I had the chili relleno plate (how I gauge Mexican food restaurants) and it is, by far, the best chili relleno plate I've had in the states. The food overall is on point! I've been trying to get the wife to go ever since. She's a total foodie but has been incredibly reluctant to try this place out for some reason. Well folks, today was the day she finally said yes. She had the huevos rancheros (her method) and then the bedroom eyes appeared. She was lost in her meal. She was totally impressed. She couldn't stop talking about how authentic the food was. She began rambling about past trips down south and how El Salvador is now bumped to the list of priority designations. Score!! Service was nice. Facility clean. Server brought me a sample of 'horchata' which is similar to, but quite different than, Mexican horchata. They've won many awards and there's a good reason why!! Yes the food takes time to cook...because it's actually being cooked. People docking stars for the time it takes to prepare a hot fresh meal should stick with fast food. It's a shame that businesses like this get lower ratings for doing things the right way. Salvadoreno, there's a special place for you in our hearts :)"}
{"text":"I thought that because is the same owner than the location on Southern & Mesa Dr was going to be the same.  Unfortunately, the service/attention  was not good at this location :(. When I mentioned to my other family members they also experienced the same. Not good service."}
{"text":"Pupusas are awesome. Tried all five, chicken, pork, and carne asada were my favorite."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for over 30 years and it is always the best in town. I've tried other Salvadorian restaurants and they just don't cook with the Love as this location does. Family owned & operated"}
{"text":"The pupusas are delicious and the staff is great at this Salvadoran restaurant.  I love coming here. 

Las pupusas Estan ricas de este restaurante salvadoreño . Los camareros y el servicio también está bien. Siempre me Gusta venir a comer aki."}
{"text":"We went to Las Vegas to celebrate my mom's birthday. The day before we left LV, we decided to stop by a Salvadoran restaurant to eat pupusas. We found this one place and I have to say that the service was excellent; very good attention, though they took very long to bring the food to our table. Anyhow, the food was very good. The pupusas had a good taste and the \"yuca Frita\" was very good. We spent a pleasant time there."}
{"text":"Young girl at the register is disrespectful and rude. She was too busy with her face glued to her phone to take my to go order. Chairs were also up 30 mins before closing and no one offered me a chair to sit while I waited. When my food came out she just set it on the counter and said \"heres your food\". I got up and grabbed my food, said thank you, and no response from her. Service left a very bad taste in my mouth. Which is sad since the food was pretty good, only reason i am leaving 2 stars. Would not return due to bad service. What a shame."}
{"text":"I had the pupusa with asada and cheese. It was delicious. I've had pupusa's many times before and these definitely satisfied my craving. The food was awesome. My girl had machaca and it was delicious. The service was good and the wait time for the food wasn't bad either. The place is a bit small so make sure you pick a table next to someone sexy, cause you might end up sitting very close to a stranger."}
{"text":"Simply the best pupusas in the valley. If you love pupusas, this is the place. If you don't know what pupusas are, stop what you are doing (right now) and run as fast as you can (seriously) to this place.  Your life will not be the same (I'm not kidding)!  
    I prefer the pupusas revueltas (beans,chicharrones, cheese) and be sure to try them with the curtido and salsa (that's the traditional way). 
    The tamales are delicious too, especially with a little crema on top. For a truly unique experience, try the horchata!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here, I was looking forward to trying great Salvadorean food.  My experience, however, was very disappointing.  While the waitress was friendly, the service was very slow.  We waited a while for drinks, refills, take out boxes, and finally the check.  I would have overlooked the slow service if the food had made up for it.  Unfortunately, it didn't!!!

My sister and I shared the appetizer sampler plate and the shrimp & chicken entree.  We enjoyed the papusas, fried plaintain, and fried taro, but were disappointed with everything else.  The pork and chicken were so dried they could have been called jerkey.  The salsa was bland and tasteless.  The empanadas were so hard you could have seriously hurt someone with them.

To add insult to injury, the prices were pretty high for a hole in a corner place.  Lunch for 2  totaled over $40 (tip included).  We could have gone to more than a dozen other places for better food at lower prices.  Needless to say, we will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The service is slow.  I saw the 2 waitress carrying 2 bowls at a time.  I ordered chicken and mix (pork and beef) Pupusa's, but the only thing I can taste is the cheese.  My daughter ordered chicken that looked good but was raw inside. Call their attention to fix it. They re-fried the chicken but man it comes out overcooked.  The chicken is really hard and my daughter lost interest in the food.  Not everything was bad. I like their refried beans."}
{"text":"First let me say I have had no experience with El salvador food, but have heard good reviews about it. It may be that it is just not my taste. I want to just base it on preparations and quality of the food. I had the pupusas which is the signature dish I was told in their country. To be honest, it seems like a quesadilla to me except the tortilla is different in texture, mine was a little grainy almost like corn meal. I ordered chicken, beef and just cheese. The chicken and beef had very little chicken or beef and mostly you taste the beans and cheese. Really had no flavor to them except the cheese. The cheese pupusas was exactly like a cheese quesadilla because had no beans in it and except for the texture, It would be a quesadilla. The salsa is very thin and a liquid like water. It really had no strong taste like a regular salsa. the topping of cabbage was okay, like a slaw of some sort.  The sides were rice and beans which was really bland and I only had a couple of bites of it. 

The other item I tried was the pastelitos with steak. The outside was so greasy, I could not even swallowed it. I dried them off with 5 to 6 napkins before I could take another  bite and it was so bland and dry, no seasoning at all  and just tasted the oil and probably old oil at that . 

I don't think I would go here again, but maybe I will try the food maybe another dish or dishes, but again maybe it is just not my cup of tea but the quality of the food  seems pretty plain or subpar."}
{"text":"The food is overall really good. Every time I have gone in, the employees have always been very friendly. I have also gone to another one of their locations and the food and service was great as well. The food does take a bit to make but it is very good. I would say that there are a few over priced items on the menu but other than that, the food is affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"Servicio malísimo , se que el está en southern ave y mesa dr son de la misma cadena y nada que ver con esta locación y tanbien el de la 75 ave y la Thomas  aya suelen ser más amables y la comida más rica en general , la cajera al contestar el teléfono como que siempre tiene afán y no sabe tratar a un cliente creo que el dueño debería  recordarle que come de nosotros los consumidores !"}
{"text":"The only reason I give 2 stars is because the food was delicious. To start off right when we walked in the ladies working in the back were very loud. Yelling and singing . When I walked in a little family didn't look like they were enjoying their food with a staff in the back being so noisy. The lady taking our orders wasn't even paying much attention as she kept eavesdropping the loud ladies in the kitchen. After we were served our food , a group of men were standing outside and you hear 2 servers saying loudly \" are they coming in or not!?\" Please keep those remarks to yourself and let us customers eat in peace!"}
{"text":"Absolutly loved this place! Service excellent, food amazing yummy! I had the best chorizo ever so mouth watering sooo good. I cant wait to go back. It looks kinda not cool from the out side but when you enter is real good. You wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Wow, not what we were expecting at all. But that's a good thing. The restaurant would qualify as a \"Dive\" in most circles, a tiny 20 seat affair with recycled refer units as cabinets located in the corner of a strip mall with a 99 cent store and a BigLots. Not exactly a high-end neighborhood.

But after having heard of this little cafe in The New Times and finding that Phoenix Magazine rated their Ceviche and Shrimp salad as one of the Valley's top 50 dishes, we decided that we must give it a try! The article in New Times raved about something called a Pupusa and description sounded familiar, once we were there I realized why.

Every culture on earth seems to have developed some form of stuffed hand pie. You know the formula, a regional bread or pastry dough, formed into a pocket and stuffed with savory or sweet fillings. Food on the go. Well in El Salvador it's called a Pupusa, and they were delicious!

A kind of thick corn tortilla type bread, filled with several different types of  fillings, pork and cheese, beans, chicken and cheese, beef and cheese or beef, bean and cheese.

Now this is NOT your typical Arizona/Mexican food. The cheese is a freshly made cheese that is a Salvadoran tradition and is one of the best fresh cheeses I have ever had, smooth and soft yet very flavourful. The tortilla is not what you might be used to either, they are corn tortillas but they are not the course chip like corn tortillas so prevalent in Americanized Hispanic foods. They are thick, soft and delicious. It is this tortilla that is the basis of their Pupusas.

Don't expect to find the standard \"Mexican Restaurant\" re-fried beans here either. Spicy, flavourful and smooth, having been mashed right after cooking, they are among the best example of simple yet wonderful tastes you will experience here.

We had some of all of the different Pupusas offered on the menu which are priced very reasonable indeed, and were impressed with all of them, though the pork and cheese and the bean were my personal favorites.

We also had a corn tamale that was sweet and moist and tasty, rolled in a banana leaf instead of the corn husk we are used to. Perhaps that is why it was so much more moist than your average corn tamale.

To finish off our repast we enjoyed the fried plantains, actually an appetizer on the menu, they were crispy on the outside and starchy and tasty inside. Served with freshly made salsa and the Salvadoran version of Crème Fraîche that was also a hit.

The owner was our server and I am still not sure she spoke much English, but she was very nice to us and the orders were always right. As well as very very hot! I had to let my Pupusas sit a few minutes before they were cool enough to consume, and a word of warning, Plantains retain heat even better than potatoes do so proceed carefully.

As I've said the Ceviche and Shrimp salad is an award winner and the Carne Asada that the folks at the next table had ordered looked delicious. However I could not ask their opinion as they did not seem to speak English either and my Spanish is worse than terrible. But they seemed to be enjoying it, I'll give it a try next time.

They serve breakfast too and I can hardly wait to give that a try as well.

Stop in, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Oml this food tastes like crap!!!The waitress is so damn slow!!They should get someone faster!It is also in a really bad area!!The food is disgusting.Dont recommend it"}
{"text":"This is the best Salvadoran food ever I would come here again I tried there chile rellenos they are totally different from the Mexican version. But it was good and there drinks are good too"}
{"text":"I'll be coming back here. Ordered the 3 pupusas combo and it was beyond was I expected. I got one mixed, chicken and chicharrón. It was inhaled in under 15 min I couldn't finish the 3rd one til the following day. Lol"}
{"text":"I have been driving past this intersection for years and never knew an awesome lil restaurant sat in the corner of the over sized strip mall. 

I actually found out about this place originally at a Yelp event at the Arizona Science Center. They were handing out pupusa's. I never even heard of a pupusa before, but it was love at first bite. They handed out a coupon for buy one get one free pupusa that sat on my coupon board in the garage for almost a year. 

When Abby was mentioning she wanted to eat some pupusa's, I was thinking no way I have a coupon for a place down the road!! So last week after being too lazy to cook, we hit this lil spot up. I had a bit of trouble finding it, so it's on the southwest corner of Mesa and Southern, in the corner of the plaza. 

The inside reminded me of a mom and pop Filipino spot, except they had some Salvadoran channel instead of TFC and pictures of islands are replaced with colorful homes in El Salvador. There were some bomb looking things on the menu that we wanted to try but tonight was pupusa night so we got 6 of them with a few different stuffings. They were amazing!! Again, they turned into leftovers and still tasted hella good. The pupusa also came with some black refried bean side and some other side dish that I can't describe but was very good. 

Oh and to wash it down, they have mexican sodas so I killed that import Coke right out the bottle. 

Just like all the other mom and pop restaurants we have been visiting lately, the staff was extremely friendly and really went above and beyond. We for sure plan on going back to try more dishes and more pupusa's!"}
{"text":"The pupusas are amazing, and they're cooked fresh so it does take quite a while to get your food however it is worth the wait! I'll be bach."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever eating there. From having homemade pupusas made from my Salvadorean friends, there's where a bit salty and the salad was dry! What the heck?! Luckily I was able to use the red sauce to make up for the dryness of the salad. I ordered a side of the fried bananas and I should have checked before I paid, but she charged me for the meal! It should only have been $3 bucks for the fried bananas. Will I go there again? Hmmm...I may not and thinking of just making my own next time! Fresh and less salt! And the salad will not be dry at all!"}
{"text":"Came here with our family and there are only 5 of us. Ordered pupusas and fried plantain. It took a while before the food came out. This place is a hole in a wall but we were willing to try it out because of the good reviews here. We got our food...plantain was good. The shrimp pupusas was my fave amongst beef and pork. It was alright...had better.  We got the bill and noticed that they already included the gratuity. Coming from Vegas, I have no problem paying gratuity but for it to be included on the bill for 5 people?  That's unheard of. So I came up to the cashier to inquire about it, one of the girl from the cashier pulled out the menu and said, \"that's our rule...six people or more we have to include gratuity\". So I stood there a little confused until I came back to our table and my sis reminded me that there are only 5 of us. So I went back and asked the cashier that there were only 5 of us so she shouldn't include the gratuity. Then all of a sudden both girls that were in the cashier counter said that the rule was changed to 4 people. Mind you...this is within 2-3 minutes time frame, their rules changed from 6 people to 4 people. When I asked why they did not mention earlier that it was changed from 6 to 5...she kept on saying \"call the manager\" and was saying this rudely."}
{"text":"Great food!  Clean, good service, reasonable price.  Second a few other comments that the exterior doesn't do justice to this gem.  Sketchy neighborhood but this place is a silver lining."}
{"text":"The last time I go to this restaurant, it seems like every time I go in they're always out of something. And that something almost always seems to be my favorite corn tamales. Not to mention the rude staff, every time something is asked of them they always make a face, forget, or take there sweet time. I saw another costumer that had to get up and ask for their side again, and when he asked the lady in the front that she forgot she told him \"I don't have four hands\". The food is good but there lack of costumer service ruins it for me. Do not recommend"}
{"text":"Decided to go here while driving through AZ. The popusas were on point regardless of the kind you get. The bisteck ensebollado was ok, not bad enough to say I won't eat it again. Definitely held up to previous reviews!"}
{"text":"If there was an option to give them 10 stars, I would. Food just like my grandmother used to make it. Pupusas are really great. Must have if you're having Salvadoran food. A regular to all their locations."}
{"text":"Great food is authentic and the service is nice. 
i been to the one at 75 ave  as well 
all around great people"}
{"text":"I love the food here, it's very authentic. Be warned that this is not the kind of place where you'll get in and out fast. The wait is always kind of long but the food is fresh. I always get a cheese and a mixed pupusa."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to this place - go! Seriously. It's amazing. It's the best little hole-in-a-rundown-strip-mall you can find. And it's cheap!

Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting, this tiny place is hidden in the corner. The owner is from El Salvador, so don't expect it to be Mexican food -- there are many similarities, but the dishes themselves are different.
Walking in, you can smell the homemade pupusas -- seriously, it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America. It's amazing. There are only a couple waitresses, and I don't think they speak much English, but the menu is in pictures, as well as in Spanish and some English, so you should do just fine.

Get the pupusas - they're like thick, hand-made tortillas stuffed with either pork, cheese and beans or, my favorite, cheese and loraco flower, which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus, to me. It's definitely the best one. These things come with salsa and some coleslaw (if they don't, just ask for the salsa) and are very filling!
The other dishes are really good, too. For a low price, you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans - and this place doesn't skimp on the fixin's. They put slices of fresh tomatoes, avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates.
I honestly LOVE it here. If you want to avoid the crowds, come at an off-hour... then you can just sit, relax and watch the telenovela on the TV in the corner. For dessert, pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register.
I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"First time trying Salvadoran cuisine and we loved it.  The pupusas were amazing as was everything we ordered.  Portion size is generous, we ordered too much!  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I am from hispanic decendency so I appreciate a good central-american-themed 'local joint'.  We went at dinner time and it was just us an another set of 'locals'.  We ordered popusas (3 or 4 different kinds) and I ordered the grilled tilapia (I can't handle that much grease).  The photo in the menu showed the tilapia REALLY large and plentiful.  What came out were 2 small (looked liked a total of ~3oz portion) fillets that were highly overseasoned with salt and some other flavors.  The handmade tortillas it came with were awesome... but that was it.  Since I had a disappointing portion of fish, I nabbed half of my husband's popusa and it was gooey and yummy but oh so greasy.  For sure I had a very upset stomach that evening from the grease.  Oh well.  So, the popusas are great if you are OK eating that much grease at once... but I don't recommend the fish just for it's over-salted flavor and misleading portion size.  I'm sure we'll return again one day in the future where I'll probably order 1 simple popusa (beans) instead of one that has too many fatty ingredients... and not the fish."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with popusas! It's a change from all the Mexican food. I ordered a cheese and a chicken popusa and it was made fresh and came out hot. Hidden in Mesa in kind of a secluded corner however."}
{"text":"Very honest food, some of the best Salvadorian food in Las Vegas.

This place has been around for a long time and with good reason. 

I went with a group and we got so much food. We tried a little bit of everything, but the pupusas were the most memorable. They were soft and warm and flavourful.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to try Salvadorian food."}
{"text":"The drive from my apartment to this restaurant along Southern Avenue is an interesting 5 mile stretch.  We start near a retirement community, replete with 70-80 year olds who have absolutely no shame in flaunting themselves in speedos on a hot summer day on thereafter desecrated sidewalks.  Continuing on, a veritable gauntlet of strip malls appear offering all types of wares, services, in a strictly lower middle income suburbia.  The next area is a heavily hispanic area with nary an English sign in sight, besides Massage brazenly displayed along shaded glass storefronts.  Finally, our destination appears, and it is truly in an imposing corner, flanked by a Big Lots, great america, and a pawn shop, complete with a watchful security guard along the storefront.  In this truly welcoming environment, we damn near sprinted from the Red Dragon ( also known as my car ) into Salvadoreno.

And this is where the magic begins.

The legend of pupusa has been ringing in my soul for nearly an hour, and I was not about to leave without satisfying that call.  Never having had it before didn't prevent me from ordering 3 varieties, with the steak being my girlfriend's favorite, mine being the pork and beans, and the simple cheese coming in at a comfortable third.  Pressed pockets of incredible goodness inside a expertly pressed tortilla, was served with a mild salsa and curtido- spicy, peppery pickled vegetables.  Combining all of these components, I have abandoned my long-standing vow to hate all those who use bumper stickers and have been inspired to promote the cause, I love (heart symbol) pupusas.  

As this was my first foray into Salvadorian food, I also ordered Lengua Guisada, which came as 3 slabs of stewed beef tongue, covered in a slightly sour tomato based sauce.  The sourness combined with the beef tongue's gamey texture I found very pleasing, but this was slightly below room temperature, and definitely marred my enjoyment of this dish.

Both of our entrees also came with pedestrian rice and watery black beans, with the latter being flavorful but far too liquidy.  I also had a cup of Sopa de Res con Chipilin with my entree, which tasted like countless other Sopa de Res elsewhere.  

Pupusas were absolutely wonderful, but the full experience was marred by my weaker entree and the side dishes.  With that said, I will gladly challenge the land of hispanic / lower income / scary gun-wielding-guard-outside-a-pawn-shop again if only I can have once again the sublime experience of pupusa once more."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It was introduced to me when  a TV show featured them and boy am I glad they did.  Don't be concerned or scared off by the atmosphere and appearance of the place.  It's not a place where you have to get dressed up! What's funny is they are almost always pretty empty,  as I am guessing a lot of people do take out but that is fine with me because that means I can find parking and a spot to sit.  Everything seems to be made to order,  so don't be in a hurry.  It is so well worth the wait.  I always go get pupusas and I make sure to get their delicious beans.  The flavor is delicious!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great. I had had pious as before, but my date hadn't. They helped me explain how things worked. Food was great. Couldn't have asked for better food or better service. Thanks guys!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place got a major face lift and it looks so much better! It was repainted and redecorated! 

Went in on a Friday night around 7:30 and it wasn't at all busy. Our server was very friendly!!!! He took our orders right away and made sure to check up on us and that we had everything we needed! 

Our food was made fresh and was good!!!! I always come here for the pupusas revueltas (pork with cheese) because they are AMAZING! I had the combo plate which includes two pupusas and comes with two sides. We also had a side of the plantains with black beans and sour cream. These were the sweetest plantains I've had!!! They were delish! Also make sure to try the tamarind drink, your taste buds will thank you!!

This will always be the place for my Salvadorian fix!"}
{"text":"If you look at the outside you wouldnt know what a gem is inside.  The decor isnt fancy but this food oh its really good.  If you want to try something different and by the way it was on $16.00 both of us to eat.  We will be back nice to support a family business that has been here for 20 yrs!"}
{"text":"I've only had take out from this place. It quickly became an office favorite when we wanted to cheaply engage in gluttony.

I usually get the 3 pupusa combo, and it always lasts me for breakfast and lunch the next day. Pretty good for under 10 bucks. They have a good selection of veggie options for the pupusas, but you had better like cheese! My favorite part is the curtido on top. Any form of pickled cabbage makes me very happy.

I wish service was a bit faster though. We usually had to call in our order about an hour ahead of time, or else the person picking it up got stuck at the restaurant awhile."}
{"text":"We had dinner here yesterday and we were the only ones dining in. The inside is nicely decorated with Salvadorian decor and plenty of plants.

We ordered the tamarind drink because this is the only place that makes it DELICIOUS. The pupusas are so full of flavor and they are made when ordered. You can definitely hear the ladies in the back making all the handmade tortillas. 

I usually get the two combo plate which comes with two pupusas with your choice of the filling and two sides. (Rice, black beans, sour cream, and cheese) I love the pork and cheese and the chicken with cheese, ugh yum. The black beans are also very flavorful with some sour cream on top! Yum. 

Our waitress was friendly and checked up on us a couple of times. They have a variety of plates on the menu and also offer large orders of pupusas. Prices are reasonable and the food is great!"}
{"text":"I remember coming to this place as a kid and after many years passed I came back and it still has that authenticity of Salvadoreño food. You can't go wrong with the pupusas (pork/cheese) and the menu offers plenty of tasty choices."}
{"text":"My friend turned me on to this place a few years ago. We stopped by for lunch today and ate some pupusas. They were delicious! The prices are great and the service is awesome. I will definitely be back again;)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. I was most impressed with the pupusas, they have a really nice texture, and the combo filling was delicious. They give you chips and hot sauce which is nice. The horchata is Salvadorian style, not Mexican style, I actually didn't realize there was a difference until I came here. The place is family owned and a Vegas staple, you should really try it if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Authentic Home Style Cooking from El Salvador with a great tasting selection of delicious items to choose from their fantastic menu. Seafood, Meats, Appetizers, Salads, Pupusas and Traditional Entrees as well as Tasty Desserts. They even provide pictures that you can see of each of the dishes on the menu. Nice!

Inside is clean and tidy with fun items on the walls that give you the sensation of being in a little tucked away place in El Salvador. The service was very friendly and helpful when I arrived and when it was time to order. I saw some photos on Brother Yelp and showed a few to her and said I want this one and one of your famous Pupusas to test out.

Ordered the Churrasco Salvadoreño plate which is Steak, Shrimp, Sausage, Black Beans and Rice, Queso Fresco, Fried Plantain, handmade Tortillas and then some. Had to get a Pupusa and asked her what she recommend. She happily replied Pork, Beans and a Cheese or Revueltas con Chicharrón,Queso y Frijoles as shown on the menu. It comes with a delicious side of spicy cabbage and a very tasty red sauce that you put on top for some extra kick. Hotter sauce also available on the table if you are crazy like me.

Everything was packed with flavors and super good. This is not your typical Mexican style food. You must check it out to experience it. In the same complex as Family Dollar store in the deep corner. Yummo!

4.5 STARS"}
{"text":"This place never ceases to disappoint! With at least 10 different pupusas to choose from, you can't go wrong! They are made fresh and are so good! Add some pickled cabbage and salsa, ooo wee!!!"}
{"text":"Yes!! I have been sneaking Salvadoran nostalgia here for several years. Besides the eye-rolling pupusas, the platanos con frijoles y crema is definitely worth it.  I am a regular appetite, 40 yr old woman & if I just order 1 pupusa, I can finish the plantain dish. :)"}
{"text":"A coworker and I went here a few weeks back...amazing! I had never had el Salvadorian food before. I am hooked. The owner was great...two white boys asking about the food and getting advice on what to order next AND he didn't skip a beat."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves fresh hot Pupusas with that delicious slaw and red sauce characteristic to the authentic Salvadoran plates. Had other pupusas before but this place takes the cake in true flavor and fresh food. It's always a plus when you can buy the Coke in a glass bottle and a homemade flan for dessert... If you have the room! Been here a few times and the food is consistently delicious. I always like to get the 3 pupusa combo that comes with slaw, red sauce and 2 sides for $8. Can't beat the leftovers either. They've got a true fan outta me."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today per my co-workers' recommendations. They told me this was the first El Salvadorian restaurant in Vegas, so it must be good since it is still open. Not located in the best area, its in the same corner as a really old motel, looks a little shady. 

The bathroom is actually outside of the restaurant, you have to ask for a key then walk outside to the back to use the restroom :)

We ordered mixed papusas which came with cabbage slaw and sauce, and an order of shrimp cocktail. The papusas were so good, soft and chewy on the inside but crunchy on the outside, lots of meat, rice and bean on the inside. The shrimp cocktail was also really good, lots of big shrimps. They also have really good horchata and a grapefruit juice drink. Very cheap too. Bill came out under $30 for 3 drinks, 6 papusas and a shrimp cocktail. 

Will definitely come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"We love the papusas!  Best in the world (well, at least in Mesa). It takes some time to make them so get comfortable and watch some telemundo or visit with your date or family. Make sure you pair them with cream and beans. You won't leave hungry or dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Salvadorian Food

Tried the Pupusa de Pollo and the Pupusa de Loroco.  At this restaurant, I preferred the chicken over the pungent flavor of the loroco herb.  Can't do spicy, so I only tasted the cabbage dish and the salsa.  To drink, I had the tamarindo."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice in three days.  My niece and I went on Sunday my suggestion after reading a review in new times. My niece decided she couldn't eat there as soon as we entered. I ordered a bean and cheese pupusa and a chili relleno. The chili relleno was stuffed with a ground or cubed meat. I didn't expect the meat so I pushed it over to my niece to nibbled on.  The pupusa was good, the beverage I ordered was super sweet.... So I went back today. Again I ordered the bean and cheese pupusa, it wasn't as good as Sundays. I also ordered a dish that was very similar to a tamale, it was wrapped in a leaf and was stuffed with cheese. IT was very good.  I also ordered the plantains with cream and beans.   The beans were very soup, traditionally so? I don't know and didn't care for them regardless.  I  have no real reference for Salvadorian food so ...  

I've had similar tamale type dishes wrapped in banana leaves, this version was very good but I must say not the best I've had. I will eventually go back to try the ceviche.   I'm not in a hurry.

I'm posting my review with a bit of reluctance.  My experience was not what I expected and doesn't fall in line with the reviews posted here or the review a read in new times.  Again my experience with Salvadorian food is limited.  So plesae consider my two cents with a bit of salt!  Peace!"}
{"text":"This is the first Salvadorian restaurant I've tried since moving to AZ. I moved here from Los Angeles about 5 months ago. I am Salvadorian, myself. 
I must say, the Pupusas are delicious! 
I ordered 3 Pupusas revueltas (Mixed with pork, cheese and beans). 
The taste of the food was so good. My complaint is that they did not seem to have beans in them. The curtido was good, I've definitely had better. The salsa was really good. The flavor was just right. Although not spicy, because it's not meant to be. 

I also had an orchata, which was good. It was authentic. 

I ordered ahead of time, since I went during lunch. My order was ready when I got there. There was parking. 
The person who helped me was friendly and attentive. 
I would definitely go back. I am excited about trying to sopas, atol de elote, and the nuegados."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty much good news all around!  If you check-in on Yelp, you'll receive 10% off your bill.  Good too, is it won't amount to much as the food is very inexpensive.

Six of us for lunch: Three ordered a sample dinner (platter) and those plates returned to the kitchen empty, leaving smiles on the faces of those who had eaten.  Two of us ordered the pupusas.  Given the great reviews how could we not!  For me...eh...the best of  three combo being the chicken.  From my friend, no complaints at all.  My husband ordered the tilapia, fried as crispy as you'll find any fish and served whole.  Again all of it gone!

Very nice people working here too!  A good place for a Saturday lunch!"}
{"text":"Great food, Sandra takes care of you every time as your first time there. Their Pupusas are great, the flavor and over all taste is like no other in Vegas. Coming from the original salvadorean Pupusas I can say this are the best in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. 

Did the two papusa lunch combo--steak and chicken-- with rice and beans. Everything was awesome, especially the chicken. I will definitely come back!

Edit: 

Came back, tried the beans and cheese.  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. It resides next to an abandoned motel that they shot parts of the movie Casino at. It's not in the best area, but don't let that deter you. The food is amazing. The mixed pupusas are my favorite; stuffed with cheese, pork and beans. I also love the fried bananas with beans and sour cream. The Plato tipico is a typical Salvadoran plate and includes steak, fried banana, cheese, rice, salsa and tortillas. I recommend trying this if you have never has this type of cuisine before because it's really delicious. Other items include burritos, empanadas, and even breakfast items like huevos rancheros. Everything I've tried has been good. 

On Tuesdays and Thursdays the mixed pupusas are $1 each, down from $1.75 regularly. Occasionally we stock up on 10-15 and take em to go, so we end up with a few meals worth. The pupusas come with a salsa and a Salvadoran slaw called curtido. It's a mixture of pickled cabbage, onions, carrots and spices that when eaten with the pupusa tastes great. This is hands down my favorite Salvadoran restaurant in town."}
{"text":"We had the combinacion salvadoreña. The papusas were truly amazing but the rest was just okay. The red sauce had very little flavor and the meat was overcooked. A good sauce would have made it for me but instead it was just okay."}
{"text":"Love the pupusa specials here on Tuesday and Thursdays for the mixed pupusas! It's located in a shady area, but the food is so good!"}
{"text":"Pupusas?? As a hardcore Mexican food enthusiast I was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced.  I am proud to say that I am a HUGE fan of pupusas now.  

Salvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice Sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food.  It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa.

The restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time I'll just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.)

The only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  I'd love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a \"Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!\"

On a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.  I'd love to try the Ceviche, as it's on the Best of Phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing."}
{"text":"Buen sabor ;) lo que esperaba probar de unas ricas pupusas , los frijolitos negros refritos , gracias , el trato fue súper  amable , segunda ves que pruebo la comida salvadoreña , espero volver pronto..."}
{"text":"Just because I gave this place a 3 doesn't mean I wouldn't come here again. Here is why I gave this place a 3:

Environment: You walk in and you may be greeted or perhaps ignored. If you are dinning in, take and sit. If you're ordering to go, go to the cashier booth. Very small and dark. Nice pictures on the wall but wouldn't sit next to them because they're filthy dirty. The tables are just like I described..DIRTY. I asked the lady to clean our table and she did with an attitude.Floor, just keep your head leveled. -1 star

Waitress: She was absolutely RUDE. She did not introduce herself and she asked what we wanted right away with an attitude instead of letting us know the specials. Drinks take about 5 full minutes to arrive. (There is only one waitress by the way). She Took our order and 10 minutes later she brought us our utensils and condiments. 

Food: AMAZING!!!!! One thing, it takes 35-45 minutes for the food to come out. But when it comes out, its nice and hot! The food tasted delicious and perfect. I ordered pupusas revueltas and the sauce was great as well with the cabbage that goes on top. I cant honestly complain about the food. +3

Overall: It was a lesson learned. Don't come here if you are starving because you will pass out (takes a long time for the food to come out). The food is great. Everything else they can change but wont stop me from coming in again if i'm in the mood for pupusas."}
{"text":"YES! 

Thank you Salvadoreno for making my pupusa loving dreams come true! I just moved back to the valley after 6yrs away, having discovered and fallen in love with El Salvadorian food in the mean while. I was worried that I wouldn't find a good spot here as we some times lack in fine ethnic cuisine that isn't Mexican. 

I was tickled pink last night to discover Salvadoreno in an unassuming strip mall in Mesa (they have 2 other locations around the valley). The food was blissfully authentic as was the price. They even suggested a deal on the menu for 20 pupusas for $30. I might add this place to my bi-weekly grocery shopping list. I can't say enough about how happy I was to get real El Salvadorian food that hadn't been taken over by the flavors of Mexico, U.S. or Arizona. 

One of the family members who runs the joints was even there and everyone who worked there was quite friendly. I'm happy to support these guys. 

I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover on this one - great pupusas and huge portions! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We made a recent visit to this place. Being Salvadorean myself, figured I'd better give it shot. The food was okay, not great. I've had papusas all my life and I've been to a few great Salvadorean restaurants on the West Side but this Mesa place was not all that. The service was very slow, we ordered two horchatas to start and it took a while to get them. Then we ordered papusas and there was hardly any cheese in my cheese and meat papusa. And to top it all off, when I asked about the check-in offer from Yelp the girl had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. :/"}
{"text":"This place is the best for pupusas!
Your crazy if you don't eat them here.  Never mind the location, inside  is whole different look!!.All other places don't even come close.  Real beans not canned.  All food made fresh to order yum! yum!.

You want awesome service? ask for sandra!!  Don't hesitate  get here  Tuesday thru Sunday  closed on mondays.

Make sure you get the passion fruit drink.... see you there"}
{"text":"A very good spot to eat salvi food. We went to Amanecer first. But thats another deal. Come here instead Very well priced and good food. Will definately come back."}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying that I have spent the last three years living in Los Angeles, spending  a lot of time particularly near MacArthur Park and my lovely girlfriend was born and raised in Santa Ana, El Salvador. This review is based on my experiences with numerous restaurantes salvadoreños and not to mention her home cooked pupusas. 

I first tried this place after being let down a few times here in Las Vegas. My friend and I went here mostly because it was filmed in Casino. Some of you might remember the scene where Rosenthal had Geri's ex boyfriend/sancho beat up in his Cadillac. We weren't expecting a whole lot. As I explained to him, Salvadoran food just isn't as good here as it was in LA. I don't know why but if any place is going to be good, this was it. We started off our order with two Pilseners (a nice touch since Salvadoran Beer is so hard to find and even harder in Las Vegas) and contemplated the kolashampan. We decided to stick to the cervezas but would later order a bottle to go, since they did have the legit Kolashampan from El Salvador.

After a little wait, the waitress served our pupusas revueltas and I was in heaven! It took me right back to MacArthur Park! This is as real as you'd get anywhere in Los Angeles. I highly recommend this place and can't praise it enough. 

We ended up capping the trip off with a nice plate of platanos fritos con frijoles y crema and we split a Cerveza Regia and we bought some pupusas to go, the Kolashampan and some car banners, so yes, I am the tall white guy in the black Chevy with a Salvadoran flag hanging from my turn signal now. Lol

Wondering if this was some king of freak accident, I took my grandma here today and we had the same great food, same cold beer and same wonderful service. This place gets an A+ in my book"}
{"text":"The pupusas  revueltas (pork chicharon, cheese, and beans) and a huevos rancheros were really good for breakfast. Prices were very reasonable and the service was fast."}
{"text":"The pupusas were great.  The plantain was not really plantain but was a banana, too sweet and too greasy.  The tamales had a soft mushy outside, unusual but good. Staff were friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Papusas!  This is one of the few places that I actually have cravings for.  You can't go wrong with any of the papusa flavors (carne asada is my favorite followed by loroco flower) and the fried plantains are an excellent treat.  Eat the papusas topped with the curtido (coleslaw) and salsa, it really pushes the flavor over the top."}
{"text":"after writing this review I was contacted by mangt w/a very nice letter apolgizing for the mis communication  between the server and us  and explaining the dishes we ordered ..my mis conseption of the beef dish w/eggs my wife had. Any business that takes this kind of action to make sure it's patrons are satisified deserves 5 stars!!!!!!!!! WE WILL BE BACK       THANKS"}
{"text":"Came here specifically because of the fantastic reviews here on Yelp. Unfortunately I learned that great reviews don't necessarily translate into great food. After making my way through the terrible construction on Mesa Drive, I pulled up to this true hole-in-the-wall place for lunch with my dad. Seeing nothing but Spanish on the storefront, I wasn't even sure if the employees would speak English. Fortunately my meal was made easier by the fact that the waitress did, in fact, know my language. 

I started off with the Tamarindo drink, which had a similar artificially sweet flavor to Thai iced tea. I wasn't a big fan. I then ordered one cheese and one chicken pupusa. I didn't find either particularly tasty, and the food was very heavy. It kind of sits in your stomach after you eat it. 

Overall, the service was fine and the divey atmosphere didn't really bother me, but the mediocre food means I can't give the place more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great papusas!! The server was sweet and the papusas and platanos were incredible. Location wasn't great, but everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get my pupusas fix. I got the combo of 3 pupusas with rice and beans for $7.95. They had about 10 different pupusas to choose from. I chose: revuelta (cheese, beans & chicharron), steak and cheese and a pork and cheese. I ordered mines to go, and it took a while. Definitely not a place if you're in hurry. I had to wait at least 15 minutes but that's understandable, pupusas usually takes a while to cook. 

The pupusas were pretty large. Honestly I made 3 seperate meals out of this one combo. They are served with salvadorean slaw and curtido (a red salsa). The slaw here is fresh and crunchy. It's tasty and great with the pupusas. It also had a distinct oregano flavor that I haven't tasted in other slaws. My favorite of the 3 was the revuelta. The three ingredient filling worked really well together. The sides were good, as well. The rice was nice and fluffy and the beans were pretty awesome. It was a little thinner in consistency than normal refried beans but the flavor was pretty damn good. Maybe thats what made the revuelta pupusa my favorite of the 3, the awesome beans they use.

This restaurant would probably rank 3 stars on my pupusas radar but giving the limited el salvadorean restaurants in Phx, it makes it 4 stars.

*If you never had a pupusas I'd probably describe it as a stuffed sope that's crisp up on both sides like a quesadilla."}
{"text":"Best pupusas ever!  Also love the plantains.  We eat here every time we are in the area.  It isn't fancy but one of the best surprises you will come across!"}
{"text":"Pupusas were ok, nothing out of this world though. The service, however, was horrible. I had to stand up and get the waitress' attention several times. My husband ordered a shrimp dish that was over priced and tasteless. When we went to pay they had charged us this $13 dish twice! 
In regards to the aesthetics, the building was old and the chairs were wobbly. 
WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING."}
{"text":"Found a hair in my food. When I brought it to the staff's attention they simply looked at me, smiled and said it was my own hair. Even though the hair was tangled in the pupusa"}
{"text":"Horrible costumer service. Walk up to the counter and stood there for a bit, then finally a lady asks me to have a seat and someone will be with me...waited ..and then another group of guys come in sit down on the table next to us and finally a lady comes to help BUT completely ignores my family and helps the group of guys.. and thats when we walk out. No need to spend my money on a place like that."}
{"text":"Pupusa trio is very filling. The carne asada was extra but the most flavorful of the bunch. The loroco flower tasted of pollen but the curtido and salsa eclipsed the flavor, but you can never have enough of those two things on any pupusa. The fried yucca was plain but the pork included was very tasty. The fried plantain was the best I've ever had, the cream gives an initial tart but then follows it with a carameled sweet that astounds the taste buds."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for years and I've always had great customer service and amazing food. The pupusas are always spot on. Definitely one of my top 5 restaurants we frequent!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with their El Salvadorean sampler and pupusa combo. Had their chicken and carne asada pupusas, rice and beans, tamale, yuca, empanada, and plantain chips. Their slaw and red sauce especially delicious."}
{"text":"This is the original salvadorean restaurant, they have been around since 1989 and as far as i am concerned they are the best pupusas around.  Ive been to these other so called salvadorean restaurants and their pupusas dont even compare. If you want the best pupusas in town, go to Salvadoreno Restaurant."}
{"text":"Good stuff!!! We had a large lunch group (we like to try a new type of food every month) and I think everyone loved it! Mostly papusas. I got the three with jalapenos, one cheese, one carne asada and one pork. They were all great! I got the crema (like sour cream) and beans (like bean juice?) for my sides. I will be back -- so glad we gave Salvadoreno a try!"}
{"text":"Great ceviche, friendly staff, and good service.  The only downside is the continuous construction on Mesa Drive makes getting in and out of the plaza a pain, otherwise I'd visit more."}
{"text":"Good Pupusas and the platanos maduros are really tasty. I took my coworkers for the first time and they enjoyed it. Ask for the queso with loroco. This makes the Pupusas taste better. The curtido was good too. I will come back to try out the tamales as they looked good. Support ethnic food!"}
{"text":"Pupusas were decent but i had better. This little establishment is tucked in by a ran down motel.  My buddy thought he was going to get shot and didnt want to eat anything. I was hungy so i tried it out. Its more of a local spot from the vibe i get."}
{"text":"Eh.  Just eh.  The papusas are decent.  The chips and salsa have to have been store bought....and who the hell puts a \"cell phone store\" inside of a restaurant?  Hello, ghetto!"}
{"text":"Wow great pupusa some of the best I have had..I will say I was worried do to the part of town . it's not a very nice place ,but clean. people were nice and spoke good English. Prices we good also. A great take home meal for family and friends.a meal everyone will love"}
{"text":"Based on good reviews,  I tried this place today with two little ones in tow.  I ordered nachos for them and I ordered 2 pupusas.  The\"nachos\" were chips with beans on top and a melted processed cheese poured over the top and some canned, pickled jalapeños and runny sour cream and imitation guacamole. Even the kids didn't want to eat it. The pupusas were ok...the picked cabbage was bland. If you're used to authentic Salvadoran food or good mexican food,  you will be very disappointed.  I won't go back,  that's for sure."}
{"text":"It was blind luck that I stumbled across ceviche over 10 years ago as a young lad living in Los Mochis, Sinaloa.  Since then it has become a signature dish in my heart and I've gone out of my to find restaurants whose reputations are tied to this savory dish from the sea.  
I was excited when I recently read a piece in Phoenix Magazine lauding the ceviche of Salvadoreno as one of the essential dishes of the valley.  I soon headed east to determine whether or not this dish would rival my favorite versions of the dish; the beach side shack outside of Topolobompo and the Halibut Ceviche of the Foundry Grill up at Sundance in Utah.
We were greeted by the friendly yet chaotic smile that it so common with Latin American dives.  We quickly ordered some horchata, very strong, and some pupusas, above average, before we prepared to dine the reason for our visit.
I certainly wasn't disappointed.  My only real hang up was their interpretation of what a portion should be.  The dish could serve 4 people without a problem.  The ingredients were standard to ceviche and all tasted very fresh.  The only slight difference was that the shrimp on top were grilled.  
We finished the meal with Nuegados de Yuca con miel, fried but not too heavy, and called it a meal.  While it wasn't the best ceviche it was certainly among the top tier.  The restaurant is just close enough to warrant a semi regular visit.  A great place that deserves your attention.  Just remember that when you order the ceviche bring a friend or three along for the ride."}
{"text":"Visited from Chicago and was pleasantly surprised with the pupusas. I didnt expect the \"mexican\" versions of a traditional pupusa but I expect that is due to the area or customers requests. Decor is basic tables with a tv playing in the background. Good food , Nice staff and feels traditional. Dont forget to buy a bumper sticker!"}
{"text":"Chicken was undercooked when we received it, and then came back overcooked when we asked them to touch it up. 

The pupusas were claimed to be their specialty, but were mostly cheese. 

The black bean rice and bean dip both were really good.

Decor and ambiance are minimal.  Service was slow.  But they did seem to have a steady stream of customers.  Not busy, but not empty either.

I doubt we will return here."}
{"text":"Love the food here and very cheap. The only minus is that the restaurant is in a bad area but beside that the food is very good"}
{"text":"Great Salvadorian food! Good portion. I was able to have leftover too. The service was nice and prices were good. Recommended."}
{"text":"Chicken and cheese pupusas and fried plantains  delicious. Everything is made to order so either order a head of time or be prepared to wait. The customer service is a bit sketchy but the food more than makes up for it. 
The masa is seasoned as well as the chicken filling. The portions are a nice size. The cole slaw is a bit spicy and may not be suitable for toddlers. This place will be our go to place for pupusas."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since I was a little kid! I've tried other pupusas in town but I think none compare to this place! Pupusas are made to order so it does take a while for them to come out..be patient! The revueltas are my favorite! Cheese, beans and chicharron! El curtido makes the perfect topping with the tomato sauce! The customer service is always great! Only bad thing I can say is the location. It's been around for a long time, so I'm sure that has something to do with it. Close to downtown but the older side of Vegas."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night. It really wasn't very busy. There were maybe three other tables. We sat down and ordered. It took 45 minutes to get our food, and the waitress didn't come back to refill our drinks at any point during our wait. At this point we were very hungry, and anything would have tasted good. We get our food and the pupusas taste like they've been sitting out for a long time and are lukewarm. My main entree was soupy. The beans were soupy. Everything was soupy. The worst part was nothing was seasoned, and it all tasted bland. The entree was supposed to come with rice but apparently they ran out so there options were more soupy beans or a chunk of cold cheese. It wasn't a good experience and not that cheap."}
{"text":"This is a good hole in the wall place. If you feel like some home cooking, try this out. The Papuas are fantastic."}
{"text":"I've never had a pupusa before, but it was an awesome thing to eat. A meat filled pancake? Yes, thank you! Well worth the fiasco of getting into the plaza with all the construction on Mesa Dr."}
{"text":"My first pupusa experience was a hit! Had never tried El Salvador food, and wanted to try something new so my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out, and I am glad we did.

The restaurant is very tiny, hole in the wall type place. Posters of El Salvador on the walls..making me want to travel there! Our server was nice, did not speak much English, but that was not really a problem. I am not sure if we misunderstood and we were supposed to go up to the front and order, because we would ask her a question about an item, she'd answer, then run off before we could order!

The food was yummy! I got the squash and cheese and the bean and cheese pupusa and they were both awesome. The squash and cheese had a bit more cheese than I would have liked, as I do not eat cheese often, but still was appetizing. It also came with beans and rice on the side. I wasn't used to eating liquefied beans, but I did enjoy them.

For dessert my boyfriend and I shared the nuegados de yuca con miel. It was a little odd for my taste, but obviously something I have never had before. If I go again I would want to give a different dessert a try.

OH and when you visit their website, you can find a coupon for 10% off your first visit. Though the food is pretty inexpensive, not that big of a deal if you forget the coupon like I did haha."}
{"text":"Best pupusa and the Salvadorean combo plate is amazing. Prices are fair but they did go up. Little taste of El Salvador in Mesa."}
{"text":"We were immediately greeted when we walked in the restaurant. In no time at all the waitress took our drink orders. She helped us make our menu selections. She also described some of the menu items that we were unfamiliar with. The food was delicious and prepared & served promptly. This was a good experience. We will return. Sure wish I knew the waitress's name. She was very friendly."}
{"text":"It's food is so good and makes it worth coming back for more. I highly recommend the queso pupusas and the pollo tamales. This are my absolute fave! 

Only downside service is slow and the staff seems like they don't want to be here."}
{"text":"Pupusas are good the customer service is horrible!! The waitress never asked us what we wanted to drink. We finally did ask her and come to find out 10 minutes later that they were out of what we wanted.  Our food arrived and it still took them another 10 minutes to get our drinks!  She brought the wrong order and did not apologize.  We had to get our own silverware, shall I go on?  I would try their other chain on Southern."}
{"text":"3 stars because I've loved their food for years since I moved to this state. The missing two stars is from my friend I getting food poisoning from them the other day. Still recovering, thankfully it wasn't that bad. :("}
{"text":"Really good pupusas. The carne asada was my favorite. We also tried the sampler platter. It was nice to try a variety I things. I would really recommend this place."}
{"text":"My son and I wanted to try something new so we picked this place. We ordered several dishes to try and were very pleased with what we are.  
The food was flavorful and enjoyed everything, except the service, it was terrible, but we didn't care, the food made up for it."}
{"text":"OMG! This place is amazing!! My husband felt bad for bringing me here because its not in the best area. I said \"who cares \" the food here is AMAZING and would recommend this place to anyone who is out here in Vegas looking for authentic Salvadorian food."}
{"text":"We were looking for a different place to try for dinner. We love trying different varieties of ethnic foods. My husband saw this place and checked the reviews. We saw the overall consensus was positive and that people raved about their food. 

I have to say I was not impressed at all. We sat down and the server came over, asked us if we spoke Spanish, which we don't. It felt like she was offended that we didn't speak Spanish and from that moment on I didn't feel welcome, she was very rude and reluctant to help me navigate the menu. I ordered the 2 Papusa meal with one steak/cheese and the other chicken/cheese. I used the sauce that came with it, but they just had no taste. They were so bland. Maybe I just don't have the pallet for food like this, even though I love Mexican cuisine. 

Between the incredibly rude server and the pretty much tasteless food, I can say for sure I won't be back."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and this place seemed like it could have potential. The food is homemade and the workers are nice. I ordered three pupusas: Loroco con queso, black beans and cheese and one with chicharron. They were good, but the didn't have as much in the middle as I am used to. Overall it was good, but I have had many much better pupusas."}
{"text":"Took my friends here to introduce them to the wonders of pupusas. Service during weekday lunch was friendly and quick. The food was great, including the chips and salsa (chips were kind of thick and chewy but still crunchy)."}
{"text":"I went here based off reviews. But Sunday during brunch may not have been the most ideal time. The place was hot and muggy. The food was edible, but not to my standards of the good salvadorean food I am use to in Seattle. Beans were runny. Pupusas super greasy. Pork over fried. Not the best quality.  Service was polite yet minimal. Will stick to my Salvadorean place back in West Seattle."}
{"text":"Food is ok, however, the customer service was the worse I ever had. We had to get our own menus and they took forever to get our food. Poor customer service, poor infrastructure, high prices. That was the first and last time for that place."}
{"text":"This place could be called a dive, but it's clean and cheerful inside. Tried pupusas (pork and cheese) for the first time and thought they were on the bland side but still enjoyable (the weak red salsa didn't add much). But the beans were excellent, smooth and soupy, just a touch too salty, but not in a bad way. I ended up dipping the pupusas in the beans and thought they were both perfect that way (next time I will order bean pupusas). The little salad of slightly pickled cabbage was fresh and good, reminded me of kimchi without the heat. I will definitely go back and try other things."}
{"text":"This is pupusa heaven. If you have never had a pupusa it is like a flatten tamale that is lightly fried. It's a beautiful art to make them, I know as I've tried. The Salvador Restaurant is a nice family owned restaurant. Call ahead and take out or dine in is good too. One of my top ten foods to eat. If you never had one come in and try it, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices.  They have a BOGO coupon in the Entertainment book.  The food was good - nothing fancy.  The eggs in the Huevos Rancheros were cooked hard other than that everything was good.  The thick tortilla things (not sure what they're called) were good although I think they would be better with some honey or butter at least.  The beans and rice was good.  Service was pretty slow, but friendly.  I wouldn't go there in a hurry."}
{"text":"VERY friendly wait staff and consistently incredible food. Visit this place as soon as you can! I'm generally very conservative with my ratings ...this place definitely deserves the 5 stars I rated it."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Salvadorean food restaurant now. Was in the mood for Pupusas and decided to try this place based on trusty Yelp! We picked up to go which was really nice that it wasn't that far away from where we live they were quick with our order. We ordered three pupusa meal that comes with three Pupusas of your choice and two side orders and we ordered an extra one on the side just to round out the meal for two

The flavor was definitely there the size of them was great I would have liked a larger side but no biggie

We will definitely order but will make sure all our food is included. 

Only negative: they forgot our rice in our to go order which sucked because we didn't get it and we paid for it and didn't realize till we were home as some sides are placed inside to go box and others are not"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was excited about trying this place. I absolutely love pupusa's & couldn't wait to get one. We drove 30 minutes to have dinner & was pretty disappointed. The pupusa's tasted just like a quesadilla & the \"steak\" that was suposed to be in consisted of 5 tiny pieces. The beans were watery & tasteless but the rice was delicious & the staff was friendly which is why I gave 2 stars."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall has one tiny but powerfully delicious kitchen that brings out the best Pupusas I have ever tasted in my life..  the food is hot, freshly cooked and packed with so much flavor, the prices are so low that I feel if they raised the prices slightly and kept the same amazing customer service and fantastic kitchen work they could easily get a well deserved bigger and more contemporary place.  Regardless of the size, this place is wonderful, it's clean and the staff is so friendly and the food .. I just can't stop saying how delicious the food here is.      If you want to impress someone with a non pretentious hole in the wall wonder then this is the delicious place to introduce someone to their first most amazing Pupusa!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant with a groupon. Probably would not have, if I didn't have the coupon. Don't let the storefront and decor stop you from going in. The restaurant is super clean and the wait staff is very friendly. And the food, WOW!  We split the Shrimp Ceviche and the combination pupusa plate. The portions were very generous. I ordered the fruit drink. Everything was absolutely delicious. One of my new favorite restaurants . Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant when performing a Yelp search for Ceviche in Mesa the other day.

I was a little skeptical due to some of the low ratings, but we decided to enter the humble looking venue, in the primitive looking strip mall.

We were immediately greeted and seated by a lovely hostess / server. She was extremely attentive and informative, as we were not familiar with Pupusas or much of the other Salvadorian Cuisine.

We ordered and shared the Shrimp Ceviche, which was garnished with fresh Avocado and Cucumbers. The freshly fried tortilla chips were very tasty, and the ceviche was a little more on the sweet side vs. the typical intense lime flavor. It was very fresh tasting, and we both really enjoyed it.

We were given a lesson in what Pupusas are, and asked our lovely waitress to pick three of her favorite choices and send them out. She chose Carne Asada, Chicharon with beans, and the last one was not quite identified, but was very tasty.

Before bringing out the Pupusas, she dropped off a small bowl of a red sauce, and a bowl of spicy cabbage, which were meant to be used as toppings for the Pupusas.

We both thought that the Pupusas were very simple, yet tasty. The spicy cabbage and red sauce as toppings really added flavor to the Pupusas.

We were impressed with what we perceived to be authentic Salvadorian Cuisine, so we ordered one last dish. 

We had to try the fried Plantains, served with a black bean sauce, and Crema. The plantains were fried to perfection with nice caramelization. The black bean sauce was interesting, and the cream was a little on the salty side, rather than sweet as I would have expected. It is small details such as these which led us to believe that the food was authentic.

Don't let the other reviews mislead you if you are looking for a fresh, authentic experience. 

If you want a fancy location with beer and wine, then forget about it. This place is all about giving an authentic, down to earth, culinary experience to those who seek quality without the distraction of interior design.  :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Had some bean with cheese, revueltas and chicharron pupusas. The salad drink wasn't the best but hey I finished it AALL! Will def b coming back"}
{"text":"I have never tried Salvadorean food until I came here.  And after trying it, I will definitely come back for more.  The servers are welcoming and make you feel like you're right at home.  They start you off with chips and salsa, and the salsa is very addicting!  You'll be asking for more. 

The servings are very large for the price you pay.  My favorite thing to get is pupusas.  It will be one of the most amazing things you've ever eaten.  It is like a pancake stuffed with cheese, beans, and/or meat, served with this cabbage cole slaw type condiment and salsa in a bottle.  (I personally just use the salsa they use for the chips, its thicker and tastier).  And for less than $2, I'll take two please!  I've gone to different pupuserias and I have not had any that can match theirs."}

Yet another incredible restaurant review...(drum roll please) Restaurant Salvadoreno on Main between Bonanza and Main (720 N. Main 702-385-3600). This local gem belongs to the family of one of my 7th grade boys. During my visit his father carefully explained the menu, trying to relate their offerings to familar American fair. I chose pupas (filed corn pancakes), platanos, and fried yuca. He also suggested the empanadas (chicken pies)...amazing. One word...yummy, even my picky South American hubby was digging into the to go boxes before I could plate our dinners. They have both eat in and to go dinning options.  Go and eat local @ Restaurant Salvadoreno!!!!!!"}

Having never eaten Salvadoran food before, I decided to try it, and am so glad that I did. This is totally different than Mexican food.

This is a relatively small restaurant, with a tiny kitchen, but don't let the size fool you - that tiny kitchen turns out some wonderful food. I noticed that I was the only gringa in the place - a good sign that the food is muy authenitico.

The waitress brought my drink along with a nice, crisp cole slaw type salad with some greens in it that I was not able to identify, but which gave it a nice flavor. Service is a little slow, but I attribute that to the fact that every dish is cooked to order - no steam tables here.

Next, was the main course. I ordered the Lengua Guisada ($9.95). Nice, big slices of tongue braised in a wonderful mild tomato type sauce, served with rice that had veggies in it, and small dish of liquified black beans along with two of the most succulent corn tortillas I have ever eaten. Instead of being crisp and crunchy, these were firm on the outside, and soft and tender on the inside. For the more adventurous, there is also hot sauce on the table. The flavors were all wonderful, and I used the corn tortillas to mop up all of the sauce on the plate. I would be lax if I didn't mention the fact the that food was served steaming hot.

I had to try the Pupupas, which are stuffed corn tortillas which are then grilled. I tried two different ones, and although I was entitled to get rice and bean with them, I opted not to have them because I was already getting full. The first Pupupas was stuffed with shrimp and cheese, and had a lovely texture and flavor. They have a tomato based sauce on the table that you can slather on your Pupupas if you so desire. I found that it really augmented the flavor and ended up using it on both Pupupas. The second Pupupas was shredded pork and cheese, and while tasty, wasn't up to the flavor profile of the camerones.

Unfortunately, by this time I was stuffed and had no more room to try anything else, but I will be back to try some more. Next time I want to try the Sopa de Pata/Mondongo, which is a hearty soup of heart and beef tripe, along with the Ensalada de Camarones Asados, which is a grilled shrimp salad.

It's hard to leave here hungry - you really would have to work at it!

Sanitation was good and the place is handicapped aware. They also will modify menu items to make them vegetarian.

I give them 4 stars for a really tasty meal that was muy authentico."}
{"text":"La comida buena pero la atención muy mala la actitud de sus meseras terrible, necesitan algún buen entrenamiento de atención al cliente antes de ponerlas a trabajar."}
{"text":"When so many restaurants here are closed on Sundays, it was great to find a good one that was open. And not just good - we had an absolutely marvelous meal here. Tasty bean pupusas made with rice flour (instead of wheat), scrumptious and moist chicken tamales, and delicious fried plantains for dessert. (We did not get the sweet plantains & cream but the 'dinner' ones with pureed black beans, and I found those sweet enough by themselves.)

The staff was quite friendly to us, and it didn't hurt that my companion could hold her own conversing in Spanish with them. Yet the food by itself was so enjoyable, my stomach was grinning the whole way home. ¡Ricissimo!"}
{"text":"My family loves to come here. At least 2-3 times per month we come for the pupusas. There is  a combo plate that has 3 pupusas, rice, and beans for about $10, but typically I order two a la carte (just over $2 each). We usually get the chicharones, but the most recent time I ordered one chicken and one spinach. The pineapple aqua fresca is excellent as well. If you are looking for El Salvadorian food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Be sure to try the Carne Asada Pupusas. We had a great time. Went with a big group and the food and service were great."}
{"text":"This is the first time visiting this restaurant. The pupusas were very good. I have never had this style of food before. The service was very good and friendly."}
{"text":"I would love to just say one word for my review \"PUPUSAS!!\" but that would serve no justice which is deserved for this amazing food establishment. We love pupusas, and have been enjoying this filled pocketed tortilla of greatness for a long time. After trying from many, this is one of the best. Their revuleta pupusa and camarones are two of the best. Their curtido is stupido good and their sauce is perfect. I actually went off the norm and ordered a grilled camarones ensalada. Seriously good. The shrimps were grilled nicely, the salad was a combination of fresh green lettuce, black beans, corn and pico with chopped jalapenos. All was excellent. The dressing it came was interesting. Really good, super smokey and had little kick to it. Always enjoy their food. Language is typically a barrier when I order food for us from here so heads up, know some or be nice and patient. One of our favorite places to order from. Everything is made to order so be patient with that too :)"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for lunch.  I always get the Papusas, cheese and beans and rice.  The food is all made to order so it may take a little bit of time... but totally worth the wait.  I would recommend this place and I will be back."}
{"text":"Discovered this little hole in the wall while pinging my Yelp Blackberry app looking for adventure (and lunch).  It is close the the Southeast Annex of the Maricopa County Superior Court.  If you are interested in some good ceviche, this is a great place to go.

The ambiance is definitely humble.  The restaurant is situated in the corner of a strip mall containing a dollar store, a rent to own place, and a pawn shop.  Upon walking into the restaurant, I immediately noticed it was clean, and that there was no overpowering smell of seafood; both were good signs.  I was confused as to whether I should order at the counter, or sit down at a table.  (Silly gringo.)   If you are dining in, sit down at a table and they will bring you a menu.  

The Diet Coke I ordered was brought to my table in a can with a glass of ice.  It appears that they have Mexican (cane sugar) Coke in glass bottles for those of you so inclined.

The menu had quite a few seafood choices.  There were also other items on the menu that i was not familiar with.  Salvadoran food is similiar to, but different from Mexican food.  Note that the pictures of the food on the menu do not do the actual food justice.

I ordered the ceviche and after a 10 to 15 minute wait, I was brought a very large plate piled with ceviche on top of lettuce ringed with tomato, cucumber, and avocado, and topped with grilled (hot) shrimp.  I was also brought a small bowl of chips.  This was a little different than the way I have had ceviche served in Mexican restaurants.  I am not sure if this is Salvadoran, or just this restaurant's unique take on ceviche.  I picked the grilled shrimp off the top with my fingers, squeezing off the tails.  I then dug into the ceviche with the chips unti I ran out of chips.  With the chips gone, I picked up my fork and finished the dish including the lettuce.

Everything, seafood and veggies,  was fresh and tasty.    The serving was extremely generous.  I left with a very happy panzita.

I will definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I order the chicken pupusa with a cold tamarind drink. The restaurant is clean and the staff are courteous. I've ordered twice and I would recommend to anyone wanting to try a different Latino dish. Yum."}
{"text":"Loved it!! came back twice... authentic pupusas, I'm only reviewing pupusas, i have not tried other dishes.
P.S. I'm Salvadorean so I think I'm  critic..."}
{"text":"Pupusas! I love me some pupusas! 
That's all that I have ordered from there so I can't comment on the rest of the food.
They are delicious, they are made to order, or so it seems because it takes a while to get the food. I order the cheese and the chicharron with cheese, they are big enough that 2 fill me up.

Why only 3 stars then?
They are inefficient when it comes to customer service and overall cleanliness of the place. Every time I visit there is a few dirty tables that remain dirty while I wait for my food to be served, and there is rarely more than a few customers at the same time, at least during the dinner times I have been there, their server's could not be any more unfriendly, as if you're disturbing their time by eating there. Sometimes there is a smell to the place that makes me question my decision to eat there. They have a rule of 1 dollar charge if you don't spend more than 20 dollars and pay with a credit card."}
{"text":"I'm usually very happy with the food we order here. Idk if they have new people working or what but usually when I order the 20 carne asada pupusas they're loaded with meat. Today I received an order of 20 with barely any meat at all. I counted maybe 3-4 tiny pieces of meat in the pupusa so I pretty much paid for breading!"}
{"text":"Takes 30 minutes for an order.... I recommend calling ahead or perhaps asking for the day off at work to just sit and wait for your food ..."}
{"text":"This place has the best pupusas I've had in Vegas. Super friendly and intimate. Lunch was less than ten bucks. Don't eat fast food!"}
{"text":"Like the other poster, we found this place via a Yelp \"Nearby\" search and were very pleasantly surprised.  

This particular branch of this restaurant is tucked into the corner of a mostly deserted shopping center in a rundown part of Mesa and doesn't look like much from outside.  

Inside is a different story.  The restaurant is fairly humble but immaculately clean and bright with a pleasant enough ambiance and the service was friendly and quick.  

We had  a ceviche salad ($12.95) and a pupusa combination plate ($7.95).  Both were quite delicious and portions were huge.

If you aren't familiar with Salvadorean food, I'd recommend you start with the pupusa with loroco (an edible flower), which is the classic pupusa and extremely delicious."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love to eat breakfast here. The pupusas are delicious(jst like grandmas). And their scrambled eggs with plantains, beans and sour cream is ridiculously good. The wait can sometimes be long."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and amazing...the chicken papusas are the best!!! location is terrifying but the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Este lugar fue el primer restaurante salvadoreño en las Vegas, las pupusas es mi favorito aquí especialmente las revueltas, el chicharrón tiene un sabor especial que no se encuentra en todos lados, el servicio es bueno, gente amable y amigable"}
{"text":"When I'm craving pupusas, this is the place I go to! It's not close to my home but it's worth the drive. The pupusas are just the right size and they aren't stingy with the filling. I usually get the mixed pupusas. Decent prices for delicious food. Located near down town."}
{"text":"Best pupusas in Phoenix!  Friendly service and yummy food!  Not too many with that combo period so this plaza is win win!"}
{"text":"First time coming here or ever hearing about this place, however i think this place should be more popular! 

I had the pork and cheese pupusa and it was awesome. I put the vinegar coleslaw on top and it only got better! 

The atmosphere is like you would get stepping into an authentic restaurant in El Salvador. Great job. 

I will be back and bringing friends. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Que mal! Llame para ser mi orden de popusas y la mujer que contesto se escucho sin ganas de trabajar que mientras hablando bostezando contestando me bien mal. Veo los demás comentarios que se han quejado. Peor si es restaurante en familia. Al final cancele la orden."}
{"text":"On this location is a bit better service than on Gilbert Mesa AZ. The popusas are very good and the fried Yuka. I didn't give all stars in fact changed my rating because of there other location. Mesa AZ has bad reviews of rude waitress and assistance and yet nothing has been done. Check my review on the location. Moving forward I am going somewhere else for my popusas."}
{"text":"Went to restaurant at 8 pm and was refused service (except take out only) with my family.  Just enjoyed 2 hours at \"feed my children\" non profit organization helping pack food for the less fortunate in the Philippines and due to me being white and wife and kids from Mexico we were laughed at and mocked from employee at this restaurant.  My wife has visited here on previous occasions with fellow employees ( Spanish decent) and treated excellent.  
As a family at exactly 8:10 pm told close at 9 and told we couldn't eat there.  Left the restaurant and watch another enter and were served promptly.  Seated with place sittings and the normal sauces offered to customers.  
Pretty tough teaching your kids to help kids of other countries yet refused service 10 minutes later because we are multi racial in our home.  We love Spanish food and were really excited to eat here. 
As long as you fit their preferred ethnic preference you should enjoy your meal.  Might reconsider if your multi cultured like us...... Wow, never experienced this before.....

App forces me to give at-least one star.  Do they really deserve it?????  Decide yourself....  I'm not prejudice obviously.  I love my wife and the only difference is she has beautiful brown skin and I'm white wishing I had her beautiful skin.  She's from Sinaloa, Mexico."}
{"text":"Very disappointed... had a coupon they would not honor it ... had trouble finding the restaurant called the number on the coupon was provided the location ....and then they would not honor the coupon ... when we asked to speak with a manager they played  back and forth with the phones wasting our time ... they also were super sketchy when we asked the managers name and we were provided 3 names ... we left feeling bait & switched and to be honest the food was not great either 
My advice is DO NOT GO HERE EVER!"}
{"text":"This place is really good! All around, good. Overlooking that it's a very old old restaurant, but that tells you something though! It's remained very good throughout the bad economy period without closing...Their Pupusas are delicious and quite large, I have to say. One would be enough actually. Their pollo Frito (fried chicken basket) is the bomb! Plus they're pollo encebollado, (smothered fried chicken with sautee'd onions) is a must try, served with their most delicious signature rice...their Atole de maiz is Delish..its a must try. Served very hot, it's a thick corn drink with bits of fresh corn, served in a cup. They do make the best I've ever tried. The vive is very Latino, but the waitresses do speak English and can help you with the menu gracefully. The food is totally aurhentic and true to El Salvador. The service is very curteous and professional. A must try.."}
{"text":"The pupusas were delicious and the staff was great at this Salvadoran restaurant.  I'll definitely be coming back.

Las pupusas ricas de este restaurante salvadoreño son preciosas. Los camareros y el servicio también está bien. Sin duda, regresaré pronto."}
{"text":"Yummy food. I went went with 8 other girls during lunch and the pupusas were very yummy. Everyone was satisfied, even the first timers who are known to be picky eaters. The only negative was that the server could not serve us fast enough."}
{"text":"I am a fan of most Latin cuisine, I was eager to try central american foods. When I moved here in 1997 I had seen this place on my way downtown thinking, wow looks kind of shady. About a year later, my husband said it would be worth it to at least try. I was glad he suggested it. We've been coming here for 10+ years now.
The current interior is more of a restaurant than the previous decor which was very eclectic, they had murals painted on the walls, lattice partitions, fishnet hammocks strung up giving it a very \"backyard of someones home\" feel. A few years ago, the motel attached decided to renovate the exterior, and the owners of Salvadoreno took the opportunity to update their interior, now its tables and chairs, brown tones.
The food has remained consistently delicious. Everything is fresh made. They have a variety of pupusas, filled corn tortilla pattys, from beans and cheese, loroco (native sprout), and the revuelta which is refried beans, cheese, and ground shredded pork (known as chicharron). The Plato Tipico is the Salvadoran typical plate, it combines a mix of the staples, a pice of grilled steak (carne asada), fried sweet plantain, a drier cheese similar to feta, a small lettuce tomato salad, and my favorite, casamiento, which is a rice and bean combo that is cooked together and is so tasty!
Also on the menu are pollo asado, taquitos, carne asada plate, steak encebollado (with onions), seafood cocktails (coctel mariscos) and fresh drinks (aguas frescas) such as horchata (a rice water drink, with the addition of ground pumpkin seeds, ensalada, a chopped fruit punch drink, and various drinks on roatation. A variety of latin beers are also offered.
Please check this place out, its in a bad hood, sure, but the cooking is like someones mom invited you over for dinner The staff is warm and friendly, and if you happen to be there on a night when a soccer game is on, it gets rowdy!"}
{"text":"When I asked for water without ice-cream (agua sin helado) the waitress was so nice she didn't even laugh her _ _ _ off. Now I say aqua sin hielo and she's just as sweet. The food is good, the prices fair, the clientele there for quality and authenticity."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I really liked the food...service was a bit slow but the food was freshly made.  While walking by the kitchen, I did notice raw chicken on the counter while they prepared food...not sure how long it has been sitting there.  I would have given this restaurant more stars except that they gave themselves an additional tip on top of what I already gave them...which was 20%.  Keep your receipt and check your credit card statement!"}
{"text":"No quede satisfecha con la comida, pedi sopa de gallina la sopa era de cubito y el pollo se sentia viejo de un dia anterior, pesimo servicio y poca higiene."}
{"text":"Great food good prices and good service I will definitely be going back the Pupusas where very good."}
{"text":"Pupusas with bacon are you serious this is one of my life's dreams I have to say this place was as authentic as they get place they also have a twist with adding bacon and carne asada to the mix you have to try this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I went here the other day, as I had a Deal Chicken for this place. I used to go to a really good Salvadorian restaurant in Seattle, and was excited to see there was one right near where I live now. So the BF and I got here at around 8 at night on a Sunday and it was actually pretty busy. This place is in a tiny strip mall that does not look like it gets much business, and I would have never seen it from the road, so it must be good to still be in business. So I ordered a pollo pupusa, a carne asada pupusa, and a polla tamale, and the BF ordered two bean and cheese pupusas and a carne asada pupusa and we split the pastelitos con papas y queso. Well, the pastelitos were pretty tasty, like fried mashed potatoes, and they came with a spicier cabbage slaw which I liked a lot better than the regular cabbage slaw for the pupusas. All of the pupusas were really good, my real problem was with the sauce. The red sauce that came with them was just kind of flavorless. The place I used to go to had some really good red and green sauces for the pupusas... it was kind of disappointing. Also, about 5 minutes after we got the pupusas, the waitress came by and said 'oh I forgot to tell you we don't have any tamales.' Well, that kind of sucks, why did it take til we were already in the middle of eating to tell us? Also, it screwed up the amount I was trying to spend (since I had 20$ to spend on the deal chicken) which I guess shows that this place is cheap, which is good, but for this particular trip that wasn't good. So we decided to order a dessert to replace the tamale. We got the empanadas de platano with sweet cream. So this was a big deal for the waitress, she had already totaled out the bill and for some reason it was a huge deal to add a dessert at the end (which I thought was weird, but felt guilty about giving her extra work). Anyway, the empanadas were ok, but I've had better. The sweet cream is in the middle of the plantain and it isn't all that sweet. Oh well, I would definitely come back here for some yummy pupusas and maybe try a different dessert next time, the central american quesadilla looked pretty tasty...."}
{"text":"I was up one night watching DDD on the food network and they were talking about a Salvadorian restaurant that served pupusas. I had never heard of them before but they looked so delicious that I searched to see if we had a Salvadorian restaurant in AZ. Yay!! We do!!

This restaurant is tucked far back in a rundown shopping center in a not so great part of town - don't let that scare you away. The restaurant is clean and the food is AWESOME!! I have gone 2 times and both times I was very pleased. The pork and cheese pupusas are great and so are the cheese ones. The green corn tamales are the best I have ever had - EVER! The horchata is different but good and their crema is fantastic. I can't say enough about this place - I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have never had worse service.  Never checked on me, did not refill my water.  Left me sitting though I was clearly done eating.  Perhaps you two bovine creatures should study customer service and restaurant etiquette.  The food was not even that good.  Stay far, far away from this place....."}
{"text":"Omg! The BEST puspusas!!! My hubby and I love them so much we are here three days in a row. Truly a hidden gem in Arizona."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have tried Salvadoran food.  I had chicken pupusos with curtido, refried beans, and queso fresco.  Curtido is like coke slaw with extra spices and jalepeños or some kind of pepper.  Pupusos are thick, corn tortillas stuffed with cheese and meat.  Everything was delicious and the waitstaff was very friendly.  The restaurant is clean but plain.  The prices are reasonable.  We could bring our kids to this restaurant."}
{"text":"These papusas are amazzzzzzing. Just moved to Las Vegas and had not had this type of food before, but I will be back again and again for the delicious food!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they first opened. Seems like every year the Pupusas get smaller and the price gets higher. But I still enjoy their food."}
{"text":"I love the flavor this restaurant brings to our community! All of the recipes are from generations of grandmothers and mothers from Salvador. They literally make everything fresh right when you order. The wait is a little longer than other places but nothing beats fresh!!! And it's totally worth the wait. The flavors are bold and authentic. The decor on the wall is beautiful and place is kept clean. They have 5 locations across the valley and all use same great tasting recipes. A must try for authentic Latino/ Salvadoreños food"}
{"text":"The food was good but that was a shit show. They need a business model overhaul. Its apparent that there is a consistent issue with customer relations. My whole experience was a customer relations debacle but the food was good so it was ALMOST worth it- almost. It would be a shame for a business with good food to fail because it doesn't have direction."}
