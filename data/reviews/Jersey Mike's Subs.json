{"text":"If you love cheesiness you have to get the chipotle cheesesteak. It's honestly one of the best subs I've ever had. I've been a couple of times where the bread wasn't the freshest, and the AC was broken, but other than that I love it."}
{"text":"They have really great customer service at all levels (greeting, when taking orders, ringing up order, bringing out food and even when leaving). I always order the same thing, and it's consistently good."}
{"text":"After growing pains have gone away I am always given the amazing sandwich that this place has always been capable of making in execution.  Great team of kids in there. Hard for them( employees) I'm sure to be friendly and excited to sell sandwiches for minimum wage, but they do and they are."}
{"text":"This location reopened under new management a while ago.  Great food, service.  The #13 Italian dressed Mike's way is hard to beat.  I prefer this location over the one in Huntersville because it has a bigger, better dining area."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! The food was good and the place is spotless. I've had better sandwiches, we all have, but for a quick meal and a nice, quiet, clean place with a friendly staff this place was hard to beat. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Jersey Mikes, this particular location, definitely not. I've had several experiences with generally mediocre or poor customer service, but my precious visit was the last time I will go to this location. My sandwich tasted just like sanitizer water, the stuff in the red buckets they use to wipe down the counters, slicer etc. Bitter and not edible. When I told the employee, he stared at me like I was speaking a foreign language. I said it again, and asked if they had just wiped down the cutting board or something, and the two employees working made no effort to correct it whatsoever. Just blank stares and shrugs. I threw the sandwich away and paid for another meal at a different restaurant in the same parking lot. Food is fine, if you want to avoid repeating your order 2-3 times to the employee making your sandwich, get the right size drink cup, and have an incorrect sandwich fixed for you etc, then avoid this location."}
{"text":"Went in and got the #13 best sub I have had in a long time plus the mnger. Mike is a stand up guy with a great attatude.  Stand up food ! Stand up dude!"}
{"text":"I have ventured back to this location again and the staff seems to be better.  I am temporarily upgrading it; however, I will be back to check on the service."}
{"text":"It's a better sub then what you would get from the other sub places & it should be... $$.  The kids that work there don't care, so don't be surprised if they mess up your order or give you some attitude if you make a crazy request, like throwing on a few peppers."}
{"text":"If I could god it a negative review I would: The gentleman that was taking our order was super rude. While taking our order it seemed like an inconvience, like we were interrupting his time! As far as us calling our name to pick up our hot sandwiches, they set it on the counter right where our stuff was so I took it while we were ringing up. So of course I picked it up thought it was ours when I realized it wasn't ours,  I took it back up to the counter he then told turned his back toward us said \"unbelievable\" \"are you kidding me?\" And continued to shake his head! It was an honest mistake. On top of the other rude comments he made when he turned his back. Really? I'm a customer paying for my sandwich on vacation! I shouldn't have to deal with the attitude and unprofessional manner! If you don't like your job, then simply don't work at Jersey Mikes! I'm really truly upset at his dimeanor! Usually if you want customers to tip you or to come back you would treat them with respect! If I would have known I was going to be treated this way then I would have gone to McDonalds and paid $10 less vs paying $27 for a terrible experience! This is the worst location! Don't come here!!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased . Friendly staff that really cares and they make awesome sandwiches!!!!!!!! Fast and efficient service . Management and team you guys are running an awesome staff . Kudos to you alll ."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Pulled over near their parking lot with car trouble. The owner came out and gave us a coupon for a free sandwich. I didn't even know this place existed. Glad the car broke down because we discovered that this place makes some super delicious subs and they have an extremely friendly staff. I Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"nice people, greeted the moment I walked in. great sandwiches, so glad it's here! Will be back soon.. The Italian was super good and very filling."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with any choice here. Probably the best quick sandwich around, but it can be a tiny bit pricey for what it is. Been here several times though and always good and never an issue."}
{"text":"Work til 8 a couple nights a week. The past three weeks I have stopped there and I couldn't get food. Three weeks ago they ran out of bread,  week two sign in window was closed for technical problems and last week sign in window said closed due to power outage while the lights were on and staff was cleaning up. I have tried to call Lisa (owner) who seems never to be there and left message without a return call Every week I get same order 3 giant steaks and spend over $35. Not sure what goes on before 8pm, but don't waste your time driving out after 8."}
{"text":"I used to come in to this location about once a week.  Haven't been in for 3-4 weeks.  Sandwiches used to be my favorite in town.  The sandwiches were so large I had a hard time finishing, and they were mighty tasty!  However, the last few visits, the sandwiches were so skimpy that I have stopped going there.  I hear that the franchisee is going to change and maybe things will improve.  I certainly hope so."}
{"text":"So glad to see this place here.  The sandwiches are great. My Favorite is a Cheesesteak Hogie. The crew is top notch. Definitely my new favorite sandwich shop near home."}
{"text":"Always been a fan of Jersey Mike's. I'm from back East where delis are king and a quality sandwich is easy to come by. Out here in the desert, not so much. Jersey Mike's makes it like we do back East. This particular shop is a cut above the standard shop though. The guys behind the counter are always courteous, quick and seem genuinely concerned about putting together a good product. They remember you when you go back, and it feels more like a neighborhood deli from back home. Great spot and it's become my go to for lunch."}
{"text":"Love the place. The staff is top notch, the food is excellent and the cleanliness of the place is the best I have ever seen in a restaurant. I loved it when the kid behind the counter said to me \"Please give me a minute to wash my hands before I prepare your food\". Doesn't get any better than this. Thank you Jersey Mikes on Durango & Warm Springs!"}
{"text":"They were out of salt and vinager chips.  Hopefully they were just out but still carry them."}
{"text":"First time I had Jersey Mikes was in Myrtle Beach. I thought I discovered some kind of local awesomeness. Veggies that were shredded/sliced appropriately thin, but generously dolled out. Meat that is sliced for each individual sub.  When I came back to Ohio, I found out its a chain, and I wanted to see if I had just lucked out, or if it's a real deal great sub.  Well it still is a great sub, and I did luck out finding this place! They slice your meat to order at every location, the bread is great, and although it's a bit more expensive than most sandwich shops, that's because it's better than most sandwich shops. The online menu does not offer their cheesesteak, but they make them, and they are also awesome!"}
{"text":"I came in here a couple weeks ago with my dad for the first time for a nice lunch . I have to say I'm not really a big sub or sandwich person so I was kind of nervous but this was amazing . :) It was so fresh , warm and tasty ! Not to mention the restaurant and service was awesome . So friendly and make you feel welcomed :) Definitely can not wait to go back soon !"}
{"text":"I was not all that impressed with Jersey Mike's.  The sandwiches were only okay -- they put WAY too much lettuce on them.  I could hardly taste the meat because of all the toppings that they put on it.  Also, I ordered my sandwiches online and when I got there, after the time I was told they would be ready, I still had to wait for them to be made.  The excuse given was that they got busy, but I believe that pre-orders should be ready when they are supposed to be ready and walk-ins done around the pre-orders.  And the excuse of being busy didn't wash.  There were only two people in the store and 5 employees. How hard would it be for one of those employees dedicated to on-line orders as they come in?  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I want to start my review by saying Jersey Mike's is my favorite sub chain .however,this location staff are disrespectful and they have attitude problems.I would not go back to eat there . Business with no management =0 They charged me for extra money as welI .I orderd the full size sandwich to save but the guy There charged me for two small subs ."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this particular location since it first opened and I've only had one bad experience. It had nothing to do with the food quality but the dishonesty of an associate. Approximately a year ago I was having lunch and I accidentally left my iPhone 6 Plus at this restaurant. I went back to the restaurant 3 separate times and utilizing the Find my iPhone app and also the AT&T store which is directly next door. The app was stating that my phone was in the restaurant so I went back in again for the fourth time. Now, when I was searching frantically and asking the manager about my phone. The manager just said that he had my phone and that he said here it is. The manager who cleaned my table held it he entire time. What a jerk!!! Luckily that person isn't at that location anymore because that's why I'm back watching there. While he was there I didn't eat there. Thank goodness he's gone and it seems like there are good people working there now."}
{"text":"Im a believer, no offering required. I had Jersey Mike's  Original Italian. Great flavor good size. I have not tried any hot subs yet but my guess is cold subs is their specialty. If you eat a giant sub be prepared to dvr all the sports games and reality shows you lie about not watching."}
{"text":"Literally the cleanest store I have ever seen!   Amazing staff  Soooooooo friendly and the manager Mike is awesome.  Good job guys!   And the food is to die for"}
{"text":"This was my first time getting a Jersey Mike's sandwich. I'm normally more a Capriotti's girl, or Subway on my way home. I decided to try Jersey Mike's a few nights ago since I was already in the area.  The main draw of Jersey Mike's is in their fresh sliced meats. As in, they don't slice it until you order it. The meats were flavorful, and had none of that slimy quality that Subway can get. They have fewer topping options, mainly lettuce, onion, & tomato, which is why I only gave them 4 stars. If you want cheese, you need to ask for it.  I went with the 13, with 6 types of meat, and put both the red wine vinegar and the oil on top. The sandwich was good, at about the same price of Capriottis. I will definitely come back, and work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been here a number of times and always get the #13 Original Italian.  Not a bad sandwich at all, but I always have to make sure I ask for them to go light on the vinegar and oil or else they FLOOD the sandwich with them.  So, made right it's not a bad sandwich but I prefer other sub places.  The reason I rate them so low is I tried the Philly Cheesesteak today.  WOW, ZERO flavor!!  I ate half the sandwich and gave up.  This by far is the worst and most flavorless cheesesteak I've tried in the Phoenix area so far.  Moving here 3 years ago, I've tried a number of cheesesteak places trying to find one that compared to my favorite place back home.  I've found a few good ones and some bad ones, but this was by far the worst.  I can only recommend that Jersey Mike's PLEASE add some type of seasoning to your meat on these things.  My wife and I both tried them and the only taste was from the other ingredients (cheese only on mine and mushrooms on hers).  I hate giving bad reviews, but really felt I had to put something out there....maybe the restaurant will learn something from it.  If you're going to Jersey Mike's, stick with the subs unless you like a warm cardboard sandwich for lunch, then try the cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. The younger dark girl who made our sandwiches (I think she said her name was shawny or something) was super friendly and smiley and nice. I ordered a sandwich and asked for double meat, expecting it to cost anywhere between $1-3 (I used to work at subway). She told me it would cost extra, I said it's fine. Then the manager rang me up and it was $15!! I was shocked, she asked if I wanted my receipt and I said yes, and I noticed she charged me twice for double meat which alone totaled to $5. When I confronted her about it she denied it and then said they have an \"extra meat\" option AND a \"double meat\" option, WHO KNEW?! Not only did they not mention it to me or inform me, ITS NOT EVEN WRITTEN ANYWHERE ON THEIR DAMN MENU. The manager was such a fucking bitch, didn't even offer to give me my money back, let alone APOLOGIZE?! Nothing at all. I told her they need to explain that to customers because we don't have any way of knowing and she just gave me this rude sarcastic ass smile and said OKAY! Fucking ridiculous, I feel bad for the poor sweet girl that has to deal with that thing managing her. Never going back to this location again.  Ps - I also noticed ants all over the floor when I was done eating my sandwich"}
{"text":"My family placed an online order but part of our order wasn't right. We paid for bacon but no bacon was on the sandwich. I called the store immediately and spoke to Tommy. He told me he'd make a note for me to get my sub replaced. I called today, Wednesday Mar. 1, to see if he's there before going to redeem the free sub offer. Tommy answered and told me he didn't see his note so I MUST HAVE already picked up the sandwich. He's basically calling me a liar and a sub thief. I'm NO liar. Their errors have me very upset, NOT the food. Piss poor service 100%."}
{"text":"Wow! Everyone here is so nice. I came in to pick up some sandwhiches for a business retreat. They did not recieve my order and so my order wasn't ready to be picked up. Instead of making a big deal about it. They called the manager, confirmed the order, and had all 50 sandwhiches ready in no time. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"For being a new store the staff is friendly and on top of it. I wish I caught the name of the employee that was super friendly. She is very enthusiastic and took the time to make sure that the new employee was trained properly. The friendly staff and the high quality food will keep me coming back!  Try the cheese-steaks!"}
{"text":"Awesome food,  The vegetarian sub is good. My 2 sons beg me too eat subs every week.  Boys favorite subs are the original Italian and the turkey sub. Husband likes it. Good price.  Good philycheese-steak. Big portions and lots different subs. In conclusion I wouldn't go anywhere else for subs."}
{"text":"Decided to give it another chance (no cold sore sightings).  Had the Club Supreme Mike's Way.  The sub was good and the restaurant is clean.  Overheard one of the staff apologize to a couple for not having a chance to clear the table where they wanted to sit.   If subs are your thing, Jersey Mike's is good when compared to the Subway's and Blimpie's of the world.   For me, favorite subs I've had are from a little sub shop in the little college town of Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania."}
{"text":"When my family and I walked in the this Jersey Mike's on a Saturday at 2 pm, the staff was busy working on making what looked to be a large to-go order. We stood at the counter waiting to order for a few moments before we were asked what they could make for us. There was no actual greeting, just asked us what we wanted. The staff started our kids meals and then walked away. I wasn't sure if it was to get something or what. The kids sandwiches were done but our other sandwiches took several minutes longer to make. We were not given the option of adding lettuce, tomato, pickle, etc.. . I guess they just come the way they come. My sandwich was fine but my fiancé's chicken parm was rubbery. The floor had debris from people eating that needed to be cleaned up under many of the tables. For a $35 meal we could have had better service at Subway for half the price."}
{"text":"Went by the other day - this is the Jersey Mike's I always head to. They have the nicest employees and the sandwiches are always excellent. Just like everyone says, get it Mike's way. We do the Italian and the ham. Tip: call ahead to pick up and skip the line."}
{"text":"A young woman named Bella who works there is an asset to the company!  She works very hard and hope she is appreciated by the company!"}
{"text":"Good subs made with fresh sliced-to-order meats and cheeses. This location in Stonecrest is the first of theirs I've visited and I was immediately impressed. The service is quick and friendly, the bread is fresh (typical white or wheat sub rolls, or they also do wraps) and their \"Mike's Way\" preparation with onion, lettuce, tomato, dressing and spices is delicious. The sandwiches come in 3 sizes to fit all appetites. I think they also do a deal on Tuesdays where you can get a regular size sub, chips and a drink for $5. I've yet to take advantage (we typically go on the weekends when we visit Stonecrest to take in a movie), but sounds like a great deal."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Jersey Mike's subs and especially coming to this location. The staff is very friendly and it is so close to work! Maxwell prepares the subs with style and does them Mike's Way perfectly!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this jersey mike's. Great quality ingredients, clean, and the employees are all super friendly and patient to take your order. Love this location and the employees. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"**lunch only during the weekday***  I guess this is a new location. It wasnt busy when i walked in but its like as soon as i was done ordering there was about 5 people that walked in and continued to be busy so my timing was on point!! Got a #17 regular (since i had a coupon for a free sub) its really good!! They use ribeye meat! U serious?! Yes pls! They call out ur name for the order and my sandwich was made really fast. Got the tasty cakes coz i was curious. Sweet tea not so sweet but it was tea.   Def returning and PAYING for an actual sandwich.  Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Went in today and noticed they had risen their prices. The lady working the register confirmed that for us and that some locations had gone up even higher. Jersey Mikes was always expensive for subs but to top it off, they got rid of their daily specials! Their subs are good but paying $11-$13 for a regular combo is just ridiculous. Plenty of better values in this area."}
{"text":"Awesome food consistently.  Great leadership/owner is no doubt the secret behind this location's success.  Quality food served quickly & professionally! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!"}
{"text":"I love going into jersey mikes! Just moving from Arizona I had to find the closest one to me which is this location. I love how much you get for the price and how fresh it is, unlike subway. The two people there closing were amazing! They talked to us while ordering and made sure we liked everything. I loved that they didn't rush is even though they closed in 15 minutes. I will definitely come back here again. I love everything they make!"}
{"text":"At first I was a fan of this business. I've only ever eaten from this location. Recently, over about the past month or so, JM's has been falling into the same trend as a lot of other local eateries; getting orders wrong. Worse though is tonight where my friends and I were blamed for placing the order incorrectly. I'm not sure how you can misinterpret \"beef\" as \"chicken\" but it has happened."}
{"text":"yummy.  So fresh and by far, the best sandwich place.  They might be pricier, but to me, you get what you pay for.  If you want crappy lunch meat that was sliced a week ago, go to Subway."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened to this location over the last 2 years, but I will not go here again. The service has gotten consistently worse, but the experience I had today was just awful, as the guy that was pretending to help me was not paying any attention and asked me what I ordered 4 times - and I was the only customer! Once he finally began making 1 of my 2 sandwiches, a buddy of his walked in the door and he actually stopped working on my sandwich to start making a wrap for his guy. Seriously??? When I said something he started on my order again and just threw it together as quickly as he could, all meat on one end, all veggies on the other and just soaked with oil and vinegar. He then started to ring me up when I reminded him I ordered 2 sandwiches, so he ran in the back real quick to make the meatball sub and (no joke) threw it in the microwave right before he put it in the bag - didn't even wrap it in foil to keep it warm. Needless to say, my wife said the sub was awful and the meatballs tasted like they were burned.  I honestly should have just walked out. Absolutely pathetic - and I highly recommend that others avoid this place, just as we will from now on."}
{"text":"The subs are great. However it seems lately they are without turkey. Four times in the last month I have arrived to find there is no turkey. Also too many times their machine is down that keeps track of your points. Harris Teeter and Publix are within walking distance. Both offer great subs as well and less expensive."}
{"text":"Subs are great but unless you want it Mike's way you're out of luck. Can't hear employees through the glass and apparently they can't hear you either."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich place in the world. My chicken was undercooked and was mostly fat. I asked for light mayo and mustard twice and they seemed to ignore the request  because my sandwich was 80% mayo and mustard. I ended up trashing pretty much the entire sub and as a consequence my money...Never again!!!"}
{"text":"The staff is super organized and friendly. I have never had a bad experience here, and even if it busy the staff always greets you and asks how your day is doing. I have been to other locations and I always regret going because this one is the best."}
{"text":"I love the subs here but the customer service is HORRIBLE. Pay close attention to the men that work there. They don't have any customer service at all!! Love the subs, so much! This is my 5th time going to this particular location and they did not greet me when I walked in. HORRIBLE Staff!"}
{"text":"I love all Jersey Mikes, always. The subs are superior over all other chain sub shops. The guys at this specific shop are crazy nice and actually wanted to chat and offer great service. My sandwich is great every time I go here and thats what I love most about Jersey Mikes, the consistency. Any time I'm at the mall and find myself hungry, its worth the short ride across the street to get a sub from these guys."}
{"text":"Love that they actually use a griddle to make hot subs rather than a microwave like the other places.  No one else slices their meats per order like they do.   I tried their philly cheese sandwich and it was yummy!   I don't like their tip options which force you to choose when they turn the tablet over for you to sign.  Cashier is watching you and it's an uncomfortable feeling.  I didn't think making a sandwich entitled someone a tip... is it just me?  From now on, I'm going to pay cash to bypass that whole guilt-trip experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the sandwich that my Wife brought home, we get a Giant Turkey and split it but for some reason whomever made the sandwich literally put 1 layer of Turkey and a lot of lettuce and tomatoes. Never had such a skimpy sandwich made there before, comon guy's, stop skimping, your making yourselves look bad..."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 boxes of subs for my son's Eagle Ceremony.  They had them ready and were a big hit at event- all gone by the end.  A little expensive but worth it for great food- especially since I didn't have time to make anything.   Staff was friendly and restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We have heard that this place had great subs.  We stopped in for the first time and found that the menu is lacking in multiple ways.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place actually gets any good reviews ! The sandwiches are at best mediocre nothing special at all .... And the prices .... Ridiculous !  1 regular sub / 1 mini  and 3 SMALL drinks with 1 bag of chips for over 22  dollars.... !!! Yikes ! Then .... When checking out and paying a screen pops up about how much TIP you want to give .... And they give you a suggestion of 15 or 20 percent... If I can help it I would never go back or recommend to anyone !"}
{"text":"Always a fantastic choice for lunch. I always get a buffalo chicken \"hot sub\". I walk in and most of the time they already know what I want. Excellent customer service and speed. Also if you have a large order you can order online and pick it up when it's done."}
{"text":"We ordered two subs, they put one in the bag and forgot to give us the second. Turns out they put it in someone else's bag. After realizing this, the cashier walked around the counter and rummaged through the other customers bag to retrieve my sandwich, then handed it over.   The subs weren't the best ever, but certainly better than Subway. The staff needs more training, they all looked lost. There was definitely no leadership in the building.  Overall, very odd and underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich online picked it up and got it home and it was not what I ordered.  I called and spoke with the manager who was initially very rude.  She blamed me for the sandwich being wrong but said that I could get come in for a replacement later that week.  When I ordered my replacement I ordered it online and paid intending to get a refund so that I didn't have to wait in line.  Which is the whole point of online ordering.  When the manager did the refund,  She started to read my credit card number out loud in a store full of people while she was putting it in the computer.  I had to ask her to stop.  She didn't apologize and again blamed me for the mix up. Considering I was dealing with the store manager and received such poor service twice I will not be returning!  They need to reconsider the management."}
{"text":"Yummy is all I can say!!  Great turkey!! Very filling. My new favorite. Fresh neat and at great cost"}
{"text":"The location has Very good subs, but they don't toast them like Subway...disappointing. The bread is much better than Subway, although there are not many items to  put on the sub, compared to Subway that used to be in the same location."}
{"text":"Reading reviews after eating my sub has me puzzled. The staff is extremely friendly and gave me suggestions having never been here. When I walked in management team of about 7 was having a meeting so it seems they are genuinely interested in making their chain/store better.  I ordered the California Club Mikes Way with no tomato & it was very good. I can't believe other sandwich shops are in business with chains like these. Meat, cheese, lettuce, avacado, etc. all tasted very fresh. I also got a free cookie having it been my first time here :)  One minor complaint is the location of the store. The plaza looks a little run down & could detract from their business.  I would suggest it & would like to see one of these chains in the East Bay. They'd do good business."}
{"text":"My mother and I stepped into this location yesterday, and I could not have imagined better service!! Both Latoya and Iesha (I hope I did not butcher their names) were extremely friendly and had great customer service. They made all 3 of our sandwiches exactly like we wanted, but their friendly attitude will be why I come back. They found out I was getting married and they were so excited! They even threw in some free cookies with our order all for being a bride. This is how service is supposed to be and they made my day that much better with their upbeat enthusiastic personalities! I would give them 5 stars any day."}
{"text":"First time here and not impressed.  My order was wrong and the person making my sandwich did not bother to try and fix it. Instead he kept making it and ignoring my request.  Another employee fixed it after explaining the situation.  Flies everywhere staff's unfriendly and I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Awful customer service will not be back."}
{"text":"Visited for first time today.  It was expensive but I believe the quality is worth it.  They slice the meat in front of you.  Subway not even in same league.  I would definitely go again.  I'm assuming they had 10 employees in the little store because it's so new???"}
{"text":"Just what I needed today! Best Italian sub  I've  had in a long time. Although any sandwich would have satisfied me. Fresh bread. Fresh sliced cheese and meat piled high with fresh cut veggies, topped with oil, vinegar and that oh so special seasoning. Yum! Service top notch. The last time I ate here locally was 7 or 8 years ago. I live out of the area. Came in and immediately recognized the man and woman from over on Lorain Rd in Fairview Park. I was told they moved here about a year ago. So happy I found them today. Hands down the leader among sandwich shops in southwest Cleveland suburbs. I have a long history with Subway which is quickly losing market share. The inconsistency with their bread from location to location is terrible.I cant stand the precut lettuce and preservatives in a bag. JJ's is like the Walmart of sandwich places. It will do in a pinch but if I have a choice I would go somewhere else. Penn Station and Di Bella's reminds me more of Quiznos. Again okay for certain sandwiches only. Jersey Mike's I could eat the whole menu. Definitely my lead horse in the great sandwich race. Will go out of my way to return as soon as possible. Thank you"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's, by far, has the best deli meat of any deli sandwich shop in Charlotte."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY FRIENDLY SERVICE!!! Very kind workers. I had a chipotle cheesesteak giant. It was done in a couple of minutes. Very impressed with the food and service overall. I wish this shop was closer to my house. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"While I enjoy their food, I'm very disappointed in their business practices.  I knew the time of closing was 9 o'clock, but I still checked the website to be sure before I traveled the 8.7 miles to pick up food for my coworkers When I arrived at their location it was 20 minutes of nine,  when I walk through the door, even though there were people eating in the restaurant, I was told that it was slow tonight so they're closing early.  Everything was cleaned up and they're so sorry that they couldn't make me any sandwiches. I asked if I would be able to get cold sandwiches, their reply was no, but they were sorry.  I'm a business owner myself and it's very frustrating to a consumer to arrive at a location that is open until 9 and told that it was slow so we closed early.  I don't know if I'll return in the future.  The prices aren't cheap but the food is good. If you can catch them when they're open,  I'd call before you go to make sure that they are not closed."}
{"text":"It is hard to find a good sandwich shop in Arizona.  Jersey Mike's subs are good and tasty."}
{"text":"My saviors on days when i need a quick lunch or dinner during work, this location is off the hook. Liz always helps me out right away. She's always bringing good vibes and a smile on top of great service. The whole staff is super welcoming and its always made right the first time."}
{"text":"Big dude making the subs has a really bad attitude. He seems like he does not want to be there.  Cheer up dude! At least u have a job! Cashier is cool though. .."}
{"text":"I love this place. All the employees are all super nice everytime I come in and they seem like they have a good buisness."}
{"text":"I really enjoy my sandwiches here. The staff is always great and very friendly. I like the philly hot sub!!"}
{"text":"My sister told me to try Jersey Mikes since I eat a lot of Jimmy Johns. Ok so I tried it. At $12.45 for a footlong was a joke! It was not $5 better than JJ's by a long shot. Also, JJ's bread is A lot better!!"}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mike's and these amy be consistently the best sandwiches I've had from Jersey Mike's. Also, the lady that works at lunchtime is so sweet and helpful. I look forward to seeing her when I get my delicious sandwich."}
{"text":"worst customer service ever they are rude  it was great with the old clerks NEVER AGAIN needs some of the clerks when it first opened"}
{"text":"Have been eating here for a while,  was losing faith in this place with the night shift but the manager for the day shift is fair and doesn't play the customers. I was in the other day and had a member of the team named Vinnie Munoz help me,  this person was not only kind and helpful,  but accually went out of his way to make me feel welcome, way to go man. If corporate is looking for a model for future management they should look at this person,  when paying $14.00 for a sandwich,  it is nice to be made to feel like you are wanted back."}
{"text":"Best sub I've ever had! Fresh food and friendly workers. They literally slice the meat and cheese for your sub as you order it. Can't beat that! It is a bit more money than subway, but you get what you pay for and I have no issue paying a few more dollars for quality."}
{"text":"Ahhh jersey mikes. Sounds kinda like a truckstop you avoid on a long road trip but let me tell you my friends...it's definitely a stop you should make. The BREAD: soft, flaky and fresh. The MEAT: sliced fresh for every sandwhich. The toppings...different and very good.  You can order your sub \"mikes way\" and it will come with lettuce, tomatoes, white onion & LOTS of (too much imo) oil and vinegar... as for the prices,  i think the people complaing about an 11.00 samdwhich are failing to mention,  that size sandwhich is literally 3 meals! I get the regular sub which is still huge & end up eating one half for lunch & the other for dinner. You can get the mini which is plenty of food for ME (probably not enough  if your a guy or have a hefty appetite ) for under 5 bucks. One thing that constantly keeps me coming back is the customer service. I would much rather spend my $ in a place that takes pride in it's customer service,  listens, and gives you what you asked for than any other mediocre serviced sub shop offering a 5.00 footlong and an attitude.  Oh and another brownie point mikes scored on the board? They have fox news on. That a boy!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good drink and went to starbucks. Well next door is Jersey Mikes so I decided to check it out. Right when I walked in I was greated with a smile and friendly hello. I have never heard of this place so I let them know and then gave me a run down of the menu. Needless to say it sounded delicious so I had to get one. I went with the Original Italian, Mikes Way (the recomendation for all subs). I had to take it to go because I was pressed for time, but I got a free cookie for my first time...yum! Awesome cookies.  Id say all in all this is the best sub shop I've been to. They cut all the meats in front of you, the bread is baked daily and the roast beef is always perfect!"}
{"text":"5 stars hands down! I love this location! Especially today on my lunch break. When I walked in, all the employees had smiles on their faces and two instantly greeted me! It's always nice to see smiling faces especially after being at work all day. Also the food is extremely fresh and made to perfection! Thank you much! I will definitely continue to spend my lunch breaks with you guys!"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak in Madison. Fresh bread and good ingredients served hot of the grill. Great customer service from people who are attentive and make you feel welcome.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"somebody from the restaurant actually messaged me on here to \"set their record straight\" the manager called me a couple days later.. promised me coupons.. yet nothing came. OH and i told him my work hours and he conveniently said he would be in all week except for the hours i would be available LOLOL it was an all around fail for JM. havent been back since."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance and had the same poor experience as I did the first time, leading me to believe there is a pattern.    The service is incredibly slow. There was only a couple of people in front of me and they seemed to be friends of the staff. So the staff decided to chit chat for an exceptionally long time rather than moving them through and helping me with my order. Definitely not happy with that, especially since it happened BOTH times I visited.   Next comes the food and I have to say I was very disappointed. The bread was very dry and stale. Really poor quality that I am surprised they actually served. This also happened BOTH times I visited. I couldn't really get beyond that to comment on any other part of the sandwich.  Needless to say,  I won't be visiting Jersey Mike's again and putting myself through a needlessly long wait to get stale bread. If I could give them negative stars I would."}
{"text":"First let me say, I DO NOT eat fast food. Ever. I will go to the supermarket and buy fruit, veg, yogurt, nuts, etc, before I eat garbage. This place is NOT fast food! The ingredients are FRESH. Staff are NICE. Service is FAST. Really, if you need to get ur meal on and only eat good food, THIS is the place!!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge Jersey Mikes fan.  The food is always great and the people are really friendly at this location. Now for the down side, I have visited this location numerous times and I would have to say about 50% of the time my order is made wrong. The staff is obviously either distracted by other things or they are just not listening to you which is frustrating. This is annoying enough to make me not wanna come back."}
{"text":"I lived in jersey for a bit, and my dad owned a deli there, so i have grown to appreciate an awesome jersey sub. jersey mikes has no competition in my mind. the service is awesome, so friendly. My fave is the #9!!"}
{"text":"Its about time they got a real sandwich joint out here..This place truly has the best sandwiches in town! ....if your looking for fresh meat off the deli slicer this is the place. An absolute must try!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great today, I got the cheesesteak and it was so delightful the one with the jalapeños . The last one I got was kinda whatever but I told the manager Greg and he made everything perfect for me ! Will definitely be coming back to this location soon !"}
{"text":"Poor service.  Inattentive behind the counter, the young lady ignored us in favor of chatting with co-workers.  Surprise, she didn't get our order right because she was not paying attention. This was especially inconsiderate because there were 4 people working and only 2 of us in line.  Food was good, but the meat to bread ratio was so far off it wasn't worth the $10+ price tag."}
{"text":"My first visit? 2Weeks ago. Experience..fantastic! The sandwich full to the brim with ingredients..steak..peppers and amazing tasting cheese and chipotle mayo...mmm..it was to die for.. I can still taste it.. Mmm.. so of course the following week I was treating a Co-worker to lunch and talked about this amazing sandwich I had ..how big and tasty it was.. so she's like great let's go... When she came back with the order I called in on.. Wednesday? (can't remember the day for sure) lets just say I was less then pleased... It looked like a subway sandwich with the amount of meat that was on it barely any cheese... filled to the brim with ingredients? I think not..I tasted one bite with chipotle mayo.. so first sandwich was perfection and the second was just pathetic."}
{"text":"Always choose this place for sandwiches. Always have great service, clean & has my favorite chips variety. It changes all the time, but they carry some great brands. I even wanted my sandwich hot ( the employee overheard me talking) they made it hot even though it's not the norm. I appreciated that. I never, EVER go to Subway...JM is my choice on my day off, close to home."}
{"text":"The subs are just okay :( but way to expensive for what you get. There are many other sub places to choose from in the area that are much better unfortunately."}
{"text":"The worst sub I ever had! The tuna was bad and the cold cuts are inferior! I was sick for 2 days!!! The board of health should check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"\"The Sub that Sunk\"    A solid three stars for the customer service at this new location with friendly service with the staff that seemed to be enjoying there time working with each other.  I did receive my free sub for the grand opening of this location, however even though the deli meats were sliced in front of you to prove the freshness of their ingredients, my Italian sub was \"A-OK.\"  I would consider going again because of the service, but maybe a second try with a different sub will satisfy my sub appetite.  I kept comparing it to Jimmy Johns Subs which are much tastier, however service is lacking."}
{"text":"Definitely the best sub in Vegas. I order the grilled chicken sub. It's not even on the menu but the friendly staff always make it for me anyway. Grilled chicken, served hot with American cheese. My only complaint is that the regular size is a little small but the giant size is, well, giant. Make an in between size!  Otherwise, love this place and am a regular. I always use the points. They don't make me carry around an extra card in my wallet. It just keys off of my phone number. They just really get it."}
{"text":"Good workers. Except the lady helped the couple behind me first before me which had a much bigger order. And noticed she wasn't in a great mood and slapped the sandwich together. Not the greatest location"}
{"text":"Best sub and location definitely. Got hot Chipotle steak with oil & vinegar on side. Absolutely a wow face. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Super bomb food I love the number nine the bread and the meat and the bacon all come together so well in my mouth ! Making me want one just thinking about it !"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but the obnoxious loudmouths behind the counter insure I will take my sub business elswhere."}
{"text":"Good sub but on the expensive side. Also they don't have Fries!! And everytime someone orders a hot sub the entire staff yells HOT STUFF!  It's frickin Annoying! !!!!!!!!!! And serves no purpose! Quit it!"}
{"text":"I got a tray of subs and a tray of wraps for my annual Super Bowl Party.  What a hit! They were beautifully prepared in individual sleeves that said \"Jersey Mike's\" but I took them out to put them on my own serving platters.  Everyone kept saying, \"Where did you get these subs?\" \"Where are these from again?\" \"These subs are SO good!!\" I made such a great move getting these sub platters!!  Thanks, everyone at Jersey Mikes for making my Super Bowl Party so great!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been at this location 3 times in the past month and can't rate it high enough. Very cordial and friendly staff, excellent sandwiches. Totally unfair to compare this to Capriotti's, Subway, Firehouse, or Port-a-Sub. This is the gourmet of subs, in my book. The ingredients are freshly sliced in front of you, the tastiest bread, and flavor abounds. Sure it's a bit more expensive than the other places, but the care, flavor and service are all there and worth it."}
{"text":"This is the best of the sandwich chains. The person who compared it to Subway must be crazy. Jersey Mike's is far superior to Subway. They cut their meat and cheese fresh, and pile it on. I always get the same thing- turkey and swiss- and it's delicious every time. It's a little pricey and definitely high in calories, but totally worth an occasional splurge."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch this week with my daughter.  Staff were friendly.  Food was good quality.  Bright and clean  Really pleasantly surprised.   Definitely go here. Again"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick sandwich shop then this place beats the competition hands down. The meat comes freshly sliced not prepackaged like other franchises. Always a good customer experience with the friendly staff at this location. This is your stop if you want a quality sandwich with an east coast taste."}
{"text":"There bread really ruins it for me.  I cant believe that there is a sandwich that I dont like but I finally found it here.  The bread just tastes funny to me I cant even eat it.    The Staff is nice and I hear good thing from other people the place is just not for me."}
{"text":"Good service. My favorite sandwich is Mos def the big kahuna."}
{"text":"I love love love me some Jersey Mikes! There is one sub in particular that I always get... THE ITALIAN! Now I dont like provolone and I always ask for pepper jack cheese instead, but to my surprise the University location shot down that delicious idea! They dont carry pepper jack! That was the least of my worries though because I can choose another cheese no biggie... the problem was that the techno/house music that the young team of employees were playing was too loud. So loud that I stopped in the middle of my order because it was hard enough to think let alone hear the words that were coming out of my own mouth. I had to repeat myself a couple of times. Once the initial ordering process was over I waited for the young man to freshly slice the yummy selection of meats for my sanwich when I heard him and two other employees cracking jokes about a customer that had just left. I understand young people like to have fun and joke around, but they could have picked a better time LIKE.... I don't know... after all of the customers had left.   Summary of my experience.... The music was too loud and I was disappointed in the way the employees carried themselves, but my food was delicious even with the swiss cheese. I wouldn't recommend this particular Jersey Mikes over another one, but I will continue to go there because it is close to where I live. If it wasnt convienient I would be finding another location to buy my favorite sub from."}
{"text":"Good bread and meats. Staff was friendly. Little more expensive than subway or mr. Goodcents. But I enjoy it mikes way!"}
{"text":"This was the first and last time I ever eat from this store. All the other stores I've gone to have always served up a very good cheese steak. Not here. The roll was cold like it was just pulled out of a bag. Not steamed or toasted and not soft. Also a few hours after I ate I got sick to my stomach."}
{"text":"I enjoy the unique taste and size of jersey mikes subs, but I do not understand the craze overall.  The quality of the product is mediocre at best ( definitely better then subway quality). The price does not match the quality which hinders me to keep coming back.   If your looking for decent subs that are different from the norm, then jersey mikes is your place. Overall the bread is the weakest aspect of the sandwich, which makes or breaks the whole sandwich.  The lack of advertisement is the biggest positive for this franchise .  Since the place is just like any other fast food dinning, I only give 2 stars for the food."}
{"text":"My go-to place for a cold sub. Always fresh ingredients, and consistency at all locations is what I love about a Jersey Mikes. No matter the store I stop by for lunch, the sandwich is always delicious. You can't go wrong with the 2, 8, or 9.   JM's has a great \"Shore Points\" program now that you can use at every visit in order to gain points towards free subs. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Came back her on Tuesday to get my girlfriend the number 13 again. I never ate at this sub shop before. LaToya recommended me her favorite sub the number 43 a chipolte cheesesteak with peppers and onions. When i say the customer service here is great. She said if didn't like the sandwich she will make me any sandwich on the menu for free. I've never heard of that before. She makes sure you are truly happy before leaving.  The 43 is by far the BEST sub I've had coming from L.A California. Thanks for taking time to talk with me. Good luck to you and your business."}
{"text":"Their #13 Italian sub is consistently the best sandwich I have found. Fresh sliced in front of you, piled on with the right veggies and the juice is just enough that blends the sandwich together."}
{"text":"Very good customer service.  Meat is high quality.  Just cost a little more than Subway, but taste better."}
{"text":"Every time  I come in to this place I feel welcomed! They have great customer service and the food is always on point. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I like the food, just think it's too expensive. Small sub with drink  $10?"}
{"text":"Had dinner once , subway style but with less add on. Got the tuna sub , delicious but a little bit on the sweet side. The staff is fast , seating capacity and parkings are good. Overall decent sub restaurant ."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. Walked and the lobby was clean. It was close to closing time. They only had one more peice of bread to make a sandwich or the option of a wrap. Chose the bread which wasn't bad but nothing to smile about. They didn't have anything covering their counters so it really didn't seem sanitary or care about any cross contamination. The only toppings they have are very basic with lettuce, tomato, onions, and oil and vinegar which the server dowsed the sub in it was ridiculous. Prob won't be going back. I'll make the drive to silver mine subs on kyrene."}
{"text":"I ordered a regular #13 on white mikes way the sub was fine however i wont be back, charging almost 9 dollars for a sub to take home without a soda , chips or extra meat is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The #13 Italian, done Mike's way, is The BOMB!!! I stop by and pickup a Large  whenever I am in the Chardon area!"}
{"text":"Great subs! I really love the turkey. It tastes fresh and is healthy! Staff is always friendly"}
{"text":"Staff is fantastic and my sandwich is always fabulous. My 9 yr old loves this place! Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Jersey Mikes I've ever been to. Not only was my sandwich smashed, but it was extremely small with barely any toppings. This is NOT the Jersey Mikes quality I am used to. Pretty upset the staff didn't offer to re-make my sandwich when I said I was dis-pleased with the thickness of the meat, Jersey Mikes subs typically have shaved meat - this was GROSS!!!"}
{"text":"We love Jersey Mikes subs, but the employees here are all consistently rude with a horrible attitude.We used to go here often only because it's closer than the other jersey mikes 30 minutes away, so this isn't a one time thing. The employees have no problem letting you know just how much you're bothering them just by you stepping into the shop. The most unwelcoming place we've ever been in. They just stare/glare at you instead of saying \"hello can I take your order\" or something of that nature. They mumur their questions then get angry when you can't understand them. They generally always get my hot sub order wrong because when I ask to have toppings put on after it's done cooking, they just wrap it up and hand it to me...they either just don't listen or forget in the time it takes to order my sub until it's done cooking. The employee situation here is sad and unacceptable and something needs to be done. Hire better people who will actually enjoy (or least pretend to enjoy) their job. If that requires paying them more, then it's worth it.   We would eat there far more often if we didn't feel so unwelcoming every time we went in. The 2 star rating is only for the food itself (delicious!) Your staff here on the other hand don't deserve one star."}
{"text":"Does it get any better than this? Not IMHO. A ton of sub places out there, and these beat all. Sorry Firehouse, but you have been relegated to second place. I had the Club Supreme, and I don't think I have ever had a better sub."}
{"text":"Awesome sub considering it is a chain!   So wish there where more in the area!   Not a lot of seating so can be crowded at times but the flavor makes up for it.  Mikes way is the way to go!   Add some pepper relish if you like hot and spicy!    YUMMMMMM"}
{"text":"I gave it 3 stars because the counter people were good, however $13? For a sandwich that's mediocre at best. I could've got a fresh (of the bone) turkey sandwich At Capriotti's for 2/3 the price. I find that to be a little expensive considering some of the deals you get around town.  Bottom line: Too Expensive....."}
{"text":"Super friendly and attentive staff, the turkey in the sub I purchased was fine, but the rest of the ingredients were low-quality bland central and very little selection.   Wouldn't go back, sorry."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places, fresh ingredients, great owner and service and a very comfortable place to relax and eat."}
{"text":"Wow! Good ole classic subs! I am from Jersey and when I ate these for lunch at a meeting I flew into Vegas for I was like DAMN! The sandwich totally reminded me of all the subs I used to get back home. That night it had me craving subs..that is something I never crave. YUM! You need to open one in Downtown Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Good food. Can be a little tight in there so if they ask for here or to go, say to go so you get a bag for your sandwich. It will be easier when getting your drinks (especially if you have kids with you). Mikes way is excellent, I'm not an onion fan but it works here. I read another post about a lot of employees standing around... It's good because it goes fast, but sometimes I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to be talking to or if they are talking to me. Although this is some great multi tasking. They are making my sandwich and listening to the next person behind me and have yet to mess up my orders.   Would like a little more room in the restaurant but I probably go at high traffic times and I'm not there all day so I can deal with it"}
{"text":"Husband had #3 which is ham and provolone  Freshly slices deli meats and cheeses which is a plus!! I had the philly cheese sandwich on wheat. The bread is like cardboard. No flavor. Not tasty ... Women watching their carb intake will be very disappointed to waste their carb usage on the bread here.  Meat was sparse in my sandwich. Overly cheesed up to bulk the sandwich. Not cool. Not returning.  3 stars because I respect that they cut up deli meat and cheese from a cube right in front of you... That's rare.. Can't find that at a subways or togo's.... Ya feel meh.. So I'll up to a 3 ..."}
{"text":"We just had such a wonderful experience for a quick lunch. The staff was friendly despite a very busy day for them and got our food made quickly. I had the Italian on wheat and it was supper delicious! Very fresh and we even added cherry peppers!! I definitely wasn't expecting this level of deliciousness but it is tied in my book with Capriotti's. Definitely coming back and we are now rewards members!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a #6 Giant Roast Beef at this location and it barely had any meat in it. I even mentioned \"aren't you going to put any meat in it?\" and they still didn't. Not even all the way to the end of the sandwich and it only had One Slice of meat. I didn't realize I ordered a Bun Sandwich! :) It was so bad I even wrote/emailed Jersey Mike's Support and they never responded. This Review is actually older because I waited for the response I never received from their Corporate Headquarters. This isn't the first time that Jersey Mike's has disappointed at other locations. Perhaps I should learn and not go back? I don't know how they can treat their Customers like this and stay in business?"}
{"text":"Looking for a place that has good subs this is it. I have eaten the combo and the philly cheese steak both are excellent. Bread is fresh and prices are good too. They have text special combo meals."}
{"text":"#7 Turkey and Prov forever!  Love that sandwich, and of course, Mikes Way.  Kills any other franchise sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is great, always a fresh sandwich.. Must try number 13, you will love it! The employees always greet you and make sure you get what you want! It sucks that they don't toast but it is still good with the toppings, I get it \"mikes way\""}
{"text":"Had it for the 1st time few days ago the chipotle sub was really good! Service was top of the line really recommend it, just warning the giant is really a giant! Hahaha"}
{"text":"If you have to charge airport prices the staff and crew could care more about making the sandwiches good.  Soda's ice was completed melted by the time I sat down, 4 handfuls of lettuce, and waaaay too much mayo.   Not up to Jersey Mikes standards.  Still the best sandwich but the Vegas airport location was disappointing."}
{"text":"That was the worst sub I have ever had in my life (Chicken Parm).  The chicken was rubbery and the bread was mushy as all hell. BUT, my boyfriend's turkey sub looked really good and he confirmed that! It's my own fault for getting a hot sub at a \"Subway\" type place..plain and simple.  The place was clean and I like that they slice the meat for subs to order.  Maybe I'll try something else if I decide to go back."}
{"text":"on a return visit I was pleased with my turkey sandwich. The manager was sure my sandwich was just right by bringing out fresh sliced tomatoes and fresh bread. Still wish they had Dr Pepper on the fountain."}
{"text":"Horrible experience here this evening unfortunately, as we live in the neighborhood and would have gone here more in the future. When we asked for no cheese due to a dairy allergy, they still placed it on the bread. When my husband stated we didn't want cheese on that sub the young man scoffed, took the cheese off and continued to use the same sandwich bread. My husband asked nicely if he could use new bread as to avoid cross contamination and the young man was extremely rude about it and hesitated to do this. With allergies not being taken seriously it makes it a restaurant we cannot safely eat at, and that is very unfortunate. I would have expected better service, especially when a place is just opening up and needing to gain patrons."}
{"text":"A couple co-workers and I order lunch from here every Friday on FUN SUB FRIDAY!  The sandwiches are always very yummy, except I notice that the hot subs get soggy after only short time.  And, I am not a huge fan of the wraps.  They put WAY too much dressing on them and they fall apart very easily.  The Italian sub is one of my FAVORITES!  As well as the PHILLY... just as long as you get the bread toasted... that way it doesn't get soggy and make it hard to eat.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good fast sub lunch."}
{"text":"Food is good closest thing to a was a Howie you can find in the valley. ...staff is a bit on the rude side, was asked today what do you want in a certain unpleasant tone again what do you want."}
{"text":"Pretty good subs. I'm not much of a sandwich or sub eater but this was real good.  Got the supreme: great meats, fresh veggies, perfect oil blends and salt/pepper  Employees at this place were fun, nice and helpful.   I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Almost a perfect sanitation score (101), quick/brilliant staff, delicious product. Jersey Mikes uses great meats in their sandwiches which are sliced upon order. Leagues above subway, Jersey Mikes holds to the traditional sub route: big, tasty, and fresh.  This particular Jersey Mikes is the best one available in Concord, no doubt."}
{"text":"Slow moving employees that don't listen to the order taken. We ordered 2 subs and payed $24. RIDICULOUS. When you swipe your card to pay, it's prompts a tip line. Seriously? Your getting paid an hourly wage to do you job, and they want a tip for the bad service they provided?? No thank you, I'll go back to Subway."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, very clean sub shop and super friendly staff!!!!! Glad we stopped in. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Food quality is good, however staff is terrible, rude, and don't pay attention. I went into the store yesterday with my girlfriend and ordered two minis with a drink. Everything started fine until I ordered the subs,  which is when the manager and employees serving us started quietly talking about how we only ordered minis and then rolled their eyes at us. They tried to keep it quite so we wouldn't hear them but I did. Also while the employee making the sandwich was making it he forgot 2 of the 4 meats on my sub. Point being, the food is good however you have to pay attention to what they are putting on it and what they are forgetting(which should never be the customers responsibility) just to get a decent sandwich."}
{"text":"The best Italian sub out there.   Blows Subway and Port o Subs out of the water.   All meats are high quality and cut to order.   Bread is big and fresh.   Get it Mike's way.  Perfect.  I've never had any problem with the staff at this location.   Always able to get a parking space too."}
{"text":"Great subs in the off chance that they make it correctly. They handed me someone else's order and insisted that it was the correct order when I questioned it. Got home to find that it wasn't my order. They allowed me to come back the following day to correct the order - got home and it was wrong again. Jersey Mikes makes great sandwiches maybe just try a different location - maybe a gas leak at this one or something.."}
{"text":"It's hard to go wrong with a Jersey Mikes sub but I have got to give this guys credit for being so super friendly! They are just great. The place is clean and fast and, if you didn't know, they make their own roast beef in house. It's good!"}
{"text":"This review is long over do.  I love this place, I've been to different locations through out Nevada and California and I am never disappointed.  I've been a regular customer at this location for about two years.  The staff has change a few time and they have all been outstanding and polite.   My favorite sandwich spot."}
{"text":"I had a very unpleasant lunch yesterday at this Jersey Mike's location. My soda cup had a hole in it, spilled coke all over my shirt and I needed to get back to my workplace. Same thing happened to my coworker on the way back to work. Subs were poorly wrapped as well First time trying out this location, but sadly very disappointed."}
{"text":"I came into Jersey Mikes for a quick lunch and it was just what I was looking for! Andrew helped me and was so kind and helpful and answered every question I had! The entire staff seemed so friendly and happy to be at work. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. YES it gets busy around lunch time, but DUH its lunch in Charlotte. And it gets buys here because it's good and everybody wants it!! Hellloooo!!Service is great, Food is awesome."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location since it opened. I was really happy with the food, service and cleanliness of the restaurant until recently.  Today was especially disappointing. The service was extremely slow, had to wait a pretty long time just to order. Unfortunately there was no place to sit so we had to get our food to go. When we got home and unwrapped our Chicken Cheese Steak it was raw, cold and the onions were raw. I had to cook my sandwich myself."}
{"text":"It's a touch more expensive than your subway/quiznos type of place, but the service is unmatched and the sandwich is of higher quality.  The staff is courteous, helpful, and make you feel welcome.   I go every couple weeks for lunch and the service/food is on par every time.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"That was literally the worst experience of my life! 3 people \"working\" but only 1 ACTUALLY working. There was one couple in front of me in line and I spent 30 minutes in that place trying to get a sub to-go! I truly feel bad for the guy working while his two coworkers watch. I'll never go to that location again!"}
{"text":"Every time I go into this place they always have fresh bread and are always stocked up on delicious toppings and deserts. A plus about this place as well is they have Pepsi products! The service here is amazing as well they are always ready to serve customers with a smile on there face. This is a must stop sub place!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  All of the employees are super cool and very welcoming.  The hubs & I are making our way thru the menu, trying all the subs.  All the subs are fresh and the meat is cut right when you order it.  We have never left unhappy!"}
{"text":"Great subs! I've been going here for years... they cut the meat right in front of you, give you generouis amounts, bread is fresh, and staff is always pretty friendly. It is MUCH better than any subway or quizno's I've been to. Get your subs fully loaded, it is DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"We had decided to give this place a go because we had a coupon and hadn't been to a Jersey Mike's before. What the heck, right? The place seemed clean enough and atmosphere was fine for a fast food establishment. There were three clerks behind the counter and they weren't exactly welcoming but seemed competent. Again, fast food place. My husband ordered the chicken Parmesan, my eldest child and I both ordered Italians and the young one ordered a kid's meal.  My husband was not happy at the 'chicken' that came in his sandwich. He said that it tasted like they had cooked in three days earlier and left if under the heat lamp. My sandwich wasn't really bad, but it wasn't great either. They had accidentally switched my wheat bread for my daughter's white and had forgotten my peppers. We had a BOGO for a sandwich and drink and we paid $22 for the four sandwiches, two drinks and a kid's meal (after the coupon was applied). So it was competitive in price.   Will we go back? I doubt it. I would like to say I will give them another chance but with other restaurants available that I KNOW will make a good sandwich I don't see a reason to risk paying for another mediocre one."}
{"text":"This place is outrageously expensive. It's slightly better than Subway. The large sub cost me $15 it's highway robbery. I'll take my $15 elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Best peanut butter cookie I have ever had! Oh, and the subs and service are pretty awesome too. Always get great, friendly service."}
{"text":"Tonight was the 1st time I went to Jersey Mikes & will be the last, at least this location. As they were making my sandwich & asked if I wanted lettuce, tomato, etc. on it I said yes & as I looked down just as the lettuce was put on I realized it looked brown. It wasn't just a few pieces, it was what looked like half the container including what had been put on the sandwich. I asked what was wrong with the lettuce stating it's brown & the guy assured me it was fine & that it was freshly chopped earlier that morning. I proceeded to let him know it obviously wasn't fine, because perfectly fresh & good lettuce isn't brown. I asked if they had any fresher lettuce & he went out back & came back and said no they did not, but that lettuce fine. I told him it wasn't fine & I didn't want the sandwich & that they shouldn't be serving brown lettuce, if they didn't have any other lettuce, they shouldn't serve the lettuce at all. They didn't seem to care & I left without purchasing anything. How does one try & convince you brown lettuce is fresh, let alone try & serve it saying it's ok to eat. It's disgusting & should raise eyebrows to what could cause food borne illness."}
{"text":"Whoever the person was on shift today was so rude I got there at 5:50 (normally close at 9). Not only would he not serve me he wouldn't even make eye contact. I live by here and go here probably every other week. Now will never go again. The owner should know last person on shift today just cost you a customer. Ps I'll post a picture to prove it just so that dick who was working doesn't try to talk his way out of it."}
{"text":"Jersey mikes is a good place to eat at but this location was the slowest place I've ever been to!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Found a coupon in the mail for a regular sub meal (sub, chips, and soda) for $6.99 and went in for lunch the other day.  Since it was my first visit at a Jersey Mike's, I asked the order taker her recommendation and she said I should go with the #13 - The Original Italian done Mike's Way (all the fixings). It was a good choice and a decent meal, but I noticed the prices without the coupon would have been pretty steep, so I will keep my eyes open for another coupon and try something else next time."}
{"text":"First thing first, I haven't been to this location of Jersey Mike's for about a year (because I had food poisoning with them previously). However, they sent me a bogo coupon and I decided to give them another chance. But that was a mistake by me.  First: Awful customer service...Went in at 2pm and they were understaffed. Stood and waited 10 minutes until someone took my order.  Second: I requested extra meal and it was a total scam. The guy gave me one extra slice (yes I compared with the customer in front of me) and called it an extra $2.5 charge. The guy also didn't mentioned the price of extra meats until he sliced them, so I was kind of forced to pay. Ripoff 100%  Third: So somehow the bogo coupon doesn't cover extra meat (total of extra 2 slices on 2 subs), I had to pay $5 extra dollars for it, so basically I could almost bought another sub if I didn't ordered those extra meat.    I shouldn't even pay for it and asked them to do another one with no extra meat (if i was an ahole)  So no more Jersey Mikes for me I guess."}
{"text":"I actually went to the new location off Val Vista and baseline. I had the grilled pastrami Reuben and paired it with jalapeño chips. Great combo, delicious pastrami, good sauerkraut on top. I wish they put Dijon on it instead of thousand island (which I didn't taste really) but still a good sub.  I'd come back to try a few others."}
{"text":"So today a co-worker and I decide to go to Jersey Mike's on 17th street and camelback for lunch. I ordered a regular club sub and he ordered a BLT. His sandwich came out immaculate. Tons of bacon and the right toppings that he asked for. I on the other hand did not get the same service. After my cheese and meat were sliced, they then proceeded to weigh them. I asked for lettuce tomatoes and add pickles. The employee then reconfirm if I said pickles. I said yes, pickles please. She put two small strips of bacon and called it done. I didn't watch her assemble the sandwich as I was asked to pay ahead. Once I got back to work I found my sandwich with no pickles... The sandwich was still good... Just sucks that I didn't get the same service as my white co-worker did. Maybe I was too dark skinned... Idk..."}
{"text":"Went to this location last week. Apparently they did not have any bread available. Not sure why they still had the doors unlocked or open sign on. If you don't have one of the main staples needed for a sandwich, like bread, might want to close up until you able to restock. At the very least, light have been a good idea to shut off the open sign and/or put a note on the door so people didn't waste their time."}
{"text":"By far the best subs!!!  These subs are not for the faint hearted. Their giant is just that!!  Get it mikes way & don't forget the bacon... They are a good service restaurant,  always happy & friendly."}
{"text":"This location sucks.  I cannot begin to express my disappointment with the employees here.  My niece was refused service because she had a LEGITIMATE Service Dog!  It is against the law to not allow service animals!  I will NEVER EVER set foot into another Jersey Mike's!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Subs and KILLER Cheesesteaks! All high quality ingredients and you can taste the difference.  The line can be long at anytime of day but it is worth it. I like it \"Mike's Way\"."}
{"text":"First time here and I thought the food was great!  They are very limited on toppings though and have way less then subway does but other than that it was really good.  The people were friendly as well and when I thought there was not enough meat on my sandwich they instantly put more on without any questions.  Customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Deeply disappointed. Looked at the pics here and though of course it wouldn't be exactly like that, the large sub had a a tiny amount of turkey on it. Didn't coverage the sandwich and could see right through the middle in spots. I brought it up to the man making it and he just sort of smiled and shrugged his shoulders. I'm giving two stars instead of one because it was very fresh with good ingredients having it Mike's Way. Still with all the competition, I wont's be going back to be served with such meager portions.."}
{"text":"Admittedly I am not a fan of sub shops due to high-priced sandwiches of mostly bread, overload of veggies, and scarcely-used meat - ala Subway.    After seeing a Jersey Mike's TV commercial, a sub sounded good and I started my quest by Googling \"Jersey Mike's prices.\"  From their website the price for a \"mini sub\" was quoted in the range from $4.35 to $4.95 to try a sample-sized sandwich.  Upon arriving at this JM location, the first disappointment was the cost for the mini \"Famous Roast Beef\" at $5.95 - well over the quoted range.   I ordered and watched the construction of the sub: first two slices of provolone cheese, then two slices of the roast beef, then 6 thin raw onion rings, then 4 handfuls of shredded lettuce, dashes of vinegar, oil, and pepper - I had them hold the tomatoes.  I took the sandwich home.  After a  bite, I added a couple of dashes of much-needed salt.  The meat is delicious - when you can find it through all of the Bugs Bunny food in your mouth.  My impression is that the meat is much better than the 'lunch box' fair to be found at Subway, but the concentration (for the price) was inadequate.    The wheat bun was good and crumbles all over like old school sub buns are supposed to - I suppose. From a taste standpoint I could have boosted my rating higher, but the sandwich (like most other shops) is hugely over-priced for the bread/vegetable dominated concoction, especially at $5.95 for a 'mini.'    It seems the Phoenix-area market is getting gouged with costs that appear to be artificially high for \"fast food.\"  For $6 there are some pretty great burgers, sandwiches, and Mexican food dishes to be had. Sub sandwiches seem to be quite a racket - for what you actually get.  I thought Jersey Mike's might be an exception, but it isn't."}
{"text":"Great hot sandwhiches...and cold.   Pricy but good enough quality and service to justify cost."}
{"text":"This location has extremely nice workers, actually they all do! The sandwiches are always good, I've never been disappointed. The meat is in display and fresh every time. They are simple sandwiches but always good. I always get the turkey and provolone mikes way, yum!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch and grabbed a regular size meatball. At first glance, the portion looks a little small for the price you pay (about $8 for the sandwich alone). But once you start eating it, it's substantial and very filling.  The sandwich was fine. The meatballs themselves were pretty standard fare, similar to something you'd get at most other chain shops, but the bread and cheese were fantastic, elevating the whole package.  I like that they slice their meats and cheeses to order in house, and their bread may be my favorite among the major sub chains. As an overall experience, I'd probably put it second behind Firehouse, but it definitely rates ahead of Subway, Quizno's, or Jimmy John's for me.  Added an extra star for customer service, as all the employees have been above reproach every time I've eaten here."}
{"text":"Where's the meat? Just got a $12 sandwich that maybe had 25 cents worth of meat on it. Total ripoff, will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Slow service and was not busy.  More expensive than Firehouse and not better tasting.   $6.45 for a 7 inch turkey sub.  $11.95 for 14 inch.  That is before a drink or chips.  Why go?"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Original Italian\"- provolone, ham, prosciutto, cappacuolo, salami, pepperoni! I was really good, staff was really helpful and the place was spotless! I suggest you get their red pepper relish on ANY sandwich.  It was SO good! I will be going back really soon!"}
{"text":"I dont really care for subs, Because of \"subway and the other sub sandwiches locally are AWFUL. So a Friend of mine invited to Mikes, a bit out of the way, BUT worth it. By far the best sub in AZ. the staff was friendly, portion were okay also very clean. Will visit again soon."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's long ago (15+ years) was great and one of my favorites. This was disappointing. The subs are way over priced and not too great. I liked the fresh cut meats and the give you a good serving, but I won't be going back. I should have went to Subway or Fiori's. I'm sorry I wasted my money here. Ended up spending $25 for two \"regular\" subs. I also didn't like the loud pop music playing. That was very annoying."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a sub and boy was I happy I did. I had the sub club and it was fresh and tasty   I'll be back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"This place is great, not cheap, but very tasty! Not at all like subway - ingredients are fresh and their hot sandwiches are the best!  My only complaint is the wait... if you plan on stopping by on your lunch hour be prepared to wait, and wait, and wait. The place is crowded and the line does not move very quickly. I went in to pick up a large phone order, figured I could walk up to the register, pay, and get out of there. My food was bagged up and ready to go, but I was told to get in line. I was there for 25 minutes!!!!! Needless to say, most of the sandwiches got soggy...  I've been here several times since this incident, and love it - like I said before, the food is great but the wait sucks :)"}
{"text":"This is my spot! I feel like the employees know every person that walks through their door and it makes for a great environment that you don't typically see in 2015.   It's a \"sub shop\" but DO NOT file them away with the \"Subways\" of the world. This place is on a whole other level. The ingredients are simple and fresh. Meats are sliced on the counter right in front of you.  They have a rewards club, so rack up the points towards free menu items. Pepsi products on tap, TVs in the corners, and menu items to fit everybody's needs. (Veggie options,kids menu, etc).  Definitely worth a try but be careful because you won't want to ever eat a sub from anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for sandwiches in the Rocky River area. The staff is friendly and attentive as well as nice and quick in the making sandwiches. The sandwiches are better than competitors such as Subway because the ingredients are fresher.  I wouldn't even put Subway or Jimmy John's in the same category.  I probably go there at least once a week and the experience is consistent every time- Great food, high customer service and a very clean store!  I would highly recommend going to this restaurant if your looking for a quick sub with a great experience!"}
{"text":"So one of my co-workers took me here on Friday and I tried their Italian sandwich and I must say it was excellent. The bread was awesome, the meat was fresh and the lettuce and tomatoes (nice, red and fully ripe) were extremely crisp. The staff was very friendly and laid back and they even knew my co-worker by name.  I looked around and the place was spotless.  Unlike other sandwich shops, this place even cuts their meat fresh. Best of all, these people are not cheap on their portion. Some places give you one slice of cheese and cut it into 4 slices to make it look like more, and do the same with the meat, luckily not here.  As of right now I will give this place a solid five stars. Great service, great sandwich, clean store, good location. No issues. I'll update my review if I stop here again."}
{"text":"I love the subs here and the customer service can't be beat. I used to work here before I left for the Marines and Gary always hooks me up when I come home. Great food and even better service will always keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The guy moved a little too fast making my sandwich. He talked so fast I had no idea what he asked me lol. He may have worked at Jimmy Johns freaky fast subs in his past life Lolol. But it was really clean and nice."}
{"text":"I have visited 2 times since the new owner took over and both times have been horrible. The first time I walked in to order and was told they had no bread left. No bread at a sub shop? How does that happen? The employees seemed happy that they ran out of bread. The second time I ordered a giant Italian on wheat and when I got home the bread was overcooked so much it was like eating a giant crouton sub. $12 in the garbage. Still haven't had any decent subs from them. Looks like I'll just have to go to capriottis that just opened up the street."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Clean restaurant.  The sandwich guys were quick, pleasant to speak to, and made great food.  The Little League World Series was on today, so they had it on both TVs.  No matter where you sit, you can easily see the TV.  The quality of the food is really good.  If you're used to Subway or Quiznos or Port of Subs... Jersey Mike's is an entirely new experience.  The Manager, Jamie, was incredibly helpful and really had his team on the ball.  Overall, my family and I really enjoyed going here.  This was our first time at a Jersey Mike's and thanks to our fab experience today, it certainly won't be the last."}
{"text":"Love Jersey Mike's Subs.  The staff is all super friendly.  Be sure to get your sub \"Mike's Way\"  which is no mayo or mustard - they use olive oil and a sweet red wine vinegar along with some oregano: it may sound strange but it is fabulous.  Each sub is custom made so they do back up when there are a few people.  It is also not the cheapest in town but, you aren't getting the Subway deli slices either.  You get fresh cut meat and it is very flavorful.  I think the \"mini\" is mis-named as it is plenty large for me.  Definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Excellent subs! They are a bit pricey but so very worth it! Jersey Mikes has ruined me for any other sub shop. The bread is fresh. The meats are great and plentiful. It's perfect when you like 15 pieces of bacon on your large BLT.  I can have my sub in half, for lunch and dinner. We love Jersey Mikes!"}
{"text":"I like the sandwiches here.  The philly steaks and philly chicken is a little low on meat but the others are great.  They cut the deli meats and cheese in front of you and you get a fresh sandwich.  The owner works there and will quickly engage you in conversation.  Unfortunately the topic is whatever is on the tv near the counter.  He talks politics and leaves no question to where he stands.  Customers don't necessarily agree with these but ultimately that shouldn't be an issue and he needs to be more aware of topics.  Other employees are not the friendliest bunch.  One guy that works the counter always kind of tosses by card back to me on the counter instead of handing it to me.  Maybe that is just a pet peeve of mine but it makes me hesitant to go in at times."}
{"text":"Went there this afternoon after a long day, they over charged us by $9 ($29 for 1 regular and 2 kids) and wouldn't give us our money back or our receipt. Staff was not friendly and did a poor job with communicating with each other. Will go to port of subs or somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"My hubby is a big sub fan & Jersey Mike's is one of his favorites. We were in the area on Sunday & decided to have lunch here. We were warmly greeted by the employees & looked over the menu. Hubs chose #7 (turkey & provolone) giant size & I chose #6 (roast beef & provolone) mini size. We both chose white bread, he got all the fixins & I went the boring route with just lettuce & mustard. We both made our meals combos by adding chips & sodas. What I found awesome was that they support Susan G. Komen for the cure (breast cancer organization) & were selling pink cups for 70 cents more, with all proceeds going to their cause! Any how, the meats & cheeses are sliced fresh right in front of you & it makes their subs that much better. The bread is very delicious as well. Total for everything was less than $25, a lil on the pricey side but they blow Subway & other similar places out of the water! Plus, my hubby's sub was so huge that he made it into his dinner as well."}
{"text":"The Sasquatch making my sandwich was rude. The bread was dry and the sandwich sucked. Airport Jersey Mikes blows!"}
{"text":"Subs are always great but the service here is absolutely terrible. 2 employees stood in the back and refused to come help for almost 5 minutes. Completely unacceptable. Get a number 13 mikes way but do it at a different location."}
{"text":"I ordered a ruben the sandwich it was ok but i have had much better. What makes this place funny is that they try to be an authentic new jersey or new york deli . So they put their deli meats on display in a showcase fridge to try and show off the quality of there fresh meat but there meat distributer does not have any kind of reputation and they put \"watered ham\" on display. Really watered ham lol"}
{"text":"Friendly, food is always good, I have come here many times for lunch and the line moves quickly."}
{"text":"Run to a different vendor... Don't waste your money here.  Money spent on a Philly Cheesteak  is wasted.  Sandwich was not edible."}
{"text":"Ordered a number 56 and got something that was not a number 56 and that was raw.  I would not recommend going to this place ever."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sub place...their italian sub reminds me how they make it back home (Chicago). Simple, clean ingredients , fresh meat an cheeses and great bread.   If you're complaining about wanting less oil/vinegar then speak up. I actually ask for extra. Same goes for wanting less/more of other toppings.   Staff is fast and friendly and I will always choose this place before any other of given the choice."}
{"text":"This was my first and last time. Like the other post I came in hungry and left broke and still hungry. Almost $12.00 for a medium sandwich and a large drink.  The sandwich and the drink were both small.  If not for the toppings I would have thought I purchased a \"wish sandwich \" no thanks I will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT sandwiches and super friendly people.  All freshly carved meats.  Loved the oil and vinegar dressing on the sandwich.  Excellent value for the money compared to Quiznos or places like that and way better quality.  Would definitely go back again for lunch."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience with the workers back in November and vowed to never go back. Definitely not a good idea to hire jerks. Food is decent, service is some of the worst ever. And like a lot of the others on this list, I don't usually take the time to write a bad review, esp 5 months after but they were terrible. So there's that."}
{"text":"Everytime i go eat here it's a great day for me  Food is great  Workers are friendly If you are hungry you are at the place for it"}
{"text":"Every time I'm wanting a sandwich I always turn to Jersey Mike's to satisfy my cravings. Not only are their sandwiches fresh and delicious, but the staff at this location are also amazing! I am always welcomed with excitement from all of the employees and they actually make an effort to talk to their customers. They also give discounts to ASU discounts which is a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"My boss ordered a bunch of turkey subs, ham subs, and beef subs and I was addicted.  Took my boyfriend here (who was completely dedicated to ONLY getting his subs from Jimmy John's) and he is now converted!  He's always asking if we can go.  The staff here is really nice and welcoming.  They'll make you feel like you've been a regular for years as soon as you walk in the door.  Make sure no matter what, though...you always have to get your sub made \"MIKE'S WAY\"!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place a lot they cut the cheese and meats in front of you, i got the super sub (mikes way) and it was awesome. This is by far way better then subway. The only thing is i wish there was a little bit more choice in the veggies and bread, but hey it was still freakin good."}
{"text":"Chicken Parm disaster! A vendor of mine picked up lunch for me on his way to our meeting so I could eat before hand. I take my first bite, chicken was so over cooked I could't even bite through it. It had no cheese and had more tomato sauce than a jar of Prego. The meeting was about to start so I couldn't even take it back. It ruined my lunch & not to mention got sauce everywhere. If you have a craving for Jersey Mike's I suggest going to Subway. Same product for about half the price. Now, it you want a good sub, got to Firehouse Subs or Mr. Goodcents."}
{"text":"They make a great sandwich for a fast food chain, always fresh good bread and the meat and cheese is sliced right in front of you. The #13 is fantastic. So much better than Subway."}
{"text":"Good place to load up on the calories, if you're near UNCC. A frequent haunt of mine, back when I was a student at UNCC. Great hot subs, especially the philly cheesesteak, big kahuna, chicken parm and the chipotle sub. From among the cold subs, I'd pick the tuna and the original Italian. The staff is super helpful and they'll customize your order any way you want to, plus the TV's always tuned in to some sports channel too. In short, a place you can always go to have a filling lunch, be it a rushed run-through, or a leisurely meal. Ironically, I'm now in Jersey but I'm yet to find a kahuna sub as good as the one I used to have here.  Tip: If you're a UNCC student, show your student ID when you order, and they'll give you a student discount."}
{"text":"Quick service and good food. In my husband's words, they put the smack down on the subs. Located on C terminal."}
{"text":"We went to the one on Gilbert for lunch today, very disappointed. The sliced meat is no better than Jenni o and the service was rushed and unfriendly. I ordered a toasted pastrami reuben. I never saw them slice, toast or put on the fix-ens. A guy came from the back counter and had my sub wrapped in foil. I asked is there lettuce on it and he said ahhh no. I asked if he could put it on and some peppers. I got it home and i realized it had not been toasted it had been microwaved! With the bread, because the bread was soggy and there was no sign that it had been toasted. Very little meat and cheese. If you want to over pay for a soggy, nuked roll with a little meat and cheese..eat here. At home I put more lettuce on and toasted the roll, it fell apart horribly."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike subs are the best! When we come to Surprise we always make sure we eat there. Fresh meats and bread and great friendly service."}
{"text":"I was so glad when this Jersey Mike's location opened awhile back and apparently everyone else in this business park was as well.   The line is consistently long but the wait is never a problem.  They have plenty of friendly staff ready to serve up a great sandwich and get you on your way.  I like that the meat and cheese are sliced when you order and not ahead of time so it's always fresh.  The meat is also piled high and the toppings are consistently fresh!  Great place for a quick lunch and back to work.  Also, I have been known to stop in on the way home too cause they are open later as well.  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I had a very funny experience at Jersey Mike's on Val Vista.    When I walked in for lunch there was one couple placing their order in front of me.  There were two food prep guys behind the counter -- and two \"management\" looking guys doing something back there as well.  For some reason it was taking a long time for the people ahead of me to place their order and have it made etc.  So I stood there waiting -- taking stock of things -- and noticed one of the food prep guys was just standing there doing nothing.  And the minutes started passing by.....  But still -- there I was patiently waiting-- as one guy worked -- and the other food prep dood stood staring off into space -- with TWO management type guys not paying the least bit of attention to the counter.  After several more minutes no one had said a word to me -- even though Mr. Hands-In-His-Pocket and I had made eye contact a few times.  Then it started to feel like I was in some kind of sit-com or something.  As other groups of people came in and the counter area started to fill up -- Mr. I-Get-Paid-To-Stand-Here-Doing-Nothing would greet them and say things like: \"Someone will be with you soon\" etc.  That's when I started looking around for a Candid Camera Crew -- figuring someone was playing a practical joke on me.    : )  After another several minutes - and having still not been acknowledged and feeling a bit like Rodney Dangerfield - I decided to head elsewhere and had a good laugh about it on the way to my car (and have had fun typing out my weird experience there).  PS: If the people at Candid Camera have been trying to reach me for permission to use the footage -- please just message me here because I won't be going back to this location ever again....."}
{"text":"Came in today, and i haven't been to a jersey Mike's in forever. Had a terrible customer service experience at a car dealership before getting lunch, the staff here was super friendly and helped turn my mood around. They even gave a free cookie."}
{"text":"My Giant turkey sub  is always made just right....you guys are awesome! !! Always fast and super good sandwiches. ..."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Meat is sliced when preparing your sub sandwich. I ordered the Italian sub, had it Mike's way...delicious. Staff was really friendly and efficient. I grew up going to Wildwood New Jersey for vacation and these sandwiches brought back great memories."}
{"text":"I love some Jersey Mikes. Fresh bread, and meats, and very clean. #ifuxwitcha I recommend the 7 Turkey or 17 Cheese Steak."}
{"text":"If you like mostly bread in your sub, Jersey Mikes is defiantly the place for you. I went there a few times and both times I ordered the large sub, meatball marinara. When I got it both times the meatballs were overcooked and the bread overpowers the taste. Don't get me wrong the meatballs are decent size but when on the bread they look like marbles."}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes gets four stars from me ladies and gentlemen.  Stumbled on this place after Chipotle a block up the street had a line out the door. The staff at this location was great, they took their time and walked you through your options. Enjoyed the fresh cold cuts which are cut in front of you and the fresh sub roll."}
{"text":"The service started off okay, but by time I left here I was extremely irritated. I was greeted with a hello sir how are you today which was fine but after I ordered my sandwich it all changed. I receive my sandwich which was the wrong sandwich,And once I politely walk back up and told them it was wrong, everyone looked at each other and look back at me like I did something wrong. Not even two minutes later I received my sandwich and it's cold which is supposed to be a hot sub. I unwrap the sandwich and it has onions all over it. This sandwich does not come with onions and I am also allergic. I walk over to the cook and say excuse me I did not ask for onions I'm allergic. The cook doesn't say anything but look at me and look at the sandwich and snatches it out my hand and toss it in the trash. After another 10 minutes I finally get my sandwich and the cheese is not even melted on a sandwich like it normally is.At this point I did not even want to go back to the counter to asked for a refund because I did not want to deal with anyone's attitude they brought from home... I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and sandwiches are super yummy and fresh. #13 italian is the best. I stopped going to subway since this place opened."}
{"text":"Gotta order it Mikes way w/those red pepper. Very clean place and extremely friendly. I a big sandwich kind of guy and really think this is the best in town."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are fine, though the tuna has a bit too much mayo.  The biggest concern I had was the inflexibility of the staff on the kids menu.  I wanted a veggie sub for my son with the kids meal, but they said I could only have the ham, turkey, or salami even though the veggie is the same if you take off the meat.  This isn't my first such experience at a Jersey Mikes and it is agitating every time."}
{"text":"This location has poor customer service. We placed an order it was wrong twice when checked in the store.  We ordered 1 chicken cheesesteak and 1 regular cheesesteak. On the third attempt we came home (15 min away) after being reassured it was correct only to find there were two beef cheesesteaks in the bag. We called and the guy that answered appeared not to understand what a chicken cheesesteak was, despite this being on the menu. My husband returned to the store with the order we received, only for the staff to inform him that one was chicken. I think everyone knows the difference between chicken and beef. Needless to say we will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Repeat customer here. Friendly, accommodating to my food allergy, and super fast, Jersey Mike's always exceeds my expectations in service.   The food itself is consistent in quality and taste and I feel it is a good value.   TIP: they have a bigger menu than what is posted on the board.  They also have online ordering which is easy-to-use!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for a sub in the area. #13 is my favorite and the pepper relish is amazing! You have to request it on your sub."}
{"text":"For fast food at an airport I thought it was quick and tasty and fresh!  Most time the food at the airport is prepared earlier in the day and hardly ever fresh."}
{"text":"Had coupons I love the food but could use more choices in toppings otherwise fresh but a little expensive"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Jersey Mike's Ive been too.  I have been eating subs here ever since they opened the location.  What sets this chain sub shop apart is there employees.  The team assembled that runs the place  is top notch.  They don't seem to have a high turnover which creates consistency and quality!  I especially love the fact that they can scan a coupon bar code on your iPhone or iPad in lieu of bringing the coupon in!  This place will always get my business over other chain sub shops!"}
{"text":"I have never seen my husband so mad before and he is a laid back guy. He walked in three employees standing behind the counter. He was asked multiple times what kind of bread he wanted. They made his hot sandwhich and left it on the counter for over 15 min getting cold while phone orders came in after he placed his order, and thier sandwiches were being made while his sat there getting cold. He asked several times if he could just get his sandwiches or his money back. It took him over 30 minutes to get his order of 2 sandwiches  This place was so unorganized, and rude. We will NEVER return to this location."}
{"text":"Sooo much better than Subway in terms of cleanliness, friendliness and most importantly food quality and taste.  (Plus they didn't hire a psychopath raping child molester as their spokesperson as Subway did.)     I got the Regular Original Italian Sub free from a coupon Jersey Mike's sent in the mail.  Frankly I wouldn't have known the place was here or tried the sub without that coupon.  The sub was quite plentifully stuffed and everything was really fresh and delicious.  The staff was great too - friendly, helping regarding toppings and cookie selection (which I didn't try).  What struck me most was the freshness of the ingredients in the sub.  I ate half last night two hours after I bought it and the other half today.  Despite the dressings, it held up well!  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I'm frugal so wish it had been $5 - if I'd been paying in the first place  :  ).  I believe it's normal price was $7.99.  Loved it and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Not impressed!  Subway is better. Not really impressed with the service, especially! If you do decide to eat here and have a child with you, remember to tell them you want your kids meal free, as advertised in the window, this summer. They won't remind you..."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, roast beef is fresh roasted medium and delicious. These guys are always friendly and make me feel welcome. I eat here twice or so a week for lunch. Always the best."}
{"text":"I ordered online paid $52.78 came in and it was not ready they didn't even have the order to make the sandwich they didn't even apologize they didn't even offer to make it right they just told me to get in line with everybody else and make an order they said they were so busy tonight they ran out of bread this is unbelievably the third time I have come to this location and they have ran out of bread I drove past five sandwich shops to get here I will never go there again and I will tell anybody I know not to ever go here again poorly run restaurant when you have a sandwich shop on every corner and you have that many choices you expect them to have a betters service level especially since they are on the higher end of pricing for sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic Jersey Mikes with fantastic service! The staff moved the long line extremely quickly and catered too us after we had our food!   I will definitely be coming back, and recommend this location to others."}
{"text":"The staff is very attentive,  and welcoming.  The sandwiches are always so yummy. I always get tuna, and it always tastes fresh."}
{"text":"Went to Jersey Mike's with a friend and ordered sandwiches. They took a little longer than usual for only one other customer besides ourselves and messed up our orders. I called back to inform them and the defensive worker stated she did the order as stated. Said my friend said all the way and he never does because it includes onions and peppers and he hates both. I ordered wheat and received white. Both sandwiches were dry yet she says she put oil and vinegar on both. Then pauses and says she will talk to her manager and I can call back after 10 minutes not apologetic at all. She could've offered to take my number as opposed to inconvenience me anymore. I will not but will write a few reviews to warn you guys."}
{"text":"Very surprised to see how clean this place!  Food is always great at many locations but I must say very impressed with the cleanliness here."}
{"text":"Worst subs ever!  The \"famous roast beef and provolone\" had paper thin cheese and only 5 slices of really thin roast beef.  Too much veggies and not enough meat. For the cost of the sub I could have bought a pound of good roast beef at a deli.  Big Kahuna Cheesesteak tasted \"off\" and not worth the money.  Tried to call the manager/owner and was told they were too busy to come to the phone. Really - too busy to take a call from a customer - never again!!"}
{"text":"I wouldhave to agree with Charlette. For how much you have to pay here its not worth it. When your in a competitive market like sub sandwhiches you would think if your going to charge more, you would offer more. Not here. You get about half the vegetables to choose from and cant even get a footlong. 15\" is a little to much, but when you got half of the fixings I guess it ranks out to be about the same. They need to change there prices to reflect the market. There trying to get more for less. Thats not going to work with me. Good luck."}
{"text":"I really like this place.. its close to my house but I had never tried it. Glad I did!"}
{"text":"Great Place, good food and the staff is great too.. Friendly, fast, and the prices are affordable"}
{"text":"First off when we walked in there was no one else in there on a Sunday afternoon should've tipped me off..my son and I were not that hungry so I ordered two kids size sandwiches and I understand I ordered different than what was on the kids menu but why would I pay $16 for two .. It would've been cheaper to order one sandwich and split it!! Also the employees could've informed me as well before making the sandwiches and when I asked how much those two were together they couldn't give me a price... Size the fact of her three employees and their standing around and no other customers the bread was to our vinegar made it real soggy real quick I've never had that problem at any other sub shop"}
{"text":"This place recently re opened. I love their beef sandwiches, but please please PLEASE starting cooking your beef better! Before it used to be all red and juicy and moist, like the perfect beef which set you apart to all other places, now its barely pink, overcooked and sometimes dry! I love you guys and how you used to cook it, but cook the beef for less time!"}
{"text":"One just opened up by my house and they sent a free sub coupon to the neighborhood houses. I have heard great things about this place, so I was excited for the free sub, but it turned out to be nothing special.  I went with the Italian sub and for \"fast food\" sub shops, I would prefer Quizno's subs better.  I actually went back to give it another try just to make sure that it wasn't a fluke the first time, but one thing that really turned me off was the pricing. I consider Quiznos a bit more pricey than Subway (it is hard to beat $5 for a footlong), and Jersey Mikes was quite expensive for the sub space.  Overall, I would suggest Jersey Mikes if you are looking for a decent sub."}
{"text":"Horrible! Ordered a chicken, bacon ranch hot sub and not only was there barely any meat there was a lack in flavor as well. Hardly any lettuce and the wheat bread was mushy. Not worth the money for sure! What a waste! This is a definite fail and to think Jimmy John's was right down the way."}
{"text":"So happy Jersey Mikes now in Surprise! They have the best! More meat, good service too. Now we will know where to eat! So happy!"}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience there. The food was good, but the service wasn't great. The staff seemed very unorganized and when I got to the register to pay 2 of my 3 subs were ready. I was told to wait just a moment while the 3rd was finished. After 5 mins I asked if it was done and was told to wait another few mins. Now after 10 mins of waiting and seeing other customers eating the same sandwich I had order I inquired again. This time the employee went and checked and they hadn't even started making mine. So at this point I had to sit and wait another 5 mins for my hot sub to be prepared all the while the manager who was aware of the situation didn't offer an apology, a free drink or a refund. Since my family was at home waiting for their subs it made it that much more frustrating."}
{"text":"This place is awesome - the Philly cheesesteak is really good that I ordered it each of the two times I went there while I was in Vegas.  I was staying at the Hard Rock Hotel and a friend suggested checking this place out which is about a 15 to 20 minute walk away.  One of the guys behind the counter was cool and recommended the Big Kahuna Philly which was really good.  It comes with extra cheese but I had them keep it to the normal level of cheesiness.  Another thing is that you can get a punch card where you buy 12 full size subs (or, 24 halves) and get one full size free or buy 6 full size and get a half size free.  I definitely plan to bring that card back with me on my next trip to Vegas as I need 3 more full subs for a free half (shouldn't be a problem).  I went there with a friend and he had the Reuben which was also really good.  The price is fair for what you get - about $6 for a half and $11 for a full size.  I'd definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome crew! Immediately greeted by Randi and the crew carried on conversation with me down the line. As busy as they were, I had my sub in no time!"}
{"text":"This Jersey Mike's location uses a dirty rag to wipe off the food counter where they place the subs before asking for extras  like lettuce etc. I have not seen this practice at any other Jersey Mike's and I was ignored when I asked them to stop.  I would avoid this store and visit another location."}
{"text":"This location is clean and the staff is kind.  The sub was yummy, I ordered a turkey with bacon and avocado.  The day we went there happened to be a customer from Jersey at one of the tables yelling as loud as he could about sports."}
{"text":"If you like subs, you really should try this place.  They have two types of bread (white and wheat) so the selection isn't as varied as Subway but it's very fresh and tasty.  It has a real deli feel to it and they have arranged it so there is a meat and cheese case next to a toppings case.  The staff at this location is very friendly.  I've been at the Happy Valley location three times now and each time the place was extremely clean and the staff was energetic and warm. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday to feast on a Philly cheesesteak; had it with the onions and peppers on white bread.It was phenomenal! So much that I spent the whole weekend dreaming about it. And so I convinced my co-workers we needed to eat here for lunch the following Monday.  I ordered the Philly again on white bread w/ onions and peppers, but this time w/ chicken as the filling. Wow! It was delicious! The bread was not soggy. And both sandwiches were flavorful. It was well worth the $7 plus change spent."}
{"text":"I have been to jersey mikes before but in another state. I can't lie this wasn't my first choice for lunch but my other choice was packed.   The place was clean and well kept and the staff was friendly and inviting. There was seating but not a ton which I suppose is part of the business design.   The subs were good but not a ton of choices. I got an Italian style sub while my wife got the chipotle philly steak sub. Both subs were good but the price was too high once you added a drink and chips. Our two sub combos along with a kids menu option for my boy was $26.00.   All I'm saying is that I could go to subway and get the same thing for 10 bucks less, along with chemicals is my bread ha!!!  I'm undecided if I will return or not."}
{"text":"Very clean, fresh, consistent and friendly service!  Can get a little busy at lunchtime so plan ahead. Hard to beat their lunch combo special on Tuesdays or Thursday's ( can't remember which day)."}
{"text":"Great place! Watch them slice the meat and cheese for your sandwich then load it up the way you want. If you like a little zing, add some CPR (chili pepper relish) to your sandwich. Delicious! I love their cold sub's, but I have tried one of their cheese steak a which was ok. I literally salivate just thinking about their original with the CPR. Great sandwiches, friendly staff, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great place. The number 13 is the best sandwich anywhere.   The sugar cookies, when not overcooked, are fantastic. Nice staff and good service."}
{"text":"I love Mike- we are good friends and I love his subs. But I am very flustered because the same lady who makes the sandwiches there asks me what I want on my sandwich 1093839378438 times before she remembers it and gets it right after about an hour."}
{"text":"Great cold subs, but I will take Penn station over this any day!"}
{"text":"Tried this again last night before i flew back to denver...was told they only had wheat bread...was not a shock for this location they need a new owner who will use the Jersey Mikes name worthwhile"}
{"text":"I dont know what it is but there is something that I cant stand about there sandwiches it leaves and awful taste in my mouth.  I think it may be something in the bread."}
{"text":"This is obviously a chain and I love the food here but I love coming to this location because the guys are so friendly, courteous, and provide excellent service! 5 stars for the guys behind the counter!"}
{"text":"Love the subs, not so much the customer service. Last time I was in they got my bread choice mixed up and forgot my sauce on the side! Then when I asked for my sauce, the manager made it seem as if I was asking him to remake the entire order. Sorry for correcting your mistake? I guess that's what happens when you let someone young run a place like this. Next time we will go to the arrowhead location"}
{"text":"Way too expensive for the quality. $8 just got me a sub...no chips no drink! The staff was friendly though! So...if you don't mind paying that much for a mediocre sub."}
{"text":"This location always slacks on meats and cheeses.. This has happened the last 4 out of 5 times I visited this location. The deli items are sliced extremely thin, and load on the lettuce to make it look better. You would expect more for the price. All honesty, you are better off going somewhere else or a different location."}
{"text":"by far my favorite place to have a quick lunch in the valley. I don't typically go in during the lunch rush but I found myself in the heart of one today, and I think the ladies working deserve some recognition for their speedy sandwich making. The line was huge and with just 3 staff members my wait time was under 10 minutes. Even with the rush the usual top quality of my sandwich wasn't sacrificed! I love this sandwich shop, the employees are kind, professional and quick. The store is clean, and well kept, and the sandwiches are always delicious. Thank you Jersey Mike's crew for providing such an Awesome place tograb a quick, tasty bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Had to make a Yelp account just to show how unacceptable the customer service here was. I always go to Firehouse or Harris Teeter when I want a sub, and now I know why. I figured I'd give Jersey Mikes a shot since I received a really good coupon: $2 for any Regular sub. When I get to the register and gave my coupon to the cashier, he then said my total for just the sub was like $7 (which is also ridiculous). I showed him that the coupon says $2 and he said that it printed wrong, it should say \"$2 off\" and he would not honor the face value of the coupon. So, apparently someone on Jersey Mike's end made a printing mistake with the coupon, and all the customers are forced to pay the price. Wow, some strategy that is!  This will be the last time I go to Jersey Mikes."}
{"text":"I am a very avid fan of Jersey Mikes subs. Without a doubt every time I go in to this restaurant I'm never disappointed by the service received. Great food and great people behind the counter make for an amazing experience. Not to mention last time I was there I received a free brownie just to make my day. Selfless things like this are what make me come back again and again."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sub shop in town. I get pretty easily grossed out by lunch meat... Especially turkey and they have, hands down, the best turkey I have ever tasted. Fresh sliced meat, cheese, and bread to order and always a friendly helpful staff.  I've made it a Christmas eve. tradition to include a Jersey Mikes sub tray on the menu! Everyone expects it now!!!"}
{"text":"Twice I have shown up before 8:30 pm and the two people working are sweeping and breaking down the grill.  This time they were out of white bread.  Horrible attitudes too!  If the sign is open so is everything!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are always tasty and the staff is very nice. The breads and meats are always fresh and one of the better sandwich places I've been too. This location is always clean as well. I really enjoy their cookies and brownies too."}
{"text":"My husband and I have lunch at this particular Jersey Mike's location, at least once a week,  as the meal and service are simply outstanding! We just moved to the area and the same guy (I'm a jerk, I don't know his name ~ although, I can only assume that he's the owner/operator as he's there every single time we've frequented the establishment) takes the time to acknowledge the fact that he remembers us (which is rather nice and unexpected) even when there are several people in line. As far as the sandwich....oy vey! Just fantastic! Normally, I am rather fussy about what I like and what I don't like, but this guy converted me. The #8 Club Sub Mike's Way is sheer perfection! Happiness served daily."}
{"text":"Love Jersey Mikes subs! We usually eat at the Whittier location, Norwalk and Beverly. These are great samiches and the price is not bad. Ask for your samich Mikes way, you will love it!"}
{"text":"The staff was extremely friendly, and the sub was Delicious!!! There wasn't a long line, even though it was lunchtime, I was in and out in less than 7 minutes. Great sub shop!"}
{"text":"Wow I love the sandwiches here.  I just got the turkey hoagie and it was delicious!  Definitely felt like the east coast. :)  It's neat that the meats are in a deli counter and are sliced fresh to order.  I also just noticed a yelp review that you can get a free sandwich on your birthday.  Free stuff is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Never had a problem with this store before. Was in a real hurry today so I ordered online an hour before I needed the sandwiches. Online says order ready at 12:05. Show up 20 minutes before and they haven't even started my order. I let them know I need them right away they tell me they can get it done in 10 minutes. I sit there for the next 15 minutes while they make everybody else a sandwich in line ahead of me. Couldn't understand what was going on had to ask 3 to 4 times why they weren't starting my order. All he kept telling me it was a very busy and they only had three people there. I don't understand the point of online ordering if they don't even start your order when they receive it. I would've been better off just ordering when I walked in. People that showed up  after me we're getting their orders done before me. I'll never be back!! terrible store terrible service!! Do yourself a favor and find another store!"}
{"text":"Great place. Excited one opened near my home. But my husband got the Parm, it was disappointing. The quality is disgusting, especially compared to everything else being good. And for that price the chicken needs it's game stepped up. The chicken tasted like a fake frozen heated up Chicken tender that's all hard and slimey. Come on guys, everything else is good. Get to work on this. Or I will take action like I've had to on many other places. Let's make all food great!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and I do enjoy it. Not as much as my mother does but I can eat it every once and awhile. I like getting the Club Sub the most but hold the mayo please.  The whole \"Mike's Way\" concept is nice but I think they put way too much vinegar and oil. I just always have to remind myself to say easy on the oil and vinegar please. The bread is also very tasty and I do like that they slice it in front of you! Very fresh :)  The pricing is...meh...I wish they were 3-4 dollars cheaper and I also wish they had COKE and not PEPSI products bleh!"}
{"text":"I'm always in the mood for a good sandwich, so I stopped by Mike's.  As anxious as I was, I was STUNNED by the sky-high prices for what you get.  I mean, how good can a sandwich be to command 30% over market value, and 30% under volume consumed?    The bun was 70% of the presentation, and although the buns are worthy and important, they should be 20%.  The meat and cheese should be at least 50% of the value for the sandwich.  Any good consumer knows that.  Here we go, with no need to elaborate---  The outcome of the big 3:  Service:   This part was average, and it's what you would expect at a busy sandwich shop.  We were 3rd in line, and it was 7 minutes before we walked out the door.  Taste:  I liked the taste, although I was expecting SO MUCH MORE because of the hype that they put into their t.v. commercials.  After hearing the commercial, I expected them to be the most-perfect sub, just like they said.  The bun is 70% of the sub, and while soft and tasty, should've been 20% of the sub.    It was just O.K., and it's fine for a quick bite at a sub shop.  Don't expect the meat and cheese to overpower the taste, since it's such a meager and marginal portion of the entire sub.  Price:  Welcome to the 'horrendous part' of the entire ordeal.  I have no problem paying $5 for a delicious sub.  One of the market leaders has been doing $5 subs for years, and I've often wondered why any other competitors that want to be market leaders haven't driven the price down AT ALL.  I expect that they don't want to compete in an American workplace, that is expected to be DRIVEN BY PRICE.  I would even give $10 for the most fantastic sub, like the ones that New Yorkers RAVE about the subs in New York.  Since this is a New Jersey import, I have HUGE problems paying $9 to walk out with an average sub + fixin's.  I'd have no problem unless, of course, Chandler had a average, upper-class wage compared to New Jersey's upper-class wage.  You'll notice that they are NOT the same, and you'll find that they are VASTLY different.  If this sub would've 'rocked my world', then it's totally worth a $10 fee to escape with their fixin's.  As it was, I was left with a sub-standard sub (less than 12\") and with normal, wholesome, expected, and anti-climatic fixin's.  A big let-down from what their commercials INSIST are the best.  Summary: This shop is overpriced, and they don't get it.  They EXPECT that this is what you SHOULD pay for a 'premium' sub.  The trouble is, that Chandler is NOT Scottsdale, New York, nor New Jersey, and they haven't factored in the DESIRED sub shop that should be operating in a college community.  (we don't need more Scottsdale-type pricing, just college-kid pricing with college-kid type portions).    I doubt that the owners will agree, and also, please expect that the owners will maintain that they are \"...doing a good thing...\" for the residents of the area.  Please disregard their fantasy leanings, since they don't understand the undergraduate population.  As far as stereotypes coming out of New Jersey, I'm also sure that these owners, just like the aggressive, post-WW2 unions, would ACTIVELY seek to prevent you from hearing what I've said about their food in this article.  I'm also convinced that they would also ADAMANTLY deny any affiliation with union henchmen.  Viva la America!"}
{"text":"Heaven.  Literally....  Im a sammich snob.. I want my bread and my meat to taste great.. not one or the other.  Up untill the other day, I was a panera bread LOVER.   They have the best bread EVER. But, I have to say Im reformed and totally going full hog with Jersey Mikes.  I had the Chicago club, spectacular! My wife had the cali club with guacamole and I finished..ok..STOLE the other half of her sammie after I inhaled mine.   Food this good tends to be eaten in a rather quick fashion, so it needs to have alot of flavor due to speed at which its being consumed so you can actually taste it.  Wow, we cant wait to go back and try the others cause I totally was about to trip a bitch and steal her GIANT pastrami on Rye.. lol  The only downside is that I didnt get asked if I wanted chips or fruit with my meal so I got stuck with crinkle chips..EWW!  But the other half got fruit and that shit was soooo sweet and delicious! Didnt taste like colorful water, the pinapple, melon and strawberrys were hella juicy and tasty..   The other down side.. it aint cheap. lol  22 bux for the both of us so do the math.   But we will be back, maybe to grab a sammie on the way to bonnie springs.. or a family hike in Red Rock when its not africa hot outside lol"}
{"text":"Will and the staff at this place are so kind and serve with a smile.  Love the food and the service at this location!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing to have to write this review, I heard great things about this place until I went in and witnessed the \"manager\" of the store yelling at one of his employees in front of about 5 customers. I know hes the manager cause I asked an employee for his name and the managers number. I couldn't believe that a \"Manager\" would treat one of his employees with such disrespect. After he yelled at this poor guy in front of everyone and embarrassed him, he stormed off to the back of the store hitting and throwing things with later a door slam. Meanwhile there was a big line with customers waiting to get helped. The food was good but its a damn shame that the rude a$$hole manager had to ruin this for me and other customers in there. I don't know about you, but I would NEVER go back and do business with a person who treats his employees like crap."}
{"text":"Horrible service, called in order and messed it up quite badly and I will suggest my work gets catering from somewhere else and I for sure will not order here again since they messed my order up 3 times."}
{"text":"Unlike other jersey mikes in Charlotte, this one will charge extra for cheese. No joke. You'll end up paying like $10 for a regular tuna or turkey or anthill with cheese. Don't bring your business to a greedy place like this. I literally drive all the way to the jersey mikes in steel creek south tryon just to prove I won't give a greedy place my money. It cost more in gas but screw them"}
{"text":"Food - So good! Mike's way is the best way.  Service - Great. They aren't your typical sandwich shop. They aren't just waiting for you to stop talking so they can say \"toasted?\" and they don't put lettuce on your sandwich with a shovel. Its not freaky fast service but it is fast."}
{"text":"Sandwich was okay. Ordered #9 I only got turkey, no roast beef. They also forgot my bacon and the bread was hard but other than that it tasted okay"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite sub place on green street! If you're on campus at U of I, it's worth the walk over.   Sandwiches are decent sized. White bread or wheat bread. Both are good. Meat is freshly sliced. Veggies always fresh. Order you sub Mike's Way--it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  I have tried several of their subs and although they are all delicious the Chipolte Cheese Steak (it's the # 43) is my favorite!  It is the MOST DELICIOUS sub I have ever had!!!  The bread is always soft and fresh, it is extremely filling because it's stuffed full of steak, peppers, and cheese!!!!  To make it absolutely the BEST sub ever have them add some of the little red chili's to it (I think they call it chili relish)....OMG!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bread is hard because they leave it out. Little expensive for a sandwich that is smaller than at subway. Taste is good but bread the last 2 times is hard. So that takes away the good taste."}
{"text":"This is exactly what a Jersey sub should taste like, just wish they had pork roll on the menu as some of the other Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Never heard of it before so decided to give it a try when i was having an oil change at Mr.Tire. Terrible subs... not to mention their attitude and efficiency. It was only me and another customer at the store and it took them about 5 minutes to start my order, and then they switched to another staff to finish my order, and then another 2 minutes to get the price right (I ordered a mini and they charged for a regular...)  The subs are the worst I've had in quite a long time. The red wine, which is their special recipe, makes the bread damp and almost inedible. I ordered a cold tuna and the amount of tuna is virtually half of what I got at Subway.  Dont even wanna say anything more. That's it. Dreadful."}
{"text":"Just not impressed. I found the quality of their subs left something to be desired, especially for the price.  They aren't bad but there are better options in the area. Staff was not the best either..  made it seem like we were almost an inconvenience to them. Maybe just a bad day but most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is a Franchise based out of Point Pleasant, New Jersey that just opened in Tempe. I grew up eating at Mike's every summer when my family would go to the Jersey Shore for the month of August. Let me tell you this is the quintessential sub!   The meat is finely sliced right when you order it, and piled high. The vegetables, lettuce, tomato & onions are fresh. That's right there isn't a billion ingredients to muck up the taste! The oil & red wine vinegar mix is AMAZING! With the special blend of spices they add to it...OH MY GOD so good! The bread is just perfect! Baked fresh daily this bread is soft, and absorbs the juices perfectly.  Once again this is the perfect sub. I am so glad they are now open in Arizona. If you are not sure what to get try the #13 The Original Italian, it is the best tasting in the bunch!"}
{"text":"2 stars for subs only! Service is AWFUL! BEWARE: the people who work here will not actually listen to your order and will completely screw it up and this has happened every single time I've been in. If it wasn't for the #13 Mike's Way I would never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Ordered online for pickup, got there 8 mins after they were supposed to have been done, hadn't even started on them. Counter looked as though it wasn't wiped down all day. Used gloves thrown on floor all over the kitchen area. Then younger employee sent to Wal mart to get loaf of bread to use on the next sandwiches. Sandwiches tasted ok besides the gallon of oil that they were drenched in which lead to my wife and I both having unenjoyable experiences the next day. Will not be going again."}
{"text":"Well, I loved Jersey Mikes up until now!  They have reopened under new management and completely new staff.  While telling the employee what we wanted on our sandwiches, looking at the tomatoes they were moldy.  I wish I could have taken a picture.  How can you slice a bunch of tomatoes and not notice the mold!!  When we got home to eat our sandwiches the bread was hard, not fresh.  Employees are not as friendly as the other group.  We will give them another try. I really hope this isn't the end of Jersey Mikes for me."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been eating here off and on for a few years and I'm never disappointed. Had the Chicken Philly sub today and it was excellent. The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Flawless subs straight out of New Jersey. Ask for miles way it is the best way to go. Jersey Mikes blows Subway out of the water"}
{"text":"My jersey mikes of choice! Great service and great food! I love that this place is clean too. I go out of my way to go to this specific jersey mikes!"}
{"text":"I was happy to have my usual, very friendly staff! Could have been a bit cleaner, but overall what you would expect for fast food."}
{"text":"Just a little tip for people thinking Jersey Mike's is fast food. IT IS NOT;although they try to get orders out fast, Jersey Mike's is a deli. All hot subs are cooked to order and all cold subs are sliced. All the toppings are sliced. Yes that's right sliced, lettuce, tomatoes, ....etc. nothing is pre-prep."}
{"text":"Look, honestly the place has nice subs. Perhaps the sub itself can go toe-to-toe with that of Subway. The menu, however, needs to be expanded. There are a limited amount of subs available, and even though you can create your own the selection is still limited. I hate to turn this review into a \"Jersey Mikes vs Subway\" but I can't help it! I'd (3) things about Jersey Mikes stands out to me in comparison to Subway: your choice of cold wraps, the hot subs don't fall apart right away, and the subs are larger (and accommodate more items).  The joint itself is nothing special, although having three TVs can definitely work for some people.  NOTE TO OWNER(S): Expand your menu and we can be friends."}
{"text":"I want to start this review by saying Jersey Mike's is my favorite sub chain in the area. However, this location gives the chain a bad name.    Where to start...When you walk in, most of the tables are dirty which makes it hard to find somewhere to \"enjoy\" your sandwich. Then once you walk to order your sandwich, you are not even greeted by the three workers behind the counter. Instead they would rather b.s. with each other than give you the time of the day.  Once they noticed me, they looked annoyed that I am even there.    I ordered my normal, the Italian, which is generally delicious when done Mike's way.  However once again this is not the case. The meat was cut well but that's pretty much impossible to mess up. When it came to the toppings it was a different story.  Its almost as if they opened a bottle of oil and put the entire thing on my sandwich. When she wrapped up my sandwich (even though I said for here) I couldn't even hold it without it pretty much slipping out of my hand. It was AWFUL.    I generally don't write bad reviews, but I needed to let others know truly how bad this experience was. If I could put 0 stars I would have done so."}
{"text":"New spot 2 miles from home. Same great food same great staff and service.  Manager Anthony and his team rock the JM Sub.  We'll be back tomorrow...maybe later today."}
{"text":"About the same as all other locations, was a little ticked that meatballs for the 2 kids was 13 bucks for 2 meatballs.  Also when we were there the fountain drink machine was tore up, so that was a turn off.  Two reg subs without drinks shouldn't cost 30 bucks.  Not worth the value."}
{"text":"Absolute worst sandwich place o have ever been to. They drench the sandwich in oil and vinegar and make the bread soggy. I told them, after witnessing the \"Mikes style\", that I did not want mine made that way. And he still drenched my sandwich. It was soggy and disgusting."}
{"text":"Fast, polite, professional but funny group of people.  Makes for a fun lunch hour.  Their quality ingredients stand out at first bite.  I hit this spot about once a week because you can get any sandwich as a wrap or a salad....and it still tastes just as good.  Highly recommend you try this place out.  Jersey Mikes puts Subway, Blimpies and Schlotzkey to shame in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"Yeah 5 stars.  That is for best in this category.  I love this location.  They closed the one that was on Baseline and close to where I live but this isn't too far.    The Rivulon store is near a lot of auto dealers so it can get busy.  If you like subs made with real meat and REAL cheese then this is your place.  It is not the cheapest place to get a sub but it is well worth it.    Three favorites are #2 (my fav - Ham Cappacoulo and Cheese.  Wife likes the #3 Ham and Cheese. Parents both love the #13 Original Italian.    Another favorite (used to be off menu is the #12) Cancro Special.    We like it Mike's way.  But be careful, if you don't like onions you will be picking them off...so let them know exactly what you want.  Service Great service.  You can tell when someone is new.  It really slows own the line.  They have a young man and a young lady there that really crank out the subs.  (Unfortunately I can't remember their names..and we ask every time)  One Tip Their service is top notch.  We have sometimes had to point out that (usually after a rush) that we would prefer a new batch of tomatoes or a new batch of lettuce.  I am sure that was annoying to them.  But never once did anybody complained and I always got a fresh tray of veggies.    If you are looking for a sub...I do not know why you would not go to Jersey Mikes.  Subway and Jimmy Johns are not even in the same league."}
{"text":"When i went in the first time it was brand new.  it was ok i have walked in three other times and the way i walked in i walk right out the place is kind of dirty, always long waiting time in line and the table where they have the toppings to choose veggies is always dirty"}
{"text":"So happy about JM Subs opening by where I live. It's right by Dickie's and Little Caesar's.  Philly Cheese on delicious white bread. Yum!"}
{"text":"Just left this establishment....got a mini sub and the girl with the \"M\" tattoo (scorpio) tried to charge me extra...I think she tried to automatically add gratuity...Thieves in this place....don't buy there!!!"}
{"text":"We checked out Jersey Mike's last weekend and it was a pleasant experience.  We sat outside, of course what's not to like with this Phoenix weather right?  Nice crew with lots of enthusiasm in there.  I would say that you would receive a quality  lunch in a family atmosphere here.  Good vibe."}
{"text":"Ever since jersey mikes I will not eat subway! Reminds me of back home in New Jersey. I am a regular here so the people working there all know me, but it doesn't matter, they treat every customer like a regular! Great service, extremely clean place, great call ahead service as well. My personal favorite is the italian, but it doesn't matter what you get, its all great!"}
{"text":"It was quick I knew what I wanted and everything was worth ..the teamwork was great I'll be back again"}
{"text":"Never had a bad sandwich here and their service is great. I order online and only wish they did delivery!  I do their Chipotle Philly (chicken).. amazing!  They are a bit higher priced but you get what you pay for. This isn't cheap Subway ingredients nor lackluster service."}
{"text":"I have never written a review, but I have to comment about this restaurant.  The customer service was great, can't say enough about the workers.  I love subs, but when I was charged $9.18 for a 7 1/2 inch Italian sub, I was extremely surprised.  The fact that they cut the meat and cheese in front of you does not justify the price.  I rather go to an authentic Italian deli."}
{"text":"After driving by everyday for months I finally stopped in for a sub and was completely unimpressed. Even though the shop was nearly empty, the staff was indifferent and they forgot what I ordered multiple times.  The chicken parm sub I ordered was a hot bland mess. Instead of crispy breaded chicken inside, it had plain unseasoned chicken slices which was covered in cheese and a sauce one step away from ketchup. To top it all off the sub was microwaved, which made the inside insanely hot and turned to bread to rubber.  Maybe their regulars subs are better, but the next time I spend $10 on a sub and soda, it definitely won't be here."}
{"text":"The management is great! They love their customers and engage in conversation with them while making their food. They're awesome and the food is really good too."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Outstanding subs, fresh food and very full filling. A must go!"}
{"text":"I thought the service was great, cashier was helpful and nice. Decided to get a Philly cheesesteak. Made fresh, and cooked to order. Not complaining on the amount of time it took. Decently priced. However, adding mayo to it was a BAD idea. I gotta order to go and went home. By then the mayo was hot (obviously) and had a sour taste. Tried to wipe it off the sub, but there was just way to much on it. After a few bites I just couldn't take it anymore and threw it out. The mayo ruined everything. I think the subs shouldn't be wrapped in tin foil, like the one I got. It just takes the cold toppings put on there and turns them soggy and sour. Not good."}
{"text":"I told them exactly what I wanted & they made it for me.  Plus they are all about supporting the community. Thanks for such a successful fund raising night. The music program is one step closer to it's yearly goal. Can't wait to do it again. THANKS"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and the food was yummy, fast and fresh."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a good price. Went in not expecting much but the subs reminded me of philly sub shops back east. Everything was fresh and the store was spotless."}
{"text":"They had this place in downtown Iowa City and I went their in college probably twice a week and thought the meat and bread was great. Even last year I went back and I still thought it was top notch subbery.  I kinda think this place is just new and they don't quite have their act together yet, I just didn't feel it. I'm willing to try it again though."}
{"text":"Went to this location tonight. They acted like my son and I placing an order was a huge inconvenience and they didn't get our order correct. I won't go back. I visit the one in Mooresville almost every other day and their service has always been great."}
{"text":"I told my other half to call in a to-go order being that I was on my way home from work. He called 10 minutes before I got there. When I get there I see all the workers fucking around in the back and I tell them that I have a to-go order and the girl looks at me and says,\"oh we JUST got it.\" No. No the fuck you didn't. You were probably to busy fucking around and thought that \"they're gonna be late to pick up the order\" no bitch. I wasn't. Why is it that every time I go to this location the customer service is a piece of shit? The only reason why I keep coming back is because I like the sandwiches. As far as the employees, they suck. And that's being nice.   *excuse my language."}
{"text":"It's a sandwich shop. I always get 43. I will say this. The people in there are really friendly and they talk to you! Some people like to be left alone, but with all the crappy service you get at most fast food places, this is a breath of fresh air. If you want to keep yourself separated from the average, \"meh\", and self absorbed service...if you like sandwiches, this is the place for you! Thanks Jersey Mike's Subs at this location. Keep up the good work. And the delicious food. I'll keep coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.   Quick service,  very friendly staff,   newer place so it's extremely clean.  Parking is cramped.   Sign up for the email specials.  Great deals and they don't bombard you.  Make sure you try the #13 and add the cherry pepper relish.   You will love this place.   I just showed up for the second day in a row.  This place is just perfect!"}
{"text":"Waited more than 6 minutes. No one being helped in the restaurant. 2 people in front of me. They were never helped either.  Doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"Last night around 8pm I went to this store to get my friends some subs. I ordered four steak and cheese sandwiches to go. The two guys working were great! I didn't catch their names, but I wish I had! They were both tall with dark hair. They were so professional and kind! I also work at a sub-restaurant so I know how important ticket times are. I want to say I was in and out of the store in about five minutes. That's great for 4 subs. I was very pleased with my experience there. I didn't have any subs that night because I had already eaten, but I wish I ordered something! Food smelled so good! I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I frequent this Jersey Mikes on a weekly basis, if not more.  They have the subs in the area. Freshly sliced meats, delicious fresh bread, and fresh toppings.  Customer service is usually great too.  Their rewards program is excellent as well as their Ballantyne Corporate Card deal (free chip and drink with sub purchase).     There are plenty of sub places in the area but this Jersey Mikes tops them all in taste and value."}
{"text":"Prices are beyond extreme. One layer of each meat on a club sub, not good quality meat either. It's run of the mill boiled ham and that gelatinous ball of turkey that gets sliced up. Bread is good and it tastes fine but you can go to Harris Teeter or Publix and get something twice as filling with actual meat for over half the price. Seriously, shame on me for getting a $14 sub. Moment of insanity but I've learned my lesson. P.S. I see no need for them to have a TIP jar, or a TIP selection on the credit card terminal. That is rude, they aren't paid like wait staff as far as I know. At these prices they should be getting paid handsomely (but they probably aren't)."}
{"text":"Anytime I am flying in or out I stop by here for their.sandwiches.  food is top.quality and staff.is very friendly.  I just wish more airports had them."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and of course it was pretty busy but the employees were really friendly and were checking if everything was good. Ordered #54 the big Kahana cheese steak was alright pretty decent amount of meat but barely any mushrooms or  jalapeños."}
{"text":"Absolutely love these subs. Almost to a fault to be honest, but with a product as good as this for the price its at, you simply cannot go wrong! The staff is polite and quick and the subs are big and delicious making this place the best!"}
{"text":"So I'm writing this because I'm so tired of seeing this one emplyoee that doesn't care about what he does. Most of the employees at this location hustle except for the guy at cashier.   Sandwiches are usually good but today it was different. Noon today the one guy that is at cashier which wears a ton of makeup and I'm not being discriminating towards what he likes but it's that guy, made my order which totally did not care about what the sandwich was suppose to get and I was not about to say anything because I didn't want to even deal with the attitude he has. Yea it's a sandwich not a big deal but the rest of the employees and the work he puts out affect the business. Sorry but my business will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm from Delaware and have always missed having the amazing Italian subs that you just can't get in Arizona. But jersey Mikes comes so close. Their prosciutinni and capicola give the subs an authentic east coast taste. I love the # 13. Give this place a try if you miss the subs from back east."}
{"text":"Help! I am in parking HELL!  This parking lot is ridiculous shared with a Baja Fresh and a Starbucks so you can just imagine pure chaos.  So if you park your car safely and get in the door without being ran over its all downhill from there.  As soon as I walked through the door today I was greeted with a smile and a welcome from one of the employees that is cleaning in the seating area.  I've been to this location so many times and its funny because every time I am in there someone is cleaning or stocking the napkins therefore I can say this place is CLEAN!  So as I walk up to the counter to order, again I am greeted with a smile.  Man is it me or are these people frickin happy to work here?  Anyways, I order our sandwiches.  I ordered the turkey and provolone sub.  The \"mini\" is not all that mini...I would say its over 6 inches.  Totally enough and so filling.  The bread here is delish.  Its made fresh, kinda flaky and soft.  Definitely one of the best things about their sandwiches.  This time I tried their red pepper relish instead of mayo because I was told its FF-Fat Free and its a little spicy.  I like me some spicy and it gives it almost an Italian dressing taste.  Pretty yummy-I probably will order that the next time too.  The meat and cheese is sliced fresh in front of you and layered onto your sub.  They definitely do not skimp on ingredients I must say.  Huge plus.  So as I was checked out I had two guys getting the order together for me.  Over and beyond...do I feel so special.  hehe  I counted at least 5 employees working which is a lot considering how small this place is.  Guess they don't skimp on ingredients or customer service.  They are on top of everything.  I like it...I like it a lot!  On a side note I have had their chicken cheese steak which is delish.  So what I have noticed each time I have been here:  Someone is always cleaning the table areas (awesome) Everyone is always smiling and willing to help (nice break from work) Bread is freakin fresh as well as the ingredients (yummmay) and the parking still sucks. (Grrrrr)  minus 1 star  See ya next time."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a sub sandwich, all meat and cheeses are freshly cut in front of you (unlike Subway). Bread is always fresh and soft. A little on the spendy side but in my mind, you get what you pay for and if you want a FRESH sandwich this is the place to go. I'll be a returning customer for sure."}
{"text":"Super quick and delicious subs in 5 mins with amazing and super nice employees - honestly what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Stopped by on opening day. I haven't been to a Jersey Mike's in years and this was a good reintroduction.   I had the cheese steak and my daughter had the veggie wrap. We were both happy with the speed and freshness of our food. I was also impressed with variey on the menu.  The manager was also right there to help the staff with opening day questions and to enroll people quickly in the rewards program. A good Solis start and I am sure we will be back"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome-I LOVE jersey mikes and I'm so excited they replaced subway. Sandwiches are always consistent and fresh. Fortunate they are so close, unfortunate for my wallet. I eat here about 3-4 times a week for lunch. Employees are very nice as well"}
{"text":"Another decent sandwich shop in an area loaded with decent sandwich shops.   I've tried the veggie sub, it's not bad but they are extremely cheap with the cheese (2 or 3 slices on the two veggie subs I've had from there) but I like that they have whole wheat sub rolls and they have a tasty cherry pepper relish.  I tried a few bites of the Philly which I thought was delicious.  Husband loved their super sub.  I would make a point to stop here for the cheese steak but would go elsewhere for my cheese sub.  They charged us for two extra bags of chips the last time I was there which was annoying but not the end of the world, I'll make sure to check my receipt next time.    Their website needs improvement too, I didn't see all of the sandwich extras available until I tried to order online.  They want a credit card number to order online too - obnoxious."}
{"text":"Look it is Jersey Mike's and their staff is not going be winning JD Power awards for customer service but their sandwiches are good and so much better than Subway and meet a different craving for me than Jimmy Johns.  Whenever I call this location it is like they have never answered a phone before.  The employee always seems shocked I would want to phone in an order to pick up.  Often they have to ask someone else what to do or put me on hold to find someone to take my order or find a piece of paper to write my order down.  Maybe they should recruit from Jimmy Johns... My sandwich is often made correctly and ready when I get there to pick it up but the crew obviously deals with high attrition and so for now that is worth overlooking because the Club Sub is worth the less than seamless phone ordering process."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to try it for first time. Prices for a sub shop are a little higher side. Then when I went to pay with debt card my total showed up with the option to add 10% 15% or 20% tip. The only other option was other so I clicked it and it took me to a window I could put in the exact tip I wanted to leave. The cashier said something and I apologized and said I just was not use to having to tip at a sub shop. I clicked the 10% button feeling obligated but then Someone behind casher made a comment \"he did not tip did he\" I was embarrassed and angered at same time. What is it I tipped for? They rang up my order. So does that mean I need to tip anyone at a cash register. Grocery store, auto parts store?? Tipping someone to do job is bs and I will not be back!   To me is is a company issue for basically forcing you to tip and then a respect issue with what the employee said. Cost me 20 of a regular sub and a child's sub. Same thing at subway would have been less than half that.  Maybe I am out of date on who I am suppose to tip but they never came to table or did anything other that make a sandwich. I got my own drink."}
{"text":"This review is not about the food or service, both are tops, but i have to write about the cold in the place. I t doesn't matter if it is 52 or 102 outside, the air conditioning is still blowing at top speed. Last week when i was in, the place was like an ice box. A family put coats on their kids and another older couple was heard complaining about the cold. Do something about the temperature, i know it is hot by the grill but you are catering to customers not the employees. It is a shame that a good meal should be ruined because you cannot or will not turn the thermostat UP."}
{"text":"I am not a sandwich person but I do enjoy the occasional grinder. This place is just OK if you ask me. It is just cold cuts sliced really thin and assembled in the store. Nothing to get excited about. I do not get the fascination with cold cuts."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and friendly staff. They were offering free cookies on the day I went. I think it may have been their first day or weekend they were open.   Didn't give 5 stars as I think the whole ordering process could be better. Seems to be a bit disorganized but that could have been just due to how busy it was that day. Also a little on the pricey side for sandwiches, however if I wanted cheaper subs and less quality I'd just got to Subway."}
{"text":"Great subs much better than Subway, but pricey! 15\" $12.95 each 7.5\" $7.95 each (No 12\" subs) plus chips, plus drink!"}
{"text":"I live close by and come here consistently for lunch. Their sandwiches are always great - especially done \"mike's way.\" (If you haven't tried that yet, do it). They're always super friendly and I'm in and out in like 5 minutes. Lunchtime can be super busy, so I try to go when it's not so packed. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I really love Jersey Mike's. The only reason I don't go often is because they are VERY pricey.... 5 stars for the taste, value, and service at this location...."}
{"text":"Craving an east coast style sub, then this is your place!  Freshly baked bread and cold cuts sliced to order with your choice of toppings, or just try it \"Mike's Way!\"  The only place I have found that has cherry pepper relish (a staple on east coast subs), which gives it the \"taste of home\" for this former east coaster.  The place is located with several other restaurants and parking can be a challenge if you don't get there early.  Reward program available..."}
{"text":"This bad review will be the sixth bad review out of the last seven reviews for this place. Even the four star review acknowledges some of the problems, but still gives it four stars anyway. There are so many things wrong with this place. I am not even going to detail them since they seem to be covered in the most recent reviews. I will just say that those bad reviews ARE ALL TRUE. I will just add that the management (is there a management?) of this place is a joke. They really deserve to go out of business. The employees are allowed to just run amok and do whatever they want, and boy do they take advantage of it. The last time I was there (the LAST TIME for this location) one of the employees was messing around with every customer and actually seemed to be trying to drive customers out of the store! Disgraceful."}
{"text":"If you like a juicy sub and you don't mind onions... Ask for your sub to be made Mike's way! It's excellent."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Jersey Mike's in ages, and figured I'd give this new location a try since its not too far from the house. Also had a mailed coupon for a $7.99 combo meal so I figured what the heck why not? They advertise converting any sandwich into a wrap, so that's what I did. I ended up getting the Club Sub done \"Mike's Way\" (vinegar, oil, mayo, seasoning, lettuce, tomato and onions.) I could have easily taken 1/2 this wrap home because it was quite big. Wrap itself was pretty good, although I think the bacon and spices were throwing off the flavor a bit. The employees were friendly. I was greeted upon arrival and order taker and sandwich makers were fast and efficient. I think next time I come in I'll try one of their cheese steak sandwiches."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Jersey Mikes tonight instead of, you know, one of the other sub shops.  We were so impressed.  First of all, Eddie gave us way above normal, actually exceptional, customer service.  He brightened our day, and I'm sure we will go back just to see him.    And the sub was so good too.  Fresh and refrigerated ingredients, and Eddie made sure every condiment was symmetrically spread throughout.  I dont do too many reviews, but had to give both Eddie and Jersey Mikes 5 stars.  I know where were going for dinner when we want a great sub and exceptional and courteous service.  Thank you,  Brian and Stephanie"}
{"text":"Food, prices, cleanliness all TOPNOTCH! The owner?/manager sincerely cares about the enjoyment and wellbeing of each and every customer. What an unusual and valuable asset; keeps me comin back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see a JM opening close to my house since the one by my job has recently closed. I tried the new Rosemary Parmesan bread and it was hard as a rock.  When I called the employee that answered said that it is supposed to be hard because of the cheese and herbs baked onto the top of the bread. I have never had that issue with the herb & cheese bread at Subway. The bottom of the bread was just as hard. I went in an hour before closing and unfortunately I believe that the bread was just not as fresh as what I am used to with other JMs but the time that I come in does not make that acceptable. Disappointing is an understatement. I do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"They have the best subs in Charlotte, they make them just like being home in Jersey. I can usually get two meals out of a sub. Great meat and breads.  Whenever I think about subs I think about Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"I know this a chain so it's real easy review they are typically all the same but I love this place, only issue is sometimes I ask for certain things in a sandwich and the staff will say no problem but then make it the way they want. I guess I'm not too picky because I never say anything lol."}
{"text":"I came in last night to his jersey mikes location for a sandwich and i had the best customer service from Monique Jefferson. She was helpful, made sure i was taken care of, and on top of that made me one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I was very pleased with my visit to your location. Will be coming back !"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by stating that I have been to Jersey MIkes before and actually quite enjoy the food. My review is more or less in regards to the service. My coworker and I went here for lunch and this was the first time she had ever been to Jersey MIkes and it was my first time at this location.  When I placed my order I had forgotten that there was such thing as \"Mikes way\" and let me tell you that the lady creating the sandwiches let me know. I asked for a #6 with lettuce, tomatoes, oil and vinegar, salt and pepper and when I stated this the lady behind the counter rudely stated \"you mean mikes way\" I said sure but I did not want onions and she said even louder this time \"so you mean mikes way without the onions.,\" again I said sure. I then stated that I did not want oregano. There was an order right after mine which was a #6 as well except this time the oder came with onions and oregano.  At this point my sandwich was fine, but then when the woman began putting oregano on the sandwiches she went down the whole line (including mine) and put oregano on each one. I told her that was not what I ordered and rather than either starting over or taking off the lettuce which now had oregano all over it, she proceeded to swap my sandwich with the one behind mine, forgetting that that one had onions. I told the woman that I didnt want onions either and she looked up at me and gave me the rudest look from a restaurant employee I have ever seen. She the proceeded to take off the layer of lettuce and replace everything without oregano. The only thing that I can say for the service of this place were the two people checking people out who commented on my earrings (which made my day) and then guy cleaning the counter who was on his first day on the job, I can do with out the rude sandwich lady."}
{"text":"Came here since I had a promo coupon. Experienced poor service. Asked for wheat bread got white bread. Wasn't asked what I wanted in it. Had to ask for onions to be removed as I was paying for the sandwich. Felt like staff was just calling it in and wasn't present in what they were doing. This is my first and last visit to this location. Custom service makes a difference."}
{"text":"Really great subs! They slice the meat and cheese for every sandwich.  Great Italian subs.  Especially \"Mike's Way\"!  Which is lettuce, tomato, onion, salt, pepper, I believe oregano, and oil & vinegar.   Really great, fresh tasting subs!  And anybody notice how great the tomatoes look?  Always red, sliced uniformly, and in a nice organized line.  It's mesmerizing.  Ha!  Enjoy your sub!"}
{"text":"I had the grilled chicken Caesar salad. It was very tasty, and filling. Came with Ciabatta bread toasted  with garlic butter. I enjoyed it it was crunchy and cold. You'll like it."}
{"text":"What can I say?  The sandwiches are incredible!  A friend told me about this chain and it's now my favorite place for a great sub.  Great taste, friendly staff and...free cookies!  A little on the expensive side but well worth it"}
{"text":"This place was awesome, my girl and I used to come here when they first opened.  The owners worked, they were friendly and I forget their names but one is NY Giants fan.  They new us when we walked in.  We didn't use the coupons sent because we wanted to give them our money.   Most of the time something was wrong with the sandwich but didn't even care, it actually became fun where we'd try to guess what would be wrong. But the people working were so dope, we really never complained and came back almost every other day.   Now...It sucks.  The girl with the glasses and the Andy tattoo on her right forearm has gotta be the most miserable and rude chick ever. I feel bad for her because she's young and has a lot of life ahead of her and if that's the way she is now...sad.   I have left here multiple times without getting anything because of her.   I hope she finds a job that makes her happy.  The first time, I felt bad cuz I thought she was having a bad day.  But no, this is repetitive.  This place is great when she's not clocked in. I'm not coming back here ever because it's a waste of time finding if she's there or not."}
{"text":"Good fast sub. I ate the jersey Mike famous philly. More like a hometown sub place than subway."}
{"text":"A Tale of Two Franchisee's. I ate at the 7th Street location today & had an incredibly pleasant experience. However, it vastly reminded me of just how much of an abomination this University location is. I've never seen the lettuce any color other than white or brown. I've witnessed multiple employees wiping the vinegar soaked post-made sandwich lettuce drop-offs from the cutting board and back into the \"fresh\" lettuce bin as opposed to the garbage.   I have never sat down at a clean table on an off-peak time during the weekday. The napkin bins apparently have never been cleaned as they're caked with every dried up condiment imaginable.   Evidently I'm a glutton for punishment since I have been back a few times to give them chances to redeem themselves, yet return to work after eating and felt sick, twice. Do yourself a favor and stay away. If there were a TV show titled \"Deli Rescue\", Tohn Jaffer would \"shut it down!!\""}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday and it was so good it was busy but they worked as a team to keep the line moving and the sub (13 no pepperoni #thebestsub) was on so good tons of meat thinly sliced everything on it was fresh, Dillon made it mine and carefully chose the best tomatoes for me even discarding one that wasn't perfect that's why I'm writing this review, I've never seen that before it was like he was making a sub he would want to eat!!!! Donate 2 bucks to hurricane relief and get a free reg sub good through end of 2017. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about the sandwiches here. When I told the guy behind the counter that it was my first visit he gave me a free cookie. Bonus!  Overall great sandwich combo. Two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"They had very slow service, I ended up waiting close to half an hour for my sandwich which wasn't even that great. Maybe it was just off putting because I had to wait so long but I couldn't seem to enjoy my sub because of it. It was however better than most other fast food sandwich places out there.   The meal was more than what I wanted to spend but it didn't break my bank. Not something I would come back to unless I'm heavily craving. If I do return I'm definitely calling to put my order before showing up."}
{"text":"Great sub style sandwiches, deli sliced right when ordered.  Good cheesesteaks too.  I like to get giant sizes and make two meals of it."}
{"text":"Staff not on it like the Frankloyd Wright store.... Overwhelmed looked flustered had a buy 1 get one free charged for two subs third one free a little unorganized"}
{"text":"First  time at this jersey mike I wasn't disappointed. The staff was very friendly and the cheese steak was off the chain. When ever I'm in the area THIS jersey mike will be on my \"TO DO\" list"}
{"text":"Great staff, great food, and fast service. You can't ask for anything more. I can honestly say that I've never had a bad experience here.  Management cares about the customers and will do whatever is necessary to make sure you have a great experience."}
{"text":"gotta try this place again, tried it back in Chicago, didn't like it. Been about 4 years, let me try again in Vegas...i tried it again, not a big fan. Maybe it's the bread, or the weird guy behind the counter, but i probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Good sandwich and my daughter loves this place. She's a picky eater but she will chow down a sandwich from this place, she's seven btw."}
{"text":"Love this place, one of the best Italian subs you can get in Phoenix. Not crazy about the marinara sauce they use for the chicken parm sandwich or I would give it five stars for a fast sub shop."}
{"text":"Glad they opened one up near my house, now I don't have to drive all the way out to queen creek. Clean and new! Crew is very friendly. Online ordering currently is working 100% , places my order on the app and when I got there they had t started to make my order yet because they had to print the order out manually and then make it while I waited. Food is always good, very rare I get a bad sandwich from these guys. Only reason for the 4 star instead of the 5 star is due to the online ordering issue. Hopefully next time it will work better."}
{"text":"Chipotle Philly is superb, club supreme is great, Italian is very good. Make sure to arrive closer to 11:30 if you plan on walking in, at 11:45-ish the place is packed, although service is quick and efficient. Definitely recommend over the local hotel restaurants."}
{"text":"These are great subs and the staff at this store seem to always have a great attitude. I have had them provide very large orders on more than one occasion and each time the order was on time, correct and tasted as good as always."}
{"text":"I have been to Jersey Mikes about 5 or 6 times now and I really like this place . I was a little bit hesitatant at first since I have been to eve sub joint and figured it was going to be the same thing as the other places but I figured I'd give it a chance.  Six visits later I'm happy to write this review. I am a creachure of habit. Once I like something I get it over and over. I expand my choices but when I like it I get it. I enjoy the Club Supreme on wheat. Today's visit was the same but I  wanted to mention that the bread was fabulous.  Nice crew, clean, we'll lit inside, but a little dark out front.  I'm a repeat customer and I  recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Met up with friends here for lunch.  They handled the lunch rush pretty well but nothing outstanding or unique.  I got an Italian on wheat bread.  The bread was soft and yummy, the very limited(variety-wise) toppings were fresh, but the sandwich seemed scant on the meats.  They were generous with the tomatoes and lettuce but the sandwich was still 80% bread.  I had it \"Mike's way\", which also included what seemed like a pint of oil and vinegar on each side.  The last few bites of my sandwich were soggy-yuck!  Price is high for what you get.  Easy parking and average service.  I'm still looking for a sandwich place with the quickness of Subway but the deliciousness of Cheba Hut."}
{"text":"One of the better places to get a steak-n-cheese... it's just pretty expensive"}
{"text":"Beware the prices on the menu board are wrong.   I was overcharged on a #11.   The manager would not refund me the difference.  Said there was nothing she could do.   Said she could change the price on the menu board but that doesn't do me any good."}
{"text":"Excellent dinning experience! Took family for birthday launch and received exceptional service from the moment we walked in. The staff was great and our meal was served hot and fresh with no time wasting. The kids had lots of good words about the meal and the very professional waitress that made them comfortable and all smiles. Jersey Mike's sub is a great place and We'll definitely come back. I highly recommend! Thank you."}
{"text":"The first thing I want to say about Jersey Mikes is FRESH.  All the veggies they use are ALWAYS fresh.  The lettuce isn't wilted and the tomatoes aren't over ripe and you can actually eat the guacamole.  I HAVE NOT EATEN AT SUBWAY SINCE I DISCOVERED JERSEY MIKE'S AND NEVER WILL AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I guess the sandwich itself was good quality but the empoyees working were rude. I'm in customer service so I know how to give it and what I expect is good service. If you can't give good, friendly, efficient service then don't have a service job! The food can be good but if employees aren't good I will not return! (12/24/14 3:30 pm)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and have yet to be disappointed. The subs are giant and filled with plenty of meat and toppings. The service is friendly and patient (while I wait to figure out what to order).  They cut the meat and make your sandwich fresh as you order, unlike other places that have the entire inside of your sub already portioned out and pre-wrapped in paper/plastic.   Prices are pretty good for what you get.  I will continue to come here time and time again."}
{"text":"The service was not good. The employee were not interested in taking the order and just ignored the request"}
{"text":"I enjoy a good sandwich is this place is one of my go tos. The meat is freshly cut and served on delicious bread. Mikes way is a nice touch to add to any sandwich, although I wish it didn't make the sandwich as soggy as it did. I usually only run into that if I take the sandwich to go, so just be attentive! Service is solid as far as sandwich shops go. Decent price."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of my subway days, but WAY better!  The deli meat is cut on the spot. I couldn't stop eating it, and when I did, I was craving it.   I will definitely stop here again when I am at LAS.    The gal that made my sandwich made it phat too. The rest of the staff was really nice. Be ready with your order before you are at the front of the line, they move quick!"}
{"text":"I got a coupon for a free sandwich there. I'm glad I did because my sandwich was good. It was the Philly steak. The meat was good and flavored just right with a good amount of gooey cheese. Even better, they bake their own bread, which is very important for making a good sandwich. The service was also good. They now have a new customer."}
{"text":"I had the first Jersey mike's sandwich in LA and loved it... the meats are always freshly cut and the veggies they have are perfect for a sandwich.   Had the sandwich again the next day and it keeps getting better day by day.. good Sandwich. So long SUBWAY"}
{"text":"Poor service, get treated like you are a source of disturbance ( why are you here ) ?  And they have a tip jar....really!!  I do not mind you all being overpriced but I dislike the fact your level sucks...no spirit in your location ( it makes your food tasteless )  No pride in what you serve and when ordering Mikes way it's not even done like Mikes way?  Hopeless joint ..do not waste your money sub lovers.  ( I don't like being this harsh in my review but I have given you all many chances ..several visits and money )   My advice: close and allow another restaurant serve real subs."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this location today! It's rare that you're greeted by a pleasant employee at an establishment unless it's fine dining but at this location you will be! Quick and high quality food."}
{"text":"This place looks sharp after renovation as far as I know it's under new ownership now . Can't write a lot about sub shop it's good quick food option and service was awesome at my first visit here under new ownership"}
{"text":"First time here; and my impression was great! Clean environment, professional and friendly staff. Greeted me as soon as I walked through the door! Stayed-in to eat; when I was done I was asked how the sub was! (Seriously, that's like really cool... for a fast food joint!) Anyway, definitely recommend! Tables clean, floors clean, restroom clean... food was great! 'Til next time! ;)"}
{"text":"Let me preface this with, I love Jersey Mike's. It is hands down my favorite sub place. This place is great the staff is friendly and they do a great job. Everything always tastes fresh and the chili relish is addicting. It's a little on the pricey side a giant and two regular combos usually comes out to $19 and some change, but it is worth it. The only thing that sucks about this location is the parking it's not the best but definitely not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mike's! The food is consistent and hits the spot EVERY TIME. I love all of their sandwiches. I recently moved to San Francisco and I am so sad to say there isn't one out here! So, naturally, when I was home in AZ I had to hit up Jersey Mike's and satisfy my craving. I recommend highly to all of my friends and family. Two thumbs up for Jersey Mike's! Ps get it Mike's way!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff and they even ring a bell and acknowledge you when you leave a tip! I love that!   I'm not sure what Jersey Mike's jig is but they have many versions of a Philly Cheese Steak. I got the Big Kahuna Cheese Steak (#56). It came with grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms, jalapeños and of course extra cheese. A Giant will run you $13.95 +tax where a regular is $7.95 +tax.  I really like that they don't skimp on the meat. The meat to bun ration was almost overpowering. The aroma of my onions, peppers, and mushrooms being sauteed on their grill was intoxicating.  Unlike Subway, they don't offer a ton of toppings. You can get the subs 'Mike's Way' with onions, lettuce, tomatoes, olive oil blend, red wine vinegar and spices.   Outside of that, you can get sliced dill pickles, banana peppers, or red chili relish."}
{"text":"its closed now, out of business tried to call in an order today, no answer several times, drove to it,  found sign on door, saying closed thank you patrons.  inside was cleared out"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Service was a little slow today. Over all jersey mikes is a great lunch spot. I was a little disappointed prices have gotten me up a little. But with the new minimum wage coming into effect shortly I think we will see more of price increases.   -#10 is awesome. Mmmmm mmmmm"}
{"text":"Awful service and dirty dudes working here. They never answer the \"sub hotline\" if they do, good luck because you will sit on hold until you give up trying to give this company your money. Whoever owns/ operates this place should be ashamed"}
{"text":"I had a coupon for a free sub from this place (I know, AWESOME!), so stopped by to spend it up.   I was immediately greeted by the friendly and engaging guy behind the counter, who kept up a cheerful conversation with me throughout the preparation of my order. Didn't even bat an eye at the coupon. Love that!  The sub I ordered was the Turkey provolone. I had it \"Mike's Way\", and it tasted great. The meat is sliced when you order it. The bread was fresh, with a crispy exterior and a soft interior.   Friends who know me know that I refuse to eat at or even enter a Subway because I just can't handle how it smells in there. Completely opposite experience here.  Great food, excellent service, clean and convenient location. Yay!"}
{"text":"Love the subs here, especially being from jersey I appreciate fresh sliced meat on my sub! Which is few and far between in AZ. Cheese steaks are solid too, especially the Chipotle one. Service is never very good but whatever, I come for the food! Feels like jersey when nobody says hello or asks how your day is or says more then \"NEXT!\". Doesn't touch my favorite mom and pop shops in NJ THOUGH!"}
{"text":"Incredible sandwiches by a caring staff who goes the extra yard.   Courteous And polite and the sandwiches are bomb. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Jersey mikes is by far the best sub shop I have found. I have tried all off the other competing shops and they just don't come close. I've been a loyal customer to Jersey Mikes now for over 2 years, I have never had a bad meal from them. I have tried many subs from them. All are just amazing but my go to is the Original Italian made Mike's Way! The meats are all sliced to order, with crisp vegetables. Making the subs as fresh as could be! The services is always super friendly and speedy quick! I have recommended Jersey Mike's to all my friends and family and we all love going. If you haven't tried it I suggest you go in as soon as you can, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Number#7 Mike's way no onions  :-) Staff is very friendly and professional. I am a regular here and they are way better than subway or Port of subs"}
{"text":"Sometimes their sandwiches are great and sometimes they suck.  For what they charge you they can put more meat and be great all the time."}
{"text":"Love Jersey Mike's Subs! Haven't tried a sandwhich I didn't like. All time fave is the roast beef turkey bacon Mikes Way!"}
{"text":"Seemed like a good place to eat a first but as a first timer it's so confusing which side to order from. Just wanted a Caesar wrap and had to wait longer to order it from the \"hot\" side. I'll just go to subway thanks."}
{"text":"Short and sweet:  * terrible service * refuses to take coupons * seriously slow staff * good sandwich  Won't ever go back to this location, the service is simply too poor."}
{"text":"This is the best sub place in the valley. Thinly sliced fresh meat and always fresh bread. Not the cheapest but way worth the price!"}
{"text":"Pretty pricey for some lunch meat. We had the #9 Club supreme, giant, mikes way(with the oil and vinegar). The bread was thick and dry, and besides the oil/vinegar/spice combo and the pepper relish, which may be the only thing separating it from all the other run of the mill sandwich shops, it lacked any zing for 13.95. I'd still put it a hair above subway for quality, though, just because they slice their meats to order. The pepper relish wasn't for me, glad that I got it on the side and not on the sandwich. Unless you order from the grilled menu, your sub isn't toasted--- an option that I'm always a fan of when it comes to a 4/5 star sub. Their \"desserts\" are pre-packaged tastykakes and cookies. C'mon--- at least other stores bake frozen cookie dough on location."}
{"text":"What I ordered was good, service seemed good. My issue was that I went to pay and the system \"timed out\" as I was told and I had to start over and gave my card to the server and they ran it through their machine and I left. I looked at my bank account and noticed I was charged twice, I was on my way traveling out of town and I call the location to alert them to me being charged twice and asked what I could do. I was asked questions about what I ordered and when it was, it all was followed with \"supervisor will call you back\"..,.never got a call back and I'm left with paying $41 dollars for 2 sandwiches, yea don't take your business here."}
{"text":"Love coming here! Great club sandwich, and the coupon deals they send in the mail for buy 2 meals for 14.99 can't be beat!"}
{"text":"So we went to Jersey Mikes for lunch today. My boyfriend went and picked up lunch, brought it back to our shop. As i was about half way through my Philly sub i bit something hard. So as anybody would do I pulled it out of my mouth and as you can see it was bone/cartridge. So needless to say I called the store. Spoke to the manger Lacy who said that is not possible, our meat is brought into us. I said I don't care YOU SOLD IT TO ME. I told her i can bring you my wrapper, and the receipt to prove we bought it from you. She said well when you can prove it, call me back!! Wow what great customer service. She was unapologetic, basically called me a liar! This is horrible customer service!! So I thought I would share my horrible experience with this place. I will be headed down there with everything and see what happens then!!  So I returned to the store with the bone, and receipt. She told me this is from their peppers and it happens from time to time! So wait a minute this is from peppers yet has meat and fat on it??? this happens from time to time? THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT ON THE PHONE AND MAKE IT RIGHT? Instead you called me a liar, and provided zero customer service. She said it was against their policy to refund any money because we had used a coupon on one out of 3 of our sandwiches! I was a little frustrated and speaking firmly but she asked to me to quit yelling at her or I would have to leave the store. she was worried about what the other customers would think. Ummm lady how about the customer right in front of you? Ugh... At the end of this horrible experience i received a refund, and they lost a customer who works across the street and the business we would have brought."}
{"text":"Although the food is OK, the women who was making my sandwich was rude. I'm sure she was the manager because she was the only one not wearing a hat. She had a serious attitude problem. She put a small few drops of mayo on my sandwich, I asked for more and she globbed it on. I don't know if she was in a bad mood or not but I won't be going back unless she's not there."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious!!   I just had a delicious club supreme Mikes way! I ordered a regular length and it was plenty generous! The meat was fresh and tasty!  The flavor was enhanced by the oil and vinegar, salt and pepper and mayo! The veggies were fresh and flavorful!  The gentlemen behind the service counter were very personable! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"OK, I can't stand people saying stupid things like: So and so has a better so and so.   If you want to do ultimate sub match or a competition, go somewhere else. If I understand Yelp's philosophy right, the idea is to help people decide about a specific place  (specially if the options people give are like 15 miles away). I'm always dubious about people dropping names of other places, it seems kind of fishy or at least silly to me.  Anyways, I've been at this place several times (this location and the one on Chandler) and I've never been disappointed. Great taste, specially if you get the vinegar and olive oil. Will it get a little moist? Duh, it's vinegar and olive oil, what would you expect? Just eat it right away and enjoy.  My favorite is the Italian but since I'm trying to eat a little better, I got the turkey breast yesterday and it was pretty good.  The bathroom could be cleaner, though."}
{"text":"Our grandsons' favorite sandwich shop. The staff are outstanding; personable and quick to prepare the sandwiche. We actually frequent the store on Durango/Warm Springs."}
{"text":"My grandsons' favorite sandwiche shop. The guys at Jersey Mike's always make a great sandwiche. When I call ahead, it's ready when I arrive. A good variety of sandwiches to choose from."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Jersey Mike's subs .my favorite is the Philly cheesesteak but the turkey roast beef bacon sub is amazing too. I like when the meat is sliced fresh for each sandwich . personally I think it's one of the best in Arizona"}
{"text":"Very pricey, but what do you expect for the airport?  $8.99 for a sub seems a little out there, but to be honest, it was a very good sub.  Same Jersey Mike's quality you expect to find at any of their locations.  At least, I HOPE you expect to find it there.  I had the #13 (Original Italian, I think it was called).  There was a very sizable portion of lunch meat on the sandwich, which was awesome of course.  The toppings were very fresh, and the bread was pretty recently baked it seemed.  Despite the very long line, the staff moved quickly, but accurately, efficient and friendly as well.    It was a little more than I like to spend on lunch, but compared to the other options of burgers, pizza, and just general fried stuff, it was clearly the winner on appealing to my taste buds.  I don't like to grease-up when flying, so a sub shop usually gets my vote.  If I'm back here again and have the time, Jersey Mike's it is again."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty awful, actually.  This was my first visit to a Jersey Mike's Subs.  I was not impressed with the menu offerings - hot and cold subs, wraps, cookies, chips, drinks.  No salads, very few vegetable toppings to choose from.  Nothing remotely healthy.   I asked for a chicken sub on wheat bread, and was given a steak sub on white bread.  And this is the type of place where you order at the counter and watch them make your food.  How can they make mistakes like that?  No one even asked my husband if he wanted any toppings on his meatball sub;  they just assembled it in the hot food area and wrapped it up without even turning around.  The bread is too soft and my whole sandwich fell apart, but they don't even have forks to try to salvage it.    The best I can say about this place was that it was relatively fast and clean, and the people working there weren't rude.  That's a pretty low bar. The cost is high for what you get $7.50 for a sub with few toppings to choose from.  The meat was pretty low quality.  $12+ for the large size, with no sides.  I would never come back.  There are a half dozen different sandwich shops in the area I would go to first."}
{"text":"Wow! We flew in to Phoenix and were headed to Sedona when we stopped off for a bite. Luck brought us to Jersey Mike's and we are glad it did. My wife and I split a giant veggie sub which was fantastic. The staff was really nice and helpful. Too bad we don't have a Jersey Mike's back in Ohio."}
{"text":"My family and I went in there today.  The manager was rude and yelled at me for not knowing exactly how to say what I wanted on my sub.  I was quite embarrassed as I told him I don't work here.  For three years never had this problem till today.  I owe it up to the red eyed mouthy manager."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great staff and better sandwiches!  The cheesesteaks are my go to, but the cold subs are also very good with meat cut fresh to order and plenty of veggies to add on.  Our go to place for our  sandwich fix."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches......good service, even though this is a chain they're consistently good. Only one complaint....out of wheat bread on more than one occasion.  I suggest #43 chipotle cheesesteak, good sandwich.....next time I think I'll try #13 the Italian."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's Subs at the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, specifically next to Nathan's, Between C22 & C23 (in the Southwest Terminal).   After walking around the terminal, looking for something to eat for dinner (Although I had brought food with me, it wasn't quite enough to hold for dinner), my husband and I ended up picking this place. As we looked over the menu, it dawned on me that it would be cheaper to purchase a giant size sandwich instead of a regular size sandwich for the 2 of us. So we ended up getting:  Giant Size #7: Turkey Breast And Provolone, $16.99 prior to tax- Because I do not like spicy foods, we omitted the jalapenos (although I am sure if we requested for half of the sandwich to have it, I am sure the employee making our sandwich would be able to accommodate). We also omitted the onions, pepper, oil & vinegar (my husband just decided to omit these things just in case I do not like them. Like a true Yelp member, I was busy taking photos of this place and the menu board to pick what I wanted on the sandwich so I let my husband make that decision). The sandwich itself was really good. I thought the sandwich had plenty of turkey and also lettuce and tomato. The freshly sliced provolone (an employee slices it right in front of you as you order your sandwich) had a great flavor that enhanced this meaty sandwich.  ------------------------- (Total= $18.39 after tax)  All of the employees helping us were very friendly (the person who initially took our order, the person helping to add the toppings on our sandwich and the person helping to ring us up at the register). I appreciated that when I asked if they could quarter our sandwich since half of a sandwich is just way too large of a size to eat, they did so happily.   The only thing that did bug me though was that the employee wrapped our sandwich (after cutting it into 4 sandwiches) in 1 large butcher paper and stuffed it into a narrow paper bag. I would have preferred for 2 sandwiches to be wrapped separately from the other 2 so that each person could have their own. Maybe this is something I can request for in the future.   I know that the prices for this sandwich place is pretty high, especially compared to any other location of Jersey Mike's that isn't at the airport. But I have accepted the fact that a lot of airport eateries will charge a higher price because you are in a desperate and vulnerable spot (and maybe the rent at the airport is high) and so that isn't as big of a concern to me. My husband and I travel a lot so it just comes with the territory (but please note that not all airport restaurants have such a high inflated price. Some places are actually quite reasonable, but this airport isn't 1 of them).  Overall, I really liked my sandwich and was pretty satisfied after having 1/4 of the sandwich and saved the other 1/4 for the next day (a little soggy from the filling but still pretty tasty).   If I was ever at this airport, down in this terminal again, I would consider getting another sandwich here."}
{"text":"Called in a pick up order. Due to their on line menu not being very descriptive of all the options, I had some questions. The person on the phone got annoyed, and said \"I don't have all day to take a phone order!\". I ordered my sandwich. and decided to get food from Sacks instead. They can shove my unclaimed order up their noses! I don't think I'll be back to rude Jersey Mike's again. East coast assholes for sure!!  SMH! WTF happened to customer service, and common courtesy?"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches a bit overpriced. First time there was OK, slow on the service since all meats are sliced to order and if others ahead of you. You get the idea.  Second time there a few months back, no white bread only wheat so we did not order and left. Just the other night for our third visit again, no white bread only wheat. In all fairness the kid behind the counter said they only had wheat but I misunderstood they had no wheat. Point is if you don't have what the customer wants, you won't be in business long. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Part of my quest to eat something that's not available in Flagstaff after lacrosse games in Scottsdale. Decent sandwiches, good hard working service. Not much variety, but I am not a very picky eater. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, kinda $$$ for sandwiches."}
{"text":"Me and this particular store have been this love/love relationship for years. When I was personal assistant for some millionaire, this was the place I would go get the sandwiches for his Friday lunch meetings. And since then I never forgot the kind of service I would get them.  Nothing on the menu is bad. I feel like this is the best chain sandwiches in the USA. I love their roast beef and pepperoni sandwiches Mikes Way. But their best sub is there Roast Beef Turkey Club (with mayo) MIkes Way. Their bread is something that Subway needs to notes on. The price is a bit higher than most places, but its worth it.  I am not being bias since I am from NJ... Ok, maybe I am.  What are you doing.... GO EAT!!!!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Vegas, I had a few hours to kill in the airport and some of that time needed to be used on eating - no one likes to fly hungry. I scanned the reviews of all of the restaurants in the terminal I was in and really just nothing was standing out to me. Am I surprised? No. No one like airport food. My decision to eat at Jersey Mike's was mostly made because one had just opened in Reno and I was curious about their sandwiches.  There is no place to sit down here, it's just a walk up counter to order, pay, and get your sandwich. Finding a chair or a table elsewhere is totally up to you. I decided on the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich (because I'm a sucker for steak and fake cheese). I can't comment on the authenticity, but I did find it quite good (albeit quite messy too). It was a nice size and they don't skimp on the meat.  Yes, it's fast food. Yes, it's fake cheese. Yes, there are probably healthier options. But if you want a quick sandwich that is pretty good and will fill you up, this is a good bet."}
{"text":"Usually pretty good , had a couple bad experiences where the lettuce was too watery and soaked the bread, but other than that 95% of time it's great."}
{"text":"I signed up for the text specials and was in the area and thought I would finally stop in here with my 8yr old for lunch.  First frustration came when the kids meal had 3 sandwich options, one being salami.  Maybe it's just me, but that seems like a strange choice for kids. Well my son didn't like any of the 3 choices and since you can't substitute I ended up getting him a 6 in meatball sub. because if course this sandwich didn't have a \"mini\" option.  I picked the roast beef and provolone or #6.  With the choice of mini, 6 in or giant I knew I was hungrier than a 6 in but there's no 12 inch option so I went with the 15 in giant.  I thought when I said #6 I was ordering a combo, but as I saw later on my receipt that was NOT the case.    And frankly I wouldn't have even posted a 1 star review if it wasn't for what I found on my receipt.    So as we are sitting there and i'm no longer starving and can focus again I take a look at my receipt.  HOLY CANOLIS!!!  a lunch for 2, well 1 and 1/2 (he's a small 8 yr old) at a sub shop came to $31.55!!!!    Yeah I know....I should have paid more attention but I WAS SOOOO HUNGRY.  So the break down is giant #6 12.45 regular meatball                        7.50 reg COMBO                              2.19 reg combo                                 2.19 YEAH.....12.45 & 7.50 was just the sandwiches!!!! Boy I'm feeling really stupid about now...but it gets better..... after my 24.33 and 1.96 tx it says ADDED TIPS!!!!!  5.26   THIS IS WHY I EVEN BOTHERED TO POST THIS.  When I brought it to the cashiers attention she said \"oh you must have push the button.\"    UMMMM NO WAY IN HALIBUT did I accidentally tip 5.26!!  Than when the other employee came up and asked what was wrong she replied \"it's adding tips again.\"    I NEVER look at my reciept....guess I'm too trusting.  But I'm glad I did that day.  And I can't help but wonder how many people they do this to and it never gets noticed."}
{"text":"Make sure they listen to how you like your sub. My wife and I have never had a problem with the ones we have been to in the Dallas area. But this one screwed up both of our orders a little (not horribly bad), but it was apparent they didn't listen very well to how wanted our subs. The staff was very nice though."}
{"text":"I'll start with the fact that I eat a lot of subs. I've given Jersey Mike's a try about three times now and each time I end up disappointed.   Deli meat is cut fresh so you'd think it would be juicy and taste fresh - yet I always find it to taste gritty and lack much flavor. Bacon even doesn't taste like anything.  You get about a 6\" sub for $9, so price-wise it's not a deal compared to other chains in the area. I'd suggest you drive further up McKnight and grab a sub at GetGo or Dibellas instead."}
{"text":"Better than average subs for a national chain- a level above Subway & Quiznos, but not as good as Penn Station. Get the Original Italian 'Mike's Way'.  The subs are then doused in vinegar, oil, and spices.  The subs are good, but quite messy.  The service at this particular location is very uneven- last time I went there were four employees; one doing all the work and the other three had no clue and had to be told everything from running the register, to how many onions to put on the grill. Get the staff in order!"}
{"text":"Really great subs - fast, delicious dinner!"}
{"text":"I love this jersey mikes! I often call ahead to order because I am a teacher and when I show up my sandwiches are made and everything is perfect! The workers there are great and always friendly! I suggest the #13 Italian sub but ALL of their subs are awesome! Also, if you ask for it with the bread hallowed out it lets you taste the sandwich better!"}
{"text":"I love your subs , but I went in there and saw many flies , so I kindly told the worker , I was not ordering because of all the flies and walked out... ekk gross."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but yesterday was my first and last visit. For 1.) it's expensive ($45 for 3 sandwiches) and 2.) the \"manager\" Jesse had extremely bad customer service and was borderline rude. No wonder the place looked like a ghost town. As a manager I would expect you to set the example for everyone else, especially if you're training a new hire!"}
{"text":"I can't believe people are comparing Jersey Mike's to Subway!!!!!!  No way...They slice the meat and cheese right in front of you....it is not all-processed and been sitting in a tub all day like the competitor's.  The produce is always so fresh..and on top of it....everyone is super friendly in there...  Subway does not even come close to comparing!  Sure it is a little pricier ...but I am more than willing to pay more for better tasting, fresher food..."}
{"text":"Majority of the time excellent and opened earlier than the other restaurants at the C Gates.  The Turkey & Provolone & Italian are both excellent.  Ingredients look & taste fresh, except once the bread was stale.  I add mustard, black olives, oregano to either & mmm mm."}
{"text":"The guy that helped me was very nice. However for $7 I expect more out of my sandwich. I had the tuna salad, which wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Honestly I could get a better, less expensive sub at sub station two or Harris teeter."}
{"text":"Tasty, fast lunch option. The staff at this location are always extremely friendly even if the line is out the door. I do suggest you get here before 11:30am or after 1:00pm to avoid the crowds. I always get the turkey and provolone on wheat Mike's way (without tomatoes).  They slice their meats fresh and they are generous with the toppings, but sometime add too much oil...so keep that in mind.  I think Jersey Mike's has become my favorite fast sub sandwich chain. They may be a bit more pricey but they beat the snot out of Subway and Jimmy Johns when it comes to service and taste.  Happy Lunching!"}
{"text":"Went to Jersey Mike's for the first time-- I always drive by it and decided to give it a try. I ordered online. It was really easy and the food was ready when I arrived. It was nice and clean inside and the people who worked there were friendly .I got both a cold sub (Italian) and a hot sub (Kahuna Cheese Steak). They were EXCELLENT. Next time, I will request oil on the side for the Italian sub because it soaked through the bread when I got home. Nevertheless, I am a fan and will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Randomly changing it up from Subway...and I had a coupon :o) Thank goodness for the coupon... Had the Chipotle Philly--yummy! Cheesey and meaty, included onions and peppers. There was another option with jalapenos and shrooms that sounded pretty good too. Choice of wheat or white bread and they slice the meat right there. Since it was a hot sub, I ended up waiting about 5-10 minutes from when I paid.  Here's why I thank the coupon--$7 for the sammich! Not the meal, just the sammy. I understand that not everywhere has a $5 footlong, but for the meal, you're approaching $9/$10. Seems kinda steep for a sammich, a bag o chips, and a drink. But, there were numerous people in there, so maybe that's just me.  Employees: a couple of them were really nice (and apologized for the wait), one of them not so much. Kinda made me feel like I had to apologize for coming in and that it was a pain to ring up my order. Same goes with customers, but they don't have any control over those..."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a Jersey Mikes sandwich.  I have to say it was really good. I had the roast beef, with just pickles and pepper.  The roast beef had a great taste, and was quite tender. The bread was crusty and crunchy, which I prefer.  The staff was nice and helpful. I was in and out of there in 5 minutes.  I will come back to try the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Fresh amazing subs. Meat cut right in front of you and veggie always look freshly cut. The staff at this location is always friendly and almost knows me by name even though I only come 2-5 times a month. Definitely my #1 sub company. I alway get The Cali Mike's way. Yum."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches at this place! I like the flavors of everything in my sandwiches so I get Mike's way plus all the rest of the condiments. It never disappoints. I'm glad they started opening more locations on the north/west side of town"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is just your standard sub shop. I wouldn't say it's anything more impressive than Subway. However, the Mike's sauce that it comes with is delicious! I got the sauce on the side and enjoyed dipping my Italian sub in it."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in Jersey Mike I have been a customer there since day one recently I have been getting really hard bread that is so hard I cannot enjoy my sandwich how do you expect to keep customers when you're serving them hard bread can I request soft bread they say they have to cook all the bread hard as a brick or they'll get in trouble.  and how can I enjoy their sandwich you guys need to change that because you're going to lose a customer"}
{"text":"There service was  the work fast on big orders and they don't make mistakes. The roast beef sandwich I ate was the best I've had so far here in Charlotte. I recommend everyone to pass by."}
{"text":"I am going to give them a 3 and that is only because one of the stars is for service, their employees are friendly and personable. Sandwiches *2* mostly bread and soggy if you get it MIKES WAY! And just found out they give their employees 10-12 hrs a week...really!   GO TO FIREHOUSE SUBS!!! Try the ITALIAN, AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Subs!  They have the freshest sub rolls!  My grandkids won't eat any other sub.  Their favorite is the turkey.  We have eaten here many times and will continue to do so.  Whether it's take out or eat in everyone enjoys it!  Family atmosphere.  The staff is well trained and courteous."}
{"text":"It's like Subway, except deli style with really fresh and good food. Service is really good. Also, they offer their sandwiches in three different sizes, which is perfect depending on how hungry you and the family are."}
{"text":"The place was super dirty feeling and looking. The ingredient selection reminded me of subway or blimpie. Nothing fancy or special and over priced. Especially being in Scottsdale it should be a bit classier for the prices. The employees were nice but seemed a little \"unkept\" and all over the place. Very little order."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best sub place around! About as close as you can get to the original Jersey Mike's place down the shore in good ol' Jersey. Order #13, the Original Italian, for an amazing experience! Make it a combo with a soda and chips and you ha e the perfect meal!  On a diet? Skip the bread and they will make your sub into s delicious salad! There is also kid's menu that the little ones will love! More later. Gotta finish this tasty meal!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and best sandwich place around. Get the Italian and definitely get it mikes way"}
{"text":"Although I've been to three locations, this one is the one I go to the most.  The food is great, I'm rather partial to the Chipotle Cheese Steak.  You can get extra, or double, meat for a few bucks more which turns it into a rather good meal.  It can get a bit expensive though.  I've also tried their meatball sub, it was good but a little plain.  They didn't offer to add any toppings and I forgot to ask.  It would have been great with some black olives and onions though.  I also tried the Reuben, it was good but I found myself wishing that I had gotten the Chipotle Cheese Steak instead.  Since the first time we tried it, we've gone back about 4 times a year and enjoy it every time."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! We ordered lunch delivery for a group of 10 at work and half of our sandwiches were missing, along with all of our chips and drinks. When we called back, the employee who answered the phone said \"well sorry, we're really busy and my manager isn't here.\" No offer to fix the situation. When asked when we would get the rest of our delivery she told us we needed to come pick up the rest of the order ourselves and that they would \"maybe\" comp our sandwiches. Totally unacceptable and I will no longer visit this location!"}
{"text":"So I have to give this review an update. The owner contacted me and invited me to try this location again. They had made a management change and I was to ask for the new manager when I got there. I thought what the heck everyone deserves a second chance.   The new manager, Lawrence, is super friendly and gave me great service. The vegetables are fresh again and the sandwiches are back to Jersey Mikes standards. What a difference from just a month ago. So if you have previously tried this location and were unhappy i say try it again and you will be happy you did.   Thank you Duane and Lawrence for the great service! Jersey Mikes is back in my lunch rotation!"}
{"text":"I was actually a little let down after my first time of trying Jersey Mike's because I was expecting something amazing from all the positive things I have heard about it.   My opinion was that it was slightly better than Subway, but there are several other sandwich places I would rather go to. I ordered an Italian sandwich, and it was good but quite standard. I was not impressed with the prices and found them to be a little much, so its not likely that this place will be a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Always a safe bet for a sandwich. Nothing that stands out for me, just a decent sandwich and my kids like it."}
{"text":"Best Jersey Mikes around! I've been to many of these places and this one is by far the best. You can really tell that the management/ownership takes pride in what they do. The ingredients were fresh and the sandwiches are properly made. If you're looking for a great sandwich in the 7 hills area I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Jersey mikes. This one is no exception. The staff has always been really friendly and the one guy always recognizes me somehow. And of course, the sandwhiches are on point. Club supreme is the way to go."}
{"text":"No value for money here! just went in and purchased the super sub, and I have to say there is nothing super about it! Meat is watery and very thinly sliced, only two types of bread (white or wheat), very little flavor, hardly any topping choices.... For being my first time trying this \"chain\" out I am disappointed with quality. Not worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Asked them to turn on the baseball playoff game and was told that the owner took the remote control to his home.  I then asked them for the password to the WiFi and was told that the owner doesn't want anybody using it but himself ...  To the owner:  Please enjoy the $10 that I spent at your restaurant as it will be the last money that I will ever spend at your business.  You need to get with the program as it is very common for patrons to ask for the TV channel to be changed (especially when it is playoff season) and so you know any business that doesn't offer WiFi to its customers is definitely the exception to the current way of operating a business.  Anyways, good luck to you and your outdated way to conduct business in the year 2015"}
{"text":"You can't ask for more at this location good music, good service and the best staff ever and it starts with good management, Latoya thanks to you and your crew for making my experience one of the best you are doing an amazing job keep up the good work...."}
{"text":"I've seen Jersey Mikes around the city for years but had a long standing allegiance to Subway and Jimmy Johns. I no longer eat Subway and didn't want JJ or a sub from GetGo on this day. I used Yelp to find JM's close to me and decided to give it a try. I was impressed that they cut my deli meat and cheese to order and their option of making my sandwich the \"Mikes Way\" was intriguing so I tried it. The club sandwich was pretty basic other than the Mikes Way addition but it was very good overall. I ate my sandwich too slowly so it got soggy toward the end but otherwise no complaints."}
{"text":"Dang it has to be one of the best sub shops out here. From the 4 sandwiches I've tried. All have been amazing and fresh. Staff is always friendly as well."}
{"text":"This pains me to give Jersey Mike's such a low rating, but they are ridiculous. I have not yelped in years, but after today's experience I am just beside myself. Long story short, I am a huge fan of Jersey Mikes. My typical go to is the turkey and provolone, but I am currently 6 months months pregnant and cold deli meat is a no no. Also, I usually order online from my office which I prefer but because the website does not allow to customize I have to walk in (another thing that needs to be fixed). I go in and tell the guy I would like a grilled chicken breast and provolone sub. The guy gets a blank look and about to pass out... he says what? I again, this time a little slower, grilled chicken breast and provolone. You would have thought I just asked him to perform brain surgery. Note I did check the menu prior to ordering to see that they have chicken breasts, so it is not like they do not have them. Finally, he starts making the sub, though he decides to let me know how ordering off menu throws off inventory??? WTF? First do I look like I care. I all of sudden had a flash back to ten years ago when Chris Bianco refused to change an ingredient on a pizza I ordered, really??? really??? Also, I have attempted to order the same sub at other locations in the valley and get the same idiotic dumbfounded response each time. Enough is enough.. sorry Jersey Mikes but we are done."}
{"text":"First and last time at this location. I always go to the Tempe location off Scottsdale and the 202. I also go to the Scottsdale location off frank Lloyd Wright and the 101. Both places are great. Great customer service. Great sandwiches.  As for this location, I get skimped on meat and feel like I'm only eating bread. Let alone the two employees working behind the counter who seem too nervous to look at the customers and start a conversation. I'm hungry man. Can't be wasting $13 on a giant for only bread. C'mon now."}
{"text":"First time trying Jersey Mikes and I must say I was so impressed! I had a BBQ chicken sub made by Allison! not even on the menu and they still made it for me, and the cashier Nicola was very kind and helpful! will be returning"}
{"text":"Yesterday was our first time at Jersey Mike's. We were actually closer to a different one but decided to drive to this location because it had better Yelp reviews. We weren't disappointed! We were greeted immediately by the cashier (Alayna). The general manager (Manny) was on his way out the door but stayed to chat with us when we told him that this was our first time at a Jersey Mike's. We ordered two sandwiches -- the pastrami and a cheesesteak. Mmmmmmmm... We were in heaven! We'll definitely be returning to this place! (It's on West Cheyenne and is a couple doors down from Steiner's.) By the way... Thank you, Kyle! You made my sandwich perfectly!"}
{"text":"i just placed a postmates order through this location and did not receive the sandwhich i order wharsoever. i asked for the bread to be toasted, it was not toasted. i asked for extra pickels, not only was there not extra pickles there werent any pickles at all. i asked to sub out the neats for something else, and got the original meats that were on the sub. i order the exact same sandwhich at every jersey mikes i go to and have never had a problem with it before. this was supposed to be my hangover meal and i was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Always loved jersey mikes and frequent the one in Vegas atleast once every 2 weeks. Nothing wrong with the subs here but was a bit turned off when goin to check out the cashier made me accept 10%, 15%, or 20% gratuity. Listen kid, thanks for makin my sandwich but you didn't serve me to deserve 20%. Next time I'll come in and sit down and wait for u to come over take my order, refill my drinks, clean up after me, etc. if u want my 20%. I pretty much always throw my change or a dollar or 2 in the tip jar at this place but to be put on the spot like this was very irritating. C'mon management you shouldn't let your employees get away with this. Are they on a tip compliance ?? Because if not you could get yourself in hot water with the IRS"}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mikes & was so glad when this one opened. The ingredients are fresh, service was really quick and the employees were really friendly! The #13 (Italian) is my personal go-to sandwich, Mike's Way, of course. Oh and add Cherry Pepper Relish, trust me! The \"mini\" is the perfect size for lunch, too!"}
{"text":"Its ok, not the greatest. Ordered a ham and cheese sandwich, only got a couple pieces of ham, forgot to heat like i asked, forgot the mayo and onions, so they gave me a mayo packed instead. Keep bugging us as we eat, asking to throw away garbage, asking how the food is etc.. I know they just opened, and want feedback, but it really was overkill!"}
{"text":"Best Roast Beef (by a chain) by far! Great food, and exceptional customer service. Cookies are good too!"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST sub place in the valley! I've eaten at the original Jersey Mike's restaurant down the Jersey shore and can testify this is the real deal. Everything they make is great, but the Italian subs with all the trimmings make my mouth water just thinking about them! MUCH better than Subway, Firehouse or Jimmy John's (particularly the JJ's on Germann by the Home Depot. They are a disgrace to the Jimmy John's franchise!) There is an awful lot of FAKE NYC, NJ and Chicago style food in Arizona, but Jersey Mike's subs are authentic to their origins. Tony Soprano and his family would eat here! I will probably eat here at least weekly."}
{"text":"Have been eating subs from here for years now. Always the freshest breads meats and vegetables to go on your made to order sandwich. Love the Daily lunch specials, probably one of the best sub places around Id have to say. Anyways if your in the waterdame area stop in and grab a sub you wont regret it, id suggest to get your Sub mikes way too !"}
{"text":"Staff were over the top on customer service. The best part, I think they were being genuine. Food was good. Low key kinda place, patio seating is a nice option for people watching!!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the fact that I love sandwiches. I love bread. I love everything associated with a good sandwich. I love the #9. I mean love. My rating is on the service and not my yummy sandwich! I have to say that I won't be returning to this location which sucks because it's sooooo close to my house.   What I don't love is a certain employee over the last couple of months jacking up my sandwich 800 different ways. I'm not sure why I have to repeat LITERALLY every single item 2-3 times. When I say no cheese I mean no cheese. When I say wheat, well damn it I want wheat. I have had to stop this guy the last two times so he could focus. He adds things and forgets things. I shouldn't be frustrated while ordering a sandwich. Tonight I had to tell him to \"please listen to what I'm saying.\" He laughs... I also had to say, \"could I get a ripe tomato instead of the hard green ones?\" He even said they looked gross and he wouldn't eat them.   I'm not sure what this dudes issue is. Maybe it's because his friends are usually sitting there waiting for their free food. Maybe it's because the tv is distracting him...2 weeks ago I asked him to stop watching and cut my bread. I just can't take the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Been hereca total of twice enjoying a big kahuna philly n another occasion sum other philly both were extremely tasty only thing i frown upon is their bread selection .... other that they killn subway n though i have not had capriottis dunno if it gets any better than a hot jersey mikes sub.... enjoy"}
{"text":"Whoever manages this location runs one damn loose ship. I just walked in and wanted to order food only to be greeted by teenagers who just stared at me like a Martian with their hands in trash bags. I asked them if they were closing thinking there must be a reason for the very odd atmosphere...no response. What the hell did I just experience?"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a super quick lunch with my kids. So good and everything about this place makes me happy. The good is Fresh and the sibs are delicious. They have classic Philly cheesesteaks and also some old school Italian, chicken, etc subs as well. The service is not super fast as re all done by hand and they actually slice the meat while you are standing there . In the end, it's so worth it because it's very good. If you are into salads- like me- you can get a sub made into a salad- I always do that and it's perfect.  The people who work here are super nice and the places is very clean and well maintained. Suggest it if you are in the chagrin area and if you love a good cheesesteak! Cannot beat it. Also, they have the Miss Vickies chips here- and in so many flavors. Love these chips and would eat them by the handful if I could"}
{"text":"This is the best sub shop. My 11 year old son loves it. He will not try any other sub shop again. You must try it for yourself I promise you won't be disappointed. Their prices are fair.   On 3/25/15 all proceeds will go to Phoenix Children's Hospital a good cause."}
{"text":"This is now my number two place in the valley to get a sub sandwich. Mike's Way makes all the subs taste fantastic and I can't get enough of the club. The bacon that is added to the sandwich provides the perfect amount of crunch and mouth feel to keep me coming back week after week. The employees are friendly and always smiling."}
{"text":"When you say you have gluten free bread it should be available at all hours of the day."}
{"text":"The employee that decided to make fun of another employee took away from what is a usually very good experience at this location.  The young man making the sandwich was being very friendly, asked all the right things to make sure everything would be made correctly and was a pleasure. Then another employee started saying and asking things that made it clear that he was making fun of him or taunting him. The first employee looked shaken up by this but continued his excellent customer service.   Other employees got quiet and busy to stay out of it.  Food is always great, but manager should be checking out this kind of treatment by one employee to another."}
{"text":"You get a lot of sub for a low price. They stack them tall with ingredients, and freshly slice the deli cheese.  The employees are very friendly and quick.  I kind of wish they had more of a variety of vegetables though... I got a turkey sub, and it was enormous for the price.  I recommend it if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"Wow, just tired the special hot sandwich (they called it the \"Oliver Special\")... simply amazing!  I've been going to this store for lunch a while and pretty much everything on the menu is awesome, but this one was worth Yelping about.  Meats and cheeses are sliced for you when you order.  Costs a bit more than Subway but worth it!  will be back!"}
{"text":"I've never heard of Mike's Jersey Subs before a week ago.  I finally tried them last Thursday and went back for more today.    They have very delicious sandwiches.  I've tried the cold and the hot subs.  Both left me wanting more.  The ingredients in these subs may be fresher than Subway as they slice the meat in front of you.  The only downside to delicious food is the price is more than Subway but very worth it.  This place puts Subway to shame and I'll never go back as long as I live close to Mike's.      I give them 5 stars for good food and a professional staff."}
{"text":"Came in today for my first time number 43 and number 6 both sandwiches will good the establishment was clean and the hostess was friendly will come again the 43 is steak sandwich in the number 6 is a famous roast beef"}
{"text":"Terrible service at this location. We placed a $60 order online using the fun yelp app.  Unfortunately, the website defaulted our order to Monday not Sunday. No big deal right? Wrong. The store said they couldn't go find our order and they couldn't transfer it. Ok.... then they said \"we can't help you until the lunch rush dies down\". Ummmmm really, we have already paid you. we offered to write it down again and have them make it. They were not happy. Come on guys you could have handled this a lot better then what you did."}
{"text":"We visited here last week and I couldn't yelp about it at the time.  This was probably one of the best subs I've ever had.  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the food was beyond fresh and delicious.  They slice the meat right in front of you, the fixing's are simple(the pickles a must if you like them),  and the bread was soft and flavorful.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A little pricey and the service was not very fast but the red pepper relish is a real treat. Mostly sweat with a tart kick."}
{"text":"Thanks great food   Superb sandwiches and friendly service.  Quality meats and sides like this place"}
{"text":"Good subs but far overpriced compared to Subway and Firehouse, even after taking into account the slightly larger JM subs."}
{"text":"We were specifically looking for a Mike's jersey subs. We almost didn't find this place in this shopping mall area.  This location was clean and service was good. Glad they had several large screen TV'S in this place. Each had something different on. We got the giant Italian sub.  It was good and fresh.  Will eat here again in the future if in the area."}
{"text":"In the past I've enjoyed eating here, fresh sandwiches and good service. Tonight was my last visit to this location. The two girls working were hostile the moment I came in (only customer in the shop). Glaring, didn't speak a word to me, and ignored my request for provolone cheese instead of American. She ran her fists down the bag to squash the sandwich then shoved it me and glared again before turning back to the other employee to talk. Paid 8 bucks for a sandwich I don't want to eat. Never been treated like this at a Jersey Mike's, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"What great service, the two guys working were so nice and happy, great energy, would definitely come again especially if those two were working , I'm sorry now I didn't get their names"}
{"text":"Wow,let me just start off by saying color me impressed.  I had a coupon for a free sub, I figured hey I'll give it a try.  That hit the spot, I don't know what to say more than that.   I got the number 13, Mike style, which means no Mayo!  As somebody who can't stand mayo let me just say when the signature style has no mayo I will take that as a good sign.  I don't know what it was but that was exactly the right combo.    I'm half tempted to go back, not that it wasn't satisfying enough by itself but I'm just knocked out right now, the right mix of bread, cheese,meat veggies and oil and vinegar.  It was just right.  I think I found a new lunch spot."}
{"text":"Staff were friendly and the sub's were delicious. I just moved here from LA and never tried this place. They do have them over there but not like here. Anyways, I highly recommended this place especially that the bread looks, smells, and tastes very fresh."}
{"text":"I'll sum it up quickly:  the service is great, and the sandwiches are BOMB!!! (I'd suggest putting that cherry pepper relish on your sub for some extra kick.)  Ever since this location opened, I've wanted to try it out.  Been going back for a couple months now, and I love the place.  Their \"Original Italian\" is just delicious.  If you haven't been there yet, you gotta go!  You don't go there and pay five bucks for a limp sub that has you searching for meat.  At Jersey Mike's, it's a little pricier, but you get a big sandwich with big flavor, and there's plenty to share.  I also appreciate seeing smiling staff that you can actually hold a conversation with while they make your order.  That puts me in a good mood even after a long day at work.  Good food, good service.  I'll be back, and I'm bringing others with me!"}
{"text":"I think the key is to know what to order here. I had the turkey sub once, and it was eh, just ok. I then returned and got the veggie sub with everything other than olives and jalapeños, and it was AMAZING! I'd suggest eating it there though, because if you get it with the oil and vinegar it is going to be a 100% soggy mess. If you like your bread more bread than soup, just take my advice, and pop a squat at one of their tables. Super yummy veggie sub though, I find myself craving it!! Not normal for just veggies and bread!!"}
{"text":"Being from Jersey and loving Jersey Mike's for so many years, having it in Arizona, really made my day, when I moved here last year."}
{"text":"Amazing subs! You can taste the freshness in each bite. Absolutely love J Mike's. They have the best cold subs in the valley. Service was okay, but they are quick and get me back to work in time to enjoy."}
{"text":"These guys never disappoint. Recommend the #13 or #17. Sign up for the sub club and collect your points for free subs. It can get busy during lunch, so order online if you can to avoid wasting your precious lunch hour."}
{"text":"I have been to this location three times since they have opened and each time has been more of a disappointment.  As a loyal Jersey Mike's customer and Shore Points member, I will not step foot in this location again.  The first two times I received the wrong order, so on the third visit I watched closely while my order was butchered again.  I left on the third visit when my order was given to another customer.   If you're the owner/operator/manager stop by the Val Vista location and pick up some pointers from their crew."}
{"text":"Beware under new ownership and some may think yay better then the last well im here to tell you no no way horrible horrible horrible they are way disorganized either the new owner hasnt been in to see this or is not doing any must needed changes the workers are rude and have no manners the buliding is dirty im so disappointed I havnt been here for so long and was expecting my clean friendly enjoyable sandwich shop its not that anymore fix this new owner and I'll fix my review good luck I'll take my business to another store I will add food is still good and thats what you get these two stars for I would start by replacing the rude crew on shit this sunday afternoon on march six you can not treat people this way and expect anything better then this review here with expectations for the young man who might just need better training or better co workers"}
{"text":"This location of Jersey Mikes is really spot on with service and quality. I used to work In the same shopping center and would frequently order here. Dine in or take out the same attention to detail was there. Friendliness of the staff and the fact they remembered me and my order was a huge plus! Great job guys!! 5 stars all the way!!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time and was very satisfied.  Clean, friendly staff with great customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious roast beef and provolone sandwich at Jersey Mikes.  Meat was tasty and rare in the middle and bread was soft with an outer crust.   Very clean with a nice selection of chips and soda.  Good addition to Bainbridge.  Find it in the shopping center next to Heinens."}
{"text":"Don't know his name, but really sweet guy with snake bites made me a bomb ass veggie sammy"}
{"text":"I would give them 0 stars if I could.  I order a veggie sub.   The person makes the sub and hands it off to some kid.   I say I would like it Mike's Way NO OIL.  He makes the sub and then proceeds to dump a bucket of oil on the sandwich.  Fine - no problem, make me another sandwich.   His solution, scrap the lettuce and shit off the sub and proceed to re add lettuce and stuff.   I am like no I want another sandwich he says \"but I took the oil off\".   How do you take OIL OFF of a sandwich????  He kept arguing with me, another employee told him to make another sandwich.   I just said screw you I am out of here if that is how you treat your customers.  We are in there all the time - no more.  Some real winners work at this location, let me tell you."}
{"text":"I ordered a regular(7\"-$6.95) Big Kahuna Cheese Steak to go. It has grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms, jalapenos and extra cheese. It was really good. The bread wasn't even soggy and it took me 20 minutes to get home!"}
{"text":"We love Jersey Mikes!  Mike's way Italian is really good.  Our family of 6, eats here a few times a month."}
{"text":"I had Jersey Mike's for the first time ever and it was pretty good. The only thing that bothered me as a first time customer is that they expect you to know how their line works. When we asked them to put mayo on our subs, after we ordered, one of the workers rudely told us that we need to do so when we first order. Okay not a big deal, but she could have been a lot nicer when she said it. Overall I'll give them a four."}
{"text":"This Jersey Mikes is alway good. There service is great. They are very nice. This location does a great at job at making you feel like a regular there and they appreciate you as a customer. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Always reliable, it serves my Sub cravings every time.  Enough said :)"}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if it was an option. Nothing to do w food just service. Had to walk out of Jersey Mikes by the outlet mall on Las Vegas Blvd!  Waited 30 min with no one in front of me. The kids had to put toppings on 9 sandwiches and spent 20 min staring at the ticket and 2 min fixing the sandwiches. It took 3 girls close to 30 min to put toppings on sandwiches I can't believe it. Was so bad I won't ever go back to that location again. I love their roast beef sub but that location is the worst.  Seriously they would put lettuce on the sandwich and had to read the ticket again and would put tomato on"}
{"text":"All bread. Got a steak and cheese and it was just bread basically. Last two times I've been to this location it's gone down hill"}
{"text":"Ordered online, simple enough. My sandwich was completely screwed up EVERYTHING! (just as other reviewers stated), no bacon, no mayo, no meat to speak of (as others warned would happen). Called up there, they said the issue was with \"the young kids\" working there... Ok, train them better! Wanted me to come get a new sub, but who wants to drive aaaaall theeee waaaay back up there, plus it's not just up the street... Will give it another try as my roommates Philly Cheese Steak was perfection! Hopefully, we will have similar experiences as the positive reviews..."}
{"text":"I was a big Subway fan, until I tried Jersey Mikes, I eat here at least once a week..."}
{"text":"Damn. Was not expecting this place to be as good as it was. This isn't Subway people. Staff were awesome and legit one of the best sandwiches I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"We used to go here a lot. Food is good but the last visit will be our final visit to this location. Completely unacceptable to expect customers to wait while you prepare a catering order right at dinner time. In the short term it probably made sense to make a few hundred quick bucks, but long term it was a terrible decision. We used to spend $30-40 a week in that store and it became part of our weekend routine. Luckily, Swensons is right down the street and thanks to the kid working last Sunday, we got to try it for the first time. Swensons and my family thank you for not caring enough to take an order, that will be our new weekend stop."}
{"text":"If there's one place I crave a little too much, it's Jersey Mike's. I tried this place out sometime in April of this year for the first time and I basically refuse to go to any other sandwich place!   I normally get a #13 on wheat bread, Mike's way (sans the red wine vinegar) and it is such a great combination.   One of the beauties of Jersey Mike's is the amount of meat they put on your sandwich. Other places tend to be a little stingy, but I'd say you get your money's worth here!  They also have hot sandwiches such as Philly cheesesteaks, which are great too.   They offer 3 different sizes for most sandwiches (mini, regular and giant). The mini is definitely good for kids and a quick snack, the regular is more comparable to a 6-8 inch sandwich, while the giant is worth it for those with a big appetite or those wanting to share."}
{"text":"Was here when I spent a month in Cleveland for work, the training facility was a few blocks away, so one day for lunch we passed by and a friend mentioned them so we decided to stop, and dag nab it I'm glad we did!  Awesome sub shop! super fast and friend workers, OK amount of parking and great selections of food! GET THE SUBS DUH! They fresh cut your loaf of bread, meat, and cheese as you pick you toppings and condiments. Fresh, tasty and relatively cheap! The large size is really two sandwiches  so splitting one is can easily be done. If I'm every back  in Cleveland for work I plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"Great job, Jersey Mike's!  This location is the best.  There are many lunch options in Tega, but this is really among the best of them.  The place is clean and tidy. And the staff here is friendly, greeting you right when you walk in.  Although the place is often crazy-busy, the food quality is there and the order is done quickly."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I have to say I was unimpressed. That is just my opinion. I am sure most will call me crazy and it is not that I didn't like the sandwich I just thought it was ok. I have had better.  Now to clarify I am not a fan of the major sub chain. I don't go their Way at all. I am the Duke at my favorite sub shop. Now some people may not like that place and that is fine. That's what makes the world go around. If we all had the exact same opinion on everything life would be boring. But so far everyone I have taken there likes it. Even one person who had been to Jersey Mike's before liked it more.  I got the Original Italian on white bread regular size. I thought the bread was dry. The whole sandwich was dry to me but I like extra condiments on my sandwich. The meat was good and I like the fact that they slice it right in front of you but overall I was just not impressed.  I will not be disappointed if I never go back to Jersey Mike's again. Not because I hated it just because in my opinion there are must better places out there. I was even excited to try it because a lot of people talk about it. Maybe I just went on a bad day. But I tried it was not impressed enough to even give it maybe one more shot. I will stick with my favorite sub place. Maybe sometime in the future someone can talk me into trying Jersey Mike's again."}
{"text":"Very friendly and kind staff, Javi, especially showed exceptional customer service.   The subs are amazing and use wonderfully fresh bread and sandwich ingredients.  Jersey Mike's is my favorite sandwich place and I'll se sure to come back to this location especially."}
{"text":"Better than SUBWAY, not as good as FIREHOUSE. A little to pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Went there on memorial day, the place was empty. The girl making our subs seemed irritated that we were there. The music was so loud we had to shout at her and she needed to repeat herself many times. My husband ordered the meatball sub. It came wrapped and she didn't offer to put any toppings on it and we didn't feel like shouting at her again. It was very bland as well. I had a cold sub which was ok. When you go to swipe your card the first question is how much of a tip would you like to leave! Will stick with subway. Also the meat that was sliced was put on a bare table with no paper or plastic disposable covering. I hope they sanitize frequently."}
{"text":"Best experience I have ever had at any sub shop let alone jersey Mikes. Greg the manager was attentive and caring. I will drive the extra mile to this shop every time now"}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes is my husbands favorite.  Be prepared when you walk in, it smells horrible.  When I first noticed the smell and asked 'what the??...' I was informed it was sewer (not toilet, but drains). I'd rather drive the 10 minutes to the other location than worry how much of the smell is being infused into my husbands sandwich.   Also, when we've had to grab and go, out of the last three times, twice this location had no white bread."}
{"text":"Love all the other Jersey mikes. This one was was a disaster. Took soooo long mostly because the girl was too busy flirting with the previous customers who kept complimenting her on her retainer (really guys?) I was literally yelling not to put vinegar on the sandwich right in front of her but she was laughing with the other customers and soaking vinegar on it. the cook could not understand I wanted a grilled sandwich on bread not a wrap and had to unwrap my sandwich because she forgot stuff. Ordered a large drink and they gave me a small I just helped myself to switch it out. Only good thing was when I checked the recipt they forgot to charge for one of the subs and chips yay free food. I'll go to other locations from now on."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Jersey Mikes. This location opened a few months ago and is always booming! The bread is fresh, the meat and cheese it cut to order and the vegetables are crisp and perfect. The service has been great every time I've been. I always order my sammy Mike's way: lettuce, tomato, onion, oil, vinegar and seasoning. Just a killer sandwich shop....I'm a believer!"}
{"text":"Yep, they are fast, friendly and delicious. I finally got my Italian Sub in a Tub, Mike's Way. I was a happy little lady! The store is clean and bright. They make their own meats and cheeses, which is impressive. For a chain, and the fact that I'm a persnickity when it comes to any Italian food, it does the job. Subway, you have been replaced."}
{"text":"Quality meats are found here, and they are resting on a delicious submarine style bread loaf.   This is the best chain sub place around. My favorite is the ol big kahuna cheese steak. It is so cheesy and melty, and their meat has no trace of gristle. It's high quality."}
{"text":"These guys are really cool and personal.  Laid back environment and a great sandwich shop to eat in.  They even cook the cold cuts for me which is way above and beyond the call duty!"}
{"text":"OK,  This is the final word after my 2nd experience at Jersey Mike's.  I got the Chipolte Philly sub again and it fell way short. This time I did not waste the calories and only choked down half the sandwich.  Whoever made it went way overboard on the chipolte mayo or sauce they use and again the meat was lost in the colossal bread bath.  Been there twice and will NOT return. I sure hope the other sandwiches are better than the Philly, but I am not going for round 3 at this joint!"}
{"text":"Fresh meats. Sliced to order. Philly cheese steak grilled fresh. Just as good as POPs. Very clean and friendly service. A bit of a drive but will come back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get subs.  Came in for 3 giant subs one of which was the philly cheese steak with chipole mayo. The last time I looked phillycheese steak subs have onions in them so WHY DOES THIS STORE HAVE NO ONIONS???    And that's not the only subs that require onions. The other two giant italian combos i ordered get thin raw onions as well. How does the management not know it is running out of onions?   I had no choice but to get the philly cheese steak with only peppers and hope that the recipient doesn't mind.  It was disappointing to make a trip to this location and find out that they cannot make sandwichs as described on their menu."}
{"text":"Great service, subs are fresh and made how you like them.    Zak and Ashley were helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Extra meat ***** scam  It's best to go in. Don't order online.   You get charged 3$ more for extra meat.  Ok.   See pictures. Go to fry's and get 3$ worth of meat.  Measure it up.    So pictures are the key.  Yes I did. Extra meat vs regular. You decide.   I love jersey mikes. Will always go there. But things have changed from a year ago.    And to be clear. I am a fit athlete 185 lbs 6' tall male. 47 and ripped. So protein is essential.    Meat.  That extra charge to jersey mikes? I will pick up a 1/4 lb of meat at 3$.  And add.   Shameful.  And skimpy. 17.95$.   Let's compare.  Maggianos chicken parm.  3 breasts. Pasta and bread.  18.50.  And leftovers for days.    Wow. Scam."}
{"text":"Today my hubby and I had our first sandwiches from Jersey Mike's.  A medium Philly cheese, and the #2 medium,  chips and drinks were extra at a cost of over $6.00 just for those.  The whole bill with tax was $23 and change.  Yikes!  His sandwich was packed with meat.  The other sandwich was packed with lettuce.  The restaurant was freezing inside.    IF we go back......we will share a medium Philly, to go, and brink our own chips and drinks.  I gave 3 stars based on the fact that the restaurant was to cold to eat in, and pricing, and at least one sandwich was mostly lettuce."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this Jersey Mike's and their staff. I went in there and orders several subs during a dinner rush. When I got home, I realized that they had messed up on one of my subs (nothing major) , so I gave them a call and they took my name down for next time. The next time I came in, they comped my entire order! Talk about customer service! They were polite and professional both times. They made a loyal customer out of me...  The food is incredible too, make sure you try any of the cheesesteak subs."}
{"text":"Not only do I love Jersey Mikes, but I LOVE this location! Friendliest staff HANDS DOWN! I live right around the corner and come here very often because of how great the service is. If anyone is trying to find a new sandwich shop to become a regular at come here, you won't be disappointed! You guys ROCK! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Dirtiest place I've been to in awhile. The floors were filthy, as were the tables. However, the sandwich was ok. Won't be back though."}
{"text":"It is really good went there with my mother in law. Staff was so nice and the food was delicious I definitely will be back and bringing more people."}
{"text":"Always great food when my Fiancé and I eat there,never had a problem with anything we ordered from them any time we go to Charlotte"}
{"text":"Love this Sub shop and the location on Central and Camrlback.. 10/10 on customer service, 10/10 on food quality, 10/10 on facility cleanliness! This the place to be if you want awesome service and great food."}
{"text":"Could be the best sandwich shop in Las Vegas.  Many choices of hot and cold sandwiches. The bread is excellent and they are not chincy on the meats.   Service is quick.  Expectations are always met and I leave satisfied.  This is a staple in my lunch routine."}
{"text":"How do you run out of your signature relish during lunch on Sunday? That's the only reason to come. Otherwise the sandwiches are just ok."}
{"text":"i am picky with sandwich shops, mainly cuz the heavy skimping done by other brands out there. this specific location of jersey mikes in boca park tho never skimps on anything. i normally always get the italian mikes way with extra juice, i've never had a sandwich from this location that wasn't overflowing with delicious meat and toppings. i always seem to be greeted happily, and more then normally biting into it within minutes of ordering it.  most sandwich shops flood their sandwiches with veggies and sauces to give you that flavor boost, at jersey mikes its the meat that gives you this wonderful slap of flavor right across your face, the veggies just add onto the flavor of the meat, not mask it like others..."}
{"text":"The subs I loved when I was a kid at the Jersey Shore have now gone global!! I've been a fan of Jersey Mike's Subs since it was Mike's Subs In Pt Pleasant, NJ.  OK, the bread isn't from Baldanza's. Phoenix is a long way from Long Branch, NJ. However, it's fresh and stands up to the oil and vinegar. My recommendation: if you like Italian cold cuts, the #2 or the #5. The cheesesteaks are the best you're gonna find outside Geno's in Philadelphia. Unless it's a \"hot sub,\" ask for it \"Mike's Way.\" You'll be glad you did.  This isn't Subway. There are no $5 footlongs here. However, the sandwiches here are much larger and, unlike Subway, the only turkey cold cuts at Jersey Mike's is the turkey breast. The meats and cheeses are all sliced to order and their quality is first rate. You can taste the difference.   The employees are great. If you go in there more than a couple of times, they recognize you. They're great with kids. There are a couple of televisions (at least one is always tuned to \"Sportscenter\"). The soda is unlimited and they accept credit cards."}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place. Big fan of theirs from back east. Was happy to hear about this place but when I went inside to order, I left. I tried coming back a year later and walked out again. Both times, no one in there, place was messy, overpriced, and they were out of roast beef both times. Come on Mgmt, make changes there, otherwise, your business will continue to be slow. I had 2 friends eat there and they said it was mediocre."}
{"text":"The service was good, the subs tasted just like the ones I ate in Jersey. Much better than subway. They slice all the meat and cheese when you order the sub, and you can definitely taste the fresh difference!"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and staying at the nearby  Hyatt  when I found this place on YELP.  Got there at noon and the place was PACKED but the line moved quickly and everyone was courteous and downright pleasant. Got the roast beef and provolone on wheat - custom toppings to my likings and it was delish!  Real roast beef sliced in the spot ! Yelp reviews did not disappoint ! My only suggestion would be to add a multigrain or oat bread option - but otherwise super good, inexpensive and quick. What a gold mine !"}
{"text":"Today was my first time there. I don't know if it cause I'm a fat ass or the food is just so good, but I wanna come back for dinner!! I ordered food for 3 people. I got the #43 Chipotle Cheese Steak...I can't even tell you all of the emotions my taste buds felt eating this sandwich.It came with a sauce that was neither spicy nor bland, filled with grilled onions that kept everyone away from me at the office the rest of the day. I had regular size on white with chips & a cookie (which I wish was a little bigger but I'm not complaining too much). The description on the menu was to the \"t\"...you gotta try one :) I'll see you guys later."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak in the area. The sandwiches are delicious even the most basic ones lol. This is my to go place for subs :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! ! Food is VERY  fresh and delicious. And the employees are fantastic.  Great personalities.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is the second time I visited this location and was dissatisfied and disappointed in the service. It seems like there is lack of supervision at this location. The first time I was there, an employee bad mouthed a customer who had just left in front of us customers. This past time, the sandwich that I received was about half the turkey that I normally get. I will not be going back here again."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sandwich shop. My parents owned a Subway franchise and I grew up making sandwiches and waiting on customers. I have eaten Subway my whole life up until the point I found Jersey Mike's. The sandwich is simple not too many fixings and it just comes together perfectly. Sometimes I eat there twice in a day and rack up my points 4 a free sandwich. Tuesday is double Point day so I try to make it there on that day but any day is a good day to go get a Jersey Mike's Sub. Thank you so much for the nice staff they even know my sandwich by heart when I go in there. That's why I keep coming back every day and get a number 9. Always with the bacon."}
{"text":"Stopped at this location for the first time today.  The menu here seems a bit limited.  Really didn't have anything that appealed to me since it was about the same as Subway.  I finally ordered the meatball and cheese sub.  Not sure but it appeared there were two meatballs cut in quarters, buried and overwhelmed by the bread.  The meatballs were okay.  There just wasn't enough of them.  The bread was very good.  Just too much of it.  Overall, it was just another meatball sub.  Nothing outstanding about it.  Jimmy John's is so much better and they have a better selection to chose from."}
{"text":"Any deli shop in AZ that has capicola ham deserves some stars.  They have a good selection of sandwiches and chips.  Just shows how much Subway is losing it brand when these spots are popping up and you come in and leave very refreshed that there are better options"}
{"text":"Nicely renovated sub shop.  Great sandwiches and very nice owner.  I definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"I really like there sandwiches when they're done right unfortunately this particular jersey mikes never seems to get it right, at least for me. The last 6-7 times I've been there they have in some way made my sandwich wrong."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to the Jersey shore on vacation every year, so we gave this place a try.  It's great!  I had the cheesesteak.  The meat and cheese was perfect, and the bread was fresh and delicious.  My wife had the Original Italian, and loved it.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My fave \"chain\" sub place. I'm a cold sub sandwich guy...usually order the sub club with turkey and roast beef + all fixins. Crew is helpful and friendly. Ingredients, meat, bread and condiments are just a cut Above the rest in my experience. Have eaten at various locations in AZ and Socal and my experiences have been consistently good. Only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is I feel the price is a bit high. Beats places like subway hands down though."}
{"text":"This is actually a review for the place in Westlake...I love the subs! I do have to say though, the staff at this particular store is so not friendly! I go in and feel as though they're doing me a favor by waiting on me...ugh! Maybe because I don't tip??? I don't feel it's the type of place that a tip is necessary unless perhaps I was having my sub there, but take out? Sorry...it's no different than any other spot you go to for a quick something on the run. Should we tip at McDonalds too? This industry is all about being able to connect with the public...customer service! If you feel like your owed more than your paycheck, then maybe you're in the wrong biz or perhaps if you'd perform above & beyond, be a standout in performance enough that someone might notice? As far as the company...great subs but maybe time to expand. Fresh cut fries, salads and or great soup!!! That would be perfection...full meal service with great subs!"}
{"text":"I love the number 13 Italian sub Mike's way with the red wine vinegar and spices they customize my girlfriend sandwich so she gets it the way she likes it everything taste so fresh and I can order online and pick it up without standing in line"}
{"text":"WHO IS THE MANAGER OF THIS LOCATION? You need to step your game up   I went in today, Jan 25th at 12:40PM, and there was ONE girl ((younger with a dermal piercing)) busting her ass while an older shorter lady made and ate her sandwich on the line ... meaning she had gloves on and was eating. She then went to the back where she continued to eat And the younger girl had to ask her for help. WHILE STILL CHEWING older lady asked what I wanted on my sandwich. I HONEST TO GOD LOS MY APPETITE.   I have been to this location several times. And it always seems one person is busting their ass while others stand and watch.   Get it together management!!'"}
{"text":"Having grown up down the street from the original Jersey Mike's on Arnold Avenue in Point Pleasant, NJ I know exactly how a \"Mike's Sub\" is supposed to look, taste and be assembled.  What this Jersey Mike's franchise did was exactly what I knew Jersey Mike's to be.  The bread could not have been fresher, the build was perfect and the staff, especially the manager who served us and constructed our Jersey shore delicacy was exceptionally friendy and professional.  If you're from the Jersey shore, don't hesitate to call this location home... we certainly didn't.  And yes, #11 still reigns."}
{"text":"Very tasty fresh sandwiches prepared by friendly employees. Slightly overpriced but just a little bit. The only think I omit is the vinegar and oil they douse the sandwiches with, as it makes them soggy."}
{"text":"We are here last Wednesday for a quick lunch and I have to say how impressed we were with the service and how friendly everyone was. The guy who was making our sandwiches was very engaging and asking us all types of questions about where we were from and what we did. You could tell he really enjoyed his job and talking with people. It's not very often that you come across a business like this where everyone seems to be in a good mood and smiling and happy to work, with the public. Food was excellent, as it always is at jersey mikes, but this was an exceptional service that needs to be recognized :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Jersey Mike's subs. I arrived at 2 pm and there were 4 people in the line. I ordered the Philly cheesesteak sub and I waited 15 minutes for my sub and to pay. There were only 2 workers in the store. One was taking orders and starting them while the other finished the subs and took payments. They were trying to move quickly but it was obvious that they were understaffed. The line continued to grow as I waited and I was relieved that I wasn't in a hurry to get back to work. I took my sub to go and when  I finally got to eat it my enjoyment was short lived when I realized I paid $8.50 for a little meat and cheese on bread. Don't believe the hype about this chain. It is definitely a corporate run business with average food."}
{"text":"These are the closest I've found to a true hoagie!  I miss my hoagies more than anything and this was a good substitute.  Could of used a little more vinegar and a little more oil, but that makes for a soggy sandwich."}
{"text":"If you want an amazing sandwich, get the regular size turkey but add bacon. Get it Mike's way but ask for pickles (if you like them because they don't come on it).   If taking it to go ask for the oil & vinegar in a to-go cup (bread can get soggy if not eaten quick once it's added).  I went to them for lunch at least once a week for a couple of years when I lived in Oregon, was so happy to find one close to my new place here in Arizona.  Seriously one of the best Sub Sandwich places I've ever eaten at."}
{"text":"My wife loves how fresh the meat tastes and their pepperoncinis.  I love how close they are to my house and the heartiness after eating a full sub.  A little pricier than subway, but the reason is the quality of the meats I believe.  Therefore, this is somewhere to stop by for a quick lunch or dinner.  Helpful staff and overall great food.  We will see you again Jersey Mike!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes is one of my favorite sub spots along with Jimmy Johns. They're friendly, all the sandwiches are fresh cut in front of you (meat & cheese)...loads of topping options, and decently priced. Lucky for me, I have one close to my work. They even have a coupon text program that they send out weekly! They'll do catering for you too!"}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mikes. No matter what location I go to, I get excellent and prompt customer service. Their subs are to die for. Always fresh cut meats right on the spot and the customer service is amazing. They really hire the most delightful people here. I will remain a loyal customer for life."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying these guys in here are so unprofessional and just seem like they're dicking around majority of the time BUT strangely it's comical. They talk to you like you are not a customer, talk to each other like they're brothers, clean and talk about money at all the wrong times. I've been to a ton of Jersey Mikes and for some reason they made my sandwich SO GOOD. I asked for my deli meat to be heated up and they melted the cheese on top just perfectly. I can't get over how good they made it. This with the side comedy is just what I needed during a Christmas shopping break."}
{"text":"I LOVE Jersey Mikes!! One of my favorite sandwich places to go. LOVE their oil and vinegar!"}
{"text":"Just had my first sub from Jersey Mike's and have a split opinion. My sandwich tasted good and had good service. The roll on my sub was very good. Everyone keeps comparing this place to Jimmy John's. So it tasted better than Jimmy John's but the size was small. I ordered a medium thinking that should be a good size. Their giant was $14.30 and thought that must be huge but the medium was close to a small from most places. It cost $8.45 plus tax so it was over $9. And the meat when their making it looks like a lot but you're fooled because it's sliced very thin. So it's close to Jimmy John's but doesn't beat but maybe a little better. Firehouse subs is still on the top unless someone can tell me of another restaurant to try?   For the older folks I bet you can remember a great sub shop with big sandwiches at a good price? I have a few favorites but their 400 miles away."}
{"text":"Good location, nice interior, the sub is what you expect, and there appears to be wifi available. HOWEVER, there is one employee who is almost literally screaming in a non-stop 'friendly' chatter with the line of customers being served. I suppose many of the regulars like it, but trust me--it only serves to make the restaurant a noisy, hard-to-talk place that just isn't pleasant. Someone needs to tell this friendly woman to stop SCREAMING, turn it down 30 decibels, and then everyone wins. If it weren't for her I'd give this location a higher rating."}
{"text":"We came here because we got coupons in the mail. When my wife and I got the food to go we noticed that their menu is way overpriced compared to similar sub shops. When we got home, we realized the food was greasy and that my hot meat was not drained, so all the juices soaked the bread to the point of falling apart. They had messed up both my wife and my order (putting toppings we hadn't asked for, and omitting ones we had). Finally, the teenagers working there were more concerned with flirting with each other behind the counter than actually helping customers. That's probably why it took over 10 minutes to get our sandwiches when there was no one in front of us. You want a better place? Check out Capriotti's down the street, Subway across the street, or Port of Subs at the other end of the same center."}
{"text":"The worst chicken parm sandwich I've ever had in my life.  The food wasn't fresh,  it was microwave chicken...  The place was dirty.  I'm never going back again.  Being from New York I was looking forward to enjoying some good food and I was let down."}
{"text":"So, my son and I are doing a, \"Sub Tour\" this Summer in  search of what we consider to be the best-testing chain sub.  We have been to DiBella's, Jimmy Johns, Dave's Cosmic Subs, Jersey Mike's and Potbelly.  But first, a fair review of Jersey Mike's.  What I love is the fresh-sliced turkey and the option for a mini sub.  Finally someone who doesn't shove an 8\" sub in your face and say sorry, that is the smallest sub we have.  I would say the bread is the worst tasting of all the places we have been ...very blah and tastes slightly chemical.  But overall, lots of options for chicken-based sandwiches, hot subs and wraps so thumbs up for that.  Now, my ranking?  DiBella's (hello everything sub bread...yum), Dave's, Potbelly, Jersey Mike's and Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Best sub shop EVER! Generous with the toppings and the staff is so friendly! Gary the owner always makes the best suggestions if you're stuck on what to order and makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"Terrible food. I ordered a Buffalo Chicken wrap and they gave me lettuce and chicken and squirted some Buffalo sauce on it. Nothing that cannot be done at home in less than 5 mins. It's worse than subway and more expensive."}
{"text":"5 stars is crazy but so are these subs. I had never had Jersey Mike's before until a few weeks ago but holy cow...please get it Mike's way too. The herbs, oil, vinegar, whatever else they put on it is what really makes this place unique. Sure you can go to one of those other sub places and get a $5 footlong, but why when you can spend only a few bucks more for something 10 times better? Do yourself a favor and GO!! I'll be going tomorrow. :)"}
{"text":"Very well done . This is how subs should taste . No wonder they took over an old subway location . Subway / jimmy John taste like stale bread and a pound of shredded lettuce , zero taste.... . Mike's is awesome , glad it is here ."}
{"text":"I have lived in Pittsburgh for two years now and have been told by many locals that Jersey Mike's is super solid. I ordered their classic Italian sub and was not impressed. Definitely better than subway or get go but nothing to brag about. The bread was fine, I thought the deli meat lacked flavor. Most of the tables were empty and dirty while the employees carried on in the back. What really makes me disgusted is that I paid 18.00 and some odd change for a large, mediocre sub and terrible tasting fountain drink with non carbonation."}
{"text":"Tasty, toasty subs!!!!  I've just had my first Jersey Mike sub and it was drippingly delicious!!  This spot just opened, i think this week, and it was busy for lunch, but we were in & out in just a couple minutes.  They slice the meat right in front of you and the bread is soft & fresh.  This ain't no Subway!!!    i highly recommend the Pastrami Reuben, love that dressing, and, Sauerkraut?  unbelieveable!  just wish there was more of everything :-)"}
{"text":"I had the Big kahuna Cheese Steak on white bread, its a pretty good sandwich, I like Philly Cheese Steaks, buts it hard to find good places close to  the south end of town, I have tried Hanks, Capriottis and a few other places in the Silverado Ranch area but this is one of the better places on this side of town since Hougan's Racing sandwich shop closed down. The bread was fresh and soft, the steak , cheese, mushrooms, onions, jalapenos were all done right. This place will be my Philly fix on this side of town."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed when I come to this location. I always get the same sandwich (#9) so I never venture out but it's always delicious. Exactly what I come in for. The employees have always been nice and move rather quickly so we don't have to wait long. They heated up my deli meat when I was pregnant with no problem and I appreciated that."}
{"text":"This was my first time. I was very pleased with the service, food and the value. The bread is soft with just enough firmness to hold this monster together. The meat is sliced fresh for your order. They have a great vinegar oil mix that compliments the sandwich well. I wil be Namco for more."}
{"text":"My 4/5 rating applies to Jersey Mikes as it compares to other sandwich chains.   As a New Yorker living in Madison for nearly a decade, I have long suffered that Madison has no real sandwich shops. Sure, there are plenty of places that make ok sandwiches, but these are all most likely restaurants with big menus. There are no real east coast style delis.   As far as sandwich chains go, Subway is hot garbage. Quiznos isn't far behind. Same goes for Cousins. I guess Potbellys and Which Which are ok, but they all lack that fresh, full deli sandwich vibe.   While I can't in good conscience compare a large chain to the brilliance of an authentic local deli, Jersey Mikes is the only sandwich chain worth eating at. The long rolls are deli quality, and they use fresh cut sandwich meat like the kind you SHOULD be getting at the deli counter at your local grocery.   We've trekked from the east side (about 25 mins drive each way) on a lazy Saturday/Sunday a few times in the short time they've been open, just to get a quick solid sandwich.   Owner of this franchise seems like a good dude. Staff has always shown fantastic hustle when I've stopped in."}
{"text":"As I was eating my sandwich from here for dinner last night I remembered how I am amazed a sandwich that tastes so good comes from a chain. Jersey Mike's can't be compared at all with Subway or Port of Subs. I had the Original Italian and it tasted great. One time at band camp... oops I mean at Subway they were out of every bread except for wheat so I went with it and surprisingly liked it so I asked for wheat bread this last time and really liked it. The workers are cool and make your food in front of you and get it out quick. You can sign up for their rewards program and earn free food with purchases."}
{"text":"This location recently closed for a brief time and has reopened under new management. I have been in a few times since the change and it's been a much better experience. I used to come by a lot and liked the previous owner and his son but they really let things go in the end sadly. The current people working were really nice and made my sandwich just the way I asked. The giant size can easily be shared with someone else or used for 2 meals. My favorite sandwich is the Original Italian and I get it Mike's Way with the addition of mayonnaise. They take coupons here and run different specials. Having the shore rewards is a nice thing if you eat here often because you can get a free sandwich or wrap after so many purchases. I'm glad that the rewards program is still around and hasn't changed. I decided to do a review update so others know about the change in owners, quality of the food and service and that they are finally back open."}
{"text":"I have eaten here and my company has ordered lunch from this place too.  I have always wondered if they are located in Jersey?  I will have to check that out now that I think about it.  The other thing too is that when I think of Jersey I think of a friend who got in trouble bootlegging cigarettes.  LOL Now to the food I just had a number 13 without tomatoes.  It was really good.  I like the vinegar and oil they apply to the sandwich.  I did get the two cookies as a side.  One was peanut butter which was a real treat since people afraid of peanuts.  (I remember I was on a flight coming back from St Thomas and a passenger who was allergic to peanuts told the flight crew.  Then I did not get my free peanuts.) I will get back on track.  The other cookie was a chocolate chip.  I did not care for it.  It was good, but hard like a chips ahoy.  Not my favourite style.  A chocolate chip cookie should be soft."}
{"text":"First time here at Jersey Mike's. Blows that normal sub shop out of the water. Restaurant was clean, fast and well worth the stop."}
{"text":"This is the Jersey MIke's by my house.  I go three frequently. At least 2-3 times a wee. I get the #18 /Mikes way. The staff there is friendly and efficient.  I've not had a bad experience yet. I also enjoy the extra perks like getting the e-mails with coupons/deals in them and additionally getting points towards a reward."}
{"text":"This location is always great. Speedy service. Employees there have a positive attitude and nice. Thanks for a job well done."}
{"text":"I would suggest you try this place before you except the one-star rating. To me this is the best Jersey Mike's and makes one of the top 3 Philly steak sandwiches in town, the other two are miles away. Have always gotten excellence sandwiches.  it is MY sandwich shop other choice."}
{"text":"I come in to this location all the time. They are always super busy being an uptown location compared to other Charlotte locations. I have to admit that they get a lot of customers at this location that are not the nicest people. Alot of riff-raff in the uptown area brings a lot of different people to this store, and some of the customers are just plain mean, rude, and bitter people. The staff always handles customers with respect and care and I've personally seen them make sure that their customers orders are correct before the customers leave the store. I see the clientele and people that the employees have to deal with at this location on a daily basis and I have to give the management team and the rest of the staff credit for maintaining professionalism when dealing with those guests. They put up with a lot ( homeless people, thugs, obnoxious guests, etc). Not only does this location have the best food out of all the local options, they also have an extremely patient and professional staff. Been a customer for a long time, and plan on continuing to visit this location. I recommend everyone check out this Jersey Mikes, just beware of some of the wacky customers you may encounter."}
{"text":"Zero for what I received at my order. Zero for what I received for my comment. Congratulations! Your service sucks and your customer service sucks!"}
{"text":"I have been getting these sandwhiches since I was 11!  The number 9 Mike's way is the WAY to go.  Other than that I really love the staff here.  Always friendly and make excellent sandwiches (some locations make better than others)!  Thanks guys!  Also if you want to try them for lunch pre order online.  Can't stand lines and it's waiting for me right when I specify I'll be their to pick it up."}
{"text":"Subs are great. Kinda pricy for subs, but at least it's fresh cut. Service is very slow. Some of the help don't seem to know what they are doing."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and they where super Unorganized all over the place .. mixing up orders left and right ..more experienced fellow was Curtis .. Everyone else blaming each other . An oh messy tables ."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were good and service was good. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Fresh-cut meats on fresh-baked bread, Mike's way. The subs here aren't that inventive but the meat makes the taste better than competitors like Subway or Scholotzsky's. BF swears by their Italian, and a Giant size will set you back $14, which to me is absurd for a sandwich. But it's over a foot long, so...  Service at this location is a bit hit or miss. Their open sign is never on, but they have one on the front window...with the cord hanging down, not plugged into anything. Totally bizarre."}
{"text":"I love these Subs!!!  The Italian Mikes way is the best!!  Large Subs, twice the size of the competitors.  Can not go wrong here.  Sometime the Customer Service can be a little cold but they still do it right!"}
{"text":"The recently added tip screen on the merchant terminal is a bit uncomfortable...   I love the sandwiches but the tip thing always ruins the dining experience, makes me feel so uncomfortable, I always think twice before choose a lunch/dinner spot.  As an individually owned and operated business, tipping is at the discretion of each franchise owner.  The tipping option at the terminal is customizable so the owner can enable it or disable it as best suits their business model, I would suggest disabling it...  Services rendered by the employee for an individual order to go doesn't justify a request for a tip and places the paying customer in an uncomfortable position.........I'll return when it changes...."}
{"text":"The customer service here is great, they definitely hired the greatest people. The atmosphere is very cozy and clean. The prices, quality, and taste is also great. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Greats subs made with high quality ingredients. Always made quick so you can get back on your way. Or sit down in their clean eatting area and watch some tv. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My friend tried to go in today and was refused service due to having her service dog with her. Learn the law and educate your staff!"}
{"text":"A tad pricier than other sandwich places, but here's the reason!  Quality, Quality, Quality...It's refreshing to go a sandwich shop where they really Care about putting out top notch products!  I love the old school way of custom slicing the meat for every sandwich versus the competition.  Bread is always fresh, and the produce is always in nice looking condition, and consistently replenished.  By far the best of the large scale Sandwich franchises!  I've eaten here 100's of times and have never received a bad sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place is great. This is my first time here. Employees are very friendly and nice. The place is very clean. They were fast. Most importantly my meatball sandwich is fantastic and HUGE. My boyfriend said his club sub is great as well. The meat is great. As I was writing this a worker came over to make sure our sandwiches were good. They are so great here! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had them for the first time recently. Went there back to back days it was so good! Only had the cheese steak but it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Nothing special at this sub shop compared to the competition (Uncle Sam's, Blimpies, etc). The staff was friendly and the store was clean.  Major parking problem at this location."}
{"text":"I came to know this place because my boy suggested we stop by here for lunch the other day. My first impression? It was simple, clean, and humble. I got the club sandwich \"Mikes Way\" and to be honest I was very surprised at the amount of flavor it kicked. So here is a break down of my experience.  Pros: 1. The place was clean and homey. 2. The employees were courteous and polite. 3. The food was actually really good and didn't have the gritty industrialized taste like Subway sandwiches have. Very fresh and everything is prepared in front of you, even the meat is sliced to order.  Cons: 1. They overdid the sauce.   If you are not aware what \"Mikes Way\" is, it is the option of getting olive oil, vinaigrette, onion, tomato, lettuce, and different herbs and spices in your sandwich. It is delicious, so don't get me wrong when I complain about this. However they over oiled my sandwich causing it to go very soggy, very fast. By the time I finished a half of my sandwich and moved to the other, it was falling apart like no ones business. It became a hassle to eat the other half. This is the only negative thing I could find about this place hence 4 stars instead of 5 stars. Over all the experience was fantastic but make sure if you ask for \"Mikes Way\" to ask them to go easy on the sauce."}
{"text":"Just got a club sub and there was no lettuce, tomato, onion oil vinegar nothing I ordered a # 8 , it clearly says on the sign it comes with mikes  way or whatever, I'm done with jersey mikes"}
{"text":"The standard Jersey Mike's Italian sub. Tastes good and it's fresh but is very messy especially when trying to eat in a suit"}
{"text":"Have visited twice and waited an unnecessarily long time on both visits. I know the location is new and they are still figuring things out but I doubt I will give them another chance after my last visit.   I ordered online and was told to arrive at 6:50 for my order. I showed up a few minutes after. Not only did I stand at the register while the guy at the counter continued to take people from the other line (when you order online, you're told you can skip the line..not true in my case), once I was helped, they hadn't even started making my order! They had it in their system but did nothing with it until I arrived. So I waited 5 minutes and they hand me one of the subs in my order. I ask about the other one and they look at me like I had two heads. So I waited another 7 minutes and finally got my order, almost 20 mins after the promised time. Another person came in after me to pick up his online order and suffered the same experience. The manager on duty offered no explanation or even an apology.   Bottom line...don't come here if you value your time and money. Horrible service, overpriced and very inefficient operation."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good and made quickly. They're a little on the spendy side if you don't have coupons."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Their bread is good.  The selection of sandwiches is awesome.  I only get the tuna and it's AMAZING.  The staff behind the counter always appear chipper and happy to make your sandwich."}
{"text":"Easily the cleanest Jersey Mikes I have ever been to. Food is outstanding and the staff is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"T Not greeted when I came in the door. Not thank you did when I left. All but one booth was not wipe down. 3 guys myself and a lady with her two daughters were the only ones in the store. One guy look to be doing some bookkeeping or something on the ledger. Seemed very unorganized. Debit machine was not working. As a young lady with long legs was walking across the parking lot to come into the store one guy whistled. All three of them had a short conversation about her attributes. They did run debit card to cash register and it went through. The card was thrown across the counter at me. The woman with her two daughters it in line front of me they seem to have a very hard time to charge her. She finally says I don't want it but I'll just take it that way. For customer service I would have given this a point n0  stars. For the food I give it four stars. Unlikely to return."}
{"text":"WARNING: High possibility of instant addiction to these samiches!!!   I visit this store at least twice per month and I've never been there and witnessed it being anything but very clean. Service is always great, they never fail to greet you immediately upon walking through the door. I've actually called them like 20 minutes before closing time before and asked them to make my sandwiches for pick up, not intentionally cutting it that close to them closing, but nevertheless, they still never treated me like they were upset or anything. The manager there has always been super friendly and strives to make sure you are fully satisfied with your food. Now for the food..... if you have never had Jersey Mike's, I must tell you that this is NOTHING like Subway. You won't see any pre-cut cold cuts or little card board trays with portioned out pre-cooked steak. Your meats and cheeses will be fresh and sliced right in front of you upon ordering your sandwich. If you get a hot sandwich, like their awesome steak and cheese sub, they will be cooking your steak on the grill while you wait....hot, fresh, and delicious!! The giant sub is twice the size of a regular, but a better deal, so I always get the giant. These sandwiches are big, they do not skimp on the meat and cheese, again, NOTHING like Subway! Two giant club subs were more than enough to feed me, my husband and 18 year old son tonight for dinner and we still had half of one of the sandwiches left over. And we were all three stuffed!! We never have room left to bother ordering chips, and don't be fooled,  we three can put away some food! Once you've had Jersey Mike's, you will never want to visit another Subway again. There's such a remarkable difference in TRULY fresh food. Oh and I forgot to mention, when you order a giant sub, they automatically cut it into 4 sections for you, so that makes it easier to handle and enjoy! I paid $25 and change for the two big honking giant club subs I bought tonight for dinner, which will also provide lunch for my son tomorrow!!! Not bad at all for the quantity and quality of food you get here!!"}
{"text":"I tried Jersey Mike's today.   The reuben I ordered was on a hoagie style roll rather than regular rye bread.  While a different presentation than expected the sandwich was good.  The sandwich was  otherwise not noteworthy.  Service was a little slow but acceptable.   If you are in the neighborhood and need a sandwich Jersey Mike's will come through for you.  If looking for a great deli experience this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"I dont understand what makes this place so highly rated. The interior is run down. The employees act immature and call you \"dude\". Seriously? The sandwiches are on par with Subway. This place is just your average sandwich shop and they dont do a good job at it either."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is probably one of the best if not the best chain sub shops in Charlotte. The meats and breads are always freshly sliced and super tasty. This particular store is very well ran. The staff is extremely friendly. They are always polite, professional, and fast."}
{"text":"It's the Vegas airport....so EVERYTHING is more expensive.  2 regular sandwiches normally costs around $18 at any other JMs but here it's almost $25. The bread they use is brought in from outside the airport so don't be surprised if it's not exactly fresh. The attitude of the employees are what you'd expect for a fast-ish food place at the airport....not exactly the cream of the crop. Don't let the airport JMs give you the impression this is what all their locations are like.  It's the Vegas airport.....so \"meh. I've experience better\" is an apt review."}
{"text":"I dig Jersey Mikes, I just always seem to get stuck behind the person ordering 35 sandwiches for their entire office. Why not call a big order like that in ahead of time or order it on line so I do t have to stand in line for 25 minutes listening to you \"yay\" or \"nay\" every ingredient for all 200 sandwiches. It puts all the employees in the weeds and causes a line out the door behind you."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Jersey Mike's in town. Not only are the employees extremely nice and treat you like family but they take pride in making your sandwich. I always choose this Jersey Mike's over any other due to the excellent customer service I'm always given."}
{"text":"I went to Jersey Mike's today, it wasn't busy and the staff were all occupied doing everything but assisting customers, except for one girl taking orders and slicing meats. she had four sandwiches with meat lined up by no one making them after that assembly. They do slice the meat much thinner than others I've gone to. Doubt I'll go back for a while. Concord Mills piles it on!!!"}
{"text":"oday I visited Jersey Mikes University area. For those of us who patronize Jerseye in for a long day my friend\"......then the preparer looked at me and ask \"WHAT DO YOU WANT\"!!!  Stunned..... i looked at the gentleman who cut the sandwich and he said he's just tired......he attended the Panthers Game last night....as if that was an excuse. I said well I have never been exposed to such attitude from JM's staff member before so I will just be quite. The preparer replied by saying I wasn't giving you attitude and he didn't apologize. So...my experience here is certainly one I will not forget and please know I am firm believer in NOT spending hard earned money in a place which doesn't extend good customer service or at least apologize to a paying customer when bad service happens"}
{"text":"This rating is not about Jersey Mikes but about this location. I love Jersey Mikes subs, but will not order from this location again. The staff at this location was absolutely horrible. My #13 with no cooked ham but add turkey had both cooked ham and turkey. Why? Because the cutter was too busy talking to his co workers about a customer who just left. My Mikes way no onion, no tomato, light mayo wth yellow mustard was initially made with no yellow mustard.....when mustard was added there was a spot in the middle. As I asked to have my sandwich heated the preparer,who too was engaged in conversation with cutter, slid my sandwich over as if I wasn't asking to have the sandwich warmed. This isn't the first time I've had this issue here but it will be the last. I waisted time and money today because gossip and lack of attention to a paying customer got in the way."}
{"text":"Always friendly, helpful, fantastic service from this place. The food has never disappointed, either. Too many sub places have come and gone in surprise but I'm hoping this one will stay. When I need my sub fix, this is the place to go. Pleasantly surprised by the portions, service and taste for both cold and hot subs!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery ... called for 30 minutes to update my Yelp order... no answer... never delivered my order. Should have ordered Jimmy Johns"}
{"text":"2nd time back since the grand opening. Great customer EXPERIENCE fr the moment we walked through the door! Special Thanks to LaToya, B, and Q. Definitely will back, especially on Monday's!"}
{"text":"I love the chipotle mayo on mycheesesteak."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last couple months. The second time I was getting three subs for me and two other people. Two were giant Jersey Shore's Favorites but did not get them \"Mikes Way\". Had lettuce and mayo on one; lettuce, mayo, and tomatoes on the other. This sub was a  regular and I got it \"Mikes Way.\" First person politely told me I can order online in the future and they would be ready when I got there. The woman right before the cashier repeatedly told me that I should of ordered online before I came if I'm going to get three subs. After I paid she said next time order online. I just make sure there is not a next time and go somewhere else that wont complain if I order three subs. There are many other options in the area and many that are better. The first time I went my food was good but the last time the bread was dry and seemed like it was very old and would not stay together."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to have amazing customer service and a awesome meal, u will make sure all my coworkers know where to go for an amazing meal"}
{"text":"Geesh. This place gets packed at lunch! Thank goodness this location takes online orders! That's normally what I do...so I can just walk in cut the line and pick up my sandwich. But if you do try to go during the lunch rush my only advice is to go early!   So my favorite thing about the place? The bread. I'm not sure what makes it so good but I absolutely love it.   And what's my favorite sandwich? That's easy it's the #13 Original Italian which comes with provolone, ham, prosciuttini, cappacuolo, salami, and pepperoni. Top it any way you like and it's delicious!   The service has always been good so I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"We come for the good sandwiches, but the service on a Sunday after church is horrible. Got there about 12:45 and It took about 30 minutes to get our 4 sandwiches, and then one was wrong. I will not come again on a Sunday, TOO slow. Staff was polite, but slow, slow, slow!"}
{"text":"The bomb dot com  They shave their deli meats to order at JM's so all the meat is fresh.   I've been here thousands of times and the quality is always primo. The odd times where it wasn't as spectacular as usual, it's always the bread's fault. However,  very rarely is the bread stale or been sitting out too long.   I always get the Italian; Mike's Way. It rocks.   I've had the turkey and the philly steak before and they're both good too.   The one downside is the price. A giant can be $14.. which is the most expensive of all the sandwich shops like subway, firehouse, port of subs, capriotti's etc... I pay it willingly knowing I'm getting the best product. I'm also part of the rewards program which gets me a free giant every 144 points.   Best Italian sandwich in the valley."}
{"text":"This spot is the best. Great attention, always with a smile, courteous and friendly and I even had a philly with pepper jack cheese! Never been able to get that elsewhere at a Jersey Mike's...what a great experience I had. No complaints, only compliments. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill , the veggies arent fresh and the dining area is filthy , no longer comings here."}
{"text":"Awesome subs and great staff! Everyone is fast and friendly and the sandwiches are delicious!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Los Angeles and I'm so glad that they have Jersey Mike's Subs in AZ. One of my favorite sandwich franchise. I always get The Original Italian #13. Can't go wrong! Also today I got a free sandwich due to the free members club. Terrific!"}
{"text":"Whoever likes subway may not like this place. Jersey mike's cut, cooks, & prepare to order, no chilled meat bins here. The sandwiches has the right amount of everything. No one condiment or topping will over power you sandwich of choice. I always recommend getting the sandwiches done \"Mike's way\". It's tomatoes, lettuce, red wine vinegar, olive oil, herbs and salt&pepper. You don't really need more than that."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place as it's close by and fresh however for some reason the food just doesn't do it for me? I have tried a few different sandwich types and there is just something missing taste wise.  I like the fact that they slice the meats and cheese to order, however the toppings are pretty basic.  And the kicker is they are pretty pricy in comparison to other sub shops( two medium sandwiches chips and drinks were $20).  Overall like mentioned A + for the fresh sliced cold cuts but that is the extent of my praise."}
{"text":"Located conveniently off of the 215 and Flamingo Rd, this Jersey Mike's has the nicest, friendliest staff ever! I come in for lunch a couple times a month since my office is located close by. I usually see the same young men working behind the counter. They've always been so nice and professional. The sandwiches are always great but having a friendly staff makes the experience better."}
{"text":"I was in a bad mood today, but that changed after my experience at this place. We went in at two o'clock and the people working were so nice, smiling, and there was an overall great energy and atmosphere. This being my first time in a jersey mikes, I wasn't sure what to expect but was given a wonderful experience. I had the super sub, which was awesome and fun to watch them slice the cheese and meat. Boyfriend had the famous cheese steak, and he loved it, and he is a cheese steak snob! I will be back again VERY soon."}
{"text":"I always come in while its rush hour lunch time. But do they still try to talk to you and boy how fast they make your sandwich even tho there's 20 people in line. Love this place! Food is always hot and everyone is always in a good mood! Always come back and back! Take my money!!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this since it's new in Great Southern. Definitely regret that decision, I would definitely stick to the cold subs. My girlfriend got a turkey and swiss pita I believe. It certainly wasn't memorable as it was, at best, low quality deli meat and ordinary cheese. I made the mistake of getting a chicken parm sub. This was quite possibly the worst chicken parm I've ever had. The bread was bland (I'm picky when it comes to this, as Breadworks has spoiled me) and I honestly don't know how the chicken was originally cooked, but it definitely wasn't cooked the proper way. It had a fleshy feeling to it and I had a very bad stomach ache after consuming it. I will never go back here and would advise anyone in that area to either go to Mike and Tony's, Arby's, or the Mexican place by GNC. Be warned, never get a warm sub from this place as terrible bowl movements and a whole lot of regret will be the only outcome."}
{"text":"Excellent!  We got a large sub and split it between the two of us. Halfway through an employee came over and offered my son a cookie.  Very nice people and delicious food.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"My past two visits have been extremely disappointing. Today's visit was for takeout and I ordered a #6 Roast beef and provolone and the sandwich had very little beef. Tons of lettuce, little meat. I did notice the place was extremely busy and the young woman doing the slicing (black glasses) was extremely fast but inattentive to quality. My prior visit last week was equally disappointing in that the same sandwich was ordered but forgot to add mayonnaise which I had requested. Attention to details and consistency is lacking in this place."}
{"text":"Always good and the staff is friendly.  I love the cherry pepper relish and always get it on my Roast beef sub.  The roast beef is cooked to perfection and the bread is always fresh. I eat here at least once a week.  You can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"Be sure you get charged for what you ordered. Sorry all the nice guys behind the counter, I left me feeling a little taken advantage of...maybe you made an honest mistake, but my being in a hurry earlier today, leaves me puzzled on how my mini roast beef sandwich when adding chips and a regular drink became a $12 meal (actually 13 when I added a tip). I think I got charged for the regular sandwich rather than the mini.  Don't know if I'll stop there again......don't like feeling like this was an intentional overcharge."}
{"text":"One word for this place... YUM!  Walked in and was excited to see the fresh meats and cheese being cut for sandwiches. There were plenty of fresh ingredients to chose from and the employees behind the counter were so helpful!   I opted or a hot sub...the #17 Philly! I chose steak and go make sure I could really taste the flavors I kept it simple no peppers or onions but they are optional for your sandwich and only lettuce on my sub.   I had to wait for it to be made FRESH in the back! I grabbed a soda and me chips and it was ready, honestly I could wait to try it!   And... it was as good if not better than I expected! There was plenty of meat, full of flavor and seasoning! The roll it was served on was fresh baked that day. Every bite was simply delicious!   I enjoyed the entire experience at Jersey Mike's and look forward to going back to try another sandwich!"}
{"text":"My little guys love love love their Steak and Cheese Subs with Steak only...no cheese.  I know that is confusing and no matter how many times I say Steak only, no cheese, we get cheese.  They are so sweet about fixing it.  I must figure out how to do a better job with this.  Even when we order the roast beef, plain.  Plain, nothing but the meat, it ends up with cheese.  And with 7 and 8 year olds, pulling the cheese off will simply not do."}
{"text":"Eat here if you want to spend more money for less than subway with the same quality of subway. I thought subway was lazy with sandwiches but not only is this place more expensive and just as bad as subway, you get less food!"}
{"text":"When I do not bring my lunch to work, Like to grab a quick sub here...  Every time I went, it was always a great experience!  Service is great and fast. Employees are especially friendly. Food is fresh and delicious.   Even though I always order the same thing, they always get it exactly the same. My fav item is Turkey Breast and Provolone - Mike's way and no onions. Makes me happy every time! Subway who?"}
{"text":"I have been to so many different Jersey Mike's locations  anywhere from Detroit, New York, Florida, etc but this location by far was the best one I have ever been to.  The place was very clean, great tasting food and exceptional great customer service. I would definitely make the extra 15 minute drive to come to this location.  Matt was great and very helpful during my visit as well:)"}
{"text":"Ordered a giant #13 to go and was helped immediately, no line. The people there were working as a team, helping one another, which is what makes a business successful. While I was waiting for my sandwich to be made, a customer came to the counter and expressed how happy he was with his sandwich. That's what I like to see! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Been to this store many times with no issues however the service has gone to the dark side treating the customer like poo. So many other sandwich places that don't act like dicks."}
{"text":"$10.10 for Miss Vickers Chips, 22 ounce soda, and a 7 inch sub.   Whoa!   Sub was all bread and lettuce.   Skimpy skimpy skimpy!   Service was fine, but I will not be going back when I can go to Subway for a 12 inch sub plus drink and chips for $7.00  .   Sorry Jersey Mike, but yous no good."}
{"text":"I rarely follow up a post with another one for a positive review, but this JM location may be the best one in Vegas, hands down. Anyone who's lived other places knows immediately that LV, considering it's a town based on hospitality/service(at least for tourists) ironically has the most unprofessional, apathetic and mistake-prone food service I've ever seen. Anywhere. Almost every other time I eat out or pick up food somewhere they screw it up and I end up getting a free redo(which I'm not complaining about, but that just ends up driving up prices for everyone else ultimately).   After a small mistake almost a year ago, they have been spot on A+ whenever I order food. Alex is an incredible manager who I feel now pays special attention to my orders because I usually order through the app and even if it says 25 minutes he has it ready in 5 -10, I live very close by and never have to wait a second. The food is fresh, tasty, and very customizable through the pretty intuitive app. Are there better sandwich places? Probably. But they can be expensive with inconsistent food quality and I've had to boycott more than a few for piss-poor customer service. So by showing good management skills and attention to detail, Alex has not only retained but increased my patronage when I want a sub. If only other places in LV could figure out this simple concept. Thanks Alex! I appreciate it. JM rocks, def one of my faves. Check out this location you will not regret it ever."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Only stopped inside because Mexican place had closed down already next door. The sliced Chicken breast wrap was average, good in a pinch, but nothing I would ever go out of my way for. It had semi sliced chicken heated with salsa, some cheese, onions and lettuce. Wheat wrap was healthier, but at 7 bucks it was a bit overpriced. Not much else, except they have a nice patio out back to enjoy the winter sunshine."}
{"text":"This place is going down hill faster than a greased up pig on a slip & slide... The staff used to be friendly, efficient and great team players.  Now it usually consists of 2 or 3 people going as sloooooow as humanly possible - making 1 sandwich at a time and only half listening to your requests so they end up making mistakes.    The last time we were in, there was NO ONE there to greet us and this was around 5 pm on a weekday/dinner time.  Instead they were all in the back.  They came out and the guy a head of us was a delivery driver for uber eats or someplace like that and they told him - \"oh yeah, the order never came through.  sorry\" and understandably the guy was pissed.  So instead of 1 person getting that resolved and 1 person to start working on our order - the 3 of them just were tripping all over themselves trying to figure out this dilemma.  After a 5 min wait, we just left.  I honestly don't think I'll be back because this is probably the 5th or 6th time in a row that service has been consistently poor.  And that's a shame because I actually prefer their sandwiches over Jimmy Johns across the street.  But at least Jimmy Johns staff have their act together.   Also - side mention - do NOT get the meatball sub here unless you like dogfood on a bun.  Worse meatball sub I have ever been served."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  The Cheesesteaks were huge!  Very moist and yummy.  I like them better than Capriottis."}
{"text":"Usually in a sub shop you get to choose your toppings! Not necessarily so here. Went in with a friend. Ordered Club Sub in a tub. Pretty good salad. Also ordered a Cheesesteak. Place was packed with a line heading to the door. Thought that meant good things. Actually meant they move at a snails pace. Got to the register to pay and never saw them start to make the cheesesteak. That's because it was premade, wrapped in foil. 3 times the cashier tried to ring me up for my tub and the sub ordered by the guy behind me in line. That's because she couldn't find my cheesesteak either!  Finally the sub appeared from a shelf or drawer below the counter. When I tried to order fountain drinks I was told \"no ice today\".  Hmmmm....105 degrees outside.  Ice would have been nice in my drink.  Maybe this was a bad day at JM's.  Might try it again..........might not."}
{"text":"I like Jersey Mike's - they are able to make a sandwich quickly, and still slice it to order.  They're very accommodating and friendly, and know their menu well.  The food is good, portions are good, and appropriately priced.  My wife is from New Jersey, and says they're the real deal, just like she had way back when.  Very good, very reliable.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Nice little sandwich shop off Steele Creek Rd in a local shopping center. The food was good, I ordered Italian and my girlfriend ordered the tuna sandwich. The sandwiches were good but I feel like the lettuce was a little soggy. I would come here again, it's definitely a convenient location."}
{"text":"Love jersey mikes !!!!!!! Love the location too !!! Friendly staff, convenient location and bomb subs !!!!!! This is my favorite location By far !!!"}
{"text":"I was so happy when I saw this chain appear in AZ.  I used to frequent it in CA and have never found another sub that comes close.    I think the secret to their success lies in the freshness and quality of their meats and cheeses - always sliced to order.  If you are looking for a veggie sandwich - you will be limited here.  But, if you like a hearty cheesesteak or italian sub you are in for a treat.  They also take a bit of a different approach in that they really douse their sandwiches in oil & vinegar.   It is a different approach but seriously good!  The \"Mike's Way\" option (lettuce, onions & tomatoes) is a bit bland, I love to add the mustard, mayo & pepperocini.  Their signature sandwich is the #13.  It has several flavorful italian meats plus freshly sliced cheese.  Don't judge this place until you have tried that sandwich!  It is unlike any other chain's offering & really amazing.    Their sandwich sizes are a bit different from the regular foot-long, but if you order the largest size you are getting quite a bit for your money.  I've visited the one that just opened in Chandler and was completely pleased.  And, I'm happy to hear they are now opening one in Ahwatukee.  They also seem to have a high focus on customer service - I've always been met by very cheerful, helpful people.  Not a necessity for a sandwich, but certainly a lot better than the opposite."}
{"text":"I went to this place thinking dear lord , airport food...but the philly cheese steak 'i ordered was very good, and a large portion, I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"I am very glad they put a jersey mikes next to my school. I live in surprise and the one in surprise is always very clean and very nice but this one here is not. The tables are not wiped down and the food line where they make your sandwich is not clean at all there's parts of other people's sandwiches in the containers of tomatoes and mayo. It looks like it hasn't been swept. It's over all so dirty and I am just comparing this to the surprise jersey mikes because that one is so clean. I wish this one was clean then it would be great! The staff was very nice no other issues than it not being clean..."}
{"text":"Night shift was incredibly slow and the only bread available was wheat. Food was okay otherwise but don't come here in a time crunch at night."}
{"text":"I do not know if they have good subs, because they do not have lettuce wraps, only salads.  I did not choose to partake in salad and realized for some reason, lettuce wraps just taste different than salad.  Maybe they will have in future."}
{"text":"I go here on a regular basis for my sandwich indulgence. They are always overly staffed which equals a very fast check out. From choosing the sandwich, having it made, to paying is less than 5 minutes.   However, since Spring Training has begun they have been very busy and the line may take a little longer. Trust me when I say it'll be fast and the quality of your sandwich will be amazing."}

The school will also be closed on Tuesday.  Health department officials said the faculty members became ill with norovirus-like symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.   The staff ate a meal together Friday night. About 70 people from the school attended. The lunch was catered by Jersey Mikes on Matthews Township Parkway in Matthews. The health department is working with the school and the restaurant to determine what happened.   No students were sick, officials said.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said norovirus causes inflammation of the stomach and/or intestines.  The most common symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and stomach pain.  At this time, norovirus has not been confirmed and the health department is waiting on test results from the State Health Department Laboratory.     http://www.wcnc.com/news/health/health-dept-looking-into-possible-norovirus-at-day-school/61762639  MATTHEWS, N.C. -- Faculty and staff members at a school in Matthews fell ill over the weekend with norovirus-like symptoms.   The Mecklenburg County Health Department says faculty and staff members at Covenant Day School began exhibiting signs of norovirus, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Initially, the school thought the staff members had obtained food poisoning, but health officials are investigating the incident as a possible norovirus outbreak.   The Health Department says all of the symptomatic faculty members attended a catered lunch on Friday, which was catered by the Jersey Mikes sandwich shop located in the 2300 block of Matthews Township Parkway.   The Health Department is working closely with both the school and the restaurant to determine the cause.   At the time of this writing, health officials are awaiting test results from the State Health Department Laboratory."}
{"text":"Had a last minute dinner gathering and needed food in a hurry. So i called Jersey Mikes to see if I still had time to order. It was already 11am and my event was at 5pm. The girl that answered gave us amazing customer service on the phone. She was outstanding so very helpful, and really knew the product. They took great care of us and our event had the right amount of food and it was delicious. I plan on definitely being a repeat customer and recommending  this location to all my friends!!"}
{"text":"Coming from Ohio, I'd never had a Jersey Mike's sub before moving to Charlotte. I go almost every Tuesday for lunch when they do any regular sub, chips, and a drink for $6.49. Great deal and ever better sub! You cannot go wrong with the traditional Italian or club sub  .... gotta have it Mike's Way! Staff is always friendly and very quick to make the subs."}
{"text":"Leave the Jersey in Jersey! The ordering process is painful here! The staff rushes you through ordering and acts annoyed to take your order! Love their sandwiches, but please, this is Arizona, people are friendly and polite here.... Adapt!  The restaurant IS always clean, the food is fresh, but parking can be a challenge!"}
{"text":"Great service- they never disappoint! All their ingredients are fresh!  Excellent quality meats and toppings. We only have a half hour lunch and usually call the order in for pick up- always ready for us! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite JM location. Super friendly staff, and they are very fast. The subs are very tasty and hit the spot. Keep up the work guys- you are appreciated."}
{"text":"This Jersey Mike's Subs sandwiches are too messy. I ordered this meatball sub Togo and it turned into a big soppy mess! The paper was soaked and over loaded with sauce. Less sauce and cut the sandwich in half-then it would be perfect! Also people were soliciting customers to buy perfume in the store and the parking lot. The staff knew and did nothing. I don't like feeling harassed and bugged while trying to pick up lunch."}
{"text":"Great sub shop that had its origins from a place I grew up near. It keeps the same great taste throughout the states it franchises in, which is very important. The prices are reasonable for the portion size. It's really a great place to find a true New Jersey style deli sub sandwich."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon (Superbowl Sunday, actually). I'm trying to reduce carbs, so I opted to have the Chicken Caesar sub in salad form....a major mistake. The female worker behind the counter grabbed a pitiful handful of shredded iceberg lettuce and threw it in a cereal-sized takeout bowl.  Without asking me about any other items I might want on the salad, she started heating up the chicken and took a different order.  I waited, and then a different worker grabbed my chicken breast and plopped it on top of the shredded lettuce. He handed me the most pathetic \"salad\" I've ever seen, so I said, \"Uh, do I get to put anything on this?\" The guy looked irritated but opened up the plastic container so that I could request a few pieces of tomato, cucumber, and onion on top of my iceberg pile.  It was pitiful.  I paid $7 or $8 for a tiny bowl of iceberg, and the service was terrible.  Do NOT try to get a salad here unless you're a 4 year old who only eats plain lettuce. Jersey Mike's, don't even offer the salad option if you're going to do it so poorly."}
{"text":"So first of all having 3 people hang out while one guy makes sandwiches, kinda lame. But whatever...maybe you can't make a sandwich and can only cashier. But not telling people you are out of the red pepper relish and then blaming it on the \"California drought\" is uncool when I just came from Cali and had it smothered all over my sando. With an extra side to boot! To top it all off, ordered a club and didn't even get the bacon. Thanks for the worst meal on our trip jersey mikes."}
{"text":"Great food for a franchise! Nice helpful quick staff! Thanks Troy ( manager)?Fresh sliced meats with a decent amount of deli meat on your sandwich.      They have cold subs, Philly cheesesteaks, salads, and wraps. Mikes way is a style they make your sandwich and worth trying . Short review while driving!!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's Subs is one of my favorite sandwich shops. I usually go to a location in South Scottsdale (Hayden & Thomas), but I stopped by this location after work on my way home.  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed in the service at this location. I waited behind another guest, whose sandwich was being made. I was kind of put off when I heard one employee say to the other employee, \"When the bread is too hard, I just throw it in the microwave for a bit to soften it up.\" So the employee proceeded to put the bread into the microwave, then continued making the sandwich.   That employee then made my sandwich - and I am unsure if the bread they used on my sandwich had been microwaved, however when I ate the sandwich, it was extremely hard. The bread tasted as if it had been put in a toaster oven.   I called and informed them that the bread was just way too hard to eat, and the employee on the phone did offer another sandwich if I returned to the store. I declined because I was home at that point, and I didn't feel like driving back in rush hour (plus I didn't want another hard sandwich).   In my opinion, if you have to microwave the sandwich bread in order to be able to cut through it...then that bread is probably old or cooked incorrectly. So unfortunately, I would not recommend this location for that reason."}
{"text":"It's honestly grossly overpriced. I heard good recommendations which prompted my visit, but the sandwiches are plain at best and nasty at worst and ridiculously expensive for something I could easily do in my own kitchen. Just go to Subway."}
{"text":"I have had Jersey Mikes once before and I liked it enough to try it again. This location proved to disappoint. The bread was soggy and my meatball sub was lukewarm. I ordered the middle size but was given the largest one and was forced to pay. The meatballs were tasted cold and mushy. I will not be back. I will stick to my Firehouse sub habit"}
{"text":"Went by today for the first time. First thing I noticed when I walked through the door was a nasty odor. Kind of smelled like sewage back up and I felt like I wanted to vomit. The folks there were friendly, the gal that made my sandwich was nice and made up my order pretty quick. They did ask me if I wanted my sandwich Mike's way and being my first time here I had no idea what they were talking about so, I felt rush to give them my order....first I needed to find out what they meant by Mike's way.  I ordered a regular size which equal in size to one and a half of a Subway sandwich only slightly wider. The bread(white bread) was tasty but a bit tough and chewy. Nothing to write home about though.  PS you folks need to clean the nasty stench."}
{"text":"I usually go just for the salad bar which I think is totally worth it. I decided to order a sandwich and was completely disappointed because it was soaked and soggie. It was a hot sandwich so it probably sat on the plate for a while before they sent it to our table."}
{"text":"My family and I love jersey Mike's and will continue to enjoy it but one thing is for sure we won't be coming back to this location, the girl that helped us was bery, very rude and the other two guys were arguing with each other in front of customers. We were there on Sunday after 2 pm."}
{"text":"We LOVE   Jersey Mikes! We love the club sub Mike's Way!! If you think Subway makes good subs, then you will just die when you eat a Jerzy Mike's sub!!! The taste is completely different, it's like comparing apples to oranges!   Also, the employees will laugh and joke with you! I don't know if that's part of their job description, but I like it! They always remember me & they always give me a free cookie with my sub.   The prices are much higher that Subway, but for what you get, the price is actually lower! Not to mention that it is SO much better!!! Once you try Jerzy Mikes, you'll never go back to Subway again!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but way too expensive for what you get! My Wife and I had passed this place numerous times, and each trip She'd say, That place has great sandwiches.\" So, last time we were near She stopped in and got us lunch... OK sandwich, nothing special (Safeway Deli is MUCH better), but it set her back some 14 frickin' dollars! I'll pass."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and friendly employees.  Very clean with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  My husband, 14 month old, and myself very much enjoyed our visit.  We will go back again soon.  I had the turkey..my husband, the big kahuna.  Can not ask for a better meal considering the price and quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Love this location!! Friendly staff and consistent quality keep me coming back when I'm craving a yummy warm Philly cheesesteak sub."}
{"text":"Great philly subs, probably best in the area. A little pricy but worth it if you're treating yourself once in a while. The restaurant itself is very clean and orderly. Nice service as well."}
{"text":"Truly is the closest thing to a Jersey sub you will find out west.  And that says a lot, because NJ has the best italian subs in the nation. Good job, Jersey Mike."}
{"text":"The food wasn't so great and customer service was no good I didn't enjoy my visit I definitely say that the crew need help with making the customer feel welcome and to that I waited really long for my food I rather go else where"}
{"text":"Had a great experience with Sherie, Brittany, Courtney, Jackson and Annie!  The service was excellent !  This is why I keep coming back  They greeted me right at the door, then quickly took my order!! These ladies had me laughing and they were so kind and welcoming. The bid me goodbye but not before they thanked me for coming !  Thank you Jersey Mike's for another wonderful experience!!!!"}
{"text":"The reason I quit subway and Quiznos!  I love this place! The manager is really nice and professional!  The meats are cut fresh right in front of you!  Please try the philly cheese steak you will love it!!"}
{"text":"I love this location!  The only problem is this one girl that works (I use that term loosely) there.  She is such a waste of space.   She shows she doesn't like to work and her attitude is horrible!   Lord help you if you ask for something on your sandwich because she'll give you grief about it.   Would love to know how she still has a job.  Every time I've been there (3 months) she has been there with the same attitude.  The manager and other employees are great!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this location at 11:30 on a Friday, before the lunch hour- or so I thought... This place was PACKED full of customers in line. The line was concert waiting long, really. As I was looking around to decide to stay or go, I noticed they were fully staffed, and the line was, well- moving. Upon closer inspection, it was moving very well. To help expedite the line, an employee came out from the counter and asked if anyone was ordering a hot sub, and he began taking those orders, and getting them started, which thinned the line quite a bit.  When I got to the counter, I was greeted warmly. I placed my order, picked my toppings and went to pay. Each employee was very nice, and the cashier and I were even joking back and forth, and it was really nice. It wasn't forced corporate speak, they were just nice and seemed excited about their product.  The sammie was very good, and while not as good as a Mom & Pop deli, it was good and the bread actually appeared as though it had seen an oven. The meat is sliced fresh (cannot understand why people eat at Subway, where it just sits, pre-sliced, for days). The veggies and condiments are fresh and plentiful.  Tips for success: -Carpool. This parking lot is very tight- no joke. -While  in line, check out the menu. It's silly to wait five minutes to order, and THEN look at the big menu and go 'Uhhh, uhhh, I think I want........ uhh.......\" -\"Mike's Way\" is basically most of the toppings, there are signs that explain it -Call ahead or email your order, saves time  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good subs.  Much better than subway, but not quite Capriottis.  Prices are reasonable, if not possibly a buck or so more expensive than they should be.  Staff was very friendly and the food comes our fairly quickly.  I would say the cheesesteak was cooked and delivered faster than Capriottis, but not as tasty.  I would put this place right around the same as Port of subs in quality, but they may have a slightly better selection."}
{"text":"Super duper subs that actually taste *FRESH*. I've tried the turkey club, the super sub and the Big Kahuna Steak -- All very tastey and very satisfying!  Really fresh and flavorful ingredients and the bread is pretty good too.  A little crumbly, but it tastes yummy. They grill their beef right in front of you.  I have found the service to be only slightly better than those other sammich shops.   Parking can be a challenge too since it is located in the strip mall where Ruth Chris' Steak House is located as well as the Firefly tapas bar, Yolie's and Marrakesh.   The sandwiches here slams Subway onto the ground and then steps on its face.    Go forth and chow down."}
{"text":"Iceberg lettuce as the major filler, bland tomatoes, thin slice of cheese, and mediocre bread...pass.  Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.  They rely on oil, powder, and salt for flavor instead of quality meats and cheeses.  My opinion based off of my first and last visit."}
{"text":"Subs are always good. The amount of meat is hit or miss. Some days you get a good amount and others not so much. All around good experience though."}
{"text":"This is an update to my last review.  I went into Jersey Mike's last night for the first time since my less than stellar experience and couldn't have been more pleased.  The previous female employee was not there and the staff was very friendly as I have experienced prior to my last visit.  My buffalo chicken wrap was warmer than last time and filled with lots of great condiments.  I was planning on writing this review but ironically the manager contacted me this morning through yelp to address my concern.  I am glad that a business takes the time to contact it's customers to address any problems or concerns.  I will definitely be back and tell people of my awesome experience."}
{"text":"Visited this location today a little after 1pm.  The line was extremely long and we decided to wait.  While observing the workers, they were not efficient and all seemed like it was their first day, except the girl who came out about half way through, she knew her stuff.  The cashier was busy talking and not ringing up the orders and the guy wrapping the sandwiches had a hard time cutting them and kept falling behind.  It seemed like we were in the twilight zone.  The good experience was they had bread and the sandwich was good."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and frank.  I work in the same area, walking distant, and I visit at least once or twice a week. Kinda $$ for the size, but still good. I am starting at #1 and going down the list....skipping the 14 because..its all veggie and a complete waste of money for the price it is at. I'll update once I am done. I am in no rush so it will be a while. So far I am at 4 and i cant say I would buy any of those again.  R\_   NOte: Lunch is busy with a line of 8 or 10. So be ready for that."}
{"text":"You guys. I love sandwiches. For some reason I've never even considered going to Jersey Mikes because I just assumed it was another Subway or Quiznos. I love this place! I don't know what it is about having the sandwich \"Mike's Way\", but it keeps me coming back. Meat and cheese freshly sliced, fresh bread, and the guy that is always working when I'm there is so genuine and friendly. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This has been one of my fav sub shops but today...I watched an employee wipe his nose on the wrist of his glove followed by handling a pen and then the register. Very friendly staff but maybe they need a food handler's refresher course? Yuck. I did bring it to their attention. (nonchalant looks). Remember, the gloves are to protect the customer- NOT to protect your hands.  If you choose to eat here, I suggest to pay close attention to how your food is prepared."}
{"text":"The staff seems to like each other & their jobs, which is always nice when running in to grab something to go. Visited three times & enjoyed the outcome each time. I usually order the buffalo chicken wrap on wheat. Excited that they opened so close to my house. Great job, Berewick Jersey Mike's! Keep it up."}
{"text":"love the food here but the workers at this location are rude and dont know how to conduct themselves professionally."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was hidden next to It's a Grind Coffeehouse and the shopping mall that it's in. No wonder I keep driving by it and never see it!  I ordered online, this was the first time that I've ever ordered food online and had to pay before I went in. (Usually there is an option for paying right then or when you pick up).. I had a coupon for 'a free drink and chips with the purchase of a regular sandwich' as well, but couldn't find anywhere to input that coupon on their site, so I just paid for the whole total and decided to bring in the coupon when I get there..  I order the Italian and Tuna sandwiches for me and my better half.. I have never seen so much oil and vinegar (?) added by default to sandwiches as I came in and watched they create another customer's sandwich. As I went to pick up my order, I mentioned my coupon and they seemed caught off by it, but they eventually were able to refund me for the difference. Interesting bread, almost too salty but I consumed it quickly since I love salt. Oil added was a little overwhelming, but I still liked the sandwich overall.   I would come back again to try other sandwiches on their menu, but I think I will stay away from their website for ordering if I have any coupons to use. I would say 3.5 but I'll up the stars since I believe it's a fairly new location."}
{"text":"Since January of 2014 I have, on three occasions, bought subs that ingredients have been omitted. Twice I have returned to the store and a new sub, with all the ingredient's I paid for, was made. It happened again last Tuesday March 18. I bough a \"Giant #8 and the bacon and ham was missing. I realized this while on my way to Tucson and could not return to the store. This makes me wonder if leaving off ingredients to cut costs is a company policy. Three times is not a random mistake."}
{"text":"Guy working today is a pro, very good service and sandwich was awesome. Got a big sandwich and it was Huuuuuge, so big. And he made it Great again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for an early lunch( 11:00) there were 2 other customers in front of us. There were 3 employees behind the counter that appeared to be working at a good pace. It took 25 minutes to get my Philly Cheese Steak sub , my wife was finished eating , when it finally arrived. The sandwich was not all that good, certainly not worth the wait. Back to Subway."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  I'm from Jersey, everybody in my family raves about Jersey Mikes and they are all in Jersey.  First off,  I ordered the Italian sub that comes with the works (5 different meats) and is supposed to come with provolone.  Got home to Buckeye to learn there was no provolone on my sandwich.  That throws the taste of an Italian sub off, period.  My second disappointment was the meat.  The franchise contracts out to a provisioner to make all their cold cuts under the Jersey Mike's label, but the meat does not have the flavor of New Jersey's finest deli meats, Thumann's. Boar's Head doesn't come in close to Thumann's but I'll take Boar's Head when nothing else is available. Third place goes to Dietz and Watson.  If Peter Cancro, the CEO of Mike's really cares, he'll get his meat elsewhere.   The staff was very friendly, the restaurant was clean, there were blown up photos of the Pt. Pleasant side of the Manasquan Inlet and Jenk's pier with surfers heading out, a nice touch of back home, but that's the best I can say.  The staff was so personable I don't regret leaving them a tip even though they forgot my cheese.  I just wish I had a good reason to go back and see them again."}
{"text":"So unhappy with my most recent experience at this store. We went out of our way to come in because I had a coupon or $1 off any sub and we like their pepper relish. We ordered our sandwich after waiting to be greeted and asked for pepper relish which they did not have. No sorry no nothing. Ok... Then I get to the register and I asked to plug in my points because we're getting a giant sub and didn't want to miss out on rewards, we're told that's not working. Ok that sucks. That's a big reason we go here, loyalty points... Then I asked to use my coupon and the staff member tells me no. After all of the other stuff that went wrong... No again? It was $1. He said it only worked on regular subs. I bought a giant... Which costs more than a reg sub, so the company is still making money. Wtf? The staff was unapologetic and absolutely the worst experience. You've lost my family's business Jersey. How disappointing."}
{"text":"Honestly this beats subway, Jimmy Johns, and Fire House. They have a great amount of selection you can also build your own but it's not as good as subways build your own. But the Philly Cheese Steak sells me it all. The taste is just amazing always hot even when you're 5 bites in. With a side of chips and a drink nothing can be better. Fast service and great workers."}
{"text":"My son told me to try Jersey Mike's, he likes it better than Jimmy Johns.   I visited the shop in Goodyear, corner of Dysart and McDowell roads. The restaurant was clean, and the staff were friendly and upbeat. I was greeted by two different people when I walked in. When asked if I had been there before, I said no, and they gave me a free cookie.   Based on a Yelper's review, I tried the Philly Cheesesteak. It was the best I've had in Arizona (the best ever was at The White House in Atlantic City, NJ). It's also the first time I've ordered a \"hot sandwich\" at a sub chain and had it actually served to me HOT. It was wrapped in foil, and when I unwrapped it, steam was coming from the meat and cheese.  The sandwich was delicious. The staff were friendly. The price was a bit steep, but not unreasonable at all considering what I got for it. The place was clean. What else can I say? I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight and ordered the Super Sub. So delicious. I am kind of biased towards Jimmy Johns subs, but this company loads on a lot more meat on the sandwiches, and they have a larger meat selection.   They offer a great student discount which includes chips and a drink. I read previous reviews about ants in the soda machine so I was extremely cautious. Inspected the soda, and it was ant free. Yay.   Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Good food but think kids run the place. Tried to tell them their chips were expired - like June/July 2017 and was told to wait until their line went down."}
{"text":"I have been eating jersey mikes for the last 2 years bc I'm from NYC never heard of it but ever since I had my #13 mikes way, I haven't had another sandwich yet. Ok I've tried the #7 once but why change it up!?  Always fresh always made to order. Better than subway in my opinion good meat to bread ratio!   Double point Tuesday!!!  Never had a problem ordering online or in person!   Great service!"}
{"text":"I gave 2 stars because the food was good.. Service, not so much.. My review may be harsh because of a pet peeve. My order was wrong because I was never asked what I wanted on my sub. Usually that's not a big deal EXCEPT the remark was \"that's not what the ticket said\" when I advised them. Rather than a simple oops and \"I'll remake it\", I felt like it was a hassle or an inconvenience to correct my order. Customer service is everything people."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! I called in an order close to closing time and the young lady took my order and said I had to be there by 9p to pick up my food. Upon my arrival her fellow coworker informed me that they did not make my order because they weren't sure if I would come and had turned the burners off already. I am currently still hungry and riding around looking for food. Sadly inconvenience... TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice shop and I'm a big fan of the Turkey sandwich Mike's Way"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened here, but this was one lousy lunch. Would rather have good food than nice employees, but my hot sandwich was a hot mess. The chipotle chicken cheesesteak was pretty much a disaster mainly from the cheese they used and the chicken meat which didn't taste good at all. They did forget to put the mayo on sandwich, but employee brought it over without me asking. It would not have helped the situation. Maybe not a bad sub shop, but at least steer clear of this sandwich."}
{"text":"Ugh, this location is the worst out of the three that I frequent.  This one is VERY close to my work, so we order trays of subs from them quite a bit.  Most of the time, they screw it up, so I finally decided to write a review about.  Called yesterday (24 hours in advance) for one tray of subs.  I asked for the tray to have equal amounts of 3 different subs.  I also asked for it to be delivered at 11:30am.  When placing my order, I felt like I had to \"coach\" along the girl on the phone.  \"do you want my name?  do you want my phone number?  would you like my credit card?  what about expiration date?\" she didn't ask for ANY of these things!  At 11am, the sandwiches are at my office.  I guess I would rather have it there 30 minutes early than 30 minutes late?  The platter had mostly Turkey & Provolone, NO Club and just a FEW (like 3-4 pieces) of the italian.  I asked for the onions to be on the side- no onions at all.  Even when we order a normal one sandwich they seem to mess it up AND take over an hour for delivery.  I'm pissed but I don't feel like calling because it won't get anywhere with them.  Lost cause with them.  So annoying!"}
{"text":"This location is awesome, we walked in and was greeted by the worker named mike. He was funny and joked around when it came to topping our sandwiches calling it his way aHim and the other guy working were very polite and helpful. The subs were made fast and tasted great! I will definitely be returning to Jersey Mike's!"}
{"text":"This place was fairly solid. The menu is simple, but I liked it because it had things you can't get at the other sub places (capricola, etc). While I don't have one of these near my home, I would definitely fit it into the rotation if one were to open. The food was good and seemed fresh.. however, I was really put off by the lack of condiments. Mayo or vinegar? You can't even offer light mayo? Just seems lazy... and the lady behind the counter seemed annoyed that I would even bother asking. Oh well, I'd still return."}
{"text":"The food is good but the staff is extremely rude MONIQUE to be specific. I've visited this place today and asked for specific things for my sandwich and she had an attitude the moment she approached the counter and then ignored me while I asked for my sandwich to be prepared a certain way."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in tonight we were greeted with a smile. I asked for an opinion on what to get and one of the workers helped out with a good option. Immediately Dan started chatting with my fiancé and I and was extremely friendly. We mentioned we brought our dog along but forgot a leash so we'd take the subs to go. He offered to check his car for s leash and brought one in we could borrow. He made our subs and also brought them out to our table we were sitting at outside. Dan was extremely friendly and had amazing customer service, even aside from helping us with a leash. Will be going back to this location!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service,  stood in line behind a family of 4 that couldn't decide what they wanted. Instead of one of the other two employees offering to take my order they stood there stupidly and watched as I just waited there ready to order.  Not once did I get a \"we'll be right with you\"  or even \"just a second\"  they sat there did absolutely nothing and watched as I started to get irritated.  After about 8 minutes of no interaction whatsoever from any of the three employees I'd had enough and walked out...   If I could I would give ZERO stars"}
{"text":"Overall: I love sandwiches and this is my go-to, especially for a good, solid classic-style sub. I keep coming back to their Italian and Mike's way is the only way!  Food: As noted, while they have a couple of fun subs like the Big Kahuna Cheese Steak, I feel that they hold it down when it comes to a more \"traditional\" approach with their subs: good bread, quality meat and simple ingredients. That's not to say that traditional is bad. Other sandwich spots have their angle. Jersey Mike's just puts a product that stands more on keeping to simple ingredients of quality than venturing into the hit-or-miss territory of inventive subs.  Staff: I have been here plenty of times (many of times I even forget to check in....I get sub-sandwich-tunnel-vision) and I have never had a bad experience with the staff. They are professional but they are also fun and talkative; they do not go into that mechanical sandwich-making auto pilot mode you see at other spots. Also, while it looks like chaos at times, they are very good at assembling multiple subs at once (when I go...it's usually for picking up an office order so it's usually 4-8 subs).  Facilities: I usually take my food to-go but their facilities are always clean. Additionally, all of the location I have been to have had plenty of seating."}
{"text":"I remember years ago when this location opened and how excited I was.  Our family has been getting our subs here since.  I've been a fan since eating at the original NJ Shore location decades ago.    After tonight, I'll be hard pressed to return.  The \"Giant\" turkey and provolone sub my wife purchased was about 3/4 in. of lettuce with a few slices of meat, cheese and tomato added.   To put this in perspective, Subway's been known for single layer meat and cheese...this was that bad or worse.  You could only really taste the lettuce...sad.  This wasn't just a poor sub in Jersey Mike's terms, it was simply one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had...simply a disappointment."}
{"text":"great sandwiches! and the sweet tea is awesome! i will be going there allot lol."}
{"text":"I use to love this location, but after a new manager came in, it's not the same. The manager is EXTREMELY rude to the employees. I went in to get my favorite, a number 7 Mikes Way. The gentlemen who made my sandwich was very nice, made it to my specifications. I went to pay and the GENERAL MANAGER wrapped up my sub with no gloves after handling money from the previous customer . On top of that, he asked me if my sub was made correctly, I told him yes. And he proceeded to asked the man who made my sub if he made it correctly. Excuse me, I just told you it was, you don't need to be condescending to your own employees. A lot of the friendly faces that made this location bright and enjoyable seem to have left or been fired, and I'm sure it's because of this new rude manager."}
{"text":"We could tell this was a new place as soon as we walked in the door. There were only a few customers and the restaurant was spotless. Overstaffed by about three people and all were very energetic and very welcoming. We ordered our food and sat down to wait. A few minutes later they called our name and we grabbed our food. My Buffalo Chicken Wrap was really good, at least to those of us that like wing sauce and blue cheese dressing. Yum! I also appreciated the fact that they offered a wheat tortilla and I didn't have to ask. My BF got a Chipotle Cheesesteak and said it was pretty good too. The prices were reasonable. This could be a good place if they can keep up the momentum. I will surely be going back to give it another try."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. The quality of food was great. However, I received the least amount of meat I have gotten in my giant 9. I didn't order a giant to get 6 pieces of turkey, 6 pieces of roast beef, and 4 strips of bacon... I go to jersey mikes in San Diego a lot. I've never gotten a tiny sandwich like this one."}
{"text":"Really good turkey sub! Luv the place! I just feel awkward when the CC  Machine asks me to tip and they're are looking?!"}
{"text":"First time to a Jersey Mike and I have to say my husband and I were impressed. I got the #13 and my husband went with the super energetic employees recommendation of the #44 I believe which he LOVED. While we are in, the employees were cleaning and singing which is so positive. Many places don't have employees that show they enjoying working there. This won't be our last time there.   My only feedback is I wish they had name tags so I can recognize there positive attitudes."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheesesteak. Service greatly improved. They have gotten it together."}
{"text":"First I'll just start off and say that Brianna is the best! From what I can gather, she is a manager here, and she is always nothing but amazing. Everyone else here is pretty good, but if Brianna is working on my order, I know I have nothing to worry about. I would call in my orders from work all the time, and this location is great. I advise you to order by menu #, as this seems to help. I recall getting one or two orders wrong over the hundreds we've ordered, but this is tiny compared to any of the other places we've gone. And the food is always amazing. Compared to Silvermine, Jimmy John's, Subway, and Capriotti's, Jersey Mike's is just the best.  California Club is my personal fave."}
{"text":"The team is always friendly here!! This is by far my favorite sub option around! I haven't had a sub that isn't good.. And everything is great \"mikes way\"  My favorite? The tuna!!"}
{"text":"Dont waste your time or money going to this Jersey Mike's location. Ordered a sub from here and the workers couldn't even get the order right.  Asked for jalepenos and red pepper relish, got neither.  I will never go back to this location, even though it is the closest to where I live. Extremely incompetent workers at this location."}
{"text":"Service was lacking, we were the only people in the place and had to hear about the two gentlemen talk about the schedule for a few minutes before we were even greeted. Ordered two small subs with small drinks and chips. I had a philly style beef with spicy sauce, the Kahuna or something. It was meh, ok. I won't be back because I spent over $20.00."}
{"text":"Their subs are really great so instead of just saying that I want to add a couple details. When I walked in, the guy at the counter was watching tv and didn't look at me for about a minute. When he did turn to me he was very friendly and I had a great turkey sub. I have to point out though that for the money, you don't get a very big sandwich. Compared to some of the other sub places in town I would say this was the most expensive for what you get. Can't argue with the sub though!"}
{"text":"Love how friendly the people are. This place has GREAT subs. Love going there and the way the food is super fresh and the meat and cheese is cut in front of you. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Very fresh food one of the best subs I've ever had. Very friendly, clean and best of all they honor our military with an excellent discount.  Just wish it was closer to where we live."}
{"text":"Normally I leave very happy...from other locations. Seriously don't waste your time. I got a chicken Caesar salad wrap for $7.50. Problem was this wrap consisted of chicken, a pinch of lettuce, and a crap ton of dressing. Plus it took a while for it to be finished. My boyfriend also got a sandwich that barely had any meat on it. So disappointing. Don't waste your money or time coming to this location. Oh and on another note one of the girls was sniffling and wiped a huge booger from her nose and then went on to help making sandwiches without washing her hands...gross."}
{"text":"These guys (and gals) are pros. They run a tight ship there and no one is ever sitting around not working. Not even in the same category as Subway - I would highly recommend.  Love the turkey sub made Mike's way."}
{"text":"Not sure I will ever eat here again, the place was extremely dirty for 7 o'clock on a Sunday night, my bread was stale and the amount of sub you get for the price was disappointing. The staff was friendly and nice, but other than that, it was disappointing."}
{"text":"I love this franchise! Unfortunately this new staff has a lot to learn. They have no idea what goes on each sandwich and it takes 20 mins to get a hot sub. I've been here three times since it opened and it's the same service each time"}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes is pretty good and is like any other sub shop....my favorite is Port of Subs this is no Port of Subs but it's a perfect spot. I got the Super Sub which is huge and looks like it would be pretty good except for the bread it self. Epic fail the bread they made my sandwich in was so old and hard I was forced to eat everything but the bread. They must check their freshness...because it kindda makes you wonder what else are they keeping as long as they can. The only reason why I didn't say anything is because the people there were soooooo nice. I would've felt bad to complain so I just dealt with it the best way I can. Hopefully next time I will get fresh bread for sandwich. I will be back, if I have to! Because of the old bread and ok sandwich this won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to get a sandwich. Waited at the front counter for 10 minutes and couldn't find an employee in the entire store. I walked out and went somewhere else. My recommendation? Avoid this place if you're hungry and want to eat. Clearly they do not staff their establishment adequately."}
{"text":"Totally delicious meat madness to the mouth! Rosemary Parmesan bread takes everything up like five notches abs that's huge considering how good it all was/is.   I got the ham/cappicola one with added hot pepper relish it was crazy good! Huge juicy tomato slices, lettuce crisp and not brown, their dressing topped it all off like a true sub shop with culinary tastebuds backing up their options.    Divine is all I can say."}
{"text":"Update they have tasty cakes!!!!!! So excited still such a great lunch spot for me  Clean and happy environment and I learned that all through March they are doing donations for charity and they explained all jersey mikes do it every March, what a great company :)"}
{"text":"So I got my normal philly cheese steak that is pretty good and pretty close to the one back home in philly. My wife on the other hand went out of the box and got something she never got before. After taking a bite from it she realized it wasn't for her. With out charge they made her any sandwich she wanted and went back into the comfort box. Thank you for understanding and letting her get something else."}
{"text":"I have to order lunch for work meetings quite a bit, I'm always looking for good food that is a crowd pleaser. I tend to order online (easy!) and pick up the next day. The customer service has always been upbeat and they have been great about my requests (oil/vinegar on the side, that way the subs don't get soggy on the drive back to the office) - they even got me signed up for their loyalty card and I've earned a free sub.  Also, they are great about wrapping the veggie sub separate from the meat subs. This puts me at ease presenting the food to guests and coworkers. Also, the subs come labeled in a cute box. So be sure to consider the box of subs for your next office meeting or party of ten."}
{"text":"Today was my first time going there and I will be back. It was lunchtime so the store was busy but the staff was friendly and very efficient. I got a Reuben and it was tasty. I'd like to try some other items too."}
{"text":"I normally have great service at this location, but today was not my day.  I ordered two sandwiches online and picked them up at the promised time with no issues.  Once I returned home, I realized that both sandwiches were made incorrectly.  It looked as if both sandwiches had the opposite \"extras/toppings\" mixed up, which, I believe, is an easy mistake to make.  I got in the car and drove back to the store.  When I walked in, I tried explaining what was wrong with the sandwiches, but I felt as if the employee just wanted to fix a new sandwich and get rid of me.  She repeatedly asked, \"What kind of sandwich do you want?\"  I told her that I wanted the sandwich that I ordered online and that she should use that order to guide her.  (I honestly wasn't trying to be a jerk, but, if a store is going to offer online ordering, it should be easy to retrieve an order, especially one that is only 10-15 minutes old.)  She went to the back and came back with another employee.  The second employee asked me what kind of sandwiches I wanted and, again, I told her that I wanted the sandwiches that I originally ordered.  This tactic did not work again, as I was told something to the effect of, \"Just tell me what you want on each sandwich and I will make it for you.\"  So, negating the benefits of online ordering, I ordered each sandwich like a normal walk-in customer.  I ended up getting the sandwiches that I originally wanted, but I ended up wasting time and gas.  The second employee apologized several times for the mistake.  The first employee re-wrapped the sandwiches and set them on the counter behind her.  (I'm not sure if she was planning on serving them to guests later or eat them herself or what.  I'm thinking that the sandwiches should have immediately gone in the trash, but I'm not an employee, so I don't know company policy.)  I thoroughly enjoy eating at this location, but I don't imagine that I will be ordering online after this incident."}
{"text":"Subs are very good, friendly staff but paid over $9.00 for 6\" regular sub, no extras and I actually measured since I was surprised it was so small. Good but pricey!"}
{"text":"I had a coupon, I called in an order, it was ready when I asked. I was able to get extra jalapenos. Sandwiches were delicious.  A regular is  8 inches. i had t o wait a few minutes at the cashier because it was lunch time. He apologized for the wait which was not very long.    I will be back. It was yummy!"}
{"text":"Such yummy sandwiches! Customer service could be a little more friendly though. Nobody ever looks too happy to be there which isn't a great vibe to give off but I love the food! Mine and my love's new sandwich stop!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this establishment! I am a vegetarian and this staff always makes sure to get the cheese from the precut section as to avoid cross contamination with the meat slicer. It is very hard to find a sub place to take that request seriously. They even clean the counter, knife and change gloves to be sure none of my sub has touched meat. It may sound silly, but these guys have my business for as long as they are there! They are always super friendly too! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this for the first time. I got a wrap which was eh at best. They put way too much honey mustard on it. Husband got a sub. He said it was just okay but wouldn't go there again. I agree."}
{"text":"In the past few months this location's service has been getting worse than ever. I am a regular at this location and had to update my review. I'm the past 2-3 months they have made changes and are not the same as they were before. I have had the manager make me the completely wrong sandwich I didn't notice until I was already at home. I have had to ask an employee that was TOUCHING THE TRASH CAN TO CHANGE HER GLOVES AFTER SHE TOUCHED MY SANDWICH WITH THE SAME GLOVES. More than 3 times they have been out of wheat bread (by noon at that) or it was burned. Today I went in and was told that they \"turn the grill off at 8:15\" it was 8:45 and the open sign was already off. I understand people want to be done as soon as possible but I'm sure the schedule doesn't have the employees leaving right at 9, if that's the case then the hours should be revised. I wasted 20 mins driving here for no reason. The employee looked like he could care less, he was doing nothing when I came inside. I contacted the customer satisfaction number and never had my call returned. Don't waste your time coming here."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had. The manager Hutch started arguing with me because I wanted my sandwich a certain way. He told me \"This isn't subway it's Jersey mikes\" I never used inappropriate language yet he continued to argue with me even saying \"I not trying to be a dick\" while there were kids present. He even told me if I didn't like it to leave. He was being so rude and unprofessional I had to ask him repeatedly not to argue with me. It was so bad that another customer even came up from his table to tell Huck to stop arguing with me that I am a customer and he can't treat customers like this, Huck then tells that customer he can leave also. I asked for his boss' contact information which he refused to provide, he said I can go to the website- I told him I'm aware of that option and his reply was \"Then why did you ask\" I'm shocked he is the manager and thinks this is okay. I would give 0 stars if I could. Sad this was all because I wanted my order a certain way, he shouldn't work here if he doesn't like his job or dealing with customers! I'll never return here because of him and advise others to seek other locations to avoid this treatment."}
{"text":"Love this place. They make the best Big Kahuna Cheese Steak sub I have ever had. Keep up the great work guys."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to relax and enjoy free wifi along with an outlet to charge, go elsewhere. Within 30 minutes I was harassed by \"Gary\" the bartender saying I need to order something or leave. I had already discussed with the server that I planned to make my order to go and did not want a soggy sandwich. The menu advertises that all sandwiches come with chips and pickles... Unfortunately you will not get a pickle.  The #13 was average. Go elsewhere, don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!excellent customer service!  Amazing cheesesteak! Had JM famous philly with extra peppers! A packed Sunday and service was great!   An employee even came by to check and see how are food was... Will def be back!  Thank you for a nice lunch and experience!"}
{"text":"Best sub in Charlotte!!!!!! Excellent service! Attentive and interested ownership! Brings me back to the Jersey shore."}
{"text":"While the food was acceptable the attitude from the manager (brown hair girl with a bun) was not!  No smiles from any employees and actually heard a sigh and saw her roll her eyes when we asked to add to our order. The owner may want to rethink who they employ and the way they represent their company."}
{"text":"I'm from the Philadelphia area, so I am picky about my cheesesteaks. I found Jersey Mike's to be remarkably close to a genuine Philly Cheesesteak! This is my favorite local sub place (Subway and Jimmy Johns not making the cut) for a quick lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my daughter in Charlotte this past weekend and we needed a quick bite to eat.  So we decided to try JM's (I have celiac disease so need GF).  This location was great!! They made my sandwich in a dedicated space and were so nice about it!!  I had tried another JM's in my hometown prior and had the worst experience so I was very happy to see that other JM's take this seriously!  Great employees at the Dilworth location!  I will be back :-)"}
{"text":"This is not the same quality as the Jersey Mike's we have in san diego. The roast beef wasn't rare at all and portion was not what I am used to. Overall the sandwhich was good."}
{"text":"I have been here twice since it just opened. The first time I had the Original Italian, which has provolone,ham,proscuittini,cappacuolo,salami, and pepperoni. You can add the veggies and topping that you like. This sandwich was pretty good, but it didn't impress me that much. The second time I went I got the Big Kahuna Cheesesteak which has steak, grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms, jalapeños, and extra cheese. Now this what was quite tasty. It is one that I will definitely go back for. Overall this place is pretty good and is definitely a nice break from places like Subway."}
{"text":"They were out of Cherry Pepper Relish during dinner on my May 13th visit. Super disappointed, as the relish is what really makes my sandwich great. Could the manager not stay on top of the inventory ordering or what?!  The staff was not very friendly. There was only one person in front of me, and just about to pay for their sandwich when for some reason, the crew decided to make me wait and ignored me for 5 or so minutes without serving me, let alone acknowledging me, or telling me they'd be right with me.  NOT what I'd consider good customer service --rude in fact.   Oh, and the floors were dirty.   Overall, the sandwiches are good, despite being a little bland on my latest visit.  Just hope the relish is in stock and the service is much better next time."}
{"text":"I really miss the last owner of this place.  No more lunch specials,higher prices & they don't even have trays for your meal anymore. I used to come here several times a week. Not anymore."}
{"text":"Always see the same staff, they are always super helpful and make great sandwiches! Sometimes I prefer the cold sub and sometimes the hot sub, but with either preference I trust this location."}
{"text":"Best subs around , super friendly staff,  spic and span - the cleanest place ever. Only thing that would make it better would be if they delivered!!"}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better than this. By far the best subs I have ever eaten. We moved here last year and ran across them while exploring my new neighborhood. Then I got a coupon and thought I would give them a try. I love how fresh everything is, and the everyone I have encountered who works there is extremely nice.   I gave up eating at Subway after their endorsement of M. Vick for Sportman of the year so the only sub place I go to now is Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"I drove from my house to stop and get a sandwich, 20 minutes. Arrived at 9:15pm. The door was locked, and the lights were dim. The hours on the door stated they were open until 10pm. Drove 20 minutes back to my house pissed off. Either change the hours on your door and everywhere else or hire new staff that will stay open until the stated time. Thanks for wasting my time and gas."}
{"text":"as sub shops go this one is pretty good. much better than Quiznos. they are a little proud of their subs though."}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience just now at Jersey Mike's! Usually my fiancé and I don't get good service when we go places but the guy and gal working tonight were super nice and very accommodating and didn't seem annoyed at all. There's just something about ordering food from friendly people that puts me in a good mood! We always have a great experience at this location!"}
{"text":"Been waiting a while for a JM to open closer to the Avon Lake area vs driving to Rocky River to get my sub fix quenched.  Fresh meat and toppings.  Highly recommend Mike's way: oil, vinegar and spices.  The cheesesteak and Baja wrap are a must try as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved the Jersey Mike's in NJ so when we heard they were opening up by us here in PA we were so excited.  They dont toast their subs like subway and dannys.  But their meat is fresh as they slice it as they are making the subs.  Our order was done within minutes with no delays and it was FANTASTIC.  We will definitely be coming back to the Jersey Mike's in South Park Shops.  Their customer service and attention to detail is the greatest."}
{"text":"Good, fresh subs but wayyy OVERPRICED!"}
{"text":"The two guys working at the shop were so polite and fast! They had great customer service!! As soon as we walked in we were cheerfully greeted. They were efficient and worked quickly while keeping the customer engaged in conversation (asking how our day was, etc.). While we were eating they went around asking the people eating if they were okay or of anyone needed anything. Every time a customer exited, the workers thanked them and said \"have a great day\", but it was genuine!"}
{"text":"2 stars because I love Jersey mikes. 3 stars taken off because the 2 guys that were there are rude!!!! Get a better attitude douche bags"}
{"text":"Now I love a great sub sandwich and Jersey Mike's makes a pretty good sandwich but unfortunately I have to say I will never go to this location ever again. The service was horrible every single time I went. It didn't matter if they were busy or slow, although I don't think I ever saw more than 5 people in the restaurant at any one time. I went early into lunch time, late near the end of the lunch rush and later in the evening and every time I was practically ignored while the staff talked to each other complained about having to work a day after a holiday and other staff members. On a couple of occasions an employee would come out from the back, where they hide until a customer comes in, and they would walk to the register and stand there staring off into space. Never making eye contact. Apparently they are not trained in making sandwiches or using the slicer but a hello, someone will be right with you would have been greatly appreciated. Then the sandwich maker would make their way out, they'd chat with the register guy and take their time washing their hands (much appreciated) and putting on their gloves. Eventually they shuffle their way to their position and ask me what I would like. They have on almost every visit, stopped in the middle of making my sandwich to discuss whatever is on their mind with their co-workers. Standing their with half of the turkey for my sandwich in their hand. There is never anyone who remotely acts like a manager around. Maybe they are hiding in that special room in the back. This last (and final) visit there were two other people in line when I came in. the staff was chit chatting and ignoring every customer. Eventually they asked the first customer what he wanted. Then proceeded to ask each of us quickly what we wanted and started making sandwiches. Instead of taking care of each customer as they came in they lumped us all together and made me feel like we were bothering them. When I finally got to the register guy he took his sweet time, presents with me a receipt that has a spot for a tip (really??) and then made an exaggerated effort to read what was written on my shirt making me more than a little uncomfortable and then proceeded to argue with me whether Yoga was jut like going to a gym. I really wanted to throw my sandwich at him. So to sum it up, Jersey Mike's good sandwiches! Terrible service at this location and I will NEVER go back. Sadly this one location has turned me off of the brand."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is always good whenever I go! The service is fast and friendly and the subs are delicious!"}
{"text":"I come here to get  the tuna sandwiches they are very fresh  and the teens  that work in this Mikes are on there JOB it's always clean the customer service is great. No bad for a place in the airport"}
{"text":"I've seen a number of people complaining about the cost of the sandwiches here which I don't entirely get. They don't seem any more expensive than they are at their non-airport locations.  I find this location to be fast and friendly and I like their sandwiches.  It's really easy to stop there when waiting for a flight or a connection.  The sandwiches travel well so they re great to take on the plane with you.  I'm usually out of there for less than $10.00 and am not hungry afterward so it feels like an OK deal to me."}
{"text":"I love jersey mikes!! Living on the west coast has some challenges finding a good steak and cheese. Jersey Mikes is a close as it gets in PHX without getting on a plane.  Yes, it's way too much money for a sandwich regardless of size but I'm willing to pay. I would come more often if the prices were more reasonable.  I give this location 3 stars as I've never had an issue with the food but the service is lacking. Young kids with no leadership. The location i go to for lunch in south phx at 51st and baseline has a manager who trains his staff, it's obvious as they have the system down. I've only been to this location in the evening and there is no sense of leadership or direction. Customer service is sub par."}
{"text":"I could seriously eat at Jersey Mike's daily. It's by far 1 of my favorite deli meat / sub places to eat in town. The staff are always so welcoming and friendly and the place is always so clean. The chicken Philly is incredible as is the turkey BLT. They alive the meat in front of you and always give you plenty. They don't short you like subway. If you want all the fixins, just ask for your sub \"mike's way\" and you are sure to have more than you can handle. The location of this jersey mike's is perfect right off Las Vegas blvd and by the outlets. The only drawback for this location is that the parking lots are often full and space is limited. But all in all, this is a great place to eat and I will be back again and again. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Update- the owner/manager was kind enough to respond to my review and try and make it up for the mistake by going above and beyond. I appreciate that very much, that's what you call excellent customer service and the replacement sandwiches were exactly the way I know mikes to be. Updating rating."}
{"text":"Great food with a good staff. Very straightforward sub shop with tv's set on sports. Very clean location and staff has a good sense of humor. I will definitely be back to dine again."}
{"text":"This is most likely your best option for an overpriced sandwich at the airport. Definitely better than the ones in plastic wrap and you pay just a bit less at Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Best jersey mikes in the valley! Fast friendly service. Delicious subs... What more can u ask for?"}
{"text":"Staff is awesome and our sandwiches were so bomb. Thanks for our dinner guys! Great job."}
{"text":"This Jersey Mikes is filthy!  I'm surprised that they have a sanitation grade of 96.5  The tables are dirty.  The floors are in poor shape.  The bathroom is beyond disgusting.   Don't plan to come back here or that other dive of a restaurant down the strip mall."}
{"text":"Just went to Jersey Mike's for the first time! The sub was so much better than subway or blimey, but the girls making the subs were the real highlight! Brandy and Bree explained the whole menu to me with a smile on their face even though they were about to close. I'm a business owner and really pay close attention to customer service, these girls were great! You can tell they like their job. Thanks girls, and thank you jersey Mike! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I go here about twice a month and love the sandwiches. Great workers and fresh great tasting food will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes is sooooo Awesome!!!! I love having ordering their steak sandwiches especially for after my workouts!! The people there are very friendly,funny, and all around Nice people in general. I always love walking and greeting them And each time There is new conversations New laughs New Jokes. They really care about their food and they make sure your 100% satisfied. Never once have I been unsatisfied. Every single time I am always 100% satisfied. Best sub shop out there. And their meat is delicious healthy and has amazing taste. Variety of sandwiches have not tried them all but I'm sure their delicious!! Jersey mikes is the best and always will be. Once you go there for the first time you will come back multiple times. -Mr. Jay"}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes is sooooooo awesome!!!!!! I love going there for delicious steak sandwiches for dinner after my workouts. The staff are very friendly kind and funny. I love getting to chat with them every time. They really care about their sandwiches and they will make sure you are 100% satisfied I know I always am. Never once have I been unsatisfied. When I always go there New memories New laughs New jokes. Jersey mikes rulesss they are #1 and they are my favorite sandwich shop. Variety of sandwiches I haven't tried them all I'm sure their delicious. After your 1st visit you will find yourself returning multiple times. They're food is soo delicious healthy and it's good for you they really care about not only their customers and their meat. Their meat is abosolutely delicious. I recommend you go to Jersey Mikes if you have not yet done so you will find yourself going back multiple times I guarantee. Always #1. Love their food very much. Staff is very awesome -Mr. Jay"}
{"text":"The sandwich was good but $23 for two small subs?!?!  Biggest rip-off i have ever seen.  Definitely won't be going back here specifically for this reason.  I hate when places at the airport take advantage of travelers just because \"what else are they going to do?\"."}
{"text":"I just had the big kahuna. Absolutely delicious! It was everything a steak sub should be, what we all expect. Warm, moist, flavorful and exceptionally delicious. I got onions and jalapeño peppers on mine which took it up a notch. WONDERFUL! Not only will I return, I'll recommend."}
{"text":"A-OK. Boyfriend and I used to come all of the time, before we located the nearest Port Of Subs. Sandwiches are good, not great, and they only have like 1 sandwich with chicken ( I'm picky about meat). The place started to gross me out with the smell of the subs when I brought them home."}
{"text":"I was hungry for a sandwich and it was a lunch rush so I understand that you won't get the highest customer service and they try to crank people through. I got the club which was okay the bread was dry, but I can only give them two stars because when I got to the veggie section of the ordering process the sandwich wizard started just throwing things on it, luckily I noticed it was mine and I had to speak up and he grabbed the things off the sandwich which I didn't want.... always love when they just grab them off. Then the real reason I cannot give them a positive review was the manager told the man in front of me he could not get a cup for water..... and told him he would have to buy a water bottle..... come on now.... how cheap are we getting that someone can't get a glass of water with their average sandwich."}
{"text":"My family absolutely loves this place!! The food is great and the employees are too. They are always so nice to my kids. They talk with them, make them laugh and smile.  It is nice to feel that warmth.  Great place for families!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location, I can't say enough good things about it.  The staff is always friendly and Tommy will get your order exactly the way you want it.  I come here quite often and never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"My experience here was absolutely terrible, I came in with a coupon for a free regular sub with purchase of drink and they declined my coupon when it was acceptable at all locations. The worker refused to let me speak to the manager and said I had to pay or leave! Never returning here again. No respect for the customer"}
{"text":"We had sandwiches for our office . The bread was nice and fresh but the amount of meat was  very little.  The prices were  high  higher than  their competitors."}
{"text":"Middle aged Hispanic lady wearing glasses treated my friends and I like trash. She rushed me and caused me to butcher my order. She was extremely rude and disrespectful throughout our dining experience.Jersey Mike's is my favorite sandwich place; however, your self absorbed employee is the reason I will never return."}
{"text":"Stopped in Sunday for lunch after a high recommendation from a friend of mine in San Diego.   She claimed it was the best sub she's ever had so I had to try it.  Unfortunately my sub came up short with lack of taste and toppings.  When we pulled up I noticed it was super busy and was thinking man they must have great subs for it to be so packed.  Was lucky to get a booth inside but it wasn't as clean as others have stated in other reviews.  I had to take one of their comment cards and wipe the table of all crumbs on the ground as others had obviously done from the looks of the floor.  I had the Chipotle Cheese Steak sub that I split with my husband.  The bread tasted ok, but it wasn't fresh out of the oven. They skimpt on the steak and hardly saw any onions at all on it.  For the price of the sandwich I really was expecting to get more.  The sauce was the best thing about it but I was wanting more of it as well.  I won't be going back.  Sad that it wasn't a better first impression."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in for some subs one night. We had a coupon and it was a good deal. The place is clean, the staff are very friendly, and the food was pretty good. The bacon on my sandwich was actually crispy which I don't often find at other sub shops. The guy who rang me up at the cash register was super nice. He threw in a couple free cookies when I told him it was our first time there which was pretty cool. I think more places could benefit from having someone like him working with customers. All in all, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love their ingredients and fresh food but I Waited in line for 15 minutes just to place my order (and it wasn't busy) When I finally got up to the counter to place my order they were out of white bread and said it would be 20 minutes to make it.  The wheat bread was dry the last time I went there which is why I wanted white bread. The kids behind the counter didn't seem to have a clue about what what going on. I left without placing my order."}
{"text":"Fresh food. Bread was super soft and the meat was sliced right then and there. I love this place. A little pricey but worth the quality."}
{"text":"Gotta say despite being a chain, this is great place!  Great bread, meat, peppers, clean, fast.   Pricey yes, but a good sub always is!"}
{"text":"Thanks for bringing coupons and cookies by our office.  This is a review to let you know I used them and got me into the restaurant.  Very good sandwich as always.  My favorite is the California club.  Avocado bacon and turkey.  Everyone will be using them to come get a sandwich. Thanks!"}
{"text":"So we got a few free sub coupons brought into our work and I had never tried this place. Since using the coupon both my husband and I have become regular customers and put our local subway on the back burner. The roast beef is so delicious and fresh! And I love thin sliced provolone. The the customer service at this location has always been great! They are always nice and super fast. And it's a whole lot of sand which for a little price. We will definitely be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Always quick service, and food is always great. It's similar to subway where you can pick your toppings. \"Mike's way\" is a must!"}
{"text":"Stay away!!!!! Go to subway or cappriottis Ordered a jesey milkes philly cheese sub.Asked for bread to be toasted......they said they don't do that.Ok so now the bread is thick....really thick....and gummy.They microwaved the sandwich.....REALLY....a f.....philly steak sandwich micowaved.To lazy to do it the right way on grill.Then they lied and said they didn't micro it. it.DO you job and make a good.  sandwich....then you will have happy customers.Lazy mf's.Stay away."}
{"text":"This is the best Jersey Mikes location I've been to. Harrisburg and North Lake don't compare. Get a #9, Club Supreme or a Philly and you won't be disappointed. Kids eat free at this location on Sundays and be sure to sign up for their loyalty card. If you get to know the guys, they might even hook you up with the UNCC discount."}
{"text":"New store. Still a little slow. Missed the mark on building the sandwich. Asked for pickles... no pickles. Little overkill on the vinegar and oil. This sandwich was soggy.  Price is a little high. 9.50 for a regular size sandwich.   Parking is awful. Spaces are extra small. Come here for your car door ding."}
{"text":"I had gotten a little obsessed. Steaken Burger Closed and I couldn't stand having to find a steak place...COULD. NOT. STAND! So, I was running around, every night for weeks, trying new places looking for a great cheese steak. Jersey Mikes is THAT place.   The service is a little bland, BUT friendly! It doesn't matter because I leave with a steak and it's consistently fulfilling, good, tasty and a delight!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sub shop. I love that they slice everything fresh right as you order it. All of the standard subs can be in a soft bun, a wrap or a salad. The seasonings and dressing is delicious!"}
{"text":"The pastrami was pretty good.  Not the best, but better than when subway offers it.  Wife really enjoyed her sandwich."}
{"text":"Firest time to Jersey Mikes. Very good at explaining options and standard sandwiches. Food was very good and employees were great. Will be back to jersey mikes."}
{"text":"The regular sized sandwiches are already pretty big and about $7 each. We got one Big kahuna (philly cheese steak with jalapenos and peppers) and one #9. Both are great. The philly is very cheesy and the meat is chopped in small pieces but tender. Sometimes the peppers are pretty hot, but this time they weren't very hot. I know it varies sometimes. The bread holds up really well even with all the hot cheesey-goodness. I actually really like the bread here. It's soft and chewy but doesn't get soggy until pretty much the very last bite!  The bread on the #9 holds up the same, even though it's a cold sandwich that's generously drizzled with oil and red wine vinegar. Have it Mike's Style and that includes lettuce, mayo, tomato, oil, vinegar, onions, but doesn't include pickles or mustard. Ask if you want those and they will gladly put them on. I usually get extra pickles but I forgot to ask for them. I didn't even miss them bc the sandwich was so good. It also comes with bacon, and somehow the bacon is very crispy without being hard and chewy. They have almost the texture of bacon bits but these are real strips of bacon. I usually never get bacon on anything unless I cook it at home bc it always ends up hard and dry and not crispy, but not here!  Staff is also very friendly.  Make sure to sign up for their birthday club and get a free regular sized sandwich AND a drink for free! No purchase necessary! But you can only redeem on your actual birthday.  The only minus I can think of is I wish the order counter is first, then the pay counter. The way they have it now you get to the pay counter first, so if it's busy the line can get awkward."}
{"text":"Love everything about the food at Jersey Mike's. This visit however, they were loudly playing some pretty explicit hip hop crap with kids in the store. Not cool."}
{"text":"I would give this 5 stars, but can not. I like the subs hot and cold. They are very good! The turkey made Mike's way is great....much better than subway and jjs. I used to live in NJ and know they make great subs. If these were good as the ones in NJ I would give em 5 stars....lil more meat on the subs in NJ...."}
{"text":"So here is the rundown: Capriottiis  Jersy Mikes Jimmy Johns Subway In that order. However, Cap's always seem to get soggy quick. Jersey Mikes knows the right ratio of everything. If you have not had it 'Mike's Way' then you have never truly lived! Service is quick and the staff are genuinely nice. Thanks ya'll!"}
{"text":"I have found another sub place that I will now frequent besides Subway and Cappriotti's. They all have their unique flavors and different selection. I think Subway as a chain is good for the value, Cappriottis has their distinct sandwiches, and now Jersey Mike's - definitely high quality meats and just good sandwiches. I am a fan of many of their sandwiches including the club, the original italian and some of their hot subs including the cheesesteak. You can get it Mike's way which is how they were intended and also make sure you get the hot chili spread to spice up your sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing. Fresh deli style meat and great tasting! I LOVE this place. It puts subway to shame, I will drive out of my way to go to a Jersey Mikes!"}
{"text":"I just had to follow Kelly M. This Jersey Mike's location is soooooo much better now that it has been remodeled and is under new management!!  The new staff is amazing. My husband and I travel on the East Coast a lot and often try to stop at the local deli shops. When you stop into those East Coast deli shops it feels like you have always belonged and that you are family. Well this Jersey Mikes on Paradise Road gives you the same experience. The staff is friendly, provides the best services and can make a great sandwich!!! I also love the new decor and can't wait to go back again. I usually get the Original sub, Mikes Way and it's the best!!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised at all these negative reviews on here. I have been here on numerous occasions to get various sandwiches and never have had a bad experience here. All the sandwiches that I tried have been at least above average and the people helping you out at the counter have usually been very friendly and helpful. The location for me is excellent as it's on Hayden & Thomas, located in a strip mall with other restaurants as well.  Jersey Mike's is nothing fancy but it's a nice spot to get a quick bite to eat, and for that I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I'm a BIG Jersey Mike's fan! I can honestly say that they make one of my Top 3 favorite subs of all time. I always get their turkey and provolone on white (the bread is aaaaaamazing - crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside), Mike's Way (DUH), with a little mayo, and pickles on the side. Mike's Way includes lettuce, tomato, onions, oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and spices. SO YUM! I always get light on the oil since I get a tad bit of mayo too. I mean, go big or go home, right? I also get the regular size (about 6 inches or maybe slightly bigger) and it is plenty! They pack on the toppings.  I love Jersey Mike's because they slice the meat right in front of you, so you know that it is super fresh. Their turkey is very lean and I love it! They have a great chip selection as well.  I recommend eating the sandwich shortly after you get it (if not in store) because the oil and vinegar can make it soggy if you wait too long! If you're not going to eat it right away, maybe get that on the side and add it right before you eat.   Anywho, i'm glad that they built this location closest to home! I have been known to drive 5+ miles just to cure my craving! See you soon, Jersey Mike's!"}
{"text":"They put plastic on their lettuce.  Do not come here!!!  I'm not kidding!  Came here twice I thought it was an accident but 2nd time around my sandwich was drenched in clear thin plastic."}
{"text":"Too expensive for what you get. Other reviewers are right. The employees have a bad attitude. Subs are okay, way too salty."}
{"text":"These guys make a pretty good sub. It's a lot better than most of the other sub options around, especially the large chains. The service here is always fast and friendly. Their bread is good and meat sliced fresh. Mike's way is the way to go with your toppings...good stuff."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I got the big kahuna steak sandwich and WOW! It tasted like home;the east coast. Quana  was awesome, she smiled while taking our order and made sure it was correct. She made sure I was aware of my membership in which I had forgot. She even made suggestions that made my stomach say mmmmm. Way to go for taste and Quana for service."}
{"text":"My sandwich was great. It was free, because of the number of shore points I earned. I ordered it straight through the app and it was ready when I arrived at the store. Still hot.  I ordered a giant philly cheesesteak. The sandwich was delicious, as always. However... it was much smaller than I am used to. They have made their sandwiches smaller. Even though I didn't have to pay for my sandwich, I'm pretty disappointed that they decided to make the sandwiches smaller. Other than that, things were ok."}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes, how I love thee let me count the ways, or at least let me count the money i have to get another sub!  Ive been a loyal customer to Jersey Mikes since my Jersey Shore days, and bringing this franchise to NE Ohio made my entire year!  First, this location is a bit smaller than most, but fear not the quality of food is still awesome. The staff was friendly, a little distracted when it came to ordering, but nonetheless i was happy with my visit.  I ordered a chipotle chicken philly, after a bit of a mixup it came out and was fresh as heck! the meat was perfect, the chipotle mayo was awesome, i ordered a regular i should have gotten a full size UGHHHHHH! Im a little bummed because they dont have sides like the original jersey mikes, like fries or something, but im still equally as happy with my chips i got.  Pricing was a bit higher than most sandwich places but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Double meat. Double cheese. Mikes way. This should apply to every sub. At first it may feel a little expensive but the portions are massive and the quality is there."}
{"text":"The staff is always super friendly but the service is slow if you order chicken or steak. They prepare it fresh and it just takes a while. Food is great though! The parking lot is sometimes difficult to pull out of but you just have to be careful."}
{"text":"It's 2:30p on a Saturday. The location is busy- but not that busy. I stayed to eat my sandwich and observed never more than two people in line at once. The whole place is filthy. Tables are dirty. There's trash on the floor. Countertops where sandwiches are being made aren't being wiped down. There's a large knife right next to the check out area of the countertop that is coated in mayo and mustard, along with bits of lettuce. Not a great impression overall. Poor attitudes in some of the employees - \"I just want to go home\" was stated by the guy cutting deli meats. This same guy is literally just pulling rolls of meat and cheese out of the case, cutting them and (no joke) *tossing* them back into the case. There is no keeping anything separate or concern for proper food handling. Sandwiches are made with little to no care. I won't be back to this Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"We were excited to try the new location. Waited for 15 minutes for two sandwiches--a veggie wrap and a California chicken. The chicken was still raw in the middle. I would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's was the Jersey circus today!! The 3 young people at the end of the line, sandwich maker, wrapper and cashier were the friggin' 3 stooges!  It was more important for them to be getting the lingo down and trying to be cool. Then getting the orders out in a timely fashion. What a cluster!  But hey! At least they are working!!"}
{"text":"I somehow obtained a coupon for this place so I decided to check it out. I told the gentleman behind the counter that I'd never been there before and asked for his recommendations. I ended up trying the #9 which had roast beef, turkey, swiss, and bacon. They make the roast beef there. Everything was super fresh and yummy and I ended up completely stuffed. They guys that work here are super friendly and they gave me a free cookie since it was my first time. Free stuff always wins me over so I'll definitely be going back next time I'm craving a sub!"}
{"text":"BY FAR THE BEST SUB SHOP!!! Everything is so fresh and delicious every single time I get it. The manager is awesome, super nice and personable. If I could afford to go there every day, I WOULD! I've been to other locations around the east valley, but this location is definitely the best in my opinion :) Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I LOVE me some Jersey Mike's... but this location is slacking. The staff is just ok. Nobody really seems to enjoy their job. And this location is extremely small, but often times not as busy as other locations.   There's a guy in there, that when you order vinegar & oil on the side, he wraps the foil into a flower on the top, making it impossible to open the foil in 1 piece. Upsets me off every time...   I received an email stating I could get 50% off my first online order, so I placed an order for lunch. I arrived when it was time to pick up & was given all of my items without an hassle. I get into my car & begin driving home when I think, I should probably check this sub before I get too far. Unwrap my #8 Club Sub to find there is NO BACON! How do you leave out the main meat that always goes on this sub?! Then, I had no mayo & had also requested they add pickles. None of those items were there. I quickly returned the sandwich & had them make me a new one, which they did no questions asked.   I don't know if online ordering is new or not, but they definitely have some kinks to work out. Maybe think about adding all of the ingredients you actually offer on the sub, like pepper. Salt is an option, but not pepper?? I did take notice of the print out tickets they read to make the sandwich, tells them what NOT to put on the sub. I think this makes it hard for employees to remember what SHOULD go on the sub in the first place, causing them to screw it up!   I may not be a huge fan of the online ordering or this location, but I will ALWAYS come back for more because it's just THAT GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Love this Jersey Mike's as they are always so friendly. The reason for the 3 stars is because I decided the last 2 times to skip the line and order online and both times they completely messed up my order. So I say just don't order online and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Can I give NO stars? Ordered \"cheese, steak and mushrooms with NO onions or peppers and got it all! Not happy and then when we called to let them know it was wrong we got attitude! Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Updated review: The sound system is much better now. Thanks Lalo!   I like Jersey Mike's. This location is very clean, and relatively new. The staff is friendly, nice and competent. The roast beef sandwich is outstanding!!! The bread rocks and it's a fantastic place for lunch or a light dinner.   The station they play is retro and it's awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The #13 is my favorite....  I love you can order a mini.   It's the perfect size...  and I always get it Mikes way!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best sub shops in Phoenix.  Not amazing but good bread, good meats and fixens."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Jersey Mikes about 10-12 times and have gotten sick twice. Last night was the second time i've gotten ill after eating there. I'm done. There's nothing like being up all night sick and in cramping pain to make one vow to never eat at a place again. I got sick once before after eating at this location, but because I had eaten there several times before that and felt fine, I was willing to overlook ONE bad experience.  I thought maybe it was a fluke. Nope. Happened again last night. I have no idea what the problem is.... but maybe they ought to really look into their food prep/handling/storage/refrigeration and also employee and store cleanliness protocol. Because there is something not right somewhere.  I've eaten at Panera (next door), JJs and Chipotle (across the street), Mcdonalds and subway (in the same complex) ... and I've never, NOT ONCE, gotten sick from eating at ANY of those locations. This is now the SECOND TIME I've gotten painfully ill from this Jersey Mikes. I'm done."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place for a good old fashioned sub. We love the Jersey Mikes near us in Minnesota and now there's this one. Yay!! Unlike other popular sub chains Jersey Mikes really piles on the cheese and meats. I always have my sub done \"Mike's way\" delicious! We were here yesterday and came back today.  This is the closest to an Italian deli sub sandwich there is. Great to have you in the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Super delicious & fresh! They slice the meat in front of you basically when you order. There bread is so good.   They have 3 size choices to choose from. A mini, regular & giant. Also I'm surprised they don't have a lot of choices to put on the sandwhich. Which is good I guess so it doesn't make it that complicated. I believe some of the toppings are tomatoes, lettuce, onions, pickles, banana peppers, jalapeños & mayo plus seasonings.   I got the original Italian. Regular size & the mikes way it was so flavorful. I did add mayo, pickles & banana peppers. Even with out adding those things it would be delicious.   Also you can add your phone number for points"}
{"text":"I placed a online order at 11:15am. They informed via email my order would be ready at 11:33am. Upon arrival at 11:39 I gave them extra time knowing it was going to busy lunch hour timeframe. The order was not ready. I specifically ordered on white bread as I'm allergic to wheat. They made my sandwich on wheat. They took the sandwich back and remade. To my surprise all they did was give me a wheat bottom bread and gave me a top white bread. Since this is my first time and my last time. I called to get this rectify but they said they were busy and would call me back. Yet to receive a call just over the moon not happy with customer service and staff. I will never go back if they can't not get a simple sandwich order correct. It's not rocket science."}
{"text":"Well we finally tried Jersey subs, having seen many commercials for the cheesesteak, we had to try! We tried the Big Kanuna and a regular one! They were not great, the big Kahuna said extra cheese, eww it was not a good taste. They were just not very good tasting, for over $23.00 for 2- 6 in subs not a bargain either. We did have ice tea too, which we love the brand they serve and it was good.  Now this was my rating on this sandwich alone so may have to try another one to see if it's better. I was surprised at 11 A.M. that only 2 people there and all the tables were not cleaned. I wiped off the seat and table we sat at but could have used a wet cloth cleaning. No one wiped tables while we were seated as more people came in and looked for a clean table.  Not a sign of a good place to eat for sure. All in all it was a dismal experience among sub restaurants."}
{"text":"Not as good as the original in Belmar, NJ but about the closest to a real Jersey sub as you can get in Arizona"}
{"text":"Man, I'm super glad this Jersey Mikes opened up close to my work.   I don't have much to say beyond what these other fine folks are saying. The sandwiches are really yummy.   My pro-tip is to sign up for the emails. They send out a coupon once every week or two with some good lunch deals. Save yo' dimes yo!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby. Had the chicken parm and was breaded and pre made it looked like. Other than that, it was nothing but quality. I prefer penn stations chicken parm though. 4/5 for Jersey Mike's though!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's didn't make me weak in the knees but it is clean, efficient and friendly.  The menu is a little difficult to read for a first timer, so the zig zag lane where you order your food made me feel a little rushed. I went at lunch time and it was packed. The mini sub is what should really be called a regular.  The regular is quite large and the other size is enough for three people. The club had plenty of meat on it. It was difficult to tell the difference between the white and wheat sub rolls, but they were not bad. The most interesting thing was the cups the drinks come in.  There are several different cups with the stories of various Jersey Mike's that have done fund raising for feel good causes. I want to believe this is true because we all like to think we are patronizing do-gooder companies. It may just be branding, I haven't had a chance to really check it out yet. I would go back, but I want to try something spicier next time."}
{"text":"Now these guys make a mean sub. Quality is top notch. Service is quick and place is well layer out. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the parking situation is the worst. The lot is for a bunch of businesses but is way to small. Trying to get in or out is like a scenario out of a mad max movie."}
{"text":"Very friendly people. They asked me If I would take their picture with my Original Italian toasted sandwich with bannana peppers. It was so good. You have got to go."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch in between clients. This place has real (non-turkey based everything) lunch meat that's freshly sliced to order. They bake their bread in house, too.    I got a veggie sub and it was awesome! I'm so over going to Subway! These guys have them beat and I'll go out of my way to go to them when I have a craving for one!"}
{"text":"Superb service, friendly staff. Food is delicious. And they sponsor a team in the Dilworth Little League to boot!"}
{"text":"The owner and management made things right. Went back and had amazing service. If they can keep it at that level, this place will easily become one of my favorite locations.  Previous review: Jersey Mike's is my favorite sandwich shop. This location is very hit or miss though. Sometimes they're great and other times you're better off going to Subway or buying package food at the Fry's near by. It's very inconsistent. Today I ordered a sandwich and cookies off Uber Eats, which I do on a weekly basis. The sandwich arrived made incorrectly (this happens more often than it should) and the cookies were overcooked and burnt. Unfortunately after being disappointed about a dozen plus times with this location, I'll be taking my business elsewhere.   If you eat here or order food from this location, be prepared to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Thank god a new location closer to my house! The staff is very friendly, place is always clean, and the subs are the best in town!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Nice employees.  But:  Me - Please, can I get the Italian sub as a hit sub. Them - Sure  10 minutes later - here's your sub.  Me - ah, it's cold."}
{"text":"This was my friend's first time eating here. We walked in about 30 minutes to close when two employees, not paying attention to the door, were cleaning the grill. My friend ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich. The employee told him he just put that stuff away. Which makes sense that he didn't want to re-clean the grill. So he reluctantly ordered a cold sub as anything hot would require re-dirtying the grill.  It's a shame that that he wasn't able to get the sandwich he really wanted because the workers were obviously trying to be out the door the minute they close. He will probably not be back."}
{"text":"New ownership, so we gave it a try. Never again.  Was a regular customer of previous owner. He knew me by name. Got two coupons for free regular sub, chips and drink, so my wife and I decided to give the new owner a try.  We up sized to giant knowing it would cost us. Not a problem.  My wife ordered a giant Philly cheesestake with extra meat, extra cheese, mushrooms and onions. She was told it came with peppers and said no peppers. She was asked again if she wanted peppers and said no. Then the order taker handed her the ticket. She asked if he would take my order and was told that he would but wanted to make sure that the order was right.  We get home and find a nice big sub with peppers.  I call and explain, and drive back 6 miles.  We get there and the owner gives us a giant sub that is obviously thinner than what we brought back. He says it has extra meat and cheese. We say no way, as it's so much thinner and ask him to compare to the one we brought back. He says he already through it in the trash and is not going to get it out and that he already made us a replacement. As though it was our fault that his people made a mistake and we should be grateful he made a new one.  I explained that was his error as we didn't get what qe ordered.  He said he would not fight with us and refunded what was paid for the sub.  Not how to manage. No apology for the mistake. No trying to earn a customer's business. Nothing.  I will be shocked if still in business in 6 months. It also turns out that I was overcharged. Instead of charging me the difference a free regular and a giant, I was charged for two additional regulars. I will just take it up with my bank."}
{"text":"I LOVE the sandwiches here!!!! My fav sandwich chain by far! There are however, a couple things about this location that could be improved.   1) The speed of their sandwich making needs to be faster.  2) The soda is disgusting because they skimp on the syrup. After thinking they must have made it poorly on accident, I continued to get Pepsi with each visit and being bad every time. It's so disappointing, that I actually went for the Dr. Pepper today. Mush to my displeasure, it was just as bad. Stay away from their sad soda machine!!  Suggestion to the franchise owner and/or manager... Stop cheaping out on the soda syrup!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean facility, fresh ingredient, a bit skimpy on the meat (roast beef).  I liked the bread, however, the pricing is too high for what you get in comparison to what you can find at a few local delis at a similar price point that would provide a more generous portion of meat on your sandwich above the quality of Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place out since its next to my coffee place.  I though it was pretty good and the service was quick and friendly.  They were pretty busy and the place was clean too. I got the Jersey Shores Favorite and thought it was pretty good and I liked that they sliced the meat right then and there.....no opening the package in front of you like another sandwich place!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been here 2-3 times before, with same results. They offer good food, enough options and friendly staff but are pushing you thru the line so fast they miss steps.   This time I arrived at 11:45 on a Wednesday and there were 12 in line. The line normally moves quickly but right when I got to the counter, the manager went in the back for more bread. That was a good thing cuz he's usually the guy who rushes the most.   When I got to the cashier she ran out of register tape. It gave me a chance to inventory my lunch, which was missing one component.   Problem fixed, good lunch from there. The bread was fresh, the meat and cheese were hot and gooey and the sparse onions, once I finally got them, were fresh.   Still can't recommend this location yet as I am 0-4 on my lunches, due to their implied race to finish."}
{"text":"Cheerful greeting as you enter and good service.    Its a typical Jersey Mikes that is located in half of the old Blockbuster on East Blvd.  They do have a parking lot with a reserved spot for call in or online orders.  The seating area seems pretty spacious, and I've never seen more than 5 people actually eating there but I've never gone during the weekday lunch when I imagine they get more business."}
{"text":"The best chain sub shop I  have been to!!  Fresh soft bread with lots of thin freshly shaved meat and cheese with fresh veg and great seasonongs.  Freindly workers and good sweet tea.  Wish there would migrate to the Nothwest!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich.  They cut the meat right in front of you to go onto the sandwich and to get it Mike style......forget about it.  Was simply an awesome sub.  But to get a regular size with chips and a drink for $11+ seems a little steep.    Service was friendly, and I would return.  Just be prepared to pay for it."}
{"text":"This is the best location I've been to. Really friendly girl making the sandwiches. I had the roast beef club, by far best sub I've ever had for a chain in Arizona. I will definitely be back!!! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I always loved jersey mikes! Their subs are always fresh and flavorful. When I moved this one was my closest one and thankfully still keeps the great standards of other Jersey Mike's I've been to. This place is always clean, the staff is always friendly. I usually go around dinner time and it's never a line but I'm sure they have busy moments. The phillys are always freshly made on the grill and the buffalo chicken philly is one of my favs!  The Italian is my favorite cold sub and you MUST order it mike's way to get the full effect!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich! You will never go back to subway. I love their roast beef and their philly is amazing. I usually eat here at least once a week. The employees are awesome too! They hooked me up with one of their fresh baked cookies on my birthday!"}
{"text":"Alex is awesome. He made up a sandwich platter for our bosses birthday . It was a Hugh hit!!  Thank you Alex for all the extras!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Jersey Mike's over the past nine years and was excited when  they recently opened this location.   Sandwich shops seem to be the new fad in the restaurant industry. What they call quick food. Maybe because of the Great Recession, but they have proven to be very resilient in a slow economy.   If I type into Yelp search: 'Sandwich', with a 1 mile radius, I come up with no fewer then five different places.  Along with some others that do other quick food items, like Corleones and Paradise Bakery.   That said, this Jersey Mike's is convenient, clean, offers good value (when using coupons) and has a Manager/Owner on the premises, with employees who have been trained well and are friendly.   I just enjoyed a #13, Original Italian, with a bag of chips and a 22 oz drink for the coupon discounted price of $6.99 plus tax. And, I received 6 points on my Jersey Mikes Club card. The sandwich was good, with a fair amount of cold cuts on a soft piece of sub bread that held up well.  Nice.   So in summary... Go... Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They make the BEST sandwiches. Nice ratio of meat vs veggies. Great polite service too!!"}
{"text":"Had the Italian. Pretty delish but the other items were less than mediocre. Cesar wrap had no flavor and had way too much dressing. Salads were runny with water. This was pickup so i could not see them as they made it. I would go back for the Italian sub but do yourself a favor and skip the other items..."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad but the workers were rude and disinterested."}
{"text":"Discovered this place when I first moved out here, I've become addicted! I'm a vegetarian, the grilled veggie wrap is yummy. My friends have all told me the subs are all delicious as well, especially if you get it \"Mike's way\". This Jersey Mike's is my favorite though, the staff is always super friendly, and they are packer fans! I can always come in, have my wrap while I watch the packer game. I feel at home :-)"}
{"text":"I had a positive experience at Jersey Mike's. I liked that the store and its restroom was clean. I liked that my kids each got their own small sub, chips, and a drink for under $5 each. I also really liked the quality of bacon that was in my sandwich. Most of all, I was grateful for the comfortable and friendly atmosphere. We will be going back."}
{"text":"First time at Jersey Mike's. Ordered to-go for the family: an Original Italian for me, Turkey and Provolone for my wife, a BLT for our daughter and a Buffalo Chicken Wrap for her husband.   Our sandwiches were made on time, which was refreshing for this area: we usually have to wait for take-out orders despite arriving at the appointed time.   I ordered the Italian because Port-of-Subs has a similar sandwich that I had had the day before and I wanted to compare. My sandwich was good, but not as good as PoS. I liked the red pepper spread. It was fresh but I think the bread was the difference.   My son-in-law said his Buffalo Chicken was okay. He had better and had worse.   I'll try Jersey Mike's again. It is in a convenient location, the service is very good and the selection is okay. Maybe a different meal next time?"}
{"text":"Worst Jersey Mike's ever. The employees are rude and obnoxious. Subs are bland and ingredients seem old. One time, my husband and I came in 30 minutes before closing and we were going to eat our subs there but then an employee came over and said \"we're closing down\". It was not closing time and I found that so rude, so we just left. It's always dirty, the TV is blaring, the seating area is tiny, and it's just a horrible place to eat. The employees act like they don't even want you to eat in the dining area. I would much rather eat at the Northlake location."}
{"text":"Wow. So stingy. I tried to order from another location.  3 within 2.3 miles. Couldn't gat anyone to deliver. Pickup only. Very  disappointing!"}
{"text":"I ordered my first sub over the phone. Was a little bummed that they don't deliver, but the friendliness of the staff and the quickness of the service was totally worth the little commute! I ordered the veggie sub. Tastey little sandwich and the regular is pretty filling but I'd recommend going with the largest one if you're super hungry."}
{"text":"I saw someone with a Jersey Mike's box the other day or I wouldn't have known they existed.  I was told to try the place as the subs they got there were the best they had had for a long time.   I had to make a decision whether to go their or AJ's this week.  I have to tell you Jersey Mike's had two strikes against it before I walked in there so I almost didn't.   I am not a big sub person.  Usually the bread is satisfactory but that is about it.  The second strike is most places that advertise themselves as being from a specific area offer a product  you really have to develop a taste for  if you are ever really going to enjoy it.  Maybe if you are from there... ?  I was about that far from not going in...  I am glad that I did.  They don't offer all the toppings one might find at the other large chains. Only two kinds of bread?  The difference is in the quality of what they do offer.  That by far makes up the difference.  I had a toasted veggie wrap and really enjoyed it.  Everything was fresh and crisp without an overpowering ranch dressing.  Nice fresh bread that tasted like it had been baked that day.  Enough to fill you up without making you feel stuffed.  I have no problems with the thought of going back.    One more plus for Jersey Mike's.  I had to wait longer than I expected.  When I finally did get my order, I mentioned it was my first time there.  I was immediately told they were shorthanded and got an apology for having had to wait as long as I did.  That really impressed me as they were really busy and it was genuine, not lip service.     Nice place."}
{"text":"Count me as one more reviewer that thinks this place is both tasty and overpriced.  #13 Italian ftw"}
{"text":"We had been patronizing this sub shop since June of 2014.  What I find really annoying is that  the sandwiches are good, but the staff expects to get tips and the register asks you to tack it on to your receipt!  No.1, their staff is preparing sandwiches behind the counter, they ARE NOT seating me, taking my order, and delivering it to my table.  No. 2, I am standing in line, ordering, waiting, paying, then taking my food from the counter to the table or out the door.  No. 3, I am not sure when these types of restaurant owners/managers thought it was acceptable to ask patrons to pay tips to preparation staff, but it is unacceptable.  No. 4, When I decline to add a tip to my purchase here, the cashier got visibly angry!  No. 5, If they want to earn tips, get a waiting job!  Get rid of the \"entitlement\" attitude.  If you do not make enough in this type of position, get a second job!  There is nothing wrong with working a couple of jobs: most of us grown-ups had to do that to get ahead.  It is a sandwich shop - not a restaurant, period."}
{"text":"Apparently they don't stay open till nine anymore. I guess we'll be going to Capriotti's from now on."}
{"text":"Jersey's Mike's makes a good premium sandwich that for the most part is better then the rest.  A few nights ago, I found myself at Capriotti's waiting over twenty minutes for my sandwich to be made right.  You can read that review, but it made me think about all the different Cheese Steaks sandwiches in the area.    There are no Geno's or Pat's nearby that could take their crown; but I've always found Jersey Mike's and Corleone's on Northsight have done a better job then most.  And, I really don't mean that as a back handed complement.  This afternoon, I stopped by and ordered a 8\" Big Kahuna Cheese Steak to see if my memory and/or my stomach was playing tricks on me.  And, for the most part, I would say that Jersey Mike's does a great job.  I paid $7.25 for the sandwich, and another $2.19 for chips and a drink.  The total came to $10.32, which is a full dollar cheaper then Capriotti's; and there I didn't get chips for my $11.53.    Now, granted their sub was 12\" to Jersey Mike's 8\", but Mike's was just as good!  Though admittedly I have a weakness for Capriotti's bread with their corn meal bottoms.  Not being from Philly and not wanting to tread on somebody else turf (and Cheese Whiz aside), but I'm going to give Jersey Mike's Four Stars to Capriotti's Three and half Stars.  Enjoy!  ***Don't forget to ask for the \"stamp card\", so you can record your visit ***"}
{"text":"always fresh, always delish! Service is friendly and welcoming. Each service person can answer any question. we are always happy with our food. The sandwiches are very reminiscent of how they do subs up north, so Jersey Mike knows their stuff!"}
{"text":"My spouse and I ate here the other day. It was our fI rst time to a Jersey Mike's and Oh boy was that a mistake. The service was great and friendly.   Food was bland tasteless and nasty. It was frozen chicken cooked, very watery, no flavor. We bother got two different chicken Philly's. Mine was was meant to be spicy, had no spice to it and the other was a normal chicken Philly. Both was bland and tasteless. The chips and drink was the only flavor to the meal.   We will not eat there again or to another Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at the food court at Luke AFB and was happy went the store in peoria opened.  The sandwich I tried was nothing like the one at LukeAFB.. Meat was overly salted and rather skimpy.  Glad i used the coupon."}
{"text":"Great place and awesome customer service. People are always friendly with a  smile and get the orders right. I am a faithful customer to that location  and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I really like this Jersey Mike's a great deal. The staff is friendly overall.  The food is always fresh. It's clean and well lit. There are three TVs running to keep you entertained.  Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to grab a quick bite in the Gold Hill ~ 160 area, this is one to avoid.  Unless of course, you would like poor customer service and ownership that does not support family values."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, but with a menu sporting words like prosciuttini, cappacuolo, and salami, I can at least reasonably pretend that I'm at an old-world Italian deli. I also like the fact that the default condiments are old school: onions, lettuce, tomatoes, vinegar, oil and spices (aka \"Mike's Way\"). The super sub (#5) was delish. I like the fact that they sliced the cheese right in plain view. I'm a long-time Jimmy John's fan, but if there was a Jersey Mike's closer to my home, JJ would have some serious competition.   A few minor criticisms: price is a little high compared to Jimmy Johns. The #5 was $7.25 for a regular sized sub  - almost two dollars more than a JJ Vito. Second, the place lacks personality or warmth, at least compared to JJ's. It's more akin to Subway in this regard.   Service was prompt and friendly, and the bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"Came here over edc weekend wanted to grab a quick sandwich before the event. I ordered a number 7 mini which is turkey sandwich and my boyfriend got a club sandwich.   WOW YOU NEED NEW STAFF THE GIRL MAKING THE SANDWICHES SEEMS TO VIEW THE CUSTOMERS ALWAYS WRONG!    She messed up my order and Bc wasn't paying attention the cashier told her she did the wrong meat, the sandwich girl says right in front of me well she saw me making it and she didn't even say anything.. Like okay rude!   Then bc she had switched the meats my boyfriend asked her nicely if his club got switched too, she looks at him and said doesn't this look like a club to you? Sorry lady wow we don't make sandwiches as our job. If we did we would know.   I was in shock when this whole thing happend I wanted to tell her to eat them herself we don't want them anymore after how rude she was . I couldn't even speak I was so shocked. We paid and ate them we were in a rush.   Suggestion! Don't fight in front of customers and don't be a sarcastic you know what to them either ! This girl needs to be fired!"}
{"text":"Great subs! Love the meatball parm! Staff is helpful and friendly and the owner is a very nice man! Great way to support local business owners! Shop is very clean too!"}
{"text":"Food reviews are sometimes about timing but I stopped by with a friend for lunch. Location was well located if you live in Central Phoenix, but it's the food that matters and really all I can rate it is a \"meh\". Growing up in Europe (call me a sandwich snob) I have yet t go to a place that serves the same quality bread and baguettes that one finds in Europe and would rank Dilly's Deli and Sacks, Sliver Mine subs or even Port of Subs above Jersey Mike's. Only the cardboard tasting bread of a Subway ranks below it imho. I wanted to like it but the bread was very similar to Subway, very light in flavor and not too good. If size matters (I did get the 15 inch one, and had it for lunch and dinner, but wouldn't call it a great value either). The ingredients were decent but when it comes to restaurants, or even fast food if you want to call it that, I want to leave wanting to come back. With Jersey Mike's, I didn't get this. Edible and ok if I had to , but not only my \"to go\" list for sandwiches."}
{"text":"This establishment stands out among sub places because they are the only place near Dilworth that cuts the meat and cheese fresh as you order it.  And the staff is exceptionally extraordinary because if you go more than a couple of times they remember exactly what you like and just how you want it and they ALWAYS great you with a wonderful and friendly welcome every time!"}
{"text":"Wow, reviews all over the board! I went for lunch and got a Regular Italian Mike's way. The amount of meat was perfect.  Thin? Yes...but there was plenty. The lettuce was fresh today as someone else mentioned. The bread was very good and fresh. (I was in around 11:00AM so that helps). The vinegar was tasty, yes I agree, there are some vinegars that taste better than others....they have good vinegar here. Overall, not the best I have ever had, but it is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Yummy.  Apparently these are more in Cali but one showed up here and it's pretty darn good.  Much better than Subway and Quiznos... and you can have your sub all as a sandwich.  It was HUGE!  The seasoning is pretty great and they have oil and vinegar and their vinegar is pretty good.  Yes, you can have nasty tasting vinegar and good tasting vinegar. :)  It's pretty darn worth the trip."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad experience here until today. The staff was attentive when we walked in, but proceeded to mess up two out of three sandwiches. My friend was eating here for the first time and when she was asked if she wanted it mikes way, she asked what it was. The female supervisor with glasses rolled her eyes and rudely went through \"mikes way\". She drenched the sandwich in oil and vinegar and put someone elses sandwich topping on it. When they were asked to fix it, theres was more attitude and a battle of he said she said between the customers and staff about the order which is pretty unprofessional."}
{"text":"Terrible. I ordered a meatball sub. When i opened the wrap it was filled with sause.the bun was drenched and soggy.the meatball was worse then hamburger helper. Mush no taste.yuck .luke warm and tiny peice of cheese.disgusting"}
{"text":"This new Jersey Mike's location is solid. The staff were friendly and the sub was the delicious cheesesteak I was expecting. My only complaints are minor: the outside entrance area is kind of convoluted with stairs and walkways, and the parking isn't amazing (shared with the new Harris Teeter). But as I said, these are minor complaints that pale in comparison to the benefit of getting more food options in the area."}
{"text":"First time here, it's very cramped and the staff seems disorganized. They seem to lack communication about the order. We had three sandwiches and one was part of a kids meal but they never acknowledged the kids meal again, we had to ask.. We got everything and the food tasted good but while we ate the atmosphere stayed chaotic. I heard one staff member say  \"who else has a hot sandwich, here's a hot sandwich\" and then another server came table to table asking \"Is this your other sandwich?\""}
{"text":"Very tasty subs. The Big Kahuna was awesome, the jalepenos give it a nice kick. They made a small mistake with my order and we're happy to correct it.  The place was jam packed when I got there and the line moved about as quickly as it possible could.  I hope they keep up the good pace and quality ingredients.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried Jersey Mike's for the first time today. I got the mini #8 Mike's way minus tomatoes on white. This sandwich more than filled me up for lunch.  It had a great flavor, everything seemed fresh, and the bread was great.  The people working there were so nice. The only complaint is the location.  It's not directly off of Chandler blvd and it's next to a Starbucks.  So once you figure out how to get to it, you have to deal with all the cars going to the Starbucks drive thru."}
{"text":"The fat over weight girl at the front was mean and snobby. She told me to wait my turn when I was the only one on the line. I waited 5 minutes standing there while 2 others had their back turned to me. She has ZERO customer service skills and needs to be taught right or fired."}
{"text":"Their sanitation score is an 86.5. Im not sure if it was the food or anxiety from the score that made me sick after I left. Needless to say I dont have any intention in going back there for a while. :("}
{"text":"I see nothing special about Jersey Mikes (never had them before coming to Charlotte)the sandwich was...okay for 1/2 the price they charge... I went today is because it's raining and I work in the building and didn't feel like walking down the street (should have though). - Sandwiches are nothing special and OVER PRICED!!! - Rude cashier - Rushed/rude topping guy I won't waste my money there again ... I'll go to Subway down the street and get a better sandwich \"MY WAY\" along with chips and a drink and save myself a couple bucks over 'just a sandwich' made \"MIKES WAY\"... I won't be going back that's for sure..."}
{"text":"I love sub sandwiches and Jersey Mike's does it right. The bread is perfect and the onions are amazing. And that's a lot coming from a girl with a long history of hating onions. The guys that work there are super fast and do a great job. (I never get that Subway feeling like they are trying to skimp on toppings) It's the type of place that you would miss if you left town."}
{"text":"Whoever is writing 4 and 5-star reviews for this restaurant must be a friend or relative or employee of Jersey Mike's or its owner. Every time I go to Jersey Mike's (this time will be my last), they come up with a new way to slice their meat even thinner than the last time. I think they're down to single cell thickness now and soon we'll be getting virtual sandwiches that don't really exist. We'll all just look like mimes pretending to eat a sub sandwich that isn't really there.  On top of the fact that they give you mainly just a lot of mayo and lettuce on a bun for your money, the straws were all over the counter, and there were no lids for the drink cups. The table at the entrance was too close to the next tier of tables so you couldn't even get through to sit down and had to walk around. Who manages this place? No one, apparently. One review had it right: \"Jersey Mike's blows...\""}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! !! The staff is super friendly even during a crazy lunch hour!!  Couldn't ask for a better lunch spot"}
{"text":"A great sandwhich place.  Much better than Subway.  They have hot and cold subs.  I love their Chicken Parm sub and the Italian.  They have a giant size for all you hungry folks too.  The employees  there are also really nice and freindly.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for lunch today  Star 1 is for the food quality. I got the chipotle cheesesteak which was to die for. I love how they cook their meat fresh in front of you and their bread is amazing.  Star 2 is for the excellent service. Everyone at this location was very kind and helpful.  Star 3 is for the atmosphere. We ate at one of the tables outside because it was a beautiful day. The inside was nice too.  Star 4 is for the food being worth the price. The total cost for both of our sandwiches was $16 which was very reasonable considering the freshly cooked steak, peppers, and onions.  Star 5 is for the WOW factor. The wow factor with this one is how delicious the subs were here. I already want another one 4 hours later."}
{"text":"It just didn't work.  I'm all about customer service and I know that everyone has their niche in the service game. But when I walk to the counter and the manager/owner (I'm assuming) says \"#13 Regular, Mikes way\" without any greeting or acknowledgement that I'm there (he was staring at his little notepad) I know we're going to have a problem. No, kind sir, that not only isn't what I want, but nothing on the menu sounds worse, thanks for asking...I guess some people like that sarcastic, I-know-what-you-want type personality, but I'm not one of them. (yelling) I know what (yelling again) I want!!  So now let's get to the food that just outright stunk. I ordered a Chicken Cheesesteak (not the #13 that the proprietor so graciously offered). My order is basic, chicken cheesesteak, just meat & provolone cheese, add mayo. The chicken is overcooked, the bread is just gnarly, and they use some other white cheese that is anything but provolone. Gotta love it when you take your lunch back to your dining area of choice to come across a botched order. No bueno.   I've had Mikes when it's been pretty good, but this location isn't that great and it will be a long while before I return - maybe if they put one of those \"under new management\" signs I'll go back sooner than later."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's came highly recommended so I thought I would give it a try.  Ordered a wrap and stood off to the side waiting ...... and waiting ....  and waiting!  There were two other customers. Finally got my order -- only to discover it wasn't close to what I ordered.  I went back one more time to give them the benefit of the doubt. Wrong order--AGAIN!  Once is a mistake, twice is habit. Won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Worst sub place EVER! When we arrived, it wasn't too busy, but somehow the employees were already behind. We finally placed our order after waiting for five minutes. I ordered the club sub and my husband ordered the buffalo chicken cheese steak. My order was ready pretty quickly. However, they hadn't even started on my husband's yet. So we waited, and waited, and waited. We saw the guy behind us get his complete order of five or six sandwiches and still my husband was waiting. He finally told the employee he didn't want the sandwich anymore. Her \"excuse\" was that they just grab the tickets and don't pay attention to the order they're in. Really?!!! What a wasted of time and money!"}
{"text":"When this location opened I was excited because I love Jersey Mike's. Well came here once good service..  -the second time we were told that we could only get cold sandwiches because they were cleaning the grill.. so understood..  -third time; told we could only get hot sandwiches because that is the type of bread they had. First off WTH Is the difference between the breads! I assumed it was the same shit. So we left and so did another customer..  -fourth time and Final!- today. Walked in and no one was in the front. So we waited a few and still nothing. The guy even saw my husband from the back window and nothing. So we left again.  Since it is a franchise I feel sorry for the store owner since this place is always empty and yet they seem to be having employee issues.. definitely not going back.."}
{"text":"Yea, I gave a chain sandwich place 5 stars.  So?  I've been eating JMike's for years, and at this particular location for 3 years I think.  They haven't disappointed, once.  They do just as good a job on the grilled subs as the cold subs.  I think its only fitting that the owners name is Mike."}
{"text":"Drive to Copperfield instead.  Owners here are no good.  Staff at Copperfield location build a great sandwich."}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying the 2 stars is because I love jersey mikes in general but this location sucks and it's just because of one unhappy cash register lady the usual staff with the gentleman is amazing sandwich is on point but if you want a bad sandwich super soggy and a bunch of rude grunts and remarks go see the giant white girl she literally didn't ask what I wanted on my sandwich but when I ask for some red sauce she gave me attitude like if I asked for a kidney I guess I ordered a sandwich on sale one and she handed me a cup I asked oh did the sandwich come with a meal she ridiculed me like if I should know if you having a bad day leave it at the door if you don't want to work be grateful you have a job if your just racist then that's a personal problem"}
{"text":"I discovered jersey Mike's about a month ago. It is a combination of things that make JMS a good bet....great customer service, clean dining room and bathroom, fresh bread, and quality ingredients all come together to make this a great place for a delicious sandwich. They are MILES above subway...not even in the same league,actually..I asked for the names of the two guys that are normally there when I go in,so I could mention then in this review, but I misplaced the paper that I wrote them on...you know who you are, keep up the good work. A lot can be said for customer service, and that is a big part of what makes this place great. Yes, the subs are a little bit more than other places but the quality of the food and overall experience will make up for that, no problem."}
{"text":"Somewhat uninspired standard chain-feel sandwich shop.  Shredded lettuce type sandwich, nothing gourmet here folks.  They cut the meat to order, but it's definitely not high quality meat or anything special.  Their breads ALL contain high fructose corn syrup.  Their mayo contains high fructose corn syrup.  ( http://www.jerseymikes.com/nutritional-information.asp ).  Even Subway's white bread and mayo don't have HFCS in it.  Cutting corners on every possible ingredient?   That's enough to make me never want to go back.  Overpriced for the quality you're getting.  Sorry Mike."}
{"text":"Absolute best sub in Las Vegas. Fresh baked bread, fresh sliced deli meat, generous with the toppings.   Be sure to join the Jersey Mike's Shore Points loyalty club. They've made it super convenient as they give you a card, have your phone number on file, and have an available app. I can track my points, check nutritional information, and even scan my account information from my phone.   The only thing better than the food is the customer service. I've received great service from every location, but this one surpasses them all. I've never encountered an unpleasant associate!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place but it has declined.  Picked up 3 sandwiches last week.  They have become very stingy on how much meat they put on a sandwich; a few pieces that are paper thin.  The lettuce was floating in water; the employee had to squeeze it before putting it on the sandwich.  The grill was broken and the employee did not pay enough attention to what I wanted on the sandwiches.  Almost $40.00 later....."}
{"text":"This is a sub done right. Got a #2 \"mike's way\" and it was great. Fresh bread and toppings, and their vinaigrette is excellent. You could pay less at subway, but this a far better choice."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have had Jersey Mike\"s a couple of times and so far we are very impressed. Subs are a food group to him, so I take his opinion very seriously.  The folks that work at Mike's actually take the time to put your sandwich together nicely with a ton of veggies and meat.  It is not like some of the other sub chains where they are trying to play beat the clock and smash your food together with little care or courtesy so you end up with a flat messy sandwich.  The bread is great and the veggies are fresh and ripe, no green tomatoes and wilted lettuce here.  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is really dirty.   So bad that even the credit card machine is screaming for a good wipe down.   DO NOT LOOK AT THE GRILL, ignore the old onions under the slicer, and for the sake of your sanity, pay no attention to the old, dry food between the meat in the display case.     The staff is a little clueless which is probably why cleaning is not high on their priority list.    This is one of my favorite sandwich chains, this used to be one of my favorite locations.     Someone help get it clean please."}
{"text":"I love this chain.   Not this store.    2 people staffed on a Saturday during lunch isn't enough.  The staff was more interested in arguing about how to charge me for my sandwich than making it.  Kept pushing me to have my sandwich Mike's Way.   My name is not Mike and I want it my way.    Here is a hint.   Use only enough oil to make the sandwich moist.   I am not trying to lube a car.    Train the staff better and teach them some manners please."}
{"text":"Mr Manager.   Take note.   Your shop needs a good cleaning.   Napkin holders are dirty.  The outside furniture needs to be scrubbed.   The drink machine and ice marker are dirty on the outside and I don't want to think about the inside.   Good food but it is hard not to think about what is behind the counter when the customer area isn't great."}
{"text":"I've been going there since I work at Fairview Hospital. The Big Kahuna is the best I have ever had. I just hope that they can be in Strongsville soon. I know when they see this post they will know me. Very friendly and goes extra mile to please their customers."}
{"text":"The food quality was OK, nothing special. I may have gone back again, I don't know. But the main thing is that there was a counter woman who was not nice to my niece. She's never been there before . . .we don't know the \"Jersey Mike's system\" and have no idea what you are supposed to say, or how you order. This nasty woman behind the counter starts in on my niece with a terrible attitude. We won't be back, for sure.  Edited on August 11. Tried them again, subs were great. Manager apologized. I think the issue here is that they expect you to know about \"Mike's Way\" and for a newbie, you know nothing. Some people don't like to feel like they know nothing . . . Upped to 3 stars."}
{"text":"In the fast food sandwich market there are many choices based on taste and your pocketbook. Take Jersey Mike's for instance. They are an east coast brand that has been making it's trek west for a few years now. On a recent visit I ordered their Original Italian w/ extra meat and a small soda which came to $12.29. The sandwich was very tasty and came on a 8\" or so size sub.   I've tried various Jersey Mike's along the west coast and they are all uniformly good, Ray Kroc would be proud.  What makes Mike's unique is the grilling of your meat for you Sub.  They have both a Philly and Hawaiian options, etc.   The quality of the meats and sub bread seem above average as the prices reflect, but still a good sub!    ***Don't forget to ask for the \"stamp card\", so you can record your visit ***"}
{"text":"Really friendly employees, at first! But it was very clear that the one making sandwiches was relatively new. He did not have much knowledge of the ordering process, ingredients, etc... management/training was lacking & not entirely his fault, but he also seemed to know he was unaware & continued without hesitation.   While the conversation was friendly with checking out- I did notice there was suddenly an \"issue\" after paying when preparing my order. None of what I had asked for was noted or taken into account. Had I not noticed, it would have been their choice of bread, 0 condiments, just meat & cheese. Asked, \"can I add some condiments & toppings to that?\"... I think it may have come out as \"correcting\" because the response seemed like I was being a bother or picky... but I just wanted some mayo & lettuce!   It started out friendly & pleasant. Just kind of went downhill when the new employee needed some direction and asking for ingredients ordered seemed to come off in a negative way.   Needless to say, I went home with dinner that was not really what I had initially ordered, somewhat thrown together at that point. I went to this location because the one prior was completely out of bread. That happens & I appreciated the coupon they kindly offered... but this second location would not even accept the coupon! Not sure why. They wanted to make SURE I signed up for a rewards account but rejected their own advertising.   A bit disappointing. I had tried the location in Chandler not long ago, for the first time. Which is why I wanted to go back- it was GOOD! I guess I'll stick to the location nearest work from now on."}
{"text":"Convenient how this employee neglected to ring in my purchase under their name... because they were probably the most rude & arrogant I have ever encountered.   11/17/17 at 8:37pm your employee was helping ONE customer prior to myself, who had just walked in. Your employee then walked AWAY from the counter. Did not acknowledge me whatsoever. Did not say, \"one moment please\". No \"hello\". NOTHING.  Another employee was mopping the floor. And another was standing in the back watching. For FIFTEEN MINUTES I stood there waiting for even ONE employee to acknowledge me! I walked in at 8pm.... the restaurant closes at 9pm. It took until 8:23 to even be acknowledged!   No idea why I even bothered to sit & wait after that total disrespectful bs. ...big shock the order came out entirely wrong. And going back to ask it to be fixed is hopeless when it already took THIRTY MINUTES to get ONE sandwich out of THREE employees who all have 0 regard for customer service.   It was obvious the one at the counter was \"in charge\". And was terrible. I pointed out (POLITELY, mind you, regardless of their demeanor) that cleaning should have been put aside for AFTER assisting customers & a simple acknowledgement of presence would have made ALL the difference between standing there being ignored for the majority of the experience. Got a nice, \"sorry we get a head start on closing and you can go next door if you don't want to wait.\" WOW...   So, it is safe to say the one responsible for this \"team\" tonight at closing was a total inconsiderate witch. Can't say I will visit this location again. It is more than worth it to drive the extra 15 minutes (had to wait longer than that, anyway) to actually be acknowledged & respected at the BETTER location in Glendale!   Bell Road in Surprise needs a massive attitude adjustment, lesson in customer service- basically fix that girl with the poor attitude & get someone in there who can lead your other employees by a GOOD example! Total trash experience & I'm pissed I just got charged for a wrong order after waiting nearly 30 minutes for ONE sandwich because your counter lead had a bad attitude & crap for courtesy/care.   You may want to instruct them to begin closing at 9pm, AFTER business hours. Not push out & neglect customers who come in prior. We all just got off work, too, and had to wait to do so until our responsibilities were met... why do the employees at this location get to be above hours of business & make their own schedule?! You are basically paying this employee to purposely ignore customers in order to close ASAP on the dot at 9pm so as not to interrupt THEIR own PERSONAL schedule (overheard that one!). This person should not be there if they cannot adhere to the business world & standards. Especially the customer service industry.   There is no reason I should have had to wait until 8:23 to even PLACE my order when I walked in the door at 8pm but was entirely ignored while others were helped then closing procedures promptly took place an hour prior to close of business. I mean, even a simple, \"one moment please & we'll be with you\" would have made the difference between being flat out ignored & made to feel an insignificant bother!   Really, I have had better experiences at McDonalds in comparison. At least they acknowledge you!"}
{"text":"I am giving it one star solidly based on the customer service that I received. I really like Jersey Mike's and I drove out of my way to get my subs here. I'm not going to use this platform to talk about my bad experience with the employee. Just be warned that there is an male employee that is completely disrespectful."}
{"text":"overpriced and just deli meat, nothing special"}
{"text":"Ordered through their app and sandwiches weren't made until an hour after I placed it. The employee told me the manager made a policy that they can't make online orders until the line is clear.  Needless to say I had to wait for two baseball teams to get their orders made before they would begin mine.  VERY bad customer service.  Will never step into another Jersey Mikes again."}
{"text":"Great flavor and you have mini sub rolls.  The sub roll size offering alone gives you five stars.  I really liked my sub, tuna on white Mike's way, but really do not need to be eating a huge portion of it.  Everything was delicious, the store was clean, and nice employees."}
{"text":"I come here a lot. Sometimes once a week. This is really close to my house and it definitely tops subway and firehouse subs in my opinion. The food here is really consistent. Seriously, I've never had a bad or unpleasant sandwich. I've ventured through most of the menu and it's solid.   The only negative for me is this location is usually busy and they tend to be understaffed which makes waiting times over 20 minutes. If you're a person like me who has worked in food service before you won't complain and just understand that it's probably not the working employees fault on that, and you'll be a nice customer still. Even though I've been in here PLENTY of times when the wait time was long because only two people were juggling orders for a line that goes to the door, I have really never had \"rude\" workers. Maybe I'm just lucky but they always seem to be pleasant. Gotta give credit where it's due."}
{"text":"Fresh sliced meat, and sandwiches made to order. This place may not have all the bells and whistles of some of the big chain sandwich places, but for the money, the quality can't be beat."}
{"text":"Food and service is fine, after all this is a chain. Big problem here is ADA accessibility. They have handicap accessible restrooms, but there's no way to get a wheelchair into that part of the restaurant. There a booth which is too close to the drink counter.   If a person who needed accessibility could go out one set of doors onto the patio, with the intent to return through the door near the restrooms, access is blocked on the patio."}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mike's in general. I'm from Jersey and they even kept the sub# from my favorite sub shop growing up. But this shop???  If I walk in and see the manager that was there the other day and \"addressed\" my complaint, I will walk out!  I ordered a \"whole\" #7. Got home and discovered a half. Apparently there is no such thing as a whole. There is a mini, regular, and giant. (To my way of thinking if you have to cut the bread it's not a whole!)  No problem. A simple misunderstanding. And that's what the manager told me. She'd be happy to make me another \"regular\". I said great and I'd be happy to pay the difference. Oh no!!!  \"You only get the price of the Giant (whole) sub if you order it at the time!\"  I did!  I tried reasoning with her but there was no reasoning.   I asked to speak to a manager and she assured me she was a manager. I told her she'd never be one in my restaurants (6) and that any misunderstanding can be attributed to at least one of at least two parties. In the restaurant world the management should almost always take responsibility for that. It's just that simple.   Instead I paid $8 for another half sub when it should have been $3 for the difference. Does $5 matter that much to a Subway franchisee?  Nope. Does it matter that much to me?  Nope.   But a haughty manager?  That matters a bunch!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here, very nice young man helped us and I hope this is his name Derek. Been there a few times there is one other guy we like but he was not there but we like Derek! Good dude! Very kind.  Good food!"}
{"text":"I went in the early afternoon and got incredibly fast and friendly service.  The food is always good and fresh.  They seem to have a lot of turnover in employees, so I never see the same face twice, but the food certainly doesn't seem to suffer.  They even secret menu options ... if that's something you enjoy  :-)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for this type of place and the staff is attentive and polite. The food quality is the best of all the Jersey Mikes my family and I have eaten at over the years and this is due to the franchise owner having all the ingredients available, unlike other locations. The staff ALWAYS loads up on the portions so you will come away satisfied. I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"The subs are delicious as always, but the staff is too unprofessional and it really drags this new location down. They also seem to have a bread issue frequently which results in the whole staff looking at each other asking about wheat availability...strange. In the end, they haven't messed up my orders too much for me to not recommend them in a pinch..."}
{"text":"Way over priced.  I now remember why I never returned to Jersey Mike's.  Their pricing is out of this world.  $7.00, $8.00 and $14.00 for a small, medium or large sandwich.  I ordered my sandwich and it was average.  At these prices, I expected something special.  What a disappointment.  Save your money and find a more reasonable place to eat."}
{"text":"I really like the grilled veggie wrap. They are very quick with sandwich prep which makes them a good stop for a lunch break. They carry pepsi products n vitamin water. Most of the staff here are very nice. The line is never too long, either. They have a variety of chips for a side (and I think I've seen cookies)."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's makes really good sandwiches. There's one by my house I visit here and there, and it's always really good!   Today, though, my co worker went to this location on 55th St and Broadway, to pick up lunches for us. She submitted the order online and went to pick it up. I ordered a vegetarian sandwich and she specified that I wanted no green peppers and to have them put avocado, tomatoes, lettuce, and light mayo on it. They got the cheese right, and the lettuce and the light mayo. But I see no avocado and no tomatoes. I don't care enough to complain, but my friend calls the store to let them know they messed the order up. She requested a manager and spoke with Peter.   She told Peter what happened and Peter said he personally made the sandwich and he knows it was made correctly. She said again, there is no avocado or tomato on it and I'm eating a lettuce and cheese sandwich. He says he put a light spread of avocado on it, so I open the sandwich up and see what looks like he wiped the knife on my bread after spreading avocado on another sandwich. I tell her this goes NOT count as avocado and he says he didn't charge me for it. That doesn't matter to me. I asked for avocado... I wanted avocado whether I paid for it or not! Ridiculous!   Anyway, my co worker was offered the opportunity to drive BACK to the store and EXCHANGE my half-eaten sandwich for a correct sandwich. This offer is not reflective of good customer service. Like I said, I didn't care enough to complain, but after she did, I am disgusted by the manager's attitude. He told her she had to return with the sandwich to get a correct one because he doesn't know if she was \"just saying\" that the sandwich was incorrectly made. I don't know what other place would ask someone to take a second lunch break to EXCHANGE a sandwich that THEY made incorrectly, while also suggesting that the customer was LYING about the sandwich HE MADE HIMSELF.   I absolutely don't recommend this place. The food is great when they make it right, but maybe only eat here if you are going to actually eat IN the store so you can get any issues corrected right then and there. Horrible customer service, Peter!"}
{"text":"My first Jersey Mike's experience was a box lunch at a volunteer event, and I wasn't impressed.  So it took a while for me to check it out again.  After eating way too much for a week in Vegas, we stopped by on the way out of town, and I'm so glad we did.  Much better than other fast food sandwich joints, the bread was fresh, the meat was thinly sliced, and I enjoyed my meal.  Since I don't get veggies, it was a little weird having the oil and vinegar sprayed on the meat instead of on the bread (making for a messy experience), but that's the worst thing I could say about the meal.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I'm from New Jersey and this place is not so New Jersey. New Jersey is known for there tomatoes and therefore we love our ketchup. With that being said, I ordered a cheesesteak. Come to find out they don't carry ketchup. WTF! A cheesesteak without ketchup is like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without jelly. My wife had the ranch bacon chicken cheesesteak and the ranch was just watery and got all over the place. I hate to say we will not be attending Jersey Mikes again. But Capriotti's or Which Wich are great selections if your looking for traditional east coast style hoagies and sandwiches."}
{"text":"From east coast to west coast. . Jersey Mike's always a good sandwich!"}
{"text":"Wow. I was having a crappy morning of government red tape at the VA hospital. On my way home I saw the sign for Jersey Mike's and figured I'd grab a sub on my way back to work. The guys in there could not have been nicer. Friendly, funny and infinitely generous. The cheese and meat were cut fresh, which I *LOVE*, so the sub was tasty and the portions ample. The staff went above and beyond to turn my day around with their smiles, great customer service and a little lunch surprise that was totally unexpected. Much appreciated. I will go out of my way to go back to this location!!"}
{"text":"First off, I really hoped I would like this place, because I crave good sandwiches, and I absolutely hate Subway.    My daughter said she was done with over half a sandwich left, I was just like, \"There's no way you're telling me you're full off of a couple of bites.\"    She leaned over and whispered, \"It's not good, take a bite and see for yourself.\"  I did, and it was disgusting.  We think it was the mayo; it tasted like formaldehyde, which brought back dissecting memories from childhood, I almost puked.  I spit my bite out and told her to throw it away.    I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak.  The guy behind the counter was very friendly, talking about how their cheesesteaks are the best and win awards.  I tried it, and it was pretty bad, I couldn't even finish my sandwich.  After a few bites, I threw mine away as well.  Unfortunately, we didn't like it and would not go back."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome!!!  Fast service good quality food. The people there were very helpful and the food was outstanding. Ample quantity and they didn't skimp on the meat which is pretty common at places like this.  The veggies are always fresh and the price is spot on to where it should be for a sandwich like that."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fresh ingredients, this will be your place. They are a little bit pricey than other sandwich places, but it is always worth it. They are very  attentive and one of the girls that works there always knows what I want. It is always good to know that they are paying attention to what customers want. Never had a problem with them. Very friendly and always clean! ;-)"}
{"text":"Nice to see that there is more competition in the sandwich game then just subway. Jersey Mike's is a more upscale sandwich joint with more fresh meat and bread to adorn their tasty creations. I visited today during the lunch time rush, I agree with what others have said it's a tad small inside the shop but luckily i had my sandwich to go. The crew was friendly but the wait was a tad long considering how many folks they have on staff, perhaps it takes a while to get in the groove. I ordered a chipotle cheese steak which was quite tasty and the bread which is baked in store was perfect as well as the ingredients."}
{"text":"Always love it.  I've been to them in the northeast and here in AZ.  Food is consistent and great and staff is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant chain and it certainly won't be my last!  Yes, it's a little pricier than it's competitors, but the sandwiches are HUGE (as well as fresh and tasty) and I feel like I got excellent value for the money.    The service was prompt and the staff was friendly. The place was immaculately clean (even in the midst of lunch rush) -- and I'm a stickler about that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Nothing crazy here, just got a wrap.  I've had the chicken parm at another location and was really craving that but I passed.  Good enough but not too awesome."}
{"text":"This is probably the lowest Jersey Mike's rating I've ever given.  Two things rubbed me really wrong about my visit here.  First was the owner/manager's attitude.  He said something to my wife about her order, I forget what it was exactly... trying to be funny I guess, but it came off in a total d-bag style.  Second thing was the kid ringing up our order.  He looked about 10. Aren't there some sort of child labor laws, or does anything go in Vegas?"}
{"text":"I'm so bummed there's not a Jersey Mike's in Tucson, but everytime I drive up to Phoenix and need a quick meal, Jersey Mike's is where I go.  I love how fresh the ingredients are - the ingredients are much more high quality than Subway or Eegees.  That's the main reason I love it - the amazingly fresh ingredients.  Otherwise it's your typical sub sandwich place."}
{"text":"In my \"work\" neighborhood, first time trying this brand.  Very pleased! clean, quick, fresh, tasty, will defiantly be having another sandwich here again.  Something different than Subway, and I do not eat Jimmy Johns, ever!   So this is a refreshing difference."}
{"text":"The employees were pleasant and that's where it ends. We ordered 3 different subs, all less than mediocre and more than overpriced. Stale bread is unacceptable!!Mike must be here because they tossed his subs out of Jersey!"}
{"text":"Best Roast beef around! Friendly staff, just be cautious of coming here around noon/lunch time because you could be waiting in line for most of your lunch break. Other than that the subs are always great!"}
{"text":"I rarely give reviews, but was the Worst experience I have had at this location.  Food placed on counter, service with an attitude. Won't frequent again, or if I do won't be when the same staff present."}
{"text":"Picked up an order here last night after leaving work. Place was very clean with extremely friendly staff.  I would definitely come here again if I get the hankering for a cheesesteak on the way home from work again!"}
{"text":"Wow, really dirty. Everything from the credit card machine to the drink dispenser to every.single.table was dirty. The floor was also really dirty. Empty bucket sat on the floor next to the wall. The store wasn't busy - no customers in line after me - and the cashier walked out to get a drink and completely ignored the straw wrappers and other garbage strewn around the area instead of taking 5 seconds to clean it up.  Sandwich was ok. But this is Arizona - is it really that hard to know how to roll a wrap sandwich so the ends aren't open and it's not falling apart?  Staff were all pleasant and polite - just didn't seeem to notice or care that the dining area was is complete shambles."}
{"text":"From the friendly staff to the fresh sliced meats and veggies - my experience at Jersey Mike's is always spot on. Today I tried the roast beef and it was outstanding! I still can't get over how soft and tasty the bread always is - made fresh daily! I would've posted a picture but I was too hungry!!"}
{"text":"Update on last review. Owner reached out to me through a personal message. I called and spoke with him on the phone. He apologized multiple times and informed me that the manager that I had dealt with no longer works at the store. He also said that jersey mikes has very strict standards when it comes to making sandwiches and salads. Dan (the owner) offered to buy my lunch or dinner next time that I was there. Dan was a super nice guy when I spoke with him and I'm happy he reached out to me because I love jersey mikes and was very upset that I had an experience like I did. Can't wait to go back to one of my favorite sandwich shops."}
{"text":"What can I say? I am really impressed by their business, last week we got two regular subs, when we got home we noticed that it seemed to be lacking in meat and the cheese was non-existent on one and paper thin on the other. The subs were still good, but it was disappointing and I sent my concern off to Jersey Mike's. Within a couple of hours the manager of the location I had this experience called me.  She offered to treat my family to a sub dinner for our trouble. That is obvious commitment to quality service. The subs were fantastic this time. Turns out they were actually having issues with the slicer the day I went.   They will get my business again, their subs are tasty, with quality ingredients, and they are committed to customer service. Yes their prices are a bit higher then a place like subway, but you do get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I had the turkey sub on wheat and it was delish!!! The manager and the 3 girls working were polite, friendly and fast with my order. Will most definitely do for lunch again."}
{"text":"It's hard to mess up a sub. Are they amazing in taste? No, but they're not disgusting, so I don't have a problem stopping by for a sub when the urge for one moves me. Their bread to me isn't the best, not a complaint but just my opinion. The staff is efficient and work well together."}
{"text":"Jersey mikes used to be one of my fav sub shops. The service has REALLY gone downhill. A year or so ago they had some of the best customer service.. They would greet you upon entering and small talk with you, not to mention they would make your subs in a TIMELY manner.   I went there on Saturday and there was a mom and son in line in front me me. Great i thought! I beat the rush! ... Or not.  The gal slicing the meats who is the first person to take your order, doesn't even register that there are people standing here waiting to order. She must have been doing an online order because she was just chopping those meats up without a care in the world.  Finally after literally 6 or 7 minutes, she looks up and says \"I'll be right with you\".. Well ok at least she acknowledged us!   It only got worse from there.. The guy putting the condiments on the sandwiches was one of the slowest workers I have ever witnessed. He just couldn't get it together and took a few minutes to put on a few condiments on each sandwich. The lady in front of me turned around and gave me a \"what the hell, this is taking so long\" face.   There was now a line almost out the door and a few people left because it was taking so long.  By the time I got to the register it was about 20 minutes since I came in. 20!! That is ridiculous!  The subs are great I love the food. But for the quality of service and prices, I'll head to jimmy johns where I can be in and out freaky fast."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place because the service was outstanding.  I like that they have a fun selection of sandwiches both hot and cold.  I like that they slice the meat and cheese when you order it instead of having it pre sliced in plastic bins.  I am a vegetarian and the employee even went to the back to slice my cheese on a clean slicer.  It was our first time visiting and they gave us 3 cookies free.  I have to say the peanut butter cookie was my favorite part of the meal.  It was seriously delicious.  There are only really 2 vegetarian options - a cheese and green bell pepper cold sandwich and the same thing basically warmed with cooked veggies.  And you could get it rolled in a wrap instead of on a sub.  I am not a fan of green bell peppers so I was not thrilled off the bat with my choices.  They also have very few sandwich toppings so I couldn't even \"beef\" up the sandwich with things like cucumber, sprouts, avocado, etc.  I sadly don't think I will be back and I was hoping there was finally a restaurant on this corner that I would enjoy.  :("}
{"text":"Best sub spot in the south. The choice of sub size is awesome, the breads are fresh and the veggies are crisp. Two things that keep me from a 5* review... 1. The turkey looks so unappetizing. Granted, it's tastes fine but it looks like raw turkey spam. I'd love to see something a little less meat brick. 2. Sometimes, the oil and vinegar are layered in a different way and the bread gets soggy quickly or somehow it slides off the veggies. I'm no sandwich aficionado but there has to be a better way. To be totally honest, I've never been one to like cold cuts or sandwiches of any kind. Somehow, Jersey Mike's convinced me to broaden my horizons."}
{"text":"By far some of the friendliest workers. Awesome service and great team service. I showed up 10 minutes prior to closing time and it was still a welcoming environment. I suggested to go somewhere else and they insisted i stay regardless how close it was to closing time. I would highly recommend this Jersey Mikes location."}
{"text":"I am usually a fan of Jersey Mikes but today our order for CA Club fell short...I struggled to find the meat. Instead of a delicious club with Turkey, provolone, bacon and Guacamole as a base. I found overcooked bacon, a thin layer of salty meat with barely enough cheese to cover 3/4th of the bun. The rest was lettuce with a skiff of tomato...definitely not Mike's way!  I feel we wasted close to $30 on 2 lg. Sandwiches in our rush to get to work.  Once there we could not return for a remake of our order. I am rethinking if I will return just in case today was a servers bad day. CS has always been a concern but this slip in quality has left us speechless with disappointment.  I wasn't going to comment but decided they need to know."}
{"text":"Many pounds of cold cuts and cheese we have consumed here and continue to love it.  THIS is how the hoagies of my Philadelphia upbringing were in the 1950s.  Order your hoagie with the oil and vinegar rather than the mayo, etc. and you have an original.  I remember my parents coming home with those butcher paper wrapped sandwiches, oil stained and smelling so yummy.  My mother would open them up, slice them into portions and we would sit at the table using the butcher paper for our place mats.  A very nostalgic munching down the gustatory lane to be wiping the oil off of your chin and accepting that what you are wearing is heading to the laundry.  Wife had a BLT the other day and watching the assembly the \"chef\" grabbed literally a hand full of crisp bacon and mushed it on to the roll.  Oh my goodness!  None of that two skimpy slices.  Heck, this is JERSEY, macho land, eat large.  No fru-fru allowed.  Specials each week on one or more of the hoagies.  Park right by the building.  To-go is just fine.  Prices reasonable.  Frequent eater card.  Super friendly staff that are happy you are there."}
{"text":"TIP: Get there around 1130 to avoid the sometimes HUGE lines, especially on Discount Tuesdays!  Love Jersey Mike's subs, but ONLY the COLD subs! I don't know what it is, but their Hot subs (to me anyway) are just not very good. But their cold subs, however, are delicious! Freshly sliced meats, cheese, and veggies, done \"Mike's way\" is delicious!  I love the fact that they make their bread daily too.  Like another Yelper said, this shop is VERY well run, and the staff is very pleasant and efficient....need to be especially to handle the large lunch crowd.  Overall a good choice to get a great COLD sub! My fave is the Original Italian done \"Mike's Way.\""}
{"text":"This is what happens when a biz gets a lot of customers... It becomes a cattle line. Next! Next! Next! Do they care if it's good? If it's right? Well if they do I did not get that impression. 'You move, you don't have to stand there' that's what I was told. It really makes you miss Subway, that's for sure. They don't care if you need to add extra fixings in the sandwich, just go pay for it. Wow! But in the end, the food is what matters, right? Well, if that's the case then, forget 'bout it! The chicken to begin with was totally tasteless. I asked for oil and vinegar, and they put so much vinegar, I could still taste it days later. I asked Siri to remind me not to ever come back to this store... Have it on the calendar  lol - now I only wish I could get my $9 back. I hate to waste money."}
{"text":"I appreciate the people that work here.  They have a gluten free sub roll, and will wipe things down, then use items from the back for people with celiac.  It's a delicious treat for people unable to have sandwiches.  The only feedback I would give is to wipe down the meat slicer with a separate towel BEFORE wiping down the counter (so bread crumbs don't get in the slicer.)"}
{"text":"I wanted to hate Jersey Mike's.  It  looks like a sterile corporate soul sucking building complete with vast parking lot.    We went inside and I appreciate that their menu is short and posted in big enough font to be read from 15 feet away.  What was immediately annoying though was we had no idea where we were supposed to go to order.  I don't like feeling dumb.  Makes my food less tasty.    I ordered a cold turkey sub and my husband got a hot hawaiian philly.  All the employees were friendly but perhaps because of the glass I couldn't understand a word they said.  I ended up getting my sub \"Mikes Way\" because all I could do is smile and nod whenever any of tem spoke to me.  I was HORRIFIED when she started shaking what looked to be gallons of red wine vinegar and oil onto my sub.  She was shaking that thing like I wanted my sub to actually be a red wine soup or something.  SICK!!  So I was understandably nervous that my sandwich was going to be soggy and vinegary and gross.    But...it wasn't.  It was sooooo good.  The bread didn't go soggy, it didn't taste vinegary.  I wished I had gotten a second sandwich so I could've inhaled that one too.  My husband really enjoyed his too.  Thankfully we had a few free sub cards because those two subs would've set us back close to $20.       Points for:  surprisingly delicious food, friendly employees, clean Points off:  PRICE (omg, only going back if someone else is buying), being unable to understand employees   *I gave it one $ because if you are cheap you can get out for less than $10, if you are really hungry or get a whole meal or big sub, you are definitely paying more than $10"}
{"text":"Do you like Jimmy John's or Capriotti's?  This place blows them both out of the water.  The ingredients taste so fresh and the staff is very friendly. A little pricey but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"This Jersey Mike's in Dilworth & on East Blvd. is busy at peak hours & really slow any other time. The staff wants to be helpful, but doesn't seem to be qualified or very well-trained."}
{"text":"Writing reviews that I think are overdue so I'm gonna keep it going with Jersey Mikes, last visited when I was heading out to Philadelphia on Southwest in May 2016. We were a little early for our flight and I was so hungry. I got bored with Burger King and Wendy's (both in concourse C) so I decided to try a new restaurant that I've never tried out before -- Jersey Mikes. It's sort of like Subway and Capriotti's mixed in together, but the sub I had was so delicious!! It was also very close to our assigned gate too. Outstanding service as well!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Chipotle chicken philly and it was delicious! The family got cold subs and they were great too. The meat freshly sliced when you order it. They staff is great too. Make sure you ask for a stamp card to save up for a free sub!"}
{"text":"This franchise has a history with me since it opened with a one out of three visits great.  The other two, not so much.  No consistency.  Sometimes the roast beef is overcooked and dry with a stale bun to go with it and then the next time, GREAT.  Out of soda, out of chips.  Last Saturday at 7:15 pm they were out of buns (the girl said bread) - can you imagine no buns in a sub shop?  They had wraps and salad, I tried to get a wrap with roast beef, guess what, NO ROAST BEEF TOO!  I have to give up on this place, it makes me sad because the other sub shops, Subway and Penn Station, couldn't on the best day be close to Jersey Mike's.  However, this is a waste of my time to even give them another shot."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and service.  The meats are excellent quality, and I think their bread is the best.  I go to this location for lunch at least once a week.  The owners are always here, so things are tip-top.  This is the best Jersey Mikes in Vegas, in my experience."}
{"text":"Best store ever!!! Super friendly, awesome customer service! The manager Michael is the best!!"}
{"text":"This place (all locations) have the best cheesesteaks. I always get the number 56 (I think???) with chipotle mayo, extra onions, and extra mushrooms. So creamy and delicious. Their regular size is big enough to fill someone up. They also slice the cold meats and cheeses right in front of you! I will always recommend their food."}
{"text":"Okay so for my experience.. Absolutely amazing.    The service was amazing. As soon as we walked in, Hillary and Martha gave us the best welcoming. Huge smiles, very outgoing. You can tell they care about their customers! Already very impressed and happy to be there. There was a short line. Told them what I wanted (my usually, #56 no jalapeños, extra onions, extra mushrooms, extra chipotle mayo) and it came out shortly after. I've never been disappointed with any location (I usually go to Warm Springs and Durango since I live there) but this location blew me away so much that we just had to ask for their names.   Now for the food, amazing. So creamy and amazing. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Some may consider my review unfair, since I have not recently ate at this location. I was eating across the parking lot at Habit Burger when three employees from Jersey Mike's came in to eat during their break. They were wearing Jersey Mike's shirts. They were the rudest people in Habit Burger, and were loudly cursing \"F...\" words along with a lot more obscene language. I realize they were not officially representing Jersey Mike's at the time, however, I still choose to boycott this particular Jersey Mike's location due to the extremely rude behavior of their employees."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this jersey mikes subs from day one. This a great place to get food very clean and if something is wrong with your order they always make it right. its a good place to eat a sub and relax and watch tv. They have hot or cold subs my favorite sub is the philly cheese steak they always make it perfect i would recommend coming."}
{"text":"OMG that meatball sub...outstanding. ordered through uber eats, never have had Jersey mikes. the shredded lettuce and the oil and vinegar were just delicious. I had forgotten what a real sub sandwich was like. no more subway, after having this  it seems fake and no taste. thank you!"}
{"text":"Under new ownership, food is still great, the store is cleaner with a much more clean cut staff. Downside with new staff is a lack of \"every body knows your name\" feel the old crew had, but give them some time."}
{"text":"Great food, but kinda steep on pricing. ($1/inch on subs.) Got 1 wrap and 2 regular sized subs for $22!"}
{"text":"So delicious, the boyf. introduced me to this place"}
{"text":"Food is always consistent. 4 starts are for the ever friendly service.   We even came in 15 minutes before closing and didn't feel an ounce of annoyance from the employees."}
{"text":"The four stars say \"yay Im a fan\" but tonight I was not a fan.  My hubs and have eaten here multiple times in the past four years with no complaints until tonight.  I ordered my usual #13, Mikes way.  My sandwich was so wet from the oil and vinegar that I could have rung it out like a kitchen sponge.  I mean come on - this guy really doused this thing!!! I ended up taking the meat and veggies off and eating in without the bread.  Must have been an off night for these guys - we will be back, just next time, please, keep my sandwich a sandwich and not a sopping wet sponge."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's never fails! The man and I came in here to get some cheese steaks. We always get the #56 which is the Big Kahuna Cheese steak. I always get no jalapenos and have them add chipotle mayo. The chipotle mayo adds a really nice flavor to it and makes it so much more creamy! The steak is never dry either. The man got the big kahuna but with chicken instead and the chicken was really good here! It wasn't dry either! And yes I'm surprised because I've had some dry ones in the past at other places haha. The cashier girl was very friendly and didn't seem irritated at all. The man behind the counter was cleaning while we were eating and still started a conversation with us! Great store and nice location. It's right off the 95 on the Rainbow exit. It's in the the Best of the West next to the Chili's! Perfect if you're going shopping in the area and want to swing by. My only complaint is that I wish they (all the stores) would stay open longer! They close from 8-9 every day."}
{"text":"I'd come here all the time. They always knew how to make my cheese steaks just perfectly! I'd always get a number 56 with no jalapeño, extra mushrooms, extra onions, and chipotle mayo. Absolutely perfect. The ruben was amazing too! I love it!"}
{"text":"Seriously yummy sandwiches at a reasonable price! Made fresh right in front of you and way better send some of the other sandwich places locally"}
{"text":"I walked in and the two people working there were extremely friendly. However, they were out of stock on what I was looking for, so I didn't get to try anything."}
{"text":"I go to the shop off the 51 and Bell Road in Scottsdale. Very efficient service. Happy employees. Great manager(young lady with blonde hair) always singing and smiling. Always gets my order correct. Pricy sandwich, yes, but quality ingredients. I'll always return to same store on my way to and from Tucson."}
{"text":"Never been here except for the Tuesday special but that's one helluva deal on a great sandwich"}
{"text":"By far the best sub sandwiches in Charlotte. Super fresh ingredients and plenty of them..unlike the one slice of cheese and pre-packaged lunch meat you get at Subway."}
{"text":"Terrible service / avg food.  My first visit: They gave my sandwich to the folks behind me and then the Mgr appeared PO'd when I didn't want to accept the low budget cold cuts they purchased. Then he rushed to make me a smaller/mediocre version of their signature Big Kahuna Cheesesteak I ordered and paid for (I presume he did this because he had to make it twice and was trying to make up for their loss). And all this took place while I watched about a half dozen folks that were behind me order, get their meals and leave.  Anyway, I'll never go to another Jersey Mike's again."}
{"text":"Proof that  a chain can be good.  What do you get when the sub shop prepares the beef in store and then GRILLS the steak?  The best steak sandwich you'll get in Charlotte.  Hey Subway - get rid of the microwaves.  Other places get rid of the steamer.  This is how subs should be made.  Also, the deli meats and cheeses are sliced fresh when you order.  The sandwiches are great, albeit a little smaller than Subway and sometimes a little pricier.  You get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"How does a sandwich shop run out of bread...  The best part is it was a Door Dash order and I didn't find out until waiting for an hour."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Jersey Mike's! If I had to pick between Subway, Jimmy John's or JM's, Jersey Mike's all the way.   Subs are HUGE. The giant is more than enough for 2-3 maybe even 4 adults. Great price too! I think between $8-$10 for a giant.  The buffalo chicken is my favorite, but the Italian is right there with it. Ingredients are always fresh, and displayed for you to see. I like to see my food being prepared and this is just the place to see it. Adding and subtracting items on your sub is never and issue, especially helpful for the picky eaters.  Pretty large menu for a smaller sandwhich shop, but not so big you can't decide quickly. Very fast and polite service. Language barrier has been frustrating at times, but we worked through it. Chips are offered as a side with your sub, or a cookie! All in all, JM's is a pretty awesome little sub shop and I would recommend it to anyone. Just saw they have an APP!!!! Online ordering ROCKS!!!"}
{"text":"I got a call from the owner based on my review and I must say i was very pleased with the way the owner handled the situation.  My daughter an i have always loved Jersey Mike's and make it a point to frequent this location. Everyone has a bad day and we must have walked in right when there's was happening but on the revisit everything was perfect, clean and rockin, the way it has always been!  The Subs were as always amazing and the service was fantastic. I am so happy they addressed the minor problems. On a positive note, i changed my rating and gave them 5 star! Class acts all the way! See you his week!"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the rage is about this place. When they first opened in Surprise a lot of people were talking about how excited they were because Jersey Mikes is so great. I would beg to differ. This place is nothing special and is extremely overpriced! We have no problem spending money on good food.....but this place is far from 'worth' the money. The subs are mediocre to low quality. The sizes of the subs are odd at 5,7 and 15. And the prices range from $5 to $15 for a sub. I'm sorry but $15 for a sub is ridiculous. Buy the time you get chips and a drink you are close to $20......ugh...ya right! We have seen many sub shops come and go in Surprise.....this is probably the third one in the exact space and none before have last so I'm sure Jersey Mikes will be taking a hike very soon. Overpriced mediocre food does not last in Surprise. I'd suggest you go down the road to Mr. Goodcents who has been a valley staple for sometime now. They have a 15 inch sub for the price of Jersey Mikes medium sized sub."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about Jersey Mike's, I drove by this location and decided to give it a try.   Was disappointed. The service was lacking. I walked in and was ignored while the employee finished watching a football play on the tv. Cool. He took my order and answered questions rather sluggishly.    Then another group walked in and his whole demeanor changed! I guess they are regular customers. He went on to talk to the woman about how his manager made him work a long shift because he was \"sick\" and continued to rant.   I was still standing awkwardly because I wasn't told I would pay after I received my sandwich.   Finally we were underwhelmed by the sand which itself. It was basic and definitely not worth the wait and the service."}
{"text":"I have to say Mike, Brandt, and Aaron are doing a FANTASTIC job! My wife has celiac and when she found out Jersey Mike's carries GF bread, she was elated. Now it is one thing to have a substandard GF option and no real concern for cross contamination. However Mike, Brandt and Aaron are pros. They scrubbed down the meat slicer, washed down the counters, washed their hands and changed their gloves. Plus ensured the knife that was used was not contaminated by the other sandwiches. Again, if you are looking for a solid GF option for sandwiches go see these guys!"}
{"text":"I really love the selection of subs here. The choices on the menu are different than what you typically find in a sub shop. There's definitely great hot and cold sandwiches here. My husband is a much bigger fan of this type of fast food and this is definitely his favorite sandwich shop. That being said, I really enjoy the food here. One thing I am impressed with is one of the employees is always an absolute delight. He has the best attitude and demeanor and makes going in for a bite here a treat.  I have never sat inside the shop as we usually get our food to go. There are also a few tables outside and I'd think this is the better option, if the weather isn't bad, than sitting in the little space that is this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place sucked, i ordered 3 subs and got 2 of them wrong. I asked for no mayo and they gave me a ton of mayo. They even made a completely different sub that i didn't even order. Disappointed ."}
{"text":"Great on any side of the state line.  Real Jersey subs...dripping with Italian dressing, quality cold cuts stacked on fresh wheat of white breads that are soft, warm and like a sweet hug.  Giant size is truly too much for one person, so bring a friend or order the regular.  Hot sandwiches include a very excellent Philly Cheese steak and the kahuna includes extra cheese and jalapenos.  Oh boy!  Treat yourself.  Excellent lunch or dinner and kids will love you for feeding them from Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"I love jersey miles but this is a new location!! And the service was sad. Out of wheat bread and didn't inform customers about the points membership. Not impressed with this location the girl working to be more friendly."}
{"text":"It's OK they aren't the best location but they are a new location. They were super busy so hopefully next time it's better"}
{"text":"My new favorite sub place! I really love \"Mike's Way\" on my sandwiches. The blend of red wine vinegar, olive oil, and oregano is delicious. The staff is really nice too! I have never had a bad experience, and I visit at least once a week."}
{"text":"Love love love Jersey Mikes! This place seriously blows Subway out of the water. Although Subway has more choices, this place has fresher food. They slice the meat and cheese right in front of you!"}
{"text":"Tonight I went to Jersey's Mike's to get a club sub with bacon and was told they didnt have bacon because someone messed up and didnt make any. UGH!!!!! So I settled for a #4 and the bread was hard as a rock...If I didnt get it to go then I would have returned it...I ended up tossing the bread and eating sandwhich meat for dinner. Probably will not be back....They need to have a manager regulating food availability and quality."}
{"text":"New location! What a wonderful friendly staff! Love there fresh rolls for the subs. I love that we can view all the fresh ingredients for subs"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time and ordered the pastrami sandwhich. To put it simply, it was delicious. I will definitely be visiting this place again. Hope the quality stays great."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for our first visit.  Wow is this place great.  We were met with a welcome as soon as  we stepped through the door.  We had the Reuben  and it was great.  We were impressed with the food and the service.  Being newbies we were given a free cookie!  The manager brought us some of their BBQ beef to try after our meal.  They roast the beef every day on site.  This place is great.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"So I was stationed at FT Dix NJ and I am by no means a subject matter expert on Cheese Steaks but I can honestly say this this place is un-fricken real. I usually eat at a restaurant a few times before writing anything because everyone has off days but everyone also hits first time home runs so I usually look for patterns and these guys have the consistency. Best sandwich?........ the Philly Cheese with chipotle sauce on it....  And I drop the mic and walk  Good job guys keep it up"}
{"text":"Should have went to subway! Rude staff didn't ask what I wanted with my sub. There was no juice for my children to drink and only knew this after I purchased two kids meal for 10$. I ask for some Gatorade and was denied stating there is no juice on the menu. Worst sub place. Horrible amount of beef on my 10$ sub. I was so upset I was shaking worst lunch I've had in years."}
{"text":"I consider Jersey Mike's one of the premium sub shops. They are on the higher end of the price scale but their quality is the reason for that. Their fixins and bread are always very fresh and they slice the meats & cheeses to order. The employees are always friendly and chatty. They have a loyalty card that lets you earn free sandwiches. They have a few TV's that always have the games on. Because of the pricing, I don't go here more than once a week because I can probably save $3 at Subway with a daily special. It is a treat that I usually reserve for the weekend but we look forward to it because we like their sandwiches. If I did not get the daily specials at Subway then this would be my workweek place too."}
{"text":"#9 on wheat is my favorite, too bad this location doesn't have sourdough. Friendly staff and my sandwich was great !"}
{"text":"This place was not clean, they took 35 mins to make my buffalo chicken wrap.  Employees were all over the place and rude.  After it took them 35 mins of saying they cooked my chicken it was still under cooked. The place is expensive and I wasted 10.00"}
{"text":"Two girls working tonight we're getting slammed with uber orders. Great teamwork and handle those of us walk ins  like we were the only thing they needed to do. Yes it is a sub above!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is our favorite sandwich place. So we were really excited when we found out there was one going in close to us. But unfortunately this location has been disappointing. They are SO SLOW! I went in tonight and there were only 2 people in front of me and I was still there for 20 mins. The guy making the sandwiches was definitely not in a hurry and had a bunch of sandwiches lined up to make. The other employees were just standing around at their stations Instead of helping him. Wouldn't it be more efficient if the person running the cash register jumped over to help the sandwich maker if there was no one at the register? Also, they didn't listen to what I actually wanted on my sandwich and had to make it again. Ugh. For now on I'll probably just drive to one of the other locations and save myself the headache."}
{"text":"I have visited this location twice in the past month.  I will be honest, I only buy the #13 because it is the closest to the taste of a sub from Jersey.  add the salt, pepper and oregano and I think I was back in Jersey eating at a sub shop there. The meat is freshly cut, the bread (you don't get choices back in Jersey at a sub shop so wheat or white was fine by me) was nice and crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. The employees were very nice both times, same crew.  In fact they remembered who I was from a few weeks back and held a great conversation with me.  In fact they were just as friendly to another repeat consumer who came in after me.  Overall, the staff was very courteous and the sub was great. i will be back for more."}
{"text":"I enjoy Jersey Mike's my family eats  here maybe 3 days out the week. However the last couple times I have been  there in the evenings it's only been  2 people working and it's pretty busy. Please fix that this, other then this great place"}
{"text":"Today I attempted to call in a catering order during the lunch rush hour.  The young man taking my order forgot it's against their process to take large orders over the phone during lunch, so in the middle of our conversation I could hear a woman yelling at him stating that he couldn't take the order because it was lunch time. For her to yell that while a customer is listening was unprofessional.  She should have told him to put the phone on hold so I was not able to hear her attitude.  We hung up and I go the location to place my order in line. I got in the line and asked to speak to the manager. When she came up front I asked if I could speak to her in private and she looks at me and says, \"I'm working\" as if she couldn't take a couple of minutes so speak with me.  I told her I didn't want to say what I wanted to in front of all the customers waiting in line so she reluctantly walked me to a doorway. I stated to her I heard conversation she was having with her employee while I was on the phone trying to place an order and I thought it was unprofessional to hear her speak the way she did while a customer was on the phone. I also let her know I had no problem coming in to place my order if that was their process.  I run and own multiple businesses so I am extremely hesitant to post negative reviews online because I know people abuse a forum like this for all the wrong reasons, but the owner had no regard to my feelings or anything I had to say.  One I am not too busy to speak to any of my customers when they ask for me even at my busiest time of the day. I am also not above apologizing when a customer is upset.  I will not patronize this place again.  She never apologized for any of her actions. Mrs. Ross needs to get a better attitude and know how to treat people even when she's under her lunch rush pressure."}
{"text":"mehh........sandwich wasnt horrible but they could be using better quality lunch meat it tasted like prepackaged lunch meat from the supermarket"}
{"text":"I recently visited this Jersey Mike's location when I was in Charlotte on a business trip.  It is located across the parking lot from the Hyatt Place where I was staying.  This store had recently opened and was very clean and well kept. This was my first experience with a Jersey Mike's.  I was very impressed.  It reminds me a lot of Quizno's.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  The food was prepared quickly and it tasted great.  If I ever stay in this area again, I'm sure I'll stop in for a bite."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's Subs are one those few sandwich places that I don't mind going to every so often. One of the main reasons why is that they only had 3 locations in the Vegas area. With this being the fourth one that just opened up only makes the percentages of me having a JM sandwich even higher.  This day I had a regular size \"Big Kahuna\" on wheat bread. It's a Philly Cheesesteak with Onions, Mushrooms, Peppers, and Jalapenos. It tasted how a Philly should taste like. The only thing I that kind of bothered me was that I wanted it with extra onions but when I got my sandwich, there was hardly any at all. Since I had time constraints for lunch and there was a long line, I just let it go. Hopefully next time they get it right.  Their cold sandwiches are also very good. If you are not sure what to get, I recommend the #9 Club Supreme. It has Roast Beef, Turkey, Swiss, Bacon, Mayo, and topped off with Mike's Way. What is Mike's Way you ask? Well on all the cold subs, if you want all the fixins' you say what cold sandwich you want and say you want it Mike's Way which is Onions, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Spices, and \"The Juice\" (red wine vinegar and olive oil blend).  Their location is one of many eating establishments all clustered together in front of the South Premium Outlet Shopping Mall and right next to Las Vegas Blvd on the east side.  Service is efficient for they have an assembly line style of sandwich making. I notice they have one person constantly making sure all the tables are nice and clean.  The only negatives that I can say are that the parking is limited especially during lunch and dinner rushes. They said they have free WiFi but is not set up yet. You think that would be ready when they first opened.   Overall, I will definitely eat here as one of my many rotations in this area."}
{"text":"I went to our newly opened Jersey Mike's last night. I was hot. I was hungry. Hubby was traveling for work. The crew was awesome. All very friendly and eager to assist me. My subs could be served in a roll, a wrap or as a salad for those who are cutting carbs. I ordered a Philly cheese steak and Philly chicken. I requested to have the peppers and onions diced small and to add some lettuce and mayo inside the wheat wrap. I was offered a drink while I waited and happliy accepted it. My subs were full of meat, prepared as requested, hot and oh so yummy. Look at the picture!!! I couldn't stop eating until they were both in my stomach. Yes, I overindulged but I was full and happy the rest of the evening. I would have given 5  but the dining room needed a little cleaning up. I shall return and you should go. Thanks Jersey Mike's on Lake Pleasant Pkwy."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's makes a pretty decent sandwich. Fresh bread, more meat than that other chain where Jared eats, and a whole salad's worth of veges on top. Great flavor to everything. I like the number 13 Italian. Decent cheesesteaks too. However, the prices are a bit steep for a chain.  This location is clean; and it's generally staffed with friendly people. TVs in the corners if you're trying to watch a game while eating your sandwich...but with the hard seats and lack of beer, I don't really see the point.  Overall, this is a solid choice for a sandwich in Ahwatukee. I just happen to know some other very solid choices too, so it's not my usual spot."}
{"text":"I visited this location on a Monday night about 20 minutes before closing. There was no line and there was one guy who was about to check out. After the employee helped the customer he went back to cutting meat and didn't say a word to me or do anything to acknowledge that I was there. I waited for about 7 minutes as the employee kept about. Then an older gentleman walked in and stood in line next to me. At that point the employee called over to another employee to help customers. The second employee came out and didn't say a word but started putting on his gloves. By this time I had waited for 10 minutes. I know it doesn't take 10 minutes to make sandwich when the store is not even busy. I wish I had better things to say about this location. But bad customer service is what lead me to this Yelp review. Don't come to this location unless you have time to spare and don't mind poor service."}
{"text":"I wanna give a shout out to the crew that worked on Sunday afternoon! Even though they were busy, the customer service was great, and they got the orders out in a timely manner.The Sandwich was fresh and great. I definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Positives: Only good thing was the time it took to get our order completed. We were in and out in 15 minutes with our takeout order.  I guess I should say they are fairly generous with their meats.   Negatives: Condescending customer service, 5 guys behind the counter and not one was friendly.  The huge pink bricks of processed ham should not be the first thing you see when you get to the counter.  Ordered the #13 Italian sub, bread was dry, and cheese was tasteless, not a great combo.  What kind of sub shop does not offer Italian dressing for an Italian sub?    I'll pass on this place, and head to firehouse from now on."}
{"text":"My wife and I showed up within 30minutes of closing and were happily greeted and we ate there with no stink eyes or uncomfortable looks. Kyle and Shonnique gave us AMAZING customer service and don't get me started on our sandwiches. We always loved getting sandwiches from this location but WOW. This time our sandwiches were TOP NOTCH. They really raised the bar on Jersey Mikes product and customer service. Favorite experience at any Jersey Mikes and by far the best sandwich ever had at any Jersey Mikes. All around great experience. Full stomach and big smiles. THANK YOU GUYS!"}
{"text":"First time at this location and I'm super impressed because the service was quick and friendly. I got my usual Turkey and provolone with extra avocado and it's extra yummy today :) Definitely coming back to this one if I'm in the area :)"}
{"text":"Keeping it simple.  They have great subs.  Every employee there while I was there was kind. By he restaurant appeared extremely clean."}
{"text":"As this was my first visit here, it unfortunately started off with abrasive and lackluster service upon my visit in the afternoon on 6-1-17. No one was friendly, explanatory, or even very communicative. I ordered my item and stood by the toppings to customize my order (as I had watched another customer ahead of me do). To my surprise, they finished my order before I was able to communicate what toppings I wanted.  When I apologized and told the lady I wanted to add some things to my item, she rudely told me something along the lines of \"The first thing you should do is tell us what you want in your sub.\" her delivery was not only embarrassing,  but it made me feel genuinely bad.    The second and last straw was when I asked if I'm able to split the cost on behalf of me using two methods of payment. I was told that they couldn't unless I wanted to pay extra, in essence. I have worked at restaurants in the past and used a variety of different POS systems, all of which had a method of separating payment. Perhaps this business does not split payment; however, I can't help but suspect I was just being given a hard time.   Food was good,  but the service members left an extremely bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Number 13 on white is where it's at! The 11 is also a good option. In my opinion Jersey Mikes has the best cold subs in town. The bread, meat, and ingredients are all top notch. The 99 is probably the best hot sub on the menu."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Jersey Mike's until I moved to Las Vegas and I don't know if I'll ever go back to Subway!   All their meat is sliced fresh when you order it and their chicken breast is grilled to order (not some spongy chicken patty that Subway has). I also like that they have wraps and that you can make any sub sandwich into a salad.  Cons: Not as many veggie toppings as Subway, and not as many bread choices either.  Overall, I like the quality of their meat and how everything was just super fresh. This will be my new go-to sandwich place for sure!"}
{"text":"Favorite jerseys mikes in vegas great good and service as usual thanks always busy but fast service and clean store"}
{"text":"My favorite item is #13 on white bread, mikes way, mayo, pickles and skipping the red wine vinegar. Every bite is delicious. *drools* The taste of the food, price and restaurant is five stars. However, overall I give this location a four star, customer service needs work, parking space is limited since business are within this location and getting out of this plaza is a nightmare during the weekdays (12PM-6PM)."}
{"text":"I love this sandwich shop I stopped going to all other sandwich shops . This is my place"}
{"text":"Jersey mikes is normally my fav sub place but this location was terrible! They don't toast the buns so my sandwich was soggy and they pretty much no sauce on it. It was so bad I asked for my money back after a few bites which was also unsuccessful. Waste of time and money:/"}
{"text":"They have the best Italian sub...for a chain at least. I like to get it on rosemary bread and add the cherry pepper relish. I try to bring lunch to work most days but Tuesdays are Jersey Mike's.  $6 for a regular size sub, chips, and a drink.  Regular italian is usually $8. If not Tuesday I get a mini and don't even finish it, so Tuesdays are a good value."}
{"text":"Very expensive for a sub.....not bad food but getting them to put extra lettuce was like pulling teeth."}
{"text":"I have been to Jersey Mikes about 6 times before at the Chandler blvd location and the service has always been good. Today I came into the chandler location and I was amazed by the team work of two gentleman! I was there at about 7:30pm and a blond fella and a curly brown hair guy were just great hosts and even spent time to crack some jokes with me without missing a bit of their work. I 10/10 recommend this location!!!"}
{"text":"Ok roast beef sub, had Mike's way. My only complaint was I was so hurried to decide and pushed down the line from the time I entered the door, that I didn't have time to really look at what might be good that I hadn't had before. I left with having an ok sub, which I wish I'd had more say in."}
{"text":"Way back when I was in the USN and stationed in Newport R.I. I used to get these really fabulous subs (they called them grinders).  Those grinders are the standard by which all sandwiches have been measured since.  I've been searching for a decent sub shop in this area; however all there seems to be are the ubiquitous (and sub-standard) Subways and similar blah spots.  Since nothing beats old memories, I'm only giving Mike's four stars, but really this place is hard to beat!  There's another chain I like as well, but it's too far to go just to get a sandwich.  I got a super sub and my daughter got an Italian.  both came with a generous portion of very fresh meat and we both got them dressed \"Mike's Way\" with added jalapenos.  We both were very happy and in addition, the service is quick and very friendly. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!!!   I asked for Tue special the cashier said OK.  Then told me the price 2 times.  Now they only do special until 4. He never said that just kept saying the price until I asked why so much.  He just stared at me. I said never mind I don't want it.  I walked out no o e said anything. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The meat was so thin it only had one side and the sandwich was mostly lettuce and bread. At $14 for a giant i'll go around the corner sprouts and get 2  $3 sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love jersey mikes but HATE this location I live closer to the one on 51st Avenue but was in the area so my boyfriend and I stopped to get a couple subs, we got there at 9:15 they close at 10 and as soon as we walked up to the register the guy told us they have no bread. I told him that is fine and I was going to get one of their sub in the tubs but the associate had walked away and we stayed there for about 5 minutes and nobody even spoke to us after that, we walked next door to Smashburger and sat on the patio and continued to watch customers walk in and out of Jersey Mike's until we left, definitely worth going to the one on 51st Avenue."}
{"text":"If you want a Philly cheesesteak - this is the place to go. No where in the surrounding area will you get closer to the real thing. Only reason for four stars instead of five is the roll is not 100% what you would get in the Philadelphia area. The service was fast and friendly and the cheesesteak was delicious. They put onions and peppers on their steak- which I did not have as the onion/pepper is not on a typical philly steak in philly ... so can't comment on those but they have the steak and cheese down pat! Great place to go for a cheesesteak"}
{"text":"I always forget about Jersey Mikes in uptown because it's not in the over street mall area. This location is found in the Citizen bank building. It's super busy on Tuesdays because they run their $6.59 lunch special (regular sub, chips & drink), but the service has always been super fast.   My go to choice the the #7- turkey and cheese all the way with banana peppers added. Wondering what 'all the way' means? Well it's lettuce, onion, tomato, pepper, salt, oil,vinegar and special seasoning. It tastes awesome. They also have a bunch of different sandwiches to pick from.   Additionally, Jersey Mike's doesn't skimp on the toppings. Every time I've been here they load up the meat. There's a good amount on your sub so you won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place for philly cheesesteaks, but they do a great job making me happy here. Fortunately I had a bad experience at ono's next door today that made me cancel my order and walked right into Jersey Mike's....  DA BOMB!"}
{"text":"I was forced to go there at gun point. Well not exactly but my wife of 43 years wanted to go.  There were 3 young women working there. I won't say they weren't nice, but they weren't particularly friendly. If you've never been to Jersey Mike's before, study before hand on the net. They were annoyed by questions.  Everything was fresh but just a blah sandwich with no real reason to go there except to stuff your face.  My advice is go West about 3/4 of a mile and get a sandwich at Publix. There it's a better price as well as a huge selection of meats and cheese. They'll cut anything from the deli department with a smile. BTW we checked out an Italian Pizzeria and Restaurant next door that looks pretty good. The owner's name is Mike. We're going to try it and I'll let you know.  Remember Publix!"}
{"text":"What can I say except that I like my meat hot.  Ok, at least my sandwich meat should be toasty.    My office gets sandwiches a couple of times a week and Jersey Mike's is so much better than Subway and Jimmy Johns.  Better tasting bread, higher quality ingredients, and you get more than a paltry slice of meat.    This location in particular is efficient, the staff well-trained, and will definitely make it a regular in the rotation."}
{"text":"They're still a little shaky here after opening about a year ago. They're in a tough location for getting high quality employees. Their current staff was friendly and professional during my recent visit, but the service was slower than I've experienced at other Jersey Mike's locations. I'd give everyone a break for being new, and encourage them to get more comfortable with their jobs. And I'll offer some advice. If you're in HS or college, and this is your only work experience, don't treat it lightly. ROCK IT! There are many people like me that want to recruit for potential from retail spots. But you have to have your A game on every day. You never know what opportunities might be out there with your current employer, or your next one!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for a year or so. Literally a staple for me 3-4 days a week. Now after moving to Safford I literally dream of this place. Fresh meats, fresh cheeses, fresh bread, how can you go wrong? The employees here are phenomenal. Every time I am back in the valley I will be here."}
{"text":"This place rocks. We come here quite often as it is just down the road from my office. Killer subs, awesome cookies, nothing but good stuff here!"}
{"text":"I chose to try Jersey Mike's because ain't nothin' better than a good sandwich. It was on my way and not crowded at all: A+. I got the Super Sub (provolone, ham, prosciuttini and cappacuolo) on white and a small drink. It was just under $9. My first thought was this looks like a glorified Blimpie. They slice the rectangular loaves of meat to order and make the sandwich in front of you. The topping selection is okay. They had jalapenos so I was set. Upon trying my super sub, I was not impressed. Actually, my sandwich tasted just like a Blimpie Best. Half of it went into the garbage and I sincerely regretting not ordering the mini sub size. This place is not quite comparable to Subway, maybe a step above? The fountain Pepsi burned my throat and was AWESOME. Highlight of my meal. Based on my sub-par sandwich experience, I don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Yum, Jersey Mike's! I freakin' love their wheat bread with the little specks of... I don't know what it is but it's very good. The mini sandwich looks tiny when you first see only the bread but after it's decked out and rolled up, it becomes a plentiful sized sandwich. I've tried different sandwiches here... turkey, club (both kinds), italian and cheesesteak and love them all. There's something about that oil and vinegar they top it off with in the end that seals the deal. Other places do that too, but Idk here it just tastes better.  Sometimes I ask for the chipotle mayo instead of the regular and it's quite yummy with a little added spice.   Also, I like that they carry Pepsi products. I like it better than Coke. And they have Cherry Pepsi, too  :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to jersey mikes for years and it does not matter which location I'm at I always get the best subs with great service. I been coming to this location ever since they opened and I love it. I have not been to a subway or jimmy johns in years because they pail in comparison. I typically get the chipotle cheesesteak and I find it better than most sit down restaurant. My wife always gets the club supreme mikes way and that's great too. I will be back as always at least a few times a month. Keep it up!!!!"}
{"text":"This location was average. They don't have sourdough bread so I was disappointed from the start. The lettuce and onions looked dated not fresh. Tables were all dirty. Definitely wont be returning. I'm giving it an extra star because at least the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"After years of driving past this sub shop I finally decided to grab my wife and I subs for lunch from here. The MAIN reason I can only give three stars is for almost $15 I got two of there medium subs with nothing on it to make it that expensive. We both got #9 which came with turkey and roast beef and bacon. The roast beef was nice and rare. You have the option to add mayo onion lettuce tomatoes banana peppers and pickles. The sandwich did not taste bad but we feel you do not get your monies worth at this establishment.One of the good things I noticed though is they cut your cheese and meats to order so the freshness is good here. Save your self the money and go to another sub place. You get more food for you buck at subway or Alesci's of Shoregate. Younger kids working around lunch time. Friendly and people seem to like jersey mikes  and the dining area was full around 1pm. (No photo of our subs)"}
{"text":"There are better options.  I've eaten a a number of Jersey Mike's over the years including this one.  Unfortunately I did not like it four years ago and when I tried it again today, found little improvement.  Store is a bit worn and needs painting and an upgrade. Staff seems to be going through the motions although there was at least one individual who seemed to really care.  The #5 I had was OK and the Wheat Bread is what made it.  The meat had little character and the tomatoes had no taste but were very bland and believe it or not, so were the Jalepenos.  I expected the OIl and Vinegar dressing to kick it up a bit and give a bit of a tart counterpoint, but you could not even taste the vinegar.  Bit pricier that Subay and not as good a product.  That said, the Jersey Mike's in Mooresville off of Brawley School Road is the exact opposite.  The sandwich I got there a couple of weeks back was excellent."}
{"text":"Always great subs, but this review is about how incredibly clean it was and how nice the employees were. 5 stars 100%"}
{"text":"Not only will they fuck your order up and not give you items you ordered... but they will have some lame ass excuse of we were slammed and sorry nothing I can do for you. Fuck the district manager David whatever"}
{"text":"We went in tonight. The customer service was horrible. One of the workers was very rude and disrespectful. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Yummy favorite plaza of a sub in Vegas! It's just the best! I always get ham and Provolone, just wish the bread was softer!"}
{"text":"I have say that I much rather prefer the flamingo & 215 location! This location just seemed a little all over the place, but the biggest disappointment was the food! We ordered a tuna wrap & tuna sub, the tuna was disgustingly wet, to the point it made our food super soggy,  so I had to toss my other half! It kept sliding off the bread, then mind you, there were huge chunks of celery inside, whoever made it just didn't care and didn't take the time to dice the celery properly! The tuna at the other location is way better, I do not thing I would order tuna at this location again!"}
{"text":"okaaaay...!  freaking yumm!  skeptical...just cuz i am... and i'm not a big sub person... too much bread in a carb addicted world w a 5ft bod... took me almost 2 months to check this place out... took awesome advice...order the \"#9 mike way\"  they cook their roast beef on the premises daily.. i'm a sucker for a good roast beef... won't eat if not worthy... sooooo good!  ate the whole frickin thing... my friend got the philly cheese steak w jalepeno...darn tasty.....and a peanut butter cookie that i wished would never end.,.  top that off w yummo iced and great service w an affordable price(don't know where other peeps think too high.... for what you get, i'm down w it!)  only problem....  i need to go back daily to sample whole menu....and i'm already craving another #9 mikes way...see my prob? def b back sooner than not!"}
{"text":"Dejah was a very friendly employee and an excellent sandwich maker. The restaurant was very clean and nice staff. Will come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Three sizes for your sub rather than 6 inch or foot long.  Much better than that other sub place.  Pleasant service was added plus.  Rec'd a free cookie when I mentioned it was my first time here."}
{"text":"Well here's the dilemma food is good staff was trying to manage work load nevertheless there wasn't enough bodies. This is a staffing issue no reason to lose buisness hire more ppl and staff accordingly. I have been to most valley locations this is my home shop sooo sad."}
{"text":"I'm usually impressed with the service at Jersey Mikes, however this is my first time visiting during the busy lunch hour. I don't know if it's standard for only one employee to work at a time while the other 3 watch but it took me 20 minutes to get my sub. To top it off when one of the professional sandwich artists gave my sub to the person in front of me they were very rude about making me another one and I had to twice remind him that I was still waiting for my sandwich to be remade. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"I can't say it's the best sub sandwich I've ever had, but it was good.  My little cutie pie and I met my hubby here for lunch.  Hubby had the sliced to order #6 Roast Beef Special he really liked.  It was huge with all the veggies, oil and vinegar.  I had the #17 Philly Cheesesteak, not bad.  I've learned my lesson not to order a kid's meal just because often times lesser quality meat is substituted.  Maybe not here, but I didn't want to take a chance.  He got the mini turkey with provolone, a good size for a mini.  He had to eat the other half later on in the afternoon.  They get really busy here, so go before noon, if you want a table!"}
{"text":"I was so elated to hear that this shop reopen again. Came in today great service Monica and Shay were just excellent with people, they were fast and were attentive on customers needs. They smiled all the time. We will always come back here. We love their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Some friends and I had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon around 12. My first impression, based on the line almost out the door, was \"Wow, this place must be good\". It took us about 15 minutes to get through the line, too long of a wait for me for a sub. However, the food was good, not great, but good. I got the Original Italian \"Mike's Way\". The sandwich makers had a hard time keeping the toppings on my sandwich, resulting in a messy lunch. The subs are more expensive here too, so just be prepared to spend twice as much as you would at a subway. I would go back again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for another meal here."}
{"text":"My family and I had an OUTSTANDING experience at Jersey Mike's. The staffs were beyond A+!! My 19yr Daughter who is pregnant became ill (NOT FROM THE FOOD) but from her issues she's been having. The staff did everything they could to help out and making sure she was okay. They even stayed late to ensure she was okay to leave with us. We have NEVER had such caring staff restaurant before. Now about our subs WOW they were so good blows Subway, Blimpie and the other so called fresh sub places."}
{"text":"Went to order my usual  sandwich which I clearly ordered 9 mike way the girl standing next to the girl who took order right away asked me again what my order was after telling her again I said I don't like repeating my order.The girl right away got a attitude and walked away from me .Luck would have it my coupon code would not go in the other girl came back and told the expiration was out. The other girl pointed out the date was good.Very poor service I will not return and will be reporting to the main office SAD"}
{"text":"I have been going to Jersey Mikes for quite some time for a #13 or a Tuna. I decided to switch it up a bit the last two times.  I ordered the Steak and Cheese with just pickles.  Well the first time there was a tiny bit of Steak so I figured it was just the person cooking it.  Well the second time it was even less.  Very disappointing.  Sub corral down the street beats them on the steak and cheese by far."}
{"text":"Upon entering, the guys here were beyond \"chipper\" and ready to work! My friend and I ordered several sandwiches and cookies. We were asked what toppings we wanted to eat sandwhich, what type of bread, and even given suggestions on how others like their sandwiches made. To see the meat being cut right on the counter reminded me of real old school, authentic sandwich shops...and that was pretty darn cool!   For all the sandwiches and cookies we ordered, the guys got them made quickly and my friend and I were out in no time. Kudos to those young guys for having pride in their jobs."}
{"text":"This is a chain - if you want to know about the chain read other reviews.  Secret things you can order: (not at all secret) 1) Mayonnaise on both sides of your sub.  You will catch some of the employees doing this for their own subs, it adds calories but I love the mayo here so it is time to cheat on your diet; 2) on the side.  Get everything wet on the side.  Jersey Mike's runs sloppy wet for those of us who like the works.  You can ask for your oil, vinegar, sport peppers, banana peppers, and any other sauces on the side.  You will get plenty for your sub and you can smear or dip them as needed to keep your sub from being a wet mess. 3) hot colds.  You can ask that they heat up some of your meats, they don't always do this but if you want your turkey hot they can heat it up the same as they make the big kahuna.  What I don't like is that if you don't get things on the side these subs tend to run wet.  I wish they could salad spin the pickles and lettuce before they put them on the sub.  I don't like the mayonnaise and melange of whatever else is on my sub running down to my wrist because of all the water, brine, vinegar, etc. that peculates through the sandwich.  I have never had an improperly made sub from this location - that is something you can rely on."}
{"text":"7 pm on sunday  they are open until 9.  grill is closed because the employees want to leave"}
{"text":"When someone orders a veggie sub you may want to consider that they don't want meat. Placing my formerly vegetarian sub directly in between two roast beef subs, in total contact with meat on both sides is disgusting and rude. Which is why I walked out. Jersey mikes has been permanently ruined in my mind."}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches here but please teach your employees to pay attention. I don't like repeating my order more than twice for fuck sakes... And it's still wrong... And even though I see at least 4 red shirts, more employees than customers, I still have to clean my own freaking table... I think Jersey Mikes has a serious management issue as it seems the condition is the same at other locations... 3 stars for tasty sammiches... Minus 2 for lackluster service and cleanliness.."}
{"text":"Ordered online an hour before they closed and they canceled it twice and didn't answer the phone. They just wanted to close early on a Friday. Bad business"}
{"text":"I actually went to the Jersey MIke's on West Chandler Boulevard - but the review is general for the chain.  I second the many other reviewers that this sandwich shop is way to expensive for what it provides (approx $1 more expensive then other general sub chains). The toppings are limited, the meat is nothing fancy to make it more expensive, there is only two choices of bread and there is no toasted option. For as much as I paid for my 5 inch sub - I could have ventured over to the nearby souper salad and recieved a more comprehensive meal"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Jersey Mikes since I stumbled upon one in Michigan. I love how the owners at this location are so personable and friendly. They take interest in you and put care into making your order. The food is always fresh and the establishment is clean. My favorite sub shop! I had the Philly cheesesteak today and it was delicious. The bread was fresh and it was nice and hot. I also like how the subs are wrapped in foil so they stay hot until you get to your destination. The cookies are also pretty tasty too!"}
{"text":"My fave place for a sub sandwich. The meat is sliced right in front of you.  All the boasting Subway does about \"Eat Fresh\" , they should take a page from Jersey Mikes book."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, friendly service, low price.  This location is always busy but you're still in and out in less than five minutes."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out the subs and they have won us over! Subway is trash compared to the higher quality ingredients, from the bread to meat. This is a very welcome addition to the Laveen area, food choices in the area are horrid, but this bring I some wonderful light!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch on Thursday. Kept seeing the ads on tv and had never been. I have had cheese steaks back east in Philly lots of times so I know what a good cheese steak is like. This is an ok cheesesteak. The bun is the biggest difference.  In Philly the use a crusty on the outside friend roll. Here the news is soft thru out. The meat seems of good quality and it tasted almost like what most places back east serve. I missed the crunch of the bread on this one. iPad the chipotle cheese steak with extra cheese. They use provolone which is how I like mine. No whizz for me. :)  Over all it was very fast with excellent service. The steak was good, just not what I am used to. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We were in town with friends, having a grand time.  Driving down the street to a show, we were a little behind schedule but had the munchies.  My buddy suggests Jersey Mike's.    Good choice.  Our friends had been there before but we'd never heard of Jersey Mike's.  So we knew nothing going in - what they serve, what the prices are, what the options are, etc.  Annnnddd....we were in a hurry.  Those people there took good care of us.  They were patient while we stared all over the interior like goofs, trying to figure out what to get and why.   They made suggestions and streamlined the process so we could get back on the road.  Back on the road, those sandwiches were delicious!!!  Reasonable pricing for everything we got (sandwiches, cookies, chips, drinks), polite interactive employees, and great taste.  Go Jersey Mike's!!!!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Quick and easy lunch spot that always tastes fresh and gets you out the door fast! They have three sizes (I prefer the medium) and three different types of bread to choose from. I love how they cut the meat right in front of you so you know it hasn't been sitting out for hours! The staff is very friendly and restaurant is well maintained. I'd recommend you getting it \"Mikes\" way the first visit and alter the toppings to your liking on the next go around. Although I love the simplicity of the menu, I do wish they had more veggie variety. Also, a different side other than chips would be good i.e. fruit, potato or macaroni salad, etc."}
{"text":"Where's my sandwich?  I waited in line with 30 other people, when I got to the counter, I asked for a philly, paid, and waited.  The cooks changed shifts, the first cook started cleaning the flattop and left.  the second cook continued cleaning.  then he looked at his tickets, which was only 1 and threw it away.  that was my ticket.  after 15 mins and seeing the customers after me being served philly's, I asked where was my sandwhich.  The cashier asked the cook if he got my ticket.  the cook said no and they looked at me saying they already served me.  I showed them my receipt and repeated i didn't get my sandwhich, I saw the cook throw my ticket in the trash.  They looked at me and didn't provide me any solutions.  After hearing my plane was about to depart, I asked for a refund.  They asked for me to stand aside while other customers were being help.  I again asked for a refund....  no sandwhich, poor service, late to my plane and stressed over a refund.  Jersey Mike, please pursue more training and weed out the bad service!!"}
{"text":"They offer Gluten-free bread!  They cleaned the slicer and changed gloves for me when I ordered GF sub, which I appreciated. Although the cleaning of the slicer takes a couple minutes.   Good service and tasty subs, so I recommend this place for a quick bite during the work day."}
{"text":"First time at a jersey mikes and I'm pretty impressed at how quickly I was in and out of the store with multiple orders. I ordered the club sandwich and it was very good. The customer service was great. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area again. Unfortunately there isn't one by where I live."}
{"text":"Sandwich was good. Service was awesome. The young ladies that served us were happy and joked around with us. This is a good place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"This location always makes a great cheesesteak. Let me just say I've had at least five cheesesteaks from this location."}
{"text":"We had the sub club sandwich.  Their was a good portion of turkey and ham, bacon strips were REAL bacon!  Vegetables were fresh, wheat bread was good.  All of the servers were friendly.  We will visit again."}
{"text":"Okay sandwich place.  Better than a Subway.  Similar to a Quiznos."}
{"text":"Seriously soo good. They make your sandwich huge and use really fresh ingredients. So much better than Subway or Jimmy Johns!! Get the sweet peppers on top!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times and started going because I knew someone in one of my classes recommended it to me. Food was good, although they put way too much oil and vinegar on your sandwich. Even if you only ask for a little! The last couple experiences have been ruined by the staff. The (I'm guessing high school age) boys that work there are extremely rude. I asked for a sandwich that a former employee used to make for me but I forgot his name for a second. I guessed and said his name might have been Jose (it was Angelo, way off). However, instead of politely correcting me the kid replied \" Are you talking about Angelo? You were way off! JOSE!?\" Then proceeded to laugh and call me racist.... It was a simple mistake and I did not appreciate being laughed at and called racist especially in an establishment where the workers should be polite and know better... The food is good, too bad I won't be back after that experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sub places. Reminds me of home on the East Coast. Highley recommend. Staff is always friendly and gets the order right the first time."}
{"text":"We're regulars at this Jersey Mike's - friendly staff and great sandwiches!  And, the exterior improvements are looking good."}
{"text":"I  went in on  Sat , May 5th in the late afternoon. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. The young ladies made a delicious sandwich and  this location is very close to my home.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Jersey Mike's for a couple years now my favorite is there a roast beef and provolone.  Yesterday the carelessness of the staff has made me decided that I'm not using this place anymore. When asked for the bread choice I asked for the new rosemary bread. At first she said she didn't have any which would've been fine.  Instead she went in the back and grab the roll that was stale and made my sandwich with it. Into whether a take-out order I didn't realize how bad it was till I got home needless to say that's not the way to keep customers.A simple \"no\" would've worked much better"}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes is pretty standard. Nothing wrong with the quality of my sandwiches. Only complaint is that both employees were in the back when I entered, so I had to holler for them to come out, and when they did, while friendly, the service overall was slow. At 7pm, they had a hearty line 3-4 people deep, and both of them were working on my order for two sandwiches. I wonder when the people in line behind me got out...."}
{"text":"Jersey mikes is my favorite sandwich shop by far. But this location has to be one of the worst ones in Vegas. To start the people there just seemed miserable like we were inconveniencing them by coming in 40 minutes before they closed. The girl that made our subs was super rude. When I asked for the new parm bread she rolled her eyes and said \"nope don't got it\" (like ok no big deal no need to be rude) Then when she's making our subs and I say mikes way she just proceeds to make the subs and I notice that there is no onions and thought maybe she would get them from the back or something and when she goes to finish I say \"is there no onions?\" And she once again rolls her eyes and says \"nope and I'm not about to slice anymore when we close soon\".. now when I was about 15-18 years old I worked at the Jersey Mikes in Boca Park. And that would have just been unacceptable I'm paying $50 for 4 sandwiches but again whatever. When I go to ring out she just holds out her hand for the money and is done. I will never be returning to this location and I'll definitely never recommend it to anyone. The food is good of course, I've had them made better but the service was trash."}
{"text":"I brought home some really good cheese steaks from this location. I've tried the other location at happy valley, but somehow it tasted better this time."}
{"text":"My first encounter with Jersey Mikes was in San Diego (Pacific Beach) after a surf trip, my local friends invited me to try this place and  It was love at first bite! Sadly I moved back to Henderson and No jersey Mikes anywhere close. But, when I found out they opened on Stephanie I was there! I am so happy.... best subs ever.Everything was fresh and tasty especially the bread because we all know at some Sub places the bread gets soggy and falls apart before you hit the door. My choice always is the original Italian. Their staff is friendly and very helpful. I suggest trying Jersey Mikes at least once, you will not be disappointed. ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in again on 3/27/18. Much better, clean, fast. Music turned down. Staff working, tall blond guy in charge was great.  Oh- But Sub is Always Great. No problems there. Sub Best in World. Treated our  friends since Mikes is Donating Today. Great community PR."}
{"text":"Have been to many Jersey Mike's and have been waiting for this one to open. Brand New. BUT. They need more supervision. For New- we stopped at 3pm on Saturday afternoon. Place and ALL tables were dirty. Floor needed sweep. Of course Mikes Sub was good ( maybe too much oil)   I like Pepsi over Coke products. Staff was friendly and fast. Location is pain to get to. One of those where parking lot is a maze. Just needs someone to make the boys clean up.  The J. M. On Gilbert and 202 have their act together and are excellent"}
{"text":"My husband and I just ordered Jersey Mike's today, and when we got home to enjoy our meal. we came across human blonde hair in our food!  he noticed the strand of hair in his sandwich and I offered him the rest of mine. He refused and I continued eating. Not only did he get hair in his food, but I also came across one in mine. I was quite disgusted it was embedded in the cheese. Will not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's has long been a favorite place to get subs. I like how the meat is sliced when you order it, and the bread is always yummy. The 3 stars has actually nothing to do with the food today, it has to do with the service. There were 6 people working and a long line. When I got,closer I saw the reason why the line was so long was because the staff was working on 2 gigantic online orders. Which is fine, but from a line and in person perspective it appeared like we were all not as important and not told there was a wait. It seems like during busy lunch rush you need to have a staff that only handles to go orders to better balance out the service levels. To get 1 sub of ham and cheese shouldn't take 15 min. By the time I got to put veggies on the staff working looked sp stressed out. My sandwich was only ok today. Think the concentration was in the bigger orders. I,paid 9 today with no drink amd I am not even sure why."}
{"text":"Worst Italian sub I ever had.3 peices of meat 2 small peices of cheese. What a ripoff.never again."}
{"text":"Came just now right after opening, and it was like the experience I was expecting from the first time we were here. The guys were friendly and took the time to make sure they were making the right sandwiches. The kid at the register even did what he was supposed to be by trying to up sell cookies, and holding a conversation while the other one was cooking.  He was new so when he didn't know what to do, he did well at asking the other guy and MOD for the right way.  This visit is how it should always be!  I know the sandwiches are going to be good and the restaurant was nice and clean.          Last time I came the guy was great. Got here tonight and they don't close or another half an hour and am told that we can't get half the sandwiches (hot or chicken) because they had already turned off their grill and looks like they have everything pretty much shut down...wonder if the general manager or owner knows this happens"}
{"text":"I love people that write reviews and talk about how over priced something is. If you want Subway this place is not for you. The best part about this location is that they truly get to know their customers. I have been going here for a while and they remember names and personal things about their customers. I'm impressed by their service and I enjoy the Turkey done Mikes way with loads of peppers and Jalapeños! Keep up the personal service it sets you apart from the rest!"}
{"text":"I am hooked...great sub, must eat it right away, its a drippy bugger and will get soggy if you store it overnight....silly good though, EAT NOW!!  Get some!   No brainer for a low baller...5 stars I ask why, because its the quality prep, the NJ accents and the product...."}
{"text":"The staff here was amazing. Smiles everywhere and my Italian sandwich was made Mike's way, which is tasty tasty. Whoever you are, thank you Mike."}
{"text":"It's always nice to be greeted upon entering. I have heard great things about Jersey Mike's but never had the pleasure of eating there. The food definitely lived up to the reputation set beforehand. I had the big kahuna cheese steak. Delicious near, extra cheese, mushrooms, and jalapeños. Muah! I was sad that I could only eat half of it, I wanted it ALL! I tried a bite of Adam's and it was also delicious. (He had the club with extra vinegar & oil)  In addition to the yummy food the employees were so nice and courteous. They even let us know about a deal they have that allows free chips and a drink when you show your movie ticket receipt. How awesome is that?! Well, if you haven't decided to eat here by now what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Love the #7 in a tub. Great for those eating low carb and mikes way is delicious. I add pickles as they give it a special zing.  Service is fast and friendly"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant. The veggie wrap was slimy, wet, and soft of the outside making it difficult to grab with my hands. The contents inside were mushy and not appetizing.   The line was very loud and the staff were carrying their own conversations making it difficult to understand the ordering process.   This place needs some help."}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mike's and go there at least once a week for lunch.  But I go to the Charlotte East Blvd. location specifically for one employee there that is so fantastic and fun.  I can't remember her name but she is just so enthusiastic and friendly.  She says things like \"whatcha having today, Ladybug?\" and \"sign this for me Miss America\" when handing over your credit card receipt.  She has the best energy and you can see people in line watching her and smiling.  The lady ahead of me even told her she had been having a bad day but she had made it much better.  She always makes my day brighter too.  And I always love their sandwiches (#6 Mike's Way, no onions with extra mayo)!"}
{"text":"I like jersey mikes. Subs always good. Nothing incredible, just good. I have been to a few different locations. BUT I am leaving this review because of this location specifically. The service when I went here was outstanding, and I had a great experience. It was late on a Friday night in June and my husband and I stopped in when they were very close to closing. The guys were already doing some of the closing cleanup. We assumed the 2 young guys would be kind of dismissing and quick with us and be annoyed that they would have to unpack some of the things they had already put away. It was exactly the opposite. It was like we were VIPs. They were both so nice and so helpful and made suggestions and didn't rush us at all. We talked for like 2 days about how great they were and what a great experience we had. Didn't expect that kind of experience just stopping in quickly to a jersey mike's. I meant to call and tell the manager how great our experience was but didn't get to it. If the service is always like that, I highly recommend getting subs from this Jersey Mike's!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes has GREAT subs but still isn't a replacement for Subway.   While I love their turkey sub, they don't have a very wide variety of sandwich toppings and I don't like their tuna. (I need black olives and spinach! Maybe I'm just spoiled.)  I'll come here for a turkey sub but if I feel like tuna I'll stick to subway.  When I came with my cousin she ordered a sub with nothing but mayo and lettuce on it and after some laughter the guy behind the counter refused to let her pay for such a measly sandwich. When she ordered the same thing at Subway they charged her for a veggie anyways. It was pretty cool of him."}
{"text":"Slow as shit. They always seem like they have a bunch of newbies and have my subs wrong on several occasions"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Jersey Mike's and this location is no different. Great service with a smile. Doesn't hurt that I can grab a tea next door....  My favorite is the Big Kahuna easy on the jalapeños.   There was a line the entire time I was here and they kept it moving quickly. Seating available inside and out."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the state of the restaurant and the staff. I'm afraid the owner or manager isn't paying any attention to this location and because of this I won't be back.   The soda machine sprays everywhere (still) when your trying to get your drink. The store wasn't clean and the person making my sandwich had long hair hanging in his eyes that he kept touching. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Great crew there.  Got a turkey wrap, mike's way.  Little wet with the oil, i don't like that much.  However the crew there helped me out to my car (on crutches lately) and were great group of kids that worked there.  Food was great, better than subway IMHO."}
{"text":"They were a little nervous when the hot sub shop moved in next door; but each place fills a need and this place does just fine.  Gets pretty busy at lunch but they recognize me and my turkey wrap no cheese mike's way is almost my signature sandwich now.  The turkey seems to be the pressed turkey that subway uses but I like it nonetheless.  I wish they used the unprocessed turkey breast but overall a great sub shop."}
{"text":"I am obssessed.  I work very close to Jersey Mikes, and I used to go once a week or sometimes twice to get the Buffalo Chicken Wrap! (IT'S BEEN A YEAR!) It's delicious..as much as the other sandwiches & wraps look good, I can't let go of my favorite thing. haha Everybody knows what I want as soon as I walk in. Some even know my name :) They are so friendly! Sometimes I'm not even hungry, but go & order something just cause I like the atmosphere and them. haha   Way better than any other wraps or sandwiched I've ever tasted!  GO!!!! You wont regret it!!  PS: it gets busy!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwiches ever!   Thinly sliced meats... were talking tissue paper thin! delicious!  No substitutions No difficult orders... very straight forward. I can literally recommend every sandwich on the whole menu! Great staff too but the food stands alone!"}
{"text":"No greeting or eye contact. Left after about 5mins of uncomfortable silence. I just want a sandwich,  Im not trying to fuck your girlfriend."}
{"text":"The subs are good. I tell you though, when I asked about discounts I was told they didn't have any. So I said,\"I thought you did military discounts.\" Then the correction was made by saying oh yes we honor military discounts with photo ID. Sooo this slipped your mind? Good thing I followed up with my comment or else I would not have received a discount. I'll continue to patronize."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than a warm sandwich from Jersey Mikes. If you are hungry this will cure your hunger. Don't hesitate to stop, they will treat you right all the time."}
{"text":"Honestly, best sandwich / sub place. I was driving around all day taking care of some personal affairs and I decided to stop in for the first time and give it a try. Great little place. Awesome friendly staff, great food, friendly people and a great clean location. Honestly if you have not tried it, you should take the time to stop in and try.   Thank You Jersey Mike's for a great experience and great food.  Will be back for sure. Sincerely: Charlie."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's, specifically this location, is basically the 'Dutch Bros' of sub places, and that's NOT a compliment. The place could be empty and by the time you actually leave, 10-15 minutes isn't uncommon. Seems like they're hiring too many ASU kids or something, because if you're going to come to work stoned, at least make sure you can still do your job... They ask you everything you want upfront, and then forget and make you repeat multiple times.. Ask as you go.. The food's not bad, but the service/experience is horrible. Also the awkward end where they are afraid about mentioning a tip, but then act self-righteous if they don't get one? You just wasted 10 minutes of my time, with 3 of you somehow making 1 sub, in a completely empty place... Honestly surprised they're not closed yet."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean and nearby my office! I grabbed the monster sandwich . They are huge and my favorite sandwiches by a big chain restaurant like this. I get it \"Mikes Way\" (hold the onions) which gives it the perfect taste. Unless you live under a rock you've been here before and should definitely come back. Much love to Jersey Mike's and down with Jj's!!!!"}
{"text":"After a long afternoon out shopping, my fiancé and I decided to stop into the recently opened Jersey Mike's for a quick bite. We'd both heard rave reviews about this place from his sister in-law who frequents it out in the East valley.  We were looking forward to finally trying it out for ourselves.  The restaurant is in a neat little corner plaza surrounded by other great eateries, all of which share a really great courtyard patio with lots of community-style seating.  We entered the establishment from the courtyard, which is technically the back of the shop, and walked in to see what was in store for us.  The place was clean and brightly lit, with music blaring from the speakers.  It was definitely too loud, as we had to fight to not only hear each other, but also the people at the counter.  After we were greeted, I had to ask the counter people to repeat everything at least twice.  Not good, especially when my fiancé overheard a girl on the prep line say to another customer that she couldn't hear what they said on account of the music.  After we decided on our sandwiches, we placed our orders and moved through the line.  I ordered a hot sub, the chipotle Philly chicken cheesesteak (or something to that effect) and my fiance ordered a turkey & provolone.  We were handed a ticket which only had my order written on it and it took us a minute to figure out they only write the hot sub orders and have you go through the assembly line for cold subs.  It took a while to get through the line; there was one girl adding toppings to the cold subs, one guy standing by waiting to wrap the finished subs in paper, and another girl running the register.  In addition, one woman was running the hot sub station on her own, the manager-type was taking cold sub orders, and another guy was mopping the floor (Really? With customers in the store?).  Something happened at the register, and I had to stand there for ten minutes waiting for my receipt.  By that time, we had my fiancé's sub but were still waiting for mine.  The woman running the hot station started calling the name Roger. When no one responded to that name, she came out onto the floor and started asking everyone personally if they were Roger.  She just kind of stood there looking confused, so I thought to ask her what kind of sub she had prepared.  Turns out, it was my sub.  The name we had given, which was also on the ticket, was Bryan.  Yeah, not even close.  By that point, we'd been in there for close to 20 minutes and were very underwhelmed by the service we'd been given.  We took our food home to (hopefully) enjoy it.  The subs weren't bad.  They weren't great, either.  I expected my hot sub to be full of flavor and spice, but instead it was just a chicken sub with peppers, a bit too much cheese, and not much in the way of the chipotle mayo that should have been on it.  Bryan's turkey and provolone wasn't anything to write home about.  The bread on both of our sandwiches was average - soft all around and soggy with all of the condiments.  Neither came close to being as great as Jimmy John's, and for what I paid, I would go to Subway over Jersey Mike's.  I really hope this place makes some improvements to their customer service, and at the very least, they should turn down the music a few notches - that might help with the communication issues."}
{"text":"Definitely better than Subway thinking of their meat makes me sick. Anyhoo I always get the Philly with chipotle mayo and it is deeelish!  Jersey Mike's is little expensive and that's why I don't come here a lot but you get what you pay for I can't think of another place where you can get a better sub."}
{"text":"Really good subs made fresh. Not to many options which is nice. Just the fan favorites. The staff is really nice to. There is a subway just down the street and I haven't been there since I found out about jersey mikes!"}
{"text":"Ordered online walked into the store to pick up where they suggested to pick up an online order. And had to wait 45 minutes until my order was ready what is the point of having to order online walk up to get it and cut the line if your order is not ready and you have to wait when you get in the store and watch all the other customers that walk in to order get their food first."}
{"text":"Ordered a ham and cheese sandwich today and was delighted. The sandwich was delicious and great customer service. Much better than Jimmy Jons,"}
{"text":"The big kahuna & the Italian are very good. Been a fan for a year now. Clean & reliable. I recommend highly. Martin"}
{"text":"JERSEY MIKE'S IS EXPENSIVE FOR A SANDWICH SHOP! Just letting you know that right off the bat if you have yet to go there. Not quite sure what makes their ingredients so much different from the rest that's on planet Earth to warrant their pricing. But I digress. Beyond that the sub I had was very good. I tried the large chicken Parmesan (which will throw you back alittle over $11. That's just for the sandwich. So yeah, the people that work there probably have to work 2 hours to afford a sandwich there.) and I was not disappointed one bit. The only problem I had when I first got there was how to order. I thought it was like Subway so I was expecting them to ask me what I wanted on it while they were making it. But they just made it and wrapped it up without asking me what else I wanted on it. So word to the wise. Make sure u know exactly what you want on it the moment you order."}
{"text":"The guys that work at this location are awesome. Had a good time chatting it up and offered the best customer experience. This is what builds a brand! Genuine people!"}
{"text":"It's great that they opened but don't deliver unless it's big order, too bad I order daily. Guess the loyal cust isn't important enough. Guess Jimmy John's will continue to get my business.  Was really looking forward to them, as they say \"That's life\"."}
{"text":"The meats are sliced fresh for each sandwich.  The bread is fresh and very flavorful.  The price for the size is great!  I wish they had other sides other than chips.  And I have a card I get punched so every 10th sandwich is free.  I think Jersey Mike's blows Port of Subs out of the water!  Subway is average and very generic."}
{"text":"If I'm craving a quick sub, Jersey Mike's is where it's at. Much better than Subway and this location is right down the street from my house."}
{"text":"The subs are great, as always, but let me just just say he staff there is amazing! I don't know where they found those guys! They're funny they're polite and professional and they do their job fast! Always pleasant experience:)"}
{"text":"The manager was a bit of a jerk. My friend and I ordered a Pastromi on white bread with just pastrami and no cheese or onions due to allergies. When we got our sandwiches we could tell that it had onions and cheese we walked over to the counter and explained that due to allergies we could not have cheese or onions once again. The Owner popes up and said that's the only way we make it and that there is nothing they can do... I was so upset I placed the sandwich on their counter and walked out..."}
{"text":"Just like the rating says on here, they are A-OK. After my second visit here, I am confident enough to say that they are quite simply a traditional sub shop, like subway used to be before Jared waded over and lost all the weight. Lets discuss the pros and cons of Jersey Mikes - Tempe.  ~Fud/Drink~ Jersey Mikes, first off, has solid, traditional, sub options. If you want a simple Italian sub with extra olive oil, and tasty Italian meats, come here and munch down. If you want a foofie Hawaiian pineapple open faced mozzarella sub (just made that up, it sounds good) then go elsewhere. Their food options are pretty simple, but the meats help make each sub. Overall, they offer just a a couple of add-in options to your sub and they aren't high quality, especially the lettuce and tomatoes.  The tomatoes are pretty slimy, not super-fresh and the lettuce seems to be of the bagged variety. The bread is average as well, nothing amazing to write home about. The onions actually looked nice, they were presented in their dish all pre-strung, rather than chopped up. They were also white onions, not the traditional red, which I actually enjoyed better on the sub. But once again, the meats...they are great. Overall, its a shame they don't put more stock in everything besides the meat, because they did a good job there. They have no beers by the way, a soda fountain with regular options will do just fine. If you need a beer, Wingstop next store has a number of beers on stock.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ The service here is near-perfect. They are fast, friendly and intelligently listen to your order. The sub came down the assembly line and was in the hands of the toppings-adder (what is the title of this person anyway?) quickly. I did take issue with the fact that the pieces of cheese they added on the sub were about as thin as I get at the deli at a supermarket, super-thin, that is. Normally you expect a couple semi-thick slices of cheese, but the provolone slivers they gave me were so small I could barely taste that flavor. After accepting my request for extra lettuce and tomatoes I went and asked for some sides in cups which he dished for me in fast order as well. There is no true ambiance to the place, they have a simple set up with chairs and tables, music isn't a priority. Its a sub-shop guys.  ~Extras/Rating!~ They taste MUCH better than the generic Subway. Please just discard Subway and eat at a real sub shop like this one. You get so much more when you eat a spot like this. I do hope JM's takes a look into better quality minus the meat.  They do a real good job at customer service and the management knows how to train their employees well. The subs hold up well against other competitors. However I feel as though I am paying more than necessary for a sandwich that is pretty average besides the items I already laid out for you.  I wish they would let us do take home service of their meats, that would be great. This place is deserving of better than 3 stars, maybe 3 1/2...But we don't have that option, do we ;-) ? Would I come back? YES! I have tried two completely different items, and it seems Italian is the best route. I am not an Italian sub guy per-say, but this is a tasty treat if I am in that mood. Try your best to make your first sub an Italian one, and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Having been to this location a few times now, I think I'll return to Subway for my lunch breaks from now on. People seem to like food from here when they order cold sandwiches, so please be warned, this is only from hot sandwich experience, which was meh. They make the hot sandwiches away from view and put so much dressing on them that the sandwich is always soggy. So gross! If they would have warned me that I wouldn't get to specify toppings, like the cold sandwich people do, I would have been able to let them know when I ordered, but they took my order, said nothing to me, then just gave my sandwich to the register. I never got to customize it or anything. I guess now I know, but for a first time customer, it would have been nice to have them ask."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is a chain....alright get all your prejudices out. Now that you're hopefully thinking from a logical and rational place, go and enjoy this particular Jersey Mike's on Charleston because what you'll find is a tasty and inexpensive sub shop.  The kids who man the shop are friendly, accommodating and it seems to be the kind of place thats a great fit for the Summerlin community.  Im a huge fan of the Ham and Capicola, but in reality all the sandwiches are tasty.  They slice the meat when you order and for all of you that think that doesn't matter, ask ANY reliable chef and they will tell this locks in the freshness better than the Subway/Quizno method of pre-slicing individual portions.  Make sure you get the sandwiches \"Mikes Way\" which tops it all with a healthy dose of oil and balsamic vinegar.  This dressing really brings the 'wiches together.  They have an equal amount of hot sandwiches and cold ones and the bread they use is decent (wish that part was better).  Im not going to speak for all Jersey Mike locations but this one is run the way a store should be run.  Great spot also to grab a to go lunch if you're heading up for an afternoon of activities in Red Rock Canyon as it son the way.  Alright all you chain haters, you can go back to hating, Ill just continue appreciating...."}
{"text":"A small Philly steak sub (they call it a regular size here) is $7.45 and a large (they call it a giant here) is $12.95. They do not toast the sub bun. They do not offer whiz instead of Swiss cheese. This is just for a sub--no chips, no pickle, nor other go-with. The sandwich itself had an appropriate amount of meat, cheese and peppers and onions. It tasted OK--not anything special. There seemed to be a great confusion on who had paid and who had not.  A couple of hygiene issues emerged as I watched the cold subs prepared. The young man assembling and cutting the cold subs was also handling money at the cash register with out changing gloves nor washing his hands. The order slip was placed directly on the cut surface of sub roll. The dining area looked clean with tables and chairs. Parking is close to the door."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Jersey Mike's for a while and it didn't disappoint. Not only was I greeted with joy when I walked in the door, I was met with excitement over the fact that it was my first time there.  The sandwich was delicious and delightfully messy. I got the #9 which is turkey, roast beef and Swiss (I swapped it with provolone with no hassle). I loved every bite.  I was also given a free cookie. Who can be mad about that? No one! No one can be mad at a free cookie."}
{"text":"i was here October 8, 2013.  i had heard about this place- there's one not too far from where i live. i keep wanting to try it but never get around to it.  i had a layover in Las Vegas so i figured i'd try it. i got the original italian- they put on lettuce and tomatoes and some sort of relish and oil/vinegar, olive, pickles, peppers.  i was pleasantly surprised!! i'm in an airport at least a few times a month and the choices are usually pretty bad.  now, all of you stuffy wanna-be food connoisseurs will probably take offense to me liking this spot. but, a good sandwich is a good sandwich!"}
{"text":"The service is great, the people are friendly, the wait is not too bad even at lunch time, and your sub gets made right there in front of you. BUT the ingredients in the subs are just meh.   get some real capicola, I am not sure what cappacuolo is but what they serve barely qualifies as capicola. It would be nice if they served a hot (spicy) capicola.   Their subs could be so much better."}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes is ok, but certainly not a place I would recommend to anyone from Jersey, or anywhere else for that matter. Unfortunately for Jersey Mike, I've eaten at White House Subs in Atlantic City so my expectations were pretty high. I was sorely disappointed.  The ingredients were good, the dressing above average, and the staff was friendly, however, one of the main ingredients of a good sub is the roll itself and Jersey Mike's bread was way off the mark. The roll was dry, its shell spongy and not crusty, and there was an overwhelming amount of dry crumb, so much so, not even the dressing would soften it.  For one large sub, two drinks and a bag of chips, the bill came to nineteen dollars. Sorry Jersey Mike, but a cutesy Point Pleasant sign and dry bread doesn't do it for me.  I can get the same level of happiness from Subway where for half the price I can get one of their god-awful creations masquerading as a submarine sandwich."}
{"text":"Looked for something quick and easy right off the freeway, and trusted Yelp on this one. Nice and easy location to get to. Parking was a bit tight, but it was lunch hour on a weekday so it was expected. The line inside was fast, the staff was friendly and accommodating. The food was awesome and hearty, and the prices were reasonable. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Long wait, expensive. Got chicken parmigiana and it had fat in it. For $15 for a fatty long wait sandwich. No thanks."}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich to be delivered by Grub-hub. On my instructions to Jersey Mike's, I asked for extra provolone (and was charged for it). I ordered the giant sandwich and asked that they only place lettuce on half the sandwich. Lettuce was on the entire sandwich. Then, they ask for you to enter a tip. I gave 20 percent. Grub hub did a great job of delivering my food. Too bad Jersey Mike's doesn't know how to follow instructions!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, there are a ton of choices if you're looking for a quick bite while shopping at the Happy Valley Towne Center, but if you're in the mood for a quick sandwich then Jersey Mikes is always a safe bet. As far as chain sandwich shops in the area go, the Js (Jersey Mikes and Jimmie Johns) always seem to rise to top. Jersey Mikes always delivers fresh and satisfying sandwiches. I think the key is their fresh bread and generous dollops of mayonnaise. If I'm in a healthy (guilty) mood, then I usually go with a simple #7 - the turkey and provolone, piled with veggies and light on the mayo. If I'm feeling like I want to indulge, I go with the #13 Italian with extra onions.  I have never been disappointed at Jersey Mikes....though their numbering system does leave me a bit confused....Next time, I'll order a #4 and see what I get!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location has decided to arbitrarily not accept valid offers that are specific to this location. I've eaten here many times before and the subs were pretty good. However considering their latest bait and switch techniques to get customers in the door and then deny them a valid offer,  I won't be back."}
{"text":"DO NOT call in an order, pick it up, and expect to get home with what you ordered.  My son and his family traveled to Gilbert for the Easter weekend. He requested Jersey Mike's. I called in the order and the person who took the order repeated everything back to me correctly. My husband picked it up assuming it was correct. Not one sandwich out of the six I ordered was right...not the right bread, condiments, etc.  so disappointing!  I absolutely hate when restaurants do this because you obviously are not going to drive back and have them fix the order. Should never happen."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I love the club sub. The environment is great and the employees are awesome I come once a week now at the least. Keep up you guys are doing awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Jersey Mike's ever since they came to Phoenix and it's always been great. I've gone to many locations totaling 100+ subs and they have been delicious every single time.  Tonight, however, I experienced something more than their fantastic food and customer service. I went in at about 8:10, little less than an hour before closing. The store was absolutely spotless as usual (I have never seen a dirty floor or messy table, even when it's busy) and judging by the few toppings left, it had been a productive day.  I chatted with the General Manager, discussed how busy both of our days were, and unlike most places of service, I always feel like I'm genuinely cared about as a customer at Jersey Mike's. No fake high-pitched \"Starbucks\" tones, no distant blank stares of boredom or automation. After a great conversation, they purchased my meal. I gave as much of a tip as my wallet had in it (one measly dollar) and left the store. Currently eating a delicious sandwich.  People often ask \"what happened to the human connection?\" It's real, and it's still out there. Talk to people, help those you interact with throughout your day, even in passing. And try to realize how much of a difference it makes to you and to others.  Tonight, I experienced something more than great food and service. Tonight I experienced the power of human kindness.  Thank you, to the whole team at Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!  Fresh subs all the time!!  Love the #5....3 meets and cheese.  Always a good lunch place for a quick bite or to go.  So glad there is one in my new neighborhood.  Very clean restroom facilities as well!!  Two thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"I got turned on to Jersey Mike's subs on a business trip, so I was pleasantly surprised to see one close to me in Phoenix. I love the sandwiches they make and love that I can see them slice the meat and cheese in front of me. But what makes this store great is the staff.  They are always friendly, they remember how I like my sub made and they seem to truly like their jobs.  I was in the store once when they were training new employees and I was impressed on how much they stressed cleanliness, personal appearance and customer service."}
{"text":"We ordered a sandwich platter for our family to enjoy back at our hotel room after our Wedding. The key word here is ENJOY! My family is mostly from Chicago & we know about a good Sub sandwich. Mike's does not disappoint. They really took care of us all the way. We had more than enough sandwiches to feed the hungry crowd (who definitely ate their fill),with plenty of leftovers for later. They gave us plenty of condiments,oils,etc... They even threw in a huge tub of potato salad on the house.   I would definitely recommend the roast beef. It's made fresh at the store (each day I believe). Although everything we had was fantastic!   Thanx ~Jersey Mike's!"}
{"text":"AMAZING customer service! Personality and they were so accommodating to the particular sandwich that I wanted! I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"The subs here are HOT! No, not just toasted, but genuinely hot! It's only with certain subs, but oh my god it's so good and any cheese you get will be nice and melted. Only issues are a somewhat long wait and high price, but they do have a student deal."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Jersey Mike's and thought it was so good.  I got the philly cheese steak and it was made perfect.  The atmosphere and bread reminded me of Jimmy Johns so I was already in love with the place.  I'm looking forward to go back and try a different sandwich so I can accurately compare to other sub restaurants.  The workers were helpful and very nice.  I highly recommend trying out Jersey Mike's!!"}
{"text":"For someone who doesn't eat out a lot this place is awesome. Staff is very friendly for a small shop, and you can tell they took the time to make my hot sandwich fresh. Great little atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place!! We don't eat here frequently, but when we do, they never let us down! I wish it weren't so difficult to hear in there, but other than that it's great. Our favorites are the 13 and 43!"}
{"text":"Second time I've been here and I ordered a \"Sub in a Tub\" of the turkey sub. I found it a bit hard to hear in the facility, but my order was done correctly and the salad was satisfactory. The only drawback I found is there aren't many options for veggie toppings. My salad consisted of turkey, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers and jalapenos. I normally wouldn't get bell peppers and jalapenos in a salad, but I didn't have much else to choose from. Subway has other toppings such as cucumbers, green peppers, spinach, and olives. It would be nice if Jersey Mike's could include one or two more veggie toppings."}
{"text":"Last week my crew from the fire station decided to get sandwiches at Jersey Mike's Subs. This location has a new owner who had stopped by the station a couple weeks earlier and invited us up to check the place out. It's pretty rare that the whole crew (10 guys) agrees on anything food related, but Jersey Mike's worked well for all of us.     I'm a big club sandwich fan so I had the Club Sub. It was loaded with plenty of delicious ham, bacon, turkey and provolone. I got it Mike's Way which includes tomatoes, lettuce, onions, spices, oil and vinegar. The bread was freshly made and quite good. A few of the guys tried the Original Italian and they all raved about how good it was, so I'll try that next time.     In short, everyone at the station was happy Jersey Mike's and I'm sure that they made 10 customers from our visit. The service was great and the new owner is a great guy. I noticed yesterday that the store is being renovated so you may want to check to be sure they have reopened."}
{"text":"This place is a little out of the way but we made the trip because this particular location had almost five stars. And In my opinion it was well worth the drive.   The meats are sliced to order and bread fresh baked. We ordered two club sandwiches it came with turkey ham and bacon with provolone cheese. I believe they had a few different choices of bread  but We choose white bread  and omitted a few condiments and a personal favorite of mine is shredded lettuce i don't know why but shredded lettuce is just better. The portion size of the sandwiches are huge fair warning lol I couldn't finish the medium one.   I loved every single bite.   The staff was quick and very friendly. This location was super clean and had plenty of seats to dine in. I'm looking forward to our next visit for sure!"}
{"text":"I've recently grown to love this place. And I'm definitely a fan of the customer service and atmosphere.  It's nice that they prepare the sandwiches and cut the meats fresh in front of you. The first two times I went I was not impressed by the food.. I had the cheesesteak and also a wrap. Both of which are nothing extraordinary. Actually, the wrap was pretty pathetic portion-wise for how much they charged for it.  My recent experiences have been nothing but stellar. I have got the NUMBER 9 every time. Roast beef, turkey, bacon, chesse, and Mike's way always makes it an amazing meal.   The staff are super customer service oriented too. They were making the wrong order for me and just combined the two sandwiches like I asked - which resulted in a Mike's Gargantuan more or less. Another time, it was near closing and they forgot to put bacon on my #9 and my friend's. So, I told them and they literally gave me with a pound of bacon for my trouble.  All in all, my experiences with Jersey Mike's makes it a wonderful option for sandwiches."}
{"text":"Hit the Spot   As I was driving, heading home from work, I began thinking about what to have for dinner. All I knew is I had a hankering for a sub, so  I decided to check out Jersey Mike's; it turned out to be an excellent decision.  I ordered three Original Italian's and a roast beef and provolone.  As I walked up to the counter I was greeted by the employees who took my order and started preparing my order in no time.  The bread at Jersey Mike's is perfectly, soft, fresh and tasty.  The meats and cheese were definitely fresh and plentiful.  I ordered my sub \"Mike's Way\" which meant it came with Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Vinegar, Oil and Spices. The sandwiches were delicious, reasonably priced, and great customer service.   If your hungry for a sandwich give a Jersey Mike's A try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really enjoy jersey Mikes. The fresh cut cold cuts and the choices of condiments. It's always fresh and consistent. As a previous reviewer noted, I had to take a star off for the table being dirty and the clerk wasn't that courteous. If you want to go strictly off the sandwich it's a 5. I try to put all aspects of the dining experience into my review. I would go back based on the quality of their product"}
{"text":"Afraid it might just be like all the others, it took me years to finally try Jersey Mike's. Suffice to say, they are leaps and bounds above the mediocrity that is Subway. Meats and cheeses sliced fresh and stacked aplenty -- with actual flavor, too! -- and very good bread. Well worth the coupla extra dollars you'll spend."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and awesome staff! Very friendly and fast service, even at the lunch time rush."}
{"text":"The guy with a beard and tattoos is a bit of a passive aggressive d-lord. I get it you close in a hour and a half but dont get mad that people are walking in. I worked in food industry almost all my life and there is a right way and a wrong way to talk to customers.  I almost walked out but i wanted a freaking sub sandwich. Employees in any restaurant need to remember that the customer doesnt work there and doesnt know all the ins and outs like you do so when they ask or do something that isnt the status quo dont be a passive aggressive ass."}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes is by far my most favorite place to eat a sub! However, time and time again they mess up our orders. I get the fact that a lot of us aren't Mayo Fans but for those of us who are... We love it! Let's remember to put that on the subs for those of us who like it. And why when you order the number 8 is there no bacon on my sandwich every single time?  The club sub comes with ham, turkey, bacon, and mayo and they leave off the bacon and mayo more times than its on the sandwich. Its not listed as optional... it should come the way the menu displays, \"#8 Club Sub: Turkey, ham, provolone, applewood smoked bacon and mayo.\" Our office will order wheat sandwiches.... we get white sandwiches. All in all the food is very good but the consistency is EXTREMELY POOR. You get whatever the employees feel like putting on the sandwich. So disappointing when you know how good the sandwiches could be...."}
{"text":"There are few places I just have to go back to all of the time. But Jersey Mikes is one of those places. This location in particular. I live on happy valley road with one 3 miles away from me but I make the trip down to Bell for the following key points. The staff is so friendly they remember your names after visiting a few times and they always make sure you leave happy. The subs taste amazing and they make sure you are pleased with what you are getting. And everything is reasonably priced which is perfect for my college budget.  The bread meat and toppings are all fresh as well as all of the cookies and brownies.  I look forward to my next visit every time."}
{"text":"Subs are good but the service is another story. The teenage girls working behind the counter act like they could care less about the person they are serving."}
{"text":"Me & my husband love this place. Taste like sub place in Chicago. I get the Italian & my husband gets chipotle cheese steak their awesome! Big size literally was good enough for 2 meals"}
{"text":"This was my first time at jersey mikes....and my last. I am disgusted. Come in with one person working, I ordered a chicken bacon rance cheese steak and the kid working went in the back with his gloves on and came back out with the gloves on I'm sure after he touched everything back there holding raw frozen chicken. He then took my boyfriends sandwich which was a club sub. The guy didn't change his gloves, cut rock hard bread because they set it out on the counter and then grabbed all the meat and cheese for his sandwich with the same gloves all the way back from when he touched the raw chicken!!!! He then proceeded to cut both the meat and cheese on the same slicer which is against health code, and put the veggies on his sandwich with the same gloves and mayo that's been sitting out all day. We then got drinks and the side of the soda machine was disgusting and sticky the ice dispenser was brown on the inside. I'm am actually disgusted!! I will never ever step foot into a jersey mikes again. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty sandwich made with fresh ingredients and my exact topping preference, friendly staff, in a bright, clean location.  This place is all that I love about Jersey Mike's!   If you've never been before, it's a really simple sub shop, similar to what you'd find on the East Coast, with fresh ingredients, yummy bread and simple decor.  They don't have a ton of fancy options, but everything is delicious!  Their vegetarian sandwich is a cheese sub with green peppers - my husband and I split the Giant.  They're a tiny bit more expensive than some other sadnwich shops, but their ingredients and service make them a big favorite with us.  Open until 9pm on Sundays!"}
{"text":"This location has all of the usual elements: the service is great, the ingredients are very fresh, and the offerings are simple and tasty.  Jersey Mike's bread is my favorite sandwich bread in town (must be the result of my Philly roots).  Getting it Mike's Way really makes for a great sandwich, too:  it's a fantastic combination of lettuce, tomato, onion, red wine vingear (the more, the better!), olive oil (I prefer just a splash), oregano and salt!   My husband and I usually split a Giant Veggie sandwich, which comes for two kinds of cheese and green peppers.  It's a pretty good deal (not priced like Subway, but doesn't taste like Subway, either)."}
{"text":"Hands down the best service in town!  We were regulars here for a long time (only stopped coming after moving far away). The staff is amazing and the subs are fresh and delicious. We usually get the veggie.  Their bread is lovely and the veggie's great, especially with lots of red wine vinegar.   Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Really 3.5 stars. My Philly was good.  Hot, seemed fresh, good helping of meat.  The staff seemed annoyed (both guys).  No idea why. They may have added bread selections.  I thought I heard a third choice, but I just went with the wheat and didn't pay attention.  Overall a respectable sub.  I am rounding up because the food is better than three stars, and their email club sends out good coupons from time to time.  They should look to add craft sodas. Rocket Burger had Batch sodas on fountain, and they were great. Would be a good for here too."}
{"text":"This is my first review on yelp of any kind, that being said service is horrible. The girl who took my order and the other guests that are behind me skipped over making my sub and proceeded to make all the cold subs first before she even started cooking my chicken.   I've waited long enough to download the Yelp app just now and write this review. Beware if you're on a lunch break go to Subway it's right next door."}
{"text":"As always a great sandwich. Rare roast beef on rosemary bread mikes way. Chips & a root beer. Tastes like Jersey which I miss dearly."}
{"text":"Walked in asked if they have rare roast beef. End cut all dried out so we left. Girl wasn't very nice either. Will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"Most Jersey Mike's don't have Sweet Tea. This location does. Plus they had Rare Roast Beef for my #6 reg sub. Love this location. Life couldn't be any sweeter"}
{"text":"Wow they went to the back to get rarer roast beef for me. So happy. Love this location"}
{"text":"I always get the #6 if they have rare Roast beef. If not the #13. The sandwiches here are way better then subway. The bread is crispy & when you take out the dough it's just perfect. Make it a combo with chips & sweet tea & your Happy."}
{"text":"TWO STARS FOR TOO EXPENSIVE!  I came here hungry and left broke and still hungry!  I only ordered a (7\") Regular Sub Sandwich a Bag of Chips and a Regular Size Drink and it cost me over $13.00 WOW!  They don't even give you a FOOTLONG sandwich here. What's up with that? Your choices are 7\" or 15\" in length ONLY! Keep in mind, this is considered a fast food restaurant, at these prices I could have went to a sit down restaurant chain and have got much more food for my money at a better price.  The sandwich was very good, but good and small, not even a FOOTLONG, like Subway. A Reg. Sub here is only 7\" in length, average price between $7.45-$7.95 and a Giant Sub, is about $12.95 about 15\" in length. They made my sandwich, rang me up and then gave my sandwich to the guy ahead of me who got his To-Go, they then asked me what I ordered and had to remake my sandwich over again. SMH... Needless to say a costly dinner, and I still left hungry. I guess this is why I always end up at Subway if I want a fresh FOOTLONG Sub Sandwich for about $6 Bucks!  Jersey Mike's... Expensively Priced Subs!"}
{"text":"I love the Jersey Mike's on Eastern Ave! My kids go in with their Papa once a week if not more after pre-school for lunch. The team there is so nice to my kids and know them by name. They have always been so kind and so patient. I have always been a Jersey Mike's fan when we were in North Carolina because I love their food, but the one here in Henderson is by far my favorite because of the people!"}
{"text":"i love this chain, and this location espically! friendly staff and the manager working today (monday) at 10:30 was extremely helpful when it came to suggesting a new sandwhich for me to try. this is my favorite location in all of arizona! great job guys!!!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Great deli meat. Great sandwiches. Great pit stop for people driving through. Just off the highway in a strip mall."}
{"text":"I went today about 6 or 7 minutes before closing ... I asked the employee witch was Native American I believe if it was cool if I ordered he said yeah with a rude undertoned voice and told me you do know we have 5 minutes to closing. I'm done coming here because of that rude guy it's the second time I get treated that way which seems to be every time I go .... Good subs but not worth getting treated like that I'll go to another sub place from now on...."}
{"text":"Good Sandwiches....whenever I am craving a tuna sandwich after a long day on campus I come here!! Tuna sandwich is great. The super sub/roast beef and provolone are good items to try as well. Yet the primo sub of them all here is the Big Kahuna Cheese-steak (grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms, jalapenos and extra cheese!!)  The soups are great to have on a cold winter day!! Also...if you like sandwich wraps as much as I do...you have to have the grilled veggie or chicken ceasar!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time having Jersey Mike's Subs and I must say it was an A+ and five stars. I went to the location right on the corner of warm springs and Las Vegas Boulevard. The parking can be a little bit tricky getting in and out of especially out of it - so you may want to think ahead and give yourself a few extra minutes if you're going to stop by regardless of what time it is because of the outlet mall. Once I got there, they asked me what I wanted very pleasantly and I asked for a turkey avocado and Swiss which apparently isn't on the menu but they made it happen anyways and they said it was a California. I also picked up the original Italian for my boyfriend and that was fantastic.   I think this is one of my new favorite sandwich spots in Las Vegas and I will be coming back here often for the California."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is decent airport food. Gayle and I were connecting through LAS and this place was close to our Southwest Departure gate. I ate my sandwich (forgot the number but is was turkey and cheese) at the Pei Wei Bar and had another one made for my 20 year-old son to eat at the gate. A nice sandwich and beer is always a good combination.  Note to the Wise: Bringing a sandwich on your flight is a good idea, but for the benefit of your fellow passengers, try not to make it tuna fish."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, remembered my order from previous visit. Keep up the customer service."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. And quick service. Would recommend coming here if you're in the mood for a sub."}
{"text":"The employee worker Alfredo had great customer service, big props to him!!! Super friendly and upbeat! Helped out greatly with our decision to which sandwhiches to get since it was our first time there! The food was good, not my favorite sandwhich place to go to, nothing really special about them to me, but overall good."}
{"text":"I ordered a sub-in-a-tub Mike's Way. It comes with full slices of tomato, onion and all he lunch meat. When I asked for a knife, the staff behind the counter said they don't have knives. What?!? I really enjoyed sitting at the table watching the rest of my group eat.. Thanks, Jersey Mike's! 2-stars only given because I like the food. Experience was not so good..."}
{"text":"Pretty good subs, not anything special. Average price for lunch. Typically $8-9 for a regular sandwich with chips and drink.  Pay attention to the daily specials and sign up for the jersey mikes card, you get points for every sandwich you buy, then eventually get a free one.  Always very clean, staff is constantly cleaning off tables, or their sandwich making line.  Staff is good, nice, and quick. They go a little heavy on the mayo and oil/vinegar FYI-I usually ask for it lite, and still get more than I want."}
{"text":"Came in and felt very rushed to the point that they did not ask my fiance what he would like on his sandwich. The guy behind the counter was messing around with his apron longer then it took them to make our sandwich. He also did not replace his gloves after doing so. I called the local number on the receipt to tell the GM and he apologized for this and stated he would send coupons. Took my info down and never sent them. Very very poor experience. I wasn't even looking for a freebe but still disappointed to not get what he said he would send."}
{"text":"Great service from the intial greeting at the door to the assembly of my sub to the cashier that rung me out. Pepsi fountain is clean and mixture of soda is perfect. Clean dining room."}
{"text":"MAN! This place is good.  The best bread, great meats and always friendly staffers.  My biggest challenge is deciding on the Club, which has bacon,  or the incredible pastrami.  In fact, this photo is all that's left."}
{"text":"Food was OK(usually pretty consistent among the Jersey Mike's locations I've been to), but this location specifically seems to skimp on ingredients. I ordered a cheesesteak and my girlfriend got an Italian sub(both \"standard\" size), and both left us feeling underwhelmed and still hungry afterwards. The bread was obviously normal size, but the density of meat/etc inside of the sandwich wasn't great. We'd been here previously and didn't recall this, so perhaps it depends on who's working. Other reviews seem to indicate this wasn't a one-off, though."}
{"text":"The best! The staff is super nice, and they remember you also.  Always clean! I don't live close by, but I will go out of my way to come here. Keep it up, guys!"}
{"text":"Our favorite sub shop super yummy fresh ingredients, very flavorful, lots of selection!! It's nice they have a little punch card now to earn free food, just wish they had French Fry's as a side lol"}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mikes! I mean how could i not Jersey is my hometown Jersey till i dIE!! And mike was my first love lol so its perfect for me! Always fresh always tasting great! Great service !"}
{"text":"Love this Jersey Mikes!  Great food, very clean, family run and very friendly.  They always remember us when we come in.  Can't go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"By far the best place for sandwiches ever! The service is amazing. Two people  in particular go above and beyond to make an amazing mean and provide great customer services. Thanks to Dana and Zack for being the best ever. Can't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"A worker there made a sandwich. The worker keep his gloves on and made another sandwich after ringing someone else up. This is is very unsanitary and I want be back. I will stick with Jimmy Johns or Subway.  OMG---"}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes subs are the bomb! Club sub is my favorite. One of the few sandwich joints that uses crisp warm bacon. Unlike Jimmy Johns which uses cold limp bacon. Make sure to get the red pepper relish. Frickin delish!"}
{"text":"Don't do it!   Resist the temptation.   You get away, and the pull you back in.  Online order, fubared.  Xtra meat/cheese forgotten.  Tuna salad dripping wet, tuna not drained or lettuce soaking wet.  Sandwich was inedible.  Sub in a tub, empty tub, looks like the were out of lettuce.   This is the last time we use the online system, we think they made the sandwiches when we ordered them, not just before pickup.  3 hours, setting in a 'fridge doesn't make a sub better.  HEY, CANCRO, Listen up!  The QC Needs to be addressed.  Incosistancy in product drives customers AWAY.  You also need to train the kids running the store.    Then I called to complain, the asst. Mgr, says, \"can't do anything except refund the xtra meat\".    Don't go, it's NOT worth the pain."}
{"text":"Well the s#$t heads at Jersey Mike's have done it again.   Someone else was picking up our order.  We ordered online, which I do not advise, but under the circumstances, seem to be the best choice.  We ordered: Reg. #8 on whole wheat, NO oil, NO vinegar, No Mayo. This was soaked in vinegar.  Some oil.  Owner said it was like eating a pickle. Reg. #17, extra meat, extra cheese.  Got here stone cold,  Must have been in the fridge for over 1 hour, wrapper was soaking wet from condensation.  American cheese, maybe, certainly not provalone. Reg. #8 on white, also NO oil, NO vinegar, No Mayo.   Swimming in both oil and vinegar, inedible. Reg. #7, on white, also NO oil, NO vinegar, No Mayo.  Extra cheese.  1 tomato slice.  No extra cheese. DON'T USE ON LINE IT SUCKS, WATCH THEM MAKE YOUR SANDWICH.    TO FIX THIS, POS SYSTEM LIKE ARBYS OR ANY OTHER FAST FOOD OUTLET, READ THE ORDER, TRAIN YOUR PEOPLE."}
{"text":"I think I'll make Jersey Mike's my pet project.  After many years working as a process engineer, I think that JM's could use a little of my help.  Looking at the change in reviews over the last couple of years, I can't figure out why they don't fix the problems that keep reoccurring in the local stores.  This last visit is a good example of a major fault in their \"system\".  First of all, as a general comment, don't use the on-line ordering.  They screw this up all the time and you won't know until you get home that they missed something or your sandwiches have been sitting around for a couple of hours because they missed the time delay.  OK, this trip, simple order:  1 Regular Chicken Cheesesteak on Wheat with Provolone cheese and 1 giant Beef Cheesesteak on white with provolone and extra meat.  By the way, extra meat here is not like Subway's double meat, this is a half (or less) portion of the regular serving.  Error 1:  Verbal order, I'm ordering more than one sandwich, so when the girl wants to take the order without writing it down, I dropped one of the sandwiches off the list.  So they lost one giant sandwich there.  Ideally, they should have electronic POS system.  BK's is good, you see what you are ordering on the screen in front of you.  This also documents the order for everyone to use during the preparation.    Error 2:  My order was handed off not once, but twice during my visit.  Here's what happened:  Girl takes order verbally and relays it to Guy 1 at the grille, he starts the sandwiches and walks away to get something else.  Guy 2 takes over the order on the grill and gets AMERICAN CHEESE ready to put on the sandwich.  From past experience, I know to watch what hits the grill and point out the miss to Guy 2.  He then proceeds to put the AMERICAN CHEESE on both sandwiches.  Guy 1 and the Girl remind him again that I wanted Provolone.  Guy 2 had already finished and wrapped the Chicken Cheesesteak, so he unpacked it, PUT IT BACK ON THE GRILL, and added the provolone, rewrapped it and dropped it in a bag.  The other Cheesesteak got the double cheese too, but before it was wrapped.    OK, how to fix. . . ONE person takes the order and this must go into the electronic POS system.  NO hand offs, any one working in process development will tell you the failures and lost time occurs in handoffs to another task or person.     Other issues:  The flattop in these stores is half the size it should be.  Busy stores get behind on the grille work and create delays.  The line runs backwards, the slicer outputs on the left and the line works to the right, this forces the sandwich maker to move around the slicer to put the meats/cheese onto the sandwich.    Every time I go to JM's in the future, I'll add another segment to this story.  Watch my reviews and follow along. . .BobR"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience with shitty ATTITUDE. Bad service w/no training...and yes, this is all about a to go container. I ordered 5 giant subs to-go for a business lunch. All plain and requested the condiments on the side. I have never had such an issue about getting a side of lettuce and tomatoes. He made the biggest deal about a .05 cent  plastic to go containers....HELLO!! I just spent 66 bucks AND gave you a $10 tip on top of it. If anything, I made your day easier by not fully making the subs and putting everything on the side.  Point is, I had a stupid conversation about \"well 5 giants subs would be 25 tomatoes..and i don't want to put a tub of 25 tomatoes in a container.\" I had to like bargain with the man and agreed to only 10 tomatoes and whatever space was left for the lettuce in one container.  Next time, offer the catering platter (which is exactly what I ordered...and the condiments come on the side)"}
{"text":"what a horrible person Jessica is, don't use the word stupid when your talking to people; especially when it is only about a time of when your store opens, and you say it's to early stupid."}
{"text":"Pros: They get your sub done fast. The line was to the door when we stepped in, but got my order in and completed within 7 minutes.  It is really cool to see them slice the meat in front of you.  You know that it is going to be good.  Cons: Not much that I can say.  It was not the best sub sandwich that i have had, but it is very decent for the price.  Conclusion: I would eat here again if I were to visit Ohio!"}
{"text":"Their \"Hoagies\"...(there I said it, and have made it obvious that I am from Philly) are very good.  Not as good as at home, BUT good enough to hit the spot."}
{"text":"Always such wonderful service and even better subs. Beats the heck out of Jimmy John's and Groucho's for sure."}
{"text":"Please please please get this staff a second cash register! Have stopped in for lunch time and it is busy! The staff operates like a well oiled machine, friendly and efficient and then you get to the cash register and the machine explodes. One register is just not enough for the volume of people in line and call in orders. I legit felt bad for the staff on the register as I could see the pure stress on their faces dealing with the amount of orders, people standing everywhere, asking for their togo orders, eye rolling frustrated people in line.   I typically don't mind waiting but it got to the point I'm standing there just dreading how soggy my sandwich was going to be once I finally got it. Which it was. Every single staff member was so friendly despite the anxiety behind that counter. My sandwich was pretty great still despite being a bit soggy. A second register is necessary, please for the sake of non soggy sandwiches and your employees!"}
{"text":"Time after time I'm seriously upset to give this place money. We love the sandwiches, that's never the issue, it's the lack of customer service. Went in today, and the guy was so concerned about his plans for the night, \"going out to the strip, drinking...\" that we had to slowly explain what we wanted on our sandwiches. I hope one day this location gets it together."}
{"text":"Awesome guys! Always fun and making jokes with us. Meat and cheese sliced fresh when you order and I love that I can customize my thickness. Great spot for a quick sandwich at lunchtime. Just sad they dont have black olives or sweet peppers."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Jersey Mikes, maybe I'm a little bias considering I'm from NJ. But, it's awesome to get a sub and have it remind me of home. With every bite it takes me back to my childhood having a sandwich sitting in the park! Well enough of memory lane.   I've been to this location just a few times, and they are nice never given me any problems. They smile which is awesome :)   My tip to you, get the number 8, mikes way! Please don't get it any other way don't add anything else just keep it as is lol ! Enjoy manja"}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here to get three philly cheese steaks all the same except add extra jalapeno on one. We get our sandwiches and go home to see that they didn't mark which sandwich had extra jalapeno on it...and we were the only people in the whole store."}
{"text":"They messed up the bread for my order and the order ahead of me. So they just dump the innards of my sandwich onto some other bread."}
{"text":"The friendliest service I've ever had at a sub shop. The two young guys here went above and beyond to make our experience great. They also have free kid meals during summer which was awesome. Food was great and the staff took a lot of care to keep everything clean."}
{"text":"#6 is by far the most amazing sandwich ever. Since moving from California we have tried other \"Sub\" chains....I'm definitely done searching. A must add is the Vinegarette sauce, that's the kicker to making this sandwich, #6, the BEST Sandwich EVER !!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here almost every week. The last few times I've been in here though there has been a black girl working and she always talks to the employees rude and condescending.  She even talked to me rude and I did not appreciate it! I think I'll start going to a different location as long as she is there!"}
{"text":"The staff was really nice and kept the line moving during the lunch time traffic. I had the philly cheese steak (like a fat boy) and it was awesome. Their rewards program is worth it. You just enter your phone number and they don't pester you with pointless texts. Every time I go there I receive a warm welcome and the staff is cool."}
{"text":"I had turkey, provolone, lettuce, tomato, mayo on wheat bread and it was excellent. Everything was fresh and made perfectly. The sub was wrapped well too.  Tip: if you get your sub to go and want oil and vinegar ask for it on the side so it doesn't soak through the sub."}
{"text":"We love this place, the food is good and they have great service.  We grabs sub a couple times a week."}
{"text":"Two word. BIG KAHANA  That's all you need to know if your looking for a very good cheese steak for a chain. Cooked to order. Good amount of meat, cheese, and toppings."}
{"text":"Brand new location on AZ and Ocotillo. I put in an online order for 3 kids meals and 2 adults to go.   1 Ham no cheese and dill pickle. No other toppings 1 Turkey nothing on it with white bread. No other toppings 1 Turkey with white bread and cheese. No other toppings  1 Tuna Mikes way 1 club No Oil, Red Wine, add Mayo and Mustard, Keep Lettuce and Tomato  Order put in at 6:12PM for pickup at 6:45 Wife arrives and waits 4 minutes before someone acknowledges her. They then say they messed up the order and will have to redo it. OK that's fine. I would prefer to get it right than arrive at home with the wrong order. Although they made sure to help everyone else in line first before starting to 'remake' our order. I wonder if they messed up or just didn't do it.   What we got by 7:15 was 3 kid meals Mike's way. Try telling young ones to pick off onions and deal with the oil. Plus the club sandwich showed up Mike's way as well.   Not a very good opening for this team. I hope they get better. Spending 35 bucks on dinner and having to explain to children why there food was wrong was not a pleasing experience."}
{"text":"Large sandwiches even their smallest sandwich is quite large, stacked high with meat and cheese as it should be. Great prices too, friendly quick service. Excellent lunch"}
{"text":"The old staff was incredible. Now that they are under new management it is awful. It took over 10 minutes to get our food, simply due to extremely slow hands and socializing. I ordered the grilled veggie wrap, which was cold and falling apart. The manager was flirting with female customers. We asked the cashier what happened to all of the old employees and he replied \"guess they are SOL\". Which, lets be honest is just plain rude. The tables were dirty, there is a piece of roast beef next to me as I type this. I don't like to write bad reviews but I am very disappointed with the experience I had today."}
{"text":"Awesome subs, I'm from East PA an it reminds me of home! My fiancee got the cheese steak and it's legit!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Jersey Mike's, but I always forget about it.  Well after hearing about their \"Month of Caring\" and taking a day's profits from everyone of their stores and giving it to charity, I knew I had to try them.  And it was fantastic.  I love the fact they slice the meat and cheese fresh instead of it being pre-sliced in a bin.  The bread was soft, but not too soft and it was fresh too.  They have plenty of help to take care of you promptly. They make your sandwich to order and all the veggies were fresh and it tasted fantastic.  The service was very good and very friendly.  They were very busy, so I disregarded the fact that the dining room needed some attention, but the food and service were top notch.  I look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"I was so happy when I moved to the West Side of Vegas, that this place is within a couple of miles of my house, and I've gone in there about once a week (at least) since.  The GM or owner is always very nice to the customers and staff (at least in front of the customers).  And the staff is also very friendly and helpful.  The ingredients and the breads always taste fresh and of the highest quality.  Their roast beef is by far the best I've ever had.  I want to try something else, but I can't.  It's just so good.  They keep a very clean store as well.  If you're looking for a drawback, it's the parking lot.  It is in a very busy strip center and at peak times, good luck finding a spot.  But when you do, it's well worth it.  Only wish they were open 24 hours or at least until midnight, so I could grab a sandwich on the way to work each night.  :)"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Jersey mikes, but this location specifically is so unimpressive. I can't even believe there has been more than one occasion where I've walked in, been the only costumer in the place, seen at least three employees on the clock, and it's taken several minutes to be helped. It takes me more time to get out of there than going to the always busy location on Scottsdale and the 202. I was really excited to have a closer location open, but I'll have to keep going to the other location where the management seems to actually emphasize the importance of customer service."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and great subs. I love the mini Italian on white. Has the wheat and it was pretty good too. Fresh sliced and have it Mike's way which is onion lettuce tomato vinegar and oil ... I get extra oil. Hold the oregano and salt and add black pepper for Jeff's way sub."}
{"text":"Walked around the Las Vegas airport for a while and Mike's Subs seemed like the most reasonable option.   There's a large variety of cold and hot subs; with a choice of wheat bread or on a white roll. It's about $11 per sandwich and they are only on six\" rolls, so it gets to be a little pricey, but it was worth it. I was craving a dirty, greasy philly cheese steak sub and that's exactly what I ended up getting.  Grilled peppers, onions, steak and melted cheese served \"Mike's Way\" (oil, spices, wine dressing and no mayo) were delicious and just under 800 calories (I was craving a heavier meal since I was pretty hungry). A bit of a messy meal and no seats (take out only) make this meal a bit challenging to consume, but no real problems.  Totally enjoyed it and the employees here put a huge smile on my face :). I'll be flying back through Las Vegas next week and they may get a repeat customer already ;)."}
{"text":"The subs are fresh and delicious. Also the customer service was super kind and helpful. They were 3 girls who helped me through the menu and even gave me a free cookie because it was my first time there.  My sub was so tasty, I recommend getting it, \"Mike's way.\" The meat, the cheese, the veggies and the sauce was really well balanced too."}
{"text":"Best sandwich spot in phx ...the staff is friendly but you better have your order ready they move the line fast"}
{"text":"Super fast and friendly. I love this location! We got 2 hot subs during lunch hour and they were ready in a few minutes."}
{"text":"Pretty good sub. Regular size is a decent size sandwhich. Good enough for lunch.   I ordered the Club Supreme. Turkey and roast beef with bacon. The bacon was crispy and that's a plus. Ordered it Mikes Way without tomato or onion. So it had lettuce, mayo, oil and vinegar, seasoning, and salt. I added pickle and banana peppers.   They put on a lot of oil and vinegar so beware if you aren't the biggest fan. They slice the meat and cheese when you order so that's nice.   Overall it was a good sandwhich. Will probably come back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Jersey Mikes Subs a few times... usually this location and I always find the subs lacking flavor. On top of that the prices are more expensive than Jimmy Johns, and I think JJs has better subs all around."}
{"text":"By Far My Favorite Sub Sandwich. I was so Happy to see Jersey Mikes New Location right here in East Mesa on Baseline just East of Signal Butte. The Bread is Great and the Quality Meats & Cheeses are Generous Portions.  I always ask for Mikes Way which makes for a Most Delicious Super Sub. Great Service with Lot's of Welcoming Smiles makes me Glad I Stopped in for Lunch. You Can Count Me in as a Regular Customer !!!"}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, but awesome selection, great service. I got absolutely no sleep last night and it showed. Massive dark circles under my eyes. The lady who rang me up at the register said, \"Oh my! Get some sleep! You can't come back here looking like this, you poor thing!\"  She reminded me of a sweet old grandma! As I was walking out with my sandwich, she said \"Remember what I said!!!\" She had me laughing. Super nice people working here. Service with a smile, definitely choosing this over subway, 100%."}
{"text":"If I could give this location a negative star rating I would. Every time I have been here has been worse than the prior visits. This time I only came back to redeem a free sub coupon that I was given on a prior visit when I informed them that they gave me $10 to much when they counted my change back to me. So I ordered my sub which I had to do three times because the person taking my order couldn't remember anything. Then when I went to the register they refused to accept the coupon they gave me saying they no longer accept those even though there was not printed expiration date but said they would give me $3 off instead. After they couldn't figure how to ring it up I was told they were just not going to accept it and I would have to pay full price. The young man ringing me up had a huge attitude and was a prime example why the minimum wage shouldn't be raised. To cap off this horrible experience when I got home both of the sandwiches were made wrong. STAY AWAY from this location if not all of them which is what I am going to do"}
{"text":"This is a brand new location, we had some great BOGO coupons!!! Friendly fast service, clean and yummy quick sandwich if your on the run or need a quick lunch or dinner! This will definitely be a spot we will hit often after a busy weekday or a quick date night munch!!!"}
{"text":"Usually I have no complaints with jersey mikes subs in chardon, but when I spend 12.45 for a Philly cheesesteak and get chicken instead I am a little upset, especially when I order no jalapeños and get a mouthful the first bite, honest mistake right? Store wasn't much help, they told me I need to bring it back in so they can see it, sorry it's in.my trash, here is a tip, avoid this place at all cost"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for quite a while. I used to live close by, but now take the long way home from work to grab a sub. I live closer to the new Bridgeville location, but the quality is way better at this one. The owner is present more often than not, and a while ago, even offered to let me in before they open so I could get a breakfast sandwich and still be on time for work (not sure if they still have those). Always very fresh ingredients. I have never had a bad experience at this location with quality of service. Worth the higher price tag."}
{"text":"This team was great! The food is great! The manager Mike Wood always takes care of our large family and makes sure all our wants are met. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I looove sammiches and Jersey Mike's does a great job of making some good ones.  Located right next to Firefly, JM serves up some great sandwiches in their own way. Jersey has either cold or hot subs, and everything is cut and sliced fresh in front you like like Port of Subs. They don't have baked subs but they do have a grill for their phillys.  I came in and ordered the Club supreme or whatever they call it... The sandwich was great, they sliced a ton of meat on to it, the toppings were perfect and the bacon was suuuuper crispy. On top of that, the service was great! People who work here were real nice. The friends I came with had a the Chicken Parm hot sandwich, though it sounded good, it came out to a hot mess literally.  They def get points for offering a UNLV discount, but beware showing up at lunch time! They can get packed."}
{"text":"Always great! Big Kahuna! Cold cut sandwiches are always top shelf! Go eat and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this location today for dinner while in town. Not busy yet as it was an early dinner for me. Service was good. They greeted me as soon as I walked in the door. I'm a frequent JM customer and the food here was good, which is consistent with other locations I've been to. Store was clean. It's five minutes away from where I usually stay, so I'll be back on return trips when in the area."}
{"text":"Yelp to the hunger rescue!    I was at target last night, and wanted to grab something for dinner.  I didn't want it to take long, and I really wanted to get home.  So is searched yelp, and Jersey Mike's popped up!  I always forget about this place because it's around the corner from everything else.    This was my first time here.  The staff was really friendly and nice.  I walked up to the counter and the roast beef sandwich caught my eye.  I asked the kid behind the counter if it was really \"the best there is\" (as advertised) and he showed me the chunk of meat that he'd be slicing from (perfectly cooked) and said \"yeah, it's pretty good.\"  So I went with the roast beef and was taking pictures for my yelp post.  The cashier asked if I took a picture of the menu, and I said yes - he then posed for his own picture!  Haha.  The prices are more expensive than subway, and there are less topping choices.  But they have very friendly, quick service.  The roast beef was very good too - not the \"best there is\" but I'll be back for it again.  Chips and drink are included in the meal."}
{"text":"New to Vegas. Had a great experience here with the staff. Jamarcus and his crew were exceptionally pleasant and made my sandwich with love."}
{"text":"Skyla, a manager at this location, has great customer service! She is willing to go above and beyond to make sure her customers are satisfied. With a manager like her, this location is set for success!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Fresh and fast! Friendly staff and clean place to eat. The prices are good. Best subs in Cle!!!"}
{"text":"We were heading home from Vegas and needed something to eat before we board our plan.  After walking around the airport, we settled for this place.  My husband and I, both ordered a sandwich.  Prices were about $9 each (there was only one size).  I do like the sandwich but the bread tasted stale."}
{"text":"Decent subs for a fair price. Jersey Mike's Subs is a good place to stop when you want something light but don't want a salad (though if you want a salad they have those, too).  It's not amazingly mind-blowing or anything but it's a perfectly good sub, enjoyable and tasty. Stop by here and then stop next door for some frozen yogurt; that's a great summer combo."}
{"text":"My sandwich was great, the ladies behind the counter were full of energy and contagious happiness."}
{"text":"This is quite the convenient location for me now thanks to a new job. Whenever I'm craving a sub, Jersey Mike's is always my answer. This location happens to be tucked into the Best Buy shopping center that's located right across from Northlake Mall. I had no idea about this location until I got said new job last month.  Each time I've been here (on different days and weeks), I've seen the same employees who are extremely kind and friendly.  They're all extremely efficient (which is very much valued during the lunch rush) and make sure that you are satisfied with your sub/meal.  Nice, clean location (although on the smaller side when it comes to inside seating) with an outside patio."}
{"text":"I'm a big Jersey Mike's Subs fan and this location is excellent. The staff is very friendly and always do a great job putting together subs quickly."}
{"text":"Hot Sandwiches are awesome.....cold sandwiches just average. I highly recommend the Chicken Cheese Steak......peppers....onions....chipotle mayo....mmmmmmmmmm....real good. The Service could be better....but all in all not a total loss. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Just basically threw the sub together to get us out the door."}
{"text":"Excellent!  I got the Big Kahuna and it reminded me of a cheesesteak in Philly.  My wife got the meatball sub and also enjoyed it.  I plan on making this a weekly purchase.  Owner was there and was very personable.  Great experience."}
{"text":"I've now been here a couple times and have tried the Chicken Salsa wrap (which is disgusting, and shouldn't even be on the menu for being a boring item) and their Chipotle Cheese steak (which has been amazing at times and horrible at times). The cookies they have however, have been phenomenal each time, though they definitely need to be bigger.  The staff has always been awesome.  All in all, I recommend this place, but there needs to be more consistency in taste."}
{"text":"Great subs. Consistently really good.   Always friendly and fast service. Fast food chain ambiance could be improved but it's not a big deal.  Recommended."}
{"text":"A great experience each time I come in. The employees are friendly and the food is awesome."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and walked out cause no one would help me. I waited for 10 minutes no one helped me or even asked. I was trying to buy 6 subs I guess they don't need my business. Very poor management at this location. The one on hell and Tatum and Arrowhead Mall they actually care about the customers and the service. I wouldn't be surprised if this location doesn't make it. It's a shame cause the image of the company is positive except this location."}
{"text":"Clean! The girl grabbing my order was young (didn't get her name), attentive and very sweet. I appreciate all the double checks on my order. They were quick and generous. I forgot to mention the younger guy. He asked how my day was and I said well it would be better if I didn't have strep (I know I'm sick) and he offered for me have a drink of water no options. Lol I thought that was sweet. They were talking about opening their own business and hiring one another lol that's great to have people you enjoy to work with you. I'm very pleased with this service."}
{"text":"Lunch before flight. I ordered the tuna salad on wheat. The bread seemed a little stale and the sandwich was bland, even with jalapeños and pepperoncinis. But it may just be personal preference. I like tuna salad to be made with more than just mayonnaise."}
{"text":"really good sandwich but they need to do in Las Vegas you need to have hours that are open laterthis is a24 hour town"}
{"text":"Couple of harsh reviews but I've been nothing but happy with Jersey Mike's.  I've never seen or heard of other locations but this one opened down the road and after trying it out, I've returned about 15 times now and will continue to do so.  It's NOT like subway at all actually...  I have always had great sandwiches from here and have always had a lot of meat stuffed in, to the point to where a big sandwich basically makes 2 meals for me.  The stuff is always fresh and tastes super good so, no problems there.  I will give a word to the wise tho... Although it's very good... \"Mikes Way\" has them put a bunch of oil & vinegar on and if you plan on keeping half for dinner or next day be careful w/ mikes way as it'll saturate the bread over time.  Mikes Way eaten right away is the bomb tho... loves it.  Just heads up.  I will say they do take some time to make the food, and lunch time can get pretty busy and lengthy so they'll want to work on that.  But they slice the meat for every sandwich and it seems that may be part of the backup.  I've gone in there at night to pickup food on the way home and it didn't seem to take as long.  Pricey?  Eh... I'm not saying that... I think they're very competitive and I've never thought that the times I've been there.  Not as much as Capriotti's but not as cheap as Subway... but subway sucks so lol...   Good small patio for nice days to eat outside... good amount of inside seating but again gets busy at lunch (cause it's good) and the one downside is they only have Pepsi products.... fail... I like Coke :/"}
{"text":"Service was crazy slow with an attitude. I kind of enjoy a hint of distain from the person taking my money. This is not always the case but tonight it was a Sh*t show. And the one consistent thing about this place is if you order it Mikes way, be careful. Mike apparently loves his Sammy drowning in oil. I do want oil, but a drizzle, not a down pour. By the time I get home with it, the paper is clear and the whole outside of the bread has a slick coat of oil. Use two hands or it could slip on the floor. Although my face is begging for that as not to mar up my pretty face with zits...     from all the oil of coarse."}
{"text":"It just grosses me out that they cut the bread right on the counter. Doesn't seem sanitary even if they do wipe the counters, I don't see them do it so all I can do is assume the worst."}
{"text":"Lots of choices and flavor. I got a turkey sandwich mikes way! Nice service! I crave it often!"}
{"text":"Yummy Philly steak and cheese subs. Nice staff. Pricey though. But I can't help it.  Sometimes I gotta have it!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop here last weekend for a quick lunch while out running errands.....The staff was quite friendly. Everything was made to order, which I enjoyed. My sandwich had a few too many peppers on it, but was really tasty otherwise.  I will more than likely go back and try a different sandwich. It was a little pricey for what it was. I almost feel like they should have a \"meal\" with chips & a drink like other sandwich shops have. I also feel like they should have different size sandwiches instead of length of hoagie bun. My mother in law got a build your own wrap.....and decided to get relish on it.....and they failed to tell her it was a spicy relish. She wasn't very happy about that."}
{"text":"YUM! This was my first time eating at Jersey Mike's and it was yum yum in my tum. I had the Philly Cheesesteak with mushrooms added. I'm also glad they offer Vickie's chips :) The two guys working were very nice and I'm happy that this is down the road from my new place!"}
{"text":"Super yummy Sandwich Spot the service was amazing first time in there the girl behind the counter had lots of suggestions had an Italian sub and a pastrami sub great neighborhood spot to get a quick bite"}
{"text":"I love this place. I eat here for lunch on work days frequently. I also place online orders for pick up after work to take home for dinner. Pay online and tell then lm when I want it. Then I just run in and pick it up. So easy. The staff is friendly. It is clean. In a good location and easy to park. Nice outside dining avaliable."}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly staff. Bread is always fresh and the meats and cheeses are excellent quality. 100 times betrer than Subway. Clean location to dine in if you choose.  Join their sub club to earn free sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  The bread is nice and soft, meat delicious, fresh toppings.  They slice the meat fresh right before you eyes for your sandwich.  It's actually fun.  The employees are fun and friendly. If you ask to sample something they will gladly cut you a slice. I like to try all the sandwiches and haven't been disappointed yet.  I usually get a regular with everything on it and save half for lunch the next day.  Sometimes the line is long, but they are very efficient in servicing the customers."}
{"text":"This is one of the best managed Jersey Mikes I have ever been too. I have been eating here consistently for 8 years (since 2006)  and they never disappoint. Always clean, and always fresh and consistently tasty sandwiches. The line can get long, especially on Tuesdays when they have specials, but it moves pretty fast and the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This location needs management help, bad.   We love the #6 roast beef sandwich that's a little rare. At this location the roast beef has never been rare and today the employee refused to add more meat without charging me extra. The meat hardly covered the bread so he just moved the meat around so I would stop complaining. He was rude to me and the customer behind me about the same thing on a different sandwich type. They seem more concerned about keeping costs down than making a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch for take out. Their sandwiches were ok, nothing crazy or nothing bad. I got the ham and my brother wanted the cheese steak but they gave him the wrong order. Although my sandwich looked okay,  his looked like it needed more meat. I like how they seasoned it with oregano. They were priced starting at $6."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food but 1 star for the customer service. I have been in here several times and I have to say I feel very uncomfortable with the fact that no females work at this location. The all male staff that I experience every visit makes for a uncomfortable visit. They aren't friendly, never crack a smile or even ask how are you? There is one gentleman in particular that is working every time I'm there that needs to work on his customer service (not sure of his name). He seems like the lead guy there. Last time I was in I asked how he was and his reply was \"I'm here\". I don't understand why people work in the customer service industry and yet provide no customer service. I want to return and enjoy a sandwich here but I'm uncomfortable doing so."}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner? Chipotle Cheese Steak sub! First time here and I really have nothing bad to say about the place. I liked the flavors and any extra juice was soaked up by the soft bread, but not so much that it fell apart. I took one bite and couldn't stop until it was quickly eaten up! Only thing I don't understand is how they are a sandwich shop and don't have cheddar cheese? Regardless, I would eat here again. Bill came to $8 with a bag of kettle cooked jalapeno cheddar chips mmm."}
{"text":"Never wanted to try this place because I knew I wont get the food I want for a good price. Seen so many ads so I decided to try it out. Went with their famous cheese steak. Reg sub price is 7.50. Got charged 8.50. Size is less than 6 inches...id rather go to harris teeter and get their 12 inch giant sub with unlimited toppings for 5$...  EDIT: i finished eating the sub...it was damn good so I give it 5 stars for food but 1 star for pricing."}
{"text":"You've really got to be a gigantic, spiritually motivated porkafied fanatic to frequent this joint. As you open the doors to the place, pork bombs explode all over you. Your left with the scent of southern, cured and fried porkiness in your clothes for hours.   Did I mention that I'm not of fan... Well I'm Not but I'm prayerful that many have been motivated to visit Jersey Mike's. The location is uber clean and the service is on par.  Thanks! ... but no thanks for me."}
{"text":"It's fast and easy order online pick up when driving home. Can't go wrong with that and the food is good almost reminds me of being back in Philly."}
{"text":"I enjoy Jersey Mike's and make it one of my regular stops.  I especially enjoy the Chipotle Cheese Steak Sandwich.  Consistent and fresh!"}
{"text":"I'm satisfied to know there is another place to eat in Laveen since all the food options are pretty slim! First time in staff was able to point me in the right direction and I am a satisfied customer...ended up with the Chicken Philly and couldn't be happier. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Got to this location before lunch rush there was literally one person in front of me that ordered a cold sub. I placed my order for a hot wrap lets fast forward to about 20 mins later when i finally get my wrap. The wrap was  missing the items i requested pickles ect... annoying but no biggie I can still eat it as is. As a take my first bite the wrap is completely cold which makes no sense and the chicken felt weird so I spit it out to find that the chicken was not cooked through properly. I tried calling the restaurant four times about 10 mins after I left and no answer. How is it possible to take 20mins on a hot wrap to receive it cold and it not be cooked through?? I am currently pregnant so being give meat that wasn't cooked is huge! I will never go back to this location. WASTE of $10 bucks!!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes Italian sub is always good but the servers often give the place a bad name. Slow to take your order and even slower to make it. Someone needs to tell the servers that a smile and positive attitude go a long way."}
{"text":"Online ordering here is the way to go: skip the line, easy and correct. I do really love that their employees get the on-line orders, even the complicated ones, right each time. As far as customer service goes, they get an A from my family. When you do order online, their system allows you to choose toppings and then also provide specific instructions, if needed; i.e.: light on mayo, extra jalapeño, add black pepper, etc etc.... and I'm pleasantly surprised that their employees actually pay attention to all those little details.  As far as the sandwiches, when the bread is good, it is a decent sandwich. I prefer the crust crisp and the dough light and airy, but it's a mixed bag and, at times, we've found the bread didn't have that fresh taste and feel. I have started asking them to go LIGHT on the vinegar and skipping the EVOO though because we were finding the bottom side completely mush by the time we got those sammies home. No bueno.  Their meats are pretty plain in flavor on the cold cuts (usually get a turkey club or some other turkey/cappacuolo variety; hubby likes their roast beef, but again, I find it plain) I typically order every topping to give it some zing and flavor, and then it's pretty good, although nothing one can't make better at home. It's all about the convenience here!"}
{"text":"Love Jersey Mike's. The sandwiches are nothing fancy, but the freshness is what makes the quality. I always go with a turkey provolone with their signature chipotle sauce. The staff here is very friendly... maybe even a little flirty... free drink! :-)"}
{"text":"The sandwiches at Jersey Mike's are always good but at this location they were just okay. When I went in tonight they were out of white bread all together and they had no bacon either. My sandwich had bacon but they didn't ask if I wanted anything else on it, they were just going to let it slide. Luckily I heard the guy in front of me having the same problem. Also even though it was more than an hour before they closed they blocked off the whole seating section so nobody else could sit. Not very good customer service here at all! To update, both my wife and I became violent rlly sick overnight and this was the only food we ate that was the same. I knew something didn't taste right when eating this...This will cost us over $500+ just in staying home from work now. Thanks a lot Jersey Mike's!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the cheesesteak here but that is not why I am writing the review. We had the pleasure of our sandwiches being prepared by Rueben.  Rueben delivered some of the friendliest and most professional customer service I have ever experienced anywhere and I really hope Jersey Mike's takes the time to recognize this gentleman for his qualities."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten at a Jersey Mike's since I was in high school.  Now I realize what I have been missing.  Got an Italian hoagie, and was thoroughly impressed.  Very fresh tasting, although the sandwich could've used just a little more meat, IMO.  I would choose Jersey Mike's over Subway every time, though."}
{"text":"Just before my flight back INDY Me and my lady decided to get sandwich from jersey Mike, what a mistake. The line was long, I had no problem with that cause we are at the airport. The problem i had is I ordered 2 sandwiches and as we were waiting for them a group of six people got  there food before us. I'm like WTF THE sandwiches were sitting right next to the register the whole time while the six people went through the line SMH.   This was Ridiculous and unacceptable, so I spoke to the worker there excuse was NO BIG. What a terrible thing to say very poor management, then you wanna charge me 22 dollars for 2 sandwiches along with the bad service SMH."}
{"text":"This Jersey Mike's location, specifically, is the reason that I will return to the franchise. I used to go all the time in college but stopped once I began cooking for myself. Now, I will return many times, when I want a tasty sub with quality service. Javaughn stood out to me because he did not give me the same cookie cutter response most people would give. He actually wanted to know my name and have a conversation! This kind of interaction is dwindling in today's service industry so I commend him for that."}
{"text":"The restaurant's Apple Pay device doesn't work. The employees know about it and management doesn't do anything to fix it. I have eaten there at least twice in the last couple of weeks and every time I tried to Apple Pay it doesn't work. If they are not going to do anything to fix it why have the device and advertise that they have that feature?"}
{"text":"Went in on Sunday, service was quick, friendly, and the food was great! Good alternative to subway."}
{"text":"My dad and I went here yesterday, as we heard a lot of Jersey Mikes are very good. The decor is fine, although it is hard to see the menu unless you're almost first in line. I got a tuna on wheat with cheese and lettuce, which was surprisingly tasty. It came with chips (I got SunChips Garden Salsa), a drink, and a cookie if you donated $0.50 to charity. That was a very nice touch, and several people did donate. The cookie was decent, it was a David's cookie. Location is very good (Stonecrest), and service was personal and done with a smile. I would come back again."}
{"text":"So I ordered an Italian sub from here and half of the sandwiched tasted completely different from the first 1/2 and my boyfriends sandwich was not made well at all."}
{"text":"We love Jersey Mike's!! The Italian was not quite the same without the cherry pepper relish, which they were out of nationwide! But it is still really a great place! The staff is super nice and friendly and even though there's a long line they keep up with the orders.  Hopefully they get that cherry pepper relish thing taken care of soon so that I can have it back on my favorite sandwich!"}
{"text":"Well, it looks exactly like every other Jersey Mike's inside, and that includes being very clean. The staff were very friendly and talkative. And the sub, the Original Italian, was good as always. Overall, a nice first impression for this brand new location. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Dreadful sandwich .I tried the Chipotle Cheesesteak , the worst sub sandwich ever !!! First the guy cut the bread on a weird angle not even close to being the center.He put in almost NO meat,you could get more meat on White Castle sandwich ! The bread was stale but granted  it was near closing time. The price of their sandwiches are not cheap.This is the second time I have eaten here,last time I was not impressed but tonight it gets zero stars.There is a bunch of young kids working here and they don't seem to care much about making a good sandwich.I will never go back.I have not been to another Jersey Mikes but if the rest are as bad as this they will go out of business. Jimmy Johns are ten times better,they know how to make a good sub !!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here yesterday to get 3 steak subs. When my son bite into his sandwich 2 black bugs came crawling out to great him he dropped his sandwich and threw it away. I called the store and asked to speak to the manager and first they said he was gone then after telling my story someone came on the line pretending to have a deeper voice and said that must have happened on the way home. If you eat there you know they wrap their sandwiches super tight so there is no way anything on the outside can get in. I think this location needs to be evaluated by the food administration on something because it is very unclean. The manager (pretender) was not even sorry."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for Buy 2 Giants, get 1 free.  Called in for pickup.  Ordered a chicken cheese steak, a chicken parm, and a roast beef and provolone.  Got home to find I got a chicken parm and 2 chicken cheese steaks.  Receipt had the order right, subs in the bag were wrong.  First the parm:  No discernible breading on the chicken at all, partly because the sub was doused in sauce.  Drowned in sauce.  Just a mess of a sandwich.    The cheese steaks:  Filling was fine, but (and this is my biggest criticism for both the cheese steak and the parm), the bread.  A sub is only as good as the bread.  This bread was a doughy, mushy mess.  A real sub roll has a browned, slightly crunchy crust on the outside and a fluffy center.  This bread is pretty much a step above Wonder Bread.  No bite, no texture, no flavor.  After the first half a sandwich, I stuck the rest of them into a 400 degree oven unwrapped.  It toasted up the outside of the bread a bit and made it tolerable.  Still, learn how to bake bread or outsource it from someone who knows what they're doing.  If you want a good sub, find an independent shop.  If you absolutely have to have a chain sub, go to Capriotti's.    This place, Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Big fan of Jersey Mike's. Don't think I've ever had a bad sub there."}
{"text":"I don't know what the deal is this THIS Jersey Mike's. Every location I've been to seems to have the fundamentals down but this is one a regret each time.   Today marked the third visit we'd had problems at this Jersey Mikes. After online ordering two sandwiches, I pick up our order and realize the bacon for our club is in a separate container. I thought it was usual but figured they had to wait for the bacon or something and decided to just get the sandwich off the line and add the bacon later. But, of course, I get home to a dry club that is void of either the mayo or oil topping (both of which were part of our order) on the smallest regular I have ever seen in my life.   The times before this I've had my online order completely switched (I'm guessing they just mixed up the bags so, I don't know, shame on me for not opening everything up before leaving) and, when my wife ordered a cheesesteak, ended up with a quite rare product that they agreed to put back on the grill to correct-- but, upon return, came with a snide little remark that Philly cheesesteaks \"just come like that\". Look man, I get things happen but you're really going to sit here and act like the standard for a cheesesteak is a light sear with that much pink.  It's frustrating to have such a outlier be our nearest Jersey Mikes (I don't know who the genius at corporate was who decided to let the Uptown location close, that one did everything right and always seemed busy) but the non-apology apology after the cheesesteak incident should have been all the warning I needed so, as goes the old saying in Tennessee -- I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee -- that says, fool me once, shame on -- shame on you. Fool me -- you can't get fooled again.  So, all said, just make sure you're checking EVERYTHING and your experience at this Jersey Mikes should be fine."}
{"text":"Not my favorite J Mikes here. I've been a few times and I always leave feeling like, \"that didn't seem right.\" Sometimes it's a long wait. Oftentimes in seems to be the employees being a little 'light' on the ingredients (lettuce or onions most often). I don't know -- being a franchise, it's weird to think, \"well the one on Camelback is so much better,\" -- but it really is.   I don't know, this J Mikes just needs to tighten things up and then it will be with the rest of the locations I have visited. It's typically clean, the employees are friendly enough -- it just needs that bump."}
{"text":"Yes people -- FREE COOKIE for checking in on Yelp. You don't have to dine in. Don't have to buy a combo. Don't have to toss in a business card. Just check in and get your cookie.  That said, Jenny loves Jersey Mikes and introduced me via this location. This one has been our J Mikes for a couple years now and I have only good things to say about it (considering it is, you know, a fast food sandwich joint). Good staff, clean store, don't skimp on the sub-making, and always ample parking."}
{"text":"Hands down beats subway and capriotti's. The subs were amazing and the staff was even better."}
{"text":"A whole wheat mini #7, please. Hold the cheese. With spicy mustard, lettuce, tomato and jalapeño. That's about 410 calories and makes me oh, so happy after a workout at the gym.   I love that they slice your meat for you when you order it and all of the toppings are really fresh. I also like that it's a pretty simple set up. There's something like 15 sandwich options, with some hot, some wrapped and others on subs. You can also have a sandwich in a dish if you're gluten free.   I'm a big fan. I also like the rewards program. You get points for every sandwich you purchase and eventually they earn you a free sammich! Heck yeah!"}
{"text":"Fresh and clean and high quality service!! I love this place. I think this place,you can eat the freshest sub in town. Since I found here I never go back to subway or port sub!  Because, way different quality of service and taste from other.  Baecha and Raquel are so friendly smart, serious servers! Baecha, she remembers what we ordered last time!! We always enjoy there. Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"My sub got the job done. I settled on this place because, I wanted something filling but, not too greasy or anything like that. Having an upset stomach is the worst when traveling.   I'm not sure what the deal with the bread was but, I couldn't tell if it was stale or, just a little flaky because it was \"grilled\" after requesting my cold sandwich to be made a hot one."}
{"text":"It's a 1 and done for me here. You pay $20 for 2 subs and they can't even make them right. Turn around and look at the menu behind you if you don't know what meats come in a number 9. I'll be sticking to Firehouse"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Awsome staff!!! Very big portions and good!! We go twice a week!! There cookies are so delicious! !!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's employees are just cool. You walk in and they greet you like they know you. The food was good too. They slice the meat fresh and fix up you sub however you'd like. The cheese steak was pretty bangin'. Warning: The parking situation just sucks in this area. They have a small lot but it was jam packed."}
{"text":"Tried Jersey Mikes today and enjoyed a large tuna sub. The tuna was fresh, the bread had a nice soft crunch, and all added vegetables looked and tasted fresh. Overall, I would rank it as a five star sub. Why the 4 stars? Even though the sub was nice and large in size; the price ($14+) seemed a little high for what you were getting. I definitely would say the quality and size far surpasses Subway's Large Tuna but with their price around $8, I can't rationalize paying $6 more for Jersey Mike's.  Very tasty sub though!"}
{"text":"Holy vinegar!! Mine and my boyfriends sandwiches are SOAKED in vinegar!! I ordered the tuna sub and he ordered the #4 it was really really tough to taste anything else. Both our bread was getting soggy and really fast.   I'll try this place next time without vinegar or putting it on the side.  Yikes.  I will say the tuna salad from what I could taste tasted good and it looks fresh."}
{"text":"Love the Sub in a Tub! Efficient and courteous staff. Clean restaurant and fresh meats and veggies. The music is a little loud when trying to carry on a conversation with someone across the table (great station, though). Love coming here several times a week."}
{"text":"HIGHLY Recommend it. The price the pizza is a little high but the pizza is delicious and so were the wings and the Greek salad. The only thing that I would change is I would have them deliver farther up to the southwest part of the valley by the M."}
{"text":"This operation is our favorite sub shop back home because they use more fresh sliced meats we were not disappointed here in Phoenix.     Our three subs were made quickly and exactly as we requested. They used plenty of oil and vinegar just like the old school Hoagie shops in New Jersey.     The club was great and the tuna was outstanding. It is all about the freshest ingredients, they taste better."}
{"text":"Food was awesome as usual. Never a dry sandwich & food is fresh! The two guys working were polite and made our experience great! Never had a bad experience with the food or service at JM but the only thing I'd say is the sit down area could be a little bit cleaner. We came in at 1030 and tables were a bit messy had food on them so we basically just looked for a cleaner table. I understand it can get busy and sometimes the tables aren't cleaned fast enough. Not a big deal since the two guys were pleasant and food was delicious. We love eating here!"}
{"text":"My second Jersey Mike's #13 (Italian) and I have to say this is a very good sub! The Giant size is expensive but VERY big. I think the ideal size would be something in between Regular and Giant. This time I added some mayo and pickles and some extra red vinegar - which makes the sandwich simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Reuben since I've had mixed feelings with the cheese steaks. It was pretty good and the bread tasted fresh. Good customer service."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Jersey Mike's which earned me a free cookie (nice touch!). There's something authentic about Mike's subs. The bread is crusty, soft, and fresh like a bakery. And the meat is sliced to order - very deli-like. I tried the #13 (otherwise known as the original Italian) and I had it Mike's way (standard toppings) including a delicious vinegar drenching.   To this point Jimmy Johns had been my go-to sub place. But as much as I still love Jimmy Johns, Jersey Mike's seemed a little more homemade. Definitely a very nice change and an excellent first visit, including the fantastic and energetic service from the staff. Great first impression!!!"}
{"text":"This is what happens when totally incompetent people are tasked with running a sandwich shop. 7:45 PM and they are literally out of bread. Did I mention the part about being a sandwich shop? Believe it or not it's the second time in two weeks! Never again..."}
{"text":"I ordered the cold Italian sandwich on wheat. It was good. The only thing I would probably ask for a little less of or none at all of, is the oregano. Since you can choose to add that to the sandwich or leave it off altogether, I didn't deduct any stars. I got the buy one, get one deal for making an account on their website."}
{"text":"Had the worst meatball sub of my life just now. Tasted like straight tomato paste, had to throw away after one bite. Plus it was given to me partially cold with sauce everywhere, could barely pick it up. Would not recommend to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Basically all you need to order is the #8 mikes way. No if ands or buts. The staff there was really friendly and upbeat. They were a la to get through a busy lunch rush without a hiccup I will return for lunch again. Thank you"}
{"text":"I always get the club supreme. They make a good sandwich and it's really not too pricey. I try and get the red peppers and jalapeños. This time they forgot what mikes way is but that's ok it was still good. This store was clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Very tasty.  Everything was good.  I really like their bread.  For a chain sandwich shop, this is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Two of us went for lunch. I ordered a steak sandwich. My buddy who cant make up waited like 5 minutes to order and then ordered a sandwich. They made his sandwich and he paid. I was still waiting. I asked whats the holdup and it turned out they never made it. I watched the one guy put my stuff on the grill and the other guy scooped it up and and put it in the fridge. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Eaten at a couple other locations.  Consistent in quality.  The oil and seasoning combo really does it for me."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Always understaffed. Can't say anything positive about this location. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Came here a few minutes before closing and the staff treated me like I came in at noon. I love their subs, even though they're on the pricey side. I always get their mini subs because the regular size are good enough to share"}
{"text":"I always wonder how Subway stays in business when there's a Jersey Mike's or Firehouse in the same strip mall. Now I know.  We stopped by this location at 11:15 on a Tuesday morning and the place was filthy. We were the only customers, but every table is covered in napkins, onions, grease, and dried crud that's obviously been there since at least last night.  The sandwiches were average for a JM's, but it can't make up for how disgusting this place is. If you want to visit this location, get here quick before the health department can shut them down.  What a hole."}
{"text":"Well I have been told by many people that this was a good place for a good sub sandwich. NOT!! The guys behind the counter need better customer service experience for one. If a person like myself walked into my business and said this is my first time here my response would have been \" what kind of sandwich are you looking for or may I suggest one of our best sellers. But I never got that. I wanted a good roast beef and cheese sub and if the young man would have said can I interest you in maybe a philly cheese steak sandwich but with roast beef? I would understand why I would have been charged $15.51 for my sandwich but when you only have beef,cheese, lettuce, onion and tomatoes slices and get charged that much I will stay with my favorite place SUBWAY. Good luck."}
{"text":"This Jersey Mike's is by far my favorite! The staff is welcoming as well as the owner Gary. Whenever I don't know what to get. They never fail to satisfy me. I have a few favorite subs. One of them is the California Club. The bread is always fresh as well as the meat/cheese and toppings, as well as the guacamole. I also love the tuna they always make it fresh."}
{"text":"not bad but nothing exciting. guys behind the counter were really nice. very clean and restrooms were nice."}
{"text":"Eh. Pretty clean. Hardly any toppings to choose from. Expensive for what it is. Cookies are not very fresh. No desire to return."}
{"text":"Jake Ingram was a great sandwich artist! He accommodated me everything I asked for. The sandwich tasted great. I am defiantly coming back in the future. Great atmosphere and food! I recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Our go-to sandwich shop in Belmont now. Consistently good food, great service. Try the #9 in a tomato basil wrap for a real meat-lover's treat!"}
{"text":"Solid sandwiches, service is very questionable I called and ordered 30 minutes ahead during an off time 415 in the afternoon , I arrived to pick them up and they were not made. I asked what's the point of ordering ahead and instead of a verbal response I got a look like I had 7 heads. The sandwiches are good but the service eeehh"}
{"text":"I ordered sandwiches here for my office. Had I not been ordering for an entire office I would have walked out. The manager was beyond rude, he told me I was ordering too slow and needed to speed up. When I attempted to tell him I needed extra condiments on a sandwich he stated \" I don't care, I don't do extras\". Even when I told him this was my first time at the restaurant and wasn't familiar with the ordering process he told me \"liked to go fast\"  He was rushing me through the ordering process. Meanwhile, I was the only customer in line at the restaurant and he had 5 employees standing around behind him doing nothing. #winning  My jaw dropped when he told me he was the manager of the store. To the owner: If I owned this franchise I would remove this person not only as a manger but as an employee.This is the last person I would ever want representing my business. Zero customer service or tact. This was my first and last time at Jersey Mikes, which is too bad because all the sandwiches we ordered were great."}
{"text":"quality food, quality service, and the guy who served me, jake, was extremely polite, knew the menu, and was professional."}
{"text":"I've been obsessed with Jersey Mikes since I first found it in San Diego 4 years ago . Was so excited to see they built some in Vegas let alone up the street from me. this location is very clean , and the people who work here are very nice . Sandwiches are made fresh , the cut the meat right in front of you . If you like subway you'll love jersey mikes . You'll never want subway again lol !"}
{"text":"Very tasty for fast food sub, However; the guy making my sub was clearly upset about having to move off the cold line to make the hot sandwich. Shook his head, rolled his eyes etc. not a great first impression. Sort of like when Subway people have to make salads."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Ordered online to avoid the line as they advertise. More like order online if you want to be completely ignored. Arrived on time & went to the area designated for online pickup as instructed. 4 or 5 people working behind the counter. Not one acknowledged my presence. After watching the couple that came in BEHIND me place their order, getting my own cup, drink & chips I said out loud, \"This is absolutely ridiculous.\" Cashier finally looked at me. I said I'm picking up my online order. He gave me a blank look & yelled to a guy at the other end of the counter who said my order was ready. It had been sitting gathering dust & getting cold for 15 minutes. If you're going to take online orders then have someone monitoring them & looking for the patron picking it up. I added a tip when I placed the order. Wish I had not. Not one of these fools deserves one cent extra. At least Firehouse mumbles a greeting. Here they do their best at ignoring you. Food is decent. Service sucks giant troll toes."}
{"text":"We recently moved to a house that is very close to this location, which means this is the one we have to go to if we don't want to drive far. Luckily, the nasty smell seems to have been taken care of! The only complaint I have now is that there is a female worker that is there in the daytime a lot that is SO incredibly rude, I can't even believe it! Even my parents from out of town commented on it the last time we were there. We had gone to a different Jersey Mike's and my parents were so impressed and craved it the whole time they were visiting AZ. We ended up going again on their last day here, but went to this location. Bad idea! The food was meh, and the cranky girl made us feel like we were ruining her day for existing in her place of employment.   The service is a million times better at the Gilbert/202, Queen Creek/Alma School & Chandler/101 locations. We try to get our Jersey Mike's fix when we are over those directions, so we don't have to deal with the service here."}
{"text":"This is really a 4.5 star review. I love Jersey Mike's! When I walked in there were plenty of smiling faces and friendly employees. The taste of the food is important obviously, but customer service goes a long way and this location delivers when it comes to both of those things.  When looking at the menu board I was having the hardest time deciding what to order. So many of the subs were something that I would eat. The cool thing about that is, there will be something new I can try out when I go back, so I could end up with a few favorites to rotate between. They offer a \"Sub in a Tub\" for those of you who do not like your meat between bread. You can just pick any sandwich on the menu and they will make it the same way they would on a sandwich, but put it in a bowl minus bread for you. They have a variety of \"Wraps\" to choose from. The sandwich sizes are mini (4 1/2 inches), regular (7 1/2 inches), and giant (15 inches) and the bread options are wheat or white. The bread is baked fresh at each location.   One of the workers suggested \"The Original Italian\" since it was their most popular sub. It sounded delicious so hubby and I decided to split one of those. The giant for this sandwich was priced at $11.95 and then it jumped to $13.95 before tax with the addition of extra cheese. It had provolone, ham, prosciuttini, cappacuolo, salami and pepperoni. Jersey Mike's uses quality meats and slices it fresh right in front of you. I ordered it \"Mike's Way\" which means they add onions, lettuce, tomatoes, vinegar, oil and spices. The sandwich was very good! I will order this one in the future for sure. The flavors all melded so well together.  I was very impressed with the knowledge of the employees. The sandwiches on the menu that are numbers 43 and 56 have meaning. The number 43 is the football jersey of the CEO. Apparently he started working for Jersey Mike's (the original on the jersey shore) when he was a teen and ended up buying it later on and shaping it into what it is today. The number 56 is a nod to the year the first Jersey Mike's opened up.  They offer a \"Shore Points\" reward program. You can sign up and use a card or just give your phone number when ordering to accumulate points towards free sandwiches.   Parking can be very frustrating at this location. It is tight in this area so please just be careful.  You can also place your order online or by phone.  Catering is available and they have a few different options for that.  Sign up for the e-club to get discounts.  Be hungry and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I visited this establishment last week.  I was impressed with the cleanliness and the employees.  I will agree with the other posts the location is very small, very cramp.  I would suggest \"Take Out.\""}
{"text":"This Jersey Mike's in located in kind of a cramped shopping center. I've stopped by this location a couple times now and and am glad to have a decent place to grab a sandwich for lunch when in the area. The employees inside are nice. I don't always remember my Shore Points Card, which accumulates points with each of my purchases towards free food, so it's nice that I can just give my phone number and they can look it up easy that way. I don't know if this is the only location that does it because I haven't seen it at other locations, but currently they offer a daily lunch special from 11 am to 3 pm that costs $6.99 and gets you any regular sub and drink.   I like the \"Original Italian\" and \"Club Sub\" the best. Mike's way of course! The Italian has 6 different meats. I'd rather pay a couple dollars more to eat subs here rather than Port of Subs or Subway because the meats, breads and cheeses just taste better. They also had some \"Chocolate Chip Cookies\" which I never knew they had, so I got some and they are good!  You can place your order over the phone or online (you have the option to enter your shore rewards points online) for convenient pick-up."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service by all employees including manager. Sad as I have been to so many other locations with helpful, kind, and happy employees"}
{"text":"Right down the street from me, so convenient, but will no longer eat here. The 17 (Philly) is downright disgusting to me now. Has a \"cheapness\" to it that I can't quite explain, but I do know that I couldn't finish my sub today.   Had a discussion with an employee that got really awkward. I was trying to explain that I wanted light mayo on the sub IF it has mayo and she kept insisting that they could add it. What's confusing is that the philly seems like it has mayo on it, but I suppose it's just melted cheese. Again, though - cheap - it doesn't taste like typical provolone.   Honestly, grossed out by this place at this point. Line is annoying and service is way too slow. All young folks here and some are nice, but others, like the girl who took my order today, are annoying and rude-ish.   I've had the tuna here, as well - not bad. They really overload the sub with oil and vinegar if you get it \"Mike's Way\".  Will just make subs at home and get a better tasting meal and not have to deal with annoying hs kids."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Jersey Mike's Subs and it was Amazing!! Got the California Club with Turkey (cut fresh from a deli slicer), Bacon, Avocado, Mayo and Veggies....absolutely Delicious! They are new so there was 4 people helping me out. I will be back"}
{"text":"Best turkey provolone sammich in Vegas without a question. No one tops Jersey Mike's subs. If u know a better sandwich shop in town lmk... I'll wait"}
{"text":"Best sammiches in town hands down. Great service great subs. Extra pickles pleazze!! Oh and hella wet"}
{"text":"This place is in the \"C\" terminal of McCarran Airport. They pack the Sub so it's easy to take it on a plane. My sandwich was delicious. It had an abundance of meat and lots of toppings.  They certainly gave me my money's worth. They had a well trained staff that kept the long line moving at a nice steady pace."}
{"text":"Hot Fresh and delicious!   Been eating here for 2 months and haven't had a bad experience yet.  The staff are friendly and welcoming   Always clean and tidy   My favorite is the beef chipotle with onion and peppers"}
{"text":"My chicken cheese steak sandwich was an explosion of cheesy melty chicken in my mouth. The only downside is I could only take one bite at a time. Makes me wish I had 2 mouths... wait no I wish I had 3 so I could eat with 2 and tell everyone around me how good my sandwich was with the 3rd."}
{"text":"First time at this location. I was greeted upon entering and my sandwich, the #13, was made exactly as I ordered it and with a good portion of meat. I always get the dough out. Friendly and professional staff here."}
{"text":"$29 bucks for two small JM subs and two cokes. What is wrong with this place? I just paid $8 for a diet coke and a bottle of water. These are crackhead prices in here. At leadt they tasted good but im still hangry!!!"}
{"text":"Needed something quick and close by so Jersey Mike's it is.  I got the Italian and maybe because I am a fan of Jimmy Johns so this cannot hold a candle to Jimmy Johns.  The quality and service, everything is just OK."}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes has great subs so the food is fine. But this one could use a good cleaning. We went on a Sunday at 1:00. It wasn't crowded but it wasn't very clean. Staff was friendly & made our food quickly and just as we ordered it. Kids eat free on Sundays with purchase of a regular sub too."}
{"text":"Great to have a Jersey Mike's at Northlake! This location is great as it keeps you away from most of the mall chaos. It is on the Best Buy side of Northlake, right next to the Trek store. Everything is nice and new as this location just opened a couple weeks ago. I am impressed how busy this location already is, especially during the lunch hour. You would never know they have only been open a couple weeks; staff is quick and friendly. I ordered the chipotle cheesesteak (delicious) and it was ready by the time I reached the checkout. Big plus, since I am accustom to waiting a few minutes for hot subs at other locations. Looking forward to many more subs here!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the chipotle cheesesteak. Gooey cheese and chipotle mayo smother the steak, caramelized onions, and bell peppers. The peppers have a nice pickled flavor to them that cuts through the richness of the cheese and mayo. It's really the only sandwich I order at Jersey Mike's. Definitely not a diet-friendly sandwich.   I have tried a few of the cold subs, but I am not a fan. Their ham and turkey tastes and appears heavily processed with a lot of water added. The ham and turkey always come out soggy and just not appetizing. Stick with the roast beef.   Staff is always friendly and quick. Store is clean. Parking is easy. Give it a try for a lunch."}
{"text":"Can't beat an $11 Soggy Sandwich drenched in oil on Flaky Dry Bread!!! Maybe this will fly in Jersey, but not here. Wow, no more Jersey Mike's for me. Smh :("}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's has the best subs I have tasted in Charlotte! I am very particular about the meat I consume, and they serve good, quality meat. The service is fast, and the employees are friendly and patient. Been several times. They are a little pricey, but hey, you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Manager and staff here are awesome. The guy remembers everybody. Great customer service!   I have never had a bad sand which from this place, always spot on.   LISTEN TO ME NOW.....GET REAL CLOSE TO THE SCREEN.....  YOU MUST GET IT \"MIKES WAY\"....YOU HAVE TO....DO IT....NOW..."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's already makes great subs. But what sets this particular location apart is the staff. Every time I go in there, there is at least one employee who acts like making your sandwich or ringing you up is the best part of their day. I seriously leave the place happier than when I walked in. Parking can be pain especially during rushes but they move the line so circle the block a few times if you can't find a space right away or parallel park on Scott and walk up the street."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this location and the menu. The manager is often in the store and the one time I brought a friend and she did not like her sub, her remade it for her on the spot and she said it was fabulous. They handle big crowds easily, the space is clean and well thought out, the bread and meat is always fresh -- never that chipped, pressed stuff you get at like a Firehouse subs. I have had both hot and cold sandwiches and they do both fabulously. And I love the seasoning that is included when you order \"Mike's Way\" -- it is not something I would think I would love, but it is awesome on cold subs. On your first visit they give you a free cookie, which makes kids so happy! I think by keeping the menu classic and simple, they keep the quality high. Two things I do wish would change: I am not a fan of Pepsi, so I wish they would get new drinks and I think their chip selection is sort of odd, but I rarely order them, so that is a good thing."}
{"text":"I thought I would never stray from Jimmy John's but this place is way better.  Lots of choices subs, wraps and salads.  I had the tuna sub and it was awesome.  They use a good quality pickle that makes a ton of difference.  A little pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"The woman working was far from friendly, and the bread felt and tasted like it was 3 days old. Even with this place being just blocks from my house, I don't see myself going back. BLAH."}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mikes and I have to say this particular location is just special. Its the staff all the way around. Don't get me wrong the sandwiches are always amazing. All of the ingredients are super fresh far more so than any other sandwich shop I have been to thus far. The lettuce is always freshly chopped (I'm a lettuce freak trust me this is good stuff) the tomatoes are always ripe theres nothing worse that biting into your sandwich and having to go to war with a tomato that was so not ready to be eaten and I love that the meats and cheeses are cut right there just for your sandwich.  Its so simple too just a turkey sub is all I get with the regular toppings #7 I think it is. But the staff really does just put the icing on the cake. You walk in and everyone greets you not like in a welcome to moes kinda way which always makes me feel kinda weird I do not know why, but more like you just walked into your friends house kinda way.  They don't just greet you they ask how your day is and make jokes with you as they make you that perfect sandwich.   The place is also super clean they are quick to get you in and out but keep in mind they do get crazy busy for their lunch rush, however they do offer online/mobile ordering to get you in and out faster should you really be in a hurry. They also have a rewards club so you can get a free sub with a certain amount of points."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sandwich shop! Why?! Because they are amazing!! This is my first visit to one in Pennsylvania, and I wasn't disappointed at all! I always get the exact same thing, salami, white bread, provolone cheese and mikes way plus spicy mustard. I  noticed immediately how clean this place was and the friendly staff. I get what I always get a salami On white mines way. I will be back here when I go back to Bobby Rahal BMW:-)"}
{"text":"My sandwich was delicious (#5) but what impressed me the most was the awesomeness and superb customer service from Kyle!! Kyle took the time to ask every single customer if we were ok and if we needed anything. His attention to detail and friendliness is worth more then 5 stars. I made sure to let the manager know what a great job he was doing! Great smile Kyle and your cheerful attitude is outstanding! I will definitely visit this location from today's experience. Thank you Kyle I appreciated your service!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed to see how the workers here have no idea no do they care about hygiene.  Couldn't believe the sandwiches were placed on a dirty surface next to a filthy rag they use for wiping  other surfaces!!! They thought nothing of it when I mentioned it to the manager, he too could care less.   This place should be shut down!!!"}
{"text":"Just grinded on a classic sub! Fresh as next to Baja Fresh but so American! God Bless both of them!"}
{"text":"Better tasting than Port Of Subs, Subway and Blimpie. But lack the option of other breads like sourdough and Rye."}
{"text":"I have only been to this restaurant twice and I have to say that I am a fan. This place makes Subway look really bad! Not only is the staff here very friendly and good at their jobs but the food there is just delicious. I Love the fact that everything is cut fresh before your eyes instead of wondering how long its been sitting in this nasty tub out in the room temperature air. A big thumbs up."}
{"text":"I love the food and have had jersey mikes cater multiple company events but after tonight's experience, I wont be giving them my money again.   There were 2 employees female and male working. The young lady was nice and gave great service however the male who I presume was the manager on duty made an unnecessary comment.   While purchasing my $10 sub, I kindly asked if I could also get change for one of my $20 bills. The young lady saw no problem with it however the MOD felt it was necessary to yell out \"you need to check those\" to his employee from 15 feet away.   It feels great to have 6-8 other customers stare at me in the dining room as if I was about to pay with counterfeit money.   The service floor is no place to call out loyal, paying customers. If he was so worried about his employee checking customer money then he should have made sure to include it in the employee training."}
{"text":"We picked up take out tonight and we told the guy a bunch of times----no onions, no onions, no onions.  Guess what was all over my Sub in a Tub??? Onions :/  They made my sandwich toasted at first and then fixed it and made it untoasted (The #13)  Disappointing that they did not have a gluten free sub roll as their website states they carry.    Maybe because it's so new it will work the kinks out?  I hope!"}
{"text":"One of the best I've been too. The staff is super nice and polite, and the bread her is always soft! I really love that on Tuesday ANY regular sub combo is $6.99!!! I usually try something new and get my regular for later. I just hope the staff gets the recognition they deserve for working so hard to make excellent products and the service so great. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I first tried Jersey Mike's 3 years ago when I lived in Minnesota and have loved it since!  I don't like to eat a lot of bread, so the sub in a tub is perfect for me.  And Mike's Way is so tasty!  Simple, but really good.  This particular location has been great the two times I've been there.  I like that they have two turkey options.  The deli that I've had at other locations and the roasted turkey which I've never been given the option to get at other locations I've been to.  Anyway, if you've never tried Jersey Mike's before you should!  And this location would be a good one to try for the first time!"}
{"text":"First let me say that the staff was amazing. They were professional, friendly & very accommodating. I was there with 3 young kids, so the attitude of the staff makes a big difference. The food was great as always. The only thing needing improvement was cleanliness. The bathroom was dirty. The sink didn't drain. There was no changing station. Other than that, it was all good. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I would of gave them a 4 star, but the guy who was making my sandwich tried to reuse lettuce that fell off my sandwich as he was making It.  Other than that, it was ok."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chain sub shop! I might be partially bias because I'm originally from jersey however I have to give credit where it's due they know how to make a good sandwich!  The bread isn't too hard nor do they scrape all the dough out of it. Just enough to soak up the oils and vinegar. My favorite is the Original Italian, it comes with salami, pepperoni, cappacuolo, prosciutto and provolone cheese.  I always get it Mikes was which comes which comes with lettuce tomatoes onions mayo oil and vinegar salt and pepper.  They have combo meals which include a drink and chips. They also have breath hot subs including their hot pastrami, jersey mikes famous Philly and chicken Philly cheesesteaks. Check you local Jersey Mike's for daily specials."}
{"text":"I guess this location just opened up.  I got some mail with some coupons for the Henderson location so I went.  I searched in Google Maps and there was one closer to my house but it's apparently closed.  Anyway I went in and first off I had to wait for upwards of 10 minutes before someone took my order.  There were only 2 people in front of me in line and they only ordered 1 or 2 sandwiches.  I asked for the chicken club and the guy cutting the bread lost the upper half of the bread after putting meat and cheese on it, so he had to cut new bread for it.  Then it got to the next person.  I asked for bacon and the spice shaker only.  She picks up the mayo scoop and asks if I want mayo.  No, I told her again that I wanted bacon and the spices only.  She gets bacon and then after that starts putting on vinegar.  What the hell?  So I asked if they would remake it.  She starts slowly picking off meat and cheese and gives the bun back to the first guy.  I can't really tell if there is vinegar on the bun or anything but I am not going to take a chance so I just leave without getting my sandwich.  This is happening more and more lately to me in general.  I am very clear about what I want on my order, it's made incorrectly, then the staff thinks they can just pick the offending thing off.  THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.  If you douse a sandwich in vinegar, don't spend 30 seconds examining it and picking pieces off of it after I ask you to remake it.  I will never return here."}
{"text":"Fairly new to to trying out Jersey Mike's Subs and this location didn't disappoint at all.  My personal go to, and the first sandwich I've ever tried was the original Italian. It tastes amazing and it's so delicious and I feel like it's everything that an Italian sub SHOULD be! At Jersey Mike's, they slice the meat fresh to order for each sandwich.   The employees are very friendly. I may come here again. They have an iPhone app that you can order from so that your sandwich is ready to go when you arrive. The employees seem genuinely friendly. As I was reaching to grab one of the lady cookies in the basket by the cashier stand, the cashier said \"Hold up, boss...\" I pulled my hand back thinking I wasn't allowed to get the cookie but he proceeded to say \"We have fresh ones that just finished baking, let me get one for you.\"   Great service!"}
{"text":"New to the area so I stopped in tonight to get subs for the family. The two young ladies who were working were amazing. Very attentive, had no issues with my special requests and even explained the loyalty program to me. The girl with the glasses even tried distracting my son who was fussing while the other girl explained the program. Awesome experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just like I remember from my several visit in Jersey passing through on my way to North Carolina many years ago. Fresh fast and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This location is finally under new management and has been completely remodeled!!!   This location was horrible before but now it's soooooooo nice. The seating inside is much more comfortable too! Months ago it was a ghost town at lunch (the old manager/owner was a creep) and today it was slammed! The new manager, Samantha, is soooo nice and very welcoming! The vibe inside is so upbeat! AND they have brewed unsweetened iced tea now!! The sandwiches tasted a lot better too and the bread was much fresher!   The only suggestion I would make is to lower the music just a teensy bit. :)   SOOOOO happy to see such an improvement here! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"For a chain sandwich shop this place is awesome. I have eaten there many times and have  never been disappointed. Service is quick and friendly too. I prefer the Italian sub and often doctor up a cheese steak with my won toppings but the Big Kahuna cheese steak is good too. The pepper relish they have for cold subs is really good and they don't skimp if you ask for more. Lastly, they have excellent, consistently fresh iced tea and a loyalty program that gives you freebies and good coupons. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because the parking situation during the lunch and, to a lesser extent, the dinner rush is a nightmare."}
{"text":"Today's experience was interesting.  This was my second visit to Jersey Mikes, first time at the Gilbert location.  My first impression about the restaurant was that it was very clean .  The menu is small, and there are only two types of bread to choose from, but there is something to please everyone.  The food tasted wonderful.  The meat and veggies were fresh and the bread tasted good.    The staff was where they lost me.  The slicer seemed incredibly disinterested.  When  we asked what the sizes were, he gave us some short, inaudible response.  When asked to repeat it, we heard only the word \"regular\".  The condiment guy only put half of what we asked for on the sandwiches.  I actually had to ask for stuff on the side. The cashier was the most cordial of the three.  She at least attempted to care, but instead of charging us for meals (drink and chip with sandwich),  she charged our items individually.  I'm not sure I'll come back for a while."}
{"text":"Lots of workers here to move the lines as quickly as they can. I have never had Jersey Mikes before so I'm not sure if this was a good first time place to visit. The sandwich was pretty good, I had it Mikes Way since everyone says that's good. I got the supreme and it was pretty packed with meat. the prices are crazy but that's airport food I guess. for a cold cut, I think jimmy johns is better."}
{"text":"I have never been a sandwich person until here. The sandwiches are simple with a ton of flavor. Small shop, fresh ingredients, and great customer service. The price is higher than most but I think the quality of meat is better and that's why.   I like their turkey provolone sandwich \"mikes way\". Their Italian spices and oil and vinegar they use in mikes way is delicious. Makes the sub juicy and refreshing!   This is a huge step up from your normal subway, blimpie, ect..  Highly recommend for a good sub (:"}
{"text":"Clean store. Customer service lacking. Employees need refresher course on customer service and how to greet customers.  The person assisting us seemed we were bothering him."}
{"text":"Upon entering went to the counter and waited approx 10 minutes while attended another customer. Their was 3 other employees but they were busy stocking the store. Store was clean.  I order 2 Turkey wraps and disappointed at the appearance.  They were not cut in half."}
{"text":"Every time I come here this place seems to always be in disarray.   I went there a couple nights ago and they were completely out of bread; just making sandwiches with wraps, or whatever they could find--instead of the yeasty goodness of a sub roll. Yesterday, they were out of wheat bread, just had white; and on a separate occasion, they only had minis.   I asked the employee why they always had bread problems, and her response was that the owner doesn't allow the employees to actually bake the bread themselves. So when they run out, they just run out.   What's up with this bread dilemma, get it together!"}
{"text":"I've picked up a sandwich here several times in the past. I love their tuna!   Anyway...I went in today and stood there for about 5 minutes waiting for the kid behind the counter to realize I was there (he was cleaning the cooktop). As he prepares my sandwich I go to select my toppings and realize that the lettuce is yellow and slimy. Absolutely disgusting. They don't have spinach or an alternative and did not offer to get fresh lettuce.  Their selections in general are pretty minimal, and now I have doubts about the sanitation of their food.  I don't think I'll be able to eat there again.     Went with the husband who thought he had a coupon (wasn't valid at this location). He got the Big Kahuna and I got a tuna sandwich. Once again the entire tray of lettuce was yellow and slimy!!! Seriously-wtf?! We asked her to change it, and she did. Sandwiches were sub-par (lots of bread, little filling) and we watched the manager get a ticket on her vehicle because she was parked IN THE HANDICAP SPOT upfront. Ridiculous.   Worst location of Jersey Mike's-EVER. And I 100% will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is a great place to eat!  The manager, Manny, was so generous recently and donated 2 boxes of wonderful sandwiches for our planning committee meeting for the Las Vegas Walk to End Alzheimer's!   Everyone raved about the fresh, great-tasting sandwiches.  Also, he was generous in providing us with coupons for future visits, which I will be sure to use.  It is wonderful when a business wants to get involved in helping a community charity.  I have told many of my friends about Jersey Mike's kindness and generosity."}
{"text":"The freshest lunch meat makes the best subs.  This place is awesome.  Three sizes of subs to choose from.  I go here often and the bread is as fresh as the meat.  Order it your way or \"Mike's Way\"."}
{"text":"A sandwich is a sandwich at these places, so I won't rave about a roast beef. It was good, and real roast beef (though pretty rare). This place is better than Subway, Quiznos, and Jimmy John's. Good place to grab a sandwich for lunch and reasonably priced. They also send out pretty good coupons. Give it a whirl on a day when you're in the mood for a sandwich an can't make a decision from where. That happens to me like once a week. Minimum."}
{"text":"Brown lettuce has become the norm. Sad, they have a great product, but they handle prep all wrong. Staff don't seem to take their time to make a pleasing sub. Slap it together and on to the next poor soul."}
{"text":"hmmmmmm.... something has changed... the place was a mess, crumbs on every table, drink area a disaster, sloppier made sandwich... better bounce back!! I miss the old crew!!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for J Mike's vinegary goodness. This location is always quick and friendly. Great location tucked behind stonecrest, makes it easy to avoid the traffic madness."}
{"text":"Theses guys work so hard for customers who tend to be rude and unappreciative at times. Always nice, clean place and great food. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Always consistent and good. Bread is the best around which makes for  an authentic east coast hoagie or cheesesteak. Staff is always very friendly. Love the Big Kahuna steak!! And the red pepper sauce is addicting !!"}
{"text":"I loooooove Jersey Mike's. The #7 is the most delicious thing on the planet. The staff here is very nice"}
{"text":"First time to this Jersey Mike not impressed the floor looks like it hasn't been cleaned or mop the bathroom men's bathroom is trashed the windows aren't even clean they don't even have the open sign on and then has three TVs only one TV on playing baseball that's it so the employees don't care about cleanliness the food is okay but definitely some improvements need to be made to the cleanliness of the establishment"}
{"text":"#8 or 13 Mike's way with jalapeños and pickles or a #99 with extra mayo and provolone instead of American. They always do a really good job making sure everything is up to their standard. My only issue is that there is one guy there who tries to work quickly but he only ends up working sloppily. Taking the extra 2 seconds to do your job won't kill anyone but it'll stop you from getting mayo on EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"Great subs, the Club Supreme mike's style was really good"}
{"text":"Best Subs around. And their best? For me it is the #13 Original but I like Dale's way and not Mike's way. My way everything, extra Banana Peppers and extra Pepper relish"}
{"text":"My favorite subs come from Jersey Mike's. I'm glad that I've discovered another location! For me it #13 with everything, extra peppers and relish."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's coming to Bainbridge is kind of a big deal because before this, they have had the same Subway in the same place for decades. It will be nice to have some fresh competition around to keep them on their toes! While somewhat similar to Subway, Jersey Mike's is known for their hot and cold subs, so I think it is more similar to Quizno's. They slice all meats and cheeses fresh in front of you while you wait, so you know that the lunch meat hasn't been sitting out for hours. They also have a \"special sauce\" of olive oil, red wine vinegar, and oregano that they add to all of their sandwiches, which is a nice touch. It's nothing special, just subs, salads (or subs in tubs as they call them), chips and cookies, but it's a good place to quickly stop for lunch/dinner on your way home. It's fairly priced, and I'm interested to see how they do compared to Subway/Panera all within a mile of each other."}
{"text":"I'm writing this because I have to disagree with a previous review from Josh. This was our first time  visiting because they had the GF bun for my wife. According to her the bun was the best GF she has had, only a little dry unlike  most GF bread which crumbles and is very dry. The bread was fluffy and had a hard crust and did not crumble, she gave it a 7-8 if 10 is a normal bun. So kudos to Jersey Mikes for finding a great GF bun. Josh is right the subs are  more expensive than Subway but they offer three sizes and the amount of meat on the sub is significantly larger. If you prefer a significantly smaller amount of meat and more bread go to Subway at Jersey Mike's they pile it on.  I included a picture of the amount of meat never seen anything this thick unless you get the triple meat at Subway or in their commercial but remember there is an up charge for additional meat.  We both had the medium Italian which is 8 inches not 6, we both only ate half because of the amount of meat. I have no problem eating the 6 inch at Subway and always want more.   Remember you get what you pay for and we obviously don't eat subs much any more since the GF allergy but will be back to JM's no doubt. By the way Josh was dead on with cleanliness and friendliness."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good, but the last two times I've ordered online my order hadn't even been looked at when I arrived.  I don't understand the point of having an online option if it is ignored."}
{"text":"The reuben was great. Loved the night guys when we went. Great service and very fun time."}
{"text":"There's a group of guys that work the weekends that are great, so you get two stars.   But today, thank you to the Jersey Mike's staff for: - stale bread - thin shredded pieces of roast beef  - way too much oil and vinegar after I repeatedly said only a little - attitude  - overpriced food  When I asked them to make my sandwich again on bread that's not stale, one girl had the balls to ask me if I ate the first sandwich. She didn't see it, but I took one bite and threw it out.  Such crap. No apology, nothing.  Store manager didn't want anything to do with it.   The day shift today blew it for me forever.  I already have an issue paying 12-13 dollars for a sandwich chips and a drink at a fast food restaurant so I will not put up with crap service.  A goddamn LEGIT sandwich with chips and a drink at Nicoli's doesn't even cost that much.  Got home and threw my vinegar soaked sandwich out."}
{"text":"Place is awesome. Rarely ever disappoints. We order for the office all the time and its our goto sub shop. I will say someone was clearly disgruntled today spreading more oil than BP did in the Gulf. Still a great sub though!"}
{"text":"This guy is the only one here and taking his sweet time and I'm in a hurry. Get some hustle dude. Its lunch time!  Oh wait a second guy here and things are still slow! Omg! The second guy is not helping the first and I think he is the manager. This dude has to wash his hands after taking payment each time. That's good but its causing this place to be slow!!!!!!  Manager should be taking payment and letting the employee make the food!  Thumbs down for SLOW SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Had the club for lunch and it was very good. Bread and all the other ingredients seemed very fresh and quality. Great lunch place , decently priced."}
{"text":"Sandwich! I am giving this place 5 starts because this is one of the best sandwiches I have had. My logic is that this is fast food, its bread ,meat and toppings, not gastro rocket science. Five stars as this place does it well consistently. Big Kahuna, grilled beef or chicken, shrooms, peppers, onion, hot peppers, cheese and typical sub toppings plus chipotle mayo. Great bread, not greasy,  and great customer service. No fried shit.  This place does sandwiches well, everything is fresh.   Its a chain, I hate chains, but the several times a year a crave this kind of stuff, i will drive out of my way for it. The meat does not give me heartburn. The portions are nice,it is also pretty economical. 14 inch subs for under 9$ plus coupons. Puts subway to shame.  Other subs fanstatic. So for a fast food sub place I have not found better, unless you like copious amounts for grease and cheap meat,  going into a mall, and rude service : )"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in so long I didn't even realized they closed! My last experience with them left a bad taste in my mouth from product to customer service. I went in because of the flyer we received in the mail for a free sub and I must say I will DEFINITELY be returning. I have never been so happy with the attitude of any staff as I was here! They were such a delight to experience!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed big kahuna  cheese steak ! I substituted the meat for tuna mad adds cheese. It was super awesome . And they have teacher discount !"}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mike's. The food is consistently good and they have a quality product. I just don't get WHY a fast food restaurant is asking your customers if they want to TIP?  Cooks don't get tipped but servers do. This is a Fast Food restaurant not Casual Dining where tipping is expected because the server makes less than minimum-wage. A server depends on the tips to make up the difference in their hourly wage. If you feel your Staff needs to be tipped, my recommendation is, pay them appropriately. Jersey Mike's is a Fast Food restaurant and asking your customers to tip the staff in not appropriate in this situation.  In closing, I would also suggest you re- visit your customer demographics. The stores music selection is incredibly inappropriate for your customer base."}
{"text":"I really like Jersey Mike's, I've never had a bad sub from there and getting your sub \"Mike's Way\" is always a good choice. All of their ingredients taste fresh and I definitely think it's a better chain than subway or Penn Station. I find their service to be very fast and friendly most of the time, however not all of their workers communicate much while ordering, or I've had a few mumble. Regardless, they always get the order right and I always leave happy."}
{"text":"I wanted give this place try, since we have eaten at other sandwich shops near by. Sorry was not  impressed at all with the food, the bread was hard and stale, they lack choice of toppings, the cold cuts, i have had better. The service was good, until it was time to pay, it asked if i wanted to tip and at those prices, i thought not, any ways when i picked no, the girl just sighed. I will stick to Jimmy Johns , Pot Belly's ,Firehouse and yes even Subway."}
{"text":"Just got a sandwich from this location today and the guys working were so nice! They greeted me enthusiastically at the door and just the vibe of the whole shop was pleasant, it appeared the three or four employees got along with each other really well...I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I work in Greenway Station and a co-worker had a sub from Jersey Mike's and I asked him how it was.  He loved it.  I personally don't like subs from other places (I guess that's the right way to put it), but Jersey Mike's was great!!  I visited the shop on 3-15-17 at 6:00pm.  I was greeted right away, fresh cut meats and a fast checkout.  Even a bell ring for a tip and a thank you from everyone working.  And yes, always tip!!! :)   I couldn't be happier.  Ding Ding!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Staff is so funny and great! They joked around with us and helped us find the best sandwich, being that it was our first time here. Love this location and will come back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and got their version of an Italian. The ingredients quality was fine enough but I gotta say their Italian is nothing more than just a ham sandwich. If I wanted a ham sandwich I would have ordered just that. Where is the salami Mike?  If you want a real Italian Sub ladies and gents head up to 16th St & Bethany Home Rd. to Niccoli's and get it done right!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm. Greatest sub I've had in a long time. A little bit on the pricey side but I think it's totally worth it. Good staff great environment even better sandwich. Best Sub shop around!"}
{"text":"Hello Jersey Mikes!! I am a frequent customer at the  Franklin Square Phase III 3754 East Franklin Blvd. Franklin Square Phase III Gastonia, NC 28054   (704) 823-7827 UNFORTUNATELY I WILL NEVER EVER eat at this restaurant again. I'm a flight attendant and I always buy a #13 Giant sometimes two for the other flight attendant and always request mikes way on the side. Well today the owner was in there and I cringed when I walked in because he wasn't very nice the last time I was there. Usually when I go it's during the middle of the week and he's not there. I walked in and no hello, no welcome to jersey mikes NOTHING. I had already called my order in and walked through the normal line because I was the only one in there. I had my 3 year old with me and he grabbed a bag of KC masterpiece  potato Chips and we stood there. We just stood there. The owner continued to slice onions and said nothing to me. He didn't say \"mam we will be right with you\" nothing. I was invisible. So a minute or two later he calls back to the employees and lets them know an invisible person is waiting to be cashed out. I checked over on my sandwich and saw that the order was correct, but I would have like more lettuce for the sandwich. I would have PAID for more lettuce had I been given the option too. However that was not extended to me. He went on to tell me that, that was the amount of lettuce for a giant and that I just wanted free lettuce and that I wanted a salad and I wanted more than the sandwich required. I'm standing there listening in disbelief and responded that I could  purchase more lettuce if that was  going to be a problem, and it seemed to me that it was a problem. I told him never mind I could purchase my sandwich at he Charlotte store closer to the airport. He let me know, as he was getting a empty container that Charlotte would not let me get \"free\" lettuce.  He puts lettuce in the container and drops in on the counter \" here you go mam\" the container lid pops open because he dropped/through it at th counter. I said you know what keep your sandwich. I let him know that I knew he was the owner and the last time I came in here he was rude except there were other patrons in there. However the last time I was in the line to buy a sandwich, I was the only one that looked like me in the line. I don't ever, ever, ever want to say that I've been mistreated by the color of my skin. But every time the owner is in there he is hateful to me. I've  seen him interact with other patrons that don't look like me.  I refuse in 2017 to be humiliated in front my 3 year old or anybody else because I'm a black woman and you think I want free lettuce. His attitude is VERY rude and he has uncouth customer service!! My experience will be passed along. I will tell everybody I know about my experience. I will make it my life duty to share my experience. I will tell every passenger on my plane about how Jersey Mikes Franchises to people that really want to place a \"whites only\" sign in there window. I will share my experience to every crew I fly with. Every hotel I sleep in that Jersey Mike's Franklin Square Phase III 3754 East Franklin Blvd. Franklin Square Phase III Gastonia, NC 28054  (704) 823-7827 allows for people to mistreated because I'm black and I want free lettuce."}
{"text":"First visit. We had Jersey Mikes Famous Philly and the Original Italian.   Very impressed. Be sure to get your free cookie if it's your first visit. Free cookie for \"rookies.\"  We'll go back again!"}
{"text":"I really dislike this spot. I have been there twice now and both times I was disgusted by the rotten tomatoes and the soaking wet lettuce sitting at the bottom of the pan. I walked out the second time. If the items I'm about to eat look like it will make me sick I'm not interested in going back.  Its just that simple. Hopefully they will get their act together because other Jersey Mikes i have been to rocked"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are very tasty. The chipotle cheese steak is great, the club supreme and meatball are also great. It is a little more pricey than other sandwich places but I would still recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered thru doordash and got the mini tuna and the #5 cold-cut.  They really do nail the hoagie style from the Jersey area but I should have read some reviews first, and the menu more closely I guess.  The bread on the cold-cut sub was mushy due to the dressing.  And there was no mayo.  I guess I'm dumb to think that's kinda a no-brainer.  So my bad.  The tuna was giant for a \"mini-sub\" and also bread was soggy by the time I got to try it.  AGAIN, my bad.  Maybe there should be some option like, \"dressing on the side,\" for us here in AZ.  Today was a beautiful day and the reason for me not going out was laziness.  Had I ordered this in July, my reason for getting delivery would include not wanting to ruin my day getting in and out of the oven that your car becomes when you are parked for more than 15 minutes.  So probably a lot of peeps will be getting soggy bread sandwiches when ordering thru a delivery service and those reviews aren't going to help the business succeed."}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mike's. There simply is no reason to go anywhere else. The roast beef is as good as it gets. I particularly like the Camelback and central location. The manager, Mike and his staff are particularly friendly, fast and consistent with their excellent quality, and the place is always clean!"}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mikes, I always have! It's my favorite sub place and I've been going to various ones for over 15 years and it never disappoints. I especially like this location, the staff is always very nice and super quick! Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's had the best submarine sandwiches around. However, service at this location is seriously slow compared to others in the region, hence the three stars. The workers need to be more motivated to get customers in and out in a timely manner. I've never been in and out in less than 5 minutes, even if there are only 1-2 customers in front of me. Also, their meat portions seem scaled down compared to University, Concord Mills, and Copperfield. Otherwise, I love this chain."}
{"text":"This was my family and my first visit to this establishment. My daughter has Celiac Disease and she has to eat gluten free. She read a review that Jersey Mike's is offering gluten free bread-Udis to be exact for people who have Celiac Disease or are gluten sensitive. The young man who waited on my daughter took precautions and used a different slicer and area that he cleaned in order to properly prepare her sub. He was very careful not to allow any cross contamination. He also changed his gloves, used differently utensils, etc. My daughter enjoyed her sandwich immensely and has leftovers for lunch tomorrow. She ordered the #8 club sub-Giant on Udis Gluten bread. I ordered the #13 Italian on regular white sub bread. My husband ordered the #9 Club Supreme . The sandwiches were fresh and delicious. The restaurant is clean and organized. Customer service is excellent. We will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Very tasty - been twice now. The italian was outstanding - hands down best sub shop of all the chains. Puts Subway to shame. Better than Cousins and even Blimpies which I used to frequent (not anymore!). I would give 5 stars but the cheese steaks are lacking - they have good meat and bread, but they need to toast the bread, and the cheese turns too melted/watery. But the cold sandwiches are amazing. Excellent service too."}
{"text":"Food is good but I don't anymore because they didn't honor the discount card I bought from the local high school... twice..."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and even worse staff! First, I tried to do a call ahead an hour before lunch time given the busyness of the lunch rush. Unfortunately, I called in over 36 times in 49 minutes to a constantly busy phone line. Irritated, I drove up to the location and placed my order in person to a young lady. Two number 17's, both add mushrooms, 86 peppers in one of them. I heard her relay the correct verbal order and she wrote it correctly on the order slip. I have to allow two people ahead of me because my hot subs were taking too long. When they ask me to pay, I politely stated that I'd like to wait until I can confirm if they made it correct the second time. I was told no, so I paid for them. I asked the kid on the grill what was in it, he stated it was correct, so I leave. I then drive back to my office to discover BOTH subs are wrong- one because of bread choice, the other because it lacked mushrooms. Extremely irritated and hungry (plus having paid for two wrong orders now, even while one was remade,) I called to speak with a supervisor. I was placed on hold for several minutes (though it was not 'on hold,' but rather just had the phone on the counter as I could hear representatives speaking about me on the line) until the kid who was working the grill answered and said he was the 'shift lead.' I explained the issue with him and politely requested either a) a refund for my orders or b) the delivery of new sandwiches because I did not have time to come back to their location. This kid did NOTHING to remedy the situation, only made it worse. He went on to state that he was the one who took the verbal order from the girl and was told 'to cut the peppers up tiny.' Um, no, you didn't. I was there, I heard her and read her lips - PLUS, it was on the order ticket. He continued to argue with me stating that he didn't make it wrong. I finally had to explain to him that I am the customer, I have paid for two subs that are wrong, and I want a refund. He told me he wasn't authorized to do that but that I could come in at a later time and speak with the GM.   This is an EXTREMELY unprofessional location with HORRIBLE customer service, and takes zero accountability for their own mistakes. I am a busy professional and am not able to return to their location - especially after the already elongated wait of having to remake it the first time) and wasn't even able to get lunch at this point because everywhere is over an hour wait for delivery. I will NEVER be back and I will be damn sure to share with members of my staff (several hundred) to not order here, nor will we be ordering for any future catering needs. This place is a joke when it comes to customer service, etiquette, professionalism, or respect."}
{"text":"Not so good, Jersey Mike.   I am a bake my sub kind-of-girl.   No oven?! Not going to win high points with me.    Menu is easy to follow.  Just subs.  In fact, this should be the name of the place.  Just Subs. Shouldn't have too many people confused with this limited selection.  Quality of ingredients looks better than most places.  No pre-slicing here.  Meats and cheeses appear sliced to order. Prices are definitely higher.   Kind of a skimpy sub for the price. My sub tasted ok.  Description didn't match the product.   I didn't have any issues with the staff.  Very courteous and helpful.  Truthfully,  if every other place near me did not look like a mob scene, I doubt if I would have stopped here.   I think the only Jersey I  will visit next ,will be at the seashore."}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes is always consistently good no matter what location you visit. The staff is friendly and given the choice between this and other sandwich or fast food places I choose JM."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where these guys came from, but it's not from Jersey.  Thin sandwich, definitely not the way we make it.  Mike from JERSEY"}
{"text":"I went to Jersey Mike's for the first time today, after seeing it on the Travel Channel. I'm from Boston and used to live in New Jersey, where Jersey Mike's was founded. With out question, this was the best sub I've had in AZ. I got the Club, \"Mike's Way\", which means that they add tomatoes, shredded lettuce, oil and vinegar, and seasoning. It was like a taste of home. If you're craving a Northeast style sub, this is the place! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"All the worker's are great and the manager Ray is awesome too!! Subs are always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mike's! They definitely have the best subs that I've ever had from a sandwich place! The staff members are hit-or-miss though. Sometimes when I go in they are so fantastic and other times they make me feel like an inconvenience to them for ordering a sandwich."}
{"text":"Okay where to begin? Urban Spoon App pick. Clean, plenty of places to sit, indoors and outdoors. Already its blowing any Sub/Grinder shop Ive been to out of the water. All the sandwiches I saw being made looked ridiculously good! I had the Big Kahuna which is their Philly Cheesesteak with mushrooms and jalapenos added. Now I dont understand the people complaining about not getting your money's worth? Are you kidding me?? This isnt Taco Bell?? Its a friggin sub shop. $14 for 2  well endowed subs is expensive? If this is too rich for your blood. try the dollar menu at Jack in The Box. Or are you one of those that prefer the entire animal in your sandwich (ex. Miracle Mile/Jason's Deli) Ridiculous! Their \"regular\" size is approx an 8 inch sub and they're far from stingy. One average sized person will be more than satisfied with a \"regular\" sandwich???. Seriously to have to order a Large or have chips on top of your regular is just unnecessary spending and overkill on the food front. It's like people are brainwashed into thinking you have to have a side with everything you eat.. Im not cheap Im just not overeating...If you can eat a regular + add ons....you're either planning for leftovers, an athlete, a grown man, trying to gain weight,  or are friggin stoned !  As for other comments about it being soggy. Yes it was a bit but not falling apart or seemingly dipped in au jus soggy. My \"grinder\" was fan freakin tastic! It reminded me of D'Angelos #7 for all you East Coasters that may be familiar with that chain. LOVED it!"}
{"text":"Came to this location tonight, 12/19 around 7:15pm, and the store had a a sign that said \"Sorry, No Bread\". I asked if this was for real, and the employees just said sorry. So, either there was a biblical rush on sandwiches (not very likely) or the employees just wanted to leave early. I've been to a lot of sandwich shops around the country, but this was definitely a first."}
{"text":"#13 original sub made Mike's way is my favorite choice.  This chain beats Subway, Togo's & Quizno Sub hands down!  We were shopping at the outlet but decided not to eat in their food court because the choices were truly horrid.  I am glad we came here because the ladies that were on shift were very friendly & greeted us well.  The place was clean, customer service was excellent &, of course, the food is always delicious.  I just love Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Meat and cheese was fresh-sliced, lettuce, tomato were fresh and Good! Service was quick and efficient, sub was delicious, with just the right amount of meat and cheese. My husband and I split a regular size and felt it was a nice size for lunch. We had just eaten a (too huge!) sandwich at a HoneyBaked Ham location a few days before and the contrast was delightful!  First time there and we are Fans!"}
{"text":"Their Original Italian sub sandwich is absolutely the best.  The deli meats are sliced to order and placed on fresh baked-in-house bread.  I get the giant size made up Mike's Way and it is outstanding.  They get a lot for this sandwich, but trust me, it's worth it."}
{"text":"That absolute best sub chain I have ever been in.  Fresh shaved deli  meats and cheeses.  I have not ventured past the RB because it is that good!  Higher priced that Subway ; however quality and quantity is superior!"}
{"text":"I loved 'em when I lived in Jersey and I love 'em here in Arizona!  Friendly, capable, conscientious crew at this location, as well as the ASU/Rural Rd. location.  Some people will have a problem with their bread but I've always preferred it to any of the other sub places around.  LOVE the Big Kahuna Cheesesteak (ask for them to make it with chicken to save on fat/calories) and I love the refillable Breast Cancer Cup, which makes it a bit more affordable. Also, coupons are everywhere nowadays so even though they are a bit pricier than other places, with a coupon it's a bit closer to their prices--yet SO much tastier!"}
{"text":"This Jersey Mikes always has fresh ingredients, the atmosphere is nice and clean always nice to beat the heat in Arizona when you walk in. My usual is the club sub can't beat that I have it done Mikes Way of course. Although the ingredients are always fresh the bacon can contain more flavor they should use a different cut of bacon taste kind of bland. Although great customer service and environment definitely an upgrade from Subway."}
{"text":"They took forever to start making my sandwich because they had to clean the slicer, even though I got a tuna. Then the tuna was disgusting with consistency of almost water. Then when I pay I get the wrong change back. Then my boyfriend got a #8 which come with bacon and they never put it in, so he shows them that there is no bacon on there and they argue with him for about a whole minute how they remember seeing/ putting it on there. Finally they gave him bacon. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"It wasn't as busy and the service was good, I got the club sub, but just wasn't feeling the sub. I just thought it was ok. Nothing good or bad, just right there with mediocre."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and friendly staff! I have never had a sandwich with oil and vinegar before, but now I'am hooked. I got the #9 which is roast beef, turkey, and bacon it was sooo good! I also picked up sandwiches for the office and everyone loved it. I am so happy Jersey Mike's is close to my work I will be eating here all the time."}
{"text":"We have been to almost all the Jersey Mikes locations and this one is by far the best!! Ive had different staff three different times, and each and every time they were attentive and super friendly! I mean, it is a little pricey for a giant sub, but its so delicious.... its worth the treat! We always get the giant subs so we can eat at least 2 meals (usually 3) off it. The famous roast beef is always so delicious, tender and flavorful! No one makes a better one (says the boyfriend)! I have fallen in love with the California Club! I was so upset when they told me that its discontinued! I swear that everything I like, every restaurant discontinues!! They were so nice and offered to check if they had avocados in the back, if they did, they would make the Cali club for me! They had an avocado...I was overjoyed! The sandwiches were both seasoned perfectly Mikes Way! The super awesome staff even puts the Mikes Way \"juice\" only on half, then they give us a little cup to go of \"Mikes Juice\" for later. This is super helpful as the sandwich doesn't get soggy, its perfect to eat later! Hands down, this location has the most friendly staff! We will certainly continue to come back to this location!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a big fan with jersey mikes there easy simple and quick.  For me  I really don't like the pushy staff that are trying to get a tip out of you even when it's very obvious you don't want to chat with them. Also a few time my food didn't smell or taste right, be careful ordering the chicken philly. Also I don't know how there able to get away with there deli slicer.since I have seen them cut different types of deli meat and cheese with it and not cleaning it between cuts totally grosses me out.   The pros  there bread it's very soft and tasty They have a nice seating area They have a bunch of different chips to chose from If you like Pepsi products they have them."}
{"text":"The #9 is my favorite. I love how they slice the meat for every order. Mikes way is the way to go. I been going to Jersey since I lived in California I'm glad I found one close to home and work. Friendly service and they get your order right every time."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town!! Super fresh and they have the \"mini.\"  Just enough sandwich without all the bread. Yum!"}
{"text":"This review is being entered a day late. myself and two other friends went here for lunch. I had thw roast beef. my friends had tuna and turkey. what to say... both friends stated the sandwich was bland, very little taste. my roast beef was also very bland. the meat was cooked with no seasoning, the oil and vinegar taste was over powered by the bland taste of the meat. the theme here is BLAND food!  for the money I will go to subway around the corner."}
{"text":"Moved in the neighborhood about three weeks ago and this Jersey Mike's is a staple of my week. They have the best Philly in town. Talk to Bee she there  most evenings.  She cares about you and your experience with and trust me it shows."}
{"text":"Their Chipotle Philly Cheesesteak is so good! I love this place more than any other sandwich place."}
{"text":"The place to go for a meaty sub! The choices vary for the sandwich selection, this is a plus!"}
{"text":"I'm a Huge JM Fan!  Go to a lot of stores and this one is on there game.  Knowledgeable friendly staff, that works clean, put the right amount of juice on my sub and made my day."}
{"text":"The subs \"hoagie\" was okay, not exceptional. The steak sandwich was lacking flavor. The service was good except the check out. I had a coupon for a discount on a regular size sub. I bought the giant size and was refused the discount. Dah! Next time I will buy less to get the discount or perhaps not come back. Bad Business Practice. This is probably a once and done visit."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is a great place to pick up a fresh made to order sub.  This location was clean and the staff were very friendly.  I ordered the Philly steak and also an Italian for the next day.  I highly recommend this location if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today (7/29) around 11:15. Stood in line for a while and then someone (scruffy blondish hair) came to take our order. I was ordering two giant subs, one mini, and a kids meal which I think is a totally reasonable order. My husband and son were sitting at a table near by so they wouldn't have to wait in line with me. When the guy is taking my order he doesn't let me finish and when I say, \"oh, one more still\" he replies \"oh God\" with a ton of attitude. I was going to just let this slide since I already had spent time waiting in line. He wrote down the order for the last sandwich and then says, \"I was going to help the rest of the line but not now\" (again, full of attitude). He walked away and I thought about what I wanted to do because I hate being rude or confrontational. I then stepped up and said, \"Excuse me, sir. You can just cross out my order. The attitude was not needed\" to which he responded, \"okay\" and I turned around to leave, recounting what happened to my husband as we walked out the door. I've been to this location before but usually go to one closer to my home in Gilbert. I will never ever ever come back here. That was seriously the rudest anyone has ever been to me in a customer service setting."}
{"text":"Authentic, yummy subs. Friendly staff. Fresh taste!"}
{"text":"I love these subs. Delicious. I was born n raised in Point Pleasant Beach, NJ, less than one mile from the one original sub shop, decades ago. My childhood years were filled with Friday night subs from Mike's. I am so friggin' happy to have a location so close to me. They are pricier than I remember. Oh well, Whattyagonna do? You guys should give me an \"O.G. status\" discount next time I'm in there. Original Dirty Jerz from back in the day. I'm no Benny. I'll walk in with my gold chain necklace and black Adidas track suit. A real \"Goodfella\" from the neighborhood. Hook me up. 5 stars, that's no BS. This ain't no chincy Subways garbage. It's Mike's, it's the BEST, you hear me? Extra juice, Mike's way, Number 13. Go Devils!"}
{"text":"Went once and order was good , went back three days ago and was terrible . I ordered the same thing twice .  Steak and Cheese , I guess it depends on who is behind the counter when you go there ."}
{"text":"This Jersey Mike's location makes great subs and cheesesteaks. I've never had a bad meal here. Because of their convenient location they're often inundated at lunch. The restaurant is generally clean. There are acres and acres of parking.   My only negative comment is that their employees have never once been friendly, and occasionally they hire a young employee who will be totally clueless. Clueless, meaning.....when one orders a drink the employee fails to provide a cup, and they act totally indifferent to a customer's presence in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit to this sub shop and both times the Regular sandwiches (Original Italian w/ everything and the Jersey Mike's Philly Cheese Stake) were FANTASTIC! (though, I can't see how a Regular can serve 2 people. :D ). Loved the cut to order meats and cheeses and the bread tastes like it was made that morning.  The staff is friendly and efficient.   Going to have to try everything on the menu.  The only down side is that they don't carry Coca-Cola products. But, since that company screwed up the forumula, it's not as good as it use to be anyway. :(  And, IMO, it's hard to compare Jersey Mike's to Fire House, as the sandwiches are completely different because of the bread. And, probably because of the supplier of the meats and cheeses."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is the closest to a Philadelphia steak that we can get here in the Carolina's. The service is awesome. Owner is great and all of the employees. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Birthday freebie! Free regular sub on your bday.  Order a Kahuna sub, and it was freaking amazing! Staff was really friendly, and wished me a happy birthday. Bathrooms were clean and there was plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I cannot express how cool these people are, my sandwiches are always spot on and the people are so friendly I can't even imagine going to jimmy johns"}
{"text":"This is a rare 5 star here. I flip flop on sandwich joints all the time, but right now, it's Jersey Mikes. And its not just this location either, every one I've eaten at is divine. I love, love, love the bread. Crispy on the outside and a nice loose crumb on the inside with a nice chewy texture. I tell you what, you can have the best ingredients in the world for the insides and ruin it with crappy bread but these guys have it right. A good sandwich starts with the bread! Period! The only slightly annoying thing is with JM, if you pay by card, you're presented with the guilt tip option on the card swipe device. Not that I'm against tipping, tip all you want but I don't believe it should be forced or asked for."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Jersey Mikes. The biggest surprise was the bread. Not your typical subway/port o subs/jimmy johns soft roll, no sir, this bread has the classic crusty outside, soft and oh so good inside. That, for me, pulled these guys up a notch in my eyes. The rest of the sandwich was your basic meat/cheese/veggie stuff. I do like the sweet cherry pepper relish. Adds a nice tang to the whole thing. This particular location had a great, very friendly staff too which makes the whole experience a good one."}
{"text":"Cheesesteaks and hospitality on point. I'll be back!  Can't wait to try their pastrami!"}
{"text":"Usually LOVE eating here and have amazing service. Walked in very hungry today and waited 10 minutes for someone to take our order. At that point we were asked what we wanted and told that was told that our orders would have to wait 15 to 20 minutes because there was a bunch of online orders that had just come in. I took my paper and set it on the counter and walked out. Since when is the customer in the store served after those who chose to not leave their home and place an order they grub hub. If your that busy with online orders have a team that handles just that. Make your presentable customer first. I will not be back and neither will my friend. I will go to another Mike's  who appreciates those that come to be their patrons."}
{"text":"Have been to this location a couple of times. The staff is always relatively friendly and gets the orders fast. I like how they cut the meat right in front of you. This time I got the Italian sub mikes way. It tasted awesome! There bread is fresh and fluffy. Try also have a student discount and you get chips and a drink for a total of about $7.55. Great deal! I have seen people complain about ants in the soda machine, but I didn't get any in my Mountain Dew. Over all this place is great, clean, delicious and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"My BF and I came here for the first time last week while on lunch break and we throroughly enjoyed our meals! We both ordered the Italian sub"}
{"text":"Well I'll start with the fact that last week I got food poisoning from this location. So just don't go there. BUT prior to that I didn't go there much anyways because the staff is so rude. They are more concerned with their conversations between each other than listening to my order. There is one girl in particular who is just annoyed to be at work. God forbid you don't want your sandwich \"mikes way\" she literally rolls her eyes, sighs or shrugs. I was on the fence anyways but after the food poisoning I will not return. In case you're wondering I got a tuna sandwich."}
{"text":"Mayfield is not lacking when it comes to sub shops.  Lots of options.  I love a good sandwich so I decided to try out Jersey Mikes.  I never heard of them before and I didn't know what to expect.  I walked in and it was clean and bright with 3 people behind the counter.  They have a clean dining area.  Mike (THE Mike?) greeted me and took my order, a Sub Club Mike's Way.  He put the meats on a bun and then passed the sandwich to another worker who finished the sandwich and asked me if I wanted it Mikes Way. (Of course) Mike then stepped down to the register and rung me up for $7.  The third worker had their back to the counter.   The service seemed rushed, yet they weren't busy and workers didn't look happy to be there.  When I got home I found they made the wrong sandwich!?  Instead of a Club, they left out the bacon and mayo.  It was just a dry turkey sub.   I checked the receipt and it said Sub Club. Yep, they screwed it up.    Otherwise, the sandwich was really nothing special and not very big for $7. Subway is better and cheaper.  If you order it \"Mike's Way\" as I did, it will have way too many onions, a little lettuce, tomato, herbs, oil & vinegar. There were more onions than lettuce!  I understand that mistakes happen and I really hope they do better, because with all the other sub shops in town they won't be around very long with the service I received.   In the same plaza there are 2 other places with great subs, one right next door.  If you want a real sandwich go check out the Dynamic Duo north by SOM on Rt6.  Incredibly delicious and cheap."}
{"text":"Direct competition to the Subway across the street. It's fresh cut deli meats and better menu make it a far better choice than Subway."}
{"text":"The best hot philly cheese steak!!!! Whenever in Vegas, this is the perfect place to grab a hot sub"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's Subs is where it's at, if you want an authentic Jersey Sub. Every Sub 'Mike's Way' is out of this world amazing. The staff is super helpful & well trained to ensure you get your sub the way you want it."}
{"text":"Everybody who works here is crazy genuinely nice, at least the couple times I have been here. I had had Jersey Mike's when I was living in California but I don't remember being overwhelmed. I love how they are slicing meats and cheeses as you're ordering it... Makes it seem so much better and fresher.   I'm so boring in my sandwich picks that I can't speak to some of the more creative flavors, but what I did get was great. I love oil and vinegar on my sandwich--and a big bonus is that it's so much healthier than mayo! Or at least in my mind it is...then again I eat chocolate and call it health food so what do I know.  Definitely will be back considering I drive by it every day to/from work!"}
{"text":"This is the most horrible sandwich I have ever had. The bread is so dried out that it is probably a week old. Very disappointed. Will never go back. The turkey tastes disgusting, that's probably old too and very low cheap quality. Update: went back to get my money back ($23 for 2 crappy sandwiches) and Cody thinks that their bread is supposed to be hard and dry as a cracker like the east coast. Not sure how this franchise is even in business."}
{"text":"The tuna sub was pretty good specially Mike's style. Mike's Style makes this place special compared to other places like Subway."}
{"text":"Absolute horrible customer service ! I would rather drive to a different location ! Had a hair in my food and they accused me of putting hair in my own food I don't even have hair !"}
{"text":"Great tuna, and very fresh ingredients for all Sandwiches but Alex is the reason I keep going back to this one location  .he's a very extra nice guy,  all the kids in there are very helpful and sweet."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is always a good choice! What I really like about this sub shop is the plethora of options!! Hot subs, cold subs, salads, wraps, and even breakfast sandwiches! Not only that, they have lots of meats, cheeses, and breads to choose from!  They have a gigantic meat slicer on the counter, and slice the meat right there for you! Super fresh!! Ok but that's even not the best part....  Actually, I can't decided which is the best part: the red wine vinaigrette sub dressing or the the hot pepper relish?!? All I know is that you must get BOTH!"}
{"text":"I'm fully aware that this place is a chain, but wow do they make a great sandwich with great service at the East Blvd location!  I've wondered into this location a few times when I'm in the mood for a good sandwich.  It's hard not to when you live across the street.  Every time I walk in, they say hello.  I never wait in line too long to order (great when I'm in a rush on a lunch break).  I love that they thin slice their meats and cheese to keep the sandwich fresh (I'm a turkey & provolone girl myself).  They also have THREE, count em, THREE sandwich size options...mini, regular and large.  Their mini is not so mini, but is great if you're not overly hungry.  They have a nice selection of toppings to select from if you don't want to get it Mike's Way.  Two more notes on the food.  1. they have an awesome chip selection, from super unhealthy to moderately healthy, and 2. their cookies are awesome.  I've pretty much blown through all of the cookies and they are all good.  Don't skip dessert!  Lots of places to sit if you want to take a few minutes outside the office for lunch.  Staff is incredibly friendly.  Now one last note about Jersey Mike's that has NOTHING to do with the restaurant.  When my apartment building was on fire and we were all standing outside for a few hours, the manager and an employee came around with a tray and cups of water.  In no way did they have to do this for the residents, but it's awesome when you see a local business care about the people who live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place a shot since I heard it was better then jimmy johns etc, well it was alright. Nothing to get all excited about. Bread was just covered in oil, service wasn't that great."}
{"text":"This place USED TO BE awesome before the new manager ruined it! Who thought it was a good business decision to hire this clown? The new guy/girl ( not quite sure what gender) provided me with some severely below average customer service and personally made me the worst tasting over priced sandwich I've ever had.How does one mess up something so perfect? I won't be going there anymore.Its just not worth it !!!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, Jersey mikes is my favorite sub stop of all time and I eat there very frequently, but this location in specific was not a very pleasant experience strictly because the crew was near unbearable. The food was fine but the staff for some reason had a very difficult time preparing it. The man applying the toppings to the sandwich attempted to put the lid on it after each and every ingredient I requested and even messed up mikes way. Then the girl at the register was pestering my girlfriend non stop asking if I wanted chips or drink the entire time while I was attempting to tell the other man what I wanted on my sandwich. They all had terrible attitudes and clearly hated their job. I get that work is fun for no one but the least you can do is find a job that allows you to be kind to customers."}
{"text":"This joint opened recently and I finally decided to drop in and give it a try.  I've had Jersey Mike's back in Vegas, but this was my first time trying it here in Scottsdale.  I ordered a regular sized #13 Original Italian (Provolone, Ham, Prosciuttini, Cappacuolo, Salami, Pepperoni, $6.95) and Chips ($.99). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jersey-mikes-subs-scottsdale-2?select=SAsdgro1HjRXZmKcT9oBRQ#SAsdgro1HjRXZmKcT9oBRQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jersey-mikes-subs-scottsdale-2?select=0ej781QrEV60Ea0nrKipFA#0ej781QrEV60Ea0nrKipFA  The Sandwich is OK, not great.  It doesn't leave me wanting more.  For me, it lacks something....I can't put my finger on it, but it's just not a great Sandwich to me.  TIP - The shopping mall where this place is located is very small and parking spaces are limited.  During the lunch hour and on weekends, the parking lot is overloaded and it's a mess to try and park.    Return Factor - 50%"}
{"text":"Was in the area and stopped by at 10:30 am for an early lunch the other day.  I had the #13 Original Italian Sub (Provolone, Ham, Prosciuttini, Cappacuolo, Salami and Pepperoni) $6.95 done Mike's Way (Onions, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Vinegar, Oil and Spices).  I had a bag of Jalapeno Chips and a Bottle of Water to wash it down.  Since i was probably one of the 1st orders of the day, it was really fresh....especially the Bread.  It was easily the best Sub Sandwich I've had at Jersey Mike's, ever.  Will I return?  Yep, sure will."}
{"text":"Love Jersey Mike's for a decently healthy lunch sandwich! I always order the number 7, Mike's way! I like it so much, I haven't ever tried anything else. The bread, meat/cheese, and veggies are always extremely fresh! The only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the stores aren't always efficiently ran. Sometimes they seem to get very backed up. This last time, I wait about 20 minutes before I got my sandwich, which is too long for fast food."}
{"text":"This place is legit the best tasting sandwich shop! Hot or cold you can't go wrong here! Not a lot of toppings which me personally I don't like a lot of options. So this works perfect for me. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a little bit overpriced and when you checkout it asks if you want to give them a tip!? Which subway does not do. If you're going to price the sandwiches that high you really shouldn't ask for the tip. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"so i tried jesery mikes subs for the first time, and to be honest i don't know what all the hype is all about yes my sub was good, but i just feel like they were really missing something from standing out from all the other places. i ordered online which i had the meatball i walked in, and was greeted they were polite i told them i had an online order, and they asked me for my name, and i gave it to them. i went, and got my drink, and sat and ate my sub. i did like how the bread was fresh, and it wasn't really a messy sub it was just lacking something in flavor thats all i'm saying. they have penn station thats a few doors down not going to lie if i owned a sub place, and i knew there was another sub place a few doors down i would try, and come up with new ideas how to be different from all these other sub places. i didn't hate it would i go back yeah i would i mean it wasn't the best that was out there, but it wasn't horrible it was just like any other sub place i've been too. it was very clean inside so that isn't a worry i'm glad that they at least are clean about their environment. i pretty much felt like i went to a cleaner, and a little more pricey papa joes to be honest with nicer people thats about it. as i said it wasn't terrible i just don't get what all the hype is all about with this place. still it wasn't bad what i ordered which was the meatball, and i was glad my food was ready when i came in to pick it up. i'll give them that on their speed, but i'd come back just when i'm in the mood for it next i want to try daves cosmic subs."}
{"text":"AWESOME SUBS!! I love the number 13 and will not go to any sub place to eat.. Must check it out!  The staff is very friendly and always happy"}
{"text":"We decided to come in after learning that they now offer Gluten Free sub bread! We came in right during the dinner rush and Avery was very patient with me while deciding what sub to choose from since I'm incredibly picky and they don't have a build your own option. He handled the rush incredibly well and had an amazing attitude. I've been craving a delicious gluten free sub for a long time and this one didn't let me down! I ordered the #7 that comes with 99% lean turkey and provolone. I added on shredded lettuce, mayo, oregano, salt and pepper and peperchinis. We will definitely be back thanks to the new GF bread option and great customer service!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! I order food for my whole office and their delivery is fast and friendly every time. The food is always fresh and tastes great. Much better than their competitors."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great but man it is too expensive. Today I got a sandwich and a small soda and my bill was almost $21. Come on! Yes I got a giant but it was nothing special, just the Italian sandwich with a small drink... I just can't justify the price. $21... I think it's way too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"I'm from Jersey and while I like Jersey Mikes, it is not necessarily an authentic Jersey deli experience. However, it's a lot better than most chain sandwhich places. They slice the deli meat to order and they don't have so many frills to hide a subpar product.  This location specifically has a really friendly staff. I also found the bread to be very fresh."}
{"text":"My sandwich was so saturated in watery dressing it fell apart. The lettuce tasted like goo and the chicken was bland. I refused to even feed it to my dog, absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Was in this shopping center for another reason and was hungry, so I decided to stop in Jersey Mike's.  I've been in this one before, but it's been probably a year.    First, the sandwich was fine.  Very expensive, though. $8.05 (including tax) for a regular sized sandwich.  If that was the only problem, 3 stars.    However, there were two things about the experience I didn't like at all.  The first was the machine (which looked new) used to swipe my debit card.  Before you can swipe, a screen pops up with pre-calculated tip amounts on it (10%, 15%, and 20%) and a small button off by itself reading \"no tip\".  How obnoxious.  Why would I want to tip someone who spent 2 minutes making a sandwich for me and other than me telling him what sandwich I wanted, had nothing else to say?  No, I'll save my 20% tips for my sit down restaurants and wait staff that actually talk to me, served me my food and refilled my water.  Sorry, asking for a tip on my debit card screen for making my sandwich was obnoxious.  Second, the woman who rung me up was unfriendly and blurted out the instructions so fast for paging through the two stupid screens before I could swipe my card that I couldn't understand a word she said. So, I asked her to repeat herself, and once again, she very quickly (like a rehearsed script) did it again - and faced away from me while doing so.  She seemed like she couldn't wait to get me out of there so she could go on break.  Anyway, there are far better choices all over the Chandler area for sandwiches (Planet Sub, Jimmy Johns, Firehouse, Which Wich to name a few).  Next time, I'll just drive the extra mile or two and go to one of these places."}
{"text":"This place was overpriced and not that good. The bread tasted old and stale, the meat was alright, there are just a lot better options if you want to spend $13 on a meal. The only reason I have two stars instead of one is because the workers were really nice and helpful, it's not their fault the sandwiches they're serving are not quality."}
{"text":"My chicken parm sandwich was not good.  Very messy.  The bun got mushy from the sauce.  I cut the sandwich into 2 parts.   Service was okay.  Most likely will not go back.  Sorry"}
{"text":"Great subs great price. Not entirely sure what more can be said about Jersey Mike's or any other sub place. Dear Yelp, forgive my lack of wordflow or musings. Fair prices, fresh ingredients, nice people.. Okay the truth. I'm too tired to hit the store and so it myself. And so... Order for 2 coming up."}
{"text":"Just got done doing some Christmas shopping and wanted to get a quick dinner for myself and the kids. I hadn't had Jersey Mike's for a while, so we decided to stop in. I go the #17 cheesesteak, my two oldest split a #13 Italian, and my youngest got the ham n cheese kids meal. Wasn't too bad, but wasn't as good as I remember it being. It is still better than Firehouse or Capriottis though. I guess I am just biased towards toasted subs and it is hard to find a good one in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't want to review this restaurant in a negative way, that's not my thing! But, I hated my experience! Everyone keeps telling me what a fantastic place this is and I'll never have a better sandwich! I disagree COMPLETELY! I didn't even get to order what I wanted! I felt very rushed like I had to know what \"mikes way\" meant! I've never been there. The lady that took my order was extremely rude and acted like I should know the process! I explained it was my first time, still nothing. Then, as I'm trying to get the sandwich I want, I'm ushered to pay, I don't even know what I'm paying for, dude making my sandwich is doing the opposite of what I tried to ask for. Anyway very frustrated! Got home realized I never got the drink I ordered, my sandwich was dry and felt really embarrassed by the lady that tried to make me look stupid! Much love for the friendly cashier, he is the only reason I'm giving a 2 star! Go if you're an expert, however if it's your first time expect nothing but a free cookie after they screw up!"}
{"text":"love the food but I had the worst experience with the lady who took my order she continuously cut me off in the middle of my sentences and was terribly rude the entire time. don't know her name but I was appalled by the way she treated me. the man at the cash register was amazing he almost made up for her but unfortunately I was very let down by her attitude."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and since we hadn't really unpacked our kitchen or been grocery shopping yet we decided to get sandwiches here last night. Walk in about 7:30 and I'm told \"just to let you know we're out of bread\" oh ok. Well you should probably just close for the evening and put a sign on your door since no one wants a \"sub in a tub\"....as I'm walking out another couple goes to walk in and I warn them that they're out of bread....guy's response, no joke, \"aw dammit, really? Oh well, isn't the first time...\" YOU MAKE SANDWICHES. Walk over to Sprouts and buy some bread for f's sake."}
{"text":"There you are stuck in an airport. You can have fried, fried on a bun, fried with fries or fried with a side of rice - know what I mean?   Then --- you see the red, white and blue and post up and order. Saved from the fried foods! Good sammys and really high airport prices, but hey you pay more for un-fried veggie goodness!"}
{"text":"Probably the best place for Subs in Las Vegas.  Sign-up for there club, they will send you a FREE Sub and drink for your birthday.  REALLY FREE...........not a buy one get one."}
{"text":"Love love love Jersey Mike's! The food is so fresh & yummy :-) Matt is rude. Kenidee and the rest the workers are so sweet though! Austin is super dope 10/10 for that guy"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is our go to sub place across the USA (not an exaggeration as we have been to some in Atlanta, San Francisco, and the northeast, as well as Vegas).   This location did not disappoint.  Fresh sliced meat on fresh bread and no soy chicken (I'm looking at you @Subw4y).  We usually get a large and get them to slice it in 4 so I can split it with my kids.  Yum to the 4th power."}
{"text":"I've been to Jersey Mikes A Few times.Chris the manager was very helpful.I advised him it was my first experience he went over the menu and asked me what I liked I ended up getting the 56.It was a very great sandwich Thanks Chris Keep up the Good Work."}
{"text":"I agree with the earlier poster, \"the dudes here are silly,\" which is fine, as they told me \"whats the point of going to work if you can't have fun?\"  I  ate there twice this week, the service was fast and friendly. The food was really good compared to other shops like Subway, Togos, and Quiznos. The food still tastes like its from a  smaller chain, and tastes less processed.  I really enjoyed the food, but the prices are a bit high for a sandwich. I will have to check out the location in my hometown to see if its the same. Maybe the prices are higher because its in what appears to be an upper scale area of  Las Vegas. I will definitely be back to a Jersey Mikes soon, however I don't know when I will be back in Vegas again.  If you live in Vegas near the Spring Valley area, then stop here and skip the Subway.."}
{"text":"Thank you Jersey Mike's for being a sponsor of our blood drive. The sandwiches you donated we awesome as always."}
{"text":"I love going to this place when I'm visiting Willoughby. It's my dad's favorite sub shop and now mine as well.   Not too \"froo-frooy\" on the toppings, it is pretty much standard lettuce, onion, pepper, Havarti, pepper jack etc, but they load it up and the dressings are really good.   I also really liked the anti pasta salad, never had anything like it before, all cheesy, meaty and spicey."}
{"text":"I like that they grill up the vegetables here for their veggie subs.  I thought the green peppers were scrumptious and the cheese was stacked high.  There really isn't any out of the ordinary here, just classic sandwich stuff.  I thought that the ingredients were very fresh and I like the younger folks behind the counter; they were easy to pick up a conversation with.  I prefer this over both Subway and Quiznos.  I really can't put my finger on it, maybe it is the mass quantity of fresh ingredients and the fresh baked bread."}
{"text":"I am giving one star because the other employees at this store are wonderful. This is regarding my previous concern about the rude, sarcastic, intimidating, unprofessional MANAGER.  First, let me say I recognize my order is a little particular. I ask for extra stuff, but I have iterated over and over I am more than happy to PAY for it, and I am patient, gracious, grateful, and tip the maximum EVERY time I go in. Ok, I didn't yesterday because I actually feel intimidated by that jerk.  That being said, my husband usually goes for me so I don't have to deal with that guy because he has never failed to make it clear his disdain for me. But thinking enough time had passed, I started going in occasionally. Save for one time last week when it appeared HIS supervisor was sitting there (cue the complete show of syrupy sweetness), he is consistently rude, barking orders at employees, and huffing and puffing if you ask for anything that might annoy him.  In addition to this incredibly unprofessional attitude,  he is willing to share personal information about employees. He related to my husband a female employee (who was always very nice) was fired because she 'was stealing points and giving them to her mother to use'.  I don't care if she did, you don't need an MBA to know you do not share that type of information.  Given the qualities that this location seeks in their management, I will never be returning. I have never in my life felt intimidated at anyplace I patronize reguarly and I am actually concerned he might do something to my food. I can see from other reviews I am not alone. I gave you another chance and my patience has run out."}
{"text":"fresh subs made to order. yay.  people are always super friendly. i know it's a chain....but when you are looking for a quick lunch or dinner......not a bad option. mike's way....the only way......lettuce, tomatoes, salt/pepper blend and vinegar/oil. i always ad mayo...yes. my vice.  prices fair. i think my regular turkey was 6.95.....and they are HUGE. lunch and dinner.  we seem to run here when we need something quick, but want good, fresh food.  stop in when you are craving a yummy sub."}
{"text":"4 stars because I LOVE Jersey Mike's subs. The girls working behind the counter were so-so when it came to customer service. Again, delicious subs! So much better than Jimmy John's and Which Wich (in my opinion)!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Jersey Mikes location in the past and it was ok, but it is clear there is new management. The store is very clean and rearranged for more seating. The staff was super friendly and my turkey sub Mikes's way was amazing. I am so glad to add this spot back to my lunch rotation. Also don't forget a cookie... the peanut butter cookies are amazing. If you have tried this location before but have not been lately give it another chance."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches period! Good bread and the quality of the meat is phenomenal. Food here is served consistent to other locations. This beas out Quiznos and subway hands down! Port of Subs is still only 2nd to Jersey Mikes... I just wish they had spinach and smoky cheddar cheese. 8 ("}
{"text":"If you like subs, you have to stop here while you're at the Vegas airport.  Yes, I know the slot machines are tempting but let's face it.....they never pay out.  Instead, spend your cash on a hot or cold sub.  These guys know how to make a philly steak sandwhich!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at two JMS and the food is always great. My wife likes their subs and she is hard to please when it comes to food. Everything is made fresh and the staff is always very helpful. My friends and go the eat at JMS once or twice a week."}
{"text":"I've only been to Jersey Mike's once before.  I stopped in this past weekend with my husband, and had a really decent sandwich.  I love that the meat is so fresh and flavorful (they slice it right as they are making your sandwich, so the texture is also vastly better than most other sandwich places).  My personal favorite is the roast beef.  They have a fairly decent selection of chips to go with your sandwiches, as well.  Service was quick and friendly.  This location has 2 large flat-screens, if that interests you.  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm from south NJ and what I miss the most is the great bread.  Jersey Mike's has the best bread over any other sandwich shops I've been to in Arizona and makes me feel like I am back east.  I recommend the white over the wheat personally.  I am a big fan of their hoagies and especially the roast beef and turkey sandwich with bacon.  Also their cheesesteak is very good.  I haven't had the tuna yet, but my friend has and he loved it.  Very delicious food here and I haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"First time visiting... which will be the last.  Sure, the store was clean and staff friendly, as you'd expect from any food service restaurant. But issues I found: Cost - over priced for what is being offered. I got a wrap and small drink at almost $11.  Tip Option - what does this place do any different than let's say Subway, Taco Bell, etc that warrants a tip?  And more than that, who does the tip go to?? There were three people involved with my experience there. It's a sub shop, tips are not typical.  Delivery - my wrap was so poorly wrapped that upon rolling it out of the far too large tinfoil wrapping, it unraveled. I ended up eating my wrap with a fork.  This place just doesn't stand up to other sub shops."}
{"text":"Never even knew there was a Jersey Mike's uptown till recently.  I may just have to start putting this into my rotation.  I came in on a Tuesday for the Super Tuesday deal ($6.50 for Sub/Chips/Drink).  It was pretty packed and I was told normally it's more crowded.  Note to self, get there early as possible.  That wasn't a problem though becuase they moved the line very well.  The problem comes in if you are looking to take a seat and eat it there.  Very limited seating area."}
{"text":"Hey Jersey Mikes, you make a mean Sub!  I'd never had one, but heard about them.  I got the grilled Pastrami Reuben on wheat, and I was kinda surprised how good it was.   I guess I was expecting subway, or jimmy johns.... or something.   It wasn't either of those places.   Its not a New York Deli by any means, but its pretty decent and fresh.    I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mikes and this location is the best! All the people are so nice and go out of their way to make your sub experience a good one. I've also witnessed them doing really nice things like throwing in a free drink for a first time customer, or give a free sub card for donating $3 to Phoenix Children's Hospital. Thanks for being awesome Jersey Mikes on central!!"}
{"text":"This is a newly opened location in Henderson, and I gave it a try for lunch.   It's pretty conveniently located in a shopping plaza, and there's plenty of parking.   The interior is fairly small (maybe 5-7 tables), and it was fairly busy during lunchtime.   They have a straightforward menu of hot and cold sandwiches and wraps. A cool thing is that their meats are sliced when you order rather than being vats of homogeneously pre-sliced lunch meat like Subway. They don't have as many bread selections (only about three) as Subway offers, though.   The staff were actually very welcoming and friendly and seemed to enjoy their work.   I tried the steak sandwich (hold the white American cheese) on white bread which came with grilled peppers and onions. Wow; delicious!! Hot, tender meat complemented perfectly by the peppers and onions.  Even the bread was good!    For cold sandwiches they don't have as huge a selection of vegetables and sauces as Subway (just lettuce, tomato, and onion were listed plus a red wine vinegar/olive oil dressing and \"spices\").   For about $2 more you can add chips and a fountain soft drink.   They do have a rewards program you can easily sign up for with just a phone number.   I was very impressed with my first visit to Jersey Mike's! Delicious food and very friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"I normally LOVE Jersey Mike's Subs, but I will never go back after our last experience. Two strands of hair was in my subs. Made me want to BARF! I've noticed that they do not wear any hair nets.  Very expensive sub to throw out after only two bites. YUK!"}
{"text":"Wow this jersey mikes has gone down hill!!!!!!!! I usually am a huge fan of coming here!!!!  Location really seems like it's run down it doesn't smell clean like the other locations . The only reason why they're getting a one star is because they don't have pickles at this location!! Whoever the owner is of this jersey Mike's location talk to whoever you get your pickles from a talk them your customers want pickles. even the girl behind the counter said that everybody is complaining that there's no pickles at this location.. Go do your job as an owner and get the damn pickles back"}
{"text":"I have visited this particular Jersey Mike's twice now while on lunch break. I was glad to see that they have online ordering so you don't have to wait in the monstrous line. However, there is no place designated for pick-up, and you either have to wait in the line or piss everyone off who is in the line. Awkward.  I would also suggest writing on the bag at least something showing what sandwich is inside so we don't have to play roulette for sandwiches. (As a co-worker picks the sandwich apart before realizing it is, in fact, MY sandwich.)  The sandwiches are substandard. The contents are nothing special.  I had a hot meatball sub the first time and a cold club sub this time. The roll, like noted by another reviewer, never holds stuff in. Also, too much oil and vinegar makes it soggy, and I have a texture thing...I digress.   I will say, contrary to other reviews, that the staff has always been friendly and courteous. The restaurant has always been clean and the service prompt."}
{"text":"With pleasure, I need to update my review.   Yesterday my fiancé and I received less then poor service, in which I made it publicly known on Yelp. In less then 24 hours the owner promptly responded with concern. The owner did not make his response public on Yelp, the owner personally messaged me. In this message not only did he apologize about the situation he made it clear this behavior was not acceptable and proper steps have been taken to address this behavior.   The owner did not ask me to reconsider my review nor ask me reconsider my rating.   The owner genuinely cares how this business is ran.  Because of the level of customer service the owner provided, I will resume business at this establishment.     UPDATE  I had to bring my 5 stars down to 3 due to our recent poor customer service we experienced.   If you wanna spare the story here is the end: if you plan to come after 8pm do yourself a favor and go next door to the pizza place, they will serve you better!   We walked at At 8:30pm, no line, 7 customers dining in eating. 2 guys were at the counter but refused to make eye contact with us and did not speak to us until 8:36pm. Very awkward.  I ordered my sub, made perfect. Then my fiancé ordered his, you could visibly see the bread he was cutting was rock hard, so my fiancé politely requested fresh bread, the associate rolled his eyes and grabbed fresh bread.  While making the sub the associate ran out of turkey he then slammed his hand down loudly and started clapping obnoxiously and loudly (The dining guest took notice and stared) the associate went in back and grabbed a new turkey. He continued making the sand which using body language and facial expression that showed he was truly annoyed and we were bothering him.   Once we were paying my fiancé couldn't keep it in any longer and said to the associate \"if you worked for me I would have fired you if you worked for me for clapping like that and rolling your eyes\" the associate replied with \"I now have to prep even more turkey\" in which my fiancé replied, \"but you get paid for that\"  the altercation ended at that. No apology, no ownership of his actions. This associate seems to be under the impression this behavior is acceptable.   I'm highly disappointed at this behavior. We did not walk in at 8:55pm or 9pm - Jersey Mikes should update their closing hours to 8:30pm if your going to treat people like that.    The food is great, my fiancé will continue to go here. I on the other hand will not reward this behavior.       Fresh food made quick!! Great quality of meat and friendly service!   Get it Mike's way!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Original Jersey Mikes hot sub. It was so fresh and tasty! I wish we had on near home!"}
{"text":"Way better than Subway and a bit more expensive too lol!  About once a month they send out coupons for two regular sub meals with drinks for $13.99.  Great deal and totally worth it.  They also slice the meat and cheese right there in front of you."}
{"text":"I love the Tuesday deals at this Jersey Mike's, great sandwich at a great price, with a friendly staff. I do wish they had the tomato basil wrap as an option in the online order though."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! They craft a great sandwich!!! One of the guys always ask if we want to take a picture before he wraps up his masterpiece!!! Cracks me up!!! I work in the same complex and my team & I are quite addicted to these subs... We try to change up our selections to try everything but getting stuck on the same one is so easy because they are so good!!! My team recommends to have it \"Mike's Way!\""}
{"text":"The staff at this location are very friendly! I went there one day to use my birthday coupon and the guy that took my order said \"I don't need to see it, I believe you.\" This location is right up the street from my house so I plan to go back often!"}
{"text":"First time at Jersey Mike's; When you order online,  they make your sandwich the exact opposite of what you ordered -  it's great!  We ordered an Italian and a Club,  no onion, no mayo,  add banana peppers and pickles. We received an Italian and a Turkey,  covered in onions and mayo,  no banana peppers or pickles on soggy bread.  Didn't discover it until I got home.  Never again.  I'll stick to Jimmy Johns or Goodcents."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sub place. They have amazing options and they are not afraid to load on the toppings. The tomatoes are always cut perfectly and extremely fresh. They cut the meat and cheese as you order each sub. The option to get a sub in a tub makes it feel cool to get a salad. I enjoy their tuna that they make in house. Mikes way is the way to go. They have a great blend of seasoning and oil which is exactly what all subs need."}
{"text":"This is my fifth return to this location the service is always great they acknowledge you finish with the previous customer and go for exactly what you want they always ask if you wanted to mikesway or do you want to do something else the meat is always fresh cut and the right amount of meat and cheeses per sandwich you just have the essentials so don't expect to have 4000 difference spoiled items like Subway does they have a grill they make real Philly cheesesteaks you have a choice of white or wheat lettuce and tomato onion pickles jalapeno banana and red peppers Mayo if you want it vinegar oregano black pepper salt everything is done right in the store there's a few booths  in the store finally nothing is left to dry up in the refrigerator after its cut nothing is cut until you come in and order it"}
{"text":"Love this place. So fresh and the bread is amazing. Turkey sandwich is great. Tried the tuna, it wasn't bad. My husband had the number 56 khauna Philly Cheese steak, that was awesome. Great friendly service. Glad it's  close to my house."}
{"text":"mmmmmmmm....   I friggin love this place.  The greatest damm subs in the whole world. straight from NJ.  I moved here about 4 years ago from NJ and missed this place so damm bad.  It is a little overpriced, but the fresh ingrediants are so far and above any other sub place out here it makes it worth it.  Whether you get a #11, a Cheesesteak, or a Turkey Provolone and Bacon, you will not go wrong.  Wow my mouth is watering right now."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me, knows I love Jersey Mike's. This place rocks just like all the other Jersey Mike's!!!"}

{"text":"Anyone who knows me, knows I love Jersey Mike's. This place rocks just like all the other Jersey Mike's!!!"}
{"text":"I hesitate to give them a 4 instead of a 5.... Since this place is amazing. They slice fresh deli meats and cheese right in front of you, their toppings are on point, and these guys couldn't be any faster. Talk about the bread!? I don't even have the words. Carbs on carbs on carbs (which is a fabulous thing).  This fast-casual joint makes sandwiches 'mikes way' upon request. Request it.   The only negative? They don't toast any if their subs, which may seem like a bummer at first, but trust me you'll get over it.  7-8 for taste 7 for atmosphere 7 for speed"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's has some of the best subs around. They are always fresh and good however the service was not good today. I waited in line for 10 minutes for them to prepare my sandwich. They got to do better than this"}
{"text":"Cool people makes a business. And this place has got them all...there is nothing worse than a rude person making your lunch..there needs to be more RYANs like this location has.thumbs up very clean and all the employees were top notch.its like  CHEERS.."}
{"text":"The subs here are awesome! I usually get the Philly cheese steak, which is spectacular, but the turkey, club sub, and Italian are good too. The only downside to this place is that it is expensive. One giant sub (without chips or a drink!) will cost you $13 to $14. It's worth it though."}
{"text":"Love the staff. They know my order, always have smiles and the food is just awesome. I always get the number 7, lettuce and mayo only. Maybe one day I'll be adventurous and try something new. I do wish that they still had potato salad and macaroni salad."}
{"text":"Love these girls!!! Once i walk in Cymbree and Angela get started on my order right away! Its amazing i dont even have to tell them my order they know it by heart even after seeing so many other customers. (: they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"This place is classic! Had a problem with my sandwich  here, made my complaint, i got a card and thought i could use it at any jersey mikes but was not accepted, so now, forget it!! Will never ever go back!"}
{"text":"Dont know how anybody can eat cheap cold cuts and soggy sandwiches but this place is awful!"}
{"text":"It was good, but expensive. I got the standard Italian but expected more for $12. It was almost a foot long, not quite though. Your better off going to a small business than this chain!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today, not impressed. Overpriced for a 1/2 sub, $10.20. The roast beef sub was dry, I've had better...stick with Firehouse, its better."}
{"text":"First time trying Jersey Mike's. I was sooooo excited to try the Bacon Ranch Chicken Cheese Steak and it was probably the worst sub I've EVER had. The bread was COMPLETELY soggy and ALL of the cheese stuck to the aluminum foil that the sub was wrapped in. First time and LAST time going here for sandwiches. Sticking to Subway."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my top choices for a quick great sandwich, but has since went south slowly. Their customer service and management is well below par and their quality of sandwich has suffered as well. It is sad, because I use to come here once a week, but I will now go elsewhere. Would not recommend this place, save your money and go to a better run jersey mikes or go across the street to subway and save a few dollars."}
{"text":"Great sub shop for delicious and quick sandwiches to go. Shout out to Kyle & John for very genuine and kind customer service!"}
{"text":"I go here quite often. They really have excellent subs. However, I never had the sandwich as I am always on a diet. Instead, I order the \"subs in a tub\".  I get the spicy red sauce. Whether in Chicago, Naperville or fabulous Las Vegas, Jersey Mike's is great!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best food option in terminal 1, C gates. FYI it's inside security, near gate C22.  Regular jersey mikes fare, though only one size sandwich available (regular 7\") and possibly missing some options. Also I think more expensive than normal.  In case you're not familiar with this suburban chain, it's a decent quality deli sandwich; order of magnitude better than subway. They also have a decent hot cheesesteak (beef or chicken).  My go to order is a #7 on wheat, mikes way plus spicy mustard. Mikes way definitely makes their sandwiches good, make sure to get it."}
{"text":"I ordered a catering order for a team lunch. The sandwiches were delicious!"}
{"text":"Ordered a turkey sub on wheat bread with extra tomatoes. Didn't get what I ordered, they skimped on the tomatoes and gave me regular white bread. Called to complain and the manager was like \"Oh Well\". Wrote to the company and they could care less too. Won't ever be back!"}
{"text":"I got the #9 giant and I feel that I was ripped off because they sliced my meat & cheese so thin you can see through it. I couldn't even taste the meat & cheese at all.  It was like having a lettuce, tomato and bread sandwich.  The tomatoes weren't fresh either, they were mushy. Also, the workers are dirty when it comes to handling your food.   I saw too many times the workers are handling the money with their gloves on and not changing them before they handle your food.  I travel for business all over the U.S. and this Jersey Mike's is far the worst! Where is the owner when all of this is going on? They are letting teenagers with their bad food handling practices run their sandwich shop into the ground. I will not recommend this Jersey Mikes to anyone. I want my $14.00 back!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday to pick up a couple of sandwiches. Ordered a turkey/provolone and a Big Kahuna with NO jalapenos. They got the turkey wrong and put together an Italian sub. Changed that out to turkey and all was right. I waited about 10 minutes for my hot sub. When I got it something told me to check it out (maybe the way they all were running around like chickens behind the counter). Sure enough it had jalapenos on it. They said they'd remake it. I waited another 10 minutes and was given the sandwich. The kid promised it was finally right. You guessed it, I took it home bit into it and sure enough it was full of jalapenos. WTH??? I took it back and demanded a full refund of my $30.81. This place is a disaster! Whoever the franchise owner is, needs to do some work in there."}
{"text":"I haven't been here ever since I left Vegas, however I enjoyed my lunches there.  I would go back if given the chance."}
{"text":"Loved it! got the #13 Italian, watched them slice the meats and prep the sandwich and the attention to detail is great fun to watch.  The result is yummy and a very good bargain - I could only eat half of the regular-size sub, so two lunches for $6.50 is a pretty good deal. great quality meats and the 'fixins' were perfect.  The second half was still good the next day-the whole thing kinda married itself and the flavors intensified.  I recommend the wheat roll - more sturdy. I wish they opened earlier in the morning, I would stop every week on my way to work to pick one up for lunch"}
{"text":"Happy to have a Jersey Mikes in Surprise, AZ. Been here 4 times and the have never disappointed! This location is extremely busy   Yet, they are very good at working through the crowds."}
{"text":"I've been here before and the service was on point. Yesterday for lunch, I along with another customer had to sit there and wait for several minutes because there was no one up front. Then when all three workers finally came up to the front they mixed up all of our orders and then didn't even put the right meat items or vegetables on the right sandwiches because all three of them were staring at the TVs like zombies because SportsCenter was on. I told the guy putting the veggies on my sandwich that I wanted everything on it and he still messed it up and only put lettuce and tomato on it. He was in slow motion and then the guy bagging it could barely put it in the bag because their attention was completely on the TVs / SportsCenter. Totally disappointing and unsatisfactory! SMH."}
{"text":"Service is always good the wait can be kinda long depending on when you come but it's worth it all the cheesesteaks are good"}
{"text":"The subs are pretty good. Better then subway but jimmy johns is better.  The staff seemed a bit overwhelmed even though the line wasn't that long. I think two online orders came on and that seemed to throw them off."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Jersey Mike's before. This was a whim stop because it is close by and we needed something quick around lunch time on Saturday. When we walked in my entire family gave me the stink eye because there had to be 20 people in line ahead of us. But service was fast and smooth and we were out in about 20 minutes. BONUS! They have gluten free bread! They are incredibly careful while making gluten free items so there is no cross-contamination.  My husband had the Italian and my daughter and I had turkey everyone loved their meals. We will return."}
{"text":"I have been eating Jersey Mike's subs for 25 years starting back in NJ when it was a small, local franchise. Back then the subs were packed with fresh cut cold cuts and tasted great. Since they expanded nationwide a few years ago the quality has fallen and the amount of meat has shrunk precipitously as the price has risen. Now it seems you get a nice sub roll with a whole lot of lettuce. Today I split a turkey with provolone with my wife. For a giant which is basically a whole sub cost over $14. No chips or a drink, just the sub. The meat was sliced so thin I doubt it could get much thinner. I doubt I will be visiting Jersey Mike's anymore. I still have the memories of what it used to be."}
{"text":"I never have been to a jersey mikes before. The other day I went in to see what it was all about. It was so good I just got back from there today. The bread is so Delicious! The food is fresh they cut it right in front of you."}
{"text":"Great customer service from the entire staff.  Fast, friendly and clean.  Their smiles and the fantastic food will bring me back soon"}
{"text":"Great food awesome staff. Hoo has good recommendations and a big smile.   Try it mikes way and boy are they quick."}
{"text":"I've lost the love for this place. It became apparent today as I watched my sandwich being made. What once was a sandwich made by a friendly face with a smiling attitude was instead made by an emotionless grumpy female drone that made the sandwich so fast a forcibly that she didn't cut the bread in half, she tore it by trying to go faster then the knife itself. As she cut the meat, she simply slapped it down on the bread so it was quite literally meatless on the ends....not one of the three ladies there smiled or made me feel welcome. This visit had the personal touch of texting someone you just met to go on a date with you...."}
{"text":"First time at this chain. Long line but got our order quickly. Good tasting food and decent prices. Totally worth it"}
{"text":"Visited this Jersey Mike's for something different and was really surprised at the wonderful service that received from the staff. The restaurant was busy when we came in and therefore was not as clean as usually excellent excellent expect, but while we were eating I saw the staff tidying up. It is always great to eat at a clean table and a must for me; don't care for others germs. We found a table that was clean so they seem to clean it between the rush.   I ended up ordering the philly steak and cheese and it was made fresh, but I did not know that it had onions on it. When I was ordering the cashier confirmed my order for the small sandwich with only meat and cheese, but it had onions and I will not eat it at all. I brought it to the cashiers attention when she was free of customers and she happened to be the manager. She also made sure it had no onions and actually I watched the cook remake the sandwich so I was so elated. The sandwich was so worth it."}
{"text":"I had the provolone, Cappicoal and Ham Sub \"Mikes Way\", you get what you pay for the quality is good but the prices are high so if you're on a budget then Subway might be more your place. Over all it was yummy but nothing unique about the subs. near my home We have Claros Italian Market which is better and much lower in price. Still no places beats Titos Market In South El Monte."}
{"text":"Came here a few nights ago on my way home from work.  Had to be right around 8:30PM and the staff was clearly ready to get out of there, (They close at 9PM) and I can completely understand. I work 14 hour shifts so when its time to go i'm more than ready.  I walked up to the counter and the guy working told me it was going to be a couple of minutes because they had already prepared to close...  I understand you guys are probably exhausted from working part time making sandwiches but just because you were hoping to close early doesn't mean you need to give attitude to customers coming in close to closing time.   When a store closes at 9PM that's when you start closing procedures not 45 minutes before. You also don't try and make customer's feel bad for forcing you to do your job.  There's a Which Which across the street i would suggest trying them, because the staff there is always friendly despite the time you arrive."}
{"text":"Went last weekend about 1130 am after waiting in at long we were told they have just ran out of Philly meat. OK that happens. We went back today at 10 when they open ordered the Philly and chicken bacon ranch to go we live about 3 miles away. Get home the bread on the chicken  bacon ranch is super soggy and the bacon is totally rancid. Super bad. Must be old bacon or from yesterday had the husband try it as well and he agreed.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Woman that was working was on point. Asked the guy who made our sandwiches what they were and he said \"I don't know what they are\" she also asked him for the ticket for the order. He said \"I don't have it\". Must suck to have to carry that guy through a shift. My food was drenched in sauce, basically a soup sandwich. My wife got the first cheese steak I've ever seen with no peppers or onions on it. I think there was one sliver of vegetable. $23 for a soggy giant sub and a regular with half the ingredients."}
{"text":"Sorry, but if you're not going to honor the coupons your company sends out then you need to change the name of your business.  If you don't want to be a Jersey Mike's then becomes something else.  It was very slow service at dinner time.  Not enough workers to keep the line down.  I will not be back until the new ownership honors the coupons printed with their address."}
{"text":"I'm generally not a fan of most chain sandwich stores because I feel like I can make it a thousand times better and healthier at home; but sometimes convenience takes priority and then you will see me at Jersey Mike's.    JM make juicy, flavorful sandwiches and they are close to where I live, which adds another convenience point to the list.  They also have wraps, plus you can order the sandwich as a salad. Staff is friendly and fast.  The place is small but always clean."}
{"text":"We order from this store about once a month. They are usually prompt and the sandwiches are really good. The one delivery that took forever they were very upfront with a driver issue and they bought us sodas and chips."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. For the price point and the amount that comes on the sandwich, not impressed. I got a 56, and I felt like I literally got 3 jalapeños and maybe a few mushrooms. My partner got a 31? Chicken California. She was not happy with the chicken. It was worth trying and a few coworkers are interested in trying you all out. Just not for us."}
{"text":"I am not a big sub sandwich eater.  I've tried many of them - Subway, Quizno's, Jason's Deli, Eegee's......etc.   Besides Eegee's (which is really good), I just thought they were all decent sandwiches - some better than others.  But I have had Jersey Mike's a handful of times now, and their sandwiches are much better than the others.  Just get it \"Mike's Way\" and enjoy the tasty food you receive.  But just as importantly, the customer service I have received at this store has been impeccable.  The people are always very friendly and patient and that makes a huge difference to me.    I must say that their sandwiches are a little pricier than others.  I get their \"Giant\" size (ok - so I'm a big eater....) at it runs about 12 bucks...yikes!   But as delicious as it is, it's worth it.  Try it - you won't be sorry..."}
{"text":"I grew up in Jersey close to the original stores and love this place. I'm glad they are continuing to expand and grow their locations! I usually get a #7 and this location does a good job on the sandwich. Unfortunately the staff was goofing around a bunch  and didn't really ask me for what toppings I wanted. But hey, the subs are worth it. Apple Pay support is really nice too!"}
{"text":"I love me a pastrami sandwich and they did a great job grilling it up!  Plus they signed me up for the loyalty club, for which I only need my phone number. They said the sign-up came with a free cookie, then they went in the back and got me two cookies fresh out of the oven!  This level of courtesy caused me to investigate Jersey Mike's website where I learned that the culture they are cultivating is exactly what I saw today.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast, I had high expectations that this place would be a great restaurant to try a cheese steak. I could tell the experience wouldn't be great as soon as I got the response to my questions, \"what kind of cheese comes with it?\". American cheese. Really? Really folks? Provolone is classic cheese for cheese steaks. South Philly icons aside, it should be provolone.  Then the sub comes. It's hot. Boy it's really hot. Not sure if the bun was microwaved, but it sure tasted that way. Most likely it was the super hot contents steaming up the sub roll to the point that the roll gets chewy and rubbery. Yuck. Not good eats. The inside of the sandwich, however, was pretty good.   I'll definitely give this place another try, but with a cold sub. I recommend folk steer clear of the hot ones. I'll update my review once I try a different sub."}
{"text":"We live in Norterra and hadn't tried this place. As with most smaller chain sandwich shops, it's usually a ton of bread and some stuff inside. I don't want to waste my money and be disappointed.  Jersey Mike's is pricey. You're looking at about $20 for two people. But, the sandwiches were great an very fresh ingredients. Since my first visit, we've been back several times for lunch.  Try their cookies."}
{"text":"Meh. It's like something that will do the job in a pinch. I do like that they slice the meat when you're ordering, but wouldn't mind more cheese offerings, like cheddar or jack. And I'm not a big fan of their bread... it's sorta heavy and almost flavorless, so it's nice that they now have a rosemary-parmesan option. And i understand the quality of the sandwich build is random, but i want everyone to care about every single bite.  This was going to be a 3 star review, but they get a bonus for having pretty good cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"I probably should wait until I try this place out again before writing this review, but my first experience was so bad (food) that I'm not even sure I even want to give it another chance. Really sad since I've been wanting to try Jersey Mike's for a long time and when I finally get around to it, it was a letdown.   Stopped by last weekend and my first impressions were great. The inside was very clean and organized. The floors were cleaned, tables wiped down, trash area clean, and the drink station was clean, organized and filled with all the necessities. As we entered we were greeted by the friendly ladies working behind the counter. The lady making the sandwiches gave suggestions and answered questions we had.   Jersey Mike's offer Hot and Cold subs as well as wraps. They offer the subs in three different sizes Mini, Regular, and Giant. All cold subs include \"Mike's Way\", which is with onions, lettuce, tomatoes, red wine vinegar, olive oil blend, and spices. And you can choose between a plain, wheat, and tomato tortilla for your wrap. Add a small chip and a drink for $2.69 for a 22 oz or $2.89 for 32 oz drink. Their kid's meal is $4.49 and includes and drink and a cookie.   My guest got the #13 - The original Italian regular sub. This comes with Provolone cheese, ham, prosciuttini, cappacuolo, salami and pepperoni. He made it \"Mike's Way\" minus the tomatoes and added Mayo. Cost $8.49. I decided on the Buffalo Chicken Signature wrap on a tomato basil wrap. It came with grilled chicken in a spicy buffalo sauce, melted American cheese, lettuce, tomato, and blue cheese dressing. This cost $7.99.  My problem with this place was how they made my wrap. They put so much lettuce and tomato into the wrap that she couldn't roll the wrap. Everything was busting out the ends and with all the sauce they added to it, my wrap was so soggy by the time I got to my table!! I picked it up and everything fell out of the wrap and they didn't have any forks for me to eat it with, so I ended up having to toss most of it. Very, very disappointed. Sure, I'm glad they give you plenty, but it was ridiculous how much they put in the wrap. If you can't close it, it's too much! On top of that, the \"Mike's Way\" with the vinegar and olive oil just added to the sogginess of the wrap. If I come back, I'll just stick to a sub and opt out of the \"Mike's Way\"."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped for a quick sandwich before Christmas shopping tonight at the Camelback location. We are Jersey Mike's fans, tonight was the service was on point! Chad was behind the counter by himself and was amazing. I have never had such great customer service before. He engaged in conversation with us and was so professional and friendly.  You don't see much anymore in young employees. Sandwiches were great as usual but Chad made it a great experience! A big shout out to him....."}
{"text":"Always a great sandwich.  Staff is friendly.  Lie this place.  Very clean and fast.  Love the new bread"}
{"text":"I love this place, they always have the rarest roast beef just how I like!! Gary and all his staff are  always so friendly.   I've also tried the number 13, it's great too!"}
{"text":"So after my last visit to Jersey Mikes I called them out for serving a sandwich at the end of the night on bread that was as hard as a rock. Just because a person buys a sandwich near closing time doesn't mean they shouldn't  have a sandwich made just as fresh as the person buying one when you 1st open the doors for the day. The same night these sandwiches were bought I called them out on it and was told by the night lead staff,\"we wrote your name down, come on in anytime and we'll replace your food\" Now part of the issue was I should have went back right away to redeem my families sandwiches but instead we waited some time and today they tell me/us that they have no clue what we were talking about and we would need our receipt in order to have the meal replace. The cold part wasn't the fact we were told we needed the receipt, what got me is the fact the man...the lead staffs delivery of the message from the GM \"my general manager says you need to bring in your receipt in order to have your meal replaced\" and the man walks away behind a closed door before anything could have been said leaving the man at the register to deal with this concern! If that move wasn't escape avoidance, I don't know what it was! There was no need to bring that poor guy into it so All I/we did was walk away and watched from the car to see when we would come back out. As we approached our car you could see him waiting and watching from the window for us to drive off.  WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING THANK YOU FOR LEAVING A BAD TATSTE IN OUR MOUTHS!"}
{"text":"Needed this in Harrisburg. They slice meat and cheese fresh for each sandwich so tastes much better than subway. Just a sub chain but one of the best."}
{"text":"I absolutely love jersey mike's subs! But this location lately is either short handed or something. I came in today and there was a group of people in front of me, people walking in with call in orders, the phone kept ringing... Probably took 15 min to get the food.  Service used to be much better here."}
{"text":"This place was great! Colin, Larry and Christina were so helpful, attentive, sweet and gave the best recommendations on what to Order For us first timers. They delivered our sandwiches to our table right away and cleaned up as soon as they saw we were finished. Thank you for the great service! Will come back when back working in vegas! :)"}
{"text":"First off, service is always awesome when I'm here. They slice the deli meat and cheese to order, more brownie points from me.  Store is nicely kept, lobby is always clean. Food line is nice and tidy which is a major pet peeve of mine. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Im the type of person that if I find something I like, I will eat it so many times in the first few months until I get sick of it. Thats where I am with jersey Mikes. I like it alot , it reminds me of the way subs are made in Brooklyn NY where I grew up. I get the same thing over and over. Turkey sub mikes way. Ill continue to go there every week sometimes twice a week until i cant eat it no more."}
{"text":"I have to give a huge shout out to this Jersey Mikes location!! They came into my business to introduce themselves and gave all of my employees free meal cards. I have always been a Jimmy Johns girl myself - but I was highly impressed with their kindness and wanted to see what they were about. I went in earlier this week to redeem my free meal card and I've already gone back for my third visit!! First off, I have to say their customer service here is amazing!! The first day I went in they had a line almost out of the door and you could tell they were bustin butt busy  - but again, nothing but smiles and kindness. They were excited to help each and every person without being overwhelmed. Second, holy amazing ingredients!! SO fresh!! From the bread to toppings, just holy smokes.. Fantastic. And their price, extremely fair. They load you up with more meat and toppings for cheaper than other sandwich places do for twice the cost. I may have been a Jimmy Johns girl before, but Jersey Mikes has me for good now!! P.s. Get your sandwich \"Mikes way\" - perfection. Love it!! Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"We stopped at the new Jersey Mike's location on McKnight road in lieu of our other usual lunch spots because we heard good things about the chain and it was one of the first days they were open.  This  location definitely didn't impress.  There was one person in front of us waiting for their sub, but the girls at the counter just kind of stared at us for a while before asking what we wanted.  We ordered, waited forever for our sandwiches to be made, and paid.  Holy cow, are these some expensive sandwiches!  Almost $20 for two and drinks, and one was veggie.  This is one of those places that relentlessly tries to up-sell you a bottle of water if you order water as a beverage, which annoys me.  (I'm not totally cheap, but Pittsburgh's finest is A-OK with me, thanks! BPA-free and better for the environment.  Okay--and free!)  My sandwich was TOTALLY DRENCHED in oil.  Like, almost inedible.  By the time I unwrapped it at the table it was basically a pile of lettuce and goo.  My husband says his was okay (he custom-ordered, and didn't get it \"Mike's Way\" like I did), but not as good as DiBella's or even Subway.  Sooooo, maybe this place was just having a hiccup as it first opened.  But with the plethora of sandwich options available in the 'burgh, I don't think I'll be giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"Their Philly cheesesteak is always my favorite no matter what city I may be in. Dig it!"}
{"text":"People here are friendly and made the sandwiches fast. Love Jersey Mikes and always a good lunch spot when I am on the road for work."}
{"text":"2 things:  1) Ive had better sandwiches at Subway. Their bread is stale, meat is dry, and if you get a sandwich \"Mike's way\" they *smother* it in oil and vinegar.  2) There were ants all over the drink counter and IN THE NOZZLES. My husband pushed the button for Sprite and got Sprite w/ a power boost of live ants in his glass.  Dirty place, bad food."}
{"text":"Welcome to Downtown!  Finally a little area with a few great chains.  They also have PARKING!  The parking is located on the east or south side of the building.  We grabbed Jersey Mike's on a Sunday afternoon and took it home to eat.  They are the best subs we have had.  They are packed with meat and cheese.  Might be little pricier then blimpie, but with it due to the over load of meat!  Check out a Jersey Mike's near you!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service and the staff is professional. Jordan is also a great and friendly manager that makes you feel welcome in the place and right at home. I love the subs and will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is always great, but it has to be Mike Style.  It hasn't changed since I was in high school. It's always quality and always great you can never go wrong with Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"The employees were very friendly, I went in yesterday after we'd (8.19.2017) to get my husband and his coworker a sandwich but I was waiting on a text back asking what kind of toppings they wanted and the two gentlemen behind the counter patiently waited. I made a joke like comment about waiting on men and she laughed and made one back! It was nice to have people that actually act like they're happy to be at work!"}
{"text":"Love this location! I come here all the time and always receive amazing service! The employees are amazing and always are so nice and friendly. Thank you Jersey Mikes for making my lunch break awesome!"}
{"text":"I guess I am nit picking if I order a salad with meat on it and you don't cut the meat I will need a knife to cut it if you don't provide a knife I can not eat so I can wait for you to cut it or make my appointment...last  money I spend here"}
{"text":"Love Jersey Mikes but they are playing death metal throughout the store. I really think this is out of touch. Does the owner know?  11 AM Monday. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this location.   When I walked in, we were not greeted at all and we stood there while she made a sandwich and she still didn't acknowledge that we were there. Poor customer service already! Really! She was way to distracted on talking to someone else in the store she knew, didn't care about me as the current customer! She rushed through my order and I had to repeat several times because she just wasn't listening."}
{"text":"the service was impeccable, they're all so very nice. I just wish my sandwich itself was more filling, but I think that was my fault because I didn't say 'mikes way'. but overall they were perfect."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best sub I have ever had!! Lol I know, I know... It's just a sandwich right?! WRONG!!! These guys make amazing sandwiches and they taste great to boot!! Yea, they're a little on the expensive side but it's totally worth it!! I LOVE IT HERE!! The staff is friendly and they're fast with their hands too!!! That subway just won't do it for me anymore!! Lol This place is friggin great!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Besides the best east coast style bread on a sub, the meats, cheeses, and vegetables are hand sliced and on a whole different level than other sandwich places. Worth the extra buck, in fact, it's worth several more so show some love to the staff. Get the #9! The roast beef is amazing and I've heard good things about their hot sandwiches too."}
{"text":"Sad. I know people have bad days. But I walked in, no one was in line and got nothing. No smile. No greeting. The guy behind the counter was more worried about scraping the lettuce off the cutting board than greeting me or taking my order. The guy who adds toppings. Same thing. I move up to the register, and still nothing.   So I keep walking. Out the door I went. Next door to them was a new restaurant called Soulfish Poke. Looks like I have a new favorite lunch place."}
{"text":"Found out this place finally open so some friends and I here at the office decided to give it a try.... Ordered online... very quick and easy.... Order was ready when requested.... just to add... I had an order of 11 sandwiches.... As there where packing all the sandwiches in a single large bag, I was going to order a drink, and the kind gentleman offered it to me for free.. nice!!.... Got back to the office and everyone was happy... all sandwiches where made to perfection and as requested... nothing missing nothing extra... The Philly was perfect, but I would suggest that you order extra cheese on it if you like'em cheesy.... we will definitely be returning in the near future.."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous, come on it's in Vegas off the strip and they don't accept $100 bills!! Make me wait in line to order then tell me or sorry we don't take $100. I know she probably just ate my poorly made sandwich anyways. Poor service!! She didn't even have a smile on her face. Major attitude. Will not be back!!!"}
{"text":"I've always liked Jersey Mike's. There is something about a \"wet\" sub that intrigues me. Whenever I go I get it Mike's Way.  The service is really good too. I like that they slice the meat and cheese there (even if the turkey doesn't naturally come in a log shape) as it makes me feel like it is just a little fresher than the other guys.  Definitely give it a go."}
{"text":"Wonderful subs here! My favorite is the #13 Original Italian, prepared \"Mike's Way\" PLUS cherry peppers & a little mayo --LOVE! Relieved when they opened this location as I boycott the chain across the street (initials J.J.) due to its namesake being an unapologetic trophy hunter manchild. Thank you to Jersey Mike's for giving us a delicious alternative  that we can feel good about supporting."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an online order and the service was fast & friendly! Delicious & fresh ingredients. Order accuracy was on point. Didn't even mind driving to this location after first going to another location for pick-up by mistake. Do wish the subs weren't priced quite so high, but I have no complaints about their quality! Thanks for a yummy dinner!"}
{"text":"Only people working Were two girls blonde and brunette on Saturday September 17. They were extreme melt rude and clearly didn't want me there. I'm a 22 year old girl so I get wanting to chat with your friend at work especially when the boss isn't there but at least do your job when 1 customer comes in without being rude and showing me I'm clearly interrupting girl time."}
{"text":"NOTE: I've only visited the JMS's location at FLW/101, but they HAVE to be all the same, right?!?  To give you a little back story, my BFF is a legit Jimmy John's fan. And, I am not (anymore). Ever. In order to convince my friend of the extra drive to the closest Jersey Mike's and what they do to their various sandwiches, and how you can see them slice meat/cheese for your sandwich, I had prepared a stellar PowerPoint presentation including an essay (which I narrated) on why this would be good for her.  BFF (stubborn, mind you) finally relented and weakly mumbled that she'd at least try Jersey Mikes, blah blah... *VICTORY*!!! **NOTE: No presentation, speech, etc was a part of my convincing - it did cross my mind though.  Since I obtained that challenging \"buy-in\" from bestie, I prayed to all entities that this location would be similar to my beloved N Scottsdale location. If this joint didn't deliver greatness, it would just be a bowl full of dick soup. And, no one wants that... do they?  We park and enter the establishment in wrinkled sweats/hoodie/10-year old Uggs with holes around toes (my attire) and bestie with PJ bottoms/tank top (hers) and a general \"don't mess with me - it's been a long night\" scowl across her head. No one even put makeup on. I can't recall if even a brush was run through my head. Prob... not. I did brush my teeth though! Hmmm, if not, at least I had gum that I was masticating and swirling around...  I assertively started ordering my #13 (Original Italian) and yelped out that for damn sure I wanted it \"Jersey Mike style\"!  My BFF was a tiny skittish and indecisive with her selections and candidates. To help, a male server offered and fed her some exotic meat. The meat was good but had a kick. We were making progress...  After hemming and hawing, intertwined w/my schticky jokes and my friend's, and then the male server's fun time talk, a sandwich had been selected! BFF took the plunge and did it MIkey's way too! I praised her and promised she would never look back. :)  The server (probably low 20's) was very effervescent and flirty. It was contagious. He got a kick out of us so he threw free cookies at us, as if we were 3 years old with chubby cheeks and dimples. I didn't care, I scooped up the bootie and bid him adieu! Well done - be back!!!  Note- bestie dug her Sammy and suggested we go back to see cutsie server so she can throw some game down. Now, that's a success!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for first time last night on an impulsive whim. It was getting late, and I needed fuel fast.  So glad I did stop! I ordered the Turkey/Provolone on wheat - Jersey Mike style (w/seasoning and oil, etc). Didn't look hugely appetizing so I was a tad apprehensive. Got back home, and wow... such a symphony of flavor and textures! Generous w/their meat portions (they slice it before your very eyes after you have ordered) and excellent bread recipe.  Maybe since I went Jersey style, I added mega sodium amounts, but it was on the salty side. That obviously didn't stop me from 86-ing my Sammy. ;)  Fast and fun customer service w/smiles!  I'll certainly be a regular here. Great job!"}
{"text":"Was running late to eat at home and then my flight was delayed when I arrived to the airport, so bring that a man's gotta eat I stopped by Jersey Mike's.  I got the #17 Philly Steak with Onions and Green Peppers, I had them add some white american cheese which melted into every crack and crevasse in the sandwich...  Alot of sandwich to finish off, I highly recommend this one!"}
{"text":"If you like sub sandwiches and Fox News blaring on all the televisions, this is the place for you. I took mine to go and it was--as usual--a tasty sandwich. I've had more outgoing/friendly service there in the past, but it was fine this time. The chip selection is better than I recall Subway having, and I prefer Jersey Mike's sandwiches to Subway, but they are more expensive and further away for me. I may return, but not in the near future."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Philly cheesesteaks I've ever had in AZ. The employees are always nice and on point, (I have never had any mistakes on my orders even when called in). I also love the turkey wrap with bacon. Every sandwich has a healthy portion of meat and the bread is always fresh. If you haven't tried Jersey Mike's yet you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Great little sub shop! So here's our money saving hack of that day; order what ever sub you want in the \"giant\" size, then split it with your partner . You each end up with a huge portion and save yourself nearly $2 in the process. Also, if it's your 1st Time in check in using yelp and you will receive a coupon for a free cookie! Such a deal ."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for Phillies in downtown. Even though it is a chain, these guys have it right. Cleanest sandwich place in the downtown area. Keep it up gang!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!! After listening to my brother sing the praises of Jersey Mike's, I decided to try them. There was one customer at the counter and maybe another eating at a table during my visit. So they were not very busy. After several (5-10) minutes of not being acknowledged, I was finally greeted with a very terse and unprofessional greeting. I immediately left. If you act like you're doing me a favor by taking my order, I won't be back. Teach your employees some customer service skills!"}
{"text":"Great sub shop! Fresh cut meats to order and their delish homemade Italian style vinegar Dressing really makes this sandwich off the hook, tasty!!!  My favorite was the signature sub, and I liked you could order reg or gigantic, if you want to share! :)  Seriously, one of the best subs I ever had! Busy place but the line moves fast even if out the door. When in the Cleveland area this is a MUST stop lunch stop! I wish jersey mikes would come to Seattle!"}
{"text":"Jersey mikes is east coast but accessible in AZ! The sandwiches are amazing and i love the soda choices!"}
{"text":"This review is for the customer service only.  3 words TRAINING TRAINING TRAINING!!  They had enough staff on Sunday Oct 2 but each person was more confused than the next and had ugly attitudes toward each other.  Very unprofessional and I even said \"good luck\" to the people behind me."}
{"text":"Really yummy subs! I love that they mail out coupons once in awhile. Get it \"mikes way\" for sure! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Im not from this area so when I come around Phoenix I always have to stop at a Jersey Mikes since there are very few in So Cal.  I can't wait till they open more where I live cause you can tell the quality is unmatched compared to Subway and Quiznos."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with this location but today I placed an online order and 2/3 sandwiches I ordered were COMPLETELY wrong!! One sandwich specifically said no cheese because I am allergic but when I opened it I found about eight slices of cheese!! First when I walked in one woman confirmed that I had an online order then the other (wearing brown pants and glasses) told me to go to the back of the line. (When on the app it says to go to the front) I said \"oh I actually have an online order!\" And she said \"yes that's why I wanted you to go to the back.\" Then she threw two cups in the bag and left it on the counter for me. Got home and to found the sandwiches to be wrong, called and they said to bring the sandwiches back to confirm if I was telling the truth or not. Absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Gluten Free was the key for us.  We have a family member with Celiac that hadnt had a sub in two years.  Heard they had GF bread.    Our family member was really excited and thrilled to have 'soft' GF bread.  Which is almost impossible at home or anywhere.  Service was awesome.  Price high, but worth it we thought.  We get home and stare at two coupons in the mail.  Thats the way life works.    Just found our new favorite place to have GF food.   Thats hard to do.   Good job Jersey Mikes."}
{"text":"They freshly slice your meat and cheese right in front of you like in a deli so it's really fresh unlike subway which has preservatives on each side of the meat. They also roast their beef in store and cook fresh bacon on the skillet! Best sub place"}
{"text":"Good fresh subs. I like that Meat and cheese are cut in front of you. Work-mates swear by the tuna, and I've not found a hot sandwich on the menu I didn't like. Ask for a sandwich \"Mike's way\" for all the fixings.   The place is new to the area (opened late December 10) and it didn't hurt my impression of the place that they partnered with a local elementary school to celebrate opening. Add to that fact that the manager and employees remember me though I only go every other week and greet me warmly each time.  Fresh ingredients and a \"local place\" feel - a great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"As a general rule, I'm not a fan of subs. I'm more of a hot meal person. But I decided to give the new Jersey Mike's a try since it was on my way to work and I had a coupon for a free sub. Free food always tastes better than paid for food.  I was pleasantly surprised upon entering this fine establishment. It was clean, uncrowded and the staff was alert and friendly; not like the listless nubes they have at Subway, staring into space wondering where they went wrong in life and mentally planning your demise. Jersey Mikes hires future CEOs. The kind of people that will take over major corporations while briefly reflecting on a simpler time spent making sandwiches for assholes like me.  I ordered the Supreme Club, which is basically a club sandwich plus roast beef. They have a production line setup and my sub was made within 30 seconds. I got it \"Mike's Way\" which means they put lettuce, tomato, onions and a special vinaigrette with herbs on it. (Mine was no onions, add pickles). I exchanged my coupon for the sub and my happy ass was out the door. I got to work, threw my lunch in the fridge and went about my business.  I retrieved my east coast sub 2 hours later and was disappointed to discover that the bottom bun was mostly mush, due to grease seepage. Bummer. It did not, however, affect the taste. The sub was still delicious. Best cold meal I've had in awhile. I recommend eating right away if you opt for the special vinaigrette.  Kudos Jersey Mike's. I will be back with my coupons. And my opinions."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They receive a 5 star rating in more than one way! Starting out, their store is very clean and neat. Also the service was fantastic! People were smiling and cheerful!  Now time for the nitty gritty...the subs...AMAZING! They slice the meats and cheeses right in front of you! Oh and their sizes are large! The Giant Club Deluxe is enough for 2 meals! Definitely get your sub \"the Mike's way\" and join there rewards program. It seems to be a great deal!"}
{"text":"Friendly, helpful and polite staff!   Hangry me stopped in during a road trip. I appreciated the sandwich maker's nice attitude. They helped me understand the store's offerings. Food was fine. Similar to, if not better than, Subway. But the service definitely made for a nice pit stop."}
{"text":"I'm literally obsessed with Jersey Mike's now! I'll never go to subway again. Went in and 2 guys named Ron and Randy I believe were at the counter. They immediately greeted me with a hello and asked how my day was going. They got me to try my turkey sandwich \"Mike's way\" and now I'm hooked. They'll definitely keep me coming back! Excellent customer service and super delicious."}
{"text":"Good Philly steak sandwich. I would recommend this place. Sure beats Subway and Ports of Subs."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches & fast service. The few times I've gone there's always been a line, so you know it must be good! A new favorite lunch spot for our office."}
{"text":"Totally in love with Jersey Mike's. It's my first choice when I want a sub. Love that they fresh slice the cold cuts and cheese to order. Very simple ordering process. My usual is the mini #7 turkey and provolone. I always ask for \"Mike's Way\", which is lettuce, tomato, onion, oil & vinegar, spices. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My bread was very dry but my husband and brother liked theirs so I give them 2 stars for that reason.  $28 for 3 sandwiches was too much.    I won't be a return customer."}
{"text":"Ordered #56 got chicken instead of steak ... they gave me steak anyway... told them it was wrong .. the lady at the register said ok they'll fix it .. the guy who made it came out and said I thought you wanted it but I will fix it... some tall dude named Steve cane out and pointed to the board and said #55 is chicken not #56 .. and walked off ... very poor customer service ... guess if my skin was the same as his ... maybe I would have gotten better service... want eat their again"}
{"text":"Just do this: go to Jersey Mike's, (I like this location particularly), go and order a #56.  Steak, mushroom, jalapenos, some kind of cheese that just makes the whole sandwich a chessey, delicious mess!  FANTASTIC!  By the way, I went to Jersey Mike's website, had a bit of difficulty but got 2 responses from Mike's: management AND franchisee. Nice.  They care.  WHAT A GREAT SANDWICH!"}
{"text":"The employees will run this place out of business, came there at 10:40 when they open at 10:00 and sign is not on, tell them the signs not on and they say \"ok?\" One employee stayed on her phone the whole time. These employees make a bad atmosphere and make you want to get out of there on purpose so they don't have to work."}
{"text":"This location never has my online order ready. The reason I order ahead is so I don't have to wait. Instead, I get the pleasure of watching them completely clear the line before making my order without so much as a sorry. If it isn't ready when I come in, then shouldn't they stop and make mine right away? I wait until the quoted time has passed before I even attempt to pick up my order. This happens every time I come to this location. I love Jersey Mikes, but I'll drive a little further to go to a different store."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Jersey Mike's subs. When we found out this one was opening right around the corner, we were both ecstatic. They always have excellent customer service and amazing food. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because I do feel it is a little bit pricey there."}
{"text":"I was in this shop on 11/10/17, around 12:00pm.  I came in there was a couple in front of me placing their order I was next a line was then forming behind me the couple ordered and I was standing  there waiting to order, after a few minutes the clerk ask me my order I gave it to him and stepped to the side.  I stood there ad I watched about ten people that were behind me order and receive their food and I was still standing there.  After about 20min the same clerk ask me what did I order, at this point I am very angry.. I don't want to call racism but being the only person of color in the shop it sure has that component,  he then gave me the wrong guy order and had to make the order again after about 48mins I got my sandwich, as I stated to walk out the couple that was in front of me had finished their lunch and said to me what happened  you were right behind us, that was not right for them to treat you like that, I said I said yeah I know in 2017 right."}
{"text":"Had the big kahuna, very tasty. Kind of pricey (2 big kahunas and a water $30) but I mean most things are over priced in the airport anyway."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sandwich shop! I've been to almost every sandwich shop in Tempe and none of them come close to delivering what Jersey Mike's does.  The quality of the ingredients and the extra care they put into each sandwich is what sets it apart. The lettuce is thinly sliced and never contains lettuce cores. The tomatoes are always red and rarely do I see a green one. The meat is freshly sliced. The bread is never hard or broken, it is baked perfectly. They also have hot subs and I am not talking about microwaved subs. The sub sizes are spot on. I've been to places where their smallest sub could easily feed a whole family. When they apply the condiments they don't over do it, except for maybe oil and vinegar. You can get a mini sub, chips, and a drink for about $7-$8 so it is definitely is lunch doable.  Everybody there is friendly and asks how my day is going. I used to work at Subway years ago and make sandwiches and know a good sandwich artist when I see one and all these people do an excellent job.  I don't know what is wrong with people and what would make them say Subway is better. Subway is like the McDonalds of sub shops. They don't care if you get broken bread, or if your sandwich is caked with mayo, or if the sandwich is so full of condiments that it can't be closed let alone fit in your mouth. Also Subway smells and don't be surprised if you smell like it after you leave.  When this place first opened they gave out free cookies a few times. I don't know if they still do, but it is always nice to see a place that appreciates it's customers. If you go during lunch there is usually a line, but it moves pretty fast. Also if indoor seating gets full, there are seats out back."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Jersey Mike's subs. I would love to say that I've had a variety of their sandwiches, but I always have to go with the Original Italian - Mike's Way with mayo. Red pepper relish on the side.  The people that work at this location are very friendly as well. Yummmmm sandwiches :)"}
{"text":"I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon. I ordered a salad to go. As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didn't. I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow. Very disappointed. $6+ bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers. I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website. I won't be returning here. I'll be passing on lunch next time the co-workers opt for this place."}
{"text":"Great service and great subs. I always order an 8in with roast beef, mayo, provolone, and onions. It is always fresh and they never fail to skimp on the meat. These subs are to die for. The only reason why I knocked off a star is because as someone mentioned before, the cheesesteaks are really... Not to die for at all"}
{"text":"I grabbed a sandwich here (#9 Club Supreme) and the two employees -Zee and Nikki- were such a treat to talk to! They were so upbeat and friendly. I have always had great interactions with the employees here. I love this Jersey Mike's and will be back often. And what made this evening so great - I had enough Shore Points for my sub to be free. Winning!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Jersey Mike's. When i walked in i was greeted by warm smiles asking how can they help. I decided on a 13 the Italian on wheat. It was a fresh deli sandwhich. Not like a subway's pre packed meats.  I was in and out in less then 5 mins. Giving Jimmy Johns a run for their money. The sandwich was very good and quick. I would go there again on my lunch break."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this franchise but tonight's high school crew was a bust. The $13 dollar pastrami sandwich was skimpy at best and I ended up throwing half the bread away and putting all the filling on one sandwich side.  The wraps were tiny too. Flavor wasn't bad but we aren't talking fine dining ie. The meat wasn't spoiled, the bread was fresh etc. Although the meatball sandwich was good, all together a disappointing waste of $34. Don't think this spot will be open for long unless they get their act together."}
{"text":"I've tried Jersey Mike's Subs twice at this location and once in LA. I love that they cut their meats and cheeses fresh and it always smells AMAZING inside the store. That's really the best part that trumps Subway big time. However, their vegetables really don't compare to Subways in terms of variety and tastiness. They pile on a lot of iceberg lettuce, and that sort of overpowers the sandwich with blandness. I'm a big vegetable person, so it's important to me. But if you're just a meat and cheese person, then Jersey Mike's is definitely better."}
{"text":"I've gotta admit I really really liked the pastrami Ruben sandwich. The bread was soft (yes I like my bread soft) and not soggy and it was still warm since it was wrapped in foil. They did put the sauerkraut on the side since I wasn't sure if I really wanted it in which they gave me plenty of. The pastrami to bread ratio was decent, it's not filled with pastrami like other sandwich places so people may be a little put off by that. I can't say anything about the service as my husband had picked it up, but there were no complaints as he was home fairly quick. I did get to try a regular sub sandwich and it was good but definitely not my favorite joint to get a cold sammy. Overall, I've been back to Jersey Mikes once or every other week for the pastrami sandwich (pregnant women cravings) and I've been satisfied each time. It's definitely a winner when you have no idea what you want to eat!"}
{"text":"Tasty fresh good - had the original Italian, as a recent transplant from NJ - it was authentic. My son had a kids meal with tuna fish and he liked it except for the large pieces of celery. No kids portion size drinks - just fountain soda or large gatorades and juices, he opted for blue gatorade. We are in and there was a steady stream of traffic, busy. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"New location in San Tan Pavilions...Williams Field and San Tan Village Pkwy...   Tried them twice(1.5 times really), both terrible experiences! The first time, I ordered a #9, Mikes Way, as I always do at other locations...and I was pre-occupied while they made it...   when I got home, it had no oil and vinegar, no oregano that I recall, no mayo and no bacon...Horrible!    The second time I went(second chance), there was a short line, so I got in line and waited.   And waited, and waited, and waited...   the crew was fumbling around, consulting with one another constantly, going to the back, over and over...after about 5 minutes standing in the same spot with no greeting, I left.  Obviously the crew is severely lacking in training...shame on the franchisee. you need to train your people better! They can't make the sandwiches properly, and are Very, very slow.   I was excited when I heard this location was opening, being so close to home...but that has completely fizzled out. I usually don't give third chances to restaurants.   very disappointed."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. We eat here pretty regularly and it's always nice to be welcomed by a familiar face. Their subs are much better than Subway or any other franchise sub place. They're always quick, made fresh and quick to correct any mistakes. Definitely one of our favorite places for a quick, casual meal."}
{"text":"My go-to sub place since they opened!! I have never had a bad sandwich or had to wait long. They are getting expensive so I don't eat there as often as I used to now I usually wait until there is a coupon."}
{"text":"Usual four star Jersey Mike's fare meets one star sanitation. This place has a dirty grill, prep areas and management and employees whose attitude confirms why it is this way. This isn't a review so much as a plea to the health inspector to cite this place before the leftover bits of food and the lettuce, which was slimy, get someone sick.  If these people ran the brand like a franchise store it would be the best food in this desert wasteland of airport eateries."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's Hot Chicken Parm.  It's drenched in an unnaturally sweet tomato sauce. This coupled with a pair of really \"grizzly\" (over cooked) mini chicken breasts.  After three bites it ended it's brief existence in the waste bin. I hope other items on the menu are better."}
{"text":"I have been here before, as well as the one in Glendale. It is almost as good as being home, minus the right chew/crunch to the bread. We East coasters know what I mean. But they pull off the rest. Right mix of meats, and always get your Italian  \"Mike's Way\" which is lots of lettuce, olive oil. vinegar, oregano, etc. I always add hot peppers and I am transported back to Main Place subs in Madison, NJ. Do not let them put mayo on your Italian. Just don't."}
{"text":"Like this location a lot better than my local Macedonia one. Food is good and employees friendly at both but the Stow store is much cleaner and they actually make my sub on top of the sandwich wrapper instead of on the countertop."}
{"text":"Been to this location 3x. The food is good and the staff is friendly enough but as others have noted, it's not especially clean and worse... 2 of the 3 times I have been there, they made my sandwich right on the counter instead of on top of the sandwich wrap.  I didn't even notice the first time until they started sliding the sandwich down the counter to add more toppings. Great, they are wiping the dirty counter with my bun! Mmmm-mmm!"}
{"text":"I really like jersey Mike's.  It's very clean and the food is always fresh.  But what really keeps me coming back is the bread.  I love the bread here it's not overtly soft or crunchy.  The Italian is great also the Turkey and provolone."}
{"text":"I was going to rate this place at four stars, it's fast food after all.   Then I got to thinking about how welcoming, cheerful and friendly the staff was.  How nice it is in these difficult times to find any establishment who's employees go out of the way - above and beyond- to make your experience an enjoyable one.   Add to that that the fair is SO MUCH better than the crap served up at Subway, and you have me as a real fan."}
{"text":"So Jersey Mike's asked me to join their email club (I did) ... then sent me a coupon and encouraged em to order online (I did).... and then they didn't accept the coupon when I picked up my food.  As a Philly guy who has a high standard for cheese steaks and hoagies, I'd say their sandwiches a pretty good (4 stars)... much better than their marketing execution."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff as usual.  Mark took care of us and gave us some hot out of the oven chocolate chip cookies since I told him I lived in Pt. Pleasant, NJ near the original Jersey Mike's.  Our sandwiches were great as usual!  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I grew up in the same town that Jersey Mike's got it's start so I'm a bit of a JM snob.  The staff was very friendly but a bit slow.  They would never survive if they had to serve customers in New Jersey.  The food was on par with most Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"I like some of the sandwich places for different reasons (subway, port of subs, but capriottis is my all-time fave). This one is different because the meats and cheeses are from back east. The subs come on white or wheat rolls- crusty on the outside and soft on the inside (so it can get messy with crumbs). We had a BOGO coupon (from the weekly local circulars) so the pricing was not bad- $12- for two subs, two bags of chips and two drinks (free refills). We also have a stamp card, so we'll get a free sub soon. My husband got the italian- mikes way- lettuce, vinegar, oil, salt and pepper, minus the tomatoes and I got the heated/toasted big kahuna steak (jalapenos, onions, and extra cheese). My husband had a bite of mine and liked it (surprised because he usually avoids heat/spice, unlike me- I love it spicy!).   We've come to this one several times; especially since the one on Trop/Eastern closed. The parking lot was crowded tonight so we had to park in the next lot across the way (still in the same center). There are a lot of ethnic restaurants in the general vicinity and a an office building in the back of all the restaurants. This location is pretty spacious and has lots of seating (tables and chairs) including a row of seats facing the window. It is pretty empty so we had our choice of seats, really. It is also very clean. There are separate bathrooms for the men and women in the back. There was one person working, who was pleasant."}
{"text":"Really delicious and fresh meats. Also the nicest staff I've ever met.  I had the number 6 and the meat was medium rare, which was perfect!"}
{"text":"I don't really rate chains that high unless they do something amazing and unexpected. It's  jersey mike's. Decent sandwiches, not a big selection, a bit pricey."}
{"text":"My dude Squirrel eats a LOT of subs so to switch it up we come here from time-to-time.  To me paying 7-9 bux for something that can be made at home for 2 is nuts and kinda damn lazy too but thats how Squirrel gets down.  Staff is fun and the subs look as fresh as lunchmeat can get.  I used to live in Jersey so the maps and diagrams on the wall bring me back to the days of taking the Path train into the city wearing Davey Dukes, tripping on shrooms with Jim and Terry..."}
{"text":"I went in today a little after lunch. There were several people working and it was fast. The food as always was great. The decorations and atmosphere were awesome. The employees were courteous and happy. I love the fact that they worked so hard and put alot of effort into making the place look festive it makes it feel like a little piece of home. Thanks everyone!"}
{"text":"been to this new location 3 times since they first opened.  quality meats and cheeses  while they are having some minor problems with learning the process overall doing a great job. especially nicole  shes a little rockstar!!  the people giving low star reviews need to understand that a new place needs time for all new employees to meld together and become a team  keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"The crew is always friendly and the store is super clean. You can't go wrong with Jersey Mike's, but you have to go with Mike's way!"}
{"text":"The chipotle cheese steak sandwich is awesome! Not to spicy, just the right amount of heat. The food here is great, everything is fresh made to order. The employees are very attentive."}
{"text":"Been there a few times with the coworkers and we've tried just about every sub on the menu. The hot subs are by far the best. The Reg Chipotle Philly on white is pretty much the best sub you can nab at lunch time. A few tips when you go there:   1. Just get the regular sized sub unless you are splitting the same sub  with someone. Their large size is the length of your arm. For real.  2. Inside seating is limited but there is a nice front patio that they share  freely with other establishments there.  3. Get a sub card...you'll be back.   Very friendly place with very clean inside and they keep the patio nice as well."}
{"text":"Well, My son and I came in and all I hear is \"Oh Geez, wont it ever stop, theres other places to eat you know!\" So I repeated it to the man who said it and his response was \"well there is other places, but you can eat here if you want!\" I almost left immediately but I didnt want to give him the satisfaction. So we ordered our food and before we left I asked him his name. He said, Mark first, then said Mike like he forgot, so its probly not even his real name. But hes about 5'7, red hair, wearing the blue shirt. And we ordered about 2:43 PM. Not happy at all about this experience!"}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mike's Subs!  Everything is so fresh here, the meat, bread, and veggies taste great!  I love the Chipotle Philly Sub and the Club Supreme.  I'm not sure what it is that makes Jersey Mike's way better than Subway or Quizno's, but maybe its the fresh cut meat, fresh cut cheese, or fresh bread.    Check it out!"}
{"text":"So glad this place went in when Subway left -- everything is so fresh and made to order perfectly. Would absolutely recommend for a good deli sandwich."}
{"text":"These guys here are the best. Great and fast customer service, very friendly. I ordered several 15 inch sandwiches for a picnic and they came fully loaded. The best part is you get to watch them cut up your choice of deli meat, and they were not skimpy. The 15 inch was cut up in fours, which was perfect so we can sample each. The roast beef and turkey club was very good, they have an optional spicy red  relish sauce, a must try if you like a little kick. I also picked up a lot of their fresh baked cookies. Chocolate chip, white macadamia nut, sugar, and peanut butter. They were all very good, but the peanut butter was just ok. I will be returning when back in town."}
{"text":"I really really like this place!! The dudes are hella silly and totally take care of you. I got the medium Capicola, ham, but with swiss! I was in love!! They need to put a little more meat, but none the less it was yummy!!   The bread is super good, and I wanted more!! The downfall is that its pricey! In Colorado you can get the same sized sub for 3.45$ (and it has more meat) For this bad boy I think its was like 6.45$!!! If you add a drink and some chips its a 10$ meal! Hot damn!  If you are ever in Pueblo, CO go to a place called Collettes, it blows capriottis, jersey mikes, and any other sub place out of this universe!  They gave us some free pb cookies which was gnarly.   I'd go back, but I'm still on the search for a super yummy, not breaking the bank, sub!"}
{"text":"Great fast food that won't leave you feeling greasy afterwards. The meat is sliced in-front of you and tastes great. For a step above Subway or other fast food subs, try this place out!  Prices are a bit more than at other fast food locales, but I think that the quality is worth it. Also, I tend not to frequent big chains, unless asked by friends."}
{"text":"it was alright... nothing special and really expensive for a small sub, chips and a drink. probably wont be back."}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast and was really craving a Philly cheese steak sandwhich and so I ordered from here. It. Was. Amazing - messy and delicious. Highly recommended! The cookies were a nice addition ;)"}
{"text":"Friendly ladies served us on a Sunday morning. I think they probably get a lot of driving-back-to-LA slightly hungover folks on Sundays. I got the Philly Cheese steak. Bread was so soft and fluffy - it totally made the sandwich. Great quick place to stop before hitting the road back to California."}
{"text":"Really fresh and tasty subs. Friendly staff. Clean environment as well. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"The people behind the counter were more interested in flirting with college students then helping the long line of customers."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! If I could give this establishment a -5 I would, I had a free regular sub coupon, with no expiration date and they would not honor it. In fact they would rather throw the sub away than honor the coupon. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Now I thought Subway was the only sandwich shop worth going to, but boy was I proven wrong. Jersey Mike's knows what I want in a sub! The sub was delicious. Not only was it good, it was real! By real, I mean real meat! They literally sliced the meat right in front of me! Then going Mike's Way (clever use of the name by the way) made my sandwich even better. To my surprise, the sandwich artist ACTUALLY had a conversation with me! Today's youth may be at times rude, but not here. Excellent customer service this place has. Definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"Small amount of food for the price. 3 times the lettuce any human would be interested in on a sandwich. I could have been just as disappointed at Subway for less money."}
{"text":"It's a pretty good sandwich shop, but if you just finish hiking and Etc its not the place to keep you full lol"}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations. First time in a Jersey Mike's. I was surprised to find they have several hot subs and actually cook the meat on a hot grill, not just microwave it. My Big Laguna cheese steak sub was very good. One kid said his chicken ranch sub was very good even though they didn't prepare it exactly as ordered. Other kid said meatball sub was better than Subway. The order, pay, online pickup process seemed needlessly chaotic. Subs were good."}
{"text":"Service was very slow and inaccurate. The couple in front of us paid and sat down to eat their food when one of the workers came and ask them for another dollar because he gave them too much change. After we ordered and paid while waiting for our subs they then told us we didn't pay and had to show our bank account to prove that we just paid for our subs. They had to make my sub multiple times due to not cooking the chicken properly. Very unorganized staff."}
{"text":"It's too bad Yelp doesn't do half of stars because this place definitely deserves 4.5 stars. The only thing I don't like about it is that the parking is terrible and getting in and out of it is even worse. Everything else about the sandwich shop is awesome. he reminds me of the Togo's in California that I used to go to without fresh there meats are and bread. I get the California club with no bacon an extra Turkey which is phenomenal. my friend gets the number 10 with provolone and that looks pretty amazing as well.  I would warn that if you're going to call ahead make sure you have your order ready and you're very clear about what you're looking to have ordered along with having them repeat back your order.   The location is right between a Smashburger and a Sprint store kind of tucked away right off of Las Vegas Boulevard near the outlet shopping center."}
{"text":"Overall: 4 stars.  A good option for subs.  Not cheap, but you get a decent amount for the money.  Food: 4 stars.  They have a good selection of hot and cold subs.  I like how they slide the meat per order.  The \"Mike's way\" is good.  The red hot sauce is very tasty.  Prices: 3 stars:  They are relatively high prices for subs, but I can sometimes get 2 meals out of one.  Service: 3 stars.  Normal fast food type service.  Interior: 3 stars.  Nothing overly unique; tables and a couple TVs."}
{"text":"1.5 stars, only for the food.   this is *consistently* the absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced. I've been here roughly 5 times and the guys behind the counter are always dicks. Every single one of you. I hope you read this too.   Not a single one actually cares about the customer, while I'm not asking you to be friendly, hell you don't even have to talk to me, just don't act like a dick! It's really really easy. If subway is beating you in customer service, just close your doors.   The worst part is that I see the attitude of the employees coming from the top down. The manager also, does not care. The store is consistently dirty, service is super slow, and the employees talk down to you and make fun of for not having it \"mikes way\".   Oh here's the best part, do you want oil and vinegar on your sandwich? I hope everyone else does too! Because any lettuce that falls off the sandwich that has oil/vinegar on it, goes back to the lettuce bin with all the other \"fresh\" lettuce! I have seen this multiple times. Pretty sure this is against health code.   The employees seem to have an attitude of \"the customer is always wrong\" approach. Don't want it mikes way? What's wrong with this idiot? The guy making my sandwich literally rolled his eyes when I asked for different cheese. Um, ok? Is it more work to use one cheese instead of another?   Multiple times I have ordered cookies, and literally half the time I have to remind the guy I just told 10 seconds ago, that I ordered cookies. \"Yeah, can I have a small drink and two cookies?\" No cookies, every time. \"Um, can I have my cookies please?\"   \"oh yeah, sorry bro, my bad\"  yes, it is your bad, every time your bad, and you just don't care. What's worse? I've gotten WRONG cookies multiple times! Like, what? I don't even... how is this possible? Do you just throw any random cookie in a bag and hope it's the one I ordered? I WISH i was exaggerating!  Want a chocolate chip cookie? Haha good luck! Raisin for you asshole!   God this place is terrible."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's when they first opened this location they gave the company I work for a bunch of free sub coupons... I ordered the #56 Big Kahuna Cheese Steak on wheat bread (Grilled onions and peppers plus mushrooms, jalapenos and extra cheese)...  I have not looked back this is one of the best cheese steaks I have ever had in Arizona it's a must try for cheese steak lovers."}
{"text":"This place should be 4-5 stars because The Cheese steaks are fantastic, I really do love them.  The price is kinda high for a meal, but to be fair the \"Giant\" is truly giant, and their ingredients are fresh  Unfortunately this location's customer service is pretty terrible.   I have been there about 5 times and I probably will not return.  The employees are constantly talking and joking with each other, which in return causes errors.  Every single time I have been there, either me, or someone in front of me had an issue with an order.  The time before my previous time I had picked up food for my GF and I to take to her work.  I only received one sandwich.  I had asked for my other sandwich and they said they forgot to make it.  NBD so I waited, got my bag and rushed out the door without checking the bag.  Some how I turned out with 3 sandwiches, which means someone else was shorted.  Obviously the mistake benefited me, had I caught it I would have given it back, but that is the type of stuff that happens all the time at this location.   Now my most recent time a guy in front of me had an order for 4 sandwiches.  They gave him 3 and he had asked for the 4th sandwich.  They then said they forgot to make it and gave it to him.  Then I realized after he had left that they were not making anything on the hot pad (I had a hot sandwich)  After 10 mins I asked if my sandwich was being made.  No one acknowledged me and they began making it.  My guess is they must have accidentally given him mine.   Its great the employees get along, but come on, joke around when there isn't people trying to order food.  Also they ask for tips at the register.  You are a sandwich place not a dine in."}
{"text":"Have not been there in years because the first experience was terrible, but had a coupon so decided to try it again. Well it was just as bad all these years later. They would not honor the coupon because the fountain machine was down. Again very poor management IMO"}
{"text":"This is my preferred sub shop, I eat here at least once a week and always order the regular-size number 13 on white,\" which is an Italian sub with various different meats and cheese sliced quickly in front of you. Just let them make it \"Mike's way,\" for a wonderful combo of lettuce, tomato, spices and oil and vinegar. I also add cherry pepper relish for a little kick. If you prefer soft bread and plenty of ingredients instead of too much bread, you should try Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and great personal customer service. Love the turkey sandwich done \"Mike's Way\". Quick, efficient and delicious."}
{"text":"Always super friendly staff. Walked in with my 2 little boys one time to order 6 subs and sides. The owner personally helped me out with all my stuff seeing that my hands were full already. Food is always good and fresh and made to order. I will say the cookies aren't my favorite though. They need to rethink that recipe.  good thing it's a sandwich shop and not a cookie shop."}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mikes! I usually get the Italian sub, and it's amazing! I also got the Philly Cheesesteak and it was the sooooo good! They are friendly whenever I go in. I do think it's a little pricey, but way better quality than Subway."}
{"text":"Totally screws up an orders placed through the app. 1st acted like they didn't get the order and then said they found it but was not how I ordered the sandwiches - not good!"}
{"text":"My wife and I checked out Jersey Mike's for lunch on Saturday.  I gather they are a chain, but it was the first time I've tried one.  I had the Chipotle Chicken, she had a turkey sub.  The chicken was pretty good, not too spicy, but it seemed to be just chicken, cheese, onions and maybe peppers - could have used something else.  My wife liked her turkey.  They seem to only have one kind of bread, its fine, but nothing special.  Everyone was friendly, but it was a little slow on the hot sub.  I'd say it was fine, better than Subway, not as good as Cosmic Dave's.  I can't imagine crazing it, but I'd eat it again if that was convenient."}
{"text":"Other than a bad bad batch of avocado, there's decent subs here. I would ask them that they use fresher mop water when cleaning the floors; it smells sour."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with their range of sandwiches and wheat bread options. Always clean and good customer service."}
{"text":"Very clean, very friendly staff, and exceptionally fast preparation of a hot sub.  I am very pleased!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great sub! First time there for lunch today and I was impressed with the #13 Original. Everything freshly thin sliced and the bread was excellent."}
{"text":"A fairly new store with friendly staff.  I use the online ordering service which is pretty convenient and my food is always fresh tasting and prepared on time for pickup.  Love this location!"}
{"text":"Basically $10 a sub. Kind of cool that they slice the roast beef fresh but it was rather overcooked/dry."}
{"text":"The food was excellent except I ordered a Krabby Patty and when my server \"Damico\" brothers brought it out. There were no pickles on my patty even know I specifically ordered pickles. I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"I only recently discovered the deliciousness that is Jersey Mike's (which has now ruined me forever to the garbage that is Subway) but I'd only been to the location in Ahwatukee by where I work.  When I drove past this place with a friend after leaving the gym a different way than usual I actually turned us back around to get something to eat.  The menu, sandwiches, atmosphere all of that is pretty much going to be the same at whichever location you go to but I will say that the staff that was working the day we went in was great.  They were joking around with us and making actual conversation while we went through ordering and waiting in line.  My friend can be a little particular about how she orders and wants things which can sometimes annoy people at some places but these guys graciously did everything she asked without putting up a fuss.  Definitely a great experience."}
{"text":"Way to expensive and there philly cheese stack taste terrible. Pass on ever eating there again"}
{"text":"My first and last time going to jersey mikes located on Simmons. The other day myself and two others decided to go to jersey mikes for sandwiches, BIG MISTAKE! We walked in and told them the sandwich we wanted. The guy there grab the bread without changing gloves or anything. God knows when the last time he changed them. This bonehead then places the bread on the counter, yes the counter! He didn't put paper down below the sandwhiches! The guy then goes to the back to get the meat and he brings them to the slicer and starts slicing and putting it on the sandwiches. Then another guy comes up and slides our sandwiches down the counter and ask us what we wanted on the sandwiches. We tell him. The guy was very slow and lousy. After all this he finally puts the paper underneath the sandwich and he gets a knife and cuts the first sandwich. As he cuts I notice it was a dirty towel beside him and the towel appeared to be soaked in old sauce. It seemed like it's was thrown in a tub of mayo and mustard. After he cuts the first he wipes the knife with the dirty a** towel and then proceeds to cut the next sandwich. A friend of mine then asks The guy is the towel clean. He then says, \"yes I got it 10 minutes ago\". It did not sit well with me at all and even the guy behind us raised his eyebrows. He then wraps our sandwiches up and bags them. We ordered only 3 sandwiches, not to big in size at all and it came out to $25!! Way too overpriced for such basic sandwiches. I  honestly hated this place! It seems to be ran by boneheads teens. Save your money please."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Jersey Mikes regardless but I just experienced the best customer service I could ever get from a fast casual chain EVER!!!!! The manager and staff went above and beyond for my husband.  WE WILL ALWAYS RETURN HAPPY CUSTOMERS  britt and brent from fletchers"}
{"text":"There was a Jersey Mike's near my work location when I lived in the Twin Cities, so I was excited to see one opening up in Middleton. It's a great addition to Greenway Station's restaurant offerings and Middleton's sub scene as a whole. The clean surroundings, fresh-cut meats & cheeses, crisp veggies and friendly service make the sandwiches worth the longer wait than you'll experience at nearby Subway or Milio's or down-the-road Cousins, but at just a fraction of the wait than Firehouse Subs a few exits down the Beltline. They get a little jammed over the weekday lunch rush, but you're still in & out pretty fast.   Make no mistake: If you're a New Jersey hoagie or Philly cheesesteak snob, you're not going to like my 4-star review of this place. However, you are in Madison, Wisconsin, so the sub reviews are going to be in comparison to other local options, and I would choose Jersey Mike's over the other local options. If you don't like it, fuggedaboudit -- Philly and the Jersey Shore are just a short, private-jet flight away."}
{"text":"Stale roll at two locations this week. I think I'm gona try somewhere else next. Why do they cut roll in half ? It should just be sliced to hold together better. R these guys really from Jersey?"}
{"text":"Could the staff be any nicer? I don't think so. Could sandwiches be any more delectable? I doubt it. Could the location be any more convenient? Perhaps, but hey, who's complaining. The place is clean and bright. Don't be a Sad Sack and sign up for their email club. You will get all kinds of offers. So if you want a sub and find yourself in the area, stop on in and have one. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Horrible service with very poor food handling skills. The lady was too busy talking to get the order right and kept interrupting the customers during the order to talk to staff. No wonder all the orders were messed up. I should have known when the lady ahead of me had to shout to the guy \"no mayo\" for the third time my order would be a mess. His response and the managers was \"well it comes with it\". Apparently no individualization of orders is allowed."}
{"text":"So people were RAVING about this place at my work... and I work at a sub shop. I was tempted to see and taste the competition. Both the workers messed up a few times and dropped stuff and looked as if they were lost. MIkes way seems okay but i didnt get it.. Instead they drenched my sandwich in some sort of dressings or oils.. wow it was salty and sweet as hell. I give the sub a 2 star. and the workers a 1.. I dont know if ill be back often if ever."}
{"text":"I'm so happy they opened this store close to my house. Food was on point, employees greeted and actually look happy to be at work. Got me in with coupon in mail, will now be part of loyalty program"}
{"text":"I enjoy Jersey Mike's Philly's to be honest I haven't ordered anything else and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"The food is good the service is one of the worst I have ever experienced. I try to go here on weekends but I have been soooo disappointed in he lack of staff and customer service at this location. It takes 15-20 minutes to get your order even when you call ahead. They have no priority for clients who call ahead. They make you wait in line even though your order is sitting on the bar. He worst service ever and employees have no concern for customer service. I only come back for the food but at some point that will no longer be an option."}
{"text":"There isn't a lot I can add that other recent reviews hasn't touched on already.  I went with the large turkey ham club sub.  I expected much more for $15.  I counted two slices of ham, two slices of turkey and one slice of provolone cheese.  The lettuce was fresh and the roll light and tastes, but that's it.  I don't see and real reason I would go back to this location, or any other for that matter.  I'm left wondering what exactly did I pay for? Light Italian style bread and a little lettuce for $15 I guess sums it up."}
{"text":"The Worlds Best Sandwiches come from Jersey Mike's Subs!   My personal favorite?  #13 The Original Italian!!! I've been ordering the same sandwich since 2006!! Comes with Provolone, ham, prosciuttini, cappacuolo, salami and pepperoni! Best Sandwich ever! Why order anything else? Everything is FRESH! Great quality ingredients! Prices aren't bad either.   I've never had a bad experience. I've been to several locations. The staff is friendly, the food is perfection!   Here's a Tip: To earn freebies, signup for their \"Shore Points\" Card. The App comes in handy when ordering ahead of time. Occasionally, I will call in--My food is always ready on time. Eventually I will order off their catering menu. I haven't had the opportunity.   As always! I will continue to visit Jersey Mikes! Thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"Thank goodness this location is open on Saturdays... .this location is close to my house, normally i visit the steel creek location (too far).   Sandwiches I would recommend...#13!!! My personally favorite since highschool, Freshman year and forward. My family always order from here....No Tea No Shade, but publixs has nothing on Jersey Mikes Bread. I'm not into carbs really, the texture of publixs white bread requires a little pull. Gasp....i'm getting Episodic about bread.... Anywho. Overall I appricate how Jersey Mikes prepares their sandwiches, thin meats and cheeses, and Fluffy....yes i said (Fluffy) bread."}
{"text":"I always liked jersey mikes. Close to home. Friendly people at this location. Food's great. Love the turkey breast mikes way."}
{"text":"Delicious subs! The inside of this location is on the small side, but I typically grab subs to go or order through Ubereats so no big deal. Jersey Mike's is up there for me as one of the best sub spots.   The Italian sub is good and a regular is more than enough food for me. It's loaded with meat, so much so that I usually remove some of the ham. The only thing that would make it better is if they heated their subs. The chocolate chip cookies are great for pre-packaged cookies."}
{"text":"Had the cheese steak with chipotle mayo.  Took a little while to cook but the taste was good.  Bread was fresh and cheese was melted good.  Friendly service and fairly clean restaurant."}
{"text":"If you like fresh subs this is the place. Fresh sliced deli meat, and the bread is delicious. It's fast food that won't leave you feeling gross like other places. The store is also really clean, which is important to me. They have great employees that are really helpful if your not sure what to get. Check it out."}
{"text":"Went to this Jersey Mike's Subs with family.  It's been a while and I was surprised to see that now they offer hot subs.  So I went with the Famous Philly Cheesesteak. It came hot and wrapped.  The meat and cheese were blended thoroughly and the cheese was melty goodness.  The onions and peppers weren't overpowering like at other places.  I'm not a mayo fan and there are no other condiments or additions unless you ask which is great."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were really good !! However HORRIBLE customer service. We didn't read the coupons fine print and that was our bad so they fixed it for us but the entire time the employee was giving us dirty looks and as we were leaving I turned around to grab napkins and she was staring at me with the meanest/dirtiest look on her face and she didn't hold back either. She made it very clear that she was upset over our mistake and personally made me feel very uncomfortable. I wasn't expecting that behavior at all.. I really liked subs i just wish my first visit and experience there wasn't this bad.."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this location for years. We have always loved this location until today. We had the worst service ever. First things first I asked for a hot ham and cheese and if they heated it I couldn't tell because the cheese wasn't melted and the meat was cold and when I asked the manager on duty or whom I'm assuming to be the manager had a little attitude about it. I shrugged it off. Then they messed up my husband's sandwich not once but twice. Each time the manager cut her eyes at my husband each time they messed. She had a horrible attitude. Then she tried to hand him a coupon for a free sandwich but we didn't take it because we just wanted our food to be correct and be treated with respect. We had my mother in law with us an we had told her how great this location was."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my visit for lunch today.  Ordered a roast beef and provolone.  They were very stingy on the meat and cheese.  I expected more especially given that I paid over 10 bucks for a 6 inch sub, chips, and a drink.  At that price put more on the sub please!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's in Mooresville NC is terrible. Bread has consistency of hot dog rolls and turns soggy when any liquid is applied to the sandwich. Ordered a cheese steak sub and the bread was soggy before I even began to eat the sub. I'm from New Jersey and their subs are terrible and the customer service has an attitude which is not earned."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time late one weekday when we were the only customers in the place, which meant that all three employees behind the counter gave us their full attention! This is surprising because, at most sandwich places, all three workers would be hiding in the back room and one would reluctantly peek out, sigh, then drag themselves to \"greet\" us. Needless to say, I was impressed and we hadn't even ordered yet!   We stood back and perused the options for a bit before one dude, who I think was maybe the manager, gave us some suggestions. Specifically, the roast beef and provolone sub or the Italian sub. While we continued to hem and haw, he offered us a slice of the roast beef, which he sliced and salted in front of us saying \"This is my favorite snack!\" YUM! They cook the beef in house, so they can make it as rare as they want and this was fabulous. Great sale! Husband really enjoyed his #6....  ...but mine was SO. MUCH. BETTER. Jersey Mike's Famous Philly with added grilled mushrooms. The perfect combination of meaty and cheesy plus the grilled mushrooms, peppers, and onions... HEAVEN! Not to mention, we each got a free cookie since we were newbies, so don't be afraid to tell them so!   We don't do subs very often, but I'm turning over a new leaf! The only thing I hope they change is the fact that nobody wore nametags. With as personable the employees were, you'd think they'd have their names out there for us to use."}
{"text":"Subs are excellent Subway dream on. Staff is always friendly, fast and trained. I have been a Chef for over 30 plus years. Starting in sandwich shops when I was 12. Working may way up from dishwasher to Executive Chef. Working all over the country, Europe, South African and know AZ. Anyway my point is I know food. Even  though this is a Sub place and not a four star restaurant they do a great job and they are consistent. Fresh Quality products. Restaurant is Clean and the staff works as a team.  Congrats Keep up the good work. Chef Marcus"}
{"text":"Any jersey Mikes location with good friendly people. Ahhh sandwich with flavor. A must have for all."}
{"text":"Just good ole subs like I grew up with back in Jersey. Has the other sub shops (subway) beat. They slice all deli meat fresh for your sandwich to order. Staff extremely friendly from the time you open the door til you leave. They take great pride to serve you the best sandwich. Definitely a place to eat at and I will be back with the family again! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Hidden amongst the GIANTS of Fine Dining @JerseyMikesSub is a real treat!!  I received a flyer in the mail for a BOGO sub and after seeing this place on the Travel Channel's Sandwich Paradise I knew it had to be good.  This was my 1st trip to a Jersey Mikes and I was truly delighted with the quality & flavor of the subs.  Philly Cheesesteaks, Turkey Clubs and all made fresh to order. ONLY one kinda bread but its GREAT!  A litle pricier than Subway,Quiznos,Port O Subs,etc but WAY BETTER!!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  I ordered the club and when I got back to work to eat it, there was hardly any roast beef at all.  It was more or less a turkey sandwich with slivers or roast beef.  When you are shelling out $12.45 for a SUB, there should be some meat on it.  Very disappointed and probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Stood in there for 25 minutes, and when I finally asked about my order they hadn't even started it. The most disorganized place I've been since living in Charlotte."}
{"text":"What a delightful find. The subs are great and my office was extremely happy with the catering order that I purchased for them. They have all become new Jersey Mike's customers as well. The staff is also friendly and polite. Overall, a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"First time at the new location. This place has so many different sub options. It was nice because they had a lot of chicken and steak options. All that we had was very good.  This isn't like subway. The meets are super fresh. They cut and put back in the freezer. The lines are long and they have a lot more people working.  Happy they're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Staff seem friendly and food is pretty good.The food tastes real unlike some more processed places.We went in the evening so there was only one other couple there.Not sure if they ever get busy. I thought it was nice of the worker to let me taste the chipotle mayo to see if I would like it.I got the California Chicken Chipotle. The atmosphere is pretty plain, but good is still good."}
{"text":"I had the chicken cheese steak and it was delicious! Fast and courteous service. I would definitaly recommend you give it try!"}
{"text":"I was wondering around the complex trying to find a place to eat, when I found Jersey Mike's Subs in the corner of the strip-mall area. I was expecting a sub shop somewhat along the lines of one of their competitors in terms of price and taste. Unfortunately, neither price or taste compared to any of their competitors.  I waited 15+ minutes (I'll be a little lenient because it was lunch time), but the way the line grew, I was expecting something more since it seemed like a popular place to be. There were at least 20 customers in line and only 3 - 4 people working, at most... The guy who assembled the sandwiches needed a helper because it took him for-ev-er to get all the junk on the sandwich. But, I only gripe because I am very impatient. Especially during my lunch hour at work.  The price was ridiculous... $10 for a regular sub, chips and small drink. I ordered the club \"Mike's Way\" and took it back to work to eat. I got to work to try and eat the sub, which was a 5 minute drive away, and part of the sub was soggy from all the vinegar/oil that was on there. The other part of the bread was a little tough. The flavor? What flavor? It had bacon on it for God's sakes! It should have tasted like SOMETHING... nada... I mainly tasted the mound of vinegar that was on the thing.   Needless to say, I didn't feel this place will be worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Nothing great about this place. They could replace the sign with Subway and I would never know...except that there would be fewer options to top my sub with. They coined the phrase \"Mike's Way\" in an effort to allow you to order your sandwich in some special and tasty way. In reality, it means lettuce, tomatoes, oil and vinegar...wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. As a vegetarian, this is one of my least favorite sub places since there are not too many toppings for those of us avoiding the meat selections.  I've only been here once and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Well, this definitely is no Capriotti's. I hate when sandwich shops totally disregard the importance of bread. Bread. Its more than the transport mechanism for meat, people. So many places cheap out and serve us basic flavorless bread substance, and continue to serve it even after its gone a bit hard and stale. I effing hate that.   *Bread - yuk. I had to peel most of it off and toss the hard ends. Thanks. *Tried the chipotle cheese steak and the king cheese steak - decent, but won't bring me back. Jalapenos don't take the place of sweet/hot Italian peppers. Sissy-level heat. *Service - great, but can't compensate for mediocre food."}
{"text":"I know, I know... avoid the chains and big box stores at all costs, but I just happened to be looking for a decent sandwich for lunch.  I stopped in and fell in like with a ton of college students (if you want to feel old, eat here).  Strange thing was that one of the employees came to the back of the line and took my order so I didn't have to stand in line.    Had the chicken ceasar wrap, which was good and the chicken was nice and hot.  Still not too sure why they let me skip everyone in line, but I guess they work from the two ends and attack the line that way.  Oh well... sorry all those folks in the middle!  The service was friendly and the place clean despite all the college kids.  Since the place is in a strip mall it would seem small when you see it from the street, but it's actually pretty roomy inside."}
{"text":"These days I only frequent two sub chains with Jersey Mikes being one of them.  Jersey Mike's is similar to Lenny's (the other chain i frequent).  The cut the meat while you wait and build your sandwich to your specifications.  And they don't weigh out the meat like some places do.  Jersey Mike's stuffs your sandwich so you get your money's worth.  The ingredients are always fresh and the staff is almost always friendly here.    Try it Mike's Way with lettuce, tomato, onions, oil and vinegar, salt and pepper and oregano."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches (with vegetarian options) and fun flirty guys to make them. Actually I lied, I've never had an actual sandwich, just the wraps, but they're killer. I love the veggie wrap - I feel like they use fresh veggies and the tortillas are soft. They're out of a bag, but still good. The only bummer for me is this place is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Sorry Sam S. Guess you've never worked in the restaurant industry, especially one when they first open training a new crew. I waited Sunday night for my sandwiches and saw a crew working really hard and the order  was amazing. If I were you and don't have patience to wait, give it another try in a couple of months. We tried them when we lived in North Carolina and are glad they're here."}
{"text":"Very pricey. $11.25 for a small soda a regular sub and a bag of chips. The bread is good. But the sub overall is not so great. The meet is sliced very thin and pressed together. The only condiments are lettuce and a lot of it, tomatoes, a few peppers and a great deal of some sort of Italian dressing that soaks the bread. It certainly was not my best experience at a sub shop but they were quick and very nice. The most frustrating thing about this location is that it is a very small parking lot serving four or five restaurants. The parking spots are small and it is almost impossible to find a space or to get in or out of one as there are five and six people deep waiting for a space"}
{"text":"I bought the Giant Big Kahuna Cheese Steak. My son bought a Tuna, and I wasn't paying attention to what his girlfriend ordered. The sub had pretty decent flavor to it, and my son and gf concur. I asked for extra jalapeño, sweet peppers, and also asked for banana peppers to be added on as well. I don't think any of that extra was added as I found maybe a tiny few jalapeños, not more than a average amount of sweet peppers and an no amount of banana peppers.  Two breads available white and wheat. They were good, soft and fresh.   I thought the ordering and creation process were pretty inefficient. Why do you need to place an order I am paying for on 3 separate tickets, when I am paying for all 3 people? Then we each need to hand them to the cashier so I alone would be able to pay for them. The other sub place (unnamed) efficiency has you beat by miles on this.  The 3 or 4  additional individuals were twiddling their thumbs most of the time. Maybe if the process for order and creation were better managed and streamlined you wouldn't need an extra employee and bring the prices down. The place was clean as it just opened a couple days ago.  The sub was $15.xx alone. I noticed they had a grand opening coupon flyer to the back side of the cash register. I grabbed one and used the 50% off a giant sub combo. After the discount it was $11.75 a decent deal. However at close to probably $18 or $19 as a combo deal (giant sub, chips and drink) regular price that is kind of high in my opinion.  First time there, probably the last time there. For a few bucks more on an order of 3 giant combos, I could be having a full sit down meal for 3 someplace on the semi inexpensive side (Texas Roadhouse, Chili's, Lonestar, Village Inn, Applebee's, Sweet Tomatoes, etc. take your pick)  March 2, 2018. The manager reached out to me, and I greatly appreciate this. Some of the production issues are due to just opening and employee's becoming oriented to the process. I can accept and understand this.  He did mention Jersey Mike's uses premium ingredients for their subs, accounting for the price difference. I concur based on what I had last night the ingredients on the sub would be considered premium.  Due to the fact the manager reached out I will certainly give them another shot as I always appreciate individuals who are vested in the success of their eatery and care about their customers feedback. Thank you again for reaching out to me."}
{"text":"My family started frequenting this Jersey Mike's location as an alternative to Subway, but our experiences have forced us to find an alternative to Jersey Mike's.   I don't mind paying a premium price for quality, but every time I've visited this particular JM, I always end up disappointed. For example, next time you get cheese on your sandwich take notice of how thinly the cheese is sliced.  It is sliced so thin that you can actually see through it. The chicken Caesar wrap is also a huge disappointment. It's a load of lettuce with a very small amount of chicken. For $8.00+, the price/quality/value ratio is way off.   We've found a better local option for sandwiches and will no longer frequent this Jersey Mike's location."}
{"text":"Spent $15 on Chicken Parm, got all the way home and they gave me a meatball sub. The people were nice but this experience was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Gear sandwiches and great employees!  I love the club sandwich here and always such fresh bread and meat. It is worth a stop in to enjoy one of these sandwiches."}
{"text":"Came in today to order a chipotle cheesesteak. Service was very prompt and the crew was extremely helpful and friendly. My sandwich was super delicious. I will absolutely be returning to this location. Big thanks to Brittany, Panch, John, and Vanessa for such an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Now this is an east coast sub!  Bread isn't too soft & everything is fresh!  Plus the cheese steaks are the best I've found here in AZ (though they really need to add french fries to the menu :) I go here at least once a week and it's great each time!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out for the first time due to a coupon at work (YAY coupons!).  I had turkey and provolone on wheat \"Mike's Way\" (onions, lettuce, tomatoes, olive oil blend, red wine vinegar and spices).    I was kind of cautious about having it \"Mike's Way\" since I usually load my sub up with olives, red onions, pickles, tomatoes, cucumbers, ranch, salt/pepper and everything else almost under the sun -- however, since the veggies were SO good, crisp, fresh, ripe, etc, the meat plentiful and the bread was great - it was perfect.    Also, the staff were super friendly.... My only regret is that I did not pick up napkins!  So, thanks! I'll be back for sure!  The regular sub was a perfect size for lunch.  :)"}
{"text":"I had an appointment nearby and had about an hour to kill so my daughter and I decided to get a quick bite to eat Incase my meeting went longer than planned. We happened upon Jersey Mike's while driving and decided to give this location a try. It's in a small shopping center next to a Starbucks. There was plenty of parking and easy to get in and out with it being right next to s stop light. There were about 4 people ahead of us , but the line went very quickly. When it was our turn to order I was just a bit let down at the employees lack of interaction. From the look and vibe I got I felt it must've been a long day for the guy. I get it. You're tired or whatever, but your at work. Put your game face on. Maybe it's just me but I feel like the more people you make smile will make you smile. The day might bring a bit more joy for you or someone who may need it. Our sandwiches were great, tasted fresh and again were made very quickly and we were in and out in about 10 minutes. We took them to go so we could make sure we got to where we needed to be in time. Location was clean. Parking lot was a bit dark, but other than that it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"Very impressed from the Second we walked in. We were greeted immediately and it smelled amazing inside. We ordered a Italian sandwich and a philly cheese steak. Both were ready in minutes. We decided to eat inside. It was very busy with a lot of people coming and going. It was very clean inside and the employees all seemed very organized. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If I could put a negative on the worse service ever I would... I usually always go to the new location on rainbow and lake mead and they are so amazing but since we moved this location is the closes one.... 3 girls working none of them smiling, 2 with cocky ass smirks on their faces... I understand sandwiches come with just whats on the menu but the location I always go to on rainbow they always asks me before wrapping my sandwich \"would you like to add anything to your sandwich!\" The girl doing my sandwich with her excessive highlight didn't even say sorry nothing but all did she was overload my sandwich with mayo and pass it on to the other girl and they wrapped my sandwich or should I say smashed my sandwich if there was a family there with little kids I would of gave her some advice on how to do customer service the right way and to watch her facial expression if you don't like it find a job that doesn't require being around people. Oh and never degrade another employee in front of a customer that's a no no!!! I'll survive not eating jersey mikes if I crave it I'll drive to the other side if I have too!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is bad. Got turkey and cheese to go and the bread was so stale it was literally inedible. I picked off the turkey and ate it w crackers from my pantry. Disappointed bc I really like Jersey Mike's but will never try this location again. Bread that old should never come close to being served to customers. Gross."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to this Jersey Mike's in awhile, it's under new management and it's SO much better. We love Jersey Mike's but stopped coming to this one about 9 months ago. We drove by over the weekend and found out that it had been under new management since September of 2015. The girls making the sandwiches were AWESOME! They took our 2 orders at the slicer and not only remembered what we ordered without having to ask us multiple times, but they were super quick! It was very speedy, they were friendly and they didn't harass us to buy additional items. They asked us in a very friendly manner to upgrade to combo meals, etc., but did it politely and didn't harass us when we only wanted the sandwiches. The previous owner's help always tried to make us purchase combo meals and a cookie. Then they made fun of us for never wanting bacon. Yes, funny the first time, kinda funny the second time, but EVERY time we went in there, it was the same. This is why we stopped going. Not any more - these gals were awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food is very good.  Good value with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Don't think I will be back I am not a fan of soggy cold sandwiches and cheap tasting deli meats. The girl behind the counter was great. She was very nice and friendly. That can make up for my trip. but that will never give my money back for my nasty sandwich.  Sorry Jersey Mikes you may be good some but not this girl."}
{"text":"If you want to go to an over priced sandwich shop with punk kids that work there I would recommend coming here. Otherwise there are many way better close options. Work on your staff attitude Jersey Mike's... Sincerely EVERYONE."}
{"text":"This is another one of my favorite lunch places. I usually have Regular 13 (The Original Italian) or the Regular 43 (Chipotle Cheese Steak). Both are fantastic! Lisa, the owner, greets me by name, and adds a dash of a barista feel to the place. The bread is always fresh, too."}
{"text":"Love how close this location is. We enjoy frequently eating here. The location is always clean and does a fantastic job on our orders. Staff is very friendly and makes the overall experience a great visit. Cannot say enough it's how the staff treats its customers that makes a world of difference"}
{"text":"After a long day of work I stopped in to buy subs for the family.  I ordered one giant, and two regular.  Placed my order, told them how I wanted them and moved to the register.  While waiting I paid for my order and moved aside so others could pay.  The place was not busy, one person in front of me, and one person behind.  4 workers behind the counter.  It seemed they were somewhat unorganized and didn't have set roles.  Service was slow.  I was handed my bag and out the door I went.  Didn't think I needed to check my order, it was only 3 sandwiches!  Drove all the way home, and found my order was incorrect.  I paid for one giant and got three regular.  Tired, and angry at this point I called the store, they were too busy to talk to me I was told, they would call me back.  (I guess you are less important if you've already paid).  Manager called me back, told me she would give me a credit for half the sandwich, no apology.  Gave her my credit card number, security code, expiration.  Then nothing.  My account was never credited, and even though she had my phone number she never called to tell me there was a problem!  Never again, there are other Jersey Mikes far more organized and efficient."}
{"text":"Your average sandwich shop thats not very good. I ordered the a Club Supreme and the guy messed up sandwich where he forgot my bacon and I asked for the spicy mustard not the yellow. The bacon was greasy and smelled of rancid oil, I lost my appetite quickly. The bread has corn meal on the bottom for some reason which also bugs me that it gives you that gritty feeling and corn chip taste which i hate. This was my second time here and its garbage."}
{"text":"Last time I ate here it was over a year ago, as part of the Grand Opening of this location, they were running a promo where they would give you a free regular sub, if you donated $2.00 to the local Police Dept.  I ordered a #14 \"The Veggie,\" on wheat bread, and a #10 \"Tuna Fish.\" on white. The veggie was for eat-in, and the tuna was to-go (for a late dinner at work).  The veggie sub was O.K.., but I think they forgot to put on the green peppers.  I got it \"Mike's way,\" and I couldn't believe how much vinegar, and then oil they dumped on top of the sub (and I also thought the oil should've been put on first to absorb the vinegar, but I digress).  There was so much dressing on the sandwich that I ended up with oil drippings on my t-shirt (sad face).  It tasted pretty good, however, but I am not sure if I would've paid regular price for it, that it would've been a good value for the money, $6.45, and I was actually still hungry after eating it.  Later that night I had the Tuna sub and it was good, but when I was eating it, I realized they put tomatoes on it, and I only asked for onions,lettuce and tuna.  It tasted fine, but I would've preferred if they made it the way I asked them with no tomatoes.  I have not been back to this location since, but perhaps I will give them another try sometime."}
{"text":"This is one of the first places I went to eat when I first moved here.  The subs are great and HUGE!  If you order the large one then it can be enough for two.  I like the fact that they offer mini subs incase you have kids or if you just feel like a small sandwich. Finally if your having a healthy day then they can turn any sub into a salad.  They call it a Sub in a Tub :)   The only negative part about this place is the parking lot is super small so if it's busy then it may be hard to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"The \"Sub in a Tub\" is awesome.  Any sub, in a tub!  Get some ranch on the side, YUM!  Tuesdays (at least in Steele Creek area), they have a great deal, like $7 for a sub (or in a tub), drink and chips!  Awesome!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great!  The menu used to be a lot bigger when I was kid and they also had a breakfast menu too.  I still think that they have the best sandwiches around!  Service is great and they get it out pretty fast even though they slice it for you as you wait.  I prefer the slicing it fresh over over sub-way's pre-cut stuff in a bucket.  I am a frequent flyer their."}
{"text":"Really starting to dig Jersey Mike's. I've had their big steak & cheese one time and then the Italian after that. I'm looking forward to checking out some more sandwiches since this place is so great. Very good service with nice people that love to help new guys (like me). Super clean location facing bell road just west of 3street (I had trouble finding this location)."}
{"text":"I've only been to a Jersey Mike's once at another location. I don't remember it. I had a good cheese steak today, but I really wanted a cold sub, but the lettuce didn't look good. I hate lettuce that looks yellow and like it was cut too long ago. The bin on the sandwich line had lettuce that was yellow and some edges were getting that purple ish brown thing going on. I have a thing w lettuce and it has to look really fresh. This location recently opened, so I won't judge them on wait time. There was a friendly guy who seemed to be in charge moving things a long so that helped. The place was clean and there is plenty of parking/location is easy to get too.  The cheese steak had plenty of cheese and was not too soggy. It was a little bland but I see you can add jalepenos or Chipotle mayo so I'll try that next time. I will go back...if I remember to. There is a LOT more competion at this exit now then there ever was (Tom + Chee and Pizza Fire right next door and Chipotle and Jimmy John's around the corner)."}
{"text":"Worst sub I have ever had.  I ordered one with ranch, instead of ranch it was smothered in mayonnaise and melted cheese.  Ordered the kids sandwich for my son and same thing, smothered in mayonnaise.  The bread was not fresh, tasted like it had been sitting out for days.  I highly do not recommend this place.  Jersey Mikes, as If it is a east coast sub shop, this is far from the quality of a east coast shop.  Not good at all, will never eat there again, and will never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"So glad that a Jersey Mike's opened on this side of town. This location is a frequent lunch spot of mine.  The service is friendly, subs are tasty and the quality high.  The menu is diverse with cold and hot subs.  The Italian, made Mike's way, and the Philly cheese steak are my favorites.  Subs are prepared with a decent amount of meat and the bread is fresh.  This spot has a great crew making the subs consistently well.  A very clean and organized food prep area.  There are other sandwich shop options but few make them hearty and big as Mike's.  A super high recommend."}
{"text":"Love the #13 Mike's way, went yesterday for my free birthday sub and drink with my Fiance and it was Awesome as usual. Great food and staff! Its a bonus that they always send out coupons too!  Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"We literally live right around the corner from this location. First off, I can't stand greasy food, this is perfect for nights that I don't feel like cooking and I can send the husband just around the corner to pick up fresh sandwiches.   Staff is always super friendly - they always strike up a conversation (that isn't awkward) and the location is clean. The only downside in my opinion? They serve Pepsi products."}
{"text":"Day after Christmas, service was off. It took about 20 minutes for us to get our subs. We dined in. Our subs were delivered to our table wrapped.  No choice in having a condiment added to the subs. The subs were delicious. I had the #16 Chicken Philly.  My husband had the #18 Traditional Philly sub."}
{"text":"Was craving a GOOD sandwich. Originially from NJ and not too familair with any deli's or sandwich spots in the area, and after a very disappointing meal at Subway, we decided to try Jersey Mikes. I got a Turkey and provolone with extra oil and vinegar, lettuce, and tomatoes. The sandwich was awesome. It definitely hit the spot. Only complaint was that there was way too much mayo on it, but I will ask for less next time. Will definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"I am a Jersey Miles fan, but this place doesn't do the name any credit. I went in for a regular BLT on white with extra bacon. The guy behind the counter put four slices of bacon in my sandwich. This means the a regular Bacon Lettuce Tomato sandwich only has two slices!!!!!! That is per employee too.   I asked for more bacon, knowing I would be charged more ( I don't mind paying extra for quality, or bacon). My regular sandwich with extra bacon, chips, and a regular drink ended up costing me $13. Maybe they thought the B in BLT meant bread. I don't know. But I do know I won't be back to this location. I now know why the place is always empty.  Update: I gave them another shot and they nailed my sammich!!!  I am going to upgrade my rating to four stars and chalk the previous visit to lack of training. Staff on the last visit was night and day to the first visit. They're headed in the right direction."}
{"text":"How can a Jersey Mike's location have a 3.5 stars when the rest of them are at 4 and 4.5 stars. It comes down to service. There's always an issue when we are there. A few weeks ago, I ordered a pick up. I got home and it was the wrong sandwich. I don't eat beef or I would have just ate it. Today the staff didn't know how points were earned on the reward program. They didn't know about the VIP card. We were charged for two kids meals when I we had one. They didn't know how to refund it. We were crunched for time and after 10 minutes waiting for the sandwich they made the wrong one (beef again).  She said that they were really short staffed so they all sucked. I felt bad for them. Easy fix, more training!"}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mikes subs, but this location is poorly ran. Management can not be unaware because there are cameras. Either they are not paying attention to their store/employees or they don't care either. Food tasted great and good location are the only positives here. The place is dirty. If it was lunch rush OK but it was 2:30 pm. Upon walking in one male employee was sitting on the counter on his phone playing video games loud enough to hear the entire game! I placed my order with his coworker while he sat on the counter playing his game the entire time (actually whole time I ate in). Complete unprofessionalism. Trash at soda counter overflowing to on-top of counter, soda spilt over counter, multiple dirty tables and dirty floor. The 3 employees did not care to clean anything up and were very busy in their own conversation and video game."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sub shop! Courteous and upbeat staff, clean environment inside and out. Fast service!"}
{"text":"I've been to jersey mikes all over the country and have always been disappointed. But this one in particular has a lot of heart.  The first time I came for lunch, the restaurant was relatively new and there was the owner (I'm guessing) in a booth struggling over finances and buying inventory. But then he got off the phone with someone and relaxed, taking a deep breath. With a big smile, he turned to me and said \"thing are really looking up\"  I have a tendency to mask all these chains as objects and often forget about the people. I like to imagine that this man set a goal and kept working to achieve it.   I'm here for my third time at this location and am always struck by the kindness of the staff.  They really care about their customers and know many of them by name--Not something I would expect from a normal chain.  TL; DR: great subs, and even greater staff"}
{"text":"I came in a few weeks ago with my friend to get some sandwiches and the kids behind the counter making our sandwiches were so great! They were funny and sweet, and made our sandwiches perfectly to our liking, even with my friend's slightly specific requests about sauces and modifications. The service alone was A+ and the subs were also pretty awesome, especially considering the low cost and high quality meat/ingredients. Give it a try! :)"}
{"text":"This is a reasonably clean and friendly Jersey Mike's.  They aren't faster or slower than other locations.  They don't seem to be any tighter with the amount meat, cheese, or toppings.  If you have been to Jersey Mike's before then you know this is another conforming location that won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"It was good, but forgettable. It's better than subway (albeit more expensive), but there are other franchise sandwiches out there with better food for the same $. I'll probably only eat here again if I'm in a group and someone else makes the decision."}
{"text":"First time at a Jersey Mike's, the food which I will get into shortly was good but the staff had a lot to be desired.  My daughter order something in a bowl which is basically a sandwich without the bread on top of a salad.  They attempted to make what she asked for but kept forgetting ingredients which she had to tell them or ask as this was a nicer way to do it, \"isn't there supposed to be this and that on it and the response was always oh yea....\". Then the girl at the register asked if it was for here and to which we said yes, so she rang us up said thank you and moved on to the next customer.  We had to ask for a fork and knife to which she gave us a strange look, really???  From the time we walked in, ordered our food, sat down and ate our food, I was able to see the back of the place where the bathrooms were.  Being that there was no one in the place customer wise when we came in and even those who came after, no one went into the men's room yet the door was locked.  My nephew had to use the bathroom so I knocked on the door twice and there was no response.  So I went to the counter and asked if there was a key...I was told no it's open.  I explained that it was locked and I knocked several times and there was no answer.  Another lady very rudely said well if it is locked then that means someone is in there.  I explained that I find that hard to believe since I've been here for almost 15 minutes and no one went in or came out, that I knocked and got no answer.  She then replied rudely again, just go use the women's bathroom and we will figure it out later...  The food was really good and I will go to Jersey Mike's again, just not this location as the staff is not with it and are rude.  I would have easily given this place 4 stars maybe even 5 if the place was clean and the staff was not rude."}
{"text":"Coming from Phoenix for the last seven years we had Jersey Mike's at our finger tips. Moving back to Madison and only ONE exist?! WHAT?! They have set the bar for subs. Far and away my husbands favorite place to grab dinner on the go. Simple fresh food, nice staff, & easy to find."}
{"text":"Awesome sub and polite quick service today! Will take this over subway any day. Picked the chicken hot sub, great meat products, actually really meat. Not that junk lunch meat from other places. Solid spot."}
{"text":"The ingredients seem to be decent quality but they put very little meat in your sandwich. Also don't care for the very dry and crumbly bread."}
{"text":"Jersey mike's is a better than average sub shop. In a world full of sub options I find myself regularly coming back to Jersey mike's because of the fantastic roast beef!  The roast beef is cooked up on site at each location and you can taste the difference! This is definitely some of the best roast beef around!   Simple, easy, fresh high quality ingredients make this a goto sub shop for anyone looking for a quick meal.   Also, this location specifically is always clean and the workers will always smile and are willing to make any substitution you might want!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Ordering online is so easy, subs are always fresh and delicious ! Always friendly service.  Thank you Jersey Mike's in Harrisburg no better place to get a sub!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, but what really stands out is the friendly customer service from the employees. Every single employee will talk and joke with you while making your sandwich which really shows that management hires workers that care and are interested in the customers instead of pushing us out the door as fast as possible."}
{"text":"Great subs! My kids ate all of it, which by the way never happens :) we will be back with our family of 6!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good but the service is slow and the employees seem depressed and irritated. I always feel like eating there is a huge inconvenience for the employees."}
{"text":"The place is clean.   3 guys working there, two guys at counter pretty cool.  One cleaning the tables a total whiner in front of customers.  Got the italian.  Ok its no Subway.  Whoever compared it to Subway is not even close.  The sandwich is like Chompies but WAY SALTY.  I think its in the shaker they shook on it.  Verdict is still out as the salt is still overwelming.   I think I just need to supervise the kids making it."}
{"text":"Normally I really like Jersey Mike's..this location and the Trop one near Eastern are both close to work for me to grab a good sandwich.  Today I had an odd experience and had to yelp it.  I ordered something very basic and on the menu...turkey and provolone on white mike's way.  While making my sandwich, the employee (sandwich artist?) asked if I liked bacon.  I immediately told him no way, I do not eat pork, it is practically the only thing I don't eat!  I took my sandwich to go, get back to work...and he put ham between the turkey and the cheese.  I did not find this amusing, and I am not sure if it was intentional or not.  I will not return to Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Eli and his staff were such sweethearts! They provided fantastic customer service and made me feel appreciated as an educator when I used my teacher coupons. Thank you, Jersey Mike's for valuing education and thank you Eli for the bomb sub!"}
{"text":"To preface: I LOVE JERSEY MIKES!! The service here was just very uncomfortable and very below par. Definitely not \"Mike's Way!\" The employee came out of the back after we waited in an empty restaurant (ghost town) for about 4 minutes. Not personable whatsoever and a little rude. My sub club still tasted pretty good but the service at this location needs a little kick. Oh btw right after he rang me up, he went back to the back. I saw a guy come and leave because there was nobody to service him."}
{"text":"This is your typical Jersey Mike's sub shop and it's located smack dab in the middle of uptown.  Like most Jersey Mike's the ingredients are fresh and the subs are really good.  On Tuesday's you can get a regular sub, chips, and a drink for $5.99.  I must say that's a pretty good deal.  If you keep your receipt from Tues you can come back any day of the week and get the same deal again for $5.99.  If you're not lucky enough to get there on Tues then the subs for lunch can get a tad bit pricey.  A regular club sub, bag of chips, and drink will run about $10.  When you get into the $10 range for lunch uptown you start to have a lot of options at your dissposal.  So my advice is go on Tuesday if you can!"}
{"text":"We love Jersey Mikes! It's one of our favorite sandwich places and would rate it higher if there was one in Henderson. I would suggest the pastrami as its the best. Got to get it mike's way!!"}
{"text":"Love overpriced subs? Then this is your place! They're super skimpy on the toppings and also, they didn't have any wheat bread when we were there for lunch on Sunday 6/21. Not sure why my husband wanted to go there so bad but I know we won't be back! We could have dined at a full service restaurant for what we paid for two subs! Which is what we're going to do next time..."}
{"text":"So I have gone back. And it is better. I now know, (according to the senior sandwich maker) that the kid's size is roughly half of a 6 inch. That is the gauge. So if a kid says 1.5\" is the correct kid's size, don't believe him/her. The service was better too, I did not leave irritated, nor did my kids. That's a win."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a zero. It's GROSS!!!!! I've never been and I  heard the cheesesteaks were good, not true. The worker was more concerned about flirting with a customer than taking my order. When he finally did he didn't even ask me what I wanted on it and he put some stuff together and I couldn't see what he was doing. When I went to pay they pretty much demanded a tip, which is just plain rude. I can't even say whether or not it's good because all I can taste is the cheese sauce, EWW. For $10 I could have gone to real restaurant. I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"I had heard so many polarizing opinions about the subs at Jersey Mike's (people either seem to LOVE them or HATE them), and yet until this location opened, I had never tried one.   And the verdict for me...they're very tasty. They kind or remind me of a \"better quality\" Jimmy Johns (don't get me wrong...I like Jimmy Johns, but there's a reason their subs are incredibly cheap).  I kind of like that this place is limited as far as breads & toppings. There's just white & wheat rolls, and probably less than ten toppings/condiments to choose from.  Honestly, the sandwich selection here kind of confused me (as far as the cold ones go). I can't even remember what the sub I got was called (its was #4), but it was some combination of Italian meats & cheeses. That's the thing...my mom & dad got a #5  & #13, and if we would have all got the same toppings I bet I couldn't even tell you the difference. There subs were all a combination of Italian meats & cheeses.   That being said, I thought my sub was yummy. I had it \"Mike's Way\" (lettuce, onions, tomato, oil & vinegar, as well as herbs). I like that they slice the meats & cheeses in front of you that are going on your sub. Everything tasted fresh.   This location is very clean (it just opened) & the staff seems friendly (there were only two guys working when we stopped in and me & my mom were the only two people in the store).  I do think the subs here are a bit expensive (I mean, everything tasted fresh, but this is still a chain), but I'd come back."}
{"text":"Love this place everything is good . They're bread is what's set it apart from capriottis . Every time I order a cold sub from caps the sandwich gets soggy by the time I get home . Never had that with jersey . Always good eating at jersey mikes"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite lunch spots in Mayfield. Quick and tasty sandwiches with quality ingredients. Store is clean and well-maintained.  Always a hit!"}
{"text":"Employees were extremely friendly. My receipt says my cashier was Erwin. He was awesome and the guy working with him was cracking jokes while people waited. Even though it's a basic sub shop their customer service sets them apart from the rest."}
{"text":"My favorite sub place, I use to be a subway fool, then I found Jimmy John's, well I have been converted to the Jersey Mike way... I love the #13 mike's way no onions! And they have Louisiana Ice Tea!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this location can be THIS awful when the one on Bell Road, just west of Tatum can be so good?! Don't bother with this one, drive a little farther and go to the one on Bell.  This one: stale bread, less meat, cheese not melted on hot subs, SLOWWWWW service...it's awful."}
{"text":"Worst jersey mikes I've ever been to. Girl asked me to repeat the order multiple times and STILL messed up. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Best sub joint ever. My Family and I go here frequently because not only go we love the flavor and integrity of the sandwiches we love that they use clean and healthy ingredients. That is a very important quality to us given that in our home you will find mostly organic food. The staff is always quick and, although we always take it out, I've noticed the eating area is quite clean. Would definitely recommend over Penn Station or any where else"}
{"text":"My husband called the store a few days ago after being referred by a friend of his. He spoke with Shannon who completely sold us! Went in today and had an amazing sandwich! Highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Holy moly! What a mess! This location needs to learn organization. While I think it's great they're getting lots of business, it was a mad house! There were about 7 employees behind the counter, plenty for a smooth system, but they were all fumbling over each other, needed a leader. Customers were peeved and just walking in you could feel the tension in the place. I had to climb over the irritated customers to get a bag of chips, which was awkward. I just wanted out of there! Don't plan on going back to this location. Too much stress for one little sandwich I can get somewhere else."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are great as long as you go when the day crew is in. If you go within 3 hours of closing time, it's a different story. Zach and Clay (or at least that's who they told us they were) are always rude. It seems like a huge imposition to get them to actually do their job and help you. I thought it was a coincidence the first time it happened, but after three times, I'm over it. Each time, they had the open sign turned off, grill turned off, and no one was in the front of store. An hour and a half before closing."}
{"text":"Happy Birthday To Me.   Happy Birthday To Me. I love getting free stuff!   Happy Birthday To Me!   Birthday Freebees - Who would turn their nose up to free stuff?!!?  Not  I!  I had never been to Jersey Mikes, but I know quite a few friends, the hubby included, who have gone and really enjoy their subs.   So, you sign up online via Jersey Mike's website and you'll receive an email a few days before your birthday for a Free Regular 8\" Sub and 22oz drink - to redeem on your birthday.    When I signed up back in December, I figured I'd try it out for free on my birthday.  If I liked it, I would return.    So I got the 8\" Turkey and Provolone on white.  They slice all their meat and cheese right on the spot.  Nice.  Like.  Standard veg choices.  I got lettuce, tomato, onion, bananna pepper, and jalapeno.  Super easy mayo.  Slight dash of oil.  Spices.  Heavy Must---.  Wait.  No Mustard.  I had to do a freaking double take.  What sandwich shop doesn't offer mustard?!?!  You give me a choice - Mustard, Mayo, or Catsup....I'll always choose Mustard. LOTS OF MUSTARD!  Old school mustard...I'm talking French's Yellow, Homes.  Y'a'll can keep that dijon, and other fancy variety krap.  I told them to put Red Wine Vinegar, since I couldn't have my mustard.  I shed silent tears while they finished making my sandwich.   Now the tasting - A little on the bland side.  Its alright.  But would I pay almost $10 for a 8\" sub and a 22oz drink?  Um, I'll pass.  I mean, granted, they pile on the meat.  But that's still kinda pricy in my book.  Thank goodness it was free!   Will I go back?  Sure.  But only on my birthday.  ;)  Given a Choice:   Cheba Hut __X__   Jersey Mike's Subs ____ Subway ____ D'Falco's __X__"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean restaurant, and quick service! If you are looking for a good affordable sandwich shop this is the place!"}
{"text":"Not enough seating but great food and friendly service.  If the weather is good you can sit outside & people watch.  Prices are pretty good."}
{"text":"I would definitely be coming back! The girls that assisted me today were very friendly, and the sandwich was very good! Will be recommending my friends to come to Jersey Mike's! Thank you guys for having an amazing staff!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a hoagie on my way home from work because I was starving and I have nothing to complain about! Filling, made to order and quick. I ordered the veggie and it was good. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars just because the services was just amazing. From the manager to the sandwich artist, to the cashier or the guy that cleans the floor, they were all very friendly and attentive.  Their sandwiches are not bad, but nothing I cannot make at home ( and I cannot cook).. to be honest subway is a lot better. However, If you are a simple person that do not care about especial flavors then I would recommend you to become part of their club as you can obtain a free sub after you purchase 11 or something like that.."}
{"text":"Overpriced, strange service setup, drenched my sandwich in oil an vinegar, ordered a roast beef and turkey with no cheese but since there's no menu specific number for that, they charged me for roast beef, turkey, bacon and cheese, sandwich was small, edible even though it was drowning in oil but Capriottis and Firehouse are better in all aspects"}
{"text":"Here's a tip guys,  when a customer says \"NO TOMATO OR ONION\",  that means they don't want any tomato or onion on their sandwich.  Other than that,  the sandwich was good. They slice their meats fresh, so the quality is superior to many of their competitors.  The prices are a bit high,  but I think the quality justifies it.  My only gripe is they didn't listen to what I told them. Pay attention next time and maybe I'll give more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"I think Jersey Mike's does a fair job for subs. However, I was disappointed in the workers cross-contamination issues which I observed. They were plastic gloves to protect themselves and not the customer. I saw a male wipe the sweat off his forehand and then make the sandwich behind me. The employees are always touch other things like the register and then touching your food. Yuck!"}
{"text":"This place is tasty - and also should give my company some referral money for all the people they send their way ;)  I was in town for training and we came here twice. The first time I tried their Philly Cheesesteak...with chicken!!!....and it was extremely tasty and stuffed with fillings & meat.   The second time I just got a club supreme with Mike's Way for toppings. They cut the cheese & meat right then and their so you know it's fresh! That was one of the best cold cut subs I've ever had in my life. Just thinking about it almost makes me want to go back to Cleveland.   Almost......  Stays quite busy during lunch but the staff is quick & efficient so the line goes quickly."}
{"text":"This really is the best sub in Charlotte. Fresh bread and plentiful deli meat sliced before your eyes. They have incredibly friendly staff and even cherry pepsi (I'm a sucker for it!) Plus, they do a lot for Breast Cancer Research -and I love a company that gives back.   The only subs that beat it in my opinion are DiBella's in Buffalo - just because they have an everything (like the bagel) roll. Yes, you read the correctly....mmm.   That aside, order a club Mikes Way and hit the gym after- you will not be disappointed! As an fyi they also sell TastyKakes for those from the Jersey region. Also, join their e-club you really do get some great deals."}
{"text":"Just went in there about 5 mins ago and we walk in and they said sorry but we ran out of bread!  How do you run out of bread?  Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"The pros: Quality of food is outstanding and a huge variety.  The chicken on their sandwiches is fresh and none of that weird rubbery pre-cooed stuff like most sub places.  So why 2 stars?  The cons:  Pretty bad customer service.  I went in one night 20 minutes before they closed ready to order a hot sandwich and was told there was no white bread (I like wheat so no biggie) but was also told the grill had been shut off for cleaning.  I understand people want to get out of work in a timely fashion but I am sorry the grill should not be shut off 20 minutes before the place closes. The lady at the register was very polite about it though and so I just decided I would come back the next day.  The next day I order  buffalo chicken sandwich on whole wheat.  The guy taking my order did not seem happy to be there and actually groaned when writing my order down.  After he was done writing my order I made sure he knew it was whole wheat and he said yes.  On the receipt it said, WW, which I assume was whole wheat.  Then as I see the same person who took my order getting my order ready it looked like he was making the sandwich on white bread but I thought maybe it just looked white and I was wrong. I get home and sure enough it is white bread.    I usually would not care but for $15 at a fast food place it is ridiculous that I could not even get the bread I want.  It is true I should have said something when I saw the bread, but I thought maybe I was wrong and I also should have brought it back but I was just hungry.  Like I said the chicken was delicious but for the prices I expect better service."}
{"text":"Do not come here. They just kicked out my friend who is deaf and has a service dog because \"dogs aren't allowed.\" (Per the manager) They said \"I don't care what kind of dog it is, dogs aren't allowed.\" Which is ILLEGAL! If your going to be a manager of a franchise, know your laws! I will be contacting corporate as well as my friend who was discriminated against."}
{"text":"I do love their sandwiches and I keep giving them a chance but this location continues to put ham on my Orders when I explicitly ask them not to, in person and online. I wish this didn't keep happening because their sandwiches are spot on otherwise..."}
{"text":"Best sub shop in the burbs. Brijesh does a great job. I don't know why anyone eats subway anymore."}
{"text":"Great service!! You can really tell the people who work here ENJOY their job!! Fun environment(great music,clean) I ordered a Meatball sub which was AMAZING!!! My husband got the The Club Sub & very fresh tasting!! We eat out a lot and this place has been honestly the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Put people on the cash register that know how to use it!  15 min.  all cause homeboy at the register can't push the right button.  Table tops dirty.... Tv says no signal"}
{"text":"Second bad experience ... Last time staff was beyond slow and bothered to be at work...  Today the store was out of roast beef"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is a fantastic sub shop that I enjoy every time I visit. Although I used to frequent the Uptown one before it closed, I can't imagine the Dilworth location offers anything different than the Uptown one used to.   I recently continued my reuben adventure around Charlotte at Jersey Mike's, stepping in to see what they had to offer. Although it wasn't at the top of my list, it was still a fairly good reuben. Pastrami was used instead of corned beef, and the insides were full of the flavor you look for when biting into a reuben. Unfortunately it was served on a thick sub roll, which detracted from the limited amount of corned beef, kraut, cheese, and russian and threw the proportions out of balance. Although it was still a very tasty sub, I'd recommend sticking with one of the classics that work better on their sub rolls."}
{"text":"They are always consistently good sandwiches. There was a little issue the other day in which they couldn't make me the sandwich I wanted, so they comped me a substitute. That's the way to take care of your customers!"}
{"text":"I had been given coupons by someone that came to my shop. For a donation of two dollars or more, you could get a sub. I like the rosemary bread, it was good, I like the service at this joint too, they remember you!!! I hate I had to wait in line for what seemed like six years but that was all due to to the awesome deal/steal coupon that everyone in line had, just like me. They had excellent staff, educated you on what they offer and were actually, considering the line was out the door....quick. My #7 turkey and provolone sandwich was great and  I will most likely return. Absolutely no reason not to. They have this thing called \"Mike's Way\" I don't like all that but you just inform them of ingredients you don't want and the one's you do, they listen. I just wish they had more sauces or maybe I am too in the mental state of Sub-Way...anyway you look at it,  all I have to say is, Thank Jersey Mike's Subs...never had a Jersey Mike's Sub prior but the bread, the QUALITY of the meats and cheeses, all I can say is Thanks :)"}
{"text":"Subs were yummy. I love the freshly sliced roast beef!! First time there, and they were so friendly and helpful. Definitely want to go back again..."}
{"text":"They have changed too many things. The sizes of their sandwiches have decreased, but the price has increased. Their \"tuna sandwiches\" don't just have tuna in it, the include salmon and shrimp. For people who are allergic to shell fish, this is dangerous because it's not listed and most of the employees don't know either."}
{"text":"As one of our two go-to-Tuesday-sub-lunch-options, Mike and his fellow Jersians never disappoint. Knowing that Tuesdays are a popular time, we 'dash' over to JM's from our dealership in hopes of beating the Charlotte lunch rush!  The folks at this location always take good care of us and the Tuesday Sub Special is a great deal!  Typically, most of the employees are efficient enough to work together and crank everyone out in a decent time frame. They never short you on meat or toppings unlike when you go a certain \"WAY\" for a \"SUB\"...  Everyone has their go-to numbers on the board, but I have yet to find a bad choice... Even though I typically stick with tuna.  Check out 'em out and don't forget to join the Shore Points Rewards Program!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's has one big advantage over the other sub shops - their bread smells amazing. Beyond the bread smell, the sandwich is a pretty reasonable offering, but it is definitely the bread that makes the place.  Unfortunately the staff isn't particularly great, and there isn't much else to say about the place - but luckily you can just walk in that place and the smell the bread, without having to buy anything or even deal with the staff at all, and that's a big win."}
{"text":"Totally consistent subs that are the real deal compared to all those other sub shops. I have loved this place for over twenty years."}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes is now on my regular lunch rotation. And while I need to explore the rest of their menu a #13 Italian on Wheat, made Mike's Way with added \"Red\" spread, pickles, and jalapenos just hits the spot more often than not.   Nitpicks: They need a larger chip selection including more \"healthier\" baked chips besides the plain baked ones. And some parts of this location are a little tight to walk through especially if they're busy.   One seriously good bright spot: SERVICE is AWESOME here.   In short for a good, reasonably priced lunch choice this Jersey Mike's is a sure bet."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised is how I feel about Jersey Mike's. My wife wanted to go here for lunch and we needed new places to eat on the West side. We both ordered the #13, The Original Italian done Mike's Way: Provolone, ham, proscuittini, cappacuolo, salami and pepperoni. Along with the meal deal and 2 chocolate chip cookies we spent about $20.   The sandwiches were surprisingly good, loved the bread, loved the red wine vinegar sauce, and you could taste the tomatoes, no cardboard toppings here. But I would be seriously amiss if I didn't mention how they took service with a smile and kicked it up 2 notches. Awesome service!  Overall this is now on my short list of surefire Vegas lunch choices. I will be back!  Note: They do make my Payment Card Stupidity list as they make you sign for debit card transactions. See my list description of why this sucks. There is a better way of taking payments."}
{"text":"Great little store. We got the buffalo chicken sandwich and a chicken philly. Both were amazing. The restaurant is also very conveniently located, right by the Lowe's on Concord Mills Blvd. Ample seating, but parking can get tricky."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat. They weren't busy at all and ordering was a breeze. The staff is super friendly and I was very impressed with how clean the restaurant is! Our subs were delicious and the bathroom was spotless!"}
{"text":"Great service! Fresh bread and awesome toppings. Went today for a to go order and staff was very friendly! It's also a plus that they have coupons you can use too!!"}
{"text":"As always this location is AWESOME! They had 4 guys behind the counter and were super fast! A fee people in front of us but they worked together and we had our food fast! We got the Italian and the Club, both sandwiches were so good and fresh, the roast beef was nice and rare.  You can't go wrong with any sandwich at this location.  Whoever owns this franchise is doing something right"}
{"text":"I love this sub shop!   Great subs,  the ingredients are always fresh and very tasty.   This is my favorite sub shop in the area.   The only problems I've ever had were parking in the lot as it's always busy in that plaza and sometimes (at lunch)  there aren't enough seats."}
{"text":"There subs are always great, so what makes the difference at a Jersey Mike's? The staff.  5 stars for the staff working Sunday night!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop!  Love the fresh ingredients which get sliced right in front of you!  My favorite is the #7 (Turkey).  Best pickle slices around, too!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and workers can make or break a food spot, and for this Jersey Mike's the place is kept clean and the three dudes working we chill. I have been to a couple that had a shitty staff so coming to this one makes me wanna come back.  I love getting the Philly Cheese stake and I can say that they are not greedy with the meat or ingredients here. It taste really good and not overly seasoned at all."}
{"text":"Hoping I get to update my review & add stars sooner than later because the manager at this location is beyond nice.  My first visit to JM's. The quality of food & customer service from Larry on the phone (the manager) will get five stars BUT not only one of our sandwiches was messed up but after ending my pleasant call with Larry..I realized both were.  I think there was a switch up with a similar sandwich by accident; I ordered a kahuna chicken Philly-no jalapenos- add lettuce & tomato- on white..Ended up with the standard kahuna-on wheat..wasn't bad at all, just not what I ordered. The boyfriend (whom loves JM's) got a $15 supreme club that had no bacon or mayo so that was a big bummer for him. I also tipped a couple bucks as I usually do.  *****THE PLUS: Larry took our name & is ready to accomidate us on our next visit to make up for the mishaps. I'm really glad I decided to call (normally I wouldn't bother) because not only was Larry great about what happened..he was funny to chat with & we are totally looking forward to our next visit (:"}
{"text":"There is no better sub ever lol Firehouse subs, subway no no no.  I always get number 7 Turkey an cheese lol Every now an again I get the Club but their bread is always so fresh n ingredients . Best sub around , chicken is really good."}
{"text":"Meh.   I've been to Jersey Mike's once and only once. I personally help to keep Subway in business and Jersey Mike's didn't steal me away.   Like someone mentioned, the sizes of sandwiches is pretty odd. I got a 5 inch. turkey sub and some chips and a drink. The ingredients were good, don't get me wrong, but it all just tasted a little bland. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"In the past, I never really had an,...\"issue,\" having Jersey Mike's.  In fact, I used to think it was a good place.  This visit kind of has me thinking the complete opposite.  We went at about 2 in the afternoon and it was not busy at all. We ordered a Club Supreme, Mike's way.  I understand when having these types of sandwiches, they tend to get a bit messy.  What it a huge pile of lettuce on there and all.  Our sandwich wasn't cut fully, so we had to tear our pieces off of the Giant which made it messier.   When I asked for a side of banana peppers, he kind of mouthed under his breath, \"it's gonna be a long day,...\"  (I was thinking, wait a minute, is it really a bother to you to put banana peppers in a little container??? -- STFU! sheesh, at least say it after I walk away!!!)  Another thing we noticed, was that there was no bacon in the sandwich.  We thought, not a big deal.  After waiting by the register about a minute or two, we saw the person that made our sandwich come from the back hallway from where the bathrooms are.  We asked about the bacon on the sandwich.  You would figure, we could wrap up the sandwich, and he could put in there.  But!!!!!  What this guy did was take a handful of small pieces of bacon and put it in a long, white, container, that looked like it was for a wrap.  --  The problem was that, he used his bare hands.  HE DIDN'T PUT ANY GLOVES ON!!!!!!!!    Ughh,... The only positive part of that visit was watching ESPN on the television."}
{"text":"1pm today I was here and it was the first time I have left a \"zero\" tip at a JM.  The girls were working hard, but the guys were more interested in BSing with friends.  One of the guys walked away while I was waiting on my order while the others were chatting away with friends.  Finally one of the girls went to the back to retrieve the guy who had walked away to finish my sandwich.  When he did come back, he didn't listen to what I wanted.  Annoying visit today."}
{"text":"I will agree with the overpriced issue with Jersey Mike's.  Besides that...this is the best damn Philly Cheese Steak I have had in Arizona.  (I am not from Philly, so I admit I am not a pro at the Cheese Steak cuisine)  Everything there is fresh, from the bread to the veggies to the meat.  My sandwich is never a mess..which is amazing in itself. Service is great, even for ASU students working there.  Great location....Really can't say anything bad about the place...it just sucks when there is construction on Scottsdale road and it makes it almost impossible to get there.  (One day it was so bad, I had to settle for Rubios....not a good settle when all you want is a cheese steak.)"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I was pretty disappointed in the menu offerings here but I created a hot veggie sandwich with what I wanted and gave it a go.  It took awhile and we beat the lunch rush.  The sandwich wasn't bad but it wasn't really good either.  What made me the most upset was that in the 5 min ride home the sandwich had melted into a wet pile of food. I couldn't even try to eat half of it without a fork and a knife.  Very unimpressed with the bread.  And I think the fact they place sandwiches on the same surface and use the same knives between meats and veggies is what is causing my stomach to hate me tonight.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Employees that work here are always happy to see you! Super helpful and even suggested new ways of making my sub. Good came out fresh and tasted amazing as always! Restaurant inside is always clean and smells good because of the fresh baked bread."}
{"text":"I don't know if you're like me, but I can get sick of Subway. I love the concept but am constantly looking for a different menu of sandwiches. I have a coworker who frequents here often and it always smelled delicious. When I saw this location next to my friendly neighborhood Harris Teeter, I decided to give it a try.   Wow! I had the veggie wrap, grilled and it was amazing. They have very large portions and a friendly staff. The area is clean and I really enjoyed my meal. I would recommend this to people who like me, are sick of the same old Subway sandwich."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago (Mid April-ish), my boyfriend and I tried to go here with about 30-45 mins left before they closed and the open sign was off and they were cleaning. We figured they didn't want service if they had their sign off. Also figured people who do that usually give horrible service. We picked somewhere else to go that night.  Tonight (Friday, May 13 at 8:00pm), with 1 hour left to be open, my boyfriend and I wanted Jersey Mikes but we already knew that this location was weird about people coming \"late\" so we were hesitant.  We got there and there were quite a few people in line. We had to maze walk through all the people ordering their food because they had the whole store blocked off because I was assuming they were cleaning. Ordering the sandwiches and paying was great. I got a free Giant sub because I eat at Jersey Mikes so often that I racked up enough points to get a free one. The girl who made my sandwich and rung us up was the best out of the three employees that night. We were eating there because my boyfriend had to go back to work.  Since they had literally the whole store blocked off except the two tables by the door, I moved a chair that was blocking the walkway to go sit in the \"restricted\" zone because someone else was sitting at the other table. Another couple did this also right after us because why would we sit all right next to each other when there is a whole restaurant available? I'm sitting down eating for about 3 minutes and I can hear one of the male employees say \"Do they not understand that when something is blocked off, you don't go through it\" or something along those lines. He then said \"Now I swept and mopped for nothing\". He only had two tables to clean after we left because of the other couple as well.  My table was the closest to the crowd control rope thing (about 5 feet). That employee then came over and picked up the rope stand and set it down right next to my boyfriend so we can't cross into that section (which I don't know why we would have). As soon as he set it down, he shook his head at me and was continuing to shake his head all the way to the back room. I was fine with the complaining about us initially being in that section but the head shaking took it too far. It was just rude.  The whole rest of the time there, he was still complaining to his employees about it. It's one thing to say something like that to your coworkers but for your customers to hear you saying stuff is inappropriate. (I was actually fired from my job as a teenager for doing things like that so I learned my lesson.)  I really love you Jersey Mikes but you need to get your employees in check here. I will be driving to another location where I know they give better service."}
{"text":"I'm kind of troubled writing this review; you see, I'm a fan of Jersey Mike's and I would like to give them a better rating than this.  However, this is the rating they earned today.  I like this location, the place is big enough so you can always get a table.  The staff is also very friendly and accommodating when making sandwiches.  This location can get very busy at lunch; but the line moves fast, so it's not usually too long of a wait.  I stopped in today and ordered a turkey sub (#7).  Although the place was a little busy, My sandwich was made quickly, and how I like it.  I paid for it and sat down to eat.  This is when I noticed the turkey (or should I say lack of turkey) on the sandwich.  I know this is a chain, and not a Mom and Pop set up, but this has happened a couple of times at this location.  I expect a little more than 1 skimpy little row of meat.  The turkey sub is the same price as the \"Super Sub\", which comes w/ 3 different meats.  I don't think a second row of the very thinly sliced turkey is going to hurt profits too much.  At over $10 when ordering with chips and a drink, this is a good chunk of change for what seems to be about 1.5-2 ounces of meat.  The turkey is very tasty, and although it's a processed lunch meat, the turkey at Jersey Mike's always taste better than at Subway.  My sandwich was tasty, and the toppings were good, but they fell short on what is the main ingredient on a sandwich.  The review should be considered 2.5 stars, and would have rated a solid 3.5 stars if they weren't so skimpy!  I like that Jersey Mike's has fresh brewed iced tea (sweet and I sweet), the rest rooms are always clean, and the staff always friendly; unfortunately, at this price point, there are better vaules for my $$."}
{"text":"Super awesome and friendly staff! Best Italian sub you can get this far west! Get any sub \"Mikes way\" and add some sweet peppers they use for their Philly steaks. Two thumbs up!!!  I guess with the sweet peppers it's not \"Mikes way\" but hey, the staff will make it your way :)"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is quick and easy place to go to service is pretty quick in and out for a busy days work."}
{"text":"Ordered our hot subs over the phone within an hour of closing. The person taking the order didn't know the subs by their number. When we showed up our order was still being made and the person cleaning their seating area was giving us the death glare (even though we did not eat there). The person running the register did not know how to use/enter our coupon so we didn't get a receipt but our order was hot and accurate so ?"}
{"text":"We liked it! Friendly staff, extremely clean facility, nice prices and great quality of ingredients. On weekends they have a special; 2 regular subs, 2 chips, and 2 drinks for $12.99. They have a handful of toppings to choose from...I really wished they had black olives but they do have pickles! Also if you get it \"Mikes Way\", which is vinegar, oil, and spices, you should know they really pour on the vinegar. I prefer alot of vinegar so I like it but those of you who dont may need to let them know to go light on the vinegar. So if you're looking for some yummy subs give them a try!"}
{"text":"Ok, I had to review because of the Yankee review I just read.  Jersey Mike's is good, don't get me wrong.  I'm from the South and have traveled to Phili, New York, etc, and while Yankees do pretty much everything wrong, they do food right.  Yankees have the best sandwiches, seafood, bagels bar none (cept BBQ).  Jersey mike's is good but it ain't all that.  Prices are high too.  I still do very much enjoy a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Never been to Jersey Mike's. Since it was the only place open, we walked in at 8:45 (they close at 9:00). Was informed they could only make cold subs since the \"grill was closed\". Well, maybe they should close at 8:45 then.  Won't be trying this one again."}
{"text":"Good and Bad here... The Giant tuna sandwich is a mess. Hard to hold, mushy, bread can't hold all the stuff. The flavor is there but we needed a plate and fork after the first bite. I do like the Italian (#13 I think), lots 'o meat and I like it \"Mike's way\". Very yum and enough for 2 meals.  Use coupons when you can, this is a tad pricey!"}
{"text":"I've only had the veggie sub, it is never a let down. The staff cleans off the grill before melting my cheese and veggies, which is always appreciated! I'm always welcomed by a cheerful staff & their establishment is always clean."}
{"text":"pretty good cheesesteak...we tried the big kahuna with jalapeños etc...yum! It's kinda hard to get to find a decent cheesesteak around here so it's a good option."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful sandwiches, always does.  That is why I will continue to go there.  Went there last week to pick up a call ahead order, as I was paying, with a credit card, the kid checking me out showed me where I could tip, but \"no pressure\" as he eyeballed each button press and was dissapointed as I chose no thank you.   I understand wanting to tip if you get great service, but be serious you are a sandwich shop.  Is it necessary to have to say no thanks on a tip while checking out with a credit card??  What were they wanting 20% to hand me a bag?  Eliminate the tip option on the credit card check out screens and 5 stars on a sandwich shop.  Sandwich shop..."}
{"text":"This is the jerseyest Mikes I have ever been to. Fast friendly and awesome. I love the cold cuts that are cut in front of you. Beats out subway and Jimmy johns. Just wish they delivered."}
{"text":"I'll cut them slack for opening month jitters and a petrified cashier who couldn't count change from a $20 on a $7.40 sandwich   And the freshness and flavor wasn't bad although nothing special - at least it wasn't disgusting.    But I'm not a fan of places that are so chincy to work their bottom line margins that they essentially pull a flimflam like I'm too stupid to realize it.    You will get two transparently thin slices of  cheese and so little shaved meat on your sub it becomes an $8 bread and condiment sandwich.   Just make a sub like its supposed to be where you can actually taste the meat and cheese and charge what you need.    Verdict is this is a rip deal."}
{"text":"I had a very interesting experience at this location!  The girl behind the counter had a sense of humor, but it was a touch on the... ghetto side.  When I got done ordering my food she looks at me and simply says \"No, you can't have that\".  Ok, funny, ha ha.  Give me my f#$%ing sandwich.    I ordered the Buffalo Wrap.  Now, I admit, I am not formally trained in sandwich manufacturing, but this item did not sound like rocket science.  Apparently I was wrong.  17 minutes later, and a really entertaining bickering session back and forth by the staff, my masterpiece arrives.  The wrap had a decent flavor - a bit heavy on the Buffalo sauce, but whatever.  They are getting 2 stars only because the wrap was good.  Not for service, not for humor.    Best part is there was an older gentleman that ordered behind me that did not appreciate the \"you can't have a sandwich\" comedy skit and got into a bit of an arguement with the employee... to which she actually tried to defend herself.  Sorry, you get one shot - I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is really good food!  I ate here back to back days this week because of the craving they left me with!  The establishment is decorated like any other chain store.  It is clean, kinda playful but they get major points for TV's!  The ability to keep watching the Football game this Sunday factored heavily in my decision to eat here!  On my first visit (Saturday) I had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap.  This little sucker packed a lot more flavor than I expected!  The chicken was surprisingly fresh and the buffalo sauce had quite a zing.  The wrap also had a hint of Bleu Cheese... just enough to back down the zing.  I was actually disappointed when I took the last bite, the food was that good!  My second visit I had the BBQ Beef Sandwich.  This is too good to be at a chain sub shop.  This is the type of sandwich I would expect from a legitimate barbecue restaurant.  The flavors were great, the portions were huge.  The sauce had a nice balance and my stomach was happy with it a few hours later.  Very difficult accomplishment for BBQ!  The only reason they aren't getting a full 5-stars.  One of the employee's has a little bit of an off-color sense of humor.  I am here for food, not bizarre jokes.... and stop staring at my fiance!  As well, while the prices are great, it somehow adds up to $25 very fast.    Great restaurant,  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Sometimes they make a good sandwich.   And others, it's crazy sloppy with no care in the world as to how the sandwich is presented.   Today, it was one of the worse days.   Even a staff member walked by and looked at the sandwich with disbelief.   I don't have horrible things to say about this place, but the staff definitely needs some more training on attention to detail."}
{"text":"Clean, fast & friendly - that is this Jersey Mike's. Will the sandwiches ruin you for all other sandwiches in your life? No. But when your tummy's a rumblin' and you need a quick sammie in the University area, this location will suit just fine.   The folks behind the counter crafting your sandwich and taking your payment are quite friendly. They also seem to really pay attention to regulars, and I really appreciate that. Yay for kind customer service.   As for my turkey sub, it was fresh and as a regular size, pretty substantial. Get it, sub-stantial?! Hardy har har. The booths and tables are super clean as were the restrooms. All in all, Jersey Mike's has got it going on...oh, and they have Garden Salsa Sun Chips. That's my bag of chips, y'all."}
{"text":"I've gotten subs from jersey mikes before and gave them another chance after consecutive lukewarm experiences. However I got the wrong sub and am regretting it again. Their breads are way too soft to be making pastrami sandwiches with thousand island dressing and it was soggy and non-edible. the meat was ok but not all the hype they get. Again, maybe I got the wrong sandwich but I'm surprised they even make it like that. Id rather go to Jasons deli."}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes are the best subs. No precut mushed meat here. Freshly sliced on great bread. This place is small but quick. The Go Ballantyne card gets you free chips and a drink. Plus you can still get shore points rewards."}
{"text":"My review is about the service.  The food is fine.  its sub sandwich food and gets a 3 start.  Nothing to separate their food from the 100's of choices that are out there. What is killing this business and all businesses like this, is the people who work there.  It is a problem industry wide, and at this restaurant 2 times as bad. 2 times the service was horrible, I walked out the first time as an employee mocked me.  Today, the 3 people act like they would rather be anywhere else in the world but there.  I actually do not blame them, I blame the management of Jersey Mikes and all restaurants like them.   I have 100's of choices on where I am going to get food when I want to buy it, 96 out of 100 treat you like they could care less if you come in and buy from them or not.  4 will make you feel appreciated to spend your money with them.  This particular store is not one of the restaurants that make you feel welcome, they just want to  take your order, half listen to you about what you ordered, and then make you feel like crap that you ordered from them when you leave. Good Luck....just not worth this experience here any more."}
{"text":"I returned to this location today on Paradise with my wife, Ang, after having an issue with the other location on Las Vegas Blvd@ Premium Outlet mall! We ordered food online, it wasn't ready, finally got it and it was BAD) SMH!  In the past I only came to this store on Paradise.  We were so annoyed with the service on Las Vegas Blvd she actually had to call the headquarters in NJ.  Twice.  The problem was quickly resolved by the intervention of Tami Kwity.  Tami was EXCELLENT and let us know that customer service is the #1 priority.  This location (Paradise) is always, super friendly, helpful, and cozy. The food is always fresh and tasty.  The customers at this location are way more relaxed and chill.  The customers actually speak to each other and are polite and courteous.  I have never had a problem at this location.  Thanks to Jesse for making a wonderful sandwich today.  All of the employees at this location are professional, friendly and helpful.  Thanks again Tami for resolving this issue and making me feel appreciated as a loyal customer."}
{"text":"If you want to fill up a teenaged boy this is the place. Lovely owners that try to please   Meat is cut fresh in front of your eyes. Have the sub the way you like it. Big portions. Can have it heated too. Lots of selections. I like the Italian or tuna. Very fresh !"}
{"text":"Very few chain fast and quick food eateries deserve my attention.  But, Jersey Mike's is the big time exception.  Their sub sandwiches are the best by far, even over mom and pop delis.  My wife and I have eaten at several of their locations throughout the Phoenix area and they are equally excellent.   The fresh sliced meats just seem to be the difference.  The prices are right and the restaurants are kept clean.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Mikes way is the best way. Great service. Join the sub club.  I have never been a big fan of sub sandwiches but this is the best sub sandwich restaurant I have found in the valley. The service is always fast and friendly no matter how busy they are. I love that they don't have the pre-sliced meat like Subway and the bread is much better quality. They always have coupons in the Val-Pak and if you sign up you get electronic coupons as well.  Hey! If the firefighters eat here, it must be good!"}
{"text":"Ordered a giant #56 with extra meat for my lunch at work which is at 4am, so it was a few hours before I even looked at or eat the sub. It comes time for my lunch and it's a regular giant, didn't get the extra meat I paid for! I even asked the kid who made the sub before I left because it felt a little lite if it was extra meat, he said yes. Well it wasn't so I paid $18 and some change for a regular.. WTF Jersey Mike's if a customer wants a giant w/ extra meat and pays for it you better make it!"}
{"text":"You'll always find me here at least once a year for the Day of Giving. Kudos to Jersey Mike's for being so generous to set aside a day each year to donate sales to a local non-profit. It's amazing and heartwarming to see a company that cares.   It's a Jersey Mike's, you know what you're getting here. This location is small, but gets the job done. I love that you can order online and pickup (seriously, why don't all businesses do this?). I'm also a fan of the rosemary parmesan bread.   Warning: this parking lot gets jammed up and packed."}
{"text":"Ton of seating, not a lot of parking. *Shrugs shoulders*  This is one of those places where all the workers are so friendly, you can't help but have a big smile on your face when you're here. Shout out to my fellow Nikki rocking out behind the counter, slamming out sandwiches, and sending out all kinds of positive vibes!  I agree with John H, I think their cheese steaks are decent. I like to do the Big Kahuna Chicken Cheese Steak and add hot sauce to it. Let's face it, I enjoy any food covered in grilled onions and peppers, jalapenos, and hot sauce.   Jersey Mike's stores all participate in the month of giving during March. Area stores pick a non-profit and donate a portion of sales to it. Here in Charlotte, all the cookie sales go to Ace & TJ's Grin Kids Foundation and on March 30th, they'll do 100% of sales. So, go get your cookie on during the month of March.   Parking note: if the lot is full, look for street parking on the right hand side of Kenilworth."}
{"text":"NICKI !! She is the reason I keep coming back. She is the most friendly, cheerful, uplifting person I think I have ever met. Despite what some people said on here, she is not loud. She literally remembers exactly what you want if you come back to see her.   I am pregnant and she makes sure that my food is cared for properly. She is so sweet, but firmly tells everyone \"dont touch my baby's sandwich with meat on your hands.\" :) She is the best. Love this place. Everyone else is JUST as sweet. The place is incredibly clean and easy to get in/out of."}
{"text":"This is a review of the employees.  I was in there yesterday. I asked for a roast beef sub and an Italian sub. The meat was cut for the roast beef sub. The meat barely covered 3/4 of the roll. The meat was Grey and looked very dry. I asked if she could fix the sandwich. She said \"that meat is fine. Besides, that's all we have\". So I asked her to cancel my order. She said \"fine\" and rolled her eyes. She then proceeded to take care of 3 other people while I was waiting for my refund. She made sure to repeatedly look over at me and sigh through her nose at me. Finally, after 10 to 15 minutes, she walked over and told me that only the manager can do refunds. I would have to come back the next day. I asked for the managers number and left. I talked to the manager and she did apologize. I went in the next day to meet with her for my refund. She said the we could forego the refund and she would make the Italian sandwich. The same girl had made the roast beef, and it was over cooked again! I declined. She then tried to refund my money and couldn't do it. She finally just gave me cash. No empathy for customers."}
{"text":"You've seriously got to try out Jersey Mike's Subs!  The clearly quality 'cold cut' meats, cheeses and breads are fresh, and sliced directly in front of you.  Toppings are plentiful, and they even do fantastic tasting cheesesteaks and wraps.  Let me tell you, this place does subs right!  There is no reason to do Subway, Quizno's, Jimmy John's, Mr. Hero, or Penn Station anymore (Dave's Cosmic Subs is an exception-  they are great as well).  If you like mouth watering sub (heros, grinders, etc.) sandwiches, a la New York or New Jersey style, do your taste buds a favor and schlep over to Jersey Mike's!  You'll leave saying \"FUHGEDDABOUDIT\"!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is awesome!  They truly know how to make a fresh, mouth-watering proper SUB sandwich!  Tasty 'cold cuts', daily baked bread, fresh toppings, oil & vinegar (or mayo if you wish) splashed on there... the basics but done right!  Absolutely blows away places like Jimmy John's, Penn Station, Quizno's or Subway, by far!  I can see why Chris Christie (New Jersey's plus-sized Governor) is living large!  Jersey Mike's is the absolute BEST sub (call it what you want... hero, grinder, etc.) shop in NE Ohio!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is Jersey Mike's.  And that is an awesome thing.  No variance in flavors from my former local JM.  Really enjoyed the service at this location, very nice kids running the front, and it was clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"Came in and had an amazing sandwich! I asked for a recommendation from one of the workers - Brandt Mitchell - and he hooked it up! Got the #13 Mikes Way and Brandt style. He cooked the meat and bread up on the grill and made sure to throw in some red cherry pepper spread. The workers were all very friendly and the wait wasn't long at all. Not sure why this place has one star ratings. The place is very chill and the sandwiches are way better than Jimmy johns subs that are tainted with the death of innocent lions."}
{"text":"Now there is a New Jersey Mikes in Westlake as well as Rocky River! Same owners offer great service and that delicious sub sandwich!  These guys are friendly and have a very well trained staff. I highly recommend stopping by!  Still great service and great subs!"}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mikes so much. This is the only one I've ever been to, and it'll probably be the only one I go to. Every time I come in I'm always greeted with the sweetest employees, they really care about making your sub perfect just for you. The last few times I've been through Sueann (I think that's how her name was spelled) has helped me out and she goes above and beyond to take care of her customers. Definitely recommend the chipotle philly cheese steak. It's a total game changer."}
{"text":"I go here with coworkers very frequently, and not once have I walked out disappointed!  If you are tired of subway or just want a great sub (hot or cold) come here!  I love their club sub \"Mike's way\", and their cheese steak hot sandwich.  They are equally fast as subway, but in my opinion much more tastier!  I will probably be back here very soon! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. com. Very customer service oriented (I love great customer service) The subs are awesome I had the Italian sub and boy was that bad boy loaded with meats.  lol I only had meat, cheese, mayo and black pepper on mine.(cuz I am weird like that) The gentleman who helped me looked a little suprised and how simple I was. So I added bacon.  Further more I would highly recommend this place.  It is family owned, if I am not wrong. Very clean location.  Prices are very pocket friendly.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Get a sub here.. NOW!  Warm friendly welcome, a suggestive staff that helped me decide, and a fantastic fresh sub that was deli sliced in front of me.  The herbs and vinegar make it very unique.  I suggest club supreme and add peppers. I'll be back next week!"}
{"text":"Being from the East Coast we have been trying to find a good reliable, consistent sandwich shop. This is it. No frills, just good sandwiches. Fresh ingredients and bread you could just eat alone. My husband loves the Italian and the chipotle cheese steak. I love the super sub (I think that's what its called). And the sad makes the best sweet tea in town!!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and great service. I love Jersey Mikes and having them within walking distance of my house is true awesomeness. The employees are very friendly and quick and they always make my sandwich just the way I want it. Keep up the great work guys!!"}
{"text":"The owner Duane definitely came thru in making everything great. Had a bad experience and Victor made sure I was taken care of. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Best subs ever!! Get it Mikes way. Love the veggie sub, it is loaded with a divine cheese combo and tons of veggies"}
{"text":"Very pleasant and friendly environment. Every time I get a sub, I don't have to wait in line for order."}
{"text":"Funny how bad service can tip an already poor experience to the black list. There are hundreds of sub shops, I'm crossing this one off my list."}
{"text":"Walked in. No customers. One girl was taking a phone order while the other employee just stared at the tv. We asked if he could take our order. He mumbled something then went back to staring at the tv. We began to leave and he didn't even acknowledge that we were leaving. Stay far away from this place!"}
{"text":"We were here for lunch today. The line was a wee bit long (one person coming in and ordering for the entire office ya know) but as usual everything was made fresh right when you ordered it. I got the Turkey Provolone on wheat and it was good. I like Jersey Mikes better than Subway cause they don't mess with the bread. Its just wheat or white. Deal ya know? I hated when Subway changed the bread ... but I digress. There is a large flat panel tv to mindlessly stare at while enjoying your meal and its pretty reasonably priced. What can I say, its personal preference but I like Jersey Mikes and when I want subs, its my first choice."}
{"text":"First time I have been to a Jersey Mikes.  I got the #13 which is the Original Italian.  It was very good.  I like that they slice the meat to order.  The dining area has a couple HD TVs playing sports. They are on mute and music is playing instead.  Sounds like contemporary rock."}
{"text":"Yikes. This place usually ruins my order and haphazardly throws together a fast-service sub that is light on meat and sure to let me down. I know it's technically fast food and you shouldn't have huge expectations in the first place, but it just really bums me out that the best part of my meal is the bag of chips that helps to drown out the gross taste of my half-eaten hoagie.  Here's a totally selfish run-on sentence: I'm only writing this review as a reminder to myself next time I'm at work looking for a sandwich for lunch and Yelp locations nearby only to get a little excited at the thought of a good deli sub but hopefully I will see this review and not let myself do this again."}
{"text":"It's ok deli.  I enjoy calling in my order at lunch and skipping ahead of the whole line. I'm sorry but it's enjoyable watching the others who could have called in an order get cranky!  Mike's Way is the way for me!  M"}
{"text":"Manny the manager is so friendly!  His customer service was so good I thought he was the owner!  And the sandwich and cookies were good too-- thanks Manny and Andrea!"}
{"text":"These subs are actually pretty tasty. The bread is the key. Not much else to say .If you want a change from the usual pizza or chinese food this is a nice alternative."}
{"text":"Everything is top notch here. Staff, food and brand new location."}
{"text":"Love jersey mikes! Location is great, service is great, food is great... They have a great little area to sit outside..."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Noticed some poor previous reviews so i figured id add some positivity based off my experience. Who knows maybe they have turned things around since then. Was welcomed when i walked in and the customer service was good. The food was good and ingredients did not taste \"old\" as someone stated before. Although they could definitely use some interior work. At least get new tables and chairs that dont show dirt. Otherwise a good spot to eat."}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter was mildy rude when I walked in. The Sandwich had way too much oil and vinegar it is supposed to be drizzled on you aren't lubing a car for goodness sake. The food was alright but not great. This was my first trip to a Jersey Mike's and if this was the representation of the chain it will probably be my last time to one as well."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here since I work near by and this was the best sandwich shop in the area (and that's saying a lot, because there are a lot of those on Bell Rd.) Unfortunately I had a bad experience that will keep me from coming back. My manager gave me a gift card for a free regular sub ordered \"Mike's Way\" and I was super excited to go there for lunch! I checked the card to make sure that it was not expired, and sure enough there was no expiration date on the card, and I checked the fine print as well, awesome! When I went in, the service was fine. The person making the sandwiches was a little rude, but no big deal! I ordered my sandwich and some chips and a drink and when I presented my card at the counter, they said \"We don't take these anymore\" I was confused because there was nothing stating that on the card, she showed the person making sandwiches who just said \"Yeah, we won't accept these.\" No one could give me a reason why, or offer any explanation. Confused, I just paid full price for my meal.  When I went to get my drink, there were no lids and I had to wait 5 minutes for someone to come and refill them. Not normally a big deal, but after all the business that just happened with the card, I was a little irritated.  It is a shame because the food is delicious, but due to the way I was treated by the staff, I will stick to Subway :/"}
{"text":"I obviously love myself a sandwich, there is no denying that.  This is probably the place i frequent the most often.  You really cant beat fresh cut meats.  I get it Mikes way less the onions (they seem to over power most sandwiches) - lettuce, tomatoes, oil, vinegar, spices then add yellow peppers.  Yum.  Great, now I'm hungry.  Bread is a bit crunchy, I usually like a softer bread but I think the oil and vinegar need a bread that can stand up to it.  No biggie.  A bit pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"I love Deli's so I am really particular when it comes to these places.  This is a small place that has friendly service and great meats and cheeses.  Everything is fresh and they aren't stingy when it comes to making the sandwiches.  Glad to have found a great deli in this area."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is friendly and welcoming. Their sandwiches are delicious. My favorite is the club sub, mikes way! The only thing I'm not too fond of is the bacon. It tastes weird to me every time, but that's just me! Never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I came here completely on accident. I  wanted a sub, and as usual, Port of Subs was closed on a Sunday.  (dam you port of subs!)  I was driving around trying to find something to eat, and I came across this place I have never tried before.  Its right off the 202 and Rural Road.  Went inside and reviewed the menu, and thought I would place an order.  The menu has a reasonable selection, but its not huge.  Some wraps, subs, and thats about it.  I ended up ordering the turkey and roast beef sub.  I asked about the sizes, and thier sizing chart is so odd! Its like 5 inches, 8 inches or 15 inches.  weird.  I went for the 8 inch roast beef and turkey sub.  I really liked the sub.  It was tasty!  YUM on the bread!  I found it to be flavorful and delicous!!!  But, I found this place to be EXPENSIVE!  WTF $10.35 for the 15 inch sub, before tax?  seriously?  I dropped a few bucks on my 8 inch sub, but I guess the prices were higher then I would have liked to see.   I agree with Andrea that I think this place is a little overpriced.  I will say, the service was wonderful when i was there...but slow.  Even though the staff was extra nice and extremely helpful, I felt like I was watching my sub being made in slow motion.  I would eat here again, easily."}
{"text":"I was down here doing some shopping today, and saw that there was a Jersey Mike's in this shopping complex, and I couldn't have been happier.  I spent the most of this morning running errands and getting some shopping done, and had worked up an appetite.  I was to hungry and tired to go home and fix something, so I cruised into Jersey Mike's for a sub.  The place itself is clean!  Nicely decorated, with ample amounts of seating.  They have a few tables outside, but I ate indoors since it was a brisk 95 degrees today.  I went with the #9, which is the club (I think.)  It came with Turkey, roast beef, cheese, and all the toppings.   The menu listed that it also came with bacon as well.  Well, when I ordered, I told the guy NO BACON.  He was fixing a few other subs at the same time, and as I was watching him, I saw him put a strip of bacon on what I thought was my sub.  He also forgot to add mustard as well.  When I got his attention, I asked him of the sub at the end was mine.  He said yes, and I requested that he remove the bacon, which he did.  He also added my mustard, thank goodness.  Anyways, I got chips and a drink with it, and all around, it was tasty.  Not a bad deal, really. I'm glad I went!  I also got a cookie too, free of charge.  The guy who was running the register handed out cookies to us, as I think it was time for him to rotate a few fresh ones in.  He kindly handed me a white chocolate chunk cookie, and boy, was it good.  YUM.  I really like Jersey Mike's, and would gladly return in the future."}
{"text":"this is my favorite sub spot, good food, good prices, everyone is friendly and it's always clean."}
{"text":"I was driving back to my friends house that I'm dog sitting for, and saw that they opened a Jersey Mikes here.  I've eaten at Jersey Mikes before, just not this location.  I really liked this place.  They have great hours, are open late and have a nice variety of subs to choose from.  They come in a few different sizes, and are made to your liking.  The gal that helped me was really friendly and helpful, and was able to carry on a conversation while she placed my order.    I ended up going with the famous mikes, which was turkey, roast beef and all the fixings.  Quite tasty!  I will gladly return!"}
{"text":"When I walked into this place, I thought \"we picked this place over Lotus and Los Tacos?!\"  I was the first one there of course, my lunch friends are notoriously late.  I ordered a Baja Chicken wrap hold the cheese and was skeptical when she threw a brick-like hunk of chicken on the grill. After much sauteeing, I felt a bit better.  I had her add banana peppers over jalepenos so I wouldn't be breathing fire all afternoon.  Have to admit, it was a really good wrap.  The combo of sweet /spicy and mexican spices blended well together.  I liked how the cashier was about 8 years old but ran a cash register better than most cashiers at McCarran (just one example).  Overall a good lunch and I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Jimmy John's and Subway and had heard of this place many times and it's been on my list of sub places to try and I finally was able to come by last weekend. This location is located at the South Premium outlet Mall by Outback Steakhouse and Buffalo Wild Wings.   As I entered I noticed how everything looked clean and in its proper place. The employees greeted me as I entered. Since this was my first time ever trying Jersey Mike's, I had to take a few minutes to look over the menu before deciding. On their menu, they show 3 different sizes, so I had to ask how big each of them were as they don't specify on the menu. I decided on the regular size. I got the #13 Original Italian and made it a combo with small chips and a medium drink.   When you get a cold sub you can get it Mike's Way which is with lettuce, tomato, vinegar, oil, and herbs. I decided to try it Mike's way without the tomatoes. I'm used to how much vinegar and oil subway puts on their subs so I had no idea that Jersey Mike's just pours it on theirs. So, if you don't want a lot, I'd suggest you ask for \"light\" on the sauces. You can also get mayo and some other extras like jalapenos, peppercinis, pickles, etc.   My sub was delicious with just the right amount of meat, cheese and veggies. However, I'll ask for light on the sauces next time. I wouldn't have been able to take any of my sub home for later cause the bread would've been soggy and gross."}
{"text":"I love Jersy Mikes subs. The problem I have is when a fast food restaurant puts you on the spot at checkout asking for tip. I really think that's very wrong. The company should pay their employees so they don't have to beg for tips. I would rather pay 3 dollar more for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Jersey mike is always a great place to eat!!  I look for places that use high quality ingredients at a reasonable price and provide great service.  This place has a plethora of choices, some served hot some cold, all delicious. They use fresh ingredients and bake their own bread. If you like spicy they have a spicy red relish sauce, that is wonderful. I used to live around the corner from this place, their excellent food and friendly service kept me coming back.  Be sure and get the rewards card if you enjoy the food. If you like italian subs they have the best Italian sandwich in town!!  The manager Gary most recently gave us a  couple party platters at a discount for a charity fundraiser I was organizing. Nice to see a business help out a good cause.   So if you are looking for great food made from fresh ingredients, lots of options, and friendly people who care do yourself a favor and try jersey mikes."}
{"text":"I stopped in here last week and ordered two subs, The American Classic (ham and cheese) and a Philly Cheese Steak.  I normally get the Philly Cheese Steak on white bread when I go to Jersey Mike's but I thought I would try their new bread, the Rosemary Parmesan. I did NOT like this bread! It ruined the whole sandwich for me!  And my daughter didn't like the ham and cheese. She really wanted cheddar cheese but they only carry Provolone, Swiss and American. In the end it wasn't the cheese that made this sandwich not taste good, it was the BATH they gave it with vinegar and oil. I think I counted 6 shakes of vinegar and 6 shakes of oil. I've been eating subs for 35 years and NEVER seen anyone put that much oil and vinegar on a sandwich. And it's not a fluke, I watched the kids behind the counter do it to every person's sandwich that was before me in line. And the two regular sized sandwiches cost over $18! That's WAY too much for the quality of sandwiches they put out!  I've had sandwiches at Pizza Romano (including a killer Philly Cheese Steak) that blow this place out it the water!  Potbelly's is better! Firehouse is better! Heck, if you can find a Quizno's, they're better too!  On a positive note, the customer service I received from all of the employees was excellent!"}
{"text":"Went in here tonight and ordered a half Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. It was excellent as it has been at every Jersey Mike's I have ever been to. Excellent hoagie roll, good tasting, thinly chopped pieces of steak, grilled onions and Cheez Whiz. How can you go wrong?   The young man that was cooking the food and who rang me up chatted with me for a bit and seemed to have a lot more on the ball than most of the folks his age.  The restaurant was clean and there was ample parking. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The quality of the fresh ingredients really sets them apart from other sandwich spots, and the quantity on each sandwich is more than sufficient. I found the workers to be quite efficient (the line moved very quickly) and organized, despite it just having opened.  The employees were very polite, friendly and attentive. The kids love it and the online ordering lends itself to convenience, especially since your order can be customized and made exactly how you prefer. All around, a great sandwich with freshly made bread, and meats cut before your eyes. Definitely leaps and bounds better than nearby alternatives. Glad to have them in the community!"}
{"text":"My first experience at Jersey Mike's, and it was a great one! The staff was very helpful and patient, and cooked my sandwich to perfection. They got my order just right, and we're very personable while doing so. I certainly hope that I continue to have great experiences with this franchise in the future!"}
{"text":"Good chain sub sandwich chain.  You order at the counter.  Good quality ingredients fixed fresh!  Friendly service with a smile at this location.  I would come back here."}
{"text":"Came in and got the giant Italian sub. It was excellent. The two African American gentleman working behind your counter at 3pm were fabulous and wonderful. Very energetic, and are a great asset to your franchise. Thank you"}
{"text":"I love this place and eat here too often. They can have some long lines, but it moves quick. The employees are very frriendly. Love all the TVs that are always on sports. The subs are amazing. I get either the club or the Big Kahuna, both are awesome. They're definitely on the pricier sub, but if you want a $5 footlong with processed cold cuts and stale bread, you know where to go, if you want a good quality sandwich, Jersey Mike's is for you."}
{"text":"I really wish that I could give this restaurant a better review. The quality of the food is great; however, the service is lacking. On 2 separate occasions I called to order lunch for myself and my co-workers (4-6 sandwiches each time) on both occasions I was told that they would not make my sandwiches because I did not give 24hours notice. I have walked in and had more sandwiches than that made before. After the second time I left a comment on the corporate website. I was contacted shortly thereafter by the owner of this establishment and told that I would receive a coupon or credit of some sort as an apology as 24hour notice us not required for an order like mine. I received nothing so I contacted the owner again and he again told me that he would email me something. I still haven't received anything several months later.  On Labor Day we tried to give this place another try. Called in a 10 sandwich order. Nearly 2 hours in advance and was told that they already had 2 \"to go\" orders and could not guarantee my order at any point during the day as they were not sure how busy they would get later. I asked if I could just walk in and order and I was then told that if I did that they would refuse my business. Wow! I wasn't expecting that! I called the nearby Firehouse subs and they gladly accepted my order and had it ready within 30 minutes. And yes, Firehouse was busy when I went in to get my sandwiches. I am glad that more food options are coming to the area because this restaurant will no longer get business from me or my coworkers."}
{"text":"The Big Kahuna is simply awesome! Their jalapeños are ama-za-za-zing. I love this place and the sandwich artists are friendly :)"}
{"text":"the customer service here gets a 0. they don't you even when you speak to them you get nothing back.I've gone twice once when they first open and once again today. I didn't get anything today because I didn't like the food the first time. my husband got a sandwich and the bread was old and hard.  I met the owners when they first opened,  very arrogant and a turn off. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I usually don't give bad reviews, but I kind of had high expectations for this place. We went to the newer one on McKnight road and was told they were out of bread for 15 minutes so we waited then ordered. A young woman with a strong African accent waited on me, and I couldn't understand a word she said. I had her repeat herself several times and then finally told her coworker I can't understand her so he had to tell me. Anyway, After a solid 20 minutes of waiting we finally got our food. I got the chipotle steak sub and was not impressed. Too much cheese and onions and not enough steak. It was very greasy and oily too. I was starving but, couldn't finish it. One nice thing was the guy that rang me up gave me a discount for waiting long but still paid $27 for two subs, a cookie and 2 drinks. Won't be returning to this place. I'll stick to NY Subs, Uncle SAMs, or even subway. Major letdown :("}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this simple.  This place has very good sandwiches.  The people that work there are morons. I had the chipotle cheesesteak, and my girlfriend had a cold sub (can't remember which).  They were both very good, but she had to tell the dummy making her sandwich several times which toppings she wanted, then we spent 5 minutes watching her try to cut a piece of sandwich paper in half with the BREAD KNIFE (yes, the one they use to cut your bread before making your sandwich), as the sandwich was a mini.  FInally, my girlfriend suggested that the chick just use the entire freakin' piece of paper, as we were growing old waiting for her. While we waited for my sub, they made several peoples' subs, who then passed us in line.  I'm not sure what the deal is there.  They make the hot subs in back, so I guess they made it fresh.  The chipotle cheesesteak tasted great, so I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Great spot to get a basic sub - they pile the meat extra high and the service is always friendly.  A regular sub is 7\"and is enough for two meals for me - they also have giant 14\" subs and mini 3.5\" subs. You can get your sub 'Mike's Way' which is the way I like it (oil, vinegar, oregano, salt, pepper, tomato, onion), and they have other basics for subs.  A big step up from Subway."}
{"text":"This is place is AWESOME! I am so happy to have a Jersey Mike's so close to home! My youngest son and I stopped in the other day to pick up dinner for the family. The place was packed! Despite how busy they were, the staff was so courteous, kind and eager to please. The man on the meat slicer was friendly, quick and made the best looking Subs I have ever seen! Literally picture perfect. I almost didn't want to eat them. But glad we did! They tasted even better than they looked! By the way the pepper relish is so good...definitely a must have for your subs.  If you're not going to Jersey Mike's in Bethel Park you are missing out!"}
{"text":"This places rocks, u get huge sandwiches that are superb quality! the place is cool and the employees here really care! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes subs are always good only sometimes the customer service can be question at different locations.  I visited this location on 10/2/16 and it was the typical flow of this location with miss steps.  I ordered the #7 and the #8 which the sandwich maker was very prompt with my order even though he was distracted.  With a Co-worker talking back and forth with my sandwich maker that made it difficult for me to finish my order. Trust me I know how it feels to be young and working in a sandwich place.  I worked for two Subways when I was younger but you have to pay attention to the customer order. Now if this was just a one-time incident I would say anything about it but at this location its always like this with the distraction.  Which I never get these type of distractions at other locations with Jersey Mikes name.  Plus, when I asked for oil and vinegar on the side one of the guys dip his finger in by accident.  Once again because he wasn't paying attention and was too busy talking to a female co-worker.  I just know now if I want to get my sandwich and go this is not the Jersey Mikes to go too."}
{"text":"Close sign was turned off at 8:42pm. Store closes at 9pm. When I walked in and asked if they closed early I got dirty looks and they said no but the stove is shut down. I left so I didn't inconvenience them any longer. Very poor customer service in an upstanding part of town. Highly disappointed. Will be going to Port of Subs now."}
{"text":"Good staff and food ! Changes were made and we are impressed. Many friends have been here and love it"}
{"text":"Nom! Thrilled to have a sub shop that's basic, yet good that's so close to home. Service is exceptional. The place is always clean. The food is always spot on. We've visited 3 times since their opening and have been satisfied each and every time. Thank you for giving us a sandwich option that doesn't suck and doesn't break the bank!"}
{"text":"I had never been to Jersey Mike's before so when I walked in and saw them carving/ shaving (however it is you say it lol) their meats to order.. I thought that was just so darn cool.. I've never seen that at a chain sandwich shop before.. Even their veggies were constantly being replenished in small batches so it made everything seem fresh..  We tried the Buffalo Chicken & the Club Supreme wheat wraps & both were yummy!   What made this trip 4 star worthy was the service.. All the line workers were polite, friendly, fast and even addressed everyone as sir & ma'am.. The manager in the white top was super nice too~   HOT TIP: you can make any sub into a wrap for the same price~"}
{"text":"My favorite sub shop by far. More meat, more flavor, more satisfaction!! This location has been good for me just like every other location I've been to. A must have in any neighborhood! I recommend the club."}
{"text":"Just a good solid quality sandwich shop-  definitely will go here instead of that other more corporate place"}
{"text":"Tasty ingredients but...got the California Club as a wrap, and they wrapped it really weird. It was too full and awkward, it was like a box. Then as I was eating it it tasted bland until the very end when I finally hit the bacon and globs of mayonnaise. She wrapped and cut it the wrong way, like I should have eaten it sideways. And then the cup lids didn't really fit well. it's silly to complain about the lids, but it added to the whole experience just feeling awkward..."}
{"text":"First timer. I gotta say, the sandwich looked like something I would see in any fast commercial. Big, fluffy, loaded with ingredients. Very appealing to the eye. Taste wise to me was that it was just a sub sandwich. I didn't get a feel for it being special other than the bread was delicious and the sub was large.  I am going back. This I know. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Came here a day after the restaurant first opened at a very busy time of day. The line was out the door, but the service was excellent! Everyone was so genuinely friendly and also knew how to keep the line moving. The subs are generously sized and the ingredients all fresh and good quality. There are so many sandwich and wrap options. I was going to get a hot sub, but opted for a cold sub instead when they said it would be about a 15 minute wait, only because I didn't have a lot of time and I know for sure I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I work really close to here so I visit often.  The cold cut combo on wheat, done \"Mike's Way\" is my personal favorite.  The staff is friendly and remembers you when you come in.  Great quick healthy lunch!!"}
{"text":"Solid sandwiches and service found here!   I have been on a sandwich kick lately and decided to try Jersey Mikes this time. The minute I walked in I was warmly greeted by the staff as well as the delicious aroma of baked bread (my favorite). I had no idea what I wanted but did not feel pressured in any way, and was told to take my time and order when ready. I couldn't decide between the hot Italian sub or the turkey sub (Mikes way), and the sandwich creator suggested the turkey so I went with it. I must say it was a good decision. My order was up in no time and the moment of truth was about to be revealed. Well...the bread was fresh and tasty, the turkey was plentiful, and getting the sub \"Mikes Way\" with their special sauces and spice blend was so yummy.   Not only was the food good and the staff friendly and helpful, but the inside of the restaurant was clean, smelled inviting, and a decent place to enjoy a sub. I'd recommend Jersey Mikes to anyone looking for a solid sandwich and a quick bite."}
{"text":"BEWARE OF THE ANTS.... When I first got in and was looking at the menu someone else came into the store with a take out order he apparently had made a little bit before I got there. I overheard him asking for a refund because his the turkey on his sub tasted \"rancid\". There was some confusion with the staff on handling the refund, but they helped him and he left. I ordered a Chipotle cheese steak sub and while waiting for it to be made, I watched one employee struggle through making another couples subs and having to ask 3 times what they wanted on the subs. Regardless, once my sub was made I sat outside and ate it and it was pretty good. However, then I went back inside to refill my drink, and discovered the reason while I'll never go back there... While setting my drink down on the soda counter I noticed ants everywhere. There was old dried up tea from the tea maker and they were swarming. I was a little surprised I hadn't noticed them when I filled my drink the first time, because of how many there were. But then came the best surprise... When I got ice and started filling my cup up with Sierra Mist (or whatever it's called now) I ended up with about 10-15 ants in my cup after the bubbles went down. They must have been crawling around up in the nozzle. I didn't tell the staff because I didn't wanna deal with it, so I basically just left wondering how many ants were probably in my first cup of diet Pepsi. So, they lost a customer for life. Not just at that location but at all of them. If I can find a way, I'll be sending this to the local health department too."}
{"text":"I had a nice visit for lunch on my 50th birthday, the manager had everyone to give me a shout out and came to the table to ask if everything was ok.  I really like the milk chocolate cookies too.  Nice and clean, everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"Horrible experience will update later ... Davion I don't know the spelling not only didn't wash his hands but the other two guys working were more worried about cleaning and we stood there , they didn't ask what we wanted on one of our subs and  the pepperoni they wouldn't substitute in our kids meal barely was on the sub that cost a fortune while not being sliced nice when I asked my son if he will eat it the kid literally said \"it looks good to me \" A : wasnt asking you and B. I don't need your attitude.. So 26+ dollars later I won't be back which is sad cause I loved the prior owners"}
{"text":"Awsome!! Good service,  average price, but very clean!! No lard in stuff unlike the Mexican restaurant next door! !"}
{"text":"Out of all the Jersey Mike's locations in Vegas, this is my favorite. I'm always greeted with friendly staff and their Philly cheesesteak sandwich is always on point with fresh ingredients. My husband always orders the #13 and is never disappointed. Anthony is always smiling at the register and Alex does an outstanding job making sandwiches"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The meat is sliced thin and with \"Mike's Way\" it is just plain goodness.  The guys who work here are polite and really make you feel welcome.  Give it a try . . . you'll never return to Subway.  Thank you Jersey MIke!"}
{"text":"I can't even go to subways anymore. My favorite sandwich chain. This one has friendly staff and if you check in with yelp you get a free cookie. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place, I frequent it every couple weeks. The subs are SO GOOD! Always delicious. The staff is always nice. They have this delicious red relish that I always get. Maybe one thing they may need to work on is that they put on so much vinegar that the sandwich is kinda soaked sometimes, but it's so good I can't really complain, just gotta be a neat eater so it doesn't drip all over the place. Again though, so so delicious! I will continue to come here again & again."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Sandwiches are top notch quality. I was disappointed the gentleman who helped us did not put my extras on my sandwich but when he rang me up he charged me for them. I will stick to the one in Chandler moving forward."}
{"text":"This store was clean & I got my food fast.  I had the roast beef & provolone sub & it was good.  They even gave me a free cookie since it was my first time at one of their restaurants.  The cookie was great and the customer service was awesome. I like their subs way better than Subway or Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night to grab food to go for my husband and I, there were several ladies working. Apparently they had run out of plastic gloves therefore only one person could actually make sandwiches. Placed our order and the lady repeated it back to me correctly, get home and mine was all wrong and terrible. I visit this location atleast 1-2 times a month but this trip was really disappointing. Hoping this is not a sign of things to come."}
{"text":"I really tried to like it but I don't see what the fuss is about this place. It may taste better than Subway, but it's really pricey and the sandwich tasted so bland. I'd rather go to Port of Subs or Capriottis or Jimmy Johns instead. Nice staff at least."}
{"text":"I enjoy their food but I placed an order through UberEATS and the sandwich was made wrong.  When I contacted the store I was told their system said only no onions.  He defiantly offer to send me a picture to prove it.  I also offered to send him a picture of my order.  To which he back peddled and said he believed me but did not offer to fix the situation at all. I have also contacted UberEATS but I was frustrated that he blamed me. I am a very picky eater and always check my orders over before submitting because I can't eat it if it is wrong.  Now I have no lunch."}
{"text":"They got some solid subs here, especially on Tuesday for the special.  $6.49 for sub, chips, and a drink.  Just an overall solid place for lunch.  Definitely couldn't handle going here like on a daily, but well worth it to mix things up from time to time.  dmo out"}
{"text":"This place was busy as heck at lunch time today, packed! Although they forgot my order and I waited an extra 20 minutes they made up for it by far and it was the best big kahuna Philly steak n jalapeno sandwich I've ever eaten!! Great job guy's,  thank you for the dedication and don't sweat the small stuff."}
{"text":"ordered a steak and cheese sub and was given it wrapped over the counter before I had a chance to add anything to it. I ask for the extra items and was told it was a health violation to hand it back over the counter even though they had already taken it and unwrapped it. I told them to keep the sub and I will never eat at jersey mikes again."}
{"text":"Standard sub place. I like getting my subs mikes way! They don't have a toaster which is major bummer. Your option is hot or cold sub. I do like that they slice the meat fresh in front of you though."}
{"text":"For those who have never been to a Jersey Mike's before this is the best location to try it. I always expect to get a fresh made sub quickly with friendly service and usually end up joking around with the staff along the way. The Italian sub (Mikes way of course) is the way to go but there are plenty of other hot and cold subs that are great as well. I have always enjoyed Jersey Mike's but this location made me love it."}
{"text":"The only sandwich worth paying for.  I will not buy Subway or Quizono's as I think I make a better sandwich for less, but Jersey Mikes #13 Mikes way on white is the best sandwich going anywhere!!!  The best sandwich shop no matter where you go.  Have had it in CA and NV and is still my fav place to go for a good east coast style Italian Hoagi.  Used to live back east and is the only place that has captured the east coast classic Italian sub.  If you haven't had it you owe it to yourself to try it!  If you don't like it... well then... you  don't know what's good for ya!!"}
{"text":"Great Philly Steak Sandwich! Prices are a little higher than normal sandwich places but for what you're getting it is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite sandwich place. Their cheesesteak and Italian are the ones we love and eat all the time!    Tonight we had an especially nice surprise when I called ahead to order the big kahuna with the chipotle sauce on the side. When I got there to pick it up up, they had prepared it with the sauce on it. Since it was a large, my boys  where sharing it and one of them doesn't like the sauce at all. The server immediately apologized and offered to make a fresh half for us!   Thanks Jersey Mike's for making the sandwich how we like it! It was delicious as usual.  And you accumulate points for a free sandwich which is an added plus!!"}
{"text":"so the man taking my hubby's order mentions that he should have a veggie sand...why you may ask?  cause he's overweight.  worst customer service ever.  NEVER WILL BE BACK.  this is no joke.  seriously now.  this really happened."}
{"text":"Just order a #7 Turkey and Provolone. I have to say I am so disappointed with the amount of turkey I got on a $12 dollar sandwich.. $17 as a combo that I had to write a review. If you can not taste the turkey over the bread because it is so thin and when you open the sandwich you see thinly slice piece of turkey not on the length of the whole sandwich....... Than it is is not a sub... It is joke... Please go to a different franchise owner, this one needs help"}
{"text":"I come here all the time for lunch, staff is always friendly and quick to get me what I order. Half the time I don't even have to say anything and they already have my regular (#9 on rosemary parm) being made without me even asking. Always a quality sandwich. Clean store, and never a long wait even when there's a line."}
{"text":"Our oldest came from home work one evening and absolutely raved about this place so, seeing how we are always looking for something fresh and new in the West Valley, naturally my wife, daughter and I thought it might be a restaurant worth looking into.  High priced doesn't begin to describe this place. Over priced is more like it. At a whopping $15.00 a sub (most subs are, on average, between $13.00 - $15.00 for a large) the amount of meat to vegetables and bread ratio is ridiculous. First off, the dressings they use are hardly existent. Couple that with the staples of the sandwich and for the price you would expect a healthy serving of the meats of your choice. Instead you get freshly shaved smatterings of both meat and cheese, and when it comes to the vegetables you almost have to beg for additional lettuce, tomato and pickle. The bread itself appeared flat and overcooked, and unlike it's competitors in the sub sandwich market, fell short of being light and full.  The one and ONLY thing I can say that was a positive regarding my visit was that having chatted up the General Manager as he made our four sandwiches, he appeared to be a genuinely nice person - someone easy to get along with, friendly and courteous.  As for the Jersey Mike's Subs experience as a whole...let's just say for my money I will not be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Mike's Way Please! MMM mm good. Love me some sandwiches. I came in and ordered about $100 worth of sandwhiches to be delivered to my house for a party I was having. The manager took my order and advised he would make sure it was delivered on time. I also signed up for the rewards program which he advised me about. With my order, I got 2 free sandwhiches. Sweet!   The delivery came right on time with all the fixins on the side as I had requested. Great Service and Great Food. Thank-you for being great!"}
{"text":"We first went few months ago when we moved to the area. Now we come here probably once a week. They are definitely the best subs I have tried. They are worth the money."}
{"text":"The subs are always on point and the staff is always super friendly. Definitely my favorite Jersey Mike's location!"}
{"text":"The guys who work at this location are great. Helpful and polite. And the sandwiches are great. They make suggestions and will customize your sandwich for you. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 wraps for an order in.  Place wax busy and definitely under staffed.  One of my wraps was completely wrong and ended up as a sandwich.  Tried to tell the cashier but he ignored me as there about 4 other people waiting for their food.  Gonna have to call manager later after the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I have been to many a sub shop in many a place and consider myself pretty well versed when it comes to meat, cheese, and bread. This place is a joke. My parents hyped it up saying it was so great and my experience was horrible. Even if I actually lived in the area and it was convenient to go back I would not. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap. (Yeah yeah I know... I ordered a wrap at a sub shop... give me a break!) First of all, the description says, 'sliced chicken' so I think, okay great, cool, they have deli style chicken not just a chopped up chicken breast! WRONG. My wrap came with chopped chicken... while I watched them make what was soon to be a very disappointing meal I noticed that they put three slices of cheese on the meat while it was on the grill. Where the cheese went when they transferred it from the grill to my wrap I don't know because I was only able to find one gob of it inside the tortilla once I got my hands on it. Along with the MIA cheese, so too followed the buffalo sauce. How you make a buffalo chicken wrap without buffalo sauce is beyond me, I'm still scratching my head. What was the cherry on the sundae for me was the fact that I didn't realize this before we got all the way back to the house, at which point lost the will to do anything about this pathetic thing that I was charged $7 for. Our total came to around $15 with tax of course, but that was for my wrap and my boyfriend's sandwich. No drink. No chips. No sides. RIDICULOUS. Take my advice and go to Charley's, wouldn't get too attached to a place I don't think will be in business very long. The workers are too busy chatting to get your order right."}
{"text":"Love this place.  As far as I'm concerned, they have the best cold subs around.  Really great bread - has a nice crispy exterior but isn't so hard that when you bite the sandwich filling spills out.  It's really a nice sandwich bread.  Really fresh and tasty veggies.  Tomatoes are nice and juicy and still have flavor unlike, say, Subways or Capriottis.  Lettuce is nice and crisp and their pickles have a little bite to them.  Really enjoy their sandwiches.  Their hot sandwiches are ok but I wouldn't go out of my way for their cheesesteak.  But the cold sandos are really good."}
{"text":"Food is good, staff is very unorganized and need more training.  Don't seem to know how to take an order or knowledgeable about the menu  Started taking my order, then people came in and told me to get behind line cause they took the order at the wrong place"}
{"text":"How do you one star Jersey Mikes? Fast friendly service. Always good. Just as good as any other  location I've been to. I even got fresh hot white bread which is a bonus!!! Hardworking people here! It gets busy!!"}
{"text":"We ate there a couple of days ago.   The only other time I have eaten in a Jersey Mike's was in Texas, where my experience was much better.  On the plus side, the place was quite clean.  On the minus side, there were many problems.  1.  The sandwich maker didn't know what he was doing.  Perhaps he was new.  This is not a crime.   However, when he was in trouble,  he should have asked for help.   He did not.  He put the veggies on top of the bun ...not in it.  As a result,  the sandwich was a real mess.  It was easier to wear than to eat!  2.  The place was almost as cold as a meat locker.  When I courteously asked someone to warm the place up, she smiled at me, but looked at me as though I was from outer space.  Of course, no temperature change was made.   3.  The \"music\" was abysmal.   It was bubble gummer music at a high volume.   Good for the employees; bad for the customer.  Had the music choice been better,  and/or the volume much lower, our experience would have been better    I won't be going back to this location, nor any other Jersey Mike's.   Subway has a far superior product at a much more reasonable price point.  The reality is that there are many good food choices,  and this one is NOT one of them."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's, in general, is pretty decent for a regular sandwich place. This is my irate trip to this location for lunch an it's busy. I mean, pretty busy. So, no issues with the chain. One thing I did learn is that they will make ANY of the subs hot!!! What??!?!? Nice."}
{"text":"I should REALLY just walk here since it's so close to my condo, but I would make a mess of my outfit walking home and eating the delicious chicken parm I always get on a cool night, or the Club on a Tuesday lunch rush. Last Wednesday of each month you get double points but it feels like it takes forever to accumulate. The staff is ALWAYS cool and friendly not to mention speedy."}
{"text":"If you are not a frequent customer you better find out how to order or you will be made to feel you are nothing but a big bother to some of the staff! My mom and I came in on Feb. 9 at lunch time. If you order a hot sub you are suppose to tell them everything you want on sandwich before you see your sandwich and move to cashier. I didn't know this and the cashier was so rude! She rolled her eyes shaking her head as she walked 5 steps to tell the grill person to put 2 items on my sandwich. I love jersey mikes subs! The bread is awesome and the ingredients are so fresh! Service like this is so disappointing. Maybe you did order like this the time I was here before, but you don't know me. I have severe short term memory loss due to disability. Would it kill you to show some kindness? The product is great but that cashier at Bayfield location is horrible."}
{"text":"Great service, clean and fast. I know that there are a lot of sub places around here but the bread they use is excellent here.   The location is across the street from Sun Valley High but, it wasn't a hang-out so, no worries about massive lines. However, I was there on Friday at lunch and it was busy.   Nothing really different from the other sub shops but they have a nice assortment of wraps and subs in lettuce for the non-carb people."}
{"text":"My better half avoids this particular location as she doesn't consider it as \"clean\" as the other locations closer to her job in the SouthPark area.  I agree to disagree with her and I am more about food than ambiance.  She would rather stop at those versus this \"one mile away from home\" location.  The staff is inconsistent as I am sure that I have never seen the same people there more than twice.  One encounter with staff upset my son so much that he has never asked to go back.  The food is always good to me, but the staff interactions alone have stopped it from being my default sandwich place in the immediate area."}
{"text":"Great subs both hot and cold. Plus they make salads now as well. Always go for a combo and xtra cappicola. Glad they are closer to home."}
{"text":"The best subs around and the freshest bread. Recommend the Philly or Tuna or Club Sub no matter what get it Mikes Way. THE BEST."}
{"text":"I really love Jersey Mike's.  We have one in my hometown and after spending tons of loot in Las Vegas I was happy to find a sub place in the airport.  I WAS surprised at the pricing for this location.  First of all, they only have the regular size subs here, no minis.  Second, they only have one size drink so you are forced to buy a larger serving.  For two regular subs and two drinks we paid $28!!  I went to their website for my local Mike's to price check and the same exact meal is $18.28.  That's just crazy.    Besides that the meal was pretty good!  Airport food is never the same as the real thing for some reason but worthy of 4 stars nonetheless.    Finally, they do not have seating at this location."}
{"text":"I just ate at Jersey Mike's Subs and the service is what inspired me to write this review! They were polite, helpful, and friendly! I will definitely be bringing my family back to eat here. I had the #7 Turkey and provolone. I really enjoyed the spices and the meat was very good. Its definitely a wet sandwich. Even when one of the girls was on break (she prepared my sandwich) she asked me how I liked it before I left. She offered ways for me to customize it next time I come. I can't say enough how personalized the experience was. You should go there for a good sub and great service!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge sub fan , it's not the first thing I think of when I want something different to eat but I haven't tried Jersey Mike's in awhile so why not ...   This location is never busy , I don't think Jersey Mike's is the same as when the chains first came bc the subs are a lot smaller than before but still satisfying . They beat Subway and Quiznos any day on freshness , and I like the phone app, makes ordering a lot faster, get in and get out"}
{"text":"I have been to other jersey mikes but this one is honestly the best one with the best customer service. Everyone is always so nice and so quick to take my order! I'm here at least once a week and I always come back.  The staff is very friendly and all seem to know what they're doing. I would definitely recommend to friends and family and I'll definitely continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby for a sandwich spot. Fresh ingredients and good service earn a decent score."}
{"text":"Hello friends,  I'm a huge fan of Jersey Mike's. This locating its no different. No, they are not Subway. No, they aren't Firehouse. No, they aren't Penn Strain.They have thier OWN niche. No olives. No red onions. No triangle shaped cheese. No pre cut, pre package meat. However, they do have good food & smiling faces.   They have sandwiches from 4 bucks to 13 bucks. I'm a fan of thier sandwiches, they dint have anything on thier menu that I'm not a fan of. But that's subjective.   Go enjoy, TTFN"}
{"text":"I'm a stickler for places where they remember your face. (see my ED's Tavern review). As soon as I enter... One of the 3 worker's in the back yells out : \" #9- Club Supeme,  # 13- the Original Italian or you gonna get the Chicken Philly?  I LOVVVEEEEE IT!! (I like the faces of the patrons already there hearing them call out my fav's.. a la a bartender pouring a shot b4 u take your seat)  When I'm a lil iffy.. I'll just tell em.... hey... SURPRISE ME!!  I go here at least 1 a week. (coupon always).. The manager ALWAYS ask... what coupon do you have today...lmao  They are kinda pricey.. so... thats the reason for coupon!! I work uptown/downtown (what does that really mean.. Uptown vs Downtown) so I frequent alot of these places.   Go and enjoy"}
{"text":"Never been to this chain.  Service was fast.  Had the Original Italian cold sub on wheat.  Bread was fantastic.  Sure enough, meat was sliced on the spot.  Had it topped \"Mike's way\" to save time.  Turned out to be excellent.  Definitely a sub that was better than you could make yourself.  Recommended."}
{"text":"The manager is a d bag , he stares me up and down every time I go in there like I'm in a rival gang. Went in on my lunch break and waited 25 minutes , not to mention the fact that people who came in AFTER me left before. That being said team work doesn't always reflect leadership because the team is great . Always say hi and remember me sucks though, cause now I will drive the extra 20 minutes to next one since I'm use to to waiting that long anyways. Or maybe I will just find out the days the manager is off"}
{"text":"Think of this place like an upscale subway meets Jimmy Johns. This place definitely knows what it is doing. From the Mike sauce, to the meat and cheese selection. Mouth watering goodness. Last time I was here I got a #7 which hit the spot!"}
{"text":"The original Italian #17 mikes way add mayo and pickles... AMAZING!  Best Italian sub in town.   Pastrami Ruben no thousand, add extra cheese add yellow mustard AND cheesesteak no peppers extra cheese.  Sooooo good!!!!  And chips and a cherry coke, perfection!"}
{"text":"Just want to say thanks to the staff at this JMS at Stonecrest.  I was in there today for a takeout sub and got great service from all three people who served me.  Employees were pleasant and very friendly from ordering what sub I wanted, to building it and all the way to paying for it.  Best subs (veggie Mike's way) for sure, but when the service in fast food shop is great it needs to be rewarded with a tip as well as mentioned on yelp!"}
{"text":"One chance to make a first impression. Fail. 3 people behind counter ignored 2 customers then did seem to know what they were doing."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I do not like sandwich shops in general.  I am actually kind of detested by them.  The thought of paying for something that I could easily make at home just kills me.  Jersey Mike's is the only exception to that rule.  I don't know exactly why or what makes them so much better than everyone else, but I do love a good sub from JMs from time to time.  I am a creature of habit and almost exclusively order a #13 Mike's Way without onion on white bread.  The bread is flavorful and soft.  I don't even dream of toasting it.  It would completely ruin it.  Their shredded lettuce is excellent; like it's the upper echelon of iceberg lettuce.  Again, not sure why, but it is so much better than any other sandwich shop's lettuce.  Oh and their tomatoes?  Fantastic!  Always juicy and ripe no matter what time of year.  I think they may be using some sort of witchcraft because they are just tomatoes, but yet they are amazingly good tomatoes that defy the universal rules of agriculture.  They have hands down the best provolone I have ever eaten.  I actually wish I could just by it directly from them because I cannot replicate the taste with any other deli cheese and I have tried every deli in the area.  They have a shore points rewards program so it's super easy to earn free sandwiches.  Save yourself ridiculous amounts of time and aggravation by ordering on the app.  Trust me, you will thank me later.  The only drawback to this JMs is their tiny parking row in a crazy parking lot.  You absolutely take your life into your own hands when you come to Afton Ridge, especially on a Saturday or Sunday.  Godspeed."}
{"text":"For a quick Italian style sub, fast, Jersey Mike's is my top pick.  I'd recommend over some of the other sub chains, as their food is simply better quality.  Fairly priced, fast and fresh.  Great deal!"}
{"text":"My first time eating from jersey mikes and it was a very good experience.  Ordered the chicken Philly cheese giant size and it was full of flavor and very filling.  The staff was exuberant from the time we arrived until we left.  We will be back for more"}
{"text":"So, I Used to love jimmy johns, but it's starting to get a little tired. So I wandered into jersey mikes, which is similar to jersey giant in Michigan( don't know who ripped the other off first). It seemed a little pricey for the size.  That being said, the quality of the sandwich far makes up for an cost differences.  It's my new favorite chain for a sandwich.  Cleanliness 5/5, price 4/5, staff 4.5/5, food 5/5"}
{"text":"When I went in the person that took my order kept calling me mis, I have a full on beard. No high energy like the store on camelback and central. Did not ask if my order was separate. My coworkers Oder was called out. I asked where is my meatball sandwich, they looked at me as if I was crazy. I had to ask them to make it, and told them they do not pay attention. Not world class, won't go there again."}
{"text":"Sandwich was good.  The restaurant was clean.  Employees were very nice, two of them asked how my sandwich was.  The service was fast."}
{"text":"The staff here is very polite and they always stuff my subs! -could be a little better about cleaning the slicers down and changing gloves after touching nonfood items"}
{"text":"Although their xlg sandwich is a bit expensive at $13 it was WELL WORTH IT!!   I typically get the italian and they load it up with plenty of meat and cheese and toppings. I do not feel cheated, the quality is GREAT. I love coming here!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location five or six times since it opened a few months ago. I've tried the meatball sub, the big kahuna, the roast beef and provolone, along with the club. All were delicious but my favorite was the meatball mmmm...so good. If you read the menu, you'll see that the club includes mayo, so be sure and ask for no mayo if its unwanted...the employees are very nice and the manager runs a tight ship.  Tables are almost always clean, and the floor is too....the line is often long,(a good sign) but it's well worth the wait.  Don't forget to try a brownie, when they have them, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My mom went in tonight to get us some subs and came home so happy with the customer service she received here. The young girl was named Hailey who helped her and she was so polite. My mom got 3 big sandwiches with pretty much every thing on the side so the family could assemble their own sandwiches at home. She did everything to help my mom and packaged each condiment into a little container for her. She didn't make my mom feel rushed or annoying for all the requests she had. Awesome customer service."}
{"text":"Good subs! I had a #9 Supreme Club Mike's way and it was a good lunch. The place was clean and staff was quick and friendly. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Ok so I'll start by saying I used to work for JM at other locations (FL,NV). For the longest time I wouldn't go near another franchise (Subway, Quiznos, etc). Lately however, I find the prices at JM to be rediculous for some of their sandwiches. $10 for a giant?! Seriously? They used to be 8 bucks. For someone like me who gets their philly steak with just cheese and onions it makes for a pretty measly sandwich. We used to throw in a little extra meat if someone didn't want any other toppings otherwise the meat gets lost in the bread.  This location is by far the worst I have ever been to. The employees at McDonalds and Taco Bell have a higher IQ and a better attitude. Ordered a philly steak with just onions. How easy is that? Not easy enough I guess. Luckily I was watching and noticed her throw on peppers instead of onions. I would understand if it was a busy day and there was a line of people with lots of orders how it can get mixed up but the store was empty and I was the only person there. There were other employees hanging out on one side of the store talking loudly with either friends or co-workers cursing, making out, etc.  One of the girls even mentioned loudly how she had to go pick up her mom from prison bc she just got released. (lol)  Anyway- the food is still good quality but make sure if you are going to go to any JM find a coupon first. Lots of BOGO coupons and stuff out there. Def worth it if you get a BOGO."}
{"text":"Worst bread I've ever had at a Jersey Mike's. Honestly, I never had a sub that was so bland. I can't imagine that this particular location will be around two years from now."}
{"text":"The subs are good and hot. The inside is a mess. No napkins at the tables. Trash can is overflowing. The tables themselves and seats were dirty. The service was slightly slow. Since it's a new restaurant and hopefully the bugs will be ironed out, but for right now I can't really recommend it unless you get it to go."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good sandwiches. I appreciate having my deli meat sliced in front of me because I know it's fresh. The rest of their ingredients always looks fresh as well. Quality ingredients is really what makes a good sandwich. Even when it's busy the level of customer service don't suffer. Also on Tuesdays they offer a great sandwich, chip and drink deal for $6.49!"}
{"text":"Got terrible service and attitude from zombies behind the counter.  The food is good just don't expect any with a brain stem to help you out.  At least they they so stupid they under charged me.... at least that's a plus."}
{"text":"Yo!  30 freakin' minutes from the time I walk in the door til' I'm draggin' my keester back out.  That don't sound half bad until you figure I didn't eat yet!  Yo!  I ain't yankin' your sausage either!  30 minutes through the line and waitin' for the freakin' food!  I called ahead and they said it would be faster to just come in!  How you like that?  Then I get back to the office and one of the freakin' sandwiches ain't even what I freakin' ordered!  You gotta be freakin' kiddin' me!  This was a one star review until the sandwich was pretty good, know what I'm sayin?  Hey, did you talk to da guy about dat thing?  You know dat thing I told you about?"}
{"text":"Came in to this location after shopping at target next door. Had the  California avocado club sandwich, it was amazing! Employees were super friendly and helpful, made me a fan of this sandwich shop for sure!"}
{"text":"Just opened. Cashier went out of tlhis way to get us a discount. Sandwich was comparable to other Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Can't thank the person who answered the phone today enough.  I'm in California trying to order food for a family who just lost their Dad/Grandpa.  She took the time to tell me which restaurants in the area deliver and had good food.  All employees should take the initiative to represent their company and community so well.  I just wish I had gotten her name!  I'll be supporting one of your stores near me soon."}
{"text":"Only giving 2 stars because the Subs do taste great. How ever they have a Brown haired girl with glasses that I usually see after 5pm. She had to be one of the most unpleasant people I've ever had to deal with in a food establishment. Never smiling or friendly ever. When I try telling her light mayo and simple request like that she has attitude with bitch face. I never usually do a review on food establishments unless I've been their a few times already. On my most recent visit I asked for 2 sides of pickles in stead of 1 because my 2 year old was with me and loves their pickles. The girls responded \"YOUR KILLING ME\" but then gave me the 2nd container of pickles. Seriously who says that to a customer that buys 2 giants subs at a time for my girlfriend and I. This girl is no joke rude & sassy toward me every time I come in. So hopefully the district manager can replace the girl with glasses & brown hair because I now drive farther to 101 & Frank Lloyd Wright location so I can have pleasant experience at Jersey Mikes again"}
{"text":"Wow. Smallest water cups I've ever seen in my life (they're as big as shot glasses). The subs are fairly good, but they cost so much money that it's not really worth it."}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes subs are always great! They are a little pricey but"}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mikes.  I ate Jersey Mikes in Jersey back in the 80's.  Was wondering when it was going to go coastal.  Best sub sandwiches."}
{"text":"I am always pleased with my food. They are just pricey which limits how often I go. The toppings are fresh and plentiful. I always have it \"Mike's Way\". The seasoning with the oil and vinegar set off my sandwich every time. The meat is freshly sliced too which means it won't be dry."}
{"text":"The employees were super kind, which is always a big plus for me; especially the first time I order at a specific chain of restaurant. Very happy with the freshness of the ingredients, and the price is fair. Would definitely recommend. I was in and out in under 3 minutes for a to-go order of 2 subs. They offer online ordering but the workers are efficient enough that you can just go in and make sure you get what you like."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly, always! They make sure your order is correct even when they are in a hurry. Always a great meal."}
{"text":"It was my first time there, both girls were very friendly and helpful! food was good, but service ranks higher with me! and they were great! We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhhhhhhhh about this place, I can write & write million little things about jersey Mikes. MY ALL TIME FAVORITE SUB PLACE IN THE WHOLE Wide world lol. My favorite, the Club Tuna & the Italian. The best way is the Mikes Way, I just really wish they didn't have so many different ppl working there. I feel like the employees can be a lil bit more professional but the subs comes out looking delicious & tasty. I have been going to this jersey mikes for last 4 years & I have seen customer service went from bad to good. I swear the food saves this place guarantee every time."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak I've ever had!"}
{"text":"So, this chain is amazing. I love their hot subs! For me the #55 Big Kahuna is life!. Try their new awesome breads."}
{"text":"Always good and a super friendly staff! Have not had a bad lunch there yet. It can get a little crowded around lunch time and parking can be somewhat limited at that time. If you get there a little early its very quick."}
{"text":"Polite personable staff. The store is always clean. I eat here everyday because of the fast and perfect costumer service."}
{"text":"Over the weekend, I stopped in for a quick lunch. I haven't heard much about the subs here so I didn't have any expectations.   Food:  The meat is sliced right in front of you. They also make substitutions if you ask. We ordered 3 subs. 2 hot, 1 cold. Roast beef (cold), Cheese steak and Pastrami Reuben. I wasn't hungry while I was there so I ate it later when I got home, I had the Pastrami Reuben. As far as Reuben's go it's not the best. In my opinion the texture of thinly sliced pastrami doesn't go well in a Reuben. It also needed more cheese, sauerkraut and sauce. I didn't get to try the other subs, but seems like the cheese steaks are a more popular choice and I will go for that next time I'm here.   Service: The main guy serving & slicing the meat was personable and friendly. He checked on us while we ate and before we left. That's what I call great service. I'm assuming he's the manager.   Looks like a popular place, there was a long line when we entered. More people coming in as we ate. Subs came out faster than expected. The guys working the line kept it moving quickly.  2017 Yelp Challenge Review #5"}
{"text":"Very overpriced subs. And I mean VERY. And the wait staff could really use some tips on customer service.  It's really sad that this country has gone so deep into customer service jobs and this is the best we can find to do these jobs."}
{"text":"I AGREE WITH BETSY this is a bad jersey mikes the manager is not nice. they put the wrong sauce on my cheese steak it was nasty and so was he arguing with me and said to return it it was lunch at work I couldn't so I had to eat it weird hot sauce on it nasty and so was he"}
{"text":"Love this location for good subs, fresh and made to order, and helpful and friendly servers.   Appear to be local kids who want to do a good job and leave the customer with a smile on your face.   Always the fallback when we want something last minute with no time to cook but definitely don't want the \"fast food\" places.   It's fast but really good with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"The subs were a little more money than Subway but worth the price.    This place is in a new urban development that looks great. However, this restaurant is a bit noisy and the staff had to yell to get my order (I personally don't like getting yelled at before I eat... I need soft, calm voices).  WHAT DO YOU WANT TO ORDER!!! I'll take a soft and calm sub please.   The food was great, the bread was my favorite because it was fresh and very soft (fluffy clouds from heaven); I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Jersey Mike's coming from Seattle. I was pleasantly surprised to find this location so close to home. Not much to say specifically about this particular outlet other than the service is friendly, and it seems like their bread is always a tad fresher than elsewhere. I'm a regular now and haven't had a bad experience here yet."}
{"text":"I tried Jersey Mike's Subs today and was really satisfied. I was impressed that they cut the meat fresh and the bread was delicious. If you get your sandwich \"Mike's way\" you'll be really happy. The seasoning and vinegar combo is delicious. The people working were friendly enough and I enjoyed their butt rock choice of radio station. The only complaint I have is that they didn't have a whole lot of toppings to choose from. I'd prefer to have pickles and olives on my sandwich, but it was delicious regardless. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I love jersey Mike's food is always amazing and this location was no different but the reason for the 2 star for here was the customer service they didn't seem very happy"}
{"text":"Clean and friendly staff but they are chintzy. I ordered a mini mikes way and it was so flat and had barley any meat on it. I've had better quality at other locations around town."}
{"text":"This place really fell apart since the new ownership. The play inappropriate hip hop music loud, talking with friends that came in and ignored customers, out of onions, and took forever to replace the lettuce. The young girls talking about weed. The only person doing his job good was the young male."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's has its own little atmosphere. The customer service is great and the workers are really friendly despite what other reviews may say. I've been here at least 3 times so far. I've tried the turkey & provolone and the Italian sandwich (only cold sandwiches). This is like a lower quality version of Subway to me and the sandwiches are pricer. A regular 6 inch is almost $6 compared to Subway at about $4+ The bread can be kind of dry. I suggest getting it \"Mike's way\" which is the addition of vinegar, oil, and some spices. Despite the sandwiches being a little sub par and not having much to offer they are still very fulfilling. For a female I definitely would recommend getting the regular.   Something about this place, I'll be back."}
{"text":"FYI: This is NOT your avg fast food sub!!! Jersey Mike's blows Subway out of the water. For what it is (a fast food sandwich joint) it hits all the marks. The bread, the meats, and the veggies are all unbelievably fresh. The staff is very friendly, and the prices are right.   Overall, if you're looking for a quick place to grab a sub, Jersey Mike's is the way to go."}
{"text":"If I'm int he mood for a good Italian sub, I come to Jersey Mikes. Not only do they slice all of the deli meat right in front of you, but the ingredients are always fresh. There are locations all over the valley, but this review is for the Camelback/Central restaurant. The staff was extremely friendly, the place was clean, and I got a FREE COOKIE just for checking in!   Overall, Jersey Mikes is where you should go if you want an Italian sub. Wayyyy better than Subway"}
{"text":"We love Jersey Mike's everyone is so nice and the food is delicious! We eat here a lot and have always had the best service. We've been at all different times of days and have had different people help us and each time they take great care of us."}
{"text":"I had neve even heard of one of these things before, and she, being much more adventurous than I, decided she had to try one. I had a few bites, and I have to say, this was one tasty ass sub. I'm assuming it was pricier than most because it was at the airport, but even if it was't it was ten times better than, say, subway. At least the Philly Cheese steak was.  She said she watched them slice it all up to order nothing out of assembly line bins. It was moist and the bread was soft. Anyways, I am in Nor Cal and had never heard of one of these joints before. I'm a fan. If there is one close by, I'd have it again."}
{"text":"So....ok. I've been going to Jersey Mikes since the opened a location on Cheyenne and Durango. I've always liked their food and the newly trained employees made great sandwiches. Me and my partner just moved to the Henderson area and we've adopted the S. Eastern Ave. location as our new Jersey Mike's location. I've gone there a few times after 8 and I have been greeted w/ an attitude every time, though I mention nothing; the sandwich's where fine and I choose my battles, until tonight.   I called in to make a to-go order at 8:30 for one regular tuna. Bella answered the phone w/ a fair tone. I asked to place a to-go order and she handed the phone to her male co-worker; a stale \"Hello\". He couldn't hear me over the phone, so he yelled something and hung up. I called back and the boy had picked up and proceeded to ask me what I wanted w/ an obvious attitude in his voice. I told him the sandwich I wanted and he asked me what size. I asked him what sizes of sandwiches they had and he replied, \"Man, if you're gonna..\", and hung up the phone. I drive down there to get a name and get my parter and I some food and I wait in line w/ no greeting, of coarse, and I asked the boy his name; Sawyer. I tell him I'm they guy he hung up on twice. The then tells me he had a five person line, smirked, and said, \"Sorry\", which is no excuse to hang up on someone twice. I told him when I was paying that his day was almost over, there was no reason to be so rude. He then tells me, \"Whatever, man. Looks like your having a bad day.\" I wanted to scream, though that would solve nothing. I got both employees names, obviously, as well as the managers name.  Now I'm home and I'm reading similar reviews about the rudeness of the employees there and I'm just offended at what went down. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the food is decent if it's not made w/ angry hands, which lately they have been. I have seen Sawyer the times I've been and he's honestly always seemed sour, and after reading some of these reviews, it seems he feels he can freely get away w/ blatantly rude behavior. My partner goes at different times and has good service so he will continue to go. I, on the other hand, will be talking about this for a good second. Truly disgusted and let down.   *UPDATE*   The owner of the franchise contacted me w/in hours of my experience and he offered to take several different actions to rectify the situation. I will not be going into the sandwich shop for while if at all, but my partner will continue to order food from this place. It has good food and good experiences each time he's visited. Thank you to the owners who promptly got back to me."}
{"text":"Love Jersey Mike's.  They may be a little pricier than the competition, but the quality blows away that of any commonly named dads, underground forms of mass transit, or people who used to have really creepy rat-monkey things in their commercials.  This one is new to the area.  They are quick, incredibly clean, and family friendly.  They gave our kids a Jersey Mike's beach ball on opening week.  I dig the turkey or Italian if you're going cold... but the cheese steak is hard to beat.  The cheese is just ridiculously tasty.  It's unlike anyone else around.  Go for the cold ones Mike's way & add mayo.  Only order the giant if you are a gaint.  These dudes pile on the meat.  The cookies are good, too."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches and meats, never frozen, has a great red relish sauce.  Love all the Subs, Alicia owner if Central ave store in Phoenix, is great Aaron grn mgr and Mike and crew are great. A must to go and real Ice tea."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly service. Not busy at all on Sunday. The subs are always consistent and delicious. They tend to be a little pricey, but worth it. Easy and convenient location and parking."}
{"text":"Great East Coast Italian subs! Order your sub, \"Mikes Way\"....it's great! Friendly owners and staff, go out of their way to be friendly and personable. In fact, my young son is such a fan they recognize him when he comes in. His dream is to work at Jersey Mikes when he turns 16 so he can eat Jersey Mikes every day! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I Luv this place. Fast friendly service and very fresh bread. I eat their at least twice a week, no more subway for me.... The store manager is awesome..."}
{"text":"Called I'm a order was ready right when I walked in.  The kids in there have awesome customer service. The sandwich prices were a Lil steep but overall I would go back."}
{"text":"Not a big Yelp reviewer, but this place is pretty damn good and the employees are fricken great. I thought they deserved a great review. My whole family loved the sandwiches. The Original Italian was excellent."}
{"text":"If I had all of the sub chains lined up, I would pick Jersey Mike's. Why? Because none of the others have better tasting bread or higher quality meats.   I only need one sandwich from here to be happy: the Italian on wheat, \"Mike's Way\". Boom. That's it. It was founded by an Italian, so obviously that sandwich is great. I have not had a better Italian than the one here (it must be dressed Mikes Way though!).  I give this 5 stars with no hesitation."}
{"text":"I always enjoy their sandwiches... but you need to clean your bathrooms!! Looks like it hasn't been cleaned and I am probably the first customer of the day to use it.  Gross!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's has the best subs in Charlotte. I like how they cut their meat and cheese in front if you. A clean environment and nice staff makes for a great place to eat lunch!"}
{"text":"This is your typical Jersey Mikes sub shop.  I am a big fan of Jersey Mikes in general since their subs remind me of the subs I got growing up in NY.  My favorite way to get my sub done up is \"Mikes Way\" with no onion - Lettuce, Tomatoes, Vinegar, Oil and Spices.  If you want a quick cheap lunch that is fresh, this is totally the way to go.  On Sunday, kids eat free at this location btw!"}
{"text":"I love the Jersey Mikes on Bell and 44th street so when I needed lunch for myself and my coworkers, I was excited to introduce Jersey Mikes to them. The nearest was this location off the 101 and Frank Lloyd Wright. First off, finding parking was horrendous. Ended up having to park by Starbucks and walking to get my order. Long line and even though I had ordered through my app, the employee was slow to acknowledge my mobile order and get me my sandwiches. When I get to work, order of course is wrong and none of the Philly cheesesteaks had cheese. Bread tasted old and meat was lukewarm and very dry. Very disappointed I wasted my money at this location. I guess I'll just make the drive to the one on Bell next time I want to get a jersey mikes sub."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  I heard that JM's was one of the better subs, but I disagree; at least here.  The staff was cocky and didn't know the business. For example, when asking for water, he said he didn't have any but could give me some water from the sink.   I spent nearly $60 for 4 cold subs to go with one side and no drinks. By the way, as I was leaving I saw bottled water in a cooler.  I pointed it out and his response was he forgot it was there."}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes got it going on! They remind me of the subs in Miami..I guess they are like East coast subs..the real deal. I do like them toasted tho. In Miami most submarine sandwich places have pizza ovens and the will stick them in closed and toast the outside of the bread upon tequest. So I have to take it home and stick it in my toaster oven...they won't toast them at the store for you!  Big bummer"}
{"text":"My wife received a \" get a free sub and drink\" flier while shopping. When she came home, my response was \"sure, you'll get 2 pieces of bread and a slick of turkey\".   To my great surprise, it was a rather large sub, a small drink and a bag of chips, as advertised, $0.00  While it's hard to turn down free food, the phrase, you get what you pay for, always comes to mind.   The sub was great, the people at the counter were nice, and \"professional\", not the typical \"fast food\" type attitude, you might expect.   I would rather spend my money here, than at that \"other\" sub joint, as it is just better, and more bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain sub, but when I have about 20-minutes to scarf down sustenance, this has become a go-to spot. For me, the most important parts of a sandwich are the bread and the selection of toppings. At Jersey Mike's, they slice the meat up fresh, and they recently added a pepper mix to their topping line up. I will say that beyond the pepper mix, the topping selection is not mind-blowing. However, the toppings they do have are fresh, and I do really like the bread. It's like a delicious pillow.  For the longest time, my standard order was a turkey sub, but recently we've been going with the chicken philly because we want a hot meal. No, they don't use whiz. It's not close to being an authentic experience, but the flavor is darn delicious. They actually have a griddle where the grill up the ingredients.  Add all of this up with some super friendly service, and you've earned a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Nice and new.  Never been to a Jersey Mike's, so we stopped after a round of golf because we only had time for a quick lunch.  Service was fast.  Meat and cheese was cut for your order.  The bread was ok and you get more meat than most other subs places.  Had the Italian sub, which was good, but I prefer my Italian to be cooked."}
{"text":"One of the best fast food sandwich places you could go to. The number 13 sandwich which is their Italian is the best make sure you get it Mike's way with the cherry relish very good. The workers at the station seem to get to know you if you go there really nice people."}
{"text":"Does Jersey Mike's Sub at the corner of Warm Springs and Las Vegas Boulevard does a great job and has excellent service every time I go in a matter which Sandwich Artist is helping me out. I stick with the cali Club but I've also got in the Italian and if you get the Italian I personally would get it grilled because that seems to bring out the taste a little bit more and I like it warm as well. They normally aren't too busy in the middle of the day but if you go during busy hours I would expect to wait."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches. Kimfa bummed the one on McDowell closed as I live close to that location and have not had such great service with the one on camelback. Have gone there several times and it just seems like they don't listen cause they try and make my sandwich with items I specifically have to tell them repeatedly not to put on my sandwich. And has been made on the wrong bread. Great food when you can get them to pay attention to how you want your sandwich."}
{"text":"Oh boy. This used to be a good spot to eat. Not after today. When I filled my soda at the fountain there were 3 complimentary ants included. Not the end of the World but when they gave me a bottle instead after advising them of the ant problem they didn't shut it down and clean it at all! Just continued to sell to unsuspecting customers. Gross. I'll be contacting County Health to report. Things happenband I understand, but not cleaning up immediately is inexcusable."}
{"text":"If there's anything to be said about Jersey Mike's, it's that the food is always fresh, delicious, and just the right amount.  My go to is the #8.  Whatever you end up getting - turkey, ham, salami, (definitely try the prosciutto); the meat is light, fresh, tasty, and doesn't leave that heavy feeling in the pit of your stomach.  White/wheat bread for the base, and then get it Mike's Way! for all the fixin's and oil & vinegar.  Hits the spot everytime, and at $6-8 it ain't cheap as far as subs go, but Jersey Mike's definitely has its own niche in subs."}
{"text":"I had come late, 10 minutes before closing time. Considering Sheray and Jackson staff members of JMS had more than likely worked full shifts that day, both were welcoming, professional and courteous. Typically I would have expected to be told \"sorry we are closing\". Exact opposite! My order was taken and prepared with a smile. JMS you are very lucky to have employees such as Sheray and Jackson. I sincerely hope Corporate gets to read this review and gives recognition commending these two. BTW, the subs were second to none, awesome"}
{"text":"I come here maybe 3 times a week. I love the club sub mikes way. The service is very quick. I always come on my lunch break, and I'm able to get back to work with much time to spare."}
{"text":"Always Fresh and Fast! Philly is hot and fresh and The tuna is alabacore not that Cheap dark tuna at subway and most places!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place for subs. This location is extremely close and convenient for me. Also, the staff at this location is always respectful and upbeat. Super Sub, Mike's Way is the way to go. The hot subs are very good as well."}
{"text":"A few days back we went and picked up 3 subs (I believe 1 was free) for $28 + goodies & Tax. 2 of the 3 sandwiches were fine however the easiest 1 to make of all 3 (turkey with mayo & lettuce) was pathetic,The ends were OK but the middle pieces didn't have enough turkey on it to fill the little plastic cups they give you with the small amount of condiments in them,We have been loyal customers but this sucks.Perhaps the worker behind the counter should not be flirting with A.S.U West students when they come in..This one will cost you a customer (bye bye) and hello homemade where I wont have bread and water."}
{"text":"Have their club Mike's style....add extra rep pepper paste and you are on your way to sub goodness."}
{"text":"What a crazy place (in a good way)!  From order to payment, things move along quickly, so pay attention - especially if it's busy.  I learned on the fly and did okay.  The regular sub is more than filling.  You get to watch them slice the meat as they prepare your sub - no prepacked Oscar Meyer meat slices here...  And there's plenty of it!  Lots  of content to these subs, so come hungry!  Speaking of \"plenty\", let's talk about flavor.  The italian sub I got was rich in flavor.  I seemed to be able to pick out the taste of each meat on the sub (read:  The spicy stuff didn't wash out the bland stuff...).  The staff were high-energy and willing to help you, even suggesting which subs are widely accepted as \"the best\".   They encourage \"the juices\" (olive oil, seasoning, dressing), as that's how Jersey Mike likes it.  I'll go here again (and again...)  If I can find a coupon, I'll hurry back!  It's a little pricier than other sub shops (not by much), but you get plenty for what you pay for."}
{"text":"I love all the Jersey Mike's locations, but the manager of this one is extra-friendly and keeps the sandwich assembly line movin'!"}
{"text":"Cold bacon. That is the only reason for a 4 opposed to a 5. I stood there while waiting in line, staring at a silver tub of steaming hot bacon on the bottom of that tub yet they gave me bacon from the top of the tub. If they always give people bacon from the top of the tub, then nobody will ever get hot bacon! If I'm going to eat bacon (not often), then I want that sh*t hot! Sorry, tiny vent.   That's not my only vent. On the way in, five guys (not Five Guys looking to start beef with Jersey Mike's) dressed like they were going to play golf saw me approaching and still made sure they got ahead of me. Maybe it's just me, but if it's just one person approaching from the other side and you are a group of five, it would be courteous to let the solo person enter first. No big deal, though. Not a real-world problem.   I will tell you about a real-world problem, though: Road Rage. Not me, but some other aggressive driver in a Ford 150 that cut me off while I was exiting the parking lot. This led to me spilling mayo on my t-shirt. Due to this event, and since I was also eating Cheese Doodles, I gave the Ford 150 driver The Cheese Doodle Finger. That's right, cheese covering the entire tip. He must have been devastated. I win.   As far as the sandwich goes, it didn't blow my mind, but it was solid.   Forgot to take a picture on this one. Too many distractions. My bad."}
{"text":"Despite living in Huntersville, I hand't been here since 2008 because I didn't like it that time. I remember saying to myself: Never go back! But, eight years later, I decided to give it another shot.   I went on a Sunday at around noon and there was a long line. Unfortunately, there isn't much room for a long line, and you're always moving to let the takeout or dine-in people go by. The floors are an absolute mess, which indicates poor management.   Here's what's really crazy. I spotted a tin of bacon, which couldn't have been hot because it was sitting there the whole 15 minutes I was waiting. I asked if they had hot bacon. The guy behind the counter said, \"Not today.\" I said, \"So ... there's not hot bacon today?\" His reply, \"Right.\" He nodded, and I could tell he was overwhelmed by the crowd and had no interest in helping just one customer. On top of that, there was a red substance in the mayonnaise container, only at the edges but relatively deep. And the price is too high for the portion.   On the positive side, the turkey is high quality. But that's the only positive."}
{"text":"It was 8:54, and they closed at 9pm. I entered the doors, thinking that they closed at 10. I apologized for possibly ruining their night and forcing them to stay a little longer to make my food. I offered to leave and to let them be, but the three of them demanded I stay.   I said okay, and ordered my food. I asked if they were allowed to accept personal tips as I am asking this personal favor of them to make these amazing wraps, that my pregnant wife was so fond of.   You see, my pregnant wife, was the reason I was there so late and I greatly appreciated how awesome they were in welcoming me in my time of need. They were all awesome, and made me welcomed while I was there. Made amazing wraps and I couldn't thank them enough. If a 6 star rating was possible, I'd give it to the three of them. The female manager, and the  two male workers that I failed to get the names of. Please accept my apologies, and I will see the three of you again. Thank you."}
{"text":"We love this place!  We are regulars here, and every time we receive outstanding service from Anthony, the manager.  As busy as it gets, he always takes the time to talk with us; he knows us by name and order!  The restaurant is always very clean and the food is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Been gluten free and haven't been able to eat Jersey Mikes for a while which was sad. Now they have a gluten free sub option so i went back to try it. It was great! The staff did a great job. Can't wait to go back. Thank you Jersey mikes for the gluten free option."}
{"text":"Been to several locations.   I personally prefer JJ's  but enjoy the Jersey decor since that's where I'm from.  As silly as it sounds, my daughter loves cheetos so that is why we keep coming back."}
{"text":"Was waiting there ten min and not even a hello from the employees..every customer was getting thier order and I'm there just waiting.i wouldn't of minded but it wasn't busy at all. At one point two employees just standing around just look at me and go back to doing nothing. Only good thing about this place is the location cause I just left and went to smash burger. Thanks Smash Burger!!"}
{"text":"Not all JM's are the same but if you're in the area and are looking for a food option that may not have a drive through but keeps you away from the deep fryer which you can find at 80% of he other food options in the area stop by this location. Angie has the best personality and sparkling smile every time I stop in. Kealon has that positive energy and welcoming attitude you look for  each and every time.

{"text":"Lucky for me, this little gem of a sandwich shop is right next door to where I work. They keep things fresh and simple, and I appreciate that! A good value for your lunch dollar will always be found here. Really nice staff too..."}
{"text":"Just bought a giant #3 from this store. I watched the attendant make 3 sandwiches before mine was made and on each of these sandwiches, there was one pass with cheese and two passes with the meat.  When I ordered my sandwich, I ordered it with double meat, which based upon the sandwich history should have been 4 passes down the sandwich with meat.  The attendant only provided 3 passes.  I challenged her about this and was told that she did 17 cuts,  Not sure how 17 would be double the original, since is it not evenly divisible by two.  When it came time to place the onions, tomatoes and lettuce on the sandwich, the female attendant told the male attendant that they needed more onions.  He agreed with her and told her to go get some and cut them up.  Neither of these employees seems to get along with each other. They are either married to each other or brother and sister, but there is a definite conflict with them.  Not a good face to be showing to the public.  The place was filthy and will be reported to the health district.  Trash can behind register, overflowing on to the flow and almost to the register itself. The floor where the employees walk had sandwich rolls laying on the floor and they were being walked over.  Now once my sandwich was made, I was charged for double meat 3 times instead of once.   IT was the females way of letting me know I shouldn't challenge her decisions on what I eat.    When was the last time you or your store won and argument with a customer.  You can do much better than this when it comes to hiring quality employees.  Hell with charging me $26 dollars for a sandwich, you could almost hired someone who cares about your customer."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided too give Jersey Mikes's a try even know there where a few bad reviews. I ordered a regular size #13 original italian with mustard. The hero was good not the best that I have had but ok. The service was fast and friendly and the place was clean. I would probably go back and try another style sandwich. I thought the pricing was a bit high compared too a Subway."}
{"text":"Not attentive. Rude. Ordered a steak and cheese, got a chicken cheese steak. Employees didn't care nor offer to make it again. All tables were FILTHY. And apparently they are the ONLY Jersey Mike's who doesn't do a Tuesday meal special."}
{"text":"Really unimpressed.  This is essentially a more expensive version of Subway with food that doesn't taste as good.  Slow service makes the lines long and move slow.  Definitely won't be back.  I did like that they fresh cut a lot of the meat, but not enough to ever go back."}
{"text":"We I never been to this sub shop before. The giant is a giant sandwich.    The staff and the service was really good. She was very helpful on a few of the questions that I had, and very quick. My wife got the club and it was tasty she said. I got the steak and cheese. It was delicious. The only downside was it said it came with grilled onions and they were not that grilled. May be warmed up.   But for the most part was getting bullied it again. I felt like it was a little expensive for a sub."}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mikes but will never return to this location EVER, I ordered online and paid online as I have many times before on 11/22/17 I ordered and was sent a confirmation that my order would be ready at 6.30 after waiting until 7:00 I was then told that my order was now being put on. The counter person was working as fast as he could but the guy was on slow motion mode. I was tired of waiting and ask for a refund and was told they didn't have the power to do so and that I would have to take care of it myself online. Customer service is non existent at this store."}
{"text":"Let me just say I really like the subs here. Having them fixed \"Mikes way\" is the only way to get them. With that said that is the reason for the four stars but a mini sandwich is now six dollars and it's barely 4 inches. The regular is six inches and it over eight dollars. This is why I only eat here when I have a coupon. Reduce your prices already!!   Update: I'm reducing the amount of stars I previously gave to Jersey Mikes not for the taste of your sub because they really are delicious. I'm still really disappointed in your prices for what you offer. A mini #13 is almost 7 dollars? Come on. I'm not a huge fan of Subway but for the price of your mini I can get a footlong there. On this visit I couldn't help but be very disappointed in how you kept your preparation area. It was messy and not very clean. If you're not going to reduce your prices at least clean up your sandwich making area. Not sure I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"Order the chicken parm at own risk. Thankfully cooked before it gets to the location or I might have been eating an ice cube.   Not sure if this location is atypical for W. Pa, but remember them being much better both east & west of here (Philly/Columbus) in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place works for a nice sub. The staff is always so annoyed to work there though. It's not a 5 star restaurant so it's fine but seriously every time I'm there they seem annoyed that they have to make another sub."}
{"text":"Great location, friendly staff and affordable. The club supreme is my favorite here. Bacon meshes very well with the other ingredients. The bread is very tasty, too."}
{"text":"I got a regular Chicken Philly on white bread with no peppers... just chicken, cheese, and grilled onions. It was freaking delicious. I would have given 5 stars but the young man behind the counter continued making and wrapping up the sandwiches for the couple behind me after mine was sitting there ready to go. Not sure why he couldn't ring me up quickly and then finish with their sandwiches... but my sub was excellent."}
{"text":"Went to Jersey Mike's for dinner. It was freezing inside. Took several minutes for anyone to greet us. The guy who took our order mumbled so it was difficult to understand him. I asked for the regular meatball sub on white. Waited several more minutes to pay. They were moving very sloooowwwly. We went outside to eat since it was so cold in there. My boyfriend's Chicken Philly was on wheat bread even though he asked for white. The meatballs on my sandwich were big and covered in cheese, but I thought the sub roll was too bready and ended up discarding a portion of it because it was too much. I think my previous experience here was better."}
{"text":"They rip you off on Tuesdays. Any sub is supposed to be $6.49 but charge for bacon. The cashier was the old man with earrings was extremely rude."}
{"text":"With and easy to read menu, clean floor and great lunch time effenciency, why wouldn't you eat here?"}
{"text":"You can keep your Jimmy John's, and your Subway too.  Dobt even come near me with your Quiznos either.   Sandwiches here are the way sub's ought to be. Fresh sliced deli meats and cheese, great bread, and copious amounts of toppings.   I don't get here often but when I do, its a treat."}
{"text":"no complaints on the food but when someone asks for a #2 regular size, don't ask the person if they would rather try the more expensive and most popular #13. I would have ordered a #13 if I wanted a #13."}
{"text":"For a fast sandwich place this place is absolutely the best!!  Fresh, plentiful toppings (easy on the oil though)! They slice the meat fresh, super friendly service and I love the Mrs Vickies kettle chips too. My only complaint: they sometimes have stale iced tea which is just laziness or lack of a structured opening/closing plan."}
{"text":"Always love Jersey Mikes whats not too.... they literally slice the meat fresh in front of you and make the sandwich how ever you like.... we always get Mikes Way which means oil, vinegar, lettuce, tomato an onion. The ingredients are always fresh for the amount of sandwich chains out there they are your best bet. I would love to see them have an option for an apple or banana as the side in lieu of a bag of chips. Kids meal is fair priced."}
{"text":"Went there last night before they closed at nine and was told they were closed.  When I stated it was five till nine and your door was open and stated on the door you don't close till 9 I was told well we're closed.  I said so your closing early, and the reply I got was I guess so because everything is put away.  I wasted my time driving up there when they should of been open.  I will not be back for crappy service."}
{"text":"Friendly Clean Looking staff. Always my favorite sandwhich! Food is fresh, and I appreciate this location takes pride in the employees appearance. I know there are new owners, and it shows! Great work! !"}
{"text":"I love jersey mikes but coming to this location was a mistake! Their customer service is horrible and they are extremely rude! Except the one lady with darker hair who took my sub # order. The young skinny mid aged guy with a goatee was so rude! Along with the African American at the register who rang my order with a smirk on her face.  The young gentleman didn't even listen to what I wanted on my sub and kept putting oil and vinegar (loading) it onto my sandwich when I told him none on one sub and light on the other! They didn't even make another sub but all felt aggravated and annoyed for his mistake not mine..  And just gave me two cookies to make it right.. I don't want the cookie I wanted my sub to be right. I love jersey mikes!!!! But will never go to this location again!!!"}
{"text":"I just tried the Jersey Mike's in Salisbury and it makes these guys look like pikers. They should take a drive up there and see how they really should be doing things."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. My favorite sandwich place hands down. The food is 5 stars.  But the customer service is lacking. Hence the 3 stars. They weren't very friendly or happy. And they barely said more than a few words to me, not even a hello. Just stood there and stared at me, waiting for me tell them what I wanted. It was awkward to say the least.  But those are my all time favorite sandwiches...so awkward it is!  **This is for the Jersey Mike's at Ann and Simmons only tho. The others I've been to have been wonderful."}
{"text":"I love the different sizes in subs. I would go here instead of Subway for fresh, tasty and delicious subs."}
{"text":"I have always gone to this location for Jersey Mike's and I have never been disappointed until this evening. I ordered a #56- Big Kahuna and cheese, the gentleman microwaved my bread and then once the steak and cheese was done he put it on the bread, and then he let it sit for three minutes while he was waiting for someone else's order to be done. A  young lady finally came out of the back and I asked her how long he was going to let my sandwich sit there before he dressed it. By the time I got home the bread was getting hard and the steak and cheese was cold so I'm not sure if I will go back to this location or if I will never order the #56 Big Kahuna."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's makes a very solid hot Italian sub. It's a classic sub with the usual meats, shredded lettuce, tomato, and the critical sliced white onions. I got my sub Mike's way, which includes, oil & vinegar, and seasonings. It was a very tasty sub with fresh bread.  I'll eventually make my way around their menu, but their are so many sandwich shops around that this task could take the better part of a decade.  Keep it up, Jersey Mike's!"}
{"text":"Service is pretty quick and workers are friendly.  They slice their meats and cheeses as they are making your sandwich.  I like the Turkey and Provolone and the bread is always fresh.  Make sure to sign up for their emails.  You will get a coupon for a free sub and drink on your birthday!"}
{"text":"Never again will I come to this location. Based on my previous experiences with Jersey Mike's I probably wouldn't have anyway if not for a friend wanting to go because our purchase was \"supposed to be\" donated to a good cause.  Right at the top of my list is I find their sandwiches boring and bland and in the bottom anchor position compared to any of the other sub shops I go to.  But they're tolerable and I usually drop in at the other Jersey Mike's up the street maybe once a year.  As far as value, once again Jersey Mike's comes in absolute dead last. No matter where I go for a sub, including some of the incredibly good mom and pop sandwich shops around Phoenix, Jersey Mike's qualifies as a ripoff - $8.80 for a small simple Italian sub?  In what universe?  Now the reason why I scratched this particular location off my list forever is abysmally bad service. There were literally two people there besides us late one afternoon, not exactly a lunch hour rush but for some reason they had 8-10 people scurrying around trying to look busy.  Too busy to acknowledge that we were waiting to place an order. And waiting. And waiting.  Finally a person who clearly should not have a people-facing job yelled at me for my order and AS I WAS TELLING HER she turned her back, yelled something into the kitchen, and turned on the meat slicer 10' away and never looked at me. She repeated \"my order\" and no surprise, she had it wrong.  I repeated it, trying to yell over the sound of the meat slicing machine and she copped the biggest attitude and (no lie) she said \"Well I couldn't hear you!!!\"  Seriously!  No s*** Suzy, of course you couldn't hear me, you weren't listening!  BTW, is it any surprise that so many of the other negative reviews say the same thing ... bad attitude?  When my (tiny) sandwich was ready to have the toppings put on it the girl at that station asked if I wanted it Mike's Way.  Of course I had told girl #1 that I wanted it Mike's Way but she was too busy putting on a pity party for herself about how stressed and tired and busy she was with, OMG, 4 customers in the entire restaurant.  I didn't check to find out if she committed Hari Kari the next day when the customer count rose to a whole 8 people.  And you know what the sad thing is?  I would make the comment at this point that this place is in serious need of a front line manager but you know what?  I'm afraid that Pity Patty IS the manager. Yikes!"}
{"text":"I've been to the original east-coast Mike's.  As expected this franchise conglomerate is in no way similar to the original eastern states subs.  For all their hype they are what we all know they are ... a fast food chain not unlike McDonalds, Burger King, Wendy's and the others.   What COULD save them is if they served a product that's a cut above and superior service (after all they only run on 2 -3 staff members per shift, unlike some chains that require 20 - 30).  But sadly, no.  Whereas, with such a small staff I would expect to repeatedly see the same guys (oh, yeah, I have never seen a girl work at Jersey Mike's) each time I visit, which is pretty often, nope, it is new guys each and every time.  Is it that bad of a place to work? (I finally figured out that NO ONE could work for the store manager for more than one shift).  This is just processed cold cuts, bread and some cheap condiments, what could make a Jersey Mike's sandwich so ridiculously expensive?  They have low overhead, a tiny staff and minimal ingredients, why do they charge as much as they do?  There is a certain logic that says if you offer an awesome product and charge through the snout, you will make a lot of money.  That's basic capitalism.  Nice theory, but I have NEVER been to this Jersey Mike's location when I had more than 2 people in front of me and more than 5 people total in the entire restaurant.  This is good business sense to have an empty restaurant?  I looked at my experience recently.  The place was nearly deserted.  When I walked in the first counter person tried to force me to choose a sandwich I had no desire to buy.  I knew what I wanted before I walked in.  What could have / should have been a friendly, relaxed opportunity to give some good customer service came across more as a don't care attitude.  When I declined to order what he wanted he got pretty grouchy and slammed his way into the kitchen.  The sandwich was adequate.  Period.  Too little ingredients, one end way too soaked with oil & vinegar, and worth about $1.99 at Subway.  But holy cow, it was SEVEN BUCKS!!!!!  Just for the sandwich!!!!  Since I first wrote this review I accidentally discovered a very new, much smaller chain called Which Wich.  Wow, what a difference.  The whole experience is better, and the staff seems like they really like their jobs and care about their customers.  But what really counts is the food.  They run circles around every other sub place in the incredible variety of choices they offer, and their \"regular\" sub is substantially larger and meatier than Mike's, fresher, and a lower price.  And, oh yeah, they let me customize my sandwich MY way, not the way some guy named Mike says I should.  [EDIT 1) Sorry folks to go on about this. I just dropped my 2-star rating to 1-star. I would have gone 0-star if I could. I recently went back (against my better judgement) because Mike's corporate was showing support for the east coast tragedies.  MISTAKE!  The store manager (franchise owner?) was so rude I think some of his staff quit on the spot. I can clearly see why no women work for him. The few customers got up and almost ran out of the store.  Swore I would never come back.  [EDIT 2] I am such a wimp.  I did come back recently because of some freebie coupons.  Once again, the store was empty (at prime eating time). Once again all new faces and no female workers.  Once again the unbelieveably rude manager was hitting on some (um, VERY young) chicks.  The sandwich maker was an angry disinterested mess ... never asked me what I wanted in or on the sandwich, just robotically slapped some stuff on a bun.  Store manager in pissy mood (again).  This franchisee just doesn't give a sh*t and NO WAY deserves to be in business (and the zero lack of customers proves the point). AVOID LIKE A CASE OF REALLY BAD STD!!  [EDIT 3] I haven't been back to a Jersey Mike's in a long time. Went to one because I got a freebie coupon and WOW ... the price for a regular sandwich (sandwich only) is $7.50 and a large is $12.45.  Are they freakin' out of their minds!?!?!?  Or I could get the same large size at Subway for $5.00.  They didn't know they were making a freebie until it got to the cashier so I can assume that the tiny amount of meat I got was \"Mike's way\" of charging more and serving less.  The service was just as bad but, woohoo, they finally hired a female."}
{"text":"I don't know how good this Jersey Mikes is because it did not close at 10am as started on Yelp. It closed at 9pm....off to smash burger"}
{"text":"I was here when it first opened and continue to go- yes, they were slow when they were learning. They are great now. Super nice. They did make a mistake by not firing our first sub when we went once, but were apologetic and comped our next sandwich to make up for it. For those that are knocking the amount of vinegar and oil- you watched them make the sandwich? You can tell them to stop. For a chain sandwich shop, we love this place. Plus, you can earn free subs and they have coupons all the time."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is all about.   I got the cheesesteak with chipotle sauce; she got the Italian \"sub in a tub.\"  Her sub in a tub was literally all the ingredients of a sub, in a plastic container, no bread. Does that bother me? No. So why am I making a big deal about it? Because its nothing special. We had it prepared \"Mike's way,\" which meant it was sprinkled with petrified, flavorless oregano flakes, and dressed with oil and red wine vinegar. Mehh.   The real train wreck was the cheesesteak with chipotle sauce that I ordered. The chipotle sauce was basically some form of heavy, gooey dressing, which sat in my stomach like a rock. For four hours. I felt nauseous the whole time. I have no idea how a cheesesteak with provolone cheese could have possibly turned out like this.   And yes, I spent many years in NJ, so I know a thing or two about good subs.   Not a fan. Sorry."}
{"text":"Having gone to this place many times over the years, I will never return! Not only did I walk out in the middle of my order but so did the couple in front of me and my son. The two people behind the counter were incredibly rude, both acting like we were an inconvenience when trying to tell them what we did and did not want on the sandwich, rudely asking \"ANYTHING ELSE???\" the girl wouldn't even let me finish my sentence before interrupting me. It saddens me the lack of customer service this place displayed! It seems to be the norm these days!"}
{"text":"It's probably better than 3 stars but they need to earn another star. The line is out the door for lunch so I guess people are happy with their product. I love hot sandwiches so I'll try a few before I totally decide."}
{"text":"When I moved into a new apartment in Tempe, Jersey Mikes provided me with a coupon for a free sub. I was a huge fan of Mr. Goodcents and Blimpie and was fairly loyal to both franchises when I wanted a sub, but since I had a free coupon to Jersey Mikes, I decided to check them out. I'm glad I did. Jersey Mikes may now be my new favorite place to get a sub. I recommend the Italian on Wheat and definitely go \"Mikes Way\" on the sub."}
{"text":"I have dined at some really good Jersey Mike locations and some really bad ones.  This one was average.  The guys were really nice and even came around and checked on my grandmother and me.  A huge strike against them is that they had no blinds for any of their windows and we had to move tables because the sun shining in was unbearable.  Tables were clean."}
{"text":"Sebastian helped me out so much today. Very helpful and made great conversation while i waited for my order. However I could not believe how rude Gabe was. Ridiculous how he could talk to a supervisor like that and get away with that. I am a chef for four peaks brewing company and would def not tolerate the insubordination that Gabe showed in front of customers. It is def unnacceptable. Thank you to Sebastian for keeping composure in front of me and another customer. 5 stars to him"}
{"text":"Very clean. Had an extensive menu. Just not what I wanted. Back east they have chicken salad on the menu. Now they are just another sub place. Like all the others. Brand new location. Very nice inside. Best of luck to them."}
{"text":"What is with this dumb trend of mid-grade Subway ripoffs? Every other store is a cold cut place that does literally nothing interesting. This is a pile of meat and sadness. I went here once because my friends insisted and I hope to never return."}
{"text":"My brother introduced me to Jersey Mike's in San Diego and I finally decided to try it out near my house!  I liked that the staff greeted me as I entered the store as if I have been coming for a long time!  I needed sandwiches for a committee meeting and Nathan took my list and had everyone's sandwich labeled (for easy distribution)!  Jersey Mike's has become my NEW favorite sandwich shop! Every sandwich is make fresh and has a ton of meat!!   Thanks Nathan!  You are my new friend!  If you stop by, please tell him you read Jo's review on YELP."}
{"text":"The employees on several occasions have done multiple tasks with the same gloves on while touching the food.  I am talking about writing down the orders with pens, then touching the bread, meat and cheese, go to the back and grab supplies, touch the food again, grab a dirty rag, then walk down and ring up the meal, then go back and do it all over again with the next customer.  No new gloves.  If the health department came in and did a surprise visit witnessing this, it wouldn't go well for the owners.  Just saying..."}
{"text":"Pretty shocked at how good this was.  Compared to other sandwich places, from Subway to Dibella to Jimmy John's, this is a clear step up. Bread is the huge winner here - their original dressing is top notch.  They make the sandwich good again.  That's just my attempt at a new slogan, you're welcome."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  There was a little attitude with the service.  Floor behind the counter could use some work, but not sure it was any different then the rest of the places around here.  Food was a 4 star;  the rest brings it to a 3."}
{"text":"Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.  Everything is always fresh and delicious.  I always get the club sub it's one of my favorites.  If you're a student just get the student deal it includes chips and drink."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich store on campus. I tried two different sandwiches here on two different occasions and both times, the sandwiches SUCKED. The bread is too dry and tastes worse than storebought bread. The sandwiches are drowsed in olive oil/vinegar and do not taste very good."}
{"text":"Went there today because I'm trying to check out the eateries in my new neighborhood and it's hard to find a good sub. Ordered the giant club sub. Unfortunately I was running errands and it ended up sitting in the back seat of my car for well over an hour. Still, it was a great sub. Good bread, fresh meat that isn't slimy and questionable like at some places and lots of ingredients. I can't wait to try some of the other sandwiches on the menu.  Update: Also have tried the meatball sub and Philly cheese steak, both were excellent."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Jersey Mike's and have been to many locations over the years and this one was pretty bad. I ordered a meatball sub, which I've had at other locations, and it was nearly inedible. I ended up tossing it after a couple bites because the meatballs were cold and dry (almost no sauce at all), the cheese was cold and the bread was hard enough to beat a bear to death with. It was pretty busy when I got there so I'm not sure why the bread was already getting hard. The only positive was all the people working there were nice."}
{"text":"Yum! A sandwich is always my top choice for a quick and easy lunch and Jersey Mike's doesn't disappoint. Their subs are simple and delicious. The service is really good. When we told them it was our first time in they gave us free cookies. I don't argue with free food. The store is spotless and even the slicer seemed shiny and clean. I'll be back often!"}
{"text":"Three couples went there last night before going to listen to the music at Stonecrest. We were there first and the girl behind the counter made it seem like we were bothering her. We had trouble hearing her because she was mumbling. We had a coupon for a regular sub, chips and a drink for $6.99. We ordered one regular sup and a second regular roast beef sub. We asked to use a second coupon just for a second bag of chips. They said fine.  When we went to pay the person at the register, it took three tries for their system to process my wife's credit card. She was losing her patience's so when it finally processed, she never bothered to check the printed receipt. Later on while talking with the other couples who came in later, we checked the receipt and found we were charged $20 and change. So the second regular sub was $13.00.!!! Well beside the unfriendly service and the overcharge, needless to say we will not be going back. The Jersey Mike's in Indian Land is top notch and puts this location to shame. The other couple were also overcharged and the other said they had a tough time hearing what the girl behind the counter was saying."}
{"text":"Just popped for the first time. All my friends have been talking about the #13 sandwich here, the original Italian. But they all say get it \"Andrea style\". They add a bit of mayo to the bread and then toast it. It was an amazing slice of golden brown and delicious on the sandwich. I expect jersey mikes across the country will start adding this as an option soon. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Since I saw this place had good reviews I drove out of my way to get two sandwiches. The guy was talking and talking the whole time with other employees while he was making my sandwiches. I think that's really disgusting. I don't want his saliva all over on my sandwich. And to make it worse, one of my sandwiches were California Sub and I ordered it with wheat bread but since he was so disrupted talking, he made my sandwich with white bread by mistake. He couldn't make a new one because he used the last portion of guacamole. He was not even apologetic. This would be my first and last time coming here. I could not even enjoy my sandwich because the service was so bad."}
{"text":"Ordered a regular thinking that it was a 12\" sub. It wasn't. It was a 6\". Does that make a mini sub a 3\"?? I asked for no onion, no oil or vinegar or seasoning Only mayo. They sent it to me without lettuce and tomato also. Worst $10 sandwich I ever ate. Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This place is just an over priced subway. 25.00 for two subs and drinks! Ahhh! GET REAL!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Jersey, my name is Mike. I used to get these subs all the time at the shore. Can't wait to stop in!!"}
{"text":"Like always, Jersey Mike's always hits the ball out of the park! I could never do Subway again after enjoying their sandwiches. They slice the meats fresh right on site and cook whatever needs to be cooked right there. Nothing is sitting in preservatives all day long like at other sandwich shops. I ventured to this location on my birthday to enjoy a free birthday sub and drink. Extremely friendly staff! They seem to be very proud that they worked there. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Good quality food at an ok price. I don't come here too often simply because of the price but when I'm ready to spoil myself I come here. Love their bread and quality of food"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, right in the middle of the lunch rush. The line was wrapped around the store, and yet it wasn't more than five minutes before I was able to order, and was out the door within six. This store is also much cleaner than the Mentor location."}
{"text":"Been to Jersey Mikes in NW which are awesome,so went to this one in Vegas. Mistake, staff cares less, kinda rude actually. Manager or owner must not care. Did not even have regular chips, his answer? Time to switch to barbecue chips and yells this across the store.  Guess manager cant plan his inventory . Bacon is in pile near register, not even covered and attendant sneezes right next to it! Avoid this JM the owners must not care with so many bad reviews"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT Subs, and great staff.  The #13 Italian is a great sandwich with REAL meat and REAL cheese.  After you've tried this place, you wont waste your money at that other sub chain again.  The staff have clean, neat uniforms and a friendly attitude.  You can't beat Jersey Mike's, especially this location !!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here yesterday- the girl at the counter walked us through all of the options and made great suggestions. The sandwiches were delicious! Sad the Quiznos closed in this location but the customer service here couldn't be beat:) We will be back."}
{"text":"J.M.s has an authentic sub flavor.  I've gotten all my subs Mike's way #5, #8 and #13 - will not dissapoint.  Fresh cut - standard for a good sub shop.  Service is fair and the place is pretty clean.  Basic armosphere, tv with sports on and they play upbeat oldies music."}
{"text":"Airport food is usually mediocre and overpriced. They have excellent subs here with lots of real roast beef and fresh toppings. This place is definitely worth checking out if you're hungry in the airport."}
{"text":"Love Jersey Mikes subs! Always get the turkey Mikes way! This location in particular has very friendly staff which is very refreshing to see such great customer services!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's never disappoints. Definitely one of the best sandwich chains. They slice their deli meats to order which is pretty cool; not an experience you would get at many other sub shops.  The fresh ingredients and friendly service keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Good turkey sub on wheat  but very  pricey. Will not return for 9.00 bucks  I expect chips and a drink. I feel it's a rip off for a 8\" inch sub. I'll stick with subway or blimpies.."}
{"text":"Solid jersey mikes location. I've never had any issues when coming to or ordering from this location. My order has always been correct and I've never encountered rude employees.   I would definitely pick Jersey Mike's over other comparable chains based on taste and flavor. You pay a couple of dollars more here but I think it's worth it for what you receive. Regulars always fill me up, I need to remember to order minis if I'm not totally starving.   This is a place to stop for a quick meal. It's nothing fancy but tasty."}
{"text":"This place is consistent and beats subway and some other fast sandwich chains around. It's nothing gourmet by again with places like this, reliability is key!  First time at this specific location and it matches what I expect from jersey mikes. Most of the employees are friendly and they were super quick to get our sandwiches made today. Interior was pretty clean and was pretty chill for a Saturday around lunch time. The building is surrounded by office space so I can imagine they do great business during the week.   I always get the #8, mikes way, and it's never failed me. Even a mini can fill me up if I'm not starving. Great portions!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this afternoon for a number 13. Tyler helped me make a choice and it came out really nice. Super helpful and overall a good sub. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I decided to do the bounce back to Jersey Mikes as I was swamped with work and needed something I could eat at my desk.  The bounce back allows you to bring back your receipt from Tuesday and get the sandwich, chips, and drink special for $5.99.  I went on a Friday afternoon around 11:30 am.  There were few people inside and only one person ahead of me in line.  I ordered the same thing I previously had on Tuesday, the original Italian.  The sandwich had the same high quality and everything from my previous review was reinforced.  Since it was pretty slow I was able to interact with the staff there. They were extremely friendly and courteous.  The woman garnishing sandwiches called me \"sweetie\" (don't tell my wife).  The manager was on the register and he asked me if I liked the bounce back deal.  I replied with a hearty, \"yes I do!\"  He stated that he was glad to hear that.  I'd like to think I can tell if someone is just going through the motions or really enjoys interacting with their customers.  At this location the staff were the later.  Because of the great sandwiches and awesome staff I have to bump my rating up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is always dependable good food. This location also features especially friendly people and a sparkling clean restaurant. The owners are approachable and do everything possible to accommodate their patrons. Best hero's since we left Jersey!"}
{"text":"I typically like JM's but this location is exception to the rule. Same ingredients, decent bread, pressed generic deli meat, really good hot pepper relish...but the staff struggles to be efficient when they are busy."}
{"text":"Their cold subs are okay. But the cheesesteaks and chicken cheesesteaks (after being modified) taste very similar to the sandwiches from PA, much more than most \"philly cheesesteaks\" you get in this state. A little pricey but good."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood! Great to have you here. Great old fashion roast beef is my fav!"}
{"text":"I've been eating subs for many, many years, I'm 67. When I first ordered here, I didn't know anything about their food, so I ordered a #13, original Italian, because that's my benchmark of a sub shop. My favorite sub in Chicago is Fontano's, a little grocery place near UIC campus. The JM sub ties Fontano's for excellence in a sandwich. Subway, Jimmy John's and Quizno's shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath with JM's. The only problem is that the Champaign store is on campus, and right now there are very few places to park. But it's well worth walking a few blocks."}
{"text":"I had the Club Sub, my husband had the Roast Beef Sub.  Both were delicious, a large amount of meat, just the right amount of toppings.  The vinegarette and olive oil they drizzle on the sub is delicious.  The only negative was the bread is a bit hard. I myself prefer softer bread."}
{"text":"Stopped here along the way home. Woo, road trips! Great customer service and great subs! I'd recommend this place to others"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Jersey Mike's I've ever been to in terms of customer service and cleanliness. The manager, always has crazy hairstyles, is by far the hardest working and fastest person who's there and on top of that she's very friendly and knows me and calls me by name everytime I'm there.  Great service and good subs. The only area I know they need help in is with their phone orders. My assistant placed one the other day and the guy screwed both sandwiches up so a little more attention to detail is needed on that front."}
{"text":"We like the subs and the people are always friendly. However, they are probably the most disorganized bunch of sub makers I've ever seen. Called in an order the other day and I get there... Oops, sorry we forgot to make your sub. Even ordering in person can be rather frustrating at times due to how confused their sandwich makers get when faced with a decent lunch crowd coming in. Today we ordered over the phone for pick up and they again forgot to put the bacon on it, get your shit together! Once they get their issues resolved and get more on the ball I can definitely see giving them another star but for now they're just making a 3 in my book."}
{"text":"I came here because subways closes at 7 now in steelecroft. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and welcomed. I informed them I've never been here and asked for suggestions. I told him my intention was subways meatball sub, he suggested their meatball sub but did say that it is not very filling. I appreciated that information. He said honestly the Italian is awesome the way I make it. He said someone put him on to it and he's been hooked since. I agreed to try it. He fixed it and let me decide the toppings. He also included the chipotle ranch. When I say this sub was delicious. I kid you not. This sub was delicious. In fact, I don't want to jump to quickly but this may be my favorite new (to me) sub. The Italian sub is so filling, I didn't even eat my side of chips which I find as a staple in a meal. I can't have a sub without chips but did this time. There were two people working, from whom I saw, the one making my sandwich and girl. Both were so friendly. I definitely recommend this jersey mikes and definitely the Italian sub. Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Forget about other sub shops - Jersey Mike's is the BEST! They cut the meat and cheese fresh when you order your sub - everything is fresh and delicious every single time I go to Jersey Mike's! I read other reviews about it being expensive - here's the deal - you get what you pay for. Jersey Mike's has quality food and excellent service - well worth paying a little extra for! Tip: Get your sub and then let it sit in the fridge for a few hours - the flavors melt together and become even more amazing :)"}
{"text":"Tried out this new location by our house and we were disappointed. My husband said when they were making the sandwich they went very slow and even the person ringing us out went super slow. We asked for mustard and there was none. We asked for mikes way and we found our sandwich soggy from the amount of oil and vinegar they put on. So dissatisfied and disappointed in this experience."}
{"text":"Great service and subs. One of my favorite places to get deli sandwiches. They also have cheese steaks that are pretty good. Go mikes way on the subs!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is delicious.   That being said, a request for the staff: When someone orders something that is obviously a pain to make, or involves something extra, don't make comments about how much food it is OUT LOUD, and \"how on earth could someone eat this much food?\". Ever stop to think that the sandwich will last me a few days? Sheesh."}
{"text":"Amaze balls!  Been here a handful of times, and am always impressed. Just had an issue one time - they took a while and they didn't follow order directions, but the quality of the food was still great.   Bread is always fresh, they carve and grill the meat for their subs in house. They are WAY better than subway and Jimmy Johns.   They also have delicious brownies and cookies.   Go give them a try! I hope they open more locations soon."}
{"text":"Tried this sub shop for the first time today..very good sub..the\"mini\" is actually quite big i thought..i had the provolone ham and salami sandwhich on wheat served \"mikes way\" with some added toppings as well..very reasonable priced too which i was pleased with..staff were accomodating and restaurant was very clean! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Fast service considering this is in a busy business area! I typically try to beat the crowds around 11am. The sandwiches are awesome! Love the Italian style sandwich. Pricey, but you get what you pay for!  Right off the 202 in the new Rivulon area."}
{"text":"Been here several times and every time the sandwiches gets worse. The final straw was last night we stopped in for some subs. We ordered 3 sandwiches and was told we could get one free due to purchasing so many subs over time. The guy billed us out for 4 subs instead of 3 and getting one of those discounted off.  When we caught it, while sitting in the store eating we brought it to their attention.  We were told there was nothing they could do. They can overcharge us but can't refund us??? The Manager hid in the back room until I  specifically asked to speak to her. Even she passed the buck and said we would have to speak with the GM to get our only back. Nothing she could do because the system is computerized is what she said.  I would NOT recommend this place to my worst enemy.  VERY POOR SERVICE!!!!"}
{"text":"The guys here are so nice. Super fast with your order. They will customize it for you. It's not gourmet food but it's pretty much what you would expect from a sandwich shop. I got the chicken philly and was pleased."}
{"text":"The 5 stars are really for the customer service at this location. The guys working in the afternoons are always very friendly and welcoming. We have gone a few times because of them. The sandwiches are good but the employees definitely make it worth the visit."}
{"text":"Bread to meat ratio is super off. To get even close to the right amount of meat for the amount of bread they have you have to pay for extra meat so it becomes quite pricey. Bread isn't very good meat is good. Would rather go to subway honestly. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Italian in phoenix, and great deals on catering.first time customers get a free cookie and everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"honestly one of the better subs ive ever had in general. great staff, good subs, amazing tuna sub. always happy here."}
{"text":"First off, the bread is damn good. Yum. Seriously. Now, I bet the meaty subs are all so very great- my boyfriend says so, which is why he comes here, and took me here to try it. I got the Veggie sub. Sans veggies...apparently. It comes with a mountain of cheese- which is good, I love cheese, but the 'veggie' part is tomato, lettuce, peppers, and onions. That's it. That's all. A cheese and lettuce sub is really what it is, since the rest they are very stingy on. They have a veggie wrap that has mushrooms in it. Why can't they put those on the sub?! The lady we got mumbled, horribly, to the point where I had to keep asking \"What?\" and get a look from her. In the words of Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka...\"MUMBLER!\" The quality is really good, the bread, cheese, everything is very fresh tasting, but I do not like that their Veggie sub is laking in veggies."}
{"text":"The ingredients here are really good, unfortunately the employees are incapable of following directions. Tried to go 3 times over a 3 week period and my order was made wrong every time, both in person and via online orders.   Will not go back at this point."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this review isn't on the service. I was helped by two nice young men. The food however was extremely disappointing. My husband and I are new to the area, and are huge Jersey Mike's fans. We've been to a lot of different locations and each one weighs the meat they put on our sandwiches. The sandwiches we've always had are loaded and we leave satisfied. Well, the sandwiches we got at this location we're so small. We both got regulars and they barely had any meat on them. The meat was not weighed. We felt as if it had less meat than a subway sandwich, which says a lot, especially when our total for 2 regular subs and 2 fountain drinks was $21. We did not get $21 worth of food. The location is convenient, but I don't think will be back."}
{"text":"Great tasting food but they need better service at this in-particular location. I ordered my food online and was given the wait time of a half hour. I went in to pick up my food but they had not even begun on the order yet.  Now I would not mind this if they were super super busy and had a rush of people to where they couldn't get to the order right away.  However, there was not a single customer in the establishment besides myself.  I continued to sit and wait 15 minutes for them to make my order.  Again, fantastic food! Just very unfortunate customer service."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good if you're here at the right time to avoid stale bread or just the moment it's becoming rock hard. Also if I'm being asked to dine in....then I want a tray or basket. Beware most times they end up dousing the oil and/or vinegar like someone wearing bad cologne. If you can perceiver those hurdles, then you'll have a great sandwich. These folks are always kind and restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"The customer service improved dramatically from my last visit. The crew members were much nicer, polite and friendly.  I had a much better experience on this visit. The food was very tasty. I had a philly cheese steak sandwich. I really enjoyed the way it was prepared with a few onions, red and green bell peppers.  I believe I would visit here again if I come to the area again."}
{"text":"Loved their Philly Cheese steak. Definitely one of the more legit ones I've had. Took a little while to get my sub, but they are grilling it fresh in front of you, so I can be patient. Comparable to Philly's Best. YUM"}
{"text":"My family loves Jersey Mike's but this particular locations staff is just unfriendly. They are not friendly to each other or to the patrons. I always feel like I'm intruding or bothering them just to pick up my order. I'll continue to have Jersey Mike's at other locations."}
{"text":"Today I decided to try this place for the first time and I can honestly say it's the last time I walk in to this establishment. I walked in and the place was dead, 2 employees were present, 1 on the phone and the second one was stocking the chips. I was not greeted or acknowledged...I proceeded to stand under the order here sign and waited for approximately 3 minutes without any welcome or we will be right with you! I walked out after waiting and it was as if I were not even there! Worst customer service experience ever.  It would've been my first time but now I will never support Jersey Mikes."}
{"text":"This location is great, best sub I've had yet. My roommate told me before how friendly the staff was. Not sure if it was the same guy, but very courteous and friendly. It's rare nowadays (in PHX at least) for restaurant employees to care enough to ask you how your day's been and make small talk with people. That always gets a tip out of me! Food is excellent and their roast beef is pink instead of nasty brown. I love that! I would love it even more if they would call it 'roast beast' (Grinch anyone?). Also, their bread is of the crusty variety, not soft like Subway. Sometimes I wonder if other reviewers think it's stale as they're basically comparing apples to oranges there. I didn't really pay attention to the prices because I had a coupon, but they send coupons in the mail all the time, so people should keep a lookout for those. Even though you can get a bigger sub elsewhere for cheaper, these subs are heartier and therefore way more filling. I can eat a footlong sub at Subway with little effort, a regular sub from Jersey Mike's, not as easy! That's a good thing!"}
{"text":"We didn't want to cook because it was hot(that's like everyday during the summer ahaha). We drove by and never noticed this place. Boy we have been missing good food.  The location is not super big but clean and cool. The prices are like any sandwich shop. The food is good! I had the #9 Club Supreme-Turkey, ham, provolone, bacon, mayo - and of course had it  Mike's Way!- with their olive oil and other sauce with veggies added. It was tasty and fresh.  I give it 3 stars for fresh and good food. Tip is get the giant and it can last small appetites 3 meals and big appetites 1 to 2 meals."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is OK, I guess. It gets constant hype here in Las Vegas, and they definitely have some good sandwiches.  But I'm from Jersey. And when I think of a submarine sandwich, I don't think of turkey and stuffing, or pastrami and cole slaw.  Ask me to imagine a sub and I'll close my eyes and picture a Jersey Mike's #13.  I've said it before and I'll say it again - a great sandwich starts with great bread, in this case a soft, crusty roll dusted with a ton of cornmeal.  Meats and cheeses are sliced to order, cut thin and piled high. In the case of the #13, we're talking about ham, prosciuttini, cappacuolo, salami, pepperoni and provolone.  There aren't a ton of veggie choices, \"Mike's Way\" is the traditional lettuce, tomato, onion, spices and oil and vinegar, aka \"the juice.\" This is definitely a place where sticking to tradition pays off.  That's it - no gimmicky sauces, no toasters. Just a great, authentic Jersey Shore style sandwich.  Their cheesesteaks are also pretty fantastic, a much more moist and well-blended steak and cheese mix than Cap's steaks. It's not a POP'S whiz wit, but it doesn't claim to be.  The sandwiches are fairly expensive but so, so, so good - and I get coupons in my inbox and mailbox every month. And besides, for a taste of home like this? Well worth it."}
{"text":"#56, the loaded Philly cheese = yum!  Good quality ingredients. Reasonable portion for the price.  Place is clean, people are nice.  I'm not a fan of this kind of place having an actual - or a virtual (CC machine) \"tip jar.\" I suppose I get it if I'm placing a large order for a lot of people all at once. But, if it's just me or 2 of us, sorry - that isn't worth a tip for the assembly-line process at this kind of place.  Other than that, I like Jersey Mike's the best for all the sub sandwich places."}
{"text":"Going to miss you guys from Uptown. Most reasonably priced fair in the area that is also tasty.  Fair pricing. Good quality meats. Usually - not always - well portioned. Decent bread though it can get soggy from all the juicy add-ons.  Almost always very friendly people. Not usually very fast.   Nice Yelp offer: free cookie with check-in. In truth, your cookies are pretty small for the regular price."}
{"text":"I'm not the hugest fan of Jersey Mikes (My wife is though!), but whenever I eat one, it is never bad, and actually tastes pretty good for a chain type sub shop.  I was undecided on what to get for lunch today, but then I checked my Facebook page, and saw that today, March 30th, Jersey Mikes was donating all their proceeds to local charities (Phoenix Childrens Hospital)!  We had/have so much love for Children's Hospitals (Radys in San Diego, mostly!), I knew that I would have to come down and get lunch.  I went with a regular #13 (Italian Sub), chips (Doritos) and a drink (Wild Cherry Pepsi).  My total was just over $11.00.  The sandwich was tasty!  I had them hook it up with extra oil and vinegar.  The bread was soft, the meats were plentiful, and I loved the extra oil and vinegar.  It made the bread really soft and provided great flavor!  It definitely hit the spot!  Doritos are always good, and the drink was alright (Coke fan, here).    Service was friendly and I enjoyed my lunch.  Super awesome that all of todays proceeds are going to a great cause, too!  I hope they do this every year!  As long as they do, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife loves Jersey Mikes!  While she was pregnant, she couldn't eat any lunch meats (possibility of listeria).  Once she had our daughter, this was one of her first requests.  I hadn't had Jersey Mikes in awhile, so I was down, too!  We always get coupons in the mail so I decided to use one the other night.  You get 2 regular subs, 2 chips, and 2 drinks for $14.99.  Not bad!  I drove down and went inside.  I went with a #13, Italian sub and my wife went with a #8, the Club sub.  Went with some Ms Vickes salt and vinegar chips and a wild cherry Pepsi to drink.   Our sandwiches were good!  I like how they slice the meat when you order it, and when you get it topped \"Mikes Way\" it comes with oil and vinegar, lettuce, tomato and onion.  I added some of their hot pepper relish onto my sub, too.  It was a pretty solid sandwich!  We actually went here twice in 3 days!  Jersey Mikes sandwiches always get about a 3/3.5 star rating from me.  They are good, but they are never \"great\".  What WAS great though, was the customer service here.  There was a lady working (never got her name unfortunately) both Wednesday and Friday when I stopped in.  I had on my bracelet from the hospital and she asked me if I had a baby recently.  We started talking about kids and hospitals and all sorts of stuff. She was extremely friendly, personable and she also made a damn good sandwich!  When I came back in on Friday, she recognized me right away and asked how the baby was doing etc.  Great, great customer service!  Even though Jersey Mikes isn't my favorite, I would come back in just because of her.   As long as my wife loves and requests to eat at Jersey Mikes, I will continue to eat here.  With their coupons, prices aren't too bad, and I can think of much worse sandwiches you can get from other spots in town. Jersey Mikes is A-OK by me!"}
{"text":"Food is always pretty good. When I order I always get all of my veggies on the side so that my sandwich won't get soggy on the way home. The price is as expected for a sub shop I suppose. The restaurant is always clean. Whenever I go it's al wyd hit or miss as to if it's crowed or not.  I have been times and they are crowed and others not so much. The same with the staff, it's hit or miss, as to if you will get someone nice, not nice or in between. All in all not to bad so I will be back. Wish they delivered like Jimmy Johns because I would rather have Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Okay, so it's a \"chain restaurant,\" but you'd never know it by the quality sandwiches and welcoming staff.   I always love walking in the door and being greeted by a laughing, singing, and altogether boisterously friendly crew.   The quality of the sandwiches is above any other \"chain\" sub shop. All the meat and cheese is freshly cut when you order, the bread is always great, and the veggies are above par (i.e. no wilted tomatoes etc.).   Subway fans... Fear Mike!"}
{"text":"Been to quite a few different Jersey Mikes locations and this one is by far the best! The guys working here tonight were fast, friendly and efficient. They LOADED our sandwiches to the max which was nice! Pricey but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Arizona where the service isn't nearly as friendly as their Californian sister and there are roaches crawling on the glass. We pointed out the roach and staff didn't seem too concerned. Leisurely finished what they were doing and then fetched it off the glass. Sandwich is okay but unappealing after this visit."}
{"text":"They have sweet peppers. I LOVE SWEET PEPPERS! Try them on your cheesesteak. I like them on my cold italian sub. Yum."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the chain but I am really tired of this location getting my order wrong. I ask for mayo. NO mayo. I ask for sweet peppers, I get hot. I ask for it to not be Mike's way and it turns out Mike's way. Going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went in with buy 2 get 1 free. Purchased 3 giants 1 regular 1 mini asked if the giant would be free.  Told yes it's the only one you bought 3 of.The roast beef was at the end of the cut just a few shreds counted as a slice. Of course they took $5 mini of instead of the $13 giant. Picking up food for me and roommates would have done two transactions if I'd known.Ask to change it told needed a manager key he didn't have one.The name says Courtney it was a guy. Not going back felt ripped off.Still tipped $5 way to lose a good customer."}
{"text":"Have not been in a long time, BF is in LOVE w/Jersey Mike's, he recently ate there and SWORE it was better than every.. same ole Jersey Mike's... the staff was really nice/helpful, just not a big fan. Either you love JMs or you dont. I am on the fence."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today, and all I can say is this place is really good. The staff there was amazing and so friendly. The service was so fast and prompt I will definitely be going back great job guys"}
{"text":"good sandwiches for a good price!  also take apple pay!!"}
{"text":"I just had my second sub from Jersey mikes o my reminds me of home back east the bread is just awesome. The staff is great the service is great the food is great what more can you ask for. I will be a regular customer for sure."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a chicken cheese steak. I'm not big on sandwiches but every now and then I crave a good sub. Was greeted right away by three people behind the counter and ordered my simple plain cheesesteak. Place was clean, sandwich was great and service was nice and fast. Only took about 2-3 minutes and no one yelled my ordered and instead one of the sandwich guys brought it to me from behind the counter. Nice touch. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Evyn and Quinton were awesome. Got the #9 and it was great. Boyfriend loved the chicken parm so much he got another. And the free yelp cookie is amazing. Like seriously try the peanut butter cookie. Will be back."}
{"text":"The manager Danny was very helpful and very nice . Made my food to order very hot and good .  Very friendly workers and plAce was very clean ."}
{"text":"This location lacks customer service , attitude all the way , from everyone not just one . Since we walked in until we paid and left . Horrible ! You don't like your job get a new one paying customers pay for your check ! I would rather go to Jimmy Johns across the street atleast they make you feel welcomed ! The lady at the register was horrible ! I'm a big believer in treating others the way you would like to be treated . If this place wants to succeed employees need training in customer service and knowing what they have to do , had to repeat my order 4 times or have a cheat sheet in the back or something. I don't think I would return . i will drive to another jersey mikes if I want this sub"}
{"text":"Love jersey mikes. Don't love this location. The middle aged female manager (wearing headphones around her neck behind the counter) wiped her hands on her soiled apron after washing them in the sink and then proceeded to make sandwiches..gross! Scared to see what happens behind the scenes.   The sandwiches are quite tasty for a quick lunch spot. Parking lot is a little confusing, expect to park behind the building during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Good food, good service.  The dining area is very small, so I suggest take-out.  Parking is almost impossible at 12pm so arrive early."}
{"text":"So I decided to give it another shot. This location is garbage. Went with the philly steak and cheese has onions and peppers on it. So it's a little steak and all cheese, onions, and peppers. Just nasty. All you can taste is the cheese and bread. I'm sure everything is portion out, but seriously with a drink for $11 dollars it's a joke. I had two bites of my soggy cheesy sub and threw it away! Love throwing my hard earned money away! Be better off going to subway. I'm done with this place when it first opened the quality was great now all they care about is quantity. Go to Jimmy Johns much better, and you get the same size sub for a couple bucks less. Only bright spot was at least they had bread this time to serve subs! Last time I went in they didn't even have that. Time before that no white bread!"}
{"text":"This place is trash! Everything was dirty, the meat slicer, the cutting boards, and it was a slow day. Saw the guy attempt to wipe down a table with a napkin while he was sweeping the lobby. He helped a customer without washing his hands. Surprised this place is still in business."}
{"text":"I would like to start off this review by saying this is my first Yelp review. I'm not the type of person who does this sort of thing. Although, when kudos are deserved, kudos are given. I walked into jersey mikes with no idea what I wanted to eat. As I was standing there staring at the menu, Nicola warmly welcomed me to Jersey Mike's and asked me what I would like. I told her I had no idea and asked for her recommendation. She recommended that I try the chipotle philly cheese steak. I took her word for it and placed my order. Nicola quickly prepared my order,  it was done immediately after I paid for my meal. I can confidently say it was one of the BEST philly cheese steaks I've ever had. Thanks to Nicola's hospitality and great sandwich making skills I walked out of Jersey Mikes thoroughly satisfied. I will now be a repeat customer and it's all because of Nicola. Promote her."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times, but the last time I went I ordered a philly cheesesteak, to go. I took it home just to find out the meat was not cooked all the way through. Absolutely disgusting! I will never go back here again."}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes is one of my favorite Sub Shops! We were greeted when we walked in and the workers were very friendly. The assistant manager David checked on us after receiving our food to make sure we were satisfied and happy. This location was very clean and welcoming. Our food was fresh and delicious!! Great experience and we will definitely go back!! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Jersey Mike's for years, first in Ohio, then in Florida, and now in AZ.  The first location I visited in AZ wasn't disappointing, but didn't live up to my desire for perfection.  While this store isn't perfect, it's close.  They're friendly, fast, and the food is great.  I go once a week or so and love it every time.  Very impressed by this location."}
{"text":"Even better than the sandwiches is the customer service. All of the people are so friendly and no in a fake way.They all just really seem to be genuinely nice.  The sandwiches are good and the service was very fast. I tried the place because of peoples recommendations on FB and glad I did."}
{"text":"WARNING: these subs are super addictive! My absolute favorite place to grab a sandwich! They are not only delicious, but the staff are always super friendly. They make picking up a sandwich fun and entertaining! If you've never been to Jersey Mike's, you have to check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm eating my first ever Jersey Mike's wrap as I write this, and I have to say Jameson really made the  experience awesome! His customer service was par none, and I know what I'm talking about cause I work in customer service myself. I hope anyone on the fence about this place will go for it. The food is delicious and the service is impressive. Happy noms."}
{"text":"It's all a matter of preference, but Jersey Mikes and Dave's Cosmic Subs are my favorite chain sandwich shops in town."}
{"text":"I received a coupon for my birthday for a free lunch so I chose to use it yesterday. Wow! The sandwich was great! Way better than the competitor's! The people who worked there were so friendly and nice. The restaurant was clean. I chose to take my food to work and eat it, but I would definitely eat there. I will absolutely go back. Everything is made fresh to your liking and very quickly. If you are looking for something yummy in a hurry, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Picture this...you go to your favorite sub joint, order your favorite subs, get them home, sit down ready to dig in and your wife says \"this is tuna and jalapeños\".  WTH...her favorite sub is The American Mike's way....damn... Of course I need to drive the 15 minutes with the gross sub...ticked off that my cheese steak is sitting on the counter...quality quickly decreasing...finally make it through rush hour traffic...drag that gross sub into the store and let the guy know I was given the incorrect sub.  Of course he makes the correct one right away.  Here's where my disappointment really hits home...no offer of a free sub, no offer to bump up my points on my membership...nothing.  Barely got a sorry...the moral of the story boys and girls....make sure you get the right sub to start with cus you ain't gettin jack if it's wrong.  I'm rating on this experience only...normally the give you what you ordered...sometimes slow...but that's a story for another time...enjoy your sub.."}
{"text":"This place is awful second time here in a week. First time they had only wheat bread. Come back a week later wait in line for 15 min to find out they have no bread at all. Can't even order!!!! This time they blame a fundraiser, well great be prepared. Girl taking orders said she knew nothing about it!! Great management!! Won't be back this is unbelievable!! I hope no one ever comes here they do not deserve to be in business with this type of management or ownership!!"}
{"text":"Great food but horrible service! While I was ordering the lady with black hair and pale skin took my order and just had such an attitude like she just wanted us to get the fuck out. Later while eating she answered the phone so unprofessionally then slammed the phone to hang up. Food was great though no complaints here but as for the workers god help them anywhere else they decide to work."}
{"text":"This location has renewed my faith in this sandwich chain! I know it's a newer location, hence, not getting 5 stars YET. Also I was sent coupons for this location and drove 15 minutes to see that they were still not open yet.  I used to frequent the S Eastern and Paradise locations a couple times a week. I eat a lot of sandwiches. For some reason, about 2-3 years ago, I had a string of about 6-7 times I went to the other locations mentioned, and received old, dry beach sand-textured bread. Totally ruined the sandwich, ESPECIALLY at this price point. Everyone knows bread makes or breaks the sandwich, the dough makes or breaks the pizza, and the ranch dressing makes or breaks the salad, haha, but true.. So in short, I went back to my old fav chain, Jimmy John's for the past 2-3 years.  I've now been at this location 4 times, and the sandwiches always taste like they should, and the employees are FAST, FRIENDLY, and keep the store clean."}
{"text":"I am so sad - this is the last sub place in the area and I was once again disappointed. The sandwich I ordered was not prepared properly, so I am unable to eat it. The reason I requested certain items not be added to my order is because they make me sick, VERY sick. Today is the last time I order from Jersey Mikes - or any sub place. I am seriously bummed that they could not get the order correct. I would recommend if you have special needs to not order from this place. I really wish someone would open a sub place that caters to people with special diets. I would be the first one at their door!"}
{"text":"This is an update - In my first review of Jersey Mike's, I noted that you can get exactly what you ask for if you ask for a little extra of this or that.  Well, that was then and this is now.  My two most recent visits have caused me to revise my statement.  Now, I need to tell you to PAY ATTENTION as they make your sandwich, because out of four sandwiches ordered over two visits, every one of them had an error.  First, it was the completely wrong sandwich.  Then, for the others, an item was either forgotten to be added or deleted.    I still like this shop and their food, and I will go back.  But I will be much more vigilant as they prepare my food so I get the right sandwich the right way.  You should pay attention to yours, too."}
{"text":"This review is on the Giant Philly Cheese Steak ONLY. I can't speak for the other subs because I have not tried them. Let's begin... Mmmm...Where to begin? ... O.K., I have read the reviews here on yelp before going to Jersey Mikes. Yes, all of the reviews are true. The good and the bad. I'm going to be honest and say that the sandwich part with the meat and cheese and bread were 5 STARS! Pictures don't lie, well, yes they can with Photoshop, but this is not photshoped. Just look at the photo, very sad pic of an under dressed sub. Back to the review of the sandwich, First, I used the online ordering for my sandwich and was told my sub would be ready at 2:37pm, I placed my order about an hour earlier. I arrived at the Surprise, AZ location at 2:39pm. Guess what, no sub ready. The girl at the register was the only one visible in the store and she said she just got there and had no idea where it was. She went looking for the order and said they don't make the hot subs until just before the scheduled arrive time. Not true, because I was standing there at 2:39 with no sandwich in hand. To make a long story short, trust me there is more to our conversation, very bad customer service and operating procedures from management. I left the store at 2:45pm. Knock a star and a half for this infraction. Now to the tasting of the sub. AWESOME! I ordered it with bacon and wow! Now for the knocking off of another star and a half. Pictures speak louder than words. No cheese in the middle and the ends are both empty air in bread!?! Like I stated before, the sandwich with the steak and cheese and bacon were AWESOME good! Jersey Mike owners of this location, you have a problem and you need to fix it. Long story short again, $16.37 for the sub, that's with tax. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Shout out to today's lunch crew for great attitudes and energy!  Today was JM's Nationwide Day of Giving and 100% of today's sales in PHX will go directly to Phoenix Children's Hospital.    When I got there at 12:00 there was a line out the door but the team was positive, helpful, and even joked \"who wouldn't want to be here today?\" as they completed my order.  Big tip, if you are in a hurry/pressed for time, use their online ordering system and skip the line.  Great food and great attitudes here!"}
{"text":"Great tasting subs made fresh!   Subs are a little scant on meat unless you order extra meat.  Overall very tasty!    My favorite is the #11 ham and salami with provolone cheese."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop in town. The manager is awesome I think her name is Sam as well as the crew. The service top notch. The restaurant is always clean. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Still a good sandwich shop and great staff but there are better sandwich joints around town"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are consistently good at every location I've been to, but the young people working here at the Flower Mound location are extremely nice and pleasant. They seem to be having fun at work but are respectful and courteous to customers. I would imagine it's difficult to hire responsible teenagers but they seem to do a great job here."}
{"text":"I got a sub there once and I will never go back. There is very little meat and cheese on the sub I got and very little flavor. They definitely are overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"This location of Jersey Mike's is great!  The staff behind the counter are excellant and are very polite!  They always greet you when you enter the restaurant and the smile never leaves their faces throughout your whole order!  My go-to sandwiches are the #13 Original Italian and #17 Jersey Mike's Famous Philly.  Always done to perfection and taste very fresh!"}
{"text":"Overall solid location.   I've been here a handful of times after accidentally discovering it was here. It's kind of hidden.   I've been here when it's super clean as well as super dirty so I'm guessing cleanliness depends on the staff that's present.   Food is comparable to other sub shops but the food is very filling. They have specials Monday-Frida which is a regular sub with a combo for $8 and some change which is a pretty good deal.  Minus 1 star for staff. Staff is pretty apathetic and not very helpful. I don't think I've ever seen any of the staff members smile before."}
{"text":"I came into Jersey Mikes today to give them another shot because the owner was so receptive to my original criticisms. I'm happy to say that this experience was amazing. What a turn around. The staff was friendly and efficient. They were working as a team and customers were happy. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"New location with new staff so they are learning , but the sub was awesome!!!!! I have been searching for a sub place where I actually enjoy the sandwich and this is it ! The flavor  is amazing and everything is fresh!! I'm actually craving one now so I'm off to buy another !!"}
{"text":"Really good Subs. Ingredients are much higher quality than most sub shops I've been to around the area. I got the veggie wrap and ask them if they could make it spicy it had a good fight but not overpowering. Will definitely be going here again."}
{"text":"Five, five dollar, five dollar foot....er....er....NOT ANYMORE!  Goodbye Subway, hello Jersey Mike's. This is the place to go for subs. Fresh ingredients - especially the bread.  Meats are delicious and go for the Mike's Way for toppings. Employees are fantastic... Very nice, helpful, courteous.   And, the place is spic and span clean and spacious. Best Jersey Mike's I have been to.  Wish I knew where to get the coupons the other reviewer mentioned.  I live for the #13!!"}
{"text":"I got a sub club and got it Mikes way, despite my reservations for the vinegar and oil I wanted a true grinder style sandwich.  It was really good, wish we would have ate there so the bread didn't get soggy I HATE soggy bread.  So I ended up picking the goods off the bread twords the end of my sandwich.  We'll be back want to try the philly!"}
{"text":"I was anxious to try the Ruben because I love Togo's pastrami Ruben. Upon entering the staff was super friendly. The next thing I noticed was the price. It was a little steep. Just under $7 bucks for the regular and almost $12 for the big one. They should have something in between. They warmed up the pastrami on the grill and melted the Swiss then loaded it onto the roll. I noticed that they actually slice the cheese fresh which is impressive. I was pretty disappointed in the sandwich. The pastrami had little taste and the bred was kind of overwhelmingly dry. My son had the same thing and definitely agreed. Not only was the taste lacking but he was still hungry since I just got him a regular. I'm not a subway fan, but considering the cost and taste I would go there over here. I doubt we will be going back."}
{"text":"I won't hear anyone attempting to take anything away from the quality of a Jersey Mike's sub. They make a tasty sandwich with seriously good ingredients. Were I reviewing based on taste alone, we would be talking about five stars.  But you can't get out of there with a reasonable meal for anything less than ten bucks. Mike should be grateful that my price-sensitive ass is only removing one star for that."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but excellent sammys. I recommend the Philly cheesesteak. It's excellent!"}
{"text":"I typically hit the East Blvd location, but downtown for lunch I decided to check out this location. The line was almost out the door! Although it moves somewhat quickly the service is very chaotic and I was charged for the order behind me. Overall, I enjoy the subs, but this location was a little more disappointing than my other experiences."}
{"text":"Great service & sandwiches. I ordered the mini club, jersey's way, with chips and a drink. The meats are shaved thin & you get to choose your toppings of choice. A great lunch sport, however the parking lot does get full during lunch hours."}
{"text":"First time ever eating here and we loved it ! Love how they slice all the meat as they're making your sandwich."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst! Never again am I eating at Jersey Mike's!   I have eaten at Jersey Mike's in San Diego before. I didn't really think much of it. But my flight was delayed and this seemed to be the only place to grab a quick dinner at McCarran.   Firstly, the bread lady ignored me and proceeded to take the order from her friend who was standing behind me. I get it I am tiny but I am not invisible!  I had to get the bread lady's attention and ordered the veggie sandwich. She proceeded to cut my bread without changing her gloves after cutting her friend's turkey/ham/monstrous piece of whatever meat. I didn't really say anything because I wasn't sure how Jersey Mike's works.   Now the vegetable lady who has my bread goes \"Oh veggie, do you want me to change my gloves?\" I am like yes please! The bread lady hears this and smirks and she and her friend exchange knowing glances!   What the hell bread lady! You knew you were supposed to change your gloves before making my order. Fine you probably forgot to. But you could have at least offered to switch my bread once you realized it.   Also just realized the cheese goes through the same meat cutter! :X  Jersey Mike's has fewer options for bread, vegetables and sauces. And the sandwiches are not toasted. Yet Jersey Mike's is more expensive than Subway or Quiznos. How you stay in business is beyond me!  Zero for customer service and zero for taste. You should just call yourself Sub-Zero! :P  Run vegetarians/vegans run!"}
{"text":"Better sandwiches than the other choices in the area. Depends a lot on who's working behind the counter, though. Some of them don't know how to make a wrap; some are more generous with the fillings than others."}
{"text":"To me this is now the best sub shop in Cleveland and I have been to them all used to be Dibella's but they no longer have as much meat . at jersey mikes for one flat rate I can double the meat which I always do as I like loads of meat my favorite sub is the Italian I always get the giant they are always very nice I am allergic to tomato seeds so they put no tomato the only other place near as good is penn station but they have less meat and no double option plus more expensive I go to the shop at Westgate mall I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Brandt greeted us today with a friendly smile. He was very helpful helping my boyfriend choose a sandwich since it was his first time saying \"I'll make sure to take care of you\". I really appreciated how nice and helpful he was. Even as we were eating I watched him walk around and clean the tables and make sure everything was presentable. I will definitely be back and I hope Brandt is here to help!"}
{"text":"Update: They apologized for the mistake and corrected it willingly. It appears the quality is more consistent now. Highly recommended :)  Do not eat here.   The sandwiches are entirely dry, even if you request it \"Mike's way\" which is supposed to have oil and vinegar.  I'm thoroughly disappointed by the lack of customer service from Jersey Mike's. I ordered a sandwich at the store on Alma School Rd. And Queen Creek Rd, in Chandler, AZ and when I got home I opened the wrapper and found that there was no oil and vinegar on the sandwich at all in spite of the fact I asked for it \"Mike's Way\". I tried eating the sandwich but it was too dry. I called back and the woman there told me I could come back the next day and they would remake it because they would leave a note with my name and number by the register. I was impressed initially, however when I went into the store the individual at the register would not honor the promise that was made. This has been a terrible experience as they incorrectly made the sandwich. I would have been okay if they honored their promise to remake it for me, however they have shown they cannot be trusted."}
{"text":"Just left about 35 minutes ago and had another great experience. My GF wanted to split the sandwich so we complicated the order, but the girl working was helpful and got us what we wanted. Mhhhhhhhmh I love these sandwiches and I get a free one next time with my points."}
{"text":"Really enjoy everything about this place. The staff is always very friendly, and the subs are great, no matter which one you pick. I have tried the Italian, Rueben, Cheesesteak, they are all delicious. I love the hot subs, and how soft the bread is.  I have to say, the service has improved tremendously since it's opening last year, the staff seems to be well trained, and very knowledgeable about the menu.  I highly recommend going to try this place out if you haven't yet. No matter which sub you choose, it does not disappoint."}
{"text":"My first experience at Jersey Mikes was great! I'm a vegetarian, so when I ordered my sub they cleaned the slicer for me so I had a nice clean blade! I have also since then tried their grilled veggie wrap and that was very good! By far my favorite sub shop! OH! Can't forget their bread! It's so pillowy and soft! Gotta get it Mikes way!!! Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Wife just came home with Mike's, she says they all whined when she walked in the door at 800pm, \"we just cleaned the grill\" she asked \"well what time do you close?\" answer 900, then they proceeded to jack up her order saying they only have one size, and made one of the sandwiches on the wrong bread, not noticed till she got home, the food tasted fine, the food is usually fine just the service has always been mediocre at best.  Hire some people that care about what they do even if it is just making sandwiches."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is okay. It's a chain place, and a bit over priced for fast food.  I ordered a philly cheese steak.  It was mostly bread, with a few thing microscopic slices of meat.  A little cheese too.  And a sliver or two of peppers.  But mostly, it was bread.  I think it's funny the people that work here try to make small talk with you.  \"So, what are you guys up to tonight?\"  I think it would be fun to just try and f*#k with them, and say something like, \"Oh you know, smoking a little meth and just chilling with some hookers.\"  See what they say to that."}
{"text":"Decent sandwiches, pretty standard Mike's here.  Doubt I'll ever be back in Laveen to come here again though."}
{"text":"I love the philly cheese steak here.  There isn't a lot of meat on it, but the cheese is melted so much it's almost liquified.  Really tasty.  It's a little on the pricey side- more so that Subway anyways, and unless you're hungry just get the Regular.  The large sandwich is HUGE."}
{"text":"They ran out of bread and we're trying to charge full price to get it in a bowl instead. And they didn't tell me this until I wasted a bunch of time in line... by then most of the other options were closed. Boy I'm pissed off about this. Adding more insult to an already delayed flight.   Definitely my new last airport option."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and I won't do it again. I got their Original Italian cold sub @ $8.65 for a regular 8 inch sandwich. It has 5 different lunch meats but they all taste the same, very bland. I had them not put the dressing on the sandwich because I was going to take it home and I didn't want to have a soggy sandwich. When I opened the sandwich at home it was a soggy mess. The top bun was just mush when I tried to take it off and when I took a taste to see if it was dressing, it was just water. I threw the bun away and used a half hoagie roll from the bread works that I had gotten yesterday. I remade the sandwich because the lettuce was wilted so I scraped off the veggies from the sandwich and put my fresh lettuce, tomatoes, pepperoceni  peppers and dressing. Basically, I just used their lunch meat. This was a mistake, after doing all this, I found out how tasteless the meats are. I ate about half of the sandwich and pulled the lunchmeat out and ate my veggie hoagie."}
{"text":"Great Food - Great Service - every time I come here the employees are fantastic- they always get my order correct and the food is FRESH. It is a  good old fashion \"SUB SANDWICH\" -   Employes are very helpful too-"}
{"text":"When I first tried Jersey Mike's I LOVED this place, but their quality at this location has just completely dropped over the past 4-5 months to the point where we will not be returning as customers. Lately our sandwiches have been messy, soggy (I have attached a photo of my completely soggy bread) bland and missing ingredients. For the price you pay here, the food should be on point! They're on subway's level of crappy quality now.... Very Disappointed, and peeved."}
{"text":"It's good, but didn't really blow me away.   Steakenburger's Philly Cheesesteak tastes far superior and also a better value at 7.50."}
{"text":"First time trying Jersey Mike's last week for lunch.  Wow!  I had the Original Philly Cheese steak and it was the best!  Lunch hour was pretty busy.  I waited probably 10 minutes for my food.  Customer service was great.  Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"This was me and my family's first time eating here..... Not impressed at all... The roast beef that was made in house was bland.the meat portions seemed less than Subway .The tomatoes looked old and soft. Staff was friendly all tho the place was dirty. Soda machine holding nasty water in the tray. Don't think we will be returning. Not a happy experience."}
{"text":"Jersey mikes has the freshest meats around,the subs are great. They are truly jersey subs but he makes them hot too. Always consistently fresh sorry subway doesn't even come close .. His bread is the best too"}
{"text":"I like the subs and would give a higher score except the prices are too high. It is $8 for a regular size turkey sub which is significantly higher than at PotBelly and Firehouse, both of which are a little better quality. I only went here because it was the only sub place close by at the time."}
{"text":"Came here after an unfortunate dining experience elsewhere. I originally ordered the turkey and provolone, but they were out of turkey, so I settled for a chicken parm. It was pretty good, but the service was slow. They carved the meat in front of me, so I assumed it was pretty fresh, but I have been to fresher sandwich shops. However, the kitchen was open and very clean, they had nothing to hide."}
{"text":"This location has a serious odor which is discouraging for expecting FRESH food. The service was lackluster. I'll probably stick with the Jersey Mike's in Huntersville for now or the alternative Jimmy John's nearby."}
{"text":"We had placed an online order last weekend to save some time, however when we started to open our subs, we were surprised that 4 out of our 5 subs were made wrong. After calling, we were told that we could return to have our order remade. We chose to do so and returned this weekend. As promised, our 4 subs were remade with out problem and the team was professional and courteous. I tried a Philly cheesesteak this time, which was good. They are a bit more expensive than their competitors, however we enjoy the flavors and the menu selections. I am glad to see that a few more locations are starting to pop up around the valley too, however online ordering is not yet an option at all locations I've noticed. It would be convenient if the order was correct in the end."}
{"text":"After a bad experience, owner Duane Layton reached out and made it up to me went back today and had a great experience that I am use to having. They acted quick on my complaint and made it better! Thank you guys"}
{"text":"I am not sure where to begin because there is a lot wrong with this place. It was disorganized! They have different stations for hot subs and cold subs so one guy would come around and would take hot sub orders only. It was confusing because the our subs were done at different times. The main thing slowing everything down was that they had one guy cutting all the meat and cheese. They should have two cutting stations for when it gets really busy. The staff was nice but there was a lot of confusion and yelling about who ordered what. It was painful watching this especially because I was starving. I would suggest ordering ahead if you can to avoid the same dilemma. By the time we got home and finally ate our subs we concluded the amount of time it took to get them didn't justify the taste. I mean they were subs and nothing special. Certainly not worth a 45 minute wait in a cluster storm."}
{"text":"So, I would never come back here if the subs weren't so good or if there was a different location close to me. The service is always extremely slow and even sandwiches that I order online through the app and just want to pick up are never ready. Today when I went in, there was a guy behind the counter, putting vegetables on the sandwiches. He goes to the end of the line by the door to the kitchen and sneezes about seven times in a row. I think I heard a customer ask him to wash his hands, which he did, and then he put his gloves back on but continued to touch his nose with his wrist it was disgusting."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time back in the 90's, and it was the best!!   If this store is still the way it used to be, than I highly recommend you stop in and order up!!    Even when the line would back up onto the sidewalk they would have runners taking your hot sandwich orders and the line would always roll smoothly with hardly a wait.  The ower himself would cook all the hot sandwiches,,,he sure had this place running like a well oiled machine!!  I wish the Jersey Mike's where I live now were this good!"}
{"text":"We were greeted with smiles, right when we entered. I always order a #2 Mike's way. My husband tried a wrap and loved it. I appreciate the consistency in food freshness and care put into making the sandwiches. We travel a lot and trust the brand. This location was great!"}
{"text":"First time I had Mike's was in NC.  I have to say they make an excellent sub."}
{"text":"My bf and I love this location because every time we come we are always serviced by wonderful people. This visit we came in at 8:45pm and Kirsten and Shay (don't know if I spelled their names right) were super friendly and quick to make our orders. Usually we try to avoid going somewhere when its close to closing because they make us feel rushed but these ladies were very professional and friendly through our entire interaction. Thank you ladies!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was so unbelievably filthy (behind the counter and in the dining room). I went before dinner rush had even started, but it was disgusting. I feel like I'm risking food poisoning if I eat there, so I will not be back. I've been to plenty of other Jersey Mike's locations and have never seen another shop with such a disregard for cleanliness."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, 3 young guys working tonight one employee says to the other in front of 5 customers that he hates his job. The other kid wouldn't even look at me, he set my sandwich on the counter I said thank you and have a good night...no response and didn't even look in my direction!!! It doesn't kill you to be pleasant to people, have a smile on your face and say thank you!!! So RUDE!!!"}
{"text":"Love their Subs! And wraps are good too. Excellent meat and cheese combos with peppers and jalapeños! Yum"}
{"text":"It was just an average sub. A little lite on the meat for the price you pay.  About the same as Subway but Subway is less expensive."}
{"text":"Seriously, Jersey Mikes!!! Your subs are all bread... they literally gave me 3 slices of turkey for a $15 Giant sub. Forget about putting special instructions for online orders in the box because they don't read them anyway. Very disappointed with my last online order!!!"}
{"text":"Sub was good and fresh, Mike's Way Called in order, very slow service, we arrived 15 minutes after call for a 10 min pick up and sandwiches were just started, watched them sprinkle, they seemed confused."}
{"text":"First time at Jersey Mikes and loved it!  Customer service is excellent. Kyle and Quana were extremely friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had to ask Jeff 3 times not to glob the mayo before he finally listened and spread it well on my sandwich, he didn't give me a receipt or a fork. Not pleased. He could care less about customers."}
{"text":"Love jersey mikes! Their roast beef is the best of any sandwich chain. Good service, quality food"}
{"text":"Despite my prior hum-drum experiences here, I went back yesterday, as I was in the area and was in serious need of a sandwich - nothing else was gonna cut it.  The joint was busy - surely a good sign.  And my main previous gripe was addressed - they were putting quite adequate quantities of meat on all of the sandwiches I watched being made, mine included.  I had ham, pepperoni & provolone on a white roll.  The ham was excellent.  FAR better overall impression than my previous visits here.  Still expensive, but with more meat this time, not unreasonable.  I dare say I'm now a fan and will be back.. we'll see if this was a fluke or perhaps my past visits were."}
{"text":"Yay, another New Jersey Mike's location nearby. I almost always get the Italian (#13) because you wind up with at least 2x more meat than any of the single meat sandwiches. Be careful when letting them make it \"Mike's way\" - Mike apparently LOVES his oil & vinegar, and specifies that your sandwich be absolutely drowned in the stuff. I've seen this at every location I've been to, so it's some sort of corporate edict apparently. If you take your sandwich to go, it completely soaks the bread by the time you're ready to eat it, not very pleasant. I always ask them to \"go easy on the juice\" and it's just right. Good stuff, far better than any other chain operation I've been to, and they slice your meats & cheese right in front of you, not at some commissary in Cleveland 3 weeks ago."}
{"text":"Such a nice staff, I meant to order the cheesesteak and I said the wrong number and instead of making me pay for a new one, they replace it no problem, even through it was my mistake, most places would have made me pay for a new one, so for that reason along they have earn my business, plus the food is great, who ever own this store your staff is amazing"}
{"text":"These guys always make me feel good when I see them. And they aren't shy and they know how to make guess feel at home! Thanks guys the store was very clean and my sub was amazing as always this store is very consistence. If you want a recommendation on a great cold sub try the Italian/number13 mikes way or if your feeling like a hot meal any of the cheesesteaks are BOMB!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is awesome and the subs a fresh and great too. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Super good.  I love getting my stuff Mike's way.  The staff is always friendly and upbeat. I love that all their subs are so fresh.  My favorite place for subs for sure!"}
{"text":"Where do I start with this one. I've never liked the staff at this location, just a bunch of dudes who you can tell don't really give a **** about making a good sandwich. Called ahead to order two sandwiches for my wife and myself during our work lunch. Ordered the roast beef and provolone, as I have a hundred times. The roast beef was so old that is was practically grey, and honestly tasted like old cold pot roast. Our order was VERY basic. But of course they forgot like 3 of the 5 ingredients we had asked for on my wife's sub. Blew my mind. I mean guys, it's a sandwich order, how the hell do you forget to put on 3 ingredients. Told my wife that this was it, final straw with jersey mikes. Long time lost customers at last. I did the math, we spent 1300 a year on jersey mikes (once a week). There are roughly 500 million people in the US? Imagine if only 10,000 people shared the same sentiment, and had the same spending profile as we did. Jersey mikes, you can do the math. Subway lost us awhile ago too, look what's happened to them. We can't be the only ones."}
{"text":"Just a quick stop off the highway to get some lunch. Generally, Jersey Mike's doesn't travel well but if you go without the lettuce and without the oil and vinegar, it's *possible* that you'll only end up covered in bread crumbs by the time you get down the highway.  Today I just got the roast beef with tomato and mustard. Easy to eat while blasting down the Interstate at 70 miles an hour. Not too difficult to get to from the highway and easy enough to get back on.  The staff was doing the best that they could despite a family with four kids that had apparently never been to a place where you get to ask for what you want as they make it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for take out dinner because I really didn't want to cook. It was great. My sandwiches were assmbled quickly, topped to order and wrapped properlu. When I got them home, they were very enjoyed.  One tip: The numbers of the sandwiches on the menu across other Jersey Mike's seems to change. So be aware!"}
{"text":"I like Jersey Mike's because they cut the meat right then and there when you order it. They don't have a tub full of stuff sitting there for hours and hours. I think that makes for a fresher tasting sandwich compared to the 'way guys. And when they slice, they tend to pour it on pretty heavy so I'd recommend being really friendly to the person taking your order and you can maybe expect an extra slice or two on there.  This is a nice clean shop. I'd come back."}
{"text":"A sub shop where they slice the meat right onto the roll as it's being prepared. Short of going to the actual butcher, does it get fresher than that? Service was not speedy, but only because there were already three people in queue when we arrived.  Tip: The \"giant\" is giant. Only if you're really hungry or splitting it with someone!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and a bonus for being open later (until 9!) than another Jersey Mike's that was closed when I was suddenly told that we wanted Jersey Mike's for dinner. Okay!  Not much parking but late on a Sunday this wasn't a problem. Two people working tonight and they did a fab job of preparing three great subs to order. Topped appropriately \"Mike's Way\" and wrapped up to go.  Unwrapping our dinner back at the ranch, they were excellent subs and the Mrs. was pleased. Well done, Mike's."}
{"text":"My daughter is visiting from a place where they do not have Jersey Mike's and so she made a special request. Easy enough, this restaurant is clean and bright and has plenty of parking, as it's one of the out-buildings from the nearby Harris Teeter.  Inside, the same JM menu and setup. We ordered our sandwiches \"Mike's Way\" which comes with lettuce and tomato and salt and pepper and oil and vinegar. It gets a little messy but it's tasty.  They have a soda fountain and a selection of chips."}
{"text":"Usually I loooove Jersey Mike's so I was really stoked to see one while I was visiting. I was a little disappointed because the bread wasn't as fresh as at any other location where I've been. The rest of the sandwich was fine though and still beats any other sub shop around."}
{"text":"Very rude service, when asked if they had avocado or lite mayo, the gage wielding sandwich maker informed me she \"wasn't Subway.\" While I enjoy the food, I hate the snark and won't be returning."}
{"text":"I started going to Jersey Mike's recently as it's along my route to work in the winter.  I found using the smart phone app was incredibly convenient.  I could make an order, have it paid for, and snag it in a matter of minutes. I literally walk to the register, they ask my first name and hand over the goods. Another plus, the app tracks your reward points, and rewards you with subs as your points accumulate.  I love this amenity!  This store is located on a street with every chain sandwich store imaginable in NE Ohio, but I don't find their sandwiches as good as Jersey Mike's.  Whether you like your subs hot or cold, they have plenty of options.  I find their Italian sub very good (cold) but on the coldest days I prefer their Philly Chicken or Beef sandwiches. I haven't had their wraps, but I am sure they are fine.  They offer chips, cookies, sodas and other beverages, but I mostly stick to the subs. Jersey Mike's offers catering, but I haven't had the pleasure of being at an event that has used it.  I agree with their slogan, they are indeed a \"Sub Above\"."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and exceptional service! Gave me extra cheese on my sandwich at no charge which makes me a huge fan!! I frequent the Jersey Mike's in San Diego and was visiting Las Vegas with a friend. She'd never been to any Jersey Mike's, so I thought I'd introduce her. She loved it as well; the only complaint is that they didn't have chips to her satisfaction... She's the PICKIEST eater in the UNIVERSE so don't even fret about that. If I ever need Jersey Mike's while I'm in Vegas again, I will definitely come back to this one!"}
{"text":"Been there three times already. Fresh sliced sandwiches to order. 100% better than the Subways that was there before. Please keep up with consistency and I will be back again and again"}
{"text":"Great sandwich with fresh bread. With a regular sub being 7.5 inches plenty of food for a good price. Guys know how to make a mean sandwich."}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes has delicious subs. I prefer their food to Capriottis."}
{"text":"Decided to give jersey Mike's another chance. That was a mistake, slow as always even though I placed the order online. The person working the cash register couldn't even be heard over the noise inside and although I was standing there waiting for 10 minutes he never noticed that the sub was sitting in the warming been. Poor execution.   Finally when I asked him again he noticed with no apology handed me the sub. I doubt I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I was happy when they moved in because I get my coffee next door everyday.  I hope they last longer than the previous tenant.  I order roast beef on wheat, lettus, tomatoes,  onion wth salt and pepper. ..every time.  Alway fresh always good!"}
{"text":"I was reluctant to try Jersey Mike's for so long, ignoring the advice of my co-workers, thinking that I had a \"superior NY sandwich palate.\" Subway and other chain delis fed my thoughts that I would never ever ever enjoy any sandwich coming from a chain deli restaurant. Welp... I couldn't have been more wrong. I'm literally addicted to Jersey Mike's. #9 Club Supreme Mike's way + pickles and mayo is the way to go. The bread is baked nice every time - crispy yet doughy on the inside. Plus the call ahead is fantastic and really quick. All meats and toppings are super fresh and piled high. I'm never hungry after having a regular size sub.  So quick story... I work very close to this location and I happened to be working the day after July 4th, Friday 7/5. I placed an order online at 4pm (really late lunch) not realizing they closed at 3pm that particular day because of the holiday. So my debit card was charged, but no sandwich. I called up next day and they were really sorry for the situation and gave me a refund right away over the phone. I spoke to the manager again the next time in and he gave me a free sub no questions asked!   Ironically, the manager was named Mike... major kudos to you! Couldn't ask for better service recovery there! I'm one happy loyal customer!"}
{"text":"So I've lived down the street for almost three years now.  I figured it's about time i try  this place out.  It was honestly even better than i expected!  I'd heard good things.  But wow!  My only complaint was that the wheat bread tasted a little too dry for my taste.  I got the Veggie, of course, and I found it to be an excellent blend of veggies and cheese!  Good chip selection, excellent Mango iced tea!  So tasty!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes is a small chain of sub shops based on a store in New Jersey (duh).   The sandwiches are about average. Nothing about the sandwich is excellent, but nothing is poor.   Every now and then I'm in the mood for a sandwich and it's a decent option."}
{"text":"Still enjoying this location at least once week.  Best sub around in my opinion.  Nice people there too.   Prompt service even when they are slammed for the lunch rush.  They have a pretty efficient assembly line thing going and you move right along.  My fav is the Original Italian and the Super Sub is pretty great as well."}
{"text":"Amazing costumer service here! This my first time being at this establishment and all I can say your definitely going to see me here again. Fatima,Raquel, and Kyle attended me very respectfully and kindly recommend you letting them make your subs"}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's brings back some good memories for me when I would visit New Jersey and order the Italian subs from the delis around Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, North Bergen, and many other areas.  They have perfected the Italian sub sandwiches nicely. This location in particular was very helpful and provided discounts. The young men working behind the counters were attentive, handled my order accurately, and promptly. Great job!  I am a well balanced in my approach to food that entails me being a professional cook with many years experience in many types of cuisines from Latin America, Greek, Italian, American and many more. I take food as the ultimate pleasure in life along with many other things. I give my reviews based on my experiences eating out at least 2 times a day and 5-6 days a week. I rarely give 1 stars and most restaurants get an average rating 3 stars, with some very good restaurants or places receiving 4 stars, and those that stand out receive 5 stars.   This close to the Interstates so it's easy access and a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I passed this place on the way home from the other side of town and decided to give it a try. We just called in our order for pick up. The cute service was pretty friendly. The sandwiches were pretty good. We ordered regular sizes and they were pretty large, which is nice. There was nothing bad about the experience, but it also wasn't the best sandwich ever. I still prefer Jimmy John's. But this place was pretty good."}
{"text":"Hmmm.... I love jersey mikes, but it's not 5 star worthy. I'm a sandwich addict and jersey mikes is definitely one of my fav spots- but especially with this location sometimes it's not perfectly up to par. I order jersey favorite and get it mikes way add the cherry spread and a little mayonnaise. If you want a good quality yummy sandwich then this is a good spot- but not as many bread choices as other sub places such as submarina- or topping options as a subway (which jerseys is a million times better than)- but definitely worth a stop and one of your sandwich cravings!"}
{"text":"I had not been to a Jersey Mikes for quite sometime. But, I remembered they used to make really good subs. I really wasn't that impressed when I stopped in for lunch this last time. The bread was really good, but the sub was kind of bland and not what i had remembered. Maybe I will have to go back again and see if my mind will change. It was simply ok, nothing exciting about the sub."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  I love Jersey Mike's but, this location is a little sloppy when it comes to their subs. We ordered a turkey provolone mike's way and came home to find that it was drenched in oil and vinegar. Everything was so soggy :( I couldn't finish my half because the vinegar was so strong. But, I get it. There an uptown establishment at the peak of lunch time. The sandwich did however, have the right amount of veggies, meat, and cheese, I know some locations try to jip you.   Then again, the Jersey Mike's near the old 131 main always gets it right despite the length of the line. I recommend coming here if you have the time. Their subs are delicious."}
{"text":"I would like to recognize employee Nikki from the East Blvd. location. If she isn't management already, she sure should be. We come in quite frequently, I'd say once a week for the last 2 years. I have never seen such a nice, caring, and upbeat employee such as Nikki. She has never had a bad mood ever and is always so welcoming and warm to both her customers and employees. During the recent Charlotte riots, she was so worried about her fellow coworkers getting home safely. Nikki is a wonderful person all in all.   Don't get me wrong, the entire Jersey Mike's staff from East Blvd. is outstanding. But, Nikki, she is a rising star. Please recognize her and consider her for a promotion and/or raise. If I had my own business, I would hire her myself. Her customer service skills are impeccable and nothing short of perfect.      I wanted to update my review today. I went out of my way to send this as a positive customer review to corporate Jersey Mike's. I meant everything I said, Nikki and her staff are wonderful and they are the real reason of what keeps me coming back to this Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Fun/fast crew make sandwiches for a delicious lunch option ! My sandwich guy had the best attitude and admitted that he ALWAYS has a great day . I'll be back for sure ;)"}
{"text":"Love Jersey Mike's. Being a back east girl I always go to Mike's when I want a sub. Always fresh meat & bread and gotta love they have Pepsi. Staff is always friendly and the beach pics remind me of home."}
{"text":"I went into Jersey Mike's today craving a #5.  The quality is always very consistent at this location.  My food was very good today.  The employees were very nice.  The restaurant was very clean- even the restroom.  I always drop a tip in the tip bucket.  The cookies at the register are good.  It is great to have a restaurant near-by that is consistently good."}
{"text":"Usually the experience at this place is good however, yesterday I am not sure if their staff was all new or something but I purchased a regular KAHUNA the first time I asked for no jalapeños and they were added and yesterday hardly any steak was on my sandwich. There is no consistency..."}
{"text":"I swear if people don't like their job they should find another one! My husband and I just went into this location 15 minutes ago and I'm already yelping smh! There were two employees working a male and a female, the male had major attitude, throwing bread, hitting the meat slicer! No joke! The female was nice but you could see she was getting frustrated with her coworker, I felt bad for her. Anyway the guy wasn't even asking us what we wanted on our sandwiches, throwing stuff on like he was irritated we were even there. It took everything in me to not just walk out (my husband has more patience then I do) eventually our sandwiches were correct, he began wrapping one sandwich and told his coworker to change the paper roll she pointed at her wrist and said I can't (her wrist was in a brace) That sent him through the roof irritated, he finally got the paper roll on only to become aware he had cut himself during his tantrum and took off into the back! I'm not sure if this guy is the manager or assistant manager or just an employee but he needs to find a different job! I won't be going back. If I could give zero stars I would!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Jersey Mike's. This location in particular is never overly busy, has fast & friendly staff and, most importantly, always delivers a consistent sandwich."}
{"text":"The overall experience was pretty good. I will probably go back - the only downside, in my opinion, is that the prices are rather high for a sandwich shop.  I paid $6 for a 5 1/2 inch sandwich (pre-tax).  The products used (meats, cheeses, veggies) are very good quality, but still the size of the sandwich didn't seem to match the overall price paid."}
{"text":"so i always go to the location on paradise and i tried to go to the one on simmons being its closer to my house. Attempted to order over the phone before work and the young girl who answered barely could take my order and not only that she told me 15 mins for 1 sandwich got to the location 20 mins laters still wasn't done i told her go ahead and cancel the order i ate jimmy johns cause they guarantee DELIVERY time when they couldnt even guarantee pick time smh i don't understand."}
{"text":"This Jersey Mike's in Stonecrest is the best Jersey Mike's I have ever been to. We only discovered Jersey Mike's last year after moving to Charlotte from North Jersey and it had every bit of that Jersey authenticity that we have been missing.  Minus the employees bad jersey attitudes.  All the employees rte so friendly.   As a kid from North Jersey we spent many summers in Pt Pleasant and the over all feel of Jersey Mike's really nails the jersey shore experience.  I can almost hear the music from the boardwalk and the waves crashing on the beach.   I highly recommend the #13 the original Italian.   Excellent!"}
{"text":"Excellent old school jersey sandwich shop.  Reminds me of a sub shop down the shore. To bad they don't have 1980's prices.  But we love Jersey Mike's anyway.   Can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"Best fast food sub place ever! Everyone that works here is super friendly. I love the club sub! Ask for it Mike's way. But no oil. My only complaint, they put way waaaaaay to much oil on the subs! But if you get them with out it they are Sooooooooooooo good!"}
{"text":"This is a very busy location especially on a Saturday the line goes into the dinning area. Really great team here despite how busy it is ! I was helped by a very nice guy named Jay. He seemed to be leading the team and helping new co workers as well as taking orders and having a great attitude.  Employees like this deserve recognition because now a days great service is very hard to come by. When someone like this displays a willingness to make customers happy little things like forgetting a topping or a long line wait dont really matter. You can tell this team works hard and I was very pleased . Jay is leader in life. And no. I don't even know this dude! Lol  first time at this location and I will return."}
{"text":"I can first start this off with Subway gives you more for you money but the subs here are sooo good! The peper relish is awesome. Sometimes there are way too many people in line but you know you can't say that's bad. I guess the long line reflects how good the food is! Make it less pricey and I would come here more often."}
{"text":"This Jersey Mike location for some reason will not cook their meats.  I've tried it a few times.  The steak was pink in some areas and when I ordered the chicken, it was barely cooked without getting someone sick.  Both sandwiches were terrible tasting and I threw half of it out. Do yourself a favor and stay clear away from this location."}
{"text":"fav place for a fast healthy sandwich. They shave the meat right in front of you, unlike subway... Who knows how long subway's meat has been sliced. YUCK!  Jersey Mikes over Subway all day every day! Order it mikes way!!  My fave sandwich: Turkey - Mikes way with banana peppers"}
{"text":"Two guys working, line was pretty full when I walked in. They helped everyone in no time at all. Fast, clean, and friendly. I will definitely return to this jersey mikes. A lot cleaner then the one off the 101 and bell."}
{"text":"I like Jersey Mike's.  This location opened in the last month or so; I went there right after it opened and also a couple weeks after.  I always get a cheesesteak with no peppers.  Both times the sandwich was good, up to par with other locations.  Like the other reviewer said, the employees were bantering back and forth with each other in a friendly way.    The toppings here are pretty limited, but they do slice the meats to order and give you a choice of white or wheat bread.  They have a few hot sandwiches, and offer sides of chips and cookies and have fountain drinks.  I always get a regular sub, since the giant ones are GIANT."}
{"text":"Philly, yes! This is a small store and i you go to Jersey Mikes, you know what they have. Staff was nice and my sammich was good, so really can't complain here. I'll be back for another."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place inside the airport!!  Never heard of it before, but similar to a Philly Cheesesteak style place or Submarine sandwiches!  It was about 9am and a sandwich sounded really good since I had been up since 6am and had not eaten breakfast.  I could now relax, I had a couple hours before departure, already checked in, went through TSA, etc etc!  I walked around the airport  area close to my terminal C first, but Jersey Mike's was definitely top of my list, I am very glad I came back.  Only 2 customers in front of me in line, and ordering seemed to go quickly.   I wanted something hot, so I got the Chipotle Steak sandwich.  They cooked the meat fresh right there too.  The guy who took my order was cool and friendly, he was also slicing the deli meats for other's sandwiches.  The girl at the register who I paid with was friendly and good customer service too.  I was having a pleasant morning :)  There are no tables/seating near Jersey Mike's, so I suggest you walk back towards Popeye's area, which is exactly what I did because I also wanted some Cajun fries to go with my sandwich ;)  There I found some empty tables/chairs, which was great because I did not want to eat near my terminal on a waiting seat!   At least I had my own table and was comfortable to take my time to enjoy my brekkie/early lunch.  The sandwich was GREAT, I really liked the soft white bread, Chipotle sauce flavor, and all the goodies in the sandwich. The meat was cut small, sauteed on the flat top grill, I think they put provolone cheese on it and wrapped it in foil, so it was all melty and still hot when I opened it.  It was a bit messy to eat, but I always carry Wet Ones with me and mini Bath & Body works hand sanitizer, it's important to keep your hands extra clean while traveling or anywhere eating out.  I enjoyed my sandwich and it definitely filled me up.  If I ever come across Jersey Mike's again, I would try a cold sandwich next time, more healthy choice.  It's a small simple menu, but everything looks good and fresh toppings."}
{"text":"These guys do a decent job on making subs. Much preferred over subway or other larger chain sub making shops. They seem to have a little bit better meat and quality overall. Fast friendly service. Plus if you sign up for their email they send you a free sub and drink via email on your birthday."}
{"text":"This is the worst JMs I've been to. Food is good but the service is off and a little dirty. I came in with a coupon they sent to me via email for a free regular sub and when I have it to the cashier they told me they do not take copies of coupons so I told him it was a print out from something they sent me and caused a whole sick about it. So I asked him how would you like for me to give you an email without printing it out and he just stood there and looked at me. Finally another employee told him just to take it. Then he asked me to show him my ID. I did not have my wallet with me only cash and credit cards so I showed him a picture of me on the back of my AMEX card. Same thing he stood there staring at me then finally another employee said enough this guy is good. What's the point of sending out something to bring you in to try their food when they hassle you about doing it. Get a better system guys plus the ice machine has black mold on it which is disgusting considering every drink you fill is contaminated. I even brought it to the attention of the manager and she did nothing."}
{"text":"It is your typical Jersey Mikes. I like the turkey club and the number 13. Get it Mike's Way"}
{"text":"I love jersey mikes so much more than subway. I don't think I can ever eat subway again. The prices are a little higher but worth the money and you can add avocado to any sub with no extra cost."}
{"text":"I love there roast beef. Employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"May have chosen the wrong food. They may want to take the cheesesteak of the menu. If you are a Philly or Jersey native it will be an absolute disappointment, perhaps it is the bread or just the employees not knowing how to make a proper cheesesteak. I will wait to get back to Philly to get my next cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Visited this location last night with my 10 year old. We had never been in a Jersey Mike's so we were up to try it. The subs were ok, nothing to write home about. The bigger issue was the soda machine and customer service. When my daughter went to fill her soda, she chose Sprite/Sierra Mist, the cup was filled with a clear liquid AND hundreds of ants! We took the cup to the cash register where we stood for over 7 minutes because the associates were in the back. Once the young man came out we showed him what was in the cup and he was also grossed out. He stated he would go clean the soda machine. Never once did we see anyone go clean the machine. We opted for a bottled drink instead. We ate our food and watched 4 other customers fill up their drinks from the ant infested soda machine. They all got dark sodas so I am sure they did not see the ants and continued drinking. This is a problem Jersey Mike's! Gross and I will never go back to one of your establishments."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the service, Mike's way is the only way for me.   This location often runs out of bread, however, and the cooked-in-house roast beef is inconsistently really good or really dry (overcooked)."}
{"text":"Just left there and the guy took my money with gloves on and went back without changing them and fixed a sandwich.. not sure his name but he is a tall white guy with a beard ... so beware ."}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mike's but this particular location lacks consistency. I've eaten there about six times since they opened and it's definitely hit or miss. Always new staff when we go in so I'm thinking maybe a lot of turnover. Last night I ordered the Cancro and the roast beef was little tiny shavings of the very end of the roast. Over cooked, dried out and very sparse. We will drive down to the one on Dysart going forward as they are very consistent and always excellent. It's too bad because we live really close to the one on McDowell but I want to know that it's going to be good, not just toss a coin and hope for the best."}
{"text":"This sandwich place is so consistent and very pleasant! Love Jersey Mike's and their staff here!"}
{"text":"Tuna subs are one of my favorite foods and I'm always on a search for my new favorite (since Firehouse discontinued Tuna and DiBellas changed their tuna recipe that is basically just mayo with a little tuna). I stopped at Jersey Mike's the other day and ordered the regular size done \"Mike's way\" with Onions, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Red Wine Vinegar, Olive Oil Blend, Oregano, Salt...they asked about cheese and I chose provolone which was freshly sliced when I ordered it which is different that the cheese and meat is sliced fresh. I ordered a small drink and my total was over $10 which I thought was a mistake. Nope, they charge an extra $1 for cheese (not extra cheese, just a normal amount of a few slices of cheese). The regular size is maybe 8\" long and not stuffed like some sub shops do (there were 2 slices of tomato and so little onion I could barely notice it). I love oregano & vinegar on subs so it was really good but overpriced for what you get, a large at DiBellas that is double the size is only a dollar or two more.  Ehhhh, if I had a coupon I might go back because it was a good sub but I will not return at full price."}
{"text":"First time ever to a Jersey Mike's and it was pretty good! I tried their Philly cheesesteak, cause I have it everywhere it's offered. It was pretty decent. Better than most places that don't specialize in it. Location was clean and staff was friendly enough. Probably be back."}
{"text":"Nice job Jersey  Mike's.! Always a good sandwich with friendly service."}
{"text":"Unless the lady Manager is there expect your sandwich to be wrong.  I called in to have it ready when we picked up only to find that they never started it.  Apparently they guy took my order down wrong and the manager had to correct it.  Unfortunately she had to take care of another helpless staff member so my husband ended up with a completely different sub than he ordered.  The subs were fine but of the two times I have been to this location in the last week it's clear there is only one person who knows what to do!  I seriously hope they are paying the manager big bucks because she is running the shop and having to do everyone's job for them!"}
{"text":"Ive had Jersey Mikes when I lived in DC and I thought it was a lot better.  Could've just been the guy who was making it at the time but overall price vs. quality for a sub...I think I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Prices may seem high but the sandwiches are huge. Despite that, I didn't care for them. They have more cold sandwiches than hot (no indication can make a cold one hot) and I didn't like the cold one. It was too cold, if that makes sense. You can have it Mike's Way which makes it easier with toppings though far less choices there - no red onions, they have white only. Sauces also extremely limited. One measly slice of bacon on my sandwich as well - sure I got a Mini, but one slice only went down the middle - not enough coverage. I may try it one more time just to see if things improve with a hot sandwich, but not impressed with first visit."}
{"text":"Jersey Mikes is awesome and delicious.  This location donated sandwiches for our State Farm blood drive at Kate Lowe's State Farm.  We thank them for their kindness and generosity."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite sub place. Whatever you do, make sure you get your sandwich \"Mike's Way.\" It is amazing and tops Jimmy Johns and Subway in my book, hands down. The staff has always been very friendly as well whenever I have been in here."}
{"text":"Four stars for a chain!?  Well yes, if the staff is well trained, knowledgeable and friendly.  This was my first time entering a Jersey Mike's Subs, as far as I know we do not have one in the Bay Area.  I believe that the young man who helped me out told me his name was Javier.  If not, I will describe him.  He was young and attentive, possibly of Latin origin, and looked like he enjoyed sandwiches.  Now that final description was actually confirmed by \"Javier\" when he told me that he had started his work shift with the club sub.  He explained \"Mikes Way\" to me and made my first overall experience with this chain a pleasurable one.  I was especially pleased that one can order a mini version of the sandwiches.  For those times when one is hungry, but only enough for a sub-sub.  Ha Ha!  I said sub-sub!  Hilarious."}
{"text":"Wow!  I had came in yesterday after a long morning. The staff here was so friendly to me and my daughter. They asked me about my day and even offered her some pickles while we were getting out sub made. She loves pickles! While eating I spilled an entire water bottle! I was so embarrassed and I felt terrible. Estabon came over right away to mop it up. I kept thanking him and apologized but he was so polite about it, it made me not feel like such an ass.  He even offered to refill my water bottle and bring my daughter a cookie! Wow. I can't believe how nice he was.  The service here is way beyond average. I will definitely be back.   The sub was great too!"}
{"text":"Had this place tonight for dinner. First time here. Cool little place, nothin over spectacular, but a decent looking place.   Service was great, not \"Jimmy John's\" fast, but not \"restaurant slow. About $7-$8 for a regular sub. Filled me up, that says a lot considering in an eat a big portion. Good amount of meat, not that super thick bread like other places.   I ordered the Big Kahuna, Philly cheesesteak style hot sub. Pretty good, never been to Philly to know what a \"real\" Philly cheesesteak taste like, but for a franchise sandwich shop, pretty good.   I would recommend this to ppl, something different than the norm. Average price, and fills you up."}
{"text":"If you want a great club sandwich this is the place to go. Only been in once and the service was great and I got lots of smiles while they ask me how my day was which was pleasant. I got extra meat, mikes way that come with tomato's, onions, lettuce and vinegar. Mmmmhmmm! They do have a TV in the shop with ESPN on so you can grab a bite and watch the game all at the same time - what's not to love."}
{"text":"Always a great sub and great staff. They are very nice and approachable every time I walk in. Plus the food is fresh and tastes amazing."}
{"text":"I should've gave up on the store along time ago... After four wrong orders in a row the general manager assured me that he made my sandwich himself and that it would be right and guaranteed me any order after this one would be right from now on... Well guess what I should've checked it before I left it was wrong! It may seem like a small thing but I got jalapeños instead of banana peppers on the side. It was written in the online order twice and still wrong. Like I said this was the fourth time in a row my order was wrong. I'm done with this store"}
{"text":"First time here and I was ignored and the person making my sub went to the back to talk without even finishing my sandwich. And I was told by the cashier sorry we have to talk the employees that are leaving instead of doing our job. And the start eating the sandwich and they is a hair in it that is not mine. So grossed out and then find out they will not refund the money. This place is horrible"}
{"text":"I came into this location on what would seem to be a slow time on a weekday. I was the only guest in line with 2 others sharing a table in the dining room. Upon chit chatting with the 2 very nice and inviting employees (Chad and Justin) I ordered and promptly received my sandwich. While enjoying it's deliciousness, a rush came through the door. This rush of 9 guests standing in line would seem to me to fluster anyone, but these 2 handled it extremely well and professionally. I was quite impressed with the professionalism, speed, and customer interaction from these 2, also from the cleanliness, order of store (drinks in case, chips stocked, etc), and overall experience... I will frequent this location because of their hospitality and professionalism. It's an added bonus that it's in the same shopping center which I work."}
{"text":"Not happy whatsoever. I came in and spent $14 on one giant turkey/provolone sub, and they put wilted, wet lettuce from the bottom of the container onto my sandwich. By the time I opened my sandwich, both buns were completely soaked by the lettuce. Disgusting. Refill your containers with fresh lettuce so customers can actually get what they pay for."}
{"text":"Slow service and super rude. Never will go again. Lady making sandwiches was rude. And slow workers standing around not do anything while customers wait. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is fresh and yummy! The staff is always friendly and kind to us. We come here about once a week."}
{"text":"I ordered The Club. At every other Jersey Mike's that I visit, they grill the sub for me to toast the bread and melt the cheese but they refused here stating that they can't grill cold subs. WHY would you refuse if the customer is asking for this. I doubt it'll somehow harm the grill. Then as I was telling the girl fixing my sub what i'd like in the order I liked, for example, \"I'd like my bacon on top of my ham & turkey\", she said \"we put the bacon on the bread\". If I tell you i'd like my bacon on next, why would you think it mattered when you want to put it on?? My experience was annoying and I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"First of all, this certain Goodyear jersey mikes location I'm very fond of. I go in at least 3 times a week and I've been to other locations as well, but I won't go back and will go the extra distance to this Goodyear location. As I walk in. I am constantly greeted by an amazing and optimistic staff. You guys did a great job hiring a great staff that know how to make a mean sand which! Especially Kyle, Brandon , Corey when he was there , and a few other that I feel bad I haven't mentioned .  But especially when it comes to A++ service and delivering my sub right, I will literally walk in and Kyle or Brandon will know our orders since we came in constantly and have it handled.  EVERYTIME they continue to give me the best service, attitude, and delivery when I come in! Please don't disappoint me Goodyear jersey mikes and don't fix what's not broken.  Your staff that I mentioned and the delivery of your food I am very optimistic and grateful for. And I want to thank your STAFF (Kyle, Brandon, and a few others that have been there for a while) for constantly killing it at there job and making me personally the best **** sub I've had at ANY jersey mikes location! Thank you for your time reading this Goodyear jersey mikes location !  From a regular customer (sometimes a giant) xD"}
{"text":"Being creatures of convenience, I used to go to Jersey Mike's in my office building ALL THE TIME.  I like how you can get hot or cold sandwiches... but I think all the other sandwich chain stores offer that now, but JM's clearly was a pioneer in that accord.  This location off of East Blvd is one I drive by all the time, but I never stop into.  It has its own parking lot (shared with the next door pharmacy) so parking should not be an issue.  There's a potential problem of people parking here for the other businesses across the street, but I don't see the JM's employees sitting out there and calling tow trucks to make someone's day pretty krappy.  Anyways - large dining area of tables, friendly staff, and I've never really run into a long line here.  If anything, the line will move pretty fast.  Here's where I will interject my two cents regarding cheese-steaks:  yes the offer one here.  Is it the best?  No.. but it's decent and for all you die-hard Philly Cheesesteak people... this is Charlotte, not Philly... I have yet to find a place in Charlotte that blows me away with their cheesesteak, but the quest must go on!  JM's does really kill it with advertising and marketing, but they do do a solid job.  I know this location has been open for a while, so hopefully it stays that way.  I need to do my part in making this place a regular visit in my weekly much spots."}
{"text":"Standard Jersey Mike's Chain store.    I was the only customer on a weeknight and the people were super nice.  They even brought my sandwich to me when it was ready.  It was to go, so I got home and happily scarfed the sandwich down in a couple of minutes.  The cool thing I found on this visit was that they had a little touch screen computer near the register where you can \"check-in\" as a frequent customer using your cell phone and they send you coupons and offers via text messaging.  You redeem the coupons on that little touch screen input device."}
{"text":"This store recently opened in part of the old Blockbuster store.  It shares a space with a yogurt/cupcake place.   The store is laid out a little differently than most Jersey Mike's. Tables are to the left.  You place your order the back right and then work your way forward.  Typically, most JM's work the other way around, at least the ones I've been to.  Also, the grill for this location is right behind the main counter whereas other locations has it in a back room so it seems space could be tight behind the counter.  I went with the #13 which is a typical Italian.  It seems this location is following the trend of other sub places and slicing meat as thin as possilble and loading the sandwhich with lettuce instead.  Meat seems to be scarce these days.  And $14 for a large sub?  Ouch.  Maybe it would have been worth it if they gave me more meat.  But it's a Jersey Mike's.  Subs are usually good here and in this area, I am still glad to see them open."}
{"text":"I don't normally come down here on my lunch hour but was in the area and decided to stop at Stonecrest for something quick.  LOL.  Then I realized there are no quick options for lunch at Stonecrest.   The line at Wendy's was outside of the parking lot.  The line at Smashburger was to the door.  So I came here, knowing that they make things quickly and I can get everything to go and eat at my desk at the office.  Well first thing is there was a line here as well.  And you had to wait to get to the counter to decide on your order because the menu options are not visible from the line that forms along the left side of the restaurant.  And I didn't see any printed menus to browse before I reached the counter.  I could have already decided if there was a menu on the wall or facing the front of the restaurant.  The ordering process is easy after you can see the menu options.  Similar to a Lennys.  They slice the meat and cheese as you wait in line then your sandwich moves down the line for the toppings.  My hopes of getting out quick faded when the toppings guy decided to flirt with the two women behind me and as he was working on all sandwiches, mine got the least attention.  Yes, they use big (and i do mean big) slices of tomatoes, they stuff their sandwiches (unlike Jimmy Johns) but they could have stuffed mine a little faster.  Then I get to the register to checkout and there's no one there.  The guy is contantly checking on something in the back.   But as always, Jersey Mikes delivers on taste and the bang for the buck.  So For service, I give this experience a 2. For Taste, they get a 4.  Averages out to a 3 for this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is only my third experience with this location (or jersey mikes in general) each time we have gone in we get something different, it's always been a pleasant experience with their chicken cheese steak the turkey on white or their buffalo chicken wrap. They have a little bit of everything but by far the best part of this location is how great the customer service is each and every time I go in without a doubt."}
{"text":"Great staff, but the sandwiches I got were flavorless and bread was a bit dry and the meat had no \"umph\"."}
{"text":"Fresh & delicious subs! Perfect for the working man who doesn't want to eat something too heavy"}
{"text":"Not really happy with this place. My fiance and I just went in a little bit ago and order ourself to subs for dinner and the guy working was extremely rude. He used one word to ask me what bread I wanted kicked the little swinging door open to go get it, and when my sub was done used one word and walked away. All the this could have been ignored if he hadn't been staring me and my fiance down while we left and he was sweeping. Won't be going back, this town is filled with places that will be more than happy to provide us with service and appreciate our money."}
{"text":"Awful service, awful food, awful staff. I love other locations however they have never been able to get it together here. The staff is too young and untrained."}
{"text":"Here's the thing....this place gets one star not necessarily because it tastes horrible.  The subs for the most part are pretty good...but 15 bucks for a sub is ridiculous.  Not to mention the fact that they give you the least amount of meat than I've ever seen....and for 15 bucks to get a bare minimum sandwich is ridiculous.  One star is all I can muster for this place."}
{"text":"Introduced a colleague to the wonderful world of Jersey Mike's today. You can only eat Subway so many times before needing something substantially better, in my opinion, and JM fits the bill!!  I had the Chipotle Chicken Philly and it was delicious!! The bread alone is worth the price of the sandwich, and I love the style of sliced Philly-style chicken that they use.   They deliver, as well,  and our meal arrived hot and on-time."}
{"text":"When I was working everybody would go on about Jeresy Mike's subs.  \"Mike's Way\" they would say.  When I retired there was not one close to my home base.  So, out here in Laveen visiting the son we get some Subs.  My basic opinion is they are your basic sub.  The bread is hard white Italian bread and the toppings seemed your basic fare.  The ingredients seemed fresh and the pepper was a nice touch.  The meat was not too plentiful (turkey) but thankfully not too salty.  The cheese was very good and the light dressing is a pleasant change.  However, they are not the cheapest sandwiches around and they are not much better (IMO) than other chain submarine sandwiches and certainly not better than the many local sandwich shops.  You know what you are getting and it's OK."}
{"text":"An amazing SUB EXPERIENCE for me.  I'm out here for work and am glad that I had the opportunity to chow down here for lunch.  The menu is really simple... a total of about 10 subs that encompass a wide array of hot and cold specialties.  I ordered a Giant-sized Roast Beef (It looks to be about a foot and a half long).  Now, this is how roast beef should be... a prime slab that is carved right in front of you, layered on top of your sub and made through the assembly line.  The ingredients are fresh and the sub tastes about 5 times better than the Subways and Quiznos that plague Southern California... the beef was flavorful, perfectly cooled, and was accompanied masterfully by the simplest but freshest of tomatoes, lettuce and onions. I asked them to perfectly entrenched my sub w/ mayo for a mouth watering experience.  EACH BITE WAS PERFECT.  The staff was great... anytime I'm in Cleveland I'm greeted w/ great hospitality--Mike's is NO exception.  I couldn't finish the sub and was greeted by a server with a bag and a playful comment, \"Couldn't finish it, eh?\" (when was the last time somebody at Subway offered to do ANYTHING for you?)  I definitely couldn't finish the sub but I sure can give this place 5 STRONG STARS.  I will definitely visit their opening locations in California and try the entire selection ASAP."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are always wonderful. Staff is friendly and usually remembers your order if you stop frequently"}
{"text":"A friend and I walked into Jersey Mikes during slow hours and the two employees were sitting down at a table, which was fine because no one was in the store so I understand. That wasn't the problem, once we walked in the gentleman jumped up and helped us. Another person walked in when we were still deciding and the female worker still sat there on her phone playing a game. The gentleman was very helpful but messed up our order because he was trying to get through the customers in line while the female sat there occasionally looking at us, well aware there were customers waiting. After we realized our sandwiches were wrong we decided to just eat them because we also work in the food industry and realize that it can be annoying. I went back to purchase another sandwich and the two were talking across the line to each other about personal things. Disappointed with the service here."}
{"text":"Get the Philly.Get the Philly. Get the Philly. Don't mess with the other mediocre subs. The cheesesteak is ridiculous and somehow the best in the valley."}
{"text":"You pay wth a card and it forces you to tip. I think that is bogus for a fast food sandwich shop. I am not a fan of supplementing employers wages by forcing a consumer to \"tip\" your employee. Sandwich that I ordered was soggy and gross. No thanks."}
{"text":"I have a 19 month old and a 4 year old-my 4 year old son nurses for 23 months and I lost my weight in no time-didn't get fat everywhere either. So my daughter made me HUGE (and I've always been tiny) and made it hard to lose weight nursing as I was starved all the time.   Ok so I'm on my own version of a ketone diet: 0 sugar, 0 Carbs-EVER. I should cut out dairy but I need something so cheese is ok. Steak and cheese no bread or onions or peppers is my \"indulgence\". I've been all over, Subway (DISGUSTING) Firehouse (not enough) and the GIANT at Jersey Mike's-MMMMM. I can say it was lovely to indulge in and was enough to fill me and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Love the subs ..my favorite is the Philly cheesesteak..love the staff everybody is always so nice to me ."}
{"text":"Food is good, but since they slice and then make each sandwich to order, be ready to wait.  If you're on a short lunch...go elsewhere  Wife ordered a steak sandwich with peppers, onions and mushrooms.  The combination made the sandwich like a bowl of soup."}
{"text":"I really like there Big Kahuna sandwich. However, I usually get the jalapenos on the side, so they don't overpower the sandwich.  I also am a fan of their email club and enjoy the free sandwich on the day of your birthday.  Those things make me rate the chain of Jersey Mikes with 4 Stars. However, this location lost a star for the following reason. They close at 10pm, but DON'T go after 9:30 hoping for one of their signature hot, cheesesteak sandwiches.  Tonight, for the second time, I arrived about 9:40 and the grill was obviously cleaned for the night. Frustrating, when they claimed each time that it was an exception and usually the grill is not cleaned until after 9:45. I will buy that line one, but not twice."}
{"text":"I will only visit Jersey Mike's for my birthday from now on. I use to love to come to this location where most of the people from the Central and Camelback store transferred but not anymore. There are a bunch of rude, and aggressive workers that don't know what they are doing. I will never pay to eat here again and will only go for my yearly free sub."}
{"text":"The guys that work here, always remember my name and order. They are awesome. Plus the food is good. Good subs at a good price."}
{"text":"Jersey Mike's is probably the closest you will get in AZ to a hero from back east. We just do not have good bread or deli sandwiches/heroes here. It used to be at Hero Hut in downtown Phoenix but they went out of business this year. Besides Cassella's in Scottsdale this is the best I have found so far living here for 30 plus years."}
{"text":"My first visit to a Jersey Mike's Subs and I am not sure if I am entirely sure if I like it or not. The sandwich was decent, just ok. The service was nice enough and basic for a sandwich joint.   The parking lot is small and they share it with a Starbucks, so it gets pretty crowded during peak times."}
{"text":"Have tried a couple times, tuna was so disgusting, couldn't even recognize that it was tuna. Bread tasted weird. Not sure if the girls working today weren't hand eking the food correctly because everything we ordered had a very off taste. Waste of money"}
{"text":"Number 9 Mikes Way...except hold the onions.  A great option among all the others near the North Lake Mall. Fast and friendly service too. Reasonable prices and many great options."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times as this is my \"go-to-spot\" while waiting to meet people from Craigslist to buy or sell something from people around Tempe.    I love the way they slice all the ingredients, the meats and the cheese right on the spot according to the sandwich you order.    They also hot sandwiches here and they don't nuke them in microwaves like they do at subway.  They have a grill!  Jersey Mike's is no-brainer over Subway any day!"}
{"text":"Got turned on to Jersey Mikes while in Atlanta visiting my nephew a few years ago when I used to live in Florida.  They hit the mark with everything from the quality of the meat to the quality of the bread.  Cold subs, hot subs, have had them all and enjoyed them immensely.    My favorites are a tie between the Club and the Roast Beef.  Both are delish and \"Mikes Way\" is certainly the classic way to eat a sub with lettuce, onions, tomato, oil and vinegar, salt and pepper and oregano.  I add a little mayo and yes, life is good.  Was pleased to see they were in Charlotte when we moved here and in fact, it was one of the first meals we ate in the city on a break from a morning of house hunting.  Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"This Jersey Mike's kicks ass!!! The staff is always friendly. Tuesday luncheon is chaos but they people there get you out of there in no time. The #9 cold sub is a steal and their relish has the perfect balance of acidity and sweetness."}
{"text":"Always have delicious sandwiches and super friendly service! My favorite is the buffalo chicken wrap with ranch dressing instead of blue cheese dressing. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I love Jersey Mikes! Great quality meat and fresh toppings made the way you like it. I crave their sandwiches and eat here all the time. The bread is moist and perfect ratios on the sandwich, so perfectly filling. The staff is awesome and I look forward to my next visit. I may go there tomorrow in fact! Also, I ordered a tray on super short notice for a wedding getting ready meal. The staff made it happen and everyone at the party kept asking where they were from- it was that good!"}
{"text":"I live one mile from here & was so excited when it opened. I have been there about a dozen times. I LOVE the sandwiches. The service is lousy! They need to get their act together or they won't last long. EVERY time I have been there, they get something wrong. The last several times I have ordered a Mini #8 Club. Each time when I go to pay, they have given me the Regular. When I tell them that I ordered the Mini, they change the ticket & charge me for the Mini. They are loosing money every time. Today they forgot to put the bacon on the club. Fortunately I caught it before I left the building. The lady in front of me had already paid & the guy tried to charge her again. The guy behind me ordered wheat bread & got white. They gave me a regular AGAIN today, when I had ordered a Mini. I don't know if this is some scam they are running to increase their income.........a lot of people may not even notice that they gave them a regular & just pay the higher price & go on. I think I'm going to see what the Attorney General's office says about this. Come on guys, this is not rocket science, it's subs!"}
{"text":"I love this place. We eat here as a Sunday ritual. The loss of 2 stars is due to the fact that they are SOOO EXPENSIVE! !"}
{"text":"Walked in at just before 915pm when they close at 10pm. Tried to order a hot sub and the guy working told me that it was going to be 20-30 minutes for any hot sub because they'd have to turn back on the grill and they already cleaned it. He seemed annoyed but there was 45 freaking minutes left before they closed. I have worked in food service long enough to know that's not exactly the best customer service. It also eliminates half of what we could order and made me cranky."}
{"text":"Just are here the sub was pretty decent I had a number 3 Mike's way on white. The resteraunt cleanliness was very poor. Literally every table in the dining room was dirty. The floors were gross. I would not return to this location."}
{"text":"Im not a very \"subbie\" kind of person to begin with, but I do enjoy a good sub every now & then. I mainly go to Subway (of course) or Bite Me Subs for the most part. I had my hopes high as I walked into Jersey Mike's subs, and those high hopes were not met. I felt as though their subs were very bland & overpriced for a sandwich you could make better in the comfort of your own kitchen. They have just a little more variety than a Subway, but once again not very flavorful. Service was great though & the workers were helpful. Unsure if I'll be back though."}
{"text":"I like the sandwiches usually but one guy there constantly puts mayo on my sub. I hate mayo and never ask for it. It sucks when you get home and mayo is all over my sandwich. I guess I'll have to be creepy and just stare at them make my food. NO MAYO!!!"}
