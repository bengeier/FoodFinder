{"text":"Wife had the veggie burger said it was very good. I really liked the pizza crust. The sauce was a little sweet for me but still very good. I would order again."}
{"text":"Just finished a half sheet from moma Lola. It was some of the finest pizza I've had in the area and I've lived here 25 years. This is my new pizza joint for any occasion I may have. Also props on free delivery. 


Also ordered the meat ball sub, Italian sausage sub, Hawaiian pizza and fried raviolis a few weeks ago. All were very delicious and I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"They post their close time. Cool. I call no later than 1/2 hour before close and EVERYTIME they tell me that they are closed. WTF?!? If you don't want to stay open til a certain time, then don't. Please keep your hours of operations current. You have great pizza but if you can't provide service during the times you set, then change your closing times."}
{"text":"Just ordered the Daveas meatball sub. This is one of my favorite places for delivery  because they are fast and the food is always hot."}
{"text":"This pizza was delicious. The cheese was perfect and it's not even it's speciality. I hear their sausage and meatballs are unreal. Yum."}
{"text":"We decided to give Mama Lola's a try at work yesterday after getting Angelo's too many times. The crust was fresh and not greasy, and the veggie pizza had some awesome toppings. I'm definitely going to give this place another order."}
{"text":"Nothing but crust and a lil bit of sauce on that pizza. Was average tasting and nothing special."}
{"text":"Delivery is super fast! Pizza was okay, not awful but not the best. However, the Mozzarella sticks were amazing!"}
{"text":"Had a small snafu with pricing, hung up. The manager called me back and made it right and threw in a bonus. Pizza was piping hot on arrival, pepperoni was crisp, cheese was plentiful, sauced just right maid I mention, free delivery.  Would order again."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered pizza at Mama Lola's, I got a veggie pizza to share with friends. After eating the first bite, I could tell something was wrong. The pizza was so under cooked that it was basically inedible. My friends and I ate some of it anyways but felt a bit sick afterwards. I decided to give Mama Lola's a second try just the other day. I ordered a Veggie Pizza with no cheese for myself, a dish of pesto pasta for my boyfriend, and an order of falafel to share. It didn't even cross my mind that the pizza may be under cooked again. As i took the first bite, the crust was soggy and the dough still under cooked. This time, instead of suffering through it, I put the pizza into my oven until it was cooked through. The outside of the falafel was burnt and the inside completely flavorless. The pesto pasta came in one clump of noodles stuck together with a large clump of pesto sitting on top. The staff was very friendly and the order was finished quickly, but overall my experience with Mama Lola's has been very negative."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I've had in lakewood. I've gone to Angelos and others which are good, but Mama Lolas is always my go to.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"As a former Tremont resident I wasn't sure if I could find pizza as good as my beloved Edison's. Then, thanks to Yelp, I found Angelos. I still love both, but a few days ago I discovered this place (thanks again, Yelp). Oh my goodness, it was fantastic. I really wasn't expecting pizza this good. I got their Cabo pizza and it was perfect. Extra virgin olive oil, roasted garlic, fresh mozzarella, pineapple, red onion, & tomato is an interesting, yet incredibly delicious combination. Definitely my new favorite!"}
{"text":"I ordered a meat lover's pizza and couldn't have been more impressed. Don't let the plaza store front deceive you! The owner was there and was extremely patient while I decided what to order. Move over Angelo's! There's a new joint in town!"}
{"text":"After ordering their ribs and being less than impressed, we thought we would give them a second chance and try the pizza. We placed our order via GrubHub and awaited its arrival. 

Boy, were we pleasantly surprised!

We had the Wonton Wrappers and the Confucius Pizza. The Wonton Wrappers were filled with cream cheese & jalapeño peppers. It was like a jalapeño popper, but better. I wanted more. 

The Confucius Pizza has a Thai Sweet Chile Sauce, Panko Shrimp and loads of delicious cheese. My wife & I made quick work of the large pie...and I think it could very well become our go-to pizza. 

We will definitely order again. Thanks, Mama Lola's!"}
{"text":"I love Mama Lola's. Probably order from them once a week it seems. The pizza is really good, along with their pulled chicken sandwich and Italian sub. I'd give them 5 stars except you don't always know what appetizers you are going to get. It seems the fried cheddar is now regular mozzarella sticks, and sometimes the jalapeno wontons come as poppers (which are still good, btw). Service is always great, the delivery people are extremely prompt and nice."}
{"text":"I really love this place! We tried them when they first opened and it needed some work but they definitely stepped up! The sausage is some of the best in town and the specialty pizzas are all really good. I would also like to  say the service has always been great!"}
{"text":"Sauce is amazing, prepared perfect and was still that way when delivered!  Crust is crispy yet soft. Not as greasy as most places around. YUM!!! So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"I wish I could get a pizza with fresh mushrooms in this area. I got a white pizza that had almost no flavor. The crust was a little too thick and it would seem that someone left out the salt, but it it did have a good texture for being so thick. The cheese pizza was nice even if the sauce was a bit sweet. For the amount of money spent I was unhappy. This was my second time ordering from them and I doubt there will be a third I am sad to say. The delivery people are very nice."}
{"text":"Mama Lola's is AMAZING! Recently ordered for a 4 year olds birthday party. Everyone from the littlest of kids to the grandparents loved Mama Lola's pizza. I placed the order a day in advance for 3 sheet pizzas to be delivered at noon on a Saturday. Literally at 11:59 the pizzas arrived. I was beyond impressed all around."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place went so down hill.  Ordered a pizza and two sides and a salad at 7pm on a Friday evening.  Ordered the godfather pizza.  Asked for a well done bake.  Pizza arrived soggy, yes soggy. Too much sauce. The cheese was well done but the rest of the pizza was thrown together and under cooked, did i mention soggy?  Could not even pick up a slice to eat.  Also got a side of poppers and moz sticks, both arrived without dipping sauce.  Oh, and the salad did not arrive, called about that and the salad was delivered minutes later missing cheese.  what a disaster. Have had ok experiences with this place before, but, this was unacceptable on all fronts. Will not be back. Did I mention the pizza was almost $25?"}
{"text":"Been getting pizza here for a while, and I honestly have to say, this is the best pizza in Cleveland. 

First tried it because we were at a bar in Lakewood that had no food, they delivered to the bar. Excellent choice. Gotten it probably eight or ten times since then. It's always consistently great. Crust is buttery, cheese is browned just the right amount, sauce is slightly sweet, but not overwhelming so.

Also, they'll deliver a veggie burger. Not a lot of places around here will do that.

A couple of the sides seemed a little small, especially for the price, but the pizza is so great I'm not going to knock off a star for that."}
{"text":"Fucking amazing.  I've heard from Lakewood locals that they didn't like it as much but told them to try it again (apparently it's better now).  They loved it just as much as I did.  I've had pizza in Napoli (Italy), at the first pizzeria in New York City, and at some other amazing place in St. Louis that I can't remember the name of, unfortunately.  This is better than all of those places, in terms of quality ingredients.  By far, the best pizza I've ever had.  Since others have said it was hit or miss in the past, I hope they keep it up!  As of right now, it's absolutely amazing.  Would recommend reading the Specialty Pizza Menu on their website, like I did."}
{"text":"First of all, we tried this place because I had an Entertainment coupon & was nearby. Usually, when I call a place & tell them I have a coupon, they skimp on toppings & we end up never returning. Not the case here. Their veggie pizza was loaded with toppings, including artichoke hearts & sun-dried tomatoes. Their sauce was good & cheese & veggies were generous. If I had only one complaint, it would be that the mushrooms were not fresh, probably canned. Fresh would've been much better, but maybe that's all that was available at the time. Overall, a good pizza"}
{"text":"Their pizza is great and reasonably priced. The deluxe is by far my favorite. The service is prompt and polite."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. They're super nice and close to my house. And I feel like they're onto something great but just drop the ball sometimes. I mean garlic bread on a hot dog bun? You're a pizza joint. You gotta have fresh dough around there somewhere!"}
{"text":"We have been making an effort to try new places in the area, and this had decent reviews on Yelp; perfect scenario, right?? This place has online ordering which is a plus for me because you can actually type in whatever you want and don't have to worry about someone writing it down (I added broccoli to the penne with alfredo sauce and mayo to a sub). At least, this is typically a positive aspect for me; I didn't get broccoli or mayo... Anyway, it said 45-60 minutes for delivery; it took 65 and the driver called and made us go out to get it rather than bringing it to our apartment. The alfredo sauce was bland and probably would have been better straight out of a Great Value jar. One star only for the ease of online ordering and for the garlic bread. One star for being so terrible that I felt a Yelp review was necessary. Big thumbs down, Lakewood- beware."}
{"text":"This place is under estimated!!! Excellent pizza and up there with the finest in Cleveland!! Fresh pizza dough and heats up the next day like a gourmet Italian meal!!....hummmm...best in Lakewood?? I think its in the top 2! At number 1 for me!!"}
{"text":"Tonight is a busy, rainy, Saturday night. I don't order pizza often, but after a long road trip day to ikea and back, pizza was pretty necessary. I called Mama Lola's at a few minutes before 8:00 while driving back home into Lakewood, ordered a pizza and a salad, and had a delivery guy at my door at 8:24. Less than a half hour for pizza on a night like tonight is kinda magic. And not just any run of the mill pizza either. Mama Lola's has that thick crust and cheesy cheesiness that you dream about. And don't even start me on the salad. Their side salad is loaded with toppings and pretty much meal-sized (pro-tip: ranch dressing).

Yum!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a local pizza place to support instead of your basic frozen pizza dough chain restaurant. I randomly picked Mama Lola's a few months ago & now I order it quite a bit.

I usually order a salami pizza and fried ravioli. They have a great selection of pizza toppings. I have also had the burger (thin, frozen patty - not good), wings, fried Oreos, Mac & Cheese bites (my fave) and a few other things. I've received the wrong food a few times & they came back with the correct items. They have a huge variety of options.. Ribs, salads, sandwiches etc. I've never had terrible food from here but I'm not a fan of the frozen / not fresh items. It's a good option if you want delivery but not pizza. 

Edit: I don't even know if they're open anymore because anytime I go to order from them, GrubHub says they're closed. I used to order once a week at least & I haven't had it in months."}
{"text":"I had never tried Mama Lolas before so I got a few different things. Nothing was really all that good.  The chicken tenders are frozen processed compressed chicken. Tasted like rubber, inedible. The fried oreos tasted like burnt chocolate. The pizza was alright. Mediocre. I also got the mac and cheese bites and they were alright but I've had way better pretty much everywhere else ive had them. And lastly I got garlic parm wings which were equally as disappointing. I ordered extra crispy but they were slimy and gross. Wasted 10 bucks in them because I couldn't even eat them. The sauce was alright but not much parm to it. Pretty much just butter. Overall I feel as though I wasted my money because I wasn't pleased with anything I ordered. The staff and customer service was great though.  It's not the staff, it's entirely the food that is just plain disgusting."}
{"text":"First time ordering tonight.  Exactly what we were looking for.  Wings were descent size,  ordered well,  and they were.  Pizza was huge (got a large 3 topping,  the special was 14.99 totally affordable) cheese was good.  Sausage wasnt spicy, and just basic pepperoni. Extra cheese, and believe me there was!  Delivery guy was nice.  All and all I think I found my new go to,  when looking for mom and pop pizza shop pizza. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try the other night. The large veggie I got was well put together, I'll give them that; the toppings and cheese were generously and evenly distributed, as they should be, but the crust and sauce were just not good. The crust was chewy and tasted kind of stale, and the sauce just tasted \"off\"; not fresh at all. I would still give them a try if I were you, because there seem to be a few good reviews on here, which makes me think that I just got unlucky with some old dough/sauce. I've worked for a few pizza places before, and I can tell you from experience, almost every single pizza place will occasionally dish out a pizza made with dough/sauce that is a little too old (starting to go bad). There's no danger, because the heat kills any harmful bacteria, but it just tastes kind of off. I have a feeling this is what happened to me. I think the best bet here is to give em a shot and see for yourself; mistakes are bound to happen occasionally at every pizza place, especially when they're new on the block like Mama Lola's is."}
{"text":"Fast and awesome, the salads are huge and amazing. The workers are super cool and try to cater to your every need ! Definitely recommend for that quick delicious meal !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Love their crust and sauce! They also have delicious mozzarella sticks, garlic bread with cheese, and the Oreo bites are to die for. Combine the food with their top-notch customer service and you can't go wrong!"}
