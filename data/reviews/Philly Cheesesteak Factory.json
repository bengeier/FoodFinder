{"text":"I work close to this place, our boss buys us lunch once a month. We always choose to order here. Burger great but philly cheese is the BOMB. I have lived  in LV for 37 years and have tried  most phillys all around LV. and this is the best by far.  So its in a gas station so what? A sonic is next door so eat there if you want."}
{"text":"Bring your own salt....I had asked for more salt (inspired by one review here), but I still could barely taste any, could be because the mid-low quality cheese over powered the beef a lot. The bread is of mid-low quality, too. Since the beef is fresh and steamy hot/warm and I love juicy and freshly cooked beef, so it's a 3-star. Hot wings are pretty good, great value, $4 for 8 pieces. But overall, not repeatable, not worth the drive."}
{"text":"First and foremost, dont judge the place by the look...its inside a gas station, so it leaves very little to be expected. However, the philly's from this place are delicious. Being from CA,  they definitely dont skimp on the meat and there better than any Philly's Best chain sandwich from back home..."}
{"text":"A rare occasion when i disagree with one of my fav Vegas foodies , Ms. Blair B.   Now granted, I'm in a desperate state trying to find some variety on the Eastside for my lunch fix.  Luckily, i'm only out and about 2 times / week so i  usually hit catfish alley,  Pho Thanh, las pupusa and a few others.  I think this place comes close to  Capriotti's - darn close.  And come on, at a run down gas station ? Now granted, i'm not a cheesesteak expert, though i've eaten at geno's and Pat's ( i prefer Pat's )  but on one of my visits i brought along a PA born cheesesteak \"expert\" - he gave the place a thumbs up      I tried the Cheeseburger my last visit - $3.95 for a 1/2 pounder with cheese and grilled onions ...ehhh ok.   I noticed a south philly cheesesteak place at trop and pecos near the BofA - I'm thinking a two hour lunch - hit them up and then off to play me  some pinball !"}
{"text":"I got seriously bummed out when I tried this place.   Bummed out I did not try it way before now.   I was craving a cheesesteak. I knew this place was here so I didn't bother searching for another cheesesteak place.   Walked in and rang the bell. The guy got right to the counter.   I got a medium chicken cheesesteak with wiz and onions.  Medium is 12\". The large is 18\". Definitely wasn't that hungry.   The sandwich was awesome! Next time I'll add some hot sauce but thats just me. I dont remember one ever being as good from pops.. I doubt I'll ever go there again now that I have tried this place.   If you're iffy on it cuz its in a gas station or for what ever reason, give it a try. Super good and will hit the spot if your craving a Philly cheesesteak the proper way."}
{"text":"The perfect go-to sandwich! Oohhyy gooie chessy melted goodness. In a hurry? Want to split a sandwich with a friend? This footlong steak sandwich is the perfect choice for the Philly Cheesesteak lover and the gal on the go."}
{"text":"this place has the best cheesesteak in the valley when they have cheese wiz, without the cheese wiz it's just a plain ol sandwich. which is not as good. pls keep wiz in stock the wiz really makes the philly. I would give this place a 4-5 stars but not having cheese wiz all the time brings it dwn to 3 stars. It's NOT the same without the cheese wiz!!!!"}
{"text":"I am shocked. Small seating area, parking lot small but then again this place is in a gas station. With all this being said the food was great. First time there but not the last time. Next time I'm in Vegas I will stop by again. Price is good, staff was nice and wait time was short."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town for cheese steaks. They are so good!!! I usually get chicken instead of beef. It's not dry at all. So worth trying!!!"}
{"text":"These are the best Philly steaks you can get in Henderson without a doubt.  It's the only place I go to when I don't feel like driving all the way to Pop's.  My only issue with this place is that that they skimp out on the steak a little bit.  It's like a bread and cheese hoagie with a tasting of steak added.  Still, although they skimp on the meat... They are the only place in the area that does a cheesesteak right.  I hope they'll fix the balance eventually."}
{"text":"It's inside of a Sinclair gas station, the cheesestakes and fries were pretty decent. Just make sure you have your own ketchup because the one at the gas station is pretty old. The customer service could have also been better. Probably won't be back though."}
{"text":"I and this place for work and we still go there now and again but for me the sweet and hot peppers at caps beat it even though the meat is a little tastier at this places IMO  contrary to everyone else opinion I dislike the set up in the gas station I think it's super awkward and confusing and the employees don't really care to help you out with figuring it out...   So IMO I would never eat there because its just weird eating in the gas station but getting it to go is not bad just not one hundred percent worth the price for my money to satisfaction ratio... I have only had cheese steaks though but since its the name I feel that's what everyone goes there for!!!"}
{"text":"The cheesesteaks here are really really good!!! I came here after recently eating at another place nearby and seeing the sign for Philly Cheesesteak Factory.  I was surprised this was in a gas station which seems just completely odd, but I was not dissapointed in the cheesesteak at all.  Unfortunately because this is in a gas station you cannot sit down and eat, so this is better for take and go plans.  Really good if you need a lunch stop while working and can take it back with you.  I've had some Philly Cheesesteaks that were better, but that is more because other places have more variety.   If this place can come up with more options like Garlic cheeseteaks, bacon cheeseteaks for example, they would be even better.  For now, I will still return and eat the delicious cheesesteak, but will only give 4 stars due to the fact that you cannot sit down and eat.  Maybe they will eventually move into their own store with seating available and expand the menu a bit."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here after church and it was delicious!!! The location is a lil rough around the edges. We didn't go there for the comfy seating.... We tried the chicken and beef philly, both good. We preferred the beef. Try it if you love Philly cheesesteaks, we were pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Really Really Really Good Phillies, don't mind that it being inside a gas station, it was delicious as hell!"}
{"text":"Don't let the fact that this place is located inside of a convenience store/gas station fool you. They put out the best Philly cheesesteak in Las Vegas. Their prices are very affordable too. My wife & I split the 18\" cheesesteak for $9.98. You can eat at the little counter, or pick up a bag of chips & a drink out of the cooler & be on your way. Don't forget the cheese whiz!"}
{"text":"For what is is, food is AMAZING.  Little place in a gas station.  Get double meat on the cheesesteak, it's only a few dollars more."}
{"text":"Yes it's in a gas station but it's really good food and a really low price $2 for seasoned french fries really good price and really good tasting."}
{"text":"Waited in the gas station for 10 minutes to try this place. Not sure if they just didn't want to help us or if they were on break but the gas station attendant went to get the guy 2 different times and he still didn't come to the front to help us. We went an hour before closing. What the heck? Went and found a great option somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Hands down best ever!!! Both steak and chicken Sammys are AMAZING.  Sits inside a Sinclair gas station at the corner of pecos and Patrick.  Made to order so takes a couple of minutes. The fries are also amazing. The fries are in a paper bag so no styrofoam ( soggy fries) you could eat this two/three times a week easily! Go now"}
{"text":"I had stopped a couples of times to get something from the mini mart and after smelling the food being cooked I finally decided to try a Cheesesteak. I like mine with meat and cheese only and I really liked it. I loved the thin chopped steak and found the seasoning to be spot on. The price was very reasonable. I will for sure try this place again."}
{"text":"I bought a pack of menthols and tried on sunglasses while the antisocial neckbeard made my philly cheese steak. It was hot and fresh tasting. $8 or so for the medium with everything but some dubs on that piece and we're out the dizoor!!"}
{"text":"pretty good for a gas station sandwich shop. LOL The portions are good and you can customize your Cheese steak.. needs help on the seasoning in my opion i went home and poured Tony Chachere's and hot sauce on mine.."}
{"text":"Best Philly in Vegas hands down and the wings are bomb as hell... Former employee so I know what's up!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great but they don't stick to their hours and the guy who always works there is super unfriendly."}
{"text":"I'd give this place five stars, but the counter person is a lame. He's so unpersonable. The food is delicious and the wings are excellent! The prices are fair, considering what you get. We paid $20.85 total for two sandwiches and an order of wings."}
{"text":"Nobody compares to this place!! You may question it based on it being in a gas station, but I promise you won't regret trying this place!"}
{"text":"I liked this place alot. I grew up outside of Philly but always made it a point to eat when I went there. Moving to Las Vegas i saw a few places that said Philly STeak in or associated with their name and they were all dissapointing. Geri's was mentioned and I tried it out, no very impressed and will not go back there. The PCF has some really good flavors and although I am a provolne fan on mine the american cheese used here was pretty good. I am definately not a wiz kid..lol.  This was the best tasking steak sandwhich I had in Vegas and wouldn't say it's even that close to a Philly. I did the Pat's and Geno;s thing, Pat's is way better but Tony Luke's is my fav! Not that big of a Cappriotti's steak but their chicken cheese steaks are really good."}
{"text":"This is another sandwich shop in a gas station, so that's kind of a negative on ambiance (even though it's a pretty nice gas station...as gas stations go), but it means you have an excellent selection of drinks and chips! The cheesesteaks are good and really packed with meat, but the bread is kind of lacking. Prices are excellent - $8 for a medium cheesesteak, which was more than enough for me and my husband to split. Overall, a solid choice for a cheesesteak in the area if you're in a hurry (also, a good choice for Sundays since Geri's on Trop isn't open)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The philly cheese steaks are amazing too.   Try the wings also!"}
{"text":"Do not let this place fool you being in a gas station.. I promise you it will be the BEST philly sand which u have ever had. And the price will also be the BEST. These sandwiches and even their burgers are worth every cent and does not break the bank... I love this place and recommend it to everyone I know."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Vegas to get a Philly cheese steak sandwich.  However, it is in a gas station, so don't be surprised.  It is made to order.  The portions are generous and the price is reasonable.  I'll drive across town for this one."}
{"text":"Yes, it's in a gas station.... Get over it! That doesn't take away from the quality of the sandwich. Sandwiches are made fresh to order. The bread was warm, soft, and fresh. And the steak was tender! Perfect blend of wiz and meat and plenty of toppings to chose from! We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, I moved here from Minnesota.  The best Philly's I found in MN were from a gas station.  In fact, two different places served up amazing ones in gas stations.  So I don't know why I would doubt that the best Philly's would be in a gas station here.    There are not words to adequately describe the pleasure of eating one of their Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches.  No it's still not as good as the real thing in Philadelphia, but it is as close as I've had especially out here.  The pricing is so cheap, and if you're really hungry they offer a 24 inch option.  Yes that's 2 feet of amazing deliciousness!    It's easy to miss this place, as it is located inside the gas station.  However if you're hungry don't overlook this amazing establishment.    The bread was full of flavor, the steak was cooked well and mixed great on the griddle with the peppers, onions, mushrooms, and cheese.  The steak was full of flavor, and the toppings were a perfect addition.  The first bite was like meeting an amazing memory of taste of the best cheesesteaks I've had in my life.  Subsequent bites were enough to convince me that I will be back whenever I'm looking for a cheesesteak.  The only downer- though the gas station is always open, the Cheesesteak shop is not.  You have to catch this deliciousness between \"normal\" lunch and dinner hours.  Sadly they're not open at 5am when I'm getting out of work and looking for a quality cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Not a bad sandwich for gas station food. Infact, its the best meal I have ever had at a gas station. I agree with some of the other reviews, the  bread is the week part. I prefer chopped onions as well. But still a good sandwich"}
{"text":"So my coworker brought me a Philly cheesesteak sandwich to work one day. My first bite... It was amaaaazing! I don't usually get sandwiches like this cos I don't like steak but I'm so glad he brought me that sandwich. Ever since that day, I would crave it a couple of times a week but couldn't get it cos I didn't know where to get it from. All he told me was that it was from a gas station, which I couldn't believe btw. So I searched Yelp and thank goodness this place is just down the street from my work!!   Anyways, I went back. Got the large (18\") philly cheese steak with onion rings to share with my bf. He thought the sandwiches were from capriottis lol. So that's saying something cos we love that place. I'm deducting a star cos the onion rings were just not great. Sandwich is bomb tho so yay for great finds!"}
{"text":"At the advice of my cousin and his wife, I finally decided to try the Philly Cheesesteak Factory and I'm definitely a fan! Sure, this is a small counter inside a service station in what could only be classified as middle of nowhere Las Vegas, but these sandwiches are really great and the value is even better! I would still have to say that quality wise, Pop's is pretty easily the best cheesesteak in LV but for what you would pay $10 for at Pop's will only cost you $7 here. The beef is chopped/sliced slightly finer than I'm used to but still, it's pretty darn good. In summary, the cost is 70% of Pop's but the flavor/quality is 80-90% that of Pop's. In LV that's what I call a good value bet!"}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST CHEESESTEAK IN LAS VEGAS! The way is done is just perfect! Not too clean, not too messy, just perfect! Make sure you get everything in it! No disappointments at all! The people that work in it are cool folks too! It surely is a hidden gem on the east side that my wife and I discovered while putting some gas! Yes they're in a gas stop. Idk, but that makes them even cooler! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Hate to give any restaurant less than 4-5 stars, but this was just my personal review rated from my own tastebuds.  I had ordered the biggest size cheesesteak. Large. Thinking it was going to be really good.  Keep in mind I love cheesesteaks and they were my first love before sushi lol, and I've tried plenty of cheesesteak places. The only employee working at the time took my order plus cooked it for me.  He handed me two sandwiches assuming it's pretty large and he cut it half. Right off of the first bite, I knew I did not enjoy it.. It tasted like regular skirt steak, unflavored meat with a lot of provolone cheese on an Albertsons hoagie roll. Maybe I'll come back and try their meatball sub or something. It just wasn't for me personally, but to each is own!  Thanks anyways Philly Cheesesteak Factory!"}
{"text":"I always get the Philly Cheesesteak with just meat and cheese. I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have bought their cheese steak sandwiches quite a few times. They were awesome!! However tonight it took us over a half hour to get an answer by phone and when the nasty girl did answer she let my husband know she was too busy to make a special order unless it was everything on it!!  Won't go back with that nasty chick. In n out is is tonight!! We will find another place with a good attitude!! What happened to the really nice guy who worked there?? He was great!!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended from a co-worker but we ended up being disappointed. We showed up at 6:45 and they were already cleaning the grill for the night.. not sure when they close, but we probably should have taken it as a sign and kept walking.   Because it was \"late\" we could only get sandwiches.. no fries, etc. Luckily you get to eat in a gas station, sooo you do have a great selection of chips.. whoo. The steaks were just OK. At $6.95 for a small, they are a tad pricey and honestly I think capriottis makes a better steak. Skip this one."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical with it being in a gas station convenient store but to my surprise the philly was pretty delish! Not overly priced & the sandwich had tons of meat! This is my new Philly cheesesteak place for sure :)"}
{"text":"The best cheesesteak sandwich in Vegas can only be found in a gas station on the eastside. Yeah, I'm talking about the Philly Cheesesteak Factory.  The price is right, portions are generous, and your cheesesteak is ready in less than 5 minutes.   The hoagie roll is steamed and softened. Each cheesesteak comes with fried onions, cheese, mushrooms, and peppers at no additional charge. (They're not out here trying to nickel and dime you.) I've had them with provolone and Cheez Whiz, but prefer Whiz because it makes for a juicier cheesesteak.  I heard through the grapevine that this place is so popular, our armed forces regularly place orders for the legendary cheesesteaks and have them shipped.  Geno's, Pat's, Tony Lukes, and Jim's Steaks in Philadelphia ain't got nothin' on the Philly Cheesesteak Factory in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I stopped for lunch. I got the Philly cheesesteak and an order of seasoned fries. The Philly did not have a lot of flavor so I had to add salt and pepper to the sandwich. There was a good amount of meat, cheese, onion, and green bell pepper on the sandwich but not enough to cover the roll from end to end. I was disappointed in the quality of the meat....it was like steak em. The seasoned fries were cooked perfect but was a small portion. I will give them another try someday...."}
{"text":"The best Philly cheeseteaks in town.  Don't expect a friendly face to greet you hi, bye, thank you.  But if all you care about it is the delicious food then you are in the right place.  The cheese steaks are delicious, down to the bread, the thinness of the meat, the seasoning.    Just show up, place your order, pay at the register and pick up your delicious cheese steak with the grumpy cook of the day."}
{"text":"Before Yelp this was mine and my brothers little hidden secret. Now I try to get a philly and it's super packed with blue collar folks raving about how a gas station serves these great sandwiches. Thanks Yelp for making this place a trend. Now all you Yelp elites should move on to a different gas station. The beef philly is great and so is the chicken philly. Get over it."}
{"text":"I have had a lot of philly cheesesteaks in my 50 some years, this place was the absolute worst.  The meat was flavorful but extremely dry.  It could be from the fact that the 7 sandwiches we ordered had no cheese on them at all.  First when we called about it they stated that the cheese was mixed in the meat.  After calling bs on that one person took their unbeaten portion down to them. They said well we fold the meat around the cheese is in the middle.  He owned the sandwich and ask I'd they could identify the cheese in the sandwich they could not and made a new sandwich.  I called after to ask why they didn't replace the other sandwiches as well  after a few choice words from the male employee u spike to I decided to hang up instead of listening to his rant anymore. I will not be visiting our eating at this place again."}
{"text":"Last night I was craving the philly fries. We called In our order  before 7pm ( we did not know they closed at 7). Our order was ready in 15 minutes- that should of gave it away because they are not the fastest in getting food out. The cook - not very personable had our bag ready to go. My error I did not check our order before we left. When we got home we were disappointed- there were limited fries (we ordered 2 large) and not very fresh. Needless to say, we will not be going back. Customer service is poor and the food was horrible."}
{"text":"I'm from Philly so I know a good cheesesteak. The cheesesteak wasn't bad, but the rolls are definitely not Philly cheesesteak quality."}
{"text":"Thee best Philly steaks on the east side   Don't be fooled by the gas station, this is by far the tastiest Philly chicken and steak sandwiches.  The bread is soft, quick service.  Great prices!"}
