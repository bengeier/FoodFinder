{"text":"Just the worst sushi you could ever get. Fast food sushi is literally better than this."}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky about what sushi I like to indulge in, but Kiro Sushi is one of my new favourite spots in Toronto. Not only is the service always great, but the rolls! I am amazed at how they have such fresh fish, always generous with the quantity at their rolls and it's quality. I've always been very impressed by what the chef's make for us. I like ordering the deluxe sushi Maki combo. Very fresh, VERY flavourful and always leaving me full. The sushi rolls are on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for. The atmosphere is calm and quiet, just how I like it and they maintain cleanliness to the ninth degree. What a lovely new addition to the neighbourhood! Thanks Kiro Sushi!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this newly opened Japanese restaurant. The quality, taste and presentation were excellent, way above the standards of most Japanese restaurants in the same price bracket. There were 4 of us for dinner. I ordered the salmon teriyaki which was beautifully presented with 2 generous portions of perfectly cooked fish, asparagus, assorted vegetables, rice, miso and salad all under $20.00. The chicken teriyaki, tempura udon and nabeyaki udon were all delicious. The service was excellent even down to our waitstaff Ben opening the door for our departure.  The decor and choice of music was calming and the washrooms were clean and welcoming.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"It was my first time to actually walk out of a restaurant before I even tried the food. There was a waitress litterrally looking like she did not want any customer to come in or she was just having a bad day. As we were directly led to a table, she did not say a work and threw the menu on the table and walked away. The interior was quite nice and the other waiter seemed friendly, but apparently he wasn't looking after any table at that moment. There was one more table besides ours, just got the bill. Again, the waitress wasn't saying any word and she had a gesture giving her hand out to the customer to get a credit card or cash. Her eyes were looking down. We were very uncomfortable with her gestures and facial expressions so walked out of the restaurant. And her? Was smiling at us or more like smirking. She was the weirdest worker I have ever seen at a restaurant."}
{"text":"great sushi experience. My girlfriend and I had the bento box with short-ribs, and they were amazing. I will definitely visit Kiro Sushi again!"}
{"text":"My friend And I go here all the time! We mostly get take out but we've sat down in the restaurant a few times and we love it! Spicy Salmon and the Dragon roll are one of my favourites! Also there glassy noodles(I think that's what there called) they are also one of our favourites!!"}
{"text":"Bigger portions than expected, fresher fish than expected, lower prices than expected!  All of these point to a great experience. Honestly, the only reason why they didn't get five stars was because they played Michael Bolton elevator music the entire time.  Recommended for meetings, work lunches, families, and date nights (if they don't mind some dated saxophone tunes, that is)."}
{"text":"Cheap quality.  Should have bought from Superstore and will next time I'm in the area and need a sushi fix until other options open on 130th."}
{"text":"Great service, good sushi with some interesting specialty rolls."}
{"text":"I'm giving Kiro 3 stars for the service and the new restaurant feel. But how can some of you review this on the dragon rolls? Should we not be reviewing this based on how close it is to their tag line \"authentic Japanese food\"? I've never seen a dragon roll served in Japan and really rolls in general take up a very small spot on any authentic Japanese menu. So let me review the udon soup (I ordered udon because there was no ramen. Umm what??). It was definitely a packaged broth and certainly did not feel or taste like the love and care that any Japanese chef would take with a broth. It had some mushroom and onion thrown on top.   Sooo...if you want a fast and reasonable dose of Canadianized or in this case Chinese sushi then this is your place. This is not however an authentic Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"$25 tuna lover's meal with sashimi, nigiri and maki did not disappoint. The fish was fresh and thickly sliced. So far a better joint in the Yorkville area as shogun is a bit pricey and sushi inn was lackluster and skimped on ingredients."}
{"text":"I love this Japanese restaurant. Best one I have been to in the yorkville area.  I often get lunch and dinner from here.  Everything is good.  My favorite is the spicy maki dinner set."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. Everything was perfect!  I had the korean short ribs bento and my friends had the sushi and sashimi dinner. Everything was nicely plated and fresh, We thought it can def compete with Japango which is another Japanese restaurant we love!"}
{"text":"Kiro was a real find. Their sushi and sashimi are wonderful, and the salmon teriyaki is the best I have ever had.   This casual space has the ambiance of a much more expensive Japanese restaurant. The service is friendly and efficient and the price was even more pleasant."}
{"text":"Went there for a late night dinner with friends. Service was decent. Food was decent. Not special or anything, just decent...until I woke up at 5 in the morning with food poisoning. Definitely not going here again."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this somewhat new restaurant a try as it's close to my office. The server was very welcoming as I gave my take-out order. As I waited, she offered me a glass of water. They must store their glasses up right as there was a film of dust floating on top of the water - I didn't drink it.  I took the order back to my office, got halfway through and noticed a thick black hair tangled up in the roll.  I promptly returned it. They offered to make me a new one, I declined and receive my money back."}
{"text":"The place is a nice little hide out. Servers speak English, Japanese, and Korean. In their menu(At the time of my visit) they had amaebi which I trully  love the taste of but was hard to find (yes it was thawed and it did take a long time to receive it, but if you are a connosuer? It is definitely worth it.) and customer service is definitely there as well. The only recommendation I may give for them is,  do not place the lemon on the sashimi as it will give the fish acid burns and alter the taste and visual unless you are aiming for acid burn based tataki of some sort. I know they are trying to show that it is fresh, and I know visual is part of the dining experience but still.. if it alters the taste... If placing the lemon is really important, then make the bamboo leaf that is placed under should be three to four times bigger than its current size to correct the matter. It would make it look like a surprise, like opening up a Christmas present. Except this one little flaw, it is a great place... I would go again for sure, and ask that lemon not be placed on top of my sashimi.  P.S. The rolls are ok. Just don't ask for the rolls to be without rice, as they may not  be up to par yet. But this can be overlooked because the overall quality of everything else is great and not many people ask a maki to be without rice unless they are on a gluten free diet. ;).  Overall, a great place. Definitely worth a visit for its value.(Great Tuna sahshimi by the way)"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were lower as I read the negative reviews just before eating here. But I enjoyed the food and the service, and it was child friendly which is nice. I didn't feel like we had to be overly quiet. Overall I enjoyed the experience.   One thing is they do add the tip directly into your final bill price and then upon paying the debit /Credit machine asks if you want to tip. If you're adding the tip into the final bill before hand the machine shouldn't then ask again for a tip. Maybe that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"After a wonder around the city, I was hungry and wanted some sushi. I happened to be by the library and found a restaurant with good google and yelp reviews. Oooof it's delicious. The lunch combos are affordable and the maki is amazing. I got the spicy tuna avo and dynamite combo and the dynamite roll was warm and melted in my mouth. Yaaaas please!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal here. The food was delicious and very fresh. Presentation was great and the service was also excellent. I generally feel that most sushi places are more or less similar, but tonight's meal felt a step above the rest!!"}
{"text":"Great place a bit pricy but the food was delicious and fresh. Good presentation. Staff was friend me and helpful. I loved this place"}
{"text":"Is it the location that always makes this place a ghost town when I visit? When it was Ichizen, it was just as quiet and empty, and I'm almost always the only person in here.   Food is decent; don't come here, or any Japanese restaurant in Calgary, hoping for a super authentic Izakaya experience where the chef tosses you out if you deign to ask for more wasabi. I appreciate that they have gluten-free soy sauce, and don't mind making changes to their menu items to suit dietary needs. Their website is also really easy to navigate and straight to the point, which makes for easy ordering ahead when getting take out.  Last time I was here, service was 2.5-3 stars out of 5, at best. It took almost half an hour for the waitress to come back and check on us, even though, again, we were the only people there the last time I was in. However, she was very friendly and knew the menu like the back of her hand.  I suppose the upside to having a restaurant almost all to yourself whenever you visit, is that I can sit wherever I like. It's always very clean, and the furniture and decor hasn't changed since they were Ichizen. I made sure to avoid the special veggie out roll, as, even though it's delicious, each piece is the size of a sandwich. And until someone tells me the secret to elegantly eating giant pieces of sushi, without trying to shove the entire thing in your face and trying not to tear up while you choke on rice sticking to your throat as you try to force it down; it's something I'll avoid, especially on a date. If they were half the size, they'd be a winner.   So, yes. 3, leaning toward a 3.5. I won't go out of my way to visit Kiro, but I like them :)."}
{"text":"The sashimi dinner was incredibly bland. The fish was either old or not prepared properly.   Probably the worst sushi I have ever had."}
{"text":"Here for a yoga conference and staying in the Yorkville area . Googled sushi restaurant and this one popped up . Gave it a whirl and yep it was great ! No pics to show because  the yumminess is in ma belly .. service great , sake great and atmosphere intimate if one had a date to bring here.Being an American .. prices most appealing."}
{"text":"This place is very clean and quiet, I went at 4 thinking I wouldn't be able to have the lunch menu but I still was given the lunch menu. The waitress was very kind and tentative to my needs. I ordered the 4 pieces sushi and 2 maki rolls (spicy salmon and dynamite). The sushi was very good, the salmon being bigger than the rest of the pieces. The sushi tasted fresh and melted in my mouth. But I really did not enjoy their rolls. The dynamite roll was okay, nothing special at all. I could go to a grocery store and get a box of sushi and still tasted better. There was random chunks of salmon under the roll. The salmon roll was just off. The flavour tasted bad and the rice was falling off."}
{"text":"Pretty good if you're in the area, it was a nice surprise! The booths are roomy and the service was pleasant.  We shared the pork katsu dinner and sushi dinner. Presentation was very nice and everything tasted fresh. Only critique would be the pork katsu was a little dry.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this small sushi place. I ordered the Sushi and Sashimi combo and would come back to order again! The combo offered a variety of fresh fish, prepared in different ways. I will definitely return next time I have a sushi craving."}
{"text":"I just took a few coworkers out for lunch here and the food was pretty good.  I ordered the vegetable udon soup and their lunch special A (2 maki rolls + soup and salad).  The udon soup was pretty good, but slightly pricey at $13.  In terms of their lunch specials, they have various specials ranging for $8.95 to $15.95.  For two rolls (there's a choice of 8 or so - I got a couple of veggie rolls), miso soup and salad - it was $8.95.    The rolls were pretty good quality.  They definitely put effort into the presentation.    As for my colleagues, they both ordered the bento boxes.  One of them ordered steak and I think the other ordered chicken.  They were $10.95 and $9.95 respectively and came with edamane, dumplings, rice, 4 rolls, soup and salad.  I looked at the beef and it seemed like it was cooked well and pretty good quality.    From what a coworker was saying, she thought the quality was better than Wow sushi.  I don't know about that, but the value is definitely there.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"Worst service. Was in with family and the waitress was looking at us the entire time as I passed my friend a can of drink to put in their bag. Next thing they put a sign up saying no outside drink!!! Lol seriously and sushi was not good at all."}
{"text":"Phenomenal sushi. The deluxe maki rolls are amazingly fresh and are all delicious. Friendly staff  1 caveat: the music is tragic but no big deal."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try since it just opened a few days ago. Overall very nice atmosphere inside but I did order take-out. I ordered a spicy tuna and avocado roll, dynamite maki and a spider maki. I attached a pic of all 3 rolls. The spicy tuna was ok, but not spicy at all. The dynamite maki was also decent but lacked much flavour( I guess the shrimp was just steamed but no sauce or anything or it.  The spider maki was a bit weird with asparagus in it which I have not had anywhere before which overpowered the soft shell crab taste. Overall it was ok but for a $32.77 bill, I get the portions were small and the taste was just ok. I think this place has a lot of potential but still has to do some perfection of the rolls still."}
{"text":"Great food with great price. The service here is awesome and food is definitely fresh and tasty. I highly recommend this place for casual dinning."}
{"text":"Tonight (June 12th, 2017) was my first time eating here. There is nothing against this restaurant but as all sushi restaurants suffer ever since I have eaten at Kinjo- no sushi restaurant compares. Especially because I feel like every sushi restaurant copies Kinjo. However, being that sushi is such a trend right now it's hard to do something that is not already done. Generally if sushi restaurants aren't Kinjo they either get a 2 or 3 star rating so for this place to get a 4 star and it's not Kinjo - is good! This is because of there veggie roll! It was amazing and I am not a vegetarian! They used tomato for once which is my favourite vegetable and I have never seen it be used in a sushi roll and it was awesome!  Another roll that was delicious was the beef roll because it tasted like beef carpaccio! It was delicious.  This restaurant lost a star because they don't give complimentary pockys at the end like Kinjo does which really shows how they appreciate there customers :)"}
{"text":"Lovely Japanese restaurant with freshly cut sashimi! Great variety of fish with acceptable prices and amazing quality. Ordered Sashimi+Sushi combo for 32$ and it's worth it!  Tried Kiro Maki and Cowboy Maki. Personally I Really like the cowboy maki Since the taste of beef&mushroom were perfectly combined with awesome sauce. Chicken Karaage was great! Friendly service but I hope the table coule be cleaner. I'll definitely revisit this place!"}
{"text":"Very slow service and the staff was very misleading about how long the food would take too arrive. The sushi was decent but way over-priced. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Wow this place was expensive. Came here to get take-out before studying at the library. Very fresh sushi, tho, and the salmon teriyaki was really tasty. I believe take-out is 10% off after $25. Disappointed because the menu said a maki roll was 8 pieces and I only received 6."}
{"text":"Best at Yonge and Bloor. Fresh. Tasty. Service is friendly. Food is prompt. Sushi is not loaded with rice, which is a nice change."}
{"text":"High quality and generous portion sashimi and sushi, they have the thickest slices of sashimi I have ever seen. Pricing are competitive and reasonable. At the end of the meal they would serve you a nice little cup of their tasty coffee."}
{"text":"Food is generally good, but service is absolutely horrible. There were 4 tables and 2 waitresses - couldn't get service or anyone to notice you unless you go up to them. Just clueless."}
{"text":"An nice hidden gem in Yonge-Bloor area. Probably one of the best sushi I had at its given price. Very generous for their sashimi size. Service seems a little rush for non-rush hours."}
{"text":"Fresh, affordable lunch specials with friendly staff. What a great spot close to the Toronto Reference Library! Service can be a little slow, but they take their time plating it nicely. Watch your step when going to the bathroom though, it's hard to see the caution tape if you're paying attention."}
{"text":"Their prices are similar to that of Globefishes but the quality of the sushi is much lower. Fast service and good restaurant setup though with nice staff"}
{"text":"Kiro Sushi is located on 130 Ave South East Calgary. It's a small sushi restaurant in the local community. It provided both order menu and all you can eat menu to customers. People can eat in and take out food from the restaurant. My boyfriend and I went to Kiro Sushi on this Friday after the work. We had a nice dinner there.  Food:  After looked at the order menu, we decided to have all you can eat at Kiro Sushi instead of order dishes. We had two special rolls, sashimi, appetizer, salad and Udon. All the food came out the kitchen in order. They were all fresh and well cooked. The taste of the food was decent. The special rolls were awesome. The taste of them was much better than other sushi restaurants we have eaten in Calgary. Appetizer Takoyaki balls were OK. The taste more likely like frozen balls warmed up from the microwave. We liked miso soup. The miso soup was fresh, warm and lots of seasoning stuffs inside. It was very tasty. Sashimis were in the small slices. I was so glad we had All you can eat.  Service:  The servers were very nice and friendly. After we sat down in the restaurant, the server came to our table and brought both menus to us. Also, the server brought the tea and water to us.  Environment:  Kiro Sushi is a small sushi restaurant. Inside the restaurant is very tidy and clean. We arrived the restaurant at 5 pm when the restaurant just opened. The restaurant was not busy at all. After few minutes, we could see that there are lots of people order food to go. About 6 or 7 pm, more and more people came to this restaurant and ate in the restaurant.  Prices:  The prices of the food were a little bit expensive compared to most the sushi restaurants in Vancouver. The all you can eat is around $30 per person. Two of us spent $70 for the dinner.  If you are a big eater, I strongly suggest you order all you can eat.  In summary, we had a very good experience at Kiro Sushi. Recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"The servers were attentive, and sweet. The presentation and variety was fantastic, I liked all the maki we ordered and would highly recommend the Dragon Roll, Volcano Roll & Dynamite (probably not as traditional but nevertheless every bite was delicious)"}
{"text":"I just stumbled in here, but I was really surprised by the quality of the maki and sushi. Fresh, light flavours, not too much rice (a typical sin of less expensive sushi shops).  The only negative was the basic salad, which was on the slightly-too-sweet side.   Great surprise - would happily come back."}
{"text":"This place is right beside my house and I was pumped to have a sushi place so close! Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy my food that I ordered, and although I am 95% sure I ordered just a green salad, I got something completely different. When I asked the waitress she reassured me this was a green salad. It had unwashed beets in it (which beets in a green salad is really different for a sushi place), and was overall tasting like dirt. I didn't finish it.  The sushi was ok, but not anything amazing. It was decorated with dandy lions which I've seen before in other places, but it was a little off putting here.   The presentation of both items my boyfriend and I ordered was fantastic but for what we got, it's quite pricy in comparison to the place directly around the corner. I may be back since I went a few days after it opened, and maybe things were shaky! Hopefully things have improved, but for now I'm giving it 3 stars as I didn't enjoy the food I got for the price I paid."}
{"text":"Under new management but the changes are finished yet.  The service was fast and friendly but the sushi is only mediocre. Good for a local place for a fast fix but if its a special night out, venture farther."}
{"text":"Update:  Stopped in for lunch, they had specials, and cooked foods were really good!  Short ribs were tender and not overcooked like most places.  Chicken breast teriyaki was tender and flavourful.  GREAT VALUE, especially during lunch which is also served during the weekends!  Based on the reviews, this was one of the better sushi places in the Bloor/Yonge/Yorkville corridor.  Space is new, modern/fusion, and dimly lit, ideal for a date night!  As with all of these fusion-y places, there seems to be more of an emphasis on whether or not you want an alcoholic beverage.  Anyway, the nigiri/maki combo that we ordered came with a nice assortment of fish - as opposed to salmon, salmon, & more salmon.  There was attention paid to plating.  Some pieces were even grilled which I enjoyed.  All pieces of fish were fresh.    This place actually reminded me of Wow (when it was good) and Japango.  Since I didn't pay, I can't really comment on price point! ;)"}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem tucked away off the main street. The staff here is super friendly and very responsive.  We ordered a few things off the menu and we enjoyed everything. The fish was very fresh. Our favorite was the sashimi. They gave a great variety and also offered some lightly smoked varieties which we enjoyed fight for.   Overall a great place. I'll be back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"YES!  Kiro sushi is one of the best sushi places I've found downtown near my office.  Quality is consistent and the sushi rolls have a good rice to filling ratio. What locked me in here are the teriyaki ribs. They aren't tough and the fat just melts in your mouth. I'd recommend their lunch or dinner special if you plan on getting them.  In the past 7 days, I've eaten there 3 times and am planning a 4th.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I'm usually very picky with my sushi places and hardly ever agree to try new ones unless a friend pickier than me refers me. However, this place was an exception. It opened a few days ago, right next to my building after two weeks of expedited renovations. We walked in. There were candles on all tables. (Trust me this is nice enough to be mentioned for a sushi place on Yonge.) we started off with Miso soups and edamame and later ordered a rainbow, two green dragons and a tempura.  Miso was amazing. It was rich and tasteful. The rolls were big but cut in thin pieces and garnished beautifully. Fish was super fresh. Green dragon came in 12 pieces in a huge boat shaped dish.  I always go to AYCE sushi but this place filled me just as much with a slightly higher price but much better quality.   Flaws: they still had stickers on their glasswares which I'm sure they'll soon get rid of. They also didn't have a half-litre wine carafe so we had to get glasses.   I highly recommend this place. Welcome to the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"Can't beat the beef short rib bento box for lunch!! Its a small place but does not disappoint. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Wonderful mackerel sashimi and warm sake. The seafood udon contained 3 types of mushrooms, limitation crab meat, narutos, an egg, and a big piece of shrimp tempura. The sushi comes on big wooden blocks that look like chopping boards. When it came time to pay, it took us a long time to get a waitress to come to us to give us the bill. For 10 minutes, they were either out of view or not looking in our direction. Other than that the food and sake was excellent."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi! I moved to Calgary 1.5 year ago and I am a sushi lover. This place is one of the best ones that I have tried so far. The place is nicely decorated. Totally recommended."}
{"text":"Overpriced and very average. We ordered the salmon avocado, spicy white tuna, shiitake mushroom maki and the Kiro roll. The salmon avocado roll and shiitake mushroom roll weren't bad but very messily rolled. The white tuna was actually awful. It was watery and fishy. Probably wasn't properly frozen/refrozen/thawed. We didn't finish it. One of the worst tasting sushi's I've had in a while. The Kiro roll was also very meh. It was super tiny for a $12 roll and it the sweet sauce was way too overpowering on the fish.   And the wait. OMG. We had to have been waiting for half an hour at least and there were only 4 other tables there. We overheard another table complaining about the wait and the server had the nerve to tell them it was because they were waiting on fresh fish!!! Really? At 7:30pm on a Saturday... just apologize and comp some edemame or something. It's really that easy. Don't try to make up some bullshit excuse for your serious disorganization.   Will never go back."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to go out for sushi and chose Kiro. It's a nice quiet location, inside is lovely, great set up. We ordered Rainbow Maki, Dragon Maki, Salmon Fusion, Dynamite Roll, and Volcano Maki. I personally am not a sushi person, but out of all of them  Dragon Maki and Dynamite Roll were the best! The Salmon Fusion and Volcano Maki weren't so great, only had a few of the Volcano Maki till I was dissatisfied. Kiro is a bit pricey, all you can eat buffet might be a better option if you want to eat till your full."}
{"text":"Kiro Sushi is the only close sushi restaurant in our neighborhood that I would buy sushi from (Copperfield). I think the biggest thing for me is the consistency. It's not the best sushi, but it's consistently alright and the service/delivery is quick.   We have ordered delivery from them multiple times and our order is always correct and they taste fresh. Recently, we came to visit for a sit down and their service is great and food arrives quickly.  For the quality and price of sushi they offer, it is definitely worth it. I really liked their spicy California roll, spider roll, and dragon roll. You can also order the large size for the specialty rolls if you like eating large amounts of sushi.   They also gave us a small portion of their chapjae for free while we were waiting for our order. And if you are visiting for a sit down and change your mind about sushi, they also offer korean bbq.  Overall, I would recommend Kiro Sushi to friends and family that live in the far SE."}
{"text":"Not sure where the bad reviews came from but I just ate here a week ago and it was amazing! I've been to a lot of Japanese restaurants, and this might be one of my favourite. The service was great, food is excellent and the place itself felt very welcoming. I would definitely go back here again and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"We recently got takeout sushi from Kiro. The place itself is cute so we had wished we were dining-in. Their service was quite quick and the lady we dealt with was nice.   The sushi however was mediocre. I think it's over-priced for the quality that you're getting. Since it's so close to home we may give it another shot at some point but overall it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Not crazy about the sushi but the beef Udon is good as long as the beef isn't all fat. It's hit or miss. Also, I could do without having to hear the guy in the back hack up a lung while I'm eating. From what you can see of the kitchen, it looks disgusting. The soy sauce tastes like they watered down the low-sodium stuff. The sushi is overpriced and just tastes off."}
{"text":"What to say about Kiro Sushi ? Must say, definitely a fan of the food ! Having tried eating in for lunch and ordering take out for dinner, both experiences were quite positive. During the lunch hours, they're pretty busy so service was a bit lacking. It was hard to get the waitress' attention for some addition tea. Takeout was called in advance and the person on the phone was very accommodating and patient. Made an order for six  Now for the food...the presentation was on point. The attention to detail was spectacular, it was a piece of edible art on a plate. Even the takeout was presented neatly, definitely did not cut corners just because it was in a plastic container. Prices were also very reasonable for what is served. There's a 10% discount for takeout, bonus !  Overall, will be eating more from here. As a sushi lover, this place is approved ! Definitely put this place on the to try list, if it's not on already."}
{"text":"The sushi here is very good quality. Definitely one of the better places in the city. Price is a bit high, especially compared to the place around the corner, but in my opinion, worth it for how good and fresh the sashimi is. Their lunch specials are well portioned and are much more affordable at just $8.95 to $18.99. I got the 2 maki roll (which you have a choice of) and 4 pieces of sushi lunch combo. It came w a miso soup and salad. The sushi was made with HUGE pieces of very good quality fresh fish (salmon, butterfish, tuna and red snapper) and the rolls were also not skimpy on the protein either (I ordered the spicy butterfish and spicy scallops). I was SO (wonderfully) stuffed from my 12.95 meal! Presentation was lovely and servers were pleasant. Overall a great lunch, which I will return again for!"}
{"text":"Ive dined her a couple of times.  It is definitely a hidden gem By yonge and bloor. Sushi quality and taste is also amazing."}
